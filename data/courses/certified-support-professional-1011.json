at\nthe Apple Certified Support Professional\n\n4\n00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:15.920\ncertification show, here on ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.970\nNow the ACSP's been around for awhile,\nwe've actually filmed it a few times.\n\n6\n00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.990\nThis time we're doing an update to\nthe El Capitan operating system release.\n\n7\n00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.870\nWith each new version of Mac OS,\nwe get changes, changes to the UI,\n\n8\n00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.160\nchanges to the software.\n\n9\n00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.860\nAnd we update to refresh and reflect\nthat in our certification training.\n\n10\n00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.457\nSo that's what we're doing right here.\n\n11\n00:00:33.457 --> 00:00:37.497\nIf you want to learn all about supporting\nEl Capitan out there in the real world,\n\n12\n00:00:37.497 --> 00:00:41.008\nif you're trying to support OS 10.11,\nthis is where it's at.\n\n13\n00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.320\nNow, there's a lot of overlap\nwith previous versions.\n\n14\n00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.080\nIf you're already certified\nin a previous version,\n\n15\n00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.250\nyou'll find that this is mostly the same.\n\n16\n00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.760\nJust a handful of utilities have changed,\nand things that you may encounter.\n\n17\n00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.950\nBut on a bigger side, we have some new\nsecurity features in OS 10.11 that\n\n18\n00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.890\ncan impact how we deploy applications and\n\n19\n00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.830\nsupport the machines out\nthere in the real world.\n\n20\n00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.740\nWell, before I get ahead of myself,\nlet's start with what is the ACSP?\n\n21\n00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.400\nThe Apple Certified Support Professional\nis a certification designed for anybody\n\n22\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.630\nwho's out there supporting Macintosh\ncomputers in a business environment.\n\n23\n00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.770\nWe're not talking about home users.\n\n24\n00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.320\nYou might have one, two,\neven five Macs at home, and\n\n25\n00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.660\nthose you really just\nmanage them individually.\n\n26\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.420\nBut when you have a 100 Macs, a 1,000,\nwhen you've got MacBook laptops,\n\n27\n00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.860\nand Mac Pro desktops, and iPads, and\niPhones, and you've got all these\n\n28\n00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.910\ndifferent Apple devices, it sure would be\nnice if we had some kind of way to manage\n\n29\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.680\nthem in a network where they all play\ntogether and, well, perform nicely.\n\n30\n00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.730\nAnd then when you had problems,\nthat you knew the steps to go\n\n31\n00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.920\nthrough to troubleshoot and\nresolve those issues without having\n\n32\n00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.700\nto rush right out to the Apple Store and\nget them to fix it for you.\n\n33\n00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.620\nThat's what the ACSP is all about.\n\n34\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.700\nIf you're one of those people that's\nout there having to support Macs\n\n35\n00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.210\nin your environment,\nthis is the show for you.\n\n36\n00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.850\nNow, you might have Windows\nmachines in your environment.\n\n37\n00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.420\nYou might have just a handful of Macs, but\n\n38\n00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.590\nthere's still a lot you need to\nknow just to keep them up and\n\n39\n00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.480\nrunning and healthy, and\nthat's all stuff that we see right here.\n\n40\n00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.432\nAll right, now the ACSP,\nit covers a lot of different topics.\n\n41\n00:02:07.432 --> 00:02:10.428\nIt's a bit all over the place.\n\n42\n00:02:10.428 --> 00:02:13.910\nAnd the reason is it's part of the whole\ncertification track from Apple.\n\n43\n00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.440\nSo let me bring up Apples's Training and\nCertification page here.\n\n44\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.610\nAnd what you'll see is that they\nhave a number of certifications.\n\n45\n00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.350\nAnd at the time of this filming, some of\nthem have been updated to El Capitan,\n\n46\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.910\nsome them are still at Yosemite, so\n\n47\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.080\nyou'll see several down here\nlisted here under Yosemite.\n\n48\n00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.820\nBut on the El Capitan side,\n\n49\n00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.470\nwe've got the Apple Certified\nSupport Professional right there.\n\n50\n00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.790\nThat's the name of the certification.\n\n51\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.130\nWhen you pass the exam you get your ACSP.\n\n52\n00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.770\nThe required exam, though,\n\n53\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.239\nis actually called\nthe OS X Support Essentials 10.11 exam.\n\n54\n00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.500\nAnd that exam gets updated\nwith each release of Mac OS.\n\n55\n00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.730\nThey have to update to\nreflect the new changes.\n\n56\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.160\nSo, if you take this one exam,\nyou get this one certification, the ACSP.\n\n57\n00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.190\nNow, the ACSP is one certification map.\n\n58\n00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.800\nWell, there's actually two others.\n\n59\n00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.760\nThe ACA, or Apple Certified Associate,\nthat's considered the entry point.\n\n60\n00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.659\nSo if you're just getting started\nwith Apple certifications,\n\n61\n00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.676\nit's better to start with the ACA\nthan to jump right into the ACSP.\n\n62\n00:03:08.676 --> 00:03:12.951\nNow, they don't show it here cuz it hasn't\nbeen updated yet, but there's actually two\n\n63\n00:03:12.951 --> 00:03:16.790\nACAs right here, Mac Management Basics and\nMac Integration Basics.\n\n64\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.430\nOne of them focuses just on Macs,\nMac Management Basics.\n\n65\n00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.430\nThat one has a lot of\noverlap with the ACSP,\n\n66\n00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.720\nso that's a great place to start\nbefore going into the ACSP.\n\n67\n00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.240\nMac Integration Basics, on the other hand,\n\n68\n00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.610\nfocuses more on getting Windows\nto play nice with Mac OS.\n\n69\n00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.270\nIt's not necessarily tied\nin to what we do in ACSP.\n\n70\n00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.044\nSo if you're just starting out, I do\nrecommend doing the Mac Management Basics\n\n71\n00:03:39.044 --> 00:03:42.500\ncertification first, and\nwe've already filmed that here at ITProTV.\n\n72\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.340\nIt's in our course library,\nyou can jump right over and watch it.\n\n73\n00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.747\nAnd even though Apple hasn't updated\nit for 10.11 yet, we already have.\n\n74\n00:03:48.747 --> 00:03:49.627\nSo it's in there in 10.11.\n\n75\n00:03:49.627 --> 00:03:53.674\nI mean, you can go back and watch our 10.9\ncontent, or whatever, if you want, but\n\n76\n00:03:53.674 --> 00:03:56.460\nwe've already updated it for El Capitan.\n\n77\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.070\nNow, once you get your ACSP, you are now\nan Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n78\n00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.250\nYou've shown that you're able\nto support Macs in a network.\n\n79\n00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.440\nAnd if you wanna go the next step up,\n\n80\n00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.170\nthe next step up is\nthe Apple Certified Technical Coordinator.\n\n81\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.180\nAnd this is designed not for somebody\nwho's just supporting Macs in the field,\n\n82\n00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.290\nbut somebody who's running\nthe IT department.\n\n83\n00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.720\nYou might not be the person that's\nactually out there doing the grunt work,\n\n84\n00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.900\nbut you're the one calling\nthe shots on the bigger picture.\n\n85\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.410\nSo, designing that overall infrastructure,\nwhat solutions do I deploy?\n\n86\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.930\nThat's the ACTC.\n\n87\n00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.043\nAnd if you want to get your ACTC,\nyou have to have the ACSP first.\n\n88\n00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:36.171\nYou've gotta pass the ACSP, and\nyou've gotta pass the ACTC exam.\n\n89\n00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:41.140\nAnd once you pass both of them, then you\nget your ACTC, so you've gotta have both.\n\n90\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.427\nYou can actually skip the ACA if you want,\nyou don't have to do those.\n\n91\n00:04:44.427 --> 00:04:48.028\nIf you have been working with Macs for\nyears and you're really comfortable with\n\n92\n00:04:48.028 --> 00:04:50.943\nthem, you can start right off with\nthe ACSP and jump right in it.\n\n93\n00:04:50.943 --> 00:04:55.351\nBut if you have no experience, you\nwanna start at the ACA level first, and\n\n94\n00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:56.640\nthen jump up to ACSP.\n\n95\n00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.860\nAll right, so that's where this falls\nin the Apple certification scheme,\n\n96\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.140\nlet's talk about what's on the exam.\n\n97\n00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.770\nIt covers a lot of great content,\n\n98\n00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.626\nwhich are topics that are things that\nwe're gonna deal with in the real world.\n\n99\n00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:11.440\nAnd I've kind of made a quick list here of\nthe topics that we cover in the show, so\n\n100\n00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.750\nlet's bring that up.\n\n101\n00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.810\nWe start with Installation and\nConfiguration.\n\n102\n00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.590\nHow do you get Mac OS installed?\n\n103\n00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.730\nIf you've only worked with\nthis in a home environment,\n\n104\n00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.860\nyou know that when you buy a Mac\nit's already got Mac OS on it.\n\n105\n00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.460\nBut there's many times where you\nmight want to deploy it yourself.\n\n106\n00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.360\nYou might have 1,000 Macs that\nare out there already and\n\n107\n00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.720\nthey're all running Mavericks, and you\nneed to get them upgraded to El Capitan.\n\n108\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.650\nOr you might want to\nbuild a standard image so\n\n109\n00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.780\nthat all your machines already have\nsoftware installed when you deploy them.\n\n110\n00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.130\nWe talk about that.\n\n111\n00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.580\nThen we talk about User Accounts.\n\n112\n00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.160\nHaving individual user accounts on\neverybody's computer is fine, but when\n\n113\n00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.030\nyou've got 1,000 computers, it's tough to\nmaintain that, it's tough to manage it.\n\n114\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.960\nSo having centralized user accounts and\nspecial network type authentication\n\n115\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.960\nis a really valuable thing to have,\nso we talk about those.\n\n116\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.370\nWe talk about File Systems.\n\n117\n00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.140\nWhen it comes to storage on a Mac,\nit supports a number of different things.\n\n118\n00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:05.900\nInternal and external storage, we have\nour Apple OS X Extended Journal format.\n\n119\n00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.760\nIt's a big name.\n\n120\n00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.920\nWe have Microsoft's NTFS and FAT32 and\nall these different file systems.\n\n121\n00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.530\nAnd we talk about how they function inside\nof the Mac, and how you can use them and\n\n122\n00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.810\nsome of the little caveats involved there.\n\n123\n00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.910\nWe talk about Data Management,\njust backing up our systems,\n\n124\n00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.070\nkeeping them healthy, keeping our\ndata safe, where to store data,\n\n125\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.220\nhow permissions work on our data\nwhen it's on those file systems.\n\n126\n00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.150\nThen we talked about Applications and\nProcesses.\n\n127\n00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.170\nMac OS is great, it's really easy to use,\nbut out of the box it doesn't have a ton\n\n128\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.670\nof software in it, it's got all\nthe Apple software and that's about it.\n\n129\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.730\nSo you're likely going to have to\nsupport third party applications, and\n\n130\n00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.670\nwe talk about that.\n\n131\n00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.060\nHow to get the applications loaded, how to\nmanage them, how to troubleshoot them when\n\n132\n00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.300\nthey start eating up too much CPU or too\nmuch memory, we cover all that content.\n\n133\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.050\nThen we jump into the networking world.\n\n134\n00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.220\nHow to get our system setup to\ncommunicate on the network.\n\n135\n00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.130\nAnd on the networking side,\nwe start off really with just IP networks.\n\n136\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.150\nSo how do you get two Macs to where\nthey can even see each other?\n\n137\n00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.290\nAnd once they can see each\nother on the network,\n\n138\n00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.650\nthen we move into Network Services.\n\n139\n00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.495\nAll right, great, your two computers\nsee each other, what do you do now?\n\n140\n00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:06.399\nHow can you share files,\nhow can you share folders,\n\n141\n00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:08.650\nor printers, or even CD and DVD drives?\n\n142\n00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.840\nHow do you share any of those\nresources when two computers see each\n\n143\n00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.690\nother on the network?\n\n144\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.820\nWe cover all of that.\n\n145\n00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.090\nAnd then we wrap up the show just\ntalking about System Management,\n\n146\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.950\nand a better name for that section\nwould really be troubleshooting.\n\n147\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.270\nWhat do you do when the Mac is not\nbehaving the way it's supposed to?\n\n148\n00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.900\nWe know it has all these great features\nthat are supposed to work like magic, but\n\n149\n00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.800\nsometimes it just doesn't work out that\nway and we've got to troubleshoot it.\n\n150\n00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.454\nSo I spend a lot of time in that\nsection covering all the really amazing\n\n151\n00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:39.935\ntroubleshooting tools that are built into\nMac OS and built into the Apple hardware.\n\n152\n00:07:39.935 --> 00:07:42.848\nAnd it's part of what makes that\necosystem so valuable to us.\n\n153\n00:07:42.848 --> 00:07:45.670\nSo those are the topics that we're gonna\nbe covering throughout this series.\n\n154\n00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.478\nIt's all broken up into 30 minute\nepisodes that are nice and\n\n155\n00:07:48.478 --> 00:07:50.120\neasy to consume and watch.\n\n156\n00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.630\nWe cover it all,\nit's a great certification.\n\n157\n00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.860\nI really like this one because\nit covers real world skills.\n\n158\n00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.850\nEvery one of these technologies are ones\nthat I've used in the real world.\n\n159\n00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.410\nSometime you get these certifications\nwhere they cover technologies and\n\n160\n00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.130\nyou look at it and you're like, wow,\n\n161\n00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.130\nthis is more like a marketing slide,\nI'm never gonna us this is real life.\n\n162\n00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.170\nBut this is stuff you will.\n\n163\n00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.000\nEverything in here are things you'll\nencounter on a regular basis, and\n\n164\n00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.880\nit's excellent knowledge to know.\n\n165\n00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.453\nSo I encourage anybody who\nsupports Macs in a school or\n\n166\n00:08:14.453 --> 00:08:18.170\nbusiness environment, anywhere where\nyou have more than, say, ten Macs,\n\n167\n00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.390\nit's really valuable to do\nthe certification, it's a great one to do.\n\n168\n00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.660\nAll right, so let's say you watched the\nshow, you learn all the great information,\n\n169\n00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.970\nyou're ready to take the test,\nyou wanna get certified.\n\n170\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.570\nWell, the ACSP is a little\nbit different than the ACA.\n\n171\n00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.070\nThe ACA exams,\nthe Mac Management Basics and\n\n172\n00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.780\nMac Integration Basics, you can take those\nonline from the comfort of your own home.\n\n173\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.770\nYou sign up right on Apple's website and\nthat's it.\n\n174\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.910\nBut with ACSP and ACTC,\n\n175\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.606\nyou can only take them at Apple\nAuthorized Training Centers, or AATCs.\n\n176\n00:08:47.606 --> 00:08:49.640\nNow, there are AATCs all over the world,\nso\n\n177\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.630\nyou just need to find one that's near you.\n\n178\n00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.550\nAnd if you go to Apple's website,\nif you go to training.apple.com,\n\n179\n00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.390\nthey've actually got a lot of\nthem located right on there.\n\n180\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.580\nYou can search and find them and\nregister for the exam.\n\n181\n00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.890\nBut the point is you've gotta\ndrive there to take it.\n\n182\n00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.620\nSo you've gotta go somewhere and\nactually take this exam.\n\n183\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.050\nThe exam is two hours long,\nso it's a long exam,\n\n184\n00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.940\nyou're gonna be in that\ntesting booth a while.\n\n185\n00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.080\nIt's got 80 questions, so it's about\na minute and a half per question.\n\n186\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.400\nAs long as you stick to that, you'll\ncome in on time and finish the exam.\n\n187\n00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.433\nIf you take more then a minute and a half\non a question then you might run out of\n\n188\n00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:21.142\ntime, right, so you've gotta stay\nfocused and move through it.\n\n189\n00:09:21.142 --> 00:09:24.260\nOf the 80 questions,\nthere's 5 that aren't scored.\n\n190\n00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.378\nThey're kind of like demographic\nsurvey-type questions where they're just\n\n191\n00:09:27.378 --> 00:09:30.100\ntesting out something, and\nso they don't count those.\n\n192\n00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.470\nBut you don't know which five they are.\n\n193\n00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.670\nSo it really doesn't matter\nthat five of them are unscored,\n\n194\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.020\nyou need to do well on all of them.\n\n195\n00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.760\nThe questions are mostly multiple choice.\n\n196\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.760\nYou'll find that almost every\none is multiple choice.\n\n197\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.220\nSome will be true and false, and\nothers might be a media experience,\n\n198\n00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.360\nwhere it shows you a picture of\nthe system preferences screen.\n\n199\n00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.980\nAnd it says click on the system\npreference that does xyz task, and\n\n200\n00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:51.740\nyou've got to click on the one.\n\n201\n00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.920\nSo, its a graphical element\ninvolved in the question.\n\n202\n00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.860\nBut the bulk of them are just multiple\nchoice and so you can use process of\n\n203\n00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.290\nelimination and the other things we've\nhoned through years of public schooling,\n\n204\n00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.320\nright, to figure out what\nthat right answer is.\n\n205\n00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.180\nAnd I'll be honest with you guys,\nthis exam is really straightforward,\n\n206\n00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.070\nthere's no trick questions on there,\neverything is really practical.\n\n207\n00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.830\nIt really is a great certification,\nI've always been pleased with this one.\n\n208\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.430\nIt's a neat one.\n\n209\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.400\nNow, the exam cost, I can't really\ntell you that because it varies based\n\n210\n00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.940\non region, whichever country you're in.\n\n211\n00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.610\nThey have different pricing,\nand so it can vary.\n\n212\n00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.980\nBut it's not a terribly expensive exam.\n\n213\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:32.000\nThe only hard part is having to go to\nan AATC to take it, so just remember that.\n\n214\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.080\nBut, otherwise,\nthat's basically it for the exam.\n\n215\n00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.330\nSo I've talked about the ACSP\ncertification is, I've talked about what\n\n216\n00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.370\nwe're gonna cover on the show, all those\ndifferent topics that we need to know,\n\n217\n00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.670\nI also talked about where\nwe can take the exam.\n\n218\n00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.730\nThe only other thing that I wannna mention\nis that Apple has a really good study\n\n219\n00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.070\nguide for the ACSP.\n\n220\n00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.040\nLet me get back to their\nwebsite real quick, and\n\n221\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.450\non the page that I was showing you,\nthis is me at training.apple.com.\n\n222\n00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:03.690\nSo if you go to training.apple.com, you\ncan find the OS X Certifications section.\n\n223\n00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:08.180\nAnd under OS X Certifications, you'll\nfind where it tells you about that exam.\n\n224\n00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.230\nAnd over here to the side, you'll\nsee where it tells you to get ready,\n\n225\n00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.800\nthere's an El Capitan 101 Course.\n\n226\n00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.180\nThat's an official course you can\ntake at the AATCs if you want.\n\n227\n00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.590\nAnd there's an Exam Preparation Guide.\n\n228\n00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.440\nDownload that guide, it's free,\nit doesn't cost you a dime.\n\n229\n00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.230\nYou can download it.\n\n230\n00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.510\nIt is, I can't remember exactly how\nlong it is, about 75 pages, I think.\n\n231\n00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.860\nAnd it tells you a little bit\nabout the exam and what to expect,\n\n232\n00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.500\nsome of the different things that\nyou can kind of expect to see.\n\n233\n00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.010\nAnd that helps you to get ready.\n\n234\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.750\nAnd between that and\nthe content that we cover in the show,\n\n235\n00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.560\nyou'll see the bulk of what's\ngonna be on that exam.\n\n236\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.610\nYou'll be all prepared,\nready to go in there, and\n\n237\n00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.480\nready to pass and get your certification.\n\n238\n00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.720\nSo that's about it for the ACSP.\n\n239\n00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.040\nIf that sounds exciting to you,\nsomething you wanna jump in and pursue,\n\n240\n00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.370\nthen you are in the right place.\n\n241\n00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.640\nStay tuned cuz our episodes are coming up.\n\n242\n00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.350\nIf it's not the right place for you, well,\nif you're just getting started with Apple,\n\n243\n00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.260\ndefinitely check out our ACA content.\n\n244\n00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.320\nThat Mac Management Basics is\na great show to start with.\n\n245\n00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.490\nYou can have never used an Apple\na single day in your life,\n\n246\n00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.740\njump right into Mac Management Basics,\nand you'll fit right in.\n\n247\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.630\nGet through that, and then come over\nhere to ACSP, it'll be a great fit.\n\n248\n00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.970\nIt's all part of the ITProTV library so\nyou have access to it.\n\n249\n00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.370\nJust jump over there and\ntackle it, it's great content.\n\n250\n00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.280\nIf Apple's not your cup of tea,\nif

00:00:17.644\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:21.610\nwe're gonna be diving into our Apple\ncertified support professional.\n\n5\n00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.780\nWe got none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet to help us out.\n\n6\n00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.040\nDon, how are you doing today sir?\n\n7\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.637\n>> I'm doing great Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:27.901\nReady to kick off our new series and\n\n9\n00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:31.884\nwe're going to be kicking off\nthings at the very beginning,\n\n10\n00:00:31.884 --> 00:00:37.212\nwhich is basically, what we need to do\nbefore we install OS X El Capitan, right?\n\n11\n00:00:37.212 --> 00:00:40.342\nSo, a lot of people get excited, and\nwant to roll out that brand new OS, and\n\n12\n00:00:40.342 --> 00:00:42.900\nget it deployed as fast as possible but\nthere's a few steps.\n\n13\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.629\nA few little kind of checklist items that\nwe need to get knocked off of our list\n\n14\n00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:47.864\nbefore we dive right in.\n\n15\n00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:48.932\nAnd, that's where we're gonna start.\n\n16\n00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:52.320\nAnd, as a support professional, you're\nthe one that has to know this, right?\n\n17\n00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.010\nSo, when a new operating\nsystem rolls out from Apple,\n\n18\n00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.620\nyou might not be ready for it on day one.\n\n19\n00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.620\nYou might not be able to just roll that\nout right across your entire environment.\n\n20\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.650\nYou've got to do a little planning.\n\n21\n00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.811\nSo, we're gonna talk about\nthat planning right here and\n\n22\n00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:06.170\nkind of step through that process.\n\n23\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.682\nSo, the first thing that we need to\nunderstand is that, just because Apple\n\n24\n00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:13.217\nrolls out a new operating system doesn't\nmean that you can run it, right?\n\n25\n00:01:13.217 --> 00:01:17.805\nThat, your hardware may or may not be able\nto support that, so Apple is a lot better\n\n26\n00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:21.864\nthan other vendors that are out there\non supporting older hardware, but\n\n27\n00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:23.480\nthey've got their limits.\n\n28\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.010\nThere's only so far back they'll go, so,\n\n29\n00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.950\nwhen a new version comes out the first\nthing you need to determine is whether or\n\n30\n00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.010\nnot your hardware is\ncapable of running it.\n\n31\n00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.670\nSo, OS X El Capitan comes out.\n\n32\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.490\nI'm excited about it.\n\n33\n00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.030\nI wanted to play it.\n\n34\n00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.117\nI need to start by checking my hardware,\nright?\n\n35\n00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:41.718\nAnd, they are exam objectives so\nwe definitely need to know them.\n\n36\n00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:45.878\nBut, even in real life, it is nothing\nworse than going to deploy the operating\n\n37\n00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:49.472\nsystem and then finding out that\nyour computer is abnormally slow or\n\n38\n00:01:49.472 --> 00:01:52.670\nfunctionality is not working or\nit's crashing.\n\n39\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.050\nBecause you're running on unsupported\nhardware and for the most part,\n\n40\n00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.250\nApple will stop you but, there are times\nwhere you can break that rule.\n\n41\n00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.340\nSo, just a few high-level things for\nus, what we need to know.\n\n42\n00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.000\nFirst off, El Capitan will run\n\n43\n00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.310\npretty much on any hardware that's\nrunning Snow Leopard or higher.\n\n44\n00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.090\nSo, if you're running OS 10 10.6.8,\nit's very specific, 10.6.8 or\n\n45\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.210\nhigher, then the odds are you\ncan run El Capitan, right?\n\n46\n00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.970\nIt's not 100% but\nthe odds are you're okay.\n\n47\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.131\nAnd, Snow Leopard's pretty old, hopefully\nnone of you are running that, so, really,\n\n48\n00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:30.854\nwhen we go out and about you really expect\nto see like Mountain Lion, Mavericks,\n\n49\n00:02:30.854 --> 00:02:33.490\nYosemite, those are the ones\nyou expect to see.\n\n50\n00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.537\nIf you're running something older, yes,\nyou can probably run El Capitan, but\n\n51\n00:02:37.537 --> 00:02:41.765\nyour hardware is probably not supported by\nApple anymore, so if you have problems,\n\n52\n00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:43.275\nthey're not gonna help you.\n\n53\n00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:45.930\nAnd, if you take it down to\nthe Genius Bar, they're gonna try and\n\n54\n00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.344\nsell you a new Mac because your\nhardware is really old, so,\n\n55\n00:02:48.344 --> 00:02:50.685\nwe normally expecting to see\none of the more modern ones.\n\n56\n00:02:50.685 --> 00:02:55.307\nBut, if you're running 10.6.8 or\nhigher, then you are very\n\n57\n00:02:55.307 --> 00:03:00.690\nlikely to support El Capitan, right,\nI have to say that, very likely.\n\n58\n00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.820\nSo, think about your hardware, right?\n\n59\n00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.210\nAnd, if you don't know, or maybe you've\nput on a different version of OS X, or\n\n60\n00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.270\nyou've messed with your computer or\n\n61\n00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.720\nwhatever, Apple does actually post\na listing of the hardware they support.\n\n62\n00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.750\nAnd, just to run through a few of them,\niMacs,\n\n63\n00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.550\nanything from 2007 to current, right?\n\n64\n00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.360\nNow, this video,\nwe're filming this in 2016, so\n\n65\n00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.690\nthat means they're going back\nnine years on iMac hardware.\n\n66\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.440\nThat's pretty impressive.\n\n67\n00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.420\nIf you're running a nine-year-old iMac,\nwell, that's not unusual.\n\n68\n00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.640\nApple uses good hardware right,\nit'll last a long time.\n\n69\n00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.960\nBut, that system's getting\na little long in the tooth.\n\n70\n00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.900\nIt's going to be slow.\n\n71\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.752\nIt's not going to be snappy and\nfast like our modern processors are.\n\n72\n00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:40.587\nYou're going to want to\nconsider an upgrade.\n\n73\n00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:45.378\nIf you've got, on a MacBook,\nI think they started in 2008 in that,\n\n74\n00:03:45.378 --> 00:03:50.015\nthe late 2008 models,\non the MacBook Pros, it's the 2007,\n\n75\n00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:53.570\nthe late 2007s, Macbook Air, it's 2008.\n\n76\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.790\nOn the Mac Pro, on the desktop,\nit's 2008 and newer.\n\n77\n00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.854\nAnd then, on the Xserve,\nif you still have that, it's the 2009 and\n\n78\n00:04:00.854 --> 00:04:03.076\nnewer, which they don't\nmake the Xserve anymore.\n\n79\n00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.795\nSo, that's pretty old hardware, right?\n\n80\n00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:07.999\nWe're talking about 2007, 2008, 2009.\n\n81\n00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.530\nThese are eight years ago, right?\n\n82\n00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.840\nSo, Apple's really good\nabout supporting that.\n\n83\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.860\nKinda have a blanket.\n\n84\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.420\nNow, when I say 10.6.8,\nI have this specific cutoff.\n\n85\n00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.480\nRemember, I don't know if it will\nturn up on the exam, but for\n\n86\n00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.680\nyour own knowledge,\nthe main reason we have that cutoff is,\n\n87\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.370\nthat's where an Apple\nstarted going 64 bit.\n\n88\n00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.870\nAnd so,\nEl Capitan only has a 64 bit version.\n\n89\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.070\nThere is no 32 bit version of El Capitan\nrelease, not that I'm aware of.\n\n90\n00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.030\nSo, when you do the install,\nthat's really what it's checking and\n\n91\n00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.340\nthat's why we have that cutoff date.\n\n92\n00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.310\nSo, don't just assume that you can\njump right in and deploy El Capitan.\n\n93\n00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.150\nYou've got to be in that list\nof computers that I just named.\n\n94\n00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.100\nAll right, so\nwe've gotta check that out, and\n\n95\n00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.750\nwe're gonna see how to\ncheck it out right here.\n\n96\n00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.510\n>> Don, does architecture, like many\nother operating systems and vendors,\n\n97\n00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.940\narchitecture, is that important?\n\n98\n00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.866\nWe can install 32 bit on 64,\ncan't install 64 on 32,\n\n99\n00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:57.740\nis it something we have to keep in mind?\n\n100\n00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.833\n>> Right, if you have got older hardware\nand it's got a 32 bit Intel processor, or\n\n101\n00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:04.340\na Power PC,\nlet's go even further back, right?\n\n102\n00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.330\nWe've got one of those RISC processors\nin there, well, you can't upgrade that.\n\n103\n00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.390\nI can't retrofit that to make it 64 bit.\n\n104\n00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.420\nWhen the 64 bit machines came out,\n\n105\n00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.580\nyou could actually run 32\nbit on them if you wanted.\n\n106\n00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.230\nApple didn't recommend it,\nthey recommended you went 64.\n\n107\n00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.300\nAnd now, they're all 64 bit, so\nit's not really something we can change.\n\n108\n00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.240\nThe solution is to buy a new computer,\nright?\n\n109\n00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.240\nIt's time to upgrade.\n\n110\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.418\nYou've got a nine year old system,\nit's time to upgrade.\n\n111\n00:05:27.418 --> 00:05:31.070\n[LAUGH] So, that's,\ntry to put it this way.\n\n112\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.610\nThat's probably the easiest\nway to upgrade to El Capitan.\n\n113\n00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.190\nBuy a computer with it pre-installed.\n\n114\n00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.730\nIf you go to an Apple store right now and\n\n115\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.690\nbuy a Mac,\nit's going to have El Capitan on it.\n\n116\n00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.840\nThat's how it is, right?\n\n117\n00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.440\nAnd, that's the easiest way to upgrade.\n\n118\n00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.860\nIt's also the most expensive.\n\n119\n00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.950\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n120\n00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.730\nJust because you've got an older\ncomputer doesn't mean you can't run it.\n\n121\n00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.190\nSo, for example, I've got a Mac Mini\nsetting over here to my side, or\n\n122\n00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.560\neven my own laptop which is Macbook Pro,\nboth of these are a few years old.\n\n123\n00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.030\nAnd neither of these\nshipped with El Capitan.\n\n124\n00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.080\nMy laptop shipped with Yosemite, no,\n\n125\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.830\nactually I think it\nshipped with Mavericks.\n\n126\n00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.470\nSo, my laptop shipped with Mavericks,\nthis Mac Mini, if I remember right,\n\n127\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.290\nit came with Mountain Lion I believe, so\nthese are systems that had to be upgraded.\n\n128\n00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.480\nAnd, I've upgraded them, I've upgraded\nto Mavericks, I've upgraded to Yosemite,\n\n129\n00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.560\nand now it's time to\nupgrade to El Capitan.\n\n130\n00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.360\nNow, because I'm running\nYosemite on this Mac Mini,\n\n131\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.690\nI know that it's gonna\nexport Mavericks too, right?\n\n132\n00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.290\nSo, that's easy or I'm sorry, El Capitan,\nI tend to mix up my names, right?\n\n133\n00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.970\nSo, if you can run Yosemite,\nMavericks, whatever,\n\n134\n00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.544\nthen upgrading to El Capitan\nis pretty much a given.\n\n135\n00:06:31.544 --> 00:06:32.984\nBut it's still a good idea to check.\n\n136\n00:06:32.984 --> 00:06:36.600\nSo, what we need to do is we\nneed to determine a model.\n\n137\n00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.457\nI listed a bunch of models a minute ago\nand really, it was all starting around\n\n138\n00:06:39.457 --> 00:06:42.649\n2008 that we got that support, so you\nneed to make sure that you're supported.\n\n139\n00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:44.734\nSo, if we take a look at this Mac Mini,\n\n140\n00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:47.668\nall you have to do is go up to\nyour Apple menu up top and,\n\n141\n00:06:47.668 --> 00:06:52.140\nwhat you're gonna do here is, go to\nAbout This Mac, it's that very first item.\n\n142\n00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.320\nAnd when you go into About This Mac,\n\n143\n00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.340\nit's gonna tell you [LAUGH] if\nyou can click on it, there we go.\n\n144\n00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.940\nIt's gonna tell you what your hardware is,\nand,\n\n145\n00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.200\nwe can see right here,\nI'm running OS X Yosemite.\n\n146\n00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.550\nSo, there it is, I know my OS.\n\n147\n00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.744\nAnd, it's telling me\nwhat hardware I've got.\n\n148\n00:07:08.744 --> 00:07:12.760\nAnd so,\nthis one says Mac Mini late 2014, right?\n\n149\n00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.720\nThis is newer than I thought it was.\n\n150\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.990\nSo, late 2014, this machine's\nreally only a year and a half old.\n\n151\n00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.000\nIt's not very old at all, so it's pretty\nmuch a given that I can run on El Captain.\n\n152\n00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.300\nSo, that's the first\nthing we need to check.\n\n153\n00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.200\nBut it's not the only thing.\n\n154\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.260\nWe also need to make sure that\nwe have enough memory and\n\n155\n00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.290\nhard drive space for the upgrade.\n\n156\n00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.320\nSo, the minimum amount of\nmemory is two Gigs of RAM.\n\n157\n00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.670\nAnd, if we look at this one, I can see\nright here, memory, 8 Gigs of RAM.\n\n158\n00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.320\nSo, I've got enough memory for\n\n159\n00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.960\nthis, I'll be able to do the upgrade,\nI've got plenty.\n\n160\n00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.409\nBut if you only have one Gig of memory,\nit's not gonna be enough for El Capitan,\n\n161\n00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:47.915\nyou're going to need to upgrade.\n\n162\n00:07:47.915 --> 00:07:51.400\nAnd, it wasn't enough for Yosemite, it\nwasn't enough for Mavericks either, right?\n\n163\n00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.339\nSo, this should really be if\nyou're running an older system.\n\n164\n00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:56.948\nIf you're running Snow Leopard and\nyou're ready to do the upgrade.\n\n165\n00:07:56.948 --> 00:07:59.783\nYou may only have 1 Gig of RAM and\nit's not gonna be enough.\n\n166\n00:07:59.783 --> 00:08:02.366\nDon, you know one of the questions I have,\ncan you do like,\n\n167\n00:08:02.366 --> 00:08:05.986\nand I'm not exactly sure what the term is,\nI know I've heard the term before like,\n\n168\n00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:09.556\nbridgehead type migration, where you go\nfrom the older operation system to the,\n\n169\n00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:13.106\nmaybe not the brand new operating system,\nand then you finally go to El Capitan.\n\n170\n00:08:13.106 --> 00:08:15.978\nDo you have to do those incremental\nupgrades or can you go from say,\n\n171\n00:08:15.978 --> 00:08:18.710\nlet's say Mavericks to right\nover that old El Capitan?\n\n172\n00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.980\n>> You can jump straight up from\nMaverick from Yosemite, from\n\n173\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.200\nany of the modern version of OS 10, you\ncan just straight up to the newest one.\n\n174\n00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.680\nIt'll grab your settings and\nbring them over.\n\n175\n00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.850\nThere's a lot of stuff that changes,\nwe're gonna see that,\n\n176\n00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.430\nespecially when it comes to\nthings like file encryption.\n\n177\n00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.710\nSo, El Capitan has file both version two.\n\n178\n00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.039\nThat's its encryption that it uses.\n\n179\n00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.200\nIn older versions of Mac OS,\n\n180\n00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.640\nlike with mountain lion,\nyou had the original file vault.\n\n181\n00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.960\nAnd the big difference there is that\nthe original file vault would just encrypt\n\n182\n00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.210\nyour home directory, and that was it,\nversus the new version of file vault,\n\n183\n00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.560\nthat encrypts your entire hard drive.\n\n184\n00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.700\nThe two are not compatible.\n\n185\n00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.500\nYou can't run both.\n\n186\n00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.250\nYou've got to run one or the other.\n\n187\n00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.070\nAnd when you do an upgrade,\nif your home directory is encrypted,\n\n188\n00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.260\nwhat's going to happen?\n\n189\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.380\nYou can't see the data the upgrade's\nnot going to bring your data over so\n\n190\n00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.350\nthat's bad.\n\n191\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.020\nSo if you've got file vault turned\non the original file vault,\n\n192\n00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.760\nit's a good idea to go ahead and decrypt\nyour home directory, turn off file vault.\n\n193\n00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.010\nAnd when you turn it off now\nyour hard drive is unencrypted.\n\n194\n00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.590\nYou can upgrade to El Capitan.\n\n195\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.010\nAnd then, you can turn on file vault too.\n\n196\n00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.280\nAnd, encrypt the whole hard drive.\n\n197\n00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.140\nRight?\nSo, you can do a direct upgrade, but\n\n198\n00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.768\nlittle gotchas,\nlike that can get in the way.\n\n199\n00:09:25.768 --> 00:09:28.110\nAnd, file vault is usually the only\none that is a show stopper.\n\n200\n00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.500\nThe other ones are just\nkind of annoyances.\n\n201\n00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.560\nThere little things that will bother you.\n\n202\n00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.980\nSettings that you have to\nadjust after the upgrade.\n\n203\n00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.000\nSo, just bear in mind that's one of\nthe things that kinda bump in there.\n\n204\n00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.550\nAll right, now I showed you guys going\nhere into this about max screen.\n\n205\n00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.060\nAnd that's why I was able to find\nthe model of my hardware and\n\n206\n00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.620\nthat's where I was able to\nsee how much RAM I had.\n\n207\n00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.780\nOn hard disk space, well, it mentions\nthat in here to or actually no,\n\n208\n00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.350\nit doesn't, does it?\n\n209\n00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.650\nWe just get our RAM.\n\n210\n00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.940\nSo if I need to see my hard-drive space I\ncan come over here to my Macintosh HD and\n\n211\n00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.650\nI can pull up the information on that,\nor we can go to the disk utility,\n\n212\n00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.230\nthe disk utility is a little bit easier.\n\n213\n00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.100\nWhen we go into the disk utility we can\nsee how much hard-drive space we have.\n\n214\n00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.620\nNow, we have 8 gigs of hard-drive space,\nthat is not a lot,\n\n215\n00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.250\nany modern hard-drive is\ngonna have at least that.\n\n216\n00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.990\nAnd I can see on this system I've got a,\n\n217\n00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.890\nwhat do I have in here,\na terrabyte hard drive.\n\n218\n00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.260\nI've got a terrabyte hard drive\nin this thing a ton of space, and\n\n219\n00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.840\nI can see that it's mostly empty.\n\n220\n00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.880\nVery little of it's actually being used.\n\n221\n00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.530\nRight down here I can see that I'm\nactually only using 20 gigs of it.\n\n222\n00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.130\nThe rest of it's completely empty.\n\n223\n00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.500\nI only need eight gigs free.\n\n224\n00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.530\nI've got that eight gigs,\nI got plenty, right?\n\n225\n00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.120\nBut let's say you're on\nan older Macbook Air, and\n\n226\n00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.990\nyou've only got 128 gigs of storage,\nright?\n\n227\n00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.600\nThe early SSD models had very\nsmall amounts of storage.\n\n228\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.320\nYou might have your own files on there,\nand\n\n229\n00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.700\nthere's just not enough empty\nspace to do the upgrade.\n\n230\n00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.590\nYou got to have eight gigs\nof space to do the upgrade.\n\n231\n00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.490\nAll right.\n\n232\n00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.660\nThis is one place that I can go.\n\n233\n00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.270\nThere are other places that we can go, for\nexample, the System Information Utility.\n\n234\n00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.330\nAnd you might have noticed that.\n\n235\n00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.760\nWhen I was back on\nthe about this Mac screen,\n\n236\n00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.650\nif I jump back here,\nthat you can jump into system report and\n\n237\n00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.810\nthat will show you a lot of information\nthat you got very, very detailed.\n\n238\n00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.920\nRight?\nThe processor and other information.\n\n239\n00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.970\nSo you can get a lot more data\nright here that's very specific.\n\n240\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.590\nI don't normally have to come and sift\naround in here because I can find what I\n\n241\n00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.920\nneed through easier means,\nthrough Disk Utility or\n\n242\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.420\nright there in the about this Mac\nscreen but you can pull it up here.\n\n243\n00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.900\nThe nice part about this one is\nit's got hardware information\n\n244\n00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.740\nas well as software information.\n\n245\n00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.950\nI've really been talking about hardware.\n\n246\n00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.200\nThe only software I've been talking\nabout is the operating system.\n\n247\n00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.880\nBut there are other software\nthings that can cause us problems.\n\n248\n00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.890\nFor example, third party drivers\nthat we've loaded, or applications.\n\n249\n00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:44.250\nThat, just because my hardware supports El\nCapitan doesn't mean all my software does.\n\n250\n00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.418\nI know for me, one of the software\npackets that I use is VMware Fusion.\n\n251\n00:11:48.418 --> 00:11:52.360\nI use VMware Fusion all the time to create\nvirtual machines for me to learn with but,\n\n252\n00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.250\nalso to use here on the show.\n\n253\n00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:59.560\nWhen El Capitan first came out, I ruled\nit out and VMware Fusion is still worked.\n\n254\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.150\nBut it was insanely slow.\n\n255\n00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.950\nAnd it was because Apple\nhad changed some ways that\n\n256\n00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.360\npreferences get written on the backend and\nVMware Fusion wasn't ready for that.\n\n257\n00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.480\nAnd so it was bad.\n\n258\n00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.370\nIt was bad enough that I had\nto roll back to Yosemite.\n\n259\n00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.750\nI had to downgrade because I\ncouldn't use VMware Fusion anymore.\n\n260\n00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.150\nMy hardware supported it,\nbut my software didn't.\n\n261\n00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.320\nAll I had to do was wait.\n\n262\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.740\nAs soon as VMware put out an update for\nVMware Fusion to support El Captain,\n\n263\n00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.050\nI was able to upgrade again,\nand I was back in business.\n\n264\n00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.730\nThat is something that\nApple can't help you with.\n\n265\n00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.150\nThey don't know what third\nparty soft ware you're running.\n\n266\n00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.810\nThey don't know what\napplications you're leveraging.\n\n267\n00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.550\nSo their upgrade might\nbreak your application.\n\n268\n00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.650\nIt is up to the third party\nvendor to support that.\n\n269\n00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.700\nSo when we dive here, and\nwe look at our hardware, that's great,\n\n270\n00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.230\nyou get a lot of good information\nfrom the Apple perspective.\n\n271\n00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.960\nBut then when you start to get into\nsoftware, now we can start to see not just\n\n272\n00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.410\nthe Apple software, but\nalso the third-party vendors,\n\n273\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:54.190\nand what versions of drivers I've\ngot loaded and other things.\n\n274\n00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.490\nSo, I might have an HP printer\nplugged into my system.\n\n275\n00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.470\nWell, does that printer\nsupport El Capitan?\n\n276\n00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.650\nIt might, it might not.\n\n277\n00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:07.270\nI might need to go HP's website and\nsee if there's an updated driver.\n\n278\n00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.030\nAnd that's a good rule\nof thumb right there.\n\n279\n00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:14.360\nIf you're about to do an upgrade,\nyou really need to do your updates first.\n\n280\n00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.840\nMake sure your system\nis completely updated\n\n281\n00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.020\nbefore you upgrade to\nthe new operating system.\n\n282\n00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.820\nAll right,\nnow what am I talking about there?\n\n283\n00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.260\nWell, let's kind of walk\nthrough here on this machine.\n\n284\n00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.280\nApple has an official four\nstep process for upgrading.\n\n285\n00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.480\nAnd it's not just for\nEl Capitan, it's for anything.\n\n286\n00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.320\nSo, on the next version\nof OS 10 comes out,\n\n287\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.240\nthese are the four steps\nthat you go through.\n\n288\n00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.890\nStep one, check for updates.\n\n289\n00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.207\nRight now, I know what you're saying,\nI'm gonna update my OS.\n\n290\n00:13:37.207 --> 00:13:38.950\nOf course there's an update.\n\n291\n00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.170\nI mean updates for your current system.\n\n292\n00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.790\nWhen we run the El Capitan installer,\n\n293\n00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.790\nit's expecting certain\nbehavior from the base OS.\n\n294\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:52.710\nThen if the base OS is really old,\nApple might have had to pushed an update\n\n295\n00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.220\nto get it caught up to be able\nto handle the new installer.\n\n296\n00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.220\nSo, I need to update my operating system,\nand\n\n297\n00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.590\nI need to update my driver's firmware and\nother things.\n\n298\n00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.400\nSo, this is step one.\n\n299\n00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.490\nStep two, I need to update\nthe firmware for my hardware.\n\n300\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.980\nFirmware updates aren't included\nin the the normal update channels.\n\n301\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.490\nIt's a little weird.\n\n302\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.780\nMost people assume they are and\nthey aren't.\n\n303\n00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.330\nSo there might be firmware\nupdates that I need to do.\n\n304\n00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.760\nStep three, I need to back up everything.\n\n305\n00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.710\nBack up all of my data because\nthe upgrade could fail.\n\n306\n00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:20.240\nI could screw up.\n\n307\n00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.190\nI could accidentally format my hard drive.\n\n308\n00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.720\nI have this happen when you have\nboot camp partitions a lot.\n\n309\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.270\nYou can mess things up and\nall of sudden you lose your data.\n\n310\n00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.400\nThat's no fun, so we need a backup.\n\n311\n00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.450\nAnd then step four, there's some things\nthat aren't included in a normal backup.\n\n312\n00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:38.170\nThings like preferences or\nwhatever that we might need to redo.\n\n313\n00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.420\nSo if we ever have to do a fresh and\n\n314\n00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.240\nclean install, then we may need\nto put those settings in by hand.\n\n315\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.405\nSo we need to document any\nof those things like we had.\n\n316\n00:14:45.405 --> 00:14:49.820\nAnd it's normally stuff like user\ninterface, customizations or\n\n317\n00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.830\nthird party application settings, those\nare things that we might need to document.\n\n318\n00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:54.990\nAll right.\n\n319\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.830\nAnd then after that,\nnow we're ready to do the upgrade.\n\n320\n00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.210\nSo let's start with step one.\n\n321\n00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.490\nStep one is check for updates.\n\n322\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.800\nWell, on this system I know\nthat I'm running Yosemite.\n\n323\n00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.004\nSo I'm running OS X 10.10.\n\n324\n00:15:06.004 --> 00:15:08.130\nI wanna upgrade to 10.11.\n\n325\n00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.330\nBut I'm running 10.10.\n\n326\n00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.380\nIf we go back to my About this Mac screen,\nlet me get that pulled back up.\n\n327\n00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.520\nAnd when I go in here I can\nsee that I'm running 10.10 and\n\n328\n00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.095\nit actually says 10.10.2.\n\n329\n00:15:19.095 --> 00:15:20.267\nAll right.\n\n330\n00:15:20.267 --> 00:15:21.358\n10.10.2.\n\n331\n00:15:21.358 --> 00:15:24.190\nThat .2,\nthat means there was a minor update.\n\n332\n00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.620\nActually two.\n\n333\n00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.450\nSo there was 10.10.1, and then 10.10.2.\n\n334\n00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.440\nWas there a 10.10.3 or .4?\n\n335\n00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.200\nMaybe.\n\n336\n00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.960\nIf there is, I need to do that update.\n\n337\n00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.300\nSo I'm going to fire up my app store,\nand in the app store, I actually see\n\n338\n00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:42.980\nthe little red bell there that's telling\nme I do have some kind of pending update.\n\n339\n00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.935\nSo I'm going to fire that up and I'm\ngoing to jump into my update screen and\n\n340\n00:15:45.935 --> 00:15:48.091\nwe're going to see if there's\nan update on this one.\n\n341\n00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:51.344\nAnd if there is, we'll need to perform it.\n\n342\n00:15:51.344 --> 00:15:55.257\nSo it's checking, and of course it's going\nto tell me there's an El Capitan update,\n\n343\n00:15:55.257 --> 00:15:58.258\nyou should update to that But\nif I just ignore that and scroll down,\n\n344\n00:15:58.258 --> 00:16:00.750\nI'll see that there is\na software update right there.\n\n345\n00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.180\nNow the text is kind of small.\n\n346\n00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.920\nIf we zoom in on that a bit, what you'll\nsee in here is we've got a software\n\n347\n00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.960\nupdate, and it's telling me\nit's an update for my computer,\n\n348\n00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.610\nkind of vague there right, and\nI can see that it's got iTunes.\n\n349\n00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:20.330\nGot to update iTunes, that's important.\nBut we've got OSX update combined 10.10.5.\n\n350\n00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.020\nAll right, so I'm on 10.10.2.\n\n351\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.581\nThere's been 0.3, 0.4, 0.5.\n\n352\n00:16:24.581 --> 00:16:29.600\nThere's been three updates since then to\nthe base OS so I need to do that update.\n\n353\n00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.480\nI need to get it applied to the system.\n\n354\n00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.660\nOtherwise, this whole thing might\nnot work out so well for me, right?\n\n355\n00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.870\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and hit Update.\n\n356\n00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.920\nAnd I'm gonna let that start to apply.\n\n357\n00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.930\nI just need to agree to the old\nlicensing agreement here.\n\n358\n00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:44.530\nMake Apple happy, make their attorneys\nhappy, and now it's gonna start doing it.\n\n359\n00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.320\nNow it's telling me here that\nit's gonna restart my computer.\n\n360\n00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.970\nI guess I can go ahead and\ndo that, I'll hit restart.\n\n361\n00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.850\nAnd it's gonna restart so we can apply it.\n\n362\n00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:53.850\nThe update was pretty small, right?\n\n363\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.770\nAnd so\nwe just saw it kind of flash by there.\n\n364\n00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.620\nIf we bring it back up,\nit shows where it's installing the update.\n\n365\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.570\nAnd so, it's doing it.\n\n366\n00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.330\nThe update itself is really not that big.\n\n367\n00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.490\nIt's already downloaded it.\n\n368\n00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.370\nIf you have auto updates turned on, it\nmight have even already done it for you.\n\n369\n00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:07.820\nMy auto updates are off.\n\n370\n00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.009\nSo i's downloading it, and\nit's going to run that, and\n\n371\n00:17:10.009 --> 00:17:11.250\nit's going to do that install.\n\n372\n00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.410\nSo there it goes and\nit's starting to do it.\n\n373\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:17.820\nThe key thing to remember here is,\nwhat is updating is the operating system.\n\n374\n00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:23.341\nSo it's updating my Yosemite OS\nfrom 10.10.2 to 10.10.5 so\n\n375\n00:17:23.341 --> 00:17:26.418\nmy software operating software is fine.\n\n376\n00:17:26.418 --> 00:17:28.710\nBut let's talk about hardware for\na second.\n\n377\n00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.980\nI've got a Mac Mini, and\nthe Mac Mini is a late 2014 model.\n\n378\n00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:37.590\nWell, we're filming this in 2016 so\nit's been two years.\n\n379\n00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:41.450\nWell, sometimes the hardware has problems.\n\n380\n00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.020\nAnd Apple has to patch\nto fix that hardware.\n\n381\n00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.720\nAnd if there's a problem with the\nhardware, when I go to upgrade to a new\n\n382\n00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.510\nOS, there could be a problem in\nthe upgrade and I could lose data.\n\n383\n00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.760\nI don't want that.\n\n384\n00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.270\nSo if there's been any\nproblems with the hardware,\n\n385\n00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.990\nI need to make sure I get those fixed.\n\n386\n00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.040\nThe way we get them\nfixed is by downloading\n\n387\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.630\nwhat's called a firmware update.\n\n388\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.010\nSoftware, those are programs\nyou run on our computer.\n\n389\n00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.290\nThose are easy, right?\nThis is the [INAUDIBLE] I'm\n\n390\n00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.626\ndoing in the background here.\n\n391\n00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:07.870\nBut firmware, that's the hardware.\n\n392\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:12.320\nWe're talking about processor,\nmemory, motherboard, disc controller,\n\n393\n00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.650\nnetwork adapter.\n\n394\n00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.470\nThose are all things that are built\ninto the system that we can't\n\n395\n00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.930\nnormally mess with.\n\n396\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.630\nWell, Apple releases firmware updates for\nthose too, and so\n\n397\n00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:22.580\nwe need to go and get them.\n\n398\n00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:27.700\nBut the thing is, Apple does not do\nfirmware updates through the app store.\n\n399\n00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.330\nThe app store and\n\n400\n00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.190\nthe automatic updates, those are just\nsoftware updates, not hardware.\n\n401\n00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.300\nSo if I'm gonna upgrade my system,\nI don't have to do it, but\n\n402\n00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.270\nit's really recommended that I\nupgrade my firmware first, right?\n\n403\n00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.990\nSo I need to go and\nfind out if there's a firmware update.\n\n404\n00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.790\nAnd the way we do that is by\ngoing to Apple's website.\n\n405\n00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.970\nAnd on Apple's website we can go, and\nwe can download that firmware update, and\n\n406\n00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.520\nget it loaded for\nour system and put in place.\n\n407\n00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.020\nSo on Apple's website,\nwe can browse to their site and\n\n408\n00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.130\nthe address that we wanna go to is,\nlet's see.\n\n409\n00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:03.988\nIt is support.apple.com/downloads, right?\n\n410\n00:19:03.988 --> 00:19:06.650\nAnd when we go to that site,\nwhat you're gonna see.\n\n411\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.468\nWell, you might see this.\n\n412\n00:19:08.468 --> 00:19:09.350\nThere we go.\nAll right.\n\n413\n00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.750\n[LAUGH] It just takes a second to load.\n\n414\n00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.810\nIs you're gonna see this page that\nshows us featured downloads, and\n\n415\n00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:18.540\nyou'll see downloads for\nXerox printers and OS X Snow Leopard, and\n\n416\n00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.100\njust all sorts of crazy\nthings when you come here.\n\n417\n00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.980\nSo we've gotta filter this to find\ninformation about our device, right?\n\n418\n00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.650\nAnd what I had over here\non my other system,\n\n419\n00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:32.005\nwas a Mac mini,\nthat was a late 2014 model, right?\n\n420\n00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:35.760\nSo I'm gonna go up here\nto browse by product, and\n\n421\n00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.620\nunder browse by product,\nyou can browse and try and find it.\n\n422\n00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:43.820\nSo I could come in here and I could find,\nI just went right past it, Mac desktops.\n\n423\n00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.740\nAnd when I find Mac Desktops,\nI could click on that.\n\n424\n00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.660\nAnd it's starting to filters things and\nwe start to find out information.\n\n425\n00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.010\nActually, it didn't seem to find anything,\ndid it?\n\n426\n00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.200\nSo I'm just going to use the search.\n\n427\n00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.760\nThe search seems to work a little better.\n\n428\n00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.380\nSo I'm going to say a Mac mini late 2014.\n\n429\n00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.030\nAll right.\n\n430\n00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:05.680\nAnd that's going to filter it to show me\nupdates that are just for that Mac mini.\n\n431\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.130\nAs I look at it, I'll see Boot Camp.\n\n432\n00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.190\nThat's always really popular and\nthat will turn up.\n\n433\n00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:13.090\nI've got OS X Mountain Lion\n10.8.2 update for\n\n434\n00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.540\nthe 13'' Macbook Pro with Retina Display.\n\n435\n00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.360\nThat's not a Mac mini but\nsee how it's got a comma.\n\n436\n00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.960\nThere's probably more to it and\nincludes a Mac mini.\n\n437\n00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.230\nThat's not what I need though.\n\n438\n00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:24.490\nBut what I care about are all\nthese firmware updates.\n\n439\n00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:30.650\nSee how there's firmware update 1.6,\nor firmware update 1.1, 1.7.\n\n440\n00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.320\nThese are all firmware updates for\nmy hardware.\n\n441\n00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:39.260\nAnd the newest one is this guy right here,\nMac mini EFI Firmware Update v1.8.\n\n442\n00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.790\nAnd if I click on that, it's gonna\ntake me to it and it will say here,\n\n443\n00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.820\nthis update is recommended for\nMac mini (late 2012) models.\n\n444\n00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.590\nWell, I'm a late 2014 so\nthat one doesn't really apply to me.\n\n445\n00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.160\nThis update address is an issue that may\nprevent USB keyboard from being recognized\n\n446\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.830\nafter the system waits for sleep.\n\n447\n00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.460\nWell, that could be a problem if\nI'm trying to do an upgrade or\n\n448\n00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.520\nmaybe there's some cord that interferes.\n\n449\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.860\nBut as it stands,\nthat one doesn't really apply to mine.\n\n450\n00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.200\nI've got a late 2014 model, so it's newer.\n\n451\n00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.350\nBut you see where,\n\n452\n00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:12.260\nif I have the older one,\nthat I'll need to do this firmware update.\n\n453\n00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.650\nAnd firmware updates are very\nsimilar to software updates.\n\n454\n00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.939\nYou download them, you run them, it'll\nreboot your Mac, it'll apply the update,\n\n455\n00:21:17.939 --> 00:21:19.141\nand now you're taken care of.\n\n456\n00:21:19.141 --> 00:21:21.583\nAll right.\nSo we got update our operating system, and\n\n457\n00:21:21.583 --> 00:21:23.410\nwe've gotta update our hardware.\n\n458\n00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.480\nDo these firmware updates and\nthat's gonna get that taken care of.\n\n459\n00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.390\nAll right, so that systems re-booting\nnow and it's gonna be, hopefully,\n\n460\n00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.510\nrunning 10.10.5, the latest update for\n\n461\n00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.230\nYosemite, which means I'm ready to upgrade\nand I've done my firmware updates.\n\n462\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.710\nSo now we're ready to go there.\n\n463\n00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:40.510\nThe last thing that we needed to do is get\nour Yosemite installer to do the install.\n\n464\n00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.450\nWell, I say the last thing,\nI kind of skipped the whole back up part.\n\n465\n00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.250\nRight?\nYou want to make\n\n466\n00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.570\nsure take a time machine back up.\n\n467\n00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.060\nYou back up your data just in\ncase something goes wrong.\n\n468\n00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.180\nNow, my machine doesn't\nreally have much data on it.\n\n469\n00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.800\nSo, I'm not so\nworry about losing anything.\n\n470\n00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.088\nSo, I'll skip the back up but\ndon't tell Apple.\n\n471\n00:21:53.088 --> 00:21:56.080\n[LAUGH] So then, we're just gonna go and\nget this thing ready.\n\n472\n00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.108\nSo it's booted up.\nLet's just make sure that it is all\n\n473\n00:21:58.108 --> 00:21:58.990\ngood to go.\n\n474\n00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.350\nSo I'm gonna jump up here into my, about\nthis Mac screen like we did a few minutes\n\n475\n00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:06.490\nago, and what I'm expecting to see is if I\nlook in here that it now version 10.10.5\n\n476\n00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:12.200\nso I am updated to the latest and\ngreatest, I'm ready to upgrade, all right?\n\n477\n00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.250\nSo the next thing I need to do is I\nneed to get the OS 10 installer, right?\n\n478\n00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:17.008\nAnd where do we get it?\n\n479\n00:22:17.008 --> 00:22:21.560\nWell, there's really one place to go and\nget it, and that's the app store.\n\n480\n00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.360\nWe know the app store and\nwe can download and install it.\n\n481\n00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.350\nNow, you don't have to download it\n\n482\n00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.590\non the same machine that\nyou're going to install it on.\n\n483\n00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:32.230\nSo we could have downloaded on another\nmachine and brought it over here.\n\n484\n00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:36.910\nYou can download the El Capitan installer\non any machine running OS 10.7 or\n\n485\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:37.977\nhigher, right.\n\n486\n00:22:37.977 --> 00:22:40.210\nSo [INAUDIBLE] 10.7.\n\n487\n00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:45.440\nRemember I said we can install it on\n10.6`8 but it won't see the installer,\n\n488\n00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.080\nso it's got to be 10.7 or\nhigher for me to see the installer.\n\n489\n00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.580\nAnd then I can download it and\nget it available.\n\n490\n00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.560\nSo if you wanna download it,\nhere's the way it works.\n\n491\n00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:56.030\nYou jump into your app store, and\nin the app store, right under updates,\n\n492\n00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.430\nit was telling me all about Yosemite,\nright?\n\n493\n00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.150\nSo when I jumped onto that update screen,\n\n494\n00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.970\nit had the nice big giant banner\nthat will come up any minute now.\n\n495\n00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.060\nIt is promoting for\nme to upgrade the Yosemite, right?\n\n496\n00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:10.510\nNow, if I choose to install,\neventually we'll, there we go.\n\n497\n00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:14.020\nAll right, if I choose to install,\nit's gonna try and\n\n498\n00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.420\ninstall on this machine, right?\n\n499\n00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.190\nOr we might not wanna install it.\n\n500\n00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.850\nMaybe I just wanna download it on this\nmachine and then take it to other\n\n501\n00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.910\nmachines, since I have machines that\ndon't have internet connectivity, right?\n\n502\n00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.690\nSo I take this machine and I download it.\n\n503\n00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:29.730\nSo what we do is once\nit shows that update,\n\n504\n00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.440\nwe'll be able to download it and\nget it in place.\n\n505\n00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.065\nIt looks like I missed some updates, too.\n\n506\n00:23:34.065 --> 00:23:36.420\nIt's always a good thing is to come\nback and double check that, but\n\n507\n00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.050\nit seems to have applied\nsome that are in place.\n\n508\n00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.760\nBut it is saying there's another,\na remote desktop client update.\n\n509\n00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.933\nThat's not gonna stop my upgrade, so\nI'm not gonna worry about that one.\n\n510\n00:23:43.933 --> 00:23:44.560\nAll right.\n\n511\n00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.086\nBut I do have this little button\nover here for El Capitan, and\n\n512\n00:23:48.086 --> 00:23:51.266\nsee how mine says,\nit's really hard to see there, but\n\n513\n00:23:51.266 --> 00:23:54.952\nit actually says Downloaded I\nhaven't downloaded the thing.\n\n514\n00:23:54.952 --> 00:23:58.850\nBut on my account,\nI've downloaded on other machines.\n\n515\n00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.640\nSo if I wanna get this thing and\nget it installed and\n\n516\n00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.810\ndownloaded I just need to do a search for\nEl Capitan.\n\n517\n00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:08.480\nAnd it's gonna look and\nfind that application, there it is.\n\n518\n00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.850\nAnd I can choose to Download it.\n\n519\n00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:14.685\nNow, when I finish the download,\nit's gonna download it to this machine and\n\n520\n00:24:14.685 --> 00:24:16.458\nthen it's gonna try to install it.\n\n521\n00:24:16.458 --> 00:24:19.678\nAll you have to do is hit Cancel,\nand if you hit Cancel,\n\n522\n00:24:19.678 --> 00:24:22.486\nyou'll have the OS X installer for\nEl Capitan.\n\n523\n00:24:22.486 --> 00:24:26.373\nThe 10.11 installer, and you can take\nthe installer and you can copy it, and\n\n524\n00:24:26.373 --> 00:24:28.020\nsend it to other machines.\n\n525\n00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.933\nIf I hit Download here,\nit's about 6 gigs in size.\n\n526\n00:24:29.933 --> 00:24:32.570\nSo I'd have to wait for\nit download 6 gigs in files.\n\n527\n00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.880\nI'm not gonna do that, that's too long.\n\n528\n00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.163\nSo when it finishes installing\nthough you'll know it,\n\n529\n00:24:37.163 --> 00:24:39.310\ncuz it's right there on\nyour Macintosh hard drive.\n\n530\n00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:43.710\nSo if I browse into my hard drive and\nI go into my Applications folder.\n\n531\n00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:48.421\nYou'll have an application here\ncalled install OS X El Capitan.\n\n532\n00:24:48.421 --> 00:24:50.734\nAnd you might even have some old ones,\n\n533\n00:24:50.734 --> 00:24:54.362\nif you're upgraded a few times\nInstall OS 10 Mavericks.\n\n534\n00:24:54.362 --> 00:24:56.390\nIt's fine if you have more\nthan one sitting there.\n\n535\n00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:57.410\nThe one we want is El Capitan.\n\n536\n00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.722\nNow, I don't have it because\nI didn't download it, but\n\n537\n00:25:00.722 --> 00:25:02.523\nI did download it on my laptop.\n\n538\n00:25:02.523 --> 00:25:06.376\nSo I've got it over here on this extra\nhard drive, and I'm just gonna take it and\n\n539\n00:25:06.376 --> 00:25:08.630\ndrag it and\ndrop it right into my application.\n\n540\n00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:12.833\nSo you can download it from the App Store\nor you can copy it from another machine,\n\n541\n00:25:12.833 --> 00:25:14.420\nand that's what I like to do.\n\n542\n00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.813\nI always keep backups of these on external\ndrives just in case I ever need them.\n\n543\n00:25:17.813 --> 00:25:21.080\nYou might want an older OS, and\nyou can always go and get it that way too.\n\n544\n00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.550\nIn fact, while we're speaking of that,\nif you want an older OS.\n\n545\n00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:26.552\nWhen you go into the App Store,\n\n546\n00:25:26.552 --> 00:25:31.570\nit's gonna just show newer OS the El\nCapitan and it's gonna show by default.\n\n547\n00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:32.740\nAnd if I come in here and I search,\n\n548\n00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.350\nlike maybe I wanna download\nthe Yosemite installer.\n\n549\n00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:38.314\nWell when I search for\nthe Yosemite installer.\n\n550\n00:25:38.314 --> 00:25:41.290\nWell it's not gonna find it,\nt's not there.\n\n551\n00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.541\nSo when a newer version comes out,\nit replaces the older version.\n\n552\n00:25:44.541 --> 00:25:45.770\nIf you ever need the old version.\n\n553\n00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.197\nSo whatever is after El Capitan comes out,\nbut\n\n554\n00:25:48.197 --> 00:25:51.630\nyou still need to download\nthe El Capitan installer.\n\n555\n00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:55.159\nWhat you can do is go into your Purchased\nhistory, and it'll show up in your\n\n556\n00:25:55.159 --> 00:25:58.421\nPurchased history and so here we can\nlook at this stuff that I bought.\n\n557\n00:25:58.421 --> 00:26:01.076\nSo we can jump in here and\nlook at my Purchased history and\n\n558\n00:26:01.076 --> 00:26:04.610\nas you scroll around,\nthere's the Mavericks installer.\n\n559\n00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.760\nMavericks is old now,\nI don't want it but if I need it for\n\n560\n00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.640\nsome reason I can download it right there.\n\n561\n00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.379\nAnd Yosemite would show up this way and\nEl Capitan and\n\n562\n00:26:13.379 --> 00:26:15.378\nso on, they would all show up in here.\n\n563\n00:26:15.378 --> 00:26:17.480\nAnd you can go and\ndownload those ones that you need.\n\n564\n00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.166\nSo you can always get\naccess to the old ones.\n\n565\n00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:25.690\nBut once we've got it, now it's\ncopied into my Applications folder.\n\n566\n00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.480\nAnd so it's sitting right here,\nand I could double-click that and\n\n567\n00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.150\nlaunch the install.\n\n568\n00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:31.291\nThat's one way.\n\n569\n00:26:31.291 --> 00:26:34.114\nI can download to the App Store or\ntwo ways,\n\n570\n00:26:34.114 --> 00:26:37.259\nI can copy the installer\nfrom another machine.\n\n571\n00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:39.360\nBut there's actually a third\nway that's worth mentioning.\n\n572\n00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.929\nI could just double-click on this and\n\n573\n00:26:40.929 --> 00:26:43.410\nit's gonna install the update\nright on this machine.\n\n574\n00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.087\nI can do that because I'm\nalready running OS X.\n\n575\n00:26:46.087 --> 00:26:47.670\nWhat if I'm not?\n\n576\n00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.950\nWhat if I had a hard drive failure and\nI had to put a new hard drive in here,\n\n577\n00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.280\nand it's completely bank.\n\n578\n00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.394\nIt's kind of hard to go to your\nApp Store and hit Download,\n\n579\n00:26:54.394 --> 00:26:55.960\nwhen your hard drive is completely blank.\n\n580\n00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.306\nYou can't even boot up.\n\n581\n00:26:57.306 --> 00:27:02.311\nAnd so the third option I wanna talk\nabout is creating a USB installer.\n\n582\n00:27:02.311 --> 00:27:05.770\nYou can take a USB key,\nI look around blindly for mine.\n\n583\n00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:08.430\nYou can take a little USB key like this.\n\n584\n00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.341\nAnd you can put the OS X\ninstaller on there, but\n\n585\n00:27:10.341 --> 00:27:12.110\nit's not just a matter of copying it over.\n\n586\n00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.564\nThere's actually some\nspecial steps we have to go,\n\n587\n00:27:14.564 --> 00:27:17.352\nbecause what you're gonna do\nis create a bootable USB key,\n\n588\n00:27:17.352 --> 00:27:20.720\nsomething you can boot the computer\noff of to do the installation from.\n\n589\n00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.136\nAnd once you do that, you've got a USB\nkey that you can take to any computer.\n\n590\n00:27:25.136 --> 00:27:27.783\nBoot off of the key,\nand install El Capitan.\n\n591\n00:27:27.783 --> 00:27:29.526\nSo I don't have to have\naccess to the App Store,\n\n592\n00:27:29.526 --> 00:27:32.413\nI don't have to have Internet access,\nI don't have to have any of that stuff.\n\n593\n00:27:32.413 --> 00:27:34.851\nI can install right from the key.\n\n594\n00:27:34.851 --> 00:27:38.940\nFirst off you need a key with\nat least 8 gigs of storage.\n\n595\n00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.830\nSo you want 8 gigs or more,\nthe installer itself is 6 gigs.\n\n596\n00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.130\nSo if you have a 4 gigs stick,\n\n597\n00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.550\nit's not even gonna be big enough for\nthe installer.\n\n598\n00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:49.580\nSo you need at least 8 gigs\nof memory on your USB key.\n\n599\n00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.320\nSecondly, it doesn't have to be a USB key.\n\n600\n00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.420\nI usually use this little SSD drive\nthat I've got here, because it's faster.\n\n601\n00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.480\nThis is a USB 3.0 key and\nthat's great, but\n\n602\n00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.680\nthe flash memory that's in\nthese keys is not very good.\n\n603\n00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:05.430\nI got an SSD that has very good flash\nmemory and I can hook it up via USB 3,\n\n604\n00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:09.290\nand we can get some good speed at it,\nthe installation will be faster.\n\n605\n00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.299\nSo you can use your own\nremovable hard drive or USB key.\n\n606\n00:28:12.299 --> 00:28:14.735\nThe key thing is when\nwe build the installer,\n\n607\n00:28:14.735 --> 00:28:17.120\nit's going to erase whatever you use.\n\n608\n00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.040\nSo whatever you use,\n\n609\n00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.480\nthere's gotta be something you\ndon't have important data on.\n\n610\n00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.546\nSo this USB key, I don't care about what's\non it, I can erase it and that's fine.\n\n611\n00:28:24.546 --> 00:28:27.260\nOr my SSD drive here, I don't care\nabout what's on it I can erase it and\n\n612\n00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.220\nthat's fine.\n\n613\n00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.010\nBut if you've got like\na time machine disk and\n\n614\n00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:33.000\nyou wanna use that,\nyou're about to lose all of your back-ups.\n\n615\n00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.920\nSo make sure it's a disk with\nnothing on it that you care about.\n\n616\n00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.640\nAnd then,\nwe can build the bootable installer,\n\n617\n00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.530\nwell let me show you how that works.\n\n618\n00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.875\nSo basically, first off you need to\ndownload the El Capitan installer, and\n\n619\n00:28:43.875 --> 00:28:46.083\nagain it doesn't have to\nbe on the target system.\n\n620\n00:28:46.083 --> 00:28:49.028\nRemember the target system has a bad\nhard drive, it's a blank hard drive,\n\n621\n00:28:49.028 --> 00:28:50.220\nI can't boot it up.\n\n622\n00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.082\nSo I need to go to somebody\nelse's Mac somewhere else or\n\n623\n00:28:53.082 --> 00:28:55.457\nwhat I recommend is make\nthese ahead of time.\n\n624\n00:28:55.457 --> 00:28:57.250\nDon't wait for a problem to occur.\n\n625\n00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:00.150\nMake it ahead of time, so\nyou've got it when you need it.\n\n626\n00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:04.826\nSo go to some machine somewhere\nthat's running Mac OS 10.7 or\n\n627\n00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:08.040\nhigher and\ndownload the El Capital installer.\n\n628\n00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.930\nAnd once it's downloaded you can pop\nin some removable media like mine.\n\n629\n00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:17.530\nI've got this external SSD right here, and\nthen we can build a bootable installer.\n\n630\n00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:19.921\nSo I'm gonna build it.\nNow, I need to check this to make\n\n631\n00:29:19.921 --> 00:29:21.470\nsure there's nothing on here I care about.\n\n632\n00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.146\nAnd well, there's the OS X installer,\nbut I don't know.\n\n633\n00:29:24.146 --> 00:29:26.140\nI don't really care about that.\n\n634\n00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.260\nIn fact, just to be fair here,\n\n635\n00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:32.580\nI'm gonna format to make sure that there\nisn't anything on here that I care about.\n\n636\n00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.891\nSo let me get into my Disk Utility, and\n\n637\n00:29:34.891 --> 00:29:38.297\nI'm just gonna take that drive and\nI'm gonna erase it.\n\n638\n00:29:38.297 --> 00:29:41.431\nSo when we erase it, that will make\nsure there's nothing on there.\n\n639\n00:29:41.431 --> 00:29:44.460\nI'll just leave to call it untitled,\nand there we go.\n\n640\n00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.599\nSo that's gonna erase that drive.\n\n641\n00:29:45.599 --> 00:29:50.062\nIt's gonna have absolutely nothing on it,\nI don't wanna use it for\n\n642\n00:29:50.062 --> 00:29:52.107\ntime machine, so there we go.\n\n643\n00:29:52.107 --> 00:29:55.640\nSo now, I'm gonna turn that\ndisc into a bootable installer.\n\n644\n00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.260\nI erased it just for fun there,\nyou don't have to erase it.\n\n645\n00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.110\nI just wanted to show you guys and\nI'm coming from blank media.\n\n646\n00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.603\nIf I don't erase it,\nthe installer's gonna erase it for me.\n\n647\n00:30:04.603 --> 00:30:07.844\nSo one way or another,\nit's going to get erased.\n\n648\n00:30:07.844 --> 00:30:11.537\nSo I'm gonna jump into my terminal and\nin the terminal,\n\n649\n00:30:11.537 --> 00:30:14.769\nwe have a really long\ncommand that we need to run.\n\n650\n00:30:14.769 --> 00:30:18.360\nSo let me make this nice and\nbig, so we'll be able to see it.\n\n651\n00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.040\nAnd then we're gonna run this nice\nlong command that's gonna help us to\n\n652\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.550\nbuild that installer.\n\n653\n00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.730\nAnd that command works like this.\n\n654\n00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.410\nFirst off, we need to be\nan administrator to run this.\n\n655\n00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.430\nSo I'm gonna use these sudo command.\n\n656\n00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:33.213\nIf you ever used sudo, normally\nwhen you run a command like whoami.\n\n657\n00:30:33.213 --> 00:30:34.490\nThat's gonna say who I am.\n\n658\n00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:36.503\nHey, I'm D Pezet, that's my user.\n\n659\n00:30:36.503 --> 00:30:39.744\nBut if I ran sudo whoami.\n\n660\n00:30:39.744 --> 00:30:42.978\nit's gonna run as the super user,\nas an administrator.\n\n661\n00:30:42.978 --> 00:30:46.690\nAnd so you'll have to provide a password,\nand then it will show who it's running as.\n\n662\n00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:51.761\nSee how it's running as root now,\nso when I run whoami it's just me,\n\n663\n00:30:51.761 --> 00:30:54.920\nbut when I run sudo whoami, I'm not root.\n\n664\n00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.823\nThe first time I sudo something\nit requires a password, and\n\n665\n00:30:57.823 --> 00:30:59.950\nthen after that a timer starts.\n\n666\n00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:03.529\nAnd if I don't use it for, I believe it's\nfive minutes, then it's gonna ask for\n\n667\n00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:05.860\na password again, so\nI've got a limited time here.\n\n668\n00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:11.270\nSo I'm gonna do sudo and\nthen I'm gonna specify the installer.\n\n669\n00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:17.335\nSo I'm gonna say, /Applications\n/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Captain.app/.\n\n670\n00:31:17.335 --> 00:31:19.076\nAnd I'm using tab auto complete on this,\n\n671\n00:31:19.076 --> 00:31:22.960\nI'm doing that on purpose cuz these are\nreally long and I don't wanna type them.\n\n672\n00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.745\nBut also anywhere you have a space,\n\n673\n00:31:24.745 --> 00:31:27.076\nyou have to do a backslash\nto escape the space.\n\n674\n00:31:27.076 --> 00:31:30.468\nSo it knows that it continues on and\nit's kind of annoying to do that,\n\n675\n00:31:30.468 --> 00:31:33.463\nif you do the tab auto complete,\nit'll fill that in for you.\n\n676\n00:31:33.463 --> 00:31:35.931\nSo I'm gonna point this at El Capitan, and\n\n677\n00:31:35.931 --> 00:31:38.870\nthen I need to point to\na file that's inside of it.\n\n678\n00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:40.270\nThe script I'm looking for\nis inside of that.\n\n679\n00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:45.302\nSo I've gotta go into the contents\nfolder and the Resources folder.\n\n680\n00:31:45.302 --> 00:31:48.405\nAnd it's gonna screen wrap on me\njust cuz the command is really long.\n\n681\n00:31:48.405 --> 00:31:50.303\nBut you guys can kinda\nsee the whole thing,\n\n682\n00:31:50.303 --> 00:31:52.315\nI'll just move it over a little bit,\nthere.\n\n683\n00:31:52.315 --> 00:31:56.655\nAll right, so going to the Resources\nfolder, and it's in that Resources\n\n684\n00:31:56.655 --> 00:32:00.720\nfolder that there's a little\nprogram called createinstallmedia.\n\n685\n00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:06.590\nNow technically, I could have browsed\nthrough the GUI to get to this and run it.\n\n686\n00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.928\nBut the reason I'm running it from\nterminal is there's some command line\n\n687\n00:32:08.928 --> 00:32:10.320\narguments that I have to provide.\n\n688\n00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.970\nFor example, I have to tell it where\nI want the install media to be.\n\n689\n00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.710\nSo I'm going to say --volume and\nthe name of the volume.\n\n690\n00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:20.180\nWell, I just formatted mine so\nit's called Untitled, right?\n\n691\n00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.550\nSo you've gotta make it whatever yours is.\n\n692\n00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:25.536\nMine use to be called external SSD and\nso I would put that in there, but\n\n693\n00:32:25.536 --> 00:32:28.940\nnow it's called Untitled so\nthat's what I'll put in, all right?\n\n694\n00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.719\nAnd I can't just type\nUntitled like I'm doing here,\n\n695\n00:32:31.719 --> 00:32:35.573\nI actually I have to get a path too,\nwhich for me is /Volumes/Untitled.\n\n696\n00:32:35.573 --> 00:32:39.091\nYours will be /Volumes/whatever\nthe name of your drive is, all right.\n\n697\n00:32:39.091 --> 00:32:43.750\nThen [LAUGH] this is kind of weird, but\nI have to tell it where the installer is.\n\n698\n00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.070\nI'm running the script.\n\n699\n00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.750\nYou'd think the script would\nknow where the installer is,\n\n700\n00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.930\nsince the script is in the installer.\n\n701\n00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.577\nBut it's possible that I've moved\nthe script somewhere else so\n\n702\n00:32:52.577 --> 00:32:56.840\nI have to say --applicationpath,\nright, and did I spell that right?\n\n703\n00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.310\napplicationpath, yes, and\nthen tell it where that installer is.\n\n704\n00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:04.010\nAnd so I've got to say, //applications,\nor sorry, just one slash.\n\n705\n00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:10.884\napplications, and then /Install\n[LAUGH] typing is my challenge,\n\n706\n00:33:10.884 --> 00:33:17.280\nthere we go,\nInstall\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app, right.\n\n707\n00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.687\nAnd then the last thing\nthat I need to provide,\n\n708\n00:33:19.687 --> 00:33:22.690\nthis is kind of an optional one is,\n--nointeraction.\n\n709\n00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:24.504\nAnd what nointeraction does is just says,\nhey,\n\n710\n00:33:24.504 --> 00:33:26.074\ndon't ask my any questions, just do it.\n\n711\n00:33:26.074 --> 00:33:27.550\nOtherwise it's gonna\nask me questions like,\n\n712\n00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.630\nare you sure you want to erase this media.\n\n713\n00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:31.090\nI don't care, let's erase it, let's do it.\n\n714\n00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:36.030\nAll right, when I run that command right\nthere, it's gonna format my drive, so\n\n715\n00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:37.290\nthere it goes, erasing.\n\n716\n00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.604\nSo it just erased my storage.\n\n717\n00:33:39.604 --> 00:33:42.582\nAnd you'll see in the background there,\nif you look,\n\n718\n00:33:42.582 --> 00:33:44.800\nhow it isn't called Untitled anymore.\n\n719\n00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.726\nNow it's called Install OS X El Capitan,\nright?\n\n720\n00:33:47.726 --> 00:33:50.648\nSo it's renamed it and it's actually\nasking if I want to use it for\n\n721\n00:33:50.648 --> 00:33:52.573\nTime Machine, I'm gonna say don't use.\n\n722\n00:33:52.573 --> 00:33:57.900\nAnd now it's copying all\nthe installation files to that disk.\n\n723\n00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.680\nAnd once the installation\nfiles are copied over,\n\n724\n00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.270\nit then does what's called\nblessing the drive.\n\n725\n00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.290\nAnd blessing the drive,\nthat's where it makes it bootable.\n\n726\n00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:09.570\nSo that I'll be able to attach\nthis disk to a computer,\n\n727\n00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:15.300\nI'll be able to boot off of this disk and\ninstall OS 10, El Capitan, all right.\n\n728\n00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:19.590\nSo if my system is up and healthy,\nthe easiest way to install it is\n\n729\n00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:23.720\njust go to the App Store,\ndo the install, and you're done, right.\n\n730\n00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.840\nBut if the system is not healthy,\nif I want to format it and start fresh and\n\n731\n00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:32.220\nclean, then the best thing to do is\nto create removable media like this.\n\n732\n00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:35.190\nI can boot off the media,\ndo the install and I'll be in business.\n\n733\n00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.230\nAnd the best part here is,\nonce I've got this removable media,\n\n734\n00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:38.860\nI can use it over and over and over again.\n\n735\n00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:43.070\nI can do this on 20 computers or\nwhatever and get it done, all right.\n\n736\n00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:46.640\nNow for me, it built that\nremovable media pretty fast, but\n\n737\n00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.260\nthat's because I'm using an external\nSSD on USB 3 and it's fast.\n\n738\n00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:54.061\nWhen you build a USB key, it could take 10\nminutes sometimes, it can take 20 minutes,\n\n739\n00:34:54.061 --> 00:34:57.276\njust depends on how fast that USB key is\nso you may see it takes longer for you.\n\n740\n00:34:57.276 --> 00:35:01.400\nBut once it's done,\nI've now got an installation media, right.\n\n741\n00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.826\nAnd I can jump in, boot a system from\nthis, and do my install, all right.\n\n742\n00:35:05.826 --> 00:35:11.260\nSo let's rehash the four steps that Apple\ntold us that we needed to do, right.\n\n743\n00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.108\nFirst, update our operating system.\n\n744\n00:35:13.108 --> 00:35:16.076\nWe did that, we went to the App Store,\nwe checked for updates,\n\n745\n00:35:16.076 --> 00:35:17.620\nwe updated to 10.10.5.\n\n746\n00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.184\nSecond, update our hardware.\n\n747\n00:35:20.184 --> 00:35:22.642\nWe need to go and look for\nfirmware updates on Apple's website and\n\n748\n00:35:22.642 --> 00:35:23.630\napply them if necessary.\n\n749\n00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.807\nWe didn't have any, so\nI didn't have to worry about it there.\n\n750\n00:35:25.807 --> 00:35:27.458\nThird, back up your data.\n\n751\n00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:30.630\nRun a Time Machine backup,\nback up your information and get it.\n\n752\n00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:33.680\nAnd then lastly,\ndocument your settings, right.\n\n753\n00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.440\nAny customization I've done to the user\ninterface that might get changed\n\n754\n00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.220\nby install of El Capitan,\nI might need to put back, so\n\n755\n00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.380\nI want to have those documented and\nwritten down.\n\n756\n00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:44.679\nOnce all that's done,\nnow we're ready to install, right.\n\n757\n00:35:44.679 --> 00:35:47.181\nWe've got our installation media,\nour system's ready,\n\n758\n00:35:47.181 --> 00:35:48.448\nit's time to do the install.\n\n759\n00:35:48.448 --> 00:35:52.480\nBut I've jabbered on enough that we've\nactually run out of time in this episode.\n\n760\n00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.380\nSo we're going to take a look at\nthe install in the next episode.\n\n761\n00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.310\nBut right here you guys have seen\nwhat it takes to get prepared and\n\n762\n00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:01.830\nget to that point to where we're\nnow ready to install El Capitan.\n\n763\n00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:04.430\n>> Very good, a lot of good\ninformation on the preparation so\n\n764\n00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.060\nthat you can install\nEl Capitan on your devices.\n\n765\n00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.015\nDon, got anything else for\nus on this this episode?\n\n766\n00:36:09.015 --> 00:36:09.725\n>> That's about it on this one.\n\n767\n00:36:09.725 --> 00:36:12.745\nDefinitely stay tuned cuz we're gonna keep\ngoing on with this in the next episode.\n\n768\n00:36:12.745 --> 00:36:15.645\n>> All right, well it looks like we've\ncome to the end of another great episode.\n\n769\n00:36:15.645 --> 00:36:18.985\nSo I'm going to go ahead and sign off for\nITProTV, I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n770\n00:36:18.985 --> 00:36:20.025\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n771\n00:36:20.025 --> 00:36:22.403\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n772\n00:36:22.403 --> 00:36:29.990\n[SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:16.135\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:19.405\nAnd in today's episode we're gonna\nbe moving through our series in\n\n5\n00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:21.405\nApple certified support professional.\n\n6\n00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:23.885\nWe've got none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet to help us out.\n\n7\n00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:24.755\nDon, how are you doing sir?\n\n8\n00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:25.835\n>> I'm doing great Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:29.475\nI'm ready to jump right back in to the\nworld of Mac OS and in our last episode,\n\n10\n00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:33.200\nif you guys watch them all,\nwe talked about installing Mac OS.\n\n11\n00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.120\nIt was a good time.\n\n12\n00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.290\nBut we never actually installed it.\n\n13\n00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.420\nWe did all the preparation steps\nto get ready to install OS 10,\n\n14\n00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.860\nand in this episode we're\nactually gonna make it happen.\n\n15\n00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.790\nSo that's where we're\ngonna kick this one off.\n\n16\n00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.630\nWe've already verified that our machine\nis capable of running El Capitan, so\n\n17\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.100\nOS X10.11.\n\n18\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.260\nDepends on how you wanna say it.\n\n19\n00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.000\nBut basically we know\nwe're okay to run it.\n\n20\n00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.520\nWe need to install it and in the last\nepisode, we made installation media so\n\n21\n00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.090\nI've got this removable hard drive\nhere that has the installer on it,\n\n22\n00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.250\nit's ready to go,\nI'm ready to do my install.\n\n23\n00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.910\nBut I do want to mention one thing before\nI dive into the whole installation\n\n24\n00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.830\nprocess, which is I don't\nnecessarily need this drive.\n\n25\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.070\nIf my computer is up and\nrunning and happy,\n\n26\n00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.710\nlike the computer that I've got here,\nit's a Mac Mini, it's running OS X, or\n\n27\n00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.240\nOS 10.10, and that's Yosemite, so\n\n28\n00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.790\nit's office happy, I could just\nrun the installer right from it.\n\n29\n00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.690\nAnd that would start the installation,\nand start the upgrade, and\n\n30\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.890\nmove me from Template 10 To 10.11 right?\n\n31\n00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.680\nLet me show you here on the machine so\nif we take a look at this.\n\n32\n00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.450\nSo I've just got my\nregular old Mac mini here.\n\n33\n00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.570\nI've got the nice little\nYosemite wallpaper so\n\n34\n00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.000\nI know what version I'm running.\n\n35\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.210\nYou probably shouldn't base your\nversion numbers off of your wallpaper\n\n36\n00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.330\ncuz anybody can change that but\nI am running Yosemite.\n\n37\n00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.230\nAnd if I wanna upgrade to el Capitan\nthe install can be super simple right?\n\n38\n00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.400\nAnd this could be the shortest\nepisode on the planet if we do it\n\n39\n00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.820\nthe super simple way.\n\n40\n00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.950\nIf I browse into my Macintosh hard drive\nand I browse into applications inside\n\n41\n00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.040\nof my applications in the last episode\nwe downloaded this guy right here right?\n\n42\n00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.730\nThe install OSX El Capitan,\nand we've got it.\n\n43\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.050\nAnd I can double click that, and\nit would start the installation.\n\n44\n00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.550\nMy system would reboot,\nit would copy some files and\n\n45\n00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.860\nthen when it was done it would reboot\nagain and, I'm not running El Capitan.\n\n46\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.810\nIt's that simple, right?\n\n47\n00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.910\nIf you're upgrading a fully\nfunctional system or\n\n48\n00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.910\na system that's got data on\nit that's important to you.\n\n49\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.070\nSo maybe I've got\ndocuments that are on here.\n\n50\n00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.620\nI've got programs installed\nthat are important to me.\n\n51\n00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.500\nI've got various things like that and\nI want to keep all that.\n\n52\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.260\nAn in place upgrade is the way to go.\n\n53\n00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.440\nDownload the installer from the app store,\nrun in the install.\n\n54\n00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.550\nIt'll do an in place upgrade.\n\n55\n00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.630\nWhen you're done,\nyou'll run El Capitan and\n\n56\n00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.930\nall of your software\nwill still be in tact.\n\n57\n00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.990\nThat's the easiest way to get\nEl Capitan installed But,\n\n58\n00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.360\nWhat if that's not the case?\n\n59\n00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.870\nWhat if you're not that perfect scenario\nwhere everything is goes nice and smooth?\n\n60\n00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.480\nWhat if your computer been running kinda\nslow and it's junk up with applications\n\n61\n00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.920\nyou don't want anymore or maybe you can't\neven boot the operating system is broken.\n\n62\n00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.320\nMaybe you have a failed hard drive and\nyou have to bringing on a new hard drive.\n\n63\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.630\nAnd popping the system is completely\nblank and there is no system,\n\n64\n00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.100\nno operating system.\n\n65\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.550\nWell, you can't go into your\napplications folder and\n\n66\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.050\ndouble click on that icon, can you?\n\n67\n00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.550\nSo we need to be able to\ninstall OS 10 from scratch.\n\n68\n00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.170\nRight?\n\n69\n00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.890\nAnd that's where we really need to have a\nremovable drive like this with an install.\n\n70\n00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.160\nNow, even then you don't\ntechnically have to have it.\n\n71\n00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.450\nWe're gonna see in the trouble shooting\nepisodes later on where most modern Mac's,\n\n72\n00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.520\npretty much any Mac made in the last\nthree years supports internet recovery.\n\n73\n00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.750\nI can have a blank card drive in it and\nI can boot to internet recovery and\n\n74\n00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.720\nit'll reach to Apple servers and\n\n75\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.340\ndownload the operating system\nto install in the machine.\n\n76\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.590\nAnd you can get that machine up and\nrunning entirely using the internet.\n\n77\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.060\nIt's slow but it works, right?\n\n78\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.550\nBut ideally, you'll have made a removable\nmedia somewhere that has the operating\n\n79\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.830\nsystem, and you can install from that.\n\n80\n00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.730\nIt's much faster.\n\n81\n00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.370\n>> Now Don,\nI've noticed over the last few days,\n\n82\n00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.840\nall the different Macs that you got\naround here, whether it be a laptop,\n\n83\n00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.610\nwhether it be a Mac Mini there\n>> One of the things I noticed that is not\n\n84\n00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.600\nthere is an optical drive and that almost\nseems like a legacy device that I didn't\n\n85\n00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.020\nthink I'd be saying,\noptical drive is legacy.\n\n86\n00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.120\nBut what's up with that?\n\n87\n00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.400\n>> Yeah, so back in the day,\n\n88\n00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.770\nif you bought a Mac that came with Snow\nLeopard, when you opened up the box and\n\n89\n00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.280\nyou took your brand new Mac out\n>> Down at the bottom of\n\n90\n00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.920\nthe box there was a snow leopard disk.\n\n91\n00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.540\nRight?\n\n92\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.520\nOr a leopard even.\n\n93\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.870\nBut really,\nI think it was started with Mountain Lion.\n\n94\n00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.230\nApple stopped sending out those discs and\nyou can still make them if you wanted but\n\n95\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.160\nthey didn't send out the disc's anymore.\n\n96\n00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.750\nAnd with our modern version of OS 10,\nso with Maverick's and\n\n97\n00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.340\nYosemite and El Capitan They've gotten\ntoo big to fit on a standard DVD, right?\n\n98\n00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.550\nA standard DVD, and you might have\nto help me out on this one, Wesley.\n\n99\n00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.196\nWhat is it, 4.3 gigs?\n\n100\n00:04:46.196 --> 00:04:47.092\n>> 4.7, yep.\n>> 4.7 gigs, right?\n\n101\n00:04:47.092 --> 00:04:49.080\n>> Mm-hm. Yep. >> So, 4.7 gigs of data.\n\n102\n00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.430\nBut that installer that we saw,\nit's bigger than 4.7 gigs, it won't fit.\n\n103\n00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.445\nSo you have to get a dual layer DVD,\nwhich those go, what do those go to, Wes?\n\n104\n00:04:57.445 --> 00:04:58.840\n>> 9.4, they're just doubled.\n\n105\n00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.630\nYep.\nDouble density.\n\n106\n00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.360\n>> Okay, so then\n>> So we go to 9.4 gigs.\n\n107\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.220\nThat would work if you\nhad a dual-layer DVD but\n\n108\n00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.140\ndo you have one laying around, Wes?\n\n109\n00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.750\n>> I haven't seen one in awhile.\n\n110\n00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.410\n>> Neither have I.\n\n111\n00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.490\nIt's not common.\n\n112\n00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.910\nPeople just don't have\nwritable DVDs anymore.\n\n113\n00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.520\nPeople moved to USB keys.\n\n114\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.990\nAnd that's what Apple\nwants you to do also.\n\n115\n00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.210\nSo they know people have moved to USB\nkeys, removable drives like mine.\n\n116\n00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.530\nAnd so\nthey've stopped including optical drives.\n\n117\n00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.020\nAnd Wess, you're exactly right.\n\n118\n00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.070\nYour Macbook, my Macbook,\nthis Mac Mini, my iMac at home,\n\n119\n00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.070\nnone of them have\nan optical drive on them.\n\n120\n00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.570\nEven if I had a DVD, I couldn't put\nit in there, but if I had the uplink,\n\n121\n00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.720\nif I've brought my SuperDrive.\n\n122\n00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.600\nI've got a little removable drive\n>> I can't make a bootable DVD\n\n123\n00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.430\ninstaller for El Capitan.\n\n124\n00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.270\nSo what we used to do is\nwe said pop that DVD in.\n\n125\n00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.130\nAnd when you turn your computer on, hold\nthe letter C on the keyboard which tell it\n\n126\n00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.870\nto boost from the CD drive, and\nit boost from that CD and install it.\n\n127\n00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.480\nThat's gone now, all right.\n\n128\n00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.030\nSo we're gonna move to a media,\n\n129\n00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.720\nwe're gonna move to one of these guys,\nI'm using on a hard-drive.\n\n130\n00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.940\nThis is a little SSD\nthat I'm keeping around.\n\n131\n00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.650\nI think it's a 128 gigs and\nI just had it setup working,\n\n132\n00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.420\nhooked it up to the computer.\n\n133\n00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.440\nI use this, you can use a USB key, too.\n\n134\n00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.590\nThose are all cheaper,\nthese are all faster.\n\n135\n00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.770\nIt kind of depends of what\nyou're trying to get.\n\n136\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.400\nYou plug one of these in and\nyou can boot off of it as a hard drive.\n\n137\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.890\nBut it's got to be a bootable drive.\n\n138\n00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.520\nI can't just copy the installer to it.\n\n139\n00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.560\nSo if you haven't seen how to make that,\njump back to our last episode,\n\n140\n00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.320\nthe getting prepared episode, and\nI show you guys how to make these.\n\n141\n00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.640\nBut once you've got one, doing\nthe installation is really pretty easy.\n\n142\n00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.650\nLet me show you how on this Mac.\n\n143\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.270\nI'm going to take my\ncustom installer here, and\n\n144\n00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.280\nit's not really custom, just what\nApple made And I'm gonna plug that in.\n\n145\n00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.920\nAnd I when I plug it into the system, this\nlittle removable drive's gonna light up\n\n146\n00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.470\nand it's gonna become visible right there.\n\n147\n00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.720\nAnd so you'll see,\nit says install OS X El Capitan.\n\n148\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.680\nAnd if I open that thing up,\nwhat do I see in there?\n\n149\n00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.980\nWell, the installer.\n\n150\n00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.250\nSo it really does look like I\njust copied the installer to it.\n\n151\n00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.020\nbut it's also been flagged as bootable and\nthat's what you miss if you just copy it\n\n152\n00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.230\nyourself, so that's why we had to use that\nspecial process in the first episode.\n\n153\n00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.670\nBut that makes this disk bootable, so\n\n154\n00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.310\nwhen I reboot my computer,\nI can boot right off of it.\n\n155\n00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.090\nNow if I'm my system I could actually\nset that as the start-up disk and\n\n156\n00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.270\nboot off of it, but\nlet's pretend that we've got a problem.\n\n157\n00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.380\nLet's pretend that this Mac is just broken\nand it won't boot up or something's wrong\n\n158\n00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.750\nwell in order to boot to this disk,\nI'm gonna have to use the boot menu.\n\n159\n00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.530\nSo let me shut this one down,\nand I'm gonna shut it down and\n\n160\n00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.180\nonce it goes off, I'm gonna power it on.\n\n161\n00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.910\nBut when I power it on, I'm gonna\nhold down the ALT key on my keyboard,\n\n162\n00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:35.730\nthe option key,\n\n163\n00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.420\nif you've got the full size Apple\nkeyboard where it says ALT and option.\n\n164\n00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.240\nOn the MacBooks it does too on the really\nsmall wireless keyboards it just says\n\n165\n00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.640\noptions I'm gonna hold the Option\nkey while I press Power and\n\n166\n00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.070\nso I'm doing that right now.\n\n167\n00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.330\nSo it's a black screen while it turns on.\n\n168\n00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.960\nAnd if I do it right,\nwhat we should get when it boots up\n\n169\n00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.310\nis we should see this right here,\na list of the hard drives in my system.\n\n170\n00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.020\nIf you do it wrong,\nyou'll see the Apple logo and\n\n171\n00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.910\nthe little bar starts to scroll across.\n\n172\n00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.420\nThat lets you know that you missed\nyour chance to hit the Alt key.\n\n173\n00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.340\nYou'll just have to power off and\npower on again.\n\n174\n00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:15.610\nNow what I expect to see when I boot\nup is usually at least two drives.\n\n175\n00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.010\nI usually expect to see the Macintosh HD\nwhich is this guy right here.\n\n176\n00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.120\nThat's where my operating\nsystem is currently installed.\n\n177\n00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260\nAnd I expect to see Recovery.\n\n178\n00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.130\nAnd notice how mine has\nReovery.10.10.3 Well, in the last episode,\n\n179\n00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:30.960\nI upgraded us to 10.10.5.\n\n180\n00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.232\nThat didn't upgrade\nthe recovery partition.\n\n181\n00:08:35.232 --> 00:08:37.036\nThe recovery partition\nis still at 10.10.3.\n\n182\n00:08:37.036 --> 00:08:41.470\nIf my operating system gets damaged,\nI can boot to the recovery partition and\n\n183\n00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.110\ntry and fix it.\n\n184\n00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.410\nAnd we'll see that in\nthe troubleshooting episodes.\n\n185\n00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.820\nBut if I just had a hard drive failure and\nI had to put a brand new,\n\n186\n00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.140\nblank hard drive in,\nI'm not gonna see either of these.\n\n187\n00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.590\nThey're not there, because these two are\nactually on the same physical hard drive.\n\n188\n00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.980\nYour operating system and the recovery\ndrive are both on the same disk.\n\n189\n00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.010\nThere's just virtual\npartitions inside of it.\n\n190\n00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.750\nAnd then this yellow one right here,\nthat's the installer that I made.\n\n191\n00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.580\nSo if I'm booting on a system with a blank\nhard drive, this might be the only thing\n\n192\n00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:15.110\nthat I see, is just The installer\nthat I've got attached, okay.\n\n193\n00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.110\nIf you boot and it sees nothing, hopefully\nyou'll start to see a globe spin,\n\n194\n00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.270\nand that's where it's reaching out\nto do Internet recovery, right?\n\n195\n00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.840\nSo the globe kinda represents\nthat network connection.\n\n196\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.790\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose my installer, and\n\n197\n00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.480\nI'm gonna boot off of that.\n\n198\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.290\nSo now I see the Apple logo, and\n\n199\n00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.910\nnormally that tells me it's booting\noff my internal hard drive.\n\n200\n00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.050\nBut in this case it's booting\noff of my external drive,\n\n201\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.220\nmy SSD that I've got attached.\n\n202\n00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.190\nSo it's going to boot up and\nwhen it boots up,\n\n203\n00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.730\nit's going to take me into what\neffectively is the recovery partition.\n\n204\n00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.770\nThe recovery partition on the hard drive\ncan give us some tools that we can use to\n\n205\n00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.080\ntroubleshoot and\ntry to repair our machine.\n\n206\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.430\nWhen we boot to an installer like this,\n\n207\n00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.220\nit's basically booting that recovery\npartition but from this external drive.\n\n208\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.650\nBecause we don't know that we can count\non what's on our internal hard-drive.\n\n209\n00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:00.080\nAnd so when it boots up I'll have\nthe option to install OS10 but\n\n210\n00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.050\nI'll also have additional options for\npotentially repairing a damaged disk, or\n\n211\n00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.500\nother things to get the system up and\ngoing.\n\n212\n00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.160\nSo that's gonna boot up, it shouldn't take\nvery long and once it goes we'll get into\n\n213\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.060\nthat now remember the slower your USB\nkey the longer this process will take.\n\n214\n00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.270\n>> Don I was looking you know these\nboot options is this gonna be\n\n215\n00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.790\nsomething that they have to know for\nthe exam?\n\n216\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.900\nCuz really it didn't look much different\nthan maybe in other systems where you're\n\n217\n00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.280\nbooting into bios.\n\n218\n00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.750\n>> Yeah it's very similar.\n\n219\n00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.810\nYou know Apple doesn't let you get\ninto the bios on their systems.\n\n220\n00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.070\n>> Sure.\n>> Or the efi bios\n\n221\n00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.620\n>> But you do need to know the commands to\n\n222\n00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.150\nhold the boot into this stuff so, I held\nthe option key on my keyboard when I\n\n223\n00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.230\nbooted to get to the media list,\nthat's one we need to remember.\n\n224\n00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.880\nIn the troubleshooting episodes\nwe'll learn about command R,\n\n225\n00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.140\nwhich is how we booted into recovery,\n\n226\n00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.010\nthat's another one you'll wanna remember,\nand holding T for target modes.\n\n227\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.400\nWe'll see these all throughout\nthe series as we tackle some of them.\n\n228\n00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.350\n>> All right, now when it boots up,\nthe first thing you'll\n\n229\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.010\nnotice is how everything is\nincredibly small on my screen.\n\n230\n00:10:55.010 --> 00:11:00.230\nWhat we've done is we've booted\na stripped down version of Mac OS.\n\n231\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.700\nRight?\nSo it's running that recovery model.\n\n232\n00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.800\nAnd in the recovery model it doesn't have\nall the great video card drivers and\n\n233\n00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.070\nall that stuff for me And\n\n234\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:11.240\nso it's seeing that my monitor that's\nattached does 19 by 20 resolution, and\n\n235\n00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.950\nthat's what it's scaled itself to,\nand now everything's kinda small.\n\n236\n00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.860\nSo on your laptop, it might look great,\non a desktop where you've got an external\n\n237\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.420\nmonitor it might look\nreally small like this.\n\n238\n00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.810\nIt kinda makes it hard to read.\n\n239\n00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.160\nBut what you're looking at are just\na handful of options here,\n\n240\n00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.820\n>> That are what we can do for\n\n241\n00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.400\nthis machine.\n\n242\n00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.290\nAnd what we normally wanna do is this\nsecond option right here where it says\n\n243\n00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.790\ninstall OS 10.\n\n244\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.030\nI wanna install OS 10.\n\n245\n00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.010\nI wanna get El Capitan installed.\n\n246\n00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.380\nAnd if I do that, it's gonna see\nwhere I've all ready got Yosemite.\n\n247\n00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.980\nAnd it's gonna upgrade me, right?\n\n248\n00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.840\nAnd so I could do the upgrade.\n\n249\n00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.360\nNow this is the harder way to do the\nupgrade, it's better to do it by running\n\n250\n00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.340\nthe icon inside of the Applications folder\non the system if I can do that, right?\n\n251\n00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.750\nSo let's pretend that I've actually\ngot a damaged system, right?\n\n252\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.950\nWell I might have a completely\nblank hard drive.\n\n253\n00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.380\nAnd if I've got a blank hard drive,\nHow can I get my system installed, right?\n\n254\n00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.340\nI need to get that going, and\nthere's a few different things we can do.\n\n255\n00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.410\nLet's walk through some of\nthe tools we've got here so\n\n256\n00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:10.580\nwe can see what's available for us.\n\n257\n00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.970\nRight, so Install OS X,\nthat's the one we normally go for, right,\n\n258\n00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.810\nwe're gonna install the operating system.\n\n259\n00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:20.250\nYou'll also see Restore\nfrom Time Machine backup.\n\n260\n00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.870\nif my system is damaged and\nI've got a time machine backup, I\n\n261\n00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.190\ncan just restore that and I'll be back in\nbusiness and we'll tackle that in the time\n\n262\n00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.540\nmachine episodes, that's not going to\nhelp me upgrade from Yosemite to though.\n\n263\n00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.820\nWhen I restore from that time machine\nbackup, it's going to restore me\n\n264\n00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.550\nto whatever OS I was running when that\nbackup was taken so that's not really\n\n265\n00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.390\nlike an upgrade mechanism Although\nit is a good downgrade mechanism.\n\n266\n00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.490\nI think we mentioned that in the last\nepisode, if I upgrade to El Capitan and\n\n267\n00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.140\nthings go really bad I\ncan boot to recovery and\n\n268\n00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.590\nI can restore from a time machine\nbackup from before the upgrade.\n\n269\n00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.460\nAnd now I can roll back to Yosemite\nagain if I need to, or Mavericks or\n\n270\n00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.120\nwhatever it is I came from.\n\n271\n00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.800\nAll right.\n\n272\n00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.950\nGet help online, that's a fun one.\n\n273\n00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.871\nIf you just don't know what to do.\n\n274\n00:13:00.871 --> 00:13:04.300\n[LAUGH] You wanna access Apple's\ndocumentation and other help files.\n\n275\n00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.960\nGet help online,\nthat's where we can jump in to find that.\n\n276\n00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.730\nAnd then, probably the most important one,\nis this guy right here.\n\n277\n00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:10.870\nDisk Utility.\n\n278\n00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.330\nIf I wanna fix my damaged disk,\nor get the disk ready for\n\n279\n00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.740\ninstall, I'm gonna want that Disk Utility.\n\n280\n00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.480\nSo, for example Maybe my\nsystem is perfectly healthy,\n\n281\n00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.480\nlike this Mac Mini here.\n\n282\n00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.720\nIt's perfectly healthy.\n\n283\n00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.700\nI could've done the upgrade\nfrom inside of the OS.\n\n284\n00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.240\nBut if I do that it's gonna upgrade\nme from Yosemite to El Capitan,\n\n285\n00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.360\nit's gonna keep my applications,\nkeep my documents, keep all that.\n\n286\n00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.680\nMaybe I wanna start fresh and clean.\n\n287\n00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.940\nI want to erase everything.\n\n288\n00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.230\nI wanna start nice and clean,\nget a stock install of El Capitan.\n\n289\n00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:43.580\nI can go into the disk utility, and\nI can erase my hard drive.And now\n\n290\n00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.030\nwhen I do the install, it will be a fresh\nand clean install, instead of an upgrade.\n\n291\n00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.190\nSo that disk utility is real important.\n\n292\n00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.390\nThere are a few other utilities that\nare kind of hidden away that I want to\n\n293\n00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.590\npoint out while we're in here.\n\n294\n00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.330\nSo, for example, if I go up top\nyou've got this utilities menu And,\n\n295\n00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.710\nthe utilities menu,\nagain it will be a little hard to see.\n\n296\n00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.580\nBut, we have the firmware\npassword utility.\n\n297\n00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.610\nWhere we can set a password on\nthe hardware of out system.\n\n298\n00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.060\nWe got the network utility,\n\n299\n00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.870\nwhere you can test your network if\nyour trying to do internet recovery.\n\n300\n00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.310\nLastly, you have terminal.\n\n301\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.090\nAnd, the terminal is the important one.\n\n302\n00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.910\nIf you really have\na problem with your disk,\n\n303\n00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.040\nYou might have to drop to terminal to do a\nfew things, and I know I've had to do this\n\n304\n00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:24.250\nto remove things like EFI partitions that\ndon't show up in disk utility by default.\n\n305\n00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.310\nSo you can jump in and\ntake a look at that.\n\n306\n00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.490\nHopefully you don't have to do that,\n\n307\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.990\nit's not something that we commonly\nhave to do, but it is available.\n\n308\n00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.950\nAvailable, so those are some hidden\naway tools because they're less common.\n\n309\n00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.830\n>> Don, with the disk utility, would you\never use that in a situation where you're\n\n310\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.740\ntrying to provision the drive prior\nto installing the operating system?\n\n311\n00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.420\nNow you mentioned if there is something\ndamaged I'm going to use it, go in there\n\n312\n00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.840\nand try to fix the drive, but how about\nprovisioning the drive before hand?\n\n313\n00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.760\n>> Yeah, great question,\nso if I just go and\n\n314\n00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.600\nchoose install os ten\n>> It's gonna take a look at whatever\n\n315\n00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.560\ndrive I have, and\nit's gonna install on it.\n\n316\n00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.960\nAnd so, if I've got a 1 terabyte\nhard drive like I do in this system,\n\n317\n00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.260\nit's gonna have just a 1\n\n",

00:00:18.781\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're gonna be moving through our\n\n4\n00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:22.054\nApple Certified Support Professional and\nwe've got none other than Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:23.178\nDon Pezet to help us out.\n\n6\n00:00:23.178 --> 00:00:24.690\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.450\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.642\nThanks for having me on the show and\nready to jump into another fun one.\n\n9\n00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:31.916\nIn our other episodes, we've kind of\ntalked a lot about getting OS 10 installed\n\n10\n00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:33.917\nand other different things\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n11\n00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:37.501\nAnd this episode, we're gonna do\nthe thing that Apple doesn't like to talk\n\n12\n00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:40.700\nabout which is told them what to\ndo when things don't work, right?\n\n13\n00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.930\nWhen things aren't going the way we\nexpected, and we need some help.\n\n14\n00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.540\nWe've got some various tools\nthat are available, and\n\n15\n00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.110\nwe've got several troubleshooting\nepisodes that are down the road.\n\n16\n00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.720\nBut in our first couple of episodes,\nI know more than once, I mentioned\n\n17\n00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.000\nthe recovery partition, so we're gonna\nfocus on that from this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.620\nTake a look at what the recovery\npartition is, what it does and\n\n19\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.050\nhow we can use it, and see how it can\nsave our bacon when we're in trouble and\n\n20\n00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.230\nget us by on a tough spot.\n\n21\n00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.448\nSo that's kind of what we've got lined up.\n\n22\n00:01:04.448 --> 00:01:05.985\nAll right, so let's kick this thing off.\n\n23\n00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:11.537\nI have my Mac Mini that I was installing\nEl Capitan on in the last episode,\n\n24\n00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:16.648\nand what I did is halfway through\nthe install I just powered it off.\n\n25\n00:01:16.648 --> 00:01:19.541\nWes was teasing me he was like\nwhy didn't you let it finish and\n\n26\n00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:23.370\nI was like well I need a broken system for\nthe show, so I've got a broken system.\n\n27\n00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.438\nI got half-way through the installer and\nturned it off.\n\n28\n00:01:27.438 --> 00:01:32.360\nSo, if I power it on now,\nit's only got half the system right?\n\n29\n00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.390\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n30\n00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.880\nWell, you'd actually be surprised to\nhow resilient the installer is and\n\n31\n00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.220\nI bet if I powered it on right now, it\nwould probably resume the installation and\n\n32\n00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.070\ntry and complete it out.\n\n33\n00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.273\nApple's really thought that stuff through,\nbut lets say, that it doesn't.\n\n34\n00:01:45.273 --> 00:01:48.744\nLets say, I power it on and\nI get the old sad Mac.\n\n35\n00:01:48.744 --> 00:01:52.839\nI don't know if you guys have ever seen\nthat logo but when a Mac can't boot,\n\n36\n00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:56.882\nit makes this little it's an old SE20 or\nSE2 one of the really old Macs.\n\n37\n00:01:56.882 --> 00:02:01.410\nAnd it's got a frowny face on it with Xs\non it's eyes and it's called the sad Mac.\n\n38\n00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.126\nIt can't boot up, so what do you do?\n\n39\n00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:07.625\nWell, you've got to boot to recovery and\nwhen you boot to recovery you get a whole\n\n40\n00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:10.883\nsuite of utilities that are available\nto help you get over those problems.\n\n41\n00:02:10.883 --> 00:02:13.065\nSo, let's start with the basics,\n\n42\n00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:17.370\nwhat are some of those problems that\nmight lead me to need these tools?\n\n43\n00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.944\nRight?\n\n44\n00:02:17.944 --> 00:02:20.830\nAnd I mentioned a failed\noperating system install.\n\n45\n00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.720\nIf your operating system is corrupt and\n\n46\n00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.140\nyou can't boot it,\nyou're dead in the water, right?\n\n47\n00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.960\nYou got to have an operating system for\neverything else going.\n\n48\n00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.870\nYour applications run on top of the\noperating system we got to have it, right?\n\n49\n00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.910\nOther things, maybe I'm booting up and\nthe system just freezes.\n\n50\n00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.993\nI've seen this were you get the Apple\nlogo, and that little black bar is going\n\n51\n00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:42.440\nacross to its halfway, and\nthen it just stops and just sits there.\n\n52\n00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.910\nSits there for minutes, hours, days,\nhowever long it is that you have patience\n\n53\n00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.330\nfor, it just sits there,\nit's stuck, right?\n\n54\n00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.710\nSomething has gotten corrupted under\nthe hood and we can't see what that is.\n\n55\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.940\nThere's ways that you can make the Mac\nshow you a little more information, but\n\n56\n00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.320\nit doesn't give you a ton and so you\ndon't know why it's basically freezing.\n\n57\n00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.040\nSo we're stuck,\nwe're kinda trapped, all right?\n\n58\n00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.480\nOther things, maybe your system seems that\nit's running fine but then, every now and\n\n59\n00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.830\nthen you run an application and\n\n60\n00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.134\nyou get the little spinning\npinwheel of doom right?\n\n61\n00:03:11.134 --> 00:03:14.970\nAnd your system just freezes and then\nlater on it does it again and it does it\n\n62\n00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.035\nagain and there's no real pattern to it,\nit just happens a lot and it's annoying.\n\n63\n00:03:18.035 --> 00:03:21.015\nAnd your system freezes, and\nmaybe you have to reboot, maybe you don't.\n\n64\n00:03:21.015 --> 00:03:24.405\nWell, a lot of times I\ncommunicate failing memory and\n\n65\n00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:27.495\nthere's ways that we can test on our\nMac to see if we have failing memory,\n\n66\n00:03:27.495 --> 00:03:30.845\nsee that's what the issue is cuz\nthat's often what results in that.\n\n67\n00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:33.035\nBut it could be a corrupted\noperating system also, and\n\n68\n00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:35.485\nthe solution there really is to\nreinstall the operating system.\n\n69\n00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:39.620\nIf you reinstall the OS, that'll clean\nup all the files back to factory and\n\n70\n00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.940\nthen you should be able to boot it and\nget by.\n\n71\n00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.650\nIt could be third party\nsoftware stopping it though.\n\n72\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.410\nAnd if I reinstall the OS,\nit's really creating the broken OS.\n\n73\n00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.220\nAnd so your application stays, so I might\nneed to get that application out of there.\n\n74\n00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.601\nAnd I can't do that if I can't\nboot my operating system, so\n\n75\n00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:56.099\nI need some way to do that.\n\n76\n00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.769\nThose are some of the key ones, failing\nram is one, bad sectors on a hard drive,\n\n77\n00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:01.270\nright?\n\n78\n00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.100\nIf you hard drive starts to fail and\nthere's a lot of third\n\n79\n00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.260\nparty programs out there that say,\nwe can fix your hard drive.\n\n80\n00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.030\nAnd you run it and it'll scan your hard\ndrive, i t'll find bad sectors and\n\n81\n00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.850\nit'll try and move your data off.\n\n82\n00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.870\nBut the reality is those programs,\n\n83\n00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.470\nI'm not gonna say they're a complete\nwaste of money, there's a use for them.\n\n84\n00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.390\nIf your data is locked\naway in bad sectors,\n\n85\n00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.950\nthat software can sometimes get your\ndata back and there's value in that, so\n\n86\n00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.380\nthere is certainly value, but\nthere's no long-term value.\n\n87\n00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.690\nAs soon as you get your\nfiles out of there,\n\n88\n00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.210\nyou need to replace that hard drive.\n\n89\n00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.340\nBecause when a hard drive starts to fail,\nit doesn't stop to fail.\n\n90\n00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.800\nIt doesn't say, well, you got the data\noff that bad sector, we're all good now.\n\n91\n00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.250\nNo, it started to fail, it's just\ngonna get worse and worse and worse.\n\n92\n00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.400\nSo the very first time that happens,\nthat's your warning, right?\n\n93\n00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.425\nThat's your warning,\n\n94\n00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:47.458\nget your data off of here quick make\nsure you got a time machine backup.\n\n95\n00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:50.894\nBut, if you fix that little problem,\nyou run DiskWarrior.\n\n96\n00:04:50.894 --> 00:04:53.658\nDiskWarrior is great, it'll cover up\nall sorts of data off your drive.\n\n97\n00:04:53.658 --> 00:04:57.431\nSo you run DiskWarrior, it gets your data\noff of there and you say, okay, well,\n\n98\n00:04:57.431 --> 00:04:59.335\nnow my data's good, you keep running.\n\n99\n00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:02.253\nWell, you've got a ticking time\nbomb inside your computer and so\n\n100\n00:05:02.253 --> 00:05:05.234\nyou definitely don't want that,\nyou need to replace that drive.\n\n101\n00:05:05.234 --> 00:05:07.934\nOur problem could just be user accident,\nI've seen this,\n\n102\n00:05:07.934 --> 00:05:10.259\nwhere a user's browsing\naround on the hard drive.\n\n103\n00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.805\nAnd they've got admin\nrights on the machine,\n\n104\n00:05:12.805 --> 00:05:16.340\ncuz that's what most people do and\nthey start deleting things.\n\n105\n00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.470\nThey install some software.\n\n106\n00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.940\nThey do some things that damage\nthe computer and now it won't boot.\n\n107\n00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.950\nAll of these are things that lead\nto a system that's not usable, and\n\n108\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.870\nour first line of defense,\nour first tool Is the recovery console.\n\n109\n00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.460\nIf we've got failing memory,\nour operating system will be locking up.\n\n110\n00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.190\nIf you boot to the recovery console, the\nrecovery console will be locking up also.\n\n111\n00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.640\nIt's a great way to diagnose that.\n\n112\n00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.220\nWhen you boot to recovery, it's a very\nstripped-down version of Mac OS.\n\n113\n00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.890\nIt's not running any applications or\nthird-party drivers.\n\n114\n00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.462\nIt's just running the base system for\nthe recovery.\n\n115\n00:05:47.462 --> 00:05:51.580\nAnd so the problem is still exhibited\nthere, that kind of takes the operating\n\n116\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.750\nsystem out of the mix and\nall that is left is your hardware.\n\n117\n00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.470\nThe recovery council is a great\nway to just make that judgement.\n\n118\n00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.380\nNow, there is actually a hidden hardware\ndiagnostics inside of your MAC.\n\n119\n00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.950\nIt's one of those documented but\nundocumented features.\n\n120\n00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.442\nApple doesn't talk about it much,\n\n121\n00:06:06.442 --> 00:06:08.838\ncuz they really expect the genius\nbars to use it, right?\n\n122\n00:06:08.838 --> 00:06:10.880\nYou take it to an Apple Store and\nthey will use it.\n\n123\n00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.080\nBut if you put up your Mac while\nholding the D key on your keyboard,\n\n124\n00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.480\nit'll boot to a diagnostic mode, and we'll\nsee that in a troubleshooting episode.\n\n125\n00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.750\nAnd so it can check and look for\nbad memory, bad hard drive, and so on.\n\n126\n00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.500\nThe only negative thing about\nthe diagnostic tool is that it\n\n127\n00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.580\ntakes a long time.\n\n128\n00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.000\nSo it's one of those where I usually\nstart up before going to bed and\n\n129\n00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.880\nthen you check it in the morning,\n\n130\n00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.220\nor start up before going lunch, cuz it'll\ntake an hour or two to do its thing.\n\n131\n00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.900\nAnd then tell you whether\nyour machine is healthy,\n\n132\n00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.600\nso it can take a while if\nit's scanning the hard drive.\n\n133\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.270\nIf it's not scanning the hard drive,\nit's a lot faster but\n\n134\n00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.920\nif it's scanning the drive,\nit does take a while.\n\n135\n00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.670\nAll right, so let's say that\nmy system is not able to boot.\n\n136\n00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.440\nI can't get into my operating system and\nI wanna go to recovery.\n\n137\n00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.770\nWell, there's a few things we need\nto be aware of ahead of time,\n\n138\n00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.280\nbefore we get to that point, right?\n\n139\n00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.740\nSo when your Mac is perfectly healthy,\n\n140\n00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.800\nthere's some steps you should take to\nmake sure that you're gonna be okay.\n\n141\n00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.230\nOn an older Mac, it can actually be a bit\nof a challenge and let me tell you what.\n\n142\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.850\nIf you bought a Mac from Apple, then it\nships it to you with MAC OS loaded on it\n\n143\n00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.030\nand with recovery partition\nright there on the hard drive.\n\n144\n00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.570\nSo it's ready to go,\nits got the recovery partition.\n\n145\n00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.158\nBut if your hard drive fails,\nwhere is your recovery partition?\n\n146\n00:07:17.158 --> 00:07:18.400\nIt's gone.\n\n147\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.190\nYou don't have one.\n\n148\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.980\nYou lost the operating system and\nthe recovery partition.\n\n149\n00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.730\nIt's gone.\nYou can't boost to recovery.\n\n150\n00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.020\nA newer Macs,\nones made in the last three years or\n\n151\n00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.980\nso, they have whats\ncalled Internet recovery.\n\n152\n00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.010\nSo even if there's no hard drive\nin the system, they can boot up,\n\n153\n00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.720\nreach out across the Internet to Apple and\nload recovery from Apple.\n\n154\n00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.290\nSo, we're covered from that,\non a bad hard drive.\n\n155\n00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.130\nBut, what if you got a Mac that's four or\nfive years old and\n\n156\n00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.990\ndoesn't have an Internet recovery?\n\n157\n00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.070\nAnd your hard drive failed,\nare you just out of luck?\n\n158\n00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.686\nWell, you could take it to the Apple\nStore, they'll fix it for you, but\n\n159\n00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:51.061\nyou could fix it yourself.\n\n160\n00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:55.400\nAll you need is an installation media,\nremember in the very first episode I made\n\n161\n00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.310\na removable drive that had El Capitan\non it, so it's got an installer.\n\n162\n00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.281\nWell, the installer for\nEl Capitan really is the recovery mode.\n\n163\n00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:06.435\nSo I can just boot off of\ninstallation media and do it.\n\n164\n00:08:06.435 --> 00:08:10.320\nThat works with Maverick, Yosemite,\nEl Capitan, all the newer ones.\n\n165\n00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.520\nIf you got older ones like Mountain Lion,\nthere's actually a different utility.\n\n166\n00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.350\nIf you go to Apple's site and search for\nthe recovery, what is it called,\n\n167\n00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.690\nrecovery disk assistant,\nrecovery, yeah that's it.\n\n168\n00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.310\nRecovery disk assistant.\n\n169\n00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.180\nIf you go to Apple's website and\ndo a search for recovery disk assistant,\n\n170\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.480\nback in the Mountain Lion days,\nthey had this program you would download.\n\n171\n00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.370\nAnd it would help you make a recover disk.\n\n172\n00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.990\nAnd it could be a USB key, or\nit could actually make DVDs too,\n\n173\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.280\nin some of the older versions.\n\n174\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.430\nAnd so you could create media\nthat way to do the install.\n\n175\n00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.550\nIn our newer systems we don't\nhave that anymore, right?\n\n176\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.660\nSo, the recovery disk assistant.\n\n177\n00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.680\nIt stopped with Mountain Lion.\n\n178\n00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.040\nIf you're running something newer\nthan Mountain Lion, do not use it.\n\n179\n00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.950\nInstead, just make\nremovable install media.\n\n180\n00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.180\nIt's got everything you need.\n\n181\n00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.950\nIt's perfect and it works great.\n\n182\n00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.430\nOr you can use Internet Recovery, right?\n\n183\n00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.590\nSo let me show you these kind of\nrecovery models and how they work.\n\n184\n00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.760\nI've got my Mac mini over here that I\npowered off during the install, okay?\n\n185\n00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.090\nSo, I'm gonna take it, I'm gonna\npower it on and when I power it on,\n\n186\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.810\nI'm just gonna hold the alt key\non it while it boots, okay.\n\n187\n00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.840\nSo, let's gonna boot up right now,\nI'm holding my alt key and\n\n188\n00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.810\nwhat I should see is a list of\nhard drives that I can boot from.\n\n189\n00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.640\nAnd here they are and\nmy Mackintosh HD doesn't show up.\n\n190\n00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.940\nBecause I interrupted\nthe install it didn't finish.\n\n191\n00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.810\nSo I'm seeing the recovery partition\nthat's on the hard drive inside of\n\n192\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:24.770\nthe machine.\n\n193\n00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.050\nThat's still intact, I can boot from that.\n\n194\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.180\nAlso, I see my installation media.\n\n195\n00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.450\nThat is the removable\ndrive I've got attached.\n\n196\n00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.310\nI can boot to either one of those, and\nthey'll take me to the exact same place.\n\n197\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.470\nThey'll take me to\nthe recovery on this system.\n\n198\n00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:43.790\nOkay, but what if I go to boot my system,\nand it's got not hard drive.\n\n199\n00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.350\nOr the hard drive is\ncompletely truly blank.\n\n200\n00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.350\nIt's got no hidden recovery partition.\n\n201\n00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:53.200\nI didn't make a recovery drive, I didn't\nmake an installable media ahead of time.\n\n202\n00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.910\nI'm going to boot my system and\n\n203\n00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.990\nthere's not going to be\na system that I can boot from.\n\n204\n00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.094\nI'll get that circle with\nthe slash through it and\n\n205\n00:10:00.094 --> 00:10:03.490\nthere's nothing it can boot,\nI'm out of luck, aren't I?\n\n206\n00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.590\nWell, not necessarily.\n\n207\n00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.940\nWhat your system will more than likely\ndo is automatically go into Internet\n\n208\n00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:14.230\nrecovery, where it reaches out to Apple\nand it tries to boot from them, okay?\n\n209\n00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.650\nNow Internet recovery doesn't\nnecessarily show up by default.\n\n210\n00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.590\nSee I got this option right\nhere to choose a network.\n\n211\n00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.990\nIt's asking me to\nconfigure my wireless card.\n\n212\n00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.220\nI don't have my wired network plugged in\non this one so it's not showing up, but\n\n213\n00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.460\non a wireless SATA I can pick a wireless\nnetwork like i pick the it for\n\n214\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.140\ntv one, right.\n\n215\n00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.690\nAnd why does it care what the wireless\nnetwork is, if i got a perfectly\n\n216\n00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:42.040\nvalid recovery partition on my system, why\ndoes it care about the wireless network.\n\n217\n00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.530\nWell once it's connected to a wireless\nnetwork it can get to the internet and\n\n218\n00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.850\nit can get to Apple.\n\n219\n00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:52.620\nAnd once it can get to Apple it\ncan load Recovery from Apple.\n\n220\n00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.780\nNow mines not going to do it or\nat least not do it right away.\n\n221\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.560\nBecause I've got my local\ndisk it can just use that.\n\n222\n00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.660\nBut if I sit here and wait long enough,\nI'm not going to [INAUDIBLE] on this one.\n\n223\n00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.440\nEventually a globe will\nappear as a third option.\n\n224\n00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.840\nAnd that globe is Apple, right.\n\n225\n00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.880\nNow, let's say that we wanna force this,\nI booted this up while holding my Alt key\n\n226\n00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.190\nand the Alt key shows all of the different\ndrives that are out there, right.\n\n227\n00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.910\nI'm gonna power this off and\n\n228\n00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:23.315\nanother thing that I could have done is\nI could have powered it on with Cmd+R.\n\n229\n00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:26.275\nIf I hold Cmd+R while I\npower on the system, okay?\n\n230\n00:11:26.275 --> 00:11:29.005\nSo the screen is gonna go black\nhere in a second, there we go.\n\n231\n00:11:29.005 --> 00:11:32.545\nAnd I'm just holding\nCmd+R while it boots up.\n\n232\n00:11:32.545 --> 00:11:35.885\nAnd we'll see how long my patience can,\nright?\n\n233\n00:11:35.885 --> 00:11:38.395\nI get impatient sometimes when powering\noff the machine when it's actually\n\n234\n00:11:38.395 --> 00:11:39.055\npowered on.\n\n235\n00:11:39.055 --> 00:11:43.570\nAnd then you know disregard that but\nI'm gonna hold command r and\n\n236\n00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.330\nwhat it's gonna do is instead of\nshowing me a boot menu right I' m not\n\n237\n00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.030\nseeing the drives it just\nimmediately starts to boot.\n\n238\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.860\nAnd normally when I see the Apple\nlogo that's how I remember\n\n239\n00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.490\nshoot I missed the boot menu\nnow I got to turn it off.\n\n240\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.780\nBut what's actually happening is I was\nholding command r while it booted.\n\n241\n00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.980\nAnd that told it hey Boot from recovery.\n\n242\n00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.760\nAnd so that's exactly what it's doing.\n\n243\n00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.170\nIt's just looking at the harddrive,\nit's finding that recovery partition, and\n\n244\n00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.930\nit's now going to boot off of it.\n\n245\n00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.480\n>> Don with the recovery online,\nand when it reaches out to Apple,\n\n246\n00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.090\nis that just pulling down\nthe recovery utility itself and\n\n247\n00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.060\nloading it to RAM and then you,\n>> Proceed with the installation there,\n\n248\n00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.970\nor can it do both, the whole thing?\n\n249\n00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.050\n>> It's both, so when it connects the\nfirst time, it is just getting recovery.\n\n250\n00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.880\nIt downloads somewhere between 700 and 800\nmegabytes of data, which is that base OS.\n\n251\n00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.150\nAnd once it gets that it boots to that,\nthat's recovery.\n\n252\n00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:36.950\nAnd only if you choose Install OS X\ndoes it actually reach out to Apple and\n\n253\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:38.290\nstart to download the rest.\n\n254\n00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.940\nAnd it'll have to do a little verification\nto make sure your Mac is allowed.\n\n255\n00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.290\nCuz They're always checking for\n\n256\n00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:46.510\nthe Hackintosh systems, where people\nhave kind of built up fake hardware.\n\n257\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.350\nSo they do check for that, but\notherwise they let you do the install.\n\n258\n00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.370\nIt's all done from the internet.\n\n259\n00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.140\nSo that system's booted up now and\nI'm in recovery.\n\n260\n00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.810\nRight?\nIt never did give me a boot menu,\n\n261\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.130\nit just booted straight to this.\n\n262\n00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.780\nCommand R takes you right to recovery.\n\n263\n00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.840\nNow if I had no hard drive it would\nof tried internet recovery and\n\n264\n00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.580\nyou can force internet\nrecovery if you want.\n\n265\n00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:12.310\nCommand R booted to recovery, command\noption R will boot to internet recovery.\n\n266\n00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.880\nYou don't normally have to force it\nthough because normally your system's so\n\n267\n00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.500\ndamaged that it knows it\nneeds to go to the internet.\n\n268\n00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.810\nAnd that's what it does But let's say\nthat I wanna take this system and\n\n269\n00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.660\nI'm gonna just shut it down again.\n\n270\n00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:28.110\nAnd once it shut down, I'll do command\noption R when I booted this time and\n\n271\n00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.600\nthat's gonna tell it that I really,\nreally wanna do internet recovery.\n\n272\n00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.805\nDid I not click shut down hard enough?\n\n273\n00:13:33.805 --> 00:13:37.350\n[LAUGH]\nApparently the system doesn't wanna shut\n\n274\n00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.880\ndown for me.\n\n275\n00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.765\nIt must still be thinking.\n\n276\n00:13:38.765 --> 00:13:41.569\n[NOISE] What?\n\n277\n00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:44.890\nWe'll do the old-fashioned,\nhold the power button down on this thing.\n\n278\n00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.530\nIt will shut down.\n\n279\n00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.430\nThere we go.\n\n280\n00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.210\nAll right, so what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna power this on,\n\n281\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.100\nand you're gonna see the screen\ngo black for a second.\n\n282\n00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.480\nAnd I'm holding command option R,\n\n283\n00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.870\nor if you're on a Windows keyboard it\nwould be like Windows alt R, I guess, but\n\n284\n00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:05.320\ncommand option R And see how instead\nof an Apple, this time I got a globe.\n\n285\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.630\nI forced internet recovery.\n\n286\n00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.710\nAnd now it's gonna look for a wireless\nnetwork, but it already knows my\n\n287\n00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.770\nwireless network because remember\nI put it in a few moments ago?\n\n288\n00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.750\nApple saves that in their bios,\nin the memory on the motherboard,\n\n289\n00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.410\nso it literally knows my wireless network.\n\n290\n00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.650\nSo it's gonna look out on the internet,\nit's gonna find Apple And\n\n291\n00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.700\nit's gonna download the 700 or\n800 MB recovery operating system.\n\n292\n00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.010\nIt's gonna boot that, all from RAM.\n\n293\n00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:29.940\nIt's doing it from RAM.\n\n294\n00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.810\nAnd that's one of the reason the older\nMACs didn't support this was they didn't\n\n295\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.480\nhave enough RAM for it.\n\n296\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.540\nBut your new MACs do.\n\n297\n00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.410\nThey can boot this stuff up and\nit'll run just fine.\n\n298\n00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.270\nSo there it goes.\n\n299\n00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.190\nAnd it's kind of small but there's\na little timer that disappeared that says\n\n300\n00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.070\nit's gonna take four more\nminutes before it boots up.\n\n301\n00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.400\nSo that one is gonna boot.\n\n302\n00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.240\n>> And\nwhen it's done we'll be in that recovery.\n\n303\n00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.780\nNow while we're waiting on that,\nlet's jump over to a different machine.\n\n304\n00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.810\nI've got my own laptop here and\n\n305\n00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.810\nI've got a virtual machine that\nI have fired up into recovery.\n\n306\n00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.190\n>> So that we can see it.\n\n307\n00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.820\nOne of the problems with recovery mode,\nyou guys have probably noticed this in\n\n308\n00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:08.130\nthe show so far, is that when I boot to\nit, it's always really small, isn't it.\n\n309\n00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.650\nAnd that's cuz it doesn't have\nvideo card drivers and things.\n\n310\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:14.660\nSo I've got one booted up here on my\ncomputer that is In a virtual machine so\n\n311\n00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.180\nI can make it big and we can actually\nread the stuff that's on the screen.\n\n312\n00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.510\nSo in the previous episodes I talked about\nrestoring from Time Machine backup right?\n\n313\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.850\nOr reinstalling the OS X.\n\n314\n00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.120\nGetting help online.\n\n315\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.290\nDisk Utility.\n\n316\n00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.530\nThese were all the different\nthings that I could use to try and\n\n317\n00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.170\nget over a failed start.\n\n318\n00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:39.100\nSo let's say for example that I'm\ndealing with Corrupted drive, right?\n\n319\n00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.380\nSo I think the data on my hard\ndrive is corrupted or damaged.\n\n320\n00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.200\nWell I could go into Disk Utility,\nright, and so we'll continue into that.\n\n321\n00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.970\nAnd it's gonna launch the Disk Utility,\nand\n\n322\n00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.740\nonce I'm in there I can\nfind my hard drives.\n\n323\n00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.860\nHere's the Macintosh HD.\n\n324\n00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.232\nI can choose that and\nyou got first aid right here.\n\n325\n00:15:57.232 --> 00:16:01.110\nNow the recovery I'm booted into\nis the El Capitan recovery.\n\n326\n00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.667\nRight?\n\n327\n00:16:01.667 --> 00:16:07.101\nAnd El Capitan's recovery in disk utility\nlooks different than Yosemite and earlier.\n\n328\n00:16:07.101 --> 00:16:09.597\nIf you boot into Yosemite or earlier,\nthe main screen looks the same but\n\n329\n00:16:09.597 --> 00:16:12.320\nwhen you get into disk utility\nthe disk utility looks different.\n\n330\n00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.490\nSo on those you would choose the hard\ndrive and then you would have the buttons\n\n331\n00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.295\ndown here, to do the optimize and\nrepair with a two separate buttons.\n\n332\n00:16:20.295 --> 00:16:23.795\nWell, in El Capitan, Apple realized\nthat people always hit both.\n\n333\n00:16:23.795 --> 00:16:25.145\nSo, they just roll them\ninto the same button,\n\n334\n00:16:25.145 --> 00:16:27.305\nand its now this first aide button.\n\n335\n00:16:27.305 --> 00:16:31.265\nSo, if I think this hard drive is damaged,\nI think I have corrupted files or\n\n336\n00:16:31.265 --> 00:16:33.165\nsomething is stopping me from booting.\n\n337\n00:16:33.165 --> 00:16:35.478\nI can just choose my Macintosh HD.\n\n338\n00:16:35.478 --> 00:16:40.354\nI can hit First Aid and it's going\nto run the optimizing repair on it.\n\n339\n00:16:40.354 --> 00:16:43.535\nIt's going to take a look at it,\nit's gonna check permissions, right?\n\n340\n00:16:43.535 --> 00:16:46.180\nThat was the other button, that was\ncheck permissions and then repair.\n\n341\n00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.180\nSo it's gonna check the permissions and\n\n342\n00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.008\nit's going to repair any damages that it\nfinds to try and get the system online.\n\n343\n00:16:52.008 --> 00:16:55.560\nSo see here, it's checking the volume,\nit's going/doing scanning it\n\n344\n00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.850\nmaking sure that it's bootable,\nupdating the boot support files.\n\n345\n00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:03.360\nIt's doing all of these things to\nmake the system bootable again.\n\n346\n00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:08.720\nSo if I can boot, I can boot to recovery,\ngo in to Disk Utility and run First Aid.\n\n347\n00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.373\nIt's one of the first things that I do to\nmake sure that I can get in to the system.\n\n348\n00:17:12.373 --> 00:17:16.795\nAnd once that's done, now my disk should\nbe okay and, I can go ahead and boot and\n\n349\n00:17:16.795 --> 00:17:19.978\ngo the rest of the way and\nget into the system, all right?\n\n350\n00:17:19.978 --> 00:17:24.786\nIf that isn't enough,\nthen I might need to reinstall OS 10.\n\n351\n00:17:24.786 --> 00:17:28.079\nAnd if I think I've got corrupted data,\nthen the best thing to do is to erase this\n\n352\n00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:32.060\ndrive, to just say look, I've got bad data\non here, I don't want that hanging about.\n\n353\n00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.250\nSo, I'm gonna choose that Macintosh HD and\nI'm gonna erase it.\n\n354\n00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.867\nAnd when we erase it, we can format it,\n\n355\n00:17:36.867 --> 00:17:38.635\nyou can change the file\nsystem if you want.\n\n356\n00:17:38.635 --> 00:17:43.318\nBut that Mac OS X Extended Journaled,\nthat was really the best one for\n\n357\n00:17:43.318 --> 00:17:48.160\nus and we can choose that, wipes\nthe disk and now you are in business, so\n\n358\n00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.856\nyou can then go and install the system.\n\n359\n00:17:50.856 --> 00:17:53.520\nAll right, so that's one of the different\nthings that we can do in here.\n\n360\n00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.310\nThere are other things that we\ncan do from inside of recovery.\n\n361\n00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:02.250\nSo for example, normally restoring from\na Time Machine Backup, reinstalling OS X,\n\n362\n00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.170\nthose are our normal options but\nthere's plenty more.\n\n363\n00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:09.200\nLet's say for example,\nthat every time I boot this Mac up,\n\n364\n00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.670\nthere's a third party\nprogram that tries to start.\n\n365\n00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:16.290\nAnd as soon as it tries to start my\nsystem seg faults and reboots, right?\n\n366\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:21.328\nAnd so it's crashing and it's crashing\nbefore I can even get into the system.\n\n367\n00:18:21.328 --> 00:18:26.366\nAnd so that program, I need it to stop\nloading when I go to log in, right?\n\n368\n00:18:26.366 --> 00:18:27.440\nWell, there is a few ways.\n\n369\n00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.530\nWe'll talk about single user mode in\nanother episode but one of the easier ways\n\n370\n00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.440\nto deal with it is when we're in recovery,\nyou can go up to the utilities menu up\n\n371\n00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.885\ntop, and in the utilities menu you\ncan go and pull up the terminal.\n\n372\n00:18:38.885 --> 00:18:41.375\nAnd the terminal is really cool,\n\n373\n00:18:41.375 --> 00:18:46.570\nit's our bash shell,\nour Unix terminal inside of Mac OS.\n\n374\n00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.710\nWhen you're inside of that,\nyou have full access to the system.\n\n375\n00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:55.410\nYou can browse around and see the hard\ndrive, the files and all of that.\n\n376\n00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:01.220\nIf I come in here and\ntake a look at my Volumes folder,\n\n377\n00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:06.560\nI can see the Macintosh hard drive,\nthe OS X Base System in Image Volume.\n\n378\n00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.810\nThat's because I'm booting a recovery,\n\n379\n00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.350\nthose are those virtual drives\nthat are part of recovery.\n\n380\n00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:15.198\nBut Macintosh HD,\nthat is my actual hard drive.\n\n381\n00:19:15.198 --> 00:19:17.060\nSo I'm gonna change directory into that,\nso\n\n382\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.740\nmy directory is now slash volumes,\nslash Macintosh HD.\n\n383\n00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.970\nAnd once I'm in there, I can do things\nlike get into my applications folder and\n\n384\n00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:30.940\nso now, I'm in the Applications folder,\nand I can pull up all of my applications.\n\n385\n00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.880\nAnd if I've got one in here that's causing\nme problems, I can delete it, right?\n\n386\n00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.920\nNow you don't wanna delete a default one,\nthese are all default applications here.\n\n387\n00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.650\nI don't wanna delete any of those but\nif I had third party applications,\n\n388\n00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.180\nI could just delete it right here.\n\n389\n00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.610\nGet it out of there and that way,\nwhen my system goes to boot,\n\n390\n00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.890\nthat program might try to run, but\nit can't run now cuz it's been deleted.\n\n391\n00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.440\nRight, we just got it out of there and\nkilled it, and now we can boot and\n\n392\n00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.090\nget the rest of the way into the system.\n\n393\n00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.090\nThat's something we can do in recovery.\n\n394\n00:19:54.090 --> 00:20:01.240\nYou also have the disk utility,\nwhat is it, diskutilityCS, is that it?\n\n395\n00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.830\nThere's a command line\nversion of the DIsk Utility,\n\n396\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.490\nI can't remember the command for\nit though.\n\n397\n00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.511\nAnd once you're in here, you can to start\nto use that to do really advanced things.\n\n398\n00:20:09.511 --> 00:20:12.406\nAnd you'll see that where\nApple will sometime say,\n\n399\n00:20:12.406 --> 00:20:14.468\nyou've got to wipe your EFI partition.\n\n400\n00:20:14.468 --> 00:20:17.644\nAnd when you boot into Disk Utility\nyou don't see the EFI partition,\n\n401\n00:20:17.644 --> 00:20:18.860\nit doesn't even show up.\n\n402\n00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.640\nYou don't even see the recovery\npartition in the Disk Utility.\n\n403\n00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.263\nSo for example,\nif I go back into my Disk Utility,\n\n404\n00:20:24.263 --> 00:20:27.449\nthere's a lot of partitions that\ndon't show up in here and so\n\n405\n00:20:27.449 --> 00:20:31.086\nthe command line version of Disk Utility\nwill let you see that stuff.\n\n406\n00:20:31.086 --> 00:20:35.539\nThese other petitions that aren't here and\nthere's other things you can do to\n\n407\n00:20:35.539 --> 00:20:38.994\nDisk Utility to make those show up too but\nnot from recovery.\n\n408\n00:20:38.994 --> 00:20:42.405\nSo we're kind of limited in what we can\nsee from the command line we can get into\n\n409\n00:20:42.405 --> 00:20:42.990\nthat stuff.\n\n410\n00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:46.040\nSo those are all different things\nthat we can do from recovery.\n\n411\n00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:46.820\nIt's very powerful.\n\n412\n00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.820\nIt's a great way to get\nback into that system and\n\n413\n00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.960\nwith Internet recovery\nwe can always get to it,\n\n414\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.110\neven if our hard drive is completely\nblank and that's really valuable.\n\n415\n00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.130\nLet's check back in on that other system.\n\n416\n00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.550\nI'm gonna switch back over to my Mac Mini.\n\n417\n00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.918\nRemember, it said it had four\nminutes to go on doing that install.\n\n418\n00:21:04.918 --> 00:21:06.905\nAnd it's not really an install, right?\n\n419\n00:21:06.905 --> 00:21:08.390\nI'm booting to recovery.\n\n420\n00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:10.180\nSo if we jump back over to that one and\n\n421\n00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.010\ntake a look at its screen,\nlet's see what we've got on it.\n\n422\n00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.893\nIt's booting from apple, so it is reaching\nall the way out to them, and in theory,\n\n423\n00:21:18.893 --> 00:21:21.020\nit's loading that recovery partition.\n\n424\n00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.480\n>> That terminal command Don, that you\nwere talking about, is that disk util?\n\n425\n00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.102\nIs that the one that you're talking about?\n\n426\n00:21:27.102 --> 00:21:30.100\n>> You might be right, I thought it was\nDisk Utility, but we'll try right here.\n\n427\n00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.980\nLooking at the Mac Mini, I can see that\nit has actually booted to recovery.\n\n428\n00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.730\nNow remember,\nI booted the [INAUDIBLE], right?\n\n429\n00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.570\nI did command, option,\nR to force end that recovery.\n\n430\n00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.470\nI'm now running that same recovery\nenvironment just like we saw in\n\n431\n00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:46.870\nthe other machines, except this time\nit's entirely loaded from Apple.\n\n432\n00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.170\nIt's not loaded from this machine at all.\n\n433\n00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:52.750\nAnd if I were to choose something like,\nreinstall OS X,\n\n434\n00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.392\nwhere is that gonna come from?\n\n435\n00:21:54.392 --> 00:21:58.090\nIt's gonna come from Apple, just like\ndownloading it out of the App Store,\n\n436\n00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.780\nit's gonna download to get\nit put on this machine.\n\n437\n00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.960\nI'll show you that in just a second,\nbut before I do that, let's find out,\n\n438\n00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.950\nI really wanna find that\nDisk Utility command.\n\n439\n00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:10.330\nSo let me go back up here to utilities and\nterminal and\n\n440\n00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:14.150\nonce that comes up I'll make the font\nsize something not microscopic.\n\n441\n00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:18.010\nThere we go, so I ran diskutil,\nyou were saying diskutil, Wes?\n\n442\n00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.560\nSure enough there it is, all right.\n\n443\n00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.290\nSo, you get bonus points this episode.\n\n444\n00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.725\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n445\n00:22:23.725 --> 00:22:26.870\n>> [LAUGH] So looking at it here, you can\nsee Disk Utility, and there is a ton of\n\n446\n00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:31.630\nstuff in here, but the command that\nI use the most is diskutil list.\n\n447\n00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.750\nBecause it's gonna show me all of\nthe partitions on my system it's gonna lay\n\n448\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:39.740\nthem out, and I will see a ton of stuff\nin here that you wouldn't normally see.\n\n449\n00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.420\nAnd so, when I look up here\nI can see an EFI partition,\n\n450\n00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:48.350\na 200 MB partition that's part\nof EFI bios boot part process.\n\n451\n00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.962\nThat's hidden in Disk Utility, and\n\n452\n00:22:50.962 --> 00:22:55.604\nI can see here's my Macintosh HD,\nhere is my Storage HD, right?\n\n453\n00:22:55.604 --> 00:22:59.637\nI created both of those and then Recovery\nHD right here, I didn't create that,\n\n454\n00:22:59.637 --> 00:23:01.757\nthat's the hidden recovery partition.\n\n455\n00:23:01.757 --> 00:23:06.519\nSo you can see all the partitions and\nif I want to truly scrub the disk and\n\n456\n00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:08.720\nget everything off of it.\n\n457\n00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.960\nI can use the disk util command link,\ndisk util not utility and\n\n458\n00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.960\nsee that and work with it.\n\n459\n00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.910\nSo that's another tool that we've\ngot available for us right here.\n\n460\n00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:20.430\nSame thing with like fsck which\nis the file system check utility,\n\n461\n00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:24.537\nthat'll let you scan a hard drive and\nlook for failures and other problems.\n\n462\n00:23:24.537 --> 00:23:27.691\nThat's really what we're running\nwhen we go into this utility and\n\n463\n00:23:27.691 --> 00:23:28.717\nwe choose First Aid.\n\n464\n00:23:28.717 --> 00:23:30.574\nIt's really using that\nfile system check utility.\n\n465\n00:23:30.574 --> 00:23:32.280\nIt's using part of that, all right?\n\n466\n00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.504\nNow, Wes had asked about installing\nOS X from recovery and if I,\n\n467\n00:23:36.504 --> 00:23:40.330\nlet me get out terminal here and\ngo back to this menu.\n\n468\n00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.110\nWhen I'm back here in this menu,\nI can choose to reinstall OS X and\n\n469\n00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:47.680\nwhen I do it, it's gonna start\nthat installation process.\n\n470\n00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.160\nAnd it's starting it via the Internet,\n\n471\n00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.990\nso I'm not gonna notice\na big difference visually.\n\n472\n00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.943\nAlthough I might see\nan extra verification step.\n\n473\n00:23:53.943 --> 00:23:57.240\nWhat I'm really gonna notice,\nthough, is the difference time wise.\n\n474\n00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.348\nIt's slow, it's gotta download\nthe whole thing from the Internet.\n\n475\n00:24:00.348 --> 00:24:04.830\nAnd if If something big just\nhappened at Apple, like yesterday.\n\n476\n00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:10.190\nYesterday they just announced a whole new\nline of products from Apple and IOS 9.3.\n\n477\n00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:13.820\nI'm gonna date this episode, so\nIOS 9.3 went live last night.\n\n478\n00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.540\nSo a ton of people are downloading\nstuff from Apple today.\n\n479\n00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.880\nSo this install is gonna take longer\nthan it would on a day when Apple hadn't\n\n480\n00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.690\nannounced anything.\n\n481\n00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.890\nSo it's pulling from their systems,\nand they do get a bit overloaded.\n\n482\n00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.930\nSo when I launch this it gives me a little\npopup, and it says, to download and\n\n483\n00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:33.400\nrestore OS X, your computer's\neligibility will be verified with Apple.\n\n484\n00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.780\nWhat do they mean by that?\n\n485\n00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:40.040\nWell, you're booting off of hardware\nthat doesn't already have OS X on it.\n\n486\n00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.320\nAnd Apple knows they ship\neverything with OS X on it.\n\n487\n00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.540\nSo you must be running\na non-legit computer, right?\n\n488\n00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.920\nLike a Hackintosh.\n\n489\n00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.670\nWell, not necessarily.\n\n490\n00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:50.120\nYou could be legit, and\nwe just need to prove that.\n\n491\n00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.740\nAnd so\nthat's what it's warning me about there,\n\n492\n00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.800\nis I'm gonna have to prove who I am.\n\n493\n00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.230\nAnd it can talk to Apple, so\none of the ways it can prove that\n\n494\n00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.500\nI'm okay to have this is that I\ncan provide it with my Apple ID.\n\n495\n00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:06.350\nAnd if it's got my Apple ID, it'll know\nthat we're okay, and that it'll install.\n\n496\n00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.500\nOr it can run the serial number from my\nunit, which it must've run the serial\n\n497\n00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.650\nnumber on this one, because it didn't\nprompt me for my Apple ID login.\n\n498\n00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.720\nBut now I can do my install, and\nI can choose that hard drive.\n\n499\n00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.900\nAnd I can start that installation and\n\n500\n00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.260\nit's gonna perform the installation\ndownloading the entire OS from Apple.\n\n501\n00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.550\nAgain, it's gonna be slow, but\nif I don't have a removable media,\n\n502\n00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.110\nif I didn't plan ahead for this,\nthen I'm okay cuz it's gonna download.\n\n503\n00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.840\nNow one word of caution,\nwhen it downloads the OS,\n\n504\n00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.410\nit's gonna download whatever\nOS the device shipped with.\n\n505\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.550\nSo if my device shipped with Yosemite,\nit's gonna download Yosemite,\n\n506\n00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.400\neven though El Capitan is out.\n\n507\n00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.870\nAnd so once it's got it installed,\nI might have to do an upgrade.\n\n508\n00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.740\nAnd I don't really remember what this,\n\n509\n00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.290\nit's kinda written right there really big\non the screen, if I'd just pay attention.\n\n510\n00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.820\nSee how it says, OS X Yosemite.\n\n511\n00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.480\nWell, this is an El Capitan show.\n\n512\n00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.800\nWell, it doesn't matter,\nthis Mac Mini shipped with Yosemite, and\n\n513\n00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.000\nthat's what Internet Recovery\nis gonna install.\n\n514\n00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.760\nIf I launch my installer,\nI can install El Capitan.\n\n515\n00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.720\nBut here it's gonna go to Yosemite cuz\nthat's what this machine shipped with.\n\n516\n00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.250\nSo that's basically recovery.\n\n517\n00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.540\nIt says about 1 hour and\n12 minutes remaining.\n\n518\n00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.970\nIf you remember from the screens earlier,\nmy other one said 12 minutes remaining.\n\n519\n00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:17.240\nThat's the difference between downloading\nversus having it on local media.\n\n520\n00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.490\nAll right, well Wes, I think that\nis a pretty good wrap of recovery.\n\n521\n00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.330\nWe are gonna see more stuff, I know I\nmentioned the hardware diagnostic mode,\n\n522\n00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:26.240\nwe're gonna see that in\nthe troubleshooting episode.\n\n523\n00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.940\nWe're also gonna see some other neat\nutilities in the troubleshooting episode.\n\n524\n00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.600\nYou'll definitely wanna check those out.\n\n525\n00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.920\nBut as far as recovery, those are the kind\nof the key things we need to know.\n\n526\n00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.290\n>> Al right,\ngood information as we continue on in our\n\n527\n00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.090\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n528\n00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:40.010\nDon, do you got anything else for\nus in this episode?\n\n529\n00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.870\n>> That's about it, Wes.\n\n530\n00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:42.040\nI think it's time for us to rap it up.\n\n531\n00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:42.920\n>> All right, very good.\n\n532\n00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.350\nWell, we're gonna go ahead\nsign out here at IT Pro TV.\n\n533\n00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:46.930\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n534\n00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:47.910\n>> And, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n535\n00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:49.830\n>> And, we'll see

00:00:18.930\nI'm your host Wes Brian, and in today's\nepisode we're gonna be moving through our\n\n4\n00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.070\nApple certified support professional.\n\n5\n00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.710\nNow we've got our OS 10 installed,\nnow we need to do configuration.\n\n6\n00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.270\nWe've got Don Pizet here to help us out.\n\n7\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.380\nDon, how are you doing today sir?\n\n8\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.301\n>> I'm doing great Wes, ready to get\nthis thing configured and up and\n\n9\n00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:31.043\nrunning for us.\n\n10\n00:00:31.043 --> 00:00:35.886\nNow when you get, I'm an IT guy,\nI get a new computer pretty freakingly\n\n11\n00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:39.870\nevery two years or so, and\nit's always a big event for me.\n\n12\n00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.268\nI'm always excited to get that new\nhardware and I'm also somewhat,\n\n13\n00:00:45.268 --> 00:00:50.493\nI'm excited, and yet I'm also a little,\nwhat's the word here?\n\n14\n00:00:50.493 --> 00:00:51.364\n>> Torn.\n\n15\n00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:55.750\n>> Yeah, because my old computer is\nset up exactly the way that I want it.\n\n16\n00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.290\nIt's got everything configured,\nall my applications.\n\n17\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.060\nAnd now I'm going to a new computer,\nI have to start out from scratch.\n\n18\n00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.998\nAnd for me, it can take a good couple\nof days before I get that laptop, or\n\n19\n00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:09.217\nget that desktop configured to meet my\nneeds, and set up the way that I want.\n\n20\n00:01:09.217 --> 00:01:10.157\nIt's a lot of work.\n\n21\n00:01:10.157 --> 00:01:11.560\nAnd so sometimes I don't like that.\n\n22\n00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.970\nBut you hear people where they say,\n\n23\n00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.690\nI'm not gonna upgrade because my\ncomputer is exactly the way I want it.\n\n24\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.980\nBut they might have this old,\nterrible computer that's falling apart and\n\n25\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.680\nthey really need to upgrade,\nbut they don't want to.\n\n26\n00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.400\nSo Apple tries to help with that.\n\n27\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.000\nWhen you get a new computer you've got to\ndo an initial configuration, and there's\n\n28\n00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.780\na lot of little systems we've gotta tweak\nto get us set exactly the way we want.\n\n29\n00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.310\nWe're gonna see those here in this series.\n\n30\n00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.185\nBut they actually make it easier for\n\n31\n00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:40.260\nyou to grab all the stuff off of your old\ncomputer and bring it onto the new one.\n\n32\n00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.698\nSo in the last episode, I mentioned just\nvery briefly the Migration Assistant, and\n\n33\n00:01:44.698 --> 00:01:48.009\nhow we can use the Migration Assistant\nto upgrade our system but\n\n34\n00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.620\nstill have a clean install underneath.\n\n35\n00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.270\nWell that's not really what\nthe tool was intended for.\n\n36\n00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.068\nI mean it certainly looks that way,\nlike I demonstrated.\n\n37\n00:01:55.068 --> 00:01:59.638\nBut what it is really intended for,\nis when you get an all new computer.\n\n38\n00:01:59.638 --> 00:02:02.130\nNot just formatting the one that you're\non, but you get an all new computer.\n\n39\n00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.130\nSo I buy a new MacBook Pro, or a IMac, or\nwhatever, and I wanna get my data from my\n\n40\n00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.487\nold system on a new one, and\na Migration Assistant can do that for us.\n\n41\n00:02:11.487 --> 00:02:16.158\nNow the Migration Assistant does a great\njob when you're moving data from Mac to\n\n42\n00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:17.770\nMac, it's easy, right?\n\n43\n00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.590\nThe systems are configured the same way,\nit just has to copy your data over,\n\n44\n00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.530\nand you're in business.\n\n45\n00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.900\nBut the Migration Assistant can also\nhelp us move from Windows to Mac.\n\n46\n00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.851\nSo if I have a Windows machine,\na Microsoft Windows machine, and\n\n47\n00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:34.140\nit's set up exactly the way I want,\nI've got all sorts of data on there.\n\n48\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.443\nI can use the Migration Assistant to grab\nmy data and bring it over, all right?\n\n49\n00:02:38.443 --> 00:02:40.020\nSo, let's take a look at that.\n\n50\n00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.040\nWhat I've got here on my laptop is\njust a base and solid El Capitan.\n\n51\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.456\nSo, I did the install, I gave it\nmy username and that's it, right?\n\n52\n00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:50.730\nOtherwise this is completely stock,\nI haven't customize anything.\n\n53\n00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.360\nIf I launch Safari and\nI go into Safari and\n\n54\n00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.300\nI take look at my favorites,\nwell I see iCloud,\n\n55\n00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.710\nGoogle, Bing, Wikipedia, right, these\nare the default ones that they give us.\n\n56\n00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.175\nTripAdvisor, Weather Channel, right,\nthose are the ones they come with.\n\n57\n00:03:09.175 --> 00:03:10.330\nBut what about my favorites?\n\n58\n00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.990\nWell, I don't know about you Wes, but\n\n59\n00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.190\nif you pull up the favorites on my\ncomputer I've got over 400 favorites that\n\n60\n00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.390\nI've acquired over the last few years and\nI would hate to lose those.\n\n61\n00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.465\nI wanna bring those over and\nget them in Safari.\n\n62\n00:03:21.465 --> 00:03:23.930\nOr, what about my documents?\n\n63\n00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.239\nSo, if I go in to my Documents folder,\n\n64\n00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.940\nmaybe I've gotta bunch of\ndocuments on my little computer.\n\n65\n00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.280\nI don't have anything here.\n\n66\n00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.572\nNone of those documents are here.\n\n67\n00:03:32.572 --> 00:03:35.241\nCuz it's a brand new computer,\nit's what I expect.\n\n68\n00:03:35.241 --> 00:03:37.450\nBut on my old computer\nI've got all this stuff.\n\n69\n00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.067\nSo if I jump over here, let's say my old\ncomputer is this Windows 10 machine.\n\n70\n00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:45.285\nAnd so in Windows 10, if I go into\nmy documents I've got a form letter,\n\n71\n00:03:45.285 --> 00:03:50.680\nsome instructions, a resume, these\nare documents that I've been working on.\n\n72\n00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.810\nAnd if I go into Internet Explorer.\n\n73\n00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.170\nAnd I go into my favorites,\nI've got CNN, Fox News, Reuters,\n\n74\n00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.240\nEngadget, Slashdot, couple of\nbookmarks there that I've built up.\n\n75\n00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.170\nI wanna get those and\nbring them over to my Mac.\n\n76\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.120\nAnd I want it to be painless.\n\n77\n00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.160\nI don't wanna have to go through\na huge setup on my own, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.065\nWell the Migration Assistant can help us.\n\n79\n00:04:11.065 --> 00:04:15.241\nIt can reach out to your old computer,\nwhether it's a Mac or a PC, and\n\n80\n00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:19.778\nit can bring those settings over and\nget them loaded into your new machine.\n\n81\n00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:21.770\nSo let's do the hardest one first.\n\n82\n00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:22.780\nWindows to Mac, right?\n\n83\n00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.780\nCuz the systems are completely different.\n\n84\n00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.821\nMac to Mac, we're just copying data,\nthat's easy.\n\n85\n00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:30.644\nWindows to Mac we've gotta get\nfavorites out of Internet Explorer and\n\n86\n00:04:30.644 --> 00:04:31.890\nput them into Safari.\n\n87\n00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.840\nI mean, you've got to change complete\nprograms for a lot of this stuff.\n\n88\n00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.958\nIt's a lot of work.\n\n89\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.630\nFortunately Apple makes it pretty easy for\nus.\n\n90\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.315\nStarting on the Mac side,\nstart on your new computer.\n\n91\n00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.824\nSo on your new computer what\nyou're gonna do is you're gonna\n\n92\n00:04:44.824 --> 00:04:46.260\nlaunch the Migration Assistant.\n\n93\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.474\nAnd I normally just use the Spotlight to\nfind it, if you launch your Spotlight and\n\n94\n00:04:49.474 --> 00:04:51.281\ntype migration, it's gonna turn right up.\n\n95\n00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:53.572\nBut if you wanna find\nit on your hard drive,\n\n96\n00:04:53.572 --> 00:04:57.020\nit's in your Applications folder\nunder the Utilities folder.\n\n97\n00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.470\nSo if I go into Applications and\n\n98\n00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.340\nthen I go into Utilities, the Migration\nAssistant is buried right in there.\n\n99\n00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.948\nAnd so we can launch that guy and get it\nfired up and we can start our migration.\n\n100\n00:05:07.948 --> 00:05:12.629\nNow it's gonna tell you that you can\ntransfer from Mac to Mac, right?\n\n101\n00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.204\nBut also Windows PC, and that's the one\nthat I'm gonna do right here for\n\n102\n00:05:16.204 --> 00:05:17.670\nthis first example.\n\n103\n00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.686\nSo when I move forward,\nI do need to be administrator,\n\n104\n00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:25.163\nbecause it's gonna be altering settings\nunder the hood, if I know my password.\n\n105\n00:05:25.163 --> 00:05:26.340\nThere we go.\n\n106\n00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.610\nAnd once it's done,\nsee how it's logging me out of Mac OS?\n\n107\n00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.640\nThe reason it's doing that is it's\ngotta move into a single user mode.\n\n108\n00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.800\nThere can't be any programs\nrunning while this happens.\n\n109\n00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.100\nBecause if there's a program running,\nit might be locking files and\n\n110\n00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.250\nthen we can't overwrite them.\n\n111\n00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.793\nAnd we need to be able to overwrite them.\n\n112\n00:05:41.793 --> 00:05:44.710\nSo it's kicking me out,\nit's logging me out of my brand-new Mac.\n\n113\n00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.210\nBut that's okay cuz there's\nnothing on my new Mac.\n\n114\n00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.730\nAnd then I can tell it\nhow I wanna migrate.\n\n115\n00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.911\nAnd I can choose,\nam I migrating from another Mac?\n\n116\n00:05:52.911 --> 00:05:56.120\nOr am I migrating from a Windows PC,\nor am I migrating to another Mac?\n\n117\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.775\nTo another Mac.\n\n118\n00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:00.917\nIf this was the source machine,\nthe one that had all my data,\n\n119\n00:06:00.917 --> 00:06:02.185\nI would choose that bottom option.\n\n120\n00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:05.017\nIf I was going Mac to Mac,\nI would choose this bottom option and\n\n121\n00:06:05.017 --> 00:06:06.850\nI'm going to another Mac.\n\n122\n00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.020\nBut in this case, this is my new Mac.\n\n123\n00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.150\nThis is the target.\n\n124\n00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.444\nAnd I'm coming from a WIndows PC, so\nI'm gonna choose that, from a Windows PC.\n\n125\n00:06:15.444 --> 00:06:20.062\nAnd then when I hit continue, it's now\ngonna tell me that it's looking for\n\n126\n00:06:20.062 --> 00:06:24.620\na Windows machine on my network, and\nit's telling me how to get started.\n\n127\n00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.873\nNow if I jump over to the Windows machine,\nand I try and\n\n128\n00:06:27.873 --> 00:06:31.213\nrun the Migration Assistant,\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n129\n00:06:31.213 --> 00:06:32.810\nIt's not gonna run.\n\n130\n00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.580\nBelieve it or not,\nMicrosoft does not package\n\n131\n00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.740\nApple's Migration Assistant\nwith their operating system.\n\n132\n00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.670\nThey don't want you to move to a Mac.\n\n133\n00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.455\nSo we've gotta go and\ndownload it and install it, and\n\n134\n00:06:41.455 --> 00:06:43.292\nthat's what these instructions\nare telling me here.\n\n135\n00:06:43.292 --> 00:06:50.930\nThey're saying, go to your Windows machine\nand browse to apple.com/migrate-2-mac.\n\n136\n00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.769\nAnd so I'm gonna do that,\nlet me jump over to my Windows machine and\n\n137\n00:06:56.769 --> 00:07:04.403\nI'll fire up a web browser and I'm gonna\nbrowse to www.apple.com/migratetomac.\n\n138\n00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:07.839\nAnd when I browse to that URL, it's\ngonna take me to this page where I can\n\n139\n00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:10.900\ndownload the Migration Assistant,\nthe latest version of it.\n\n140\n00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.358\nYou always wanna get\nthe latest version of it.\n\n141\n00:07:12.358 --> 00:07:16.330\nEvery time they release a new version of\nMac OS,so like when Yosemite came out or\n\n142\n00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.550\nEl Capitan comes out, they update\nthe Migration Assistant to support it.\n\n143\n00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.548\nBut they also have to update it when\nnew versions of Windows comes out.\n\n144\n00:07:23.548 --> 00:07:28.203\nAnd so notice here how it says it\nsupports migrating from Windows XP,\n\n145\n00:07:28.203 --> 00:07:31.290\nWindows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8.\n\n146\n00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.780\nWindows 10 is not on the list, and\n\n147\n00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.621\nso technically I'm about to do\na migration that's not supported.\n\n148\n00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.615\nI'm gonna migrate data from\na Windows 10 machine and\n\n149\n00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:39.270\nthat's not in their official support list.\n\n150\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.740\nWe can work around it pretty easy,\nI'll show you that in a minute.\n\n151\n00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.815\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and download that.\n\n152\n00:07:43.815 --> 00:07:46.925\nAnd we'll run that installer.\n\n153\n00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:51.453\nAnd we're gonna install Apple's Migration\nAssistant here on our Windows machine.\n\n154\n00:07:51.453 --> 00:07:54.043\nAnd we need this and, actually it looks\nlike I've already got it installed.\n\n155\n00:07:54.043 --> 00:07:54.963\nSo I'll just choose repair.\n\n156\n00:07:54.963 --> 00:07:57.757\nBut if you don't have it installed,\nyou just hit Next twice and\n\n157\n00:07:57.757 --> 00:07:59.721\nit goes, here I'll hit Repair and it goes.\n\n158\n00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:02.440\nSo it is not like you have\nto make any decisions here.\n\n159\n00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.290\nYou're just installing the assistant.\n\n160\n00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.440\nOnce it's installed,\nit's now ready to launch.\n\n161\n00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.460\nWe can fire it up, and\nget moved over to our nice new Mac.\n\n162\n00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.720\nSo I'm going to bring up\nmy start menu here and\n\n163\n00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.090\nsometimes it shows up automatically in\nthe start menu here, this time it didn't.\n\n164\n00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.270\n>> Don, we had a good question\nthat comes from the chat room.\n\n165\n00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.250\nSo I'm gonna go and\ninterrupt you here and ask you.\n\n166\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.280\nCan we migrate from the Linux to Mac?\n\n167\n00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.600\n>> Yeah, good question,\ncuz we, I mentioned Mac to Mac,\n\n168\n00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.270\nI mentioned Windows to Mac.\n\n169\n00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.310\nBut not Linux to Mac and unfortunately\nApple doesn't have a Linux to Mac.\n\n170\n00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:38.220\nI know under the hood, Mac OS is\nrunning BSD, BSD is a Unix variant.\n\n171\n00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.537\nLinux is a Unix-like operating system.\n\n172\n00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:45.672\nThey're very similar under the hood, but\nthe big problem is Unix distributions,\n\n173\n00:08:45.672 --> 00:08:46.211\nright,?\n\n174\n00:08:46.211 --> 00:08:47.510\nI'm sorry, Linux distributions.\n\n175\n00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.550\nSo if you have Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu,\n\n176\n00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.270\nall of these different distros, they\nstore their stuff in different places.\n\n177\n00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.461\nAnd the desktop market share for\nLinux is so\n\n178\n00:08:56.461 --> 00:09:00.991\nsmall that they just haven't\nmade a migration utility for.\n\n179\n00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:02.842\nSo if you wanna bring your\ndata over from those,\n\n180\n00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:05.260\nyou're gonna do it manually\nwhich means copying your files.\n\n181\n00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.282\nIt means going to your web browser and\nexporting your favorites list,\n\n182\n00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:13.863\nit means having to document your settings\nand then going and recreating those.\n\n183\n00:09:13.863 --> 00:09:16.237\nIt's a lot of work and\nit's just unfortunate that's how it is and\n\n184\n00:09:16.237 --> 00:09:17.700\nit's all based on market share.\n\n185\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.350\nI mean you see Apple, they do a pretty\ngood job with the Migration Assistant.\n\n186\n00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.790\nThey assume your coming from\nan older computer to a newer one and\n\n187\n00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.340\nthat's why they're not like in a big\nhurry to create that Windows 10\n\n188\n00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.160\nMigration Assistant,\ncuz Windows 10 is fairly new,.\n\n189\n00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.290\nBut they deal with the older versions of\nWindows cuz that's the likely migration\n\n190\n00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:32.870\npath for them.\n\n191\n00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.828\nThey just don't, they don't do Linux yet.\n\n192\n00:09:34.828 --> 00:09:39.091\nThey might one day, it is growing\nevery year, that Linux market share.\n\n193\n00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:40.149\nAll right, so let's see,\n\n194\n00:09:40.149 --> 00:09:43.051\nI was just about to launch migration\nassisting here on my Windows machine.\n\n195\n00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:47.468\nSo on the Windows machine, if I dive\ninto my all apps and hunt down in here,\n\n196\n00:09:47.468 --> 00:09:51.625\nI should have the Windows Migration\nAssistant, there it is, okay.\n\n197\n00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:54.590\nNow, I'm gonna have to do\nsomething a little different.\n\n198\n00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.900\nIf I were on Windows 7, or Windows 8,\nWindows Vista, Windows XP,\n\n199\n00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.290\nI could just launch this and\nwe're gonna be in business.\n\n200\n00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:04.790\nOkay, but I know Windows 10 and\nWindows 10 is not officially supported yet\n\n201\n00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.370\nby the Migration Assistant.\n\n202\n00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:12.547\nSo I'm gonna actually have to make a quick\nchange to that file, so that it'll run.\n\n203\n00:10:12.547 --> 00:10:16.640\nAnd what I'm gonna do I'm gonna use\nWindows compatibility mode just to tell to\n\n204\n00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.262\nrun as if it were on Windows 8.\n\n205\n00:10:18.262 --> 00:10:19.758\nAnd so that's what I got set right here,\n\n206\n00:10:19.758 --> 00:10:21.828\nrun this program in compatibility mode for\nWindows 8.\n\n207\n00:10:21.828 --> 00:10:27.043\nAnd that way it'll run, so\nif you're migrating from Windows XP,\n\n208\n00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:30.260\nVista, 7, or 8, it runs just fine.\n\n209\n00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.780\nDon't worry,\nthose are officially supported by Apple.\n\n210\n00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.268\nIf you're doing 10, you just have\nto put it in compatibility mode.\n\n211\n00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:38.228\nAnd then when I run it, it's gonna run and\n\n212\n00:10:38.228 --> 00:10:41.874\nit's gonna leverage\nApple's Bonjour protocol.\n\n213\n00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:42.417\nAnd Bonjour,\n\n214\n00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:45.540\nit's our great protocol because it\nrequires next to no configuration.\n\n215\n00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.950\nIt just reaches out on the network,\nand it looks for other systems.\n\n216\n00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.760\nAnd so, it's telling me hey, this is gonna\nmake it easy to migrate your settings.\n\n217\n00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.280\nAnd I can just hit Continue,\nand it's gonna tell me,\n\n218\n00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.510\nif Windows Updates are configured to be\nautomatic, we might wanna turn that off.\n\n219\n00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.760\nBecause Windows machines\nautomatically update and then reboot,\n\n220\n00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.180\nand you don't wanna rebooting in\nthe middle of the Migration Assistant.\n\n221\n00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.650\nSo if you need to, you can go and\nturn the automatic updates off.\n\n222\n00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.602\nIf you just did updates then you'll likely\nfind you don't have to worry about it and\n\n223\n00:11:11.602 --> 00:11:12.583\nyou can continue forward.\n\n224\n00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:14.737\nBut they're just kind\nof warning you there.\n\n225\n00:11:14.737 --> 00:11:18.300\nAnd then, now it's looking on\na network for a Mac, okay?\n\n226\n00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.050\nIt's scanning the network and\ntrying to find a Mac.\n\n227\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:26.480\nWell, I've got a Mac, right here and\nit found the Windows machine.\n\n228\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.560\nAnd so, I can see it right here,\nWIN-CLIENT01,\n\n229\n00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.450\nit found that client on the network.\n\n230\n00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.760\nAnd it's looking for other sources, cuz I\nmight be migrating more than one machine.\n\n231\n00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.933\nI might see five different machines here,\ndepending on what it is we're doing.\n\n232\n00:11:37.933 --> 00:11:41.978\nSo it's looking and\nit found this WIN-CLIENT01, okay?\n\n233\n00:11:41.978 --> 00:11:47.236\nNow I need to choose that as my source and\nthen down here, I'm ready to continue\n\n234\n00:11:47.236 --> 00:11:52.030\nforward and when I continue forward,\nit's gonna generate this code.\n\n235\n00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.770\nNow why is it generating that code?\n\n236\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.160\nWell, I know that this says WIN-CLIENT01,\nand my Windows machine,\n\n237\n00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.740\nthat's the name of the Windows machine,\nWIN-CLIENT01.\n\n238\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.750\nBut couldn't a hacker like fire\nup the Migration Assistant,\n\n239\n00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.700\nor maybe not even a hacker,\n\n240\n00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:11.000\nmaybe just Sally down in accounting fires\nup the Migration Assistant for fun.\n\n241\n00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.380\nAnd then, all of a sudden,\nshe sees my machine on the network.\n\n242\n00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.610\nCouldn't she get a copy of all my data?\n\n243\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.220\nAbsolutely, if she could get connected to\nmy machine she can pull all that data down\n\n244\n00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.900\nand now she's got all my documents.\n\n245\n00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.490\nI don't want that, right?\n\n246\n00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:29.010\nSo before you start the migration what it\ndoes, is it generates a code on the screen\n\n247\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:33.400\nand you look at that code and\nyou compare it to the other machine.\n\n248\n00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.680\nIf the codes don't match, then you're\nconnected to somebody else's computer, and\n\n249\n00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.690\nyou need to cancel the wizard.\n\n250\n00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.320\nYou're about to send your data\nto the wrong place, okay?\n\n251\n00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.900\nIf the codes do match,\nthen you're good to go.\n\n252\n00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.660\nYou're connected to the right one and\nyou're ready to transmit, all right?\n\n253\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.244\nThe two machines do need to be able\nto see each other on the network,\n\n254\n00:12:49.244 --> 00:12:50.999\nthey need to be on the same\nwireless network or\n\n255\n00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:53.512\nthe same wired network in order for\nthem to discover each other.\n\n256\n00:12:53.512 --> 00:12:56.321\nIf there's a router in between them,\nthey're not gonna find each other, right?\n\n257\n00:12:56.321 --> 00:12:59.285\nBut we need them to see it and\nthen as long as those codes match,\n\n258\n00:12:59.285 --> 00:13:00.205\nwe're good to go.\n\n259\n00:13:00.205 --> 00:13:02.366\nNow, on the Mac side,\nit's given me the code, and\n\n260\n00:13:02.366 --> 00:13:05.100\nit's telling me to jump over to\nthe other computer to continue.\n\n261\n00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:09.560\nSo I'll do that, and on this one I'm just\ngonna hit Continue and there it goes.\n\n262\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.700\nIt's gathering my settings, well, actually\nit's discovering my settings right now and\n\n263\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.420\nthen it's gonna ask me to pick and\nchoose what I wanna send.\n\n264\n00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.490\nSo see how it says, the assistant is ready\nto transfer your information on your Mac,\n\n265\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.300\nchoose what you want to transfer.\n\n266\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:28.160\nSo I gotta go back to the Mac and\nnow, I get to pick what we want.\n\n267\n00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.420\nI got a slight problem.\n\n268\n00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:33.360\nWhen I set up my new Mac,\nI already created a user called Don Pezet.\n\n269\n00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.250\nOn the Windows machine,\nI've got a user called Don Pezet.\n\n270\n00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.140\nIt wants to bring that user over.\n\n271\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.668\nI've already got a user with that name.\n\n272\n00:13:38.668 --> 00:13:40.510\nSo it's gonna ask me to\nchange that name and\n\n273\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.630\nI'll see that on the next screen but,\ninside of there, I can pick what I want.\n\n274\n00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.940\nDo I want my Music,\nmy Pictures, my Desktop,\n\n275\n00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.840\nmy Downloads, my Bookmarks, right?\n\n276\n00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.590\nMy system settings,\nlike screen saver time outs.\n\n277\n00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.641\nDoes it wanna bring those over?\n\n278\n00:13:53.641 --> 00:13:56.683\nI can pick and\nchoose what all I wanna bring over and,\n\n279\n00:13:56.683 --> 00:13:58.771\nother files on the C drive, right?\n\n280\n00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:00.812\nIt's gonna get shared files and\nperformance logs and\n\n281\n00:14:00.812 --> 00:14:02.710\nother things I might have on the system.\n\n282\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.200\nIt's gonna get all of this to\nbring over to my new system.\n\n283\n00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.730\nAnd when I move forward, now it's gonna\nask what I wanna do about the name, right?\n\n284\n00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.714\nDo I wanna keep both accounts or\ndo I wanna replace and\n\n285\n00:14:13.714 --> 00:14:15.330\nsay I can't choose replace.\n\n286\n00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.340\nLet's say,\nI'm logged in as Don Pezet right now.\n\n287\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.930\nSince I'm logged in as the user,\nI can't replace it.\n\n288\n00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.765\nI'd need to log in as a different\nuser if I wanted that.\n\n289\n00:14:21.765 --> 00:14:26.326\nSo I'll just need to give it a new name,\nso I'll call this like, I don't know\n\n290\n00:14:26.326 --> 00:14:31.043\nlet's just say it's Wes' new computer so\nI'll make it Wes Bryan, all right.\n\n291\n00:14:31.043 --> 00:14:34.780\nAnd so this is gonna be Wes' new account.\n\n292\n00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.350\nAnd so, I'll Continue with that.\n\n293\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.970\nThe easier solution would\nhave been to rename the local\n\n294\n00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.180\naccount that way I could create a new one\ncalled Don Pezet but we'll run with this.\n\n295\n00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:47.010\nSo that's it and\nnow it's grabbing data off my old Mac.\n\n296\n00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:51.210\nAnd my old Windows machine and\nbringing it over to the new Mac.\n\n297\n00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.618\nIt's grabbing my files, my folders.\n\n298\n00:14:53.618 --> 00:14:57.330\nIt's grabbing my Internet Explorer\nfavorites and it's bringing them over and\n\n299\n00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.640\ndepositing them right here.\n\n300\n00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.160\nThe more data you have,\nthe longer this is gonna take, but\n\n301\n00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.140\nthis is gonna save you a ton\nof time in that initial setup.\n\n302\n00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.700\nAll that time we dread like we gotta\nget through the customizable stuff\n\n303\n00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.810\nIt's gonna customize it for me.\n\n304\n00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:15.200\nAnd so now that it's done,\nit's gonna take me to the login screen and\n\n305\n00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.390\nI've got a new user called Wes Bryan\nbecause that's what I chose.\n\n306\n00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.160\nAnd if I go and login as him, well,\nhe doesn't have a password so\n\n307\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.920\nit's making me pick a new password for\nhim.\n\n308\n00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.810\nAnd in standard Wes style I'm\ngonna pick something super secure.\n\n309\n00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:29.500\n>> There we go.\n\n310\n00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.113\n>> Like the word password, all lower case.\n\n311\n00:15:31.113 --> 00:15:32.008\n>> Perfect.\n\n312\n00:15:32.008 --> 00:15:35.382\n>> And [LAUGH] so we'll get that set, and\nnow I'll be able to log in as Wes, and\n\n313\n00:15:35.382 --> 00:15:38.390\nhe's gonna have all the settings\nfrom my other computer.\n\n314\n00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.550\nSo when this gets logged in,\nI might not notice anything too different.\n\n315\n00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.868\nI'll still have my Yosemite wallpaper.\n\n316\n00:15:42.868 --> 00:15:46.966\nIt doesn't like to bring the Windows\nwallpaper over, cuz it's,\n\n317\n00:15:46.966 --> 00:15:48.438\nMicrosoft wall paper.\n\n318\n00:15:48.438 --> 00:15:53.348\nBut we can jump in, and what I should\nsee Is that Wes's Documents folder?\n\n319\n00:15:53.348 --> 00:15:55.338\nHe's got my documents\nfrom the Windows machine.\n\n320\n00:15:55.338 --> 00:15:56.606\nAnd when he launches Safari,\n\n321\n00:15:56.606 --> 00:15:59.230\nhe should have my bookmarks\nfrom the Windows machine.\n\n322\n00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.010\nAll that stuff is following over, so\nhe is not starting from scratch anymore?\n\n323\n00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.564\nAll right, he is not saying,\nI lost all my settings.\n\n324\n00:16:04.564 --> 00:16:08.710\nHe is coming in and saying, all right\nwell let me jump into my documents and\n\n325\n00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.620\nsure enough, there's my stuff.\n\n326\n00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.580\nThere's my form letter, my instructions.\n\n327\n00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.340\nSo if I fire up that form monitor,\nthere it is.\n\n328\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.510\nAnd he's ready to work.\n\n329\n00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:24.020\nAnd if he jumps into Safari, and we get in\nhere, and he goes into a Safari bookmarks.\n\n330\n00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.600\nI had a nice little folder here called\nMigrated from Internet Explorer.\n\n331\n00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.330\nAnd there's all those settings.\n\n332\n00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:30.680\nWe can jump into /.\n\n333\n00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.650\nAnd read all the latest tech news,\nand there we go.\n\n334\n00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.070\nSo he got his information brought over and\nhe's in business.\n\n335\n00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.104\nThe migration system is really handy for\nthat, if we're going like this,\n\n336\n00:16:41.104 --> 00:16:42.130\nWindows to Mac.\n\n337\n00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:46.470\n>> Now you said settings Don, does it\ntake application specific settings?\n\n338\n00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.910\nI'm sure if you're going from Mac to Mac,\nyou're gonna find some similarities.\n\n339\n00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.790\nEven maybe if the versions\nare a little bit different but\n\n340\n00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.470\nas far as the application goes,\nthey're gonna be fairly similar but\n\n341\n00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.110\nwhat if you're going\nfrom Windows to Mac and\n\n342\n00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.900\nyou have something that maybe is\nWindows specific and not on Mac.\n\n343\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.030\n>> Yeah, it doesn't do those.\n\n344\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.950\nThose settings get left behind even if\nthey're really close like if I'm running\n\n345\n00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:08.390\nMicrosoft Word on the Windows machine and\nI'm running Microsoft Word on my Mac\n\n346\n00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.065\nthose two versions of Word\nare actually different.\n\n347\n00:17:10.065 --> 00:17:12.620\nTheyre not the same and so\none's specifically written for\n\n348\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.660\nthe Mac, and the settings don't come over.\n\n349\n00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.370\nSo any third party applications you have,\nthey likely don't run on the Mac anyway,\n\n350\n00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:20.450\nso you're gonna have to get\ndifferent applications, but\n\n351\n00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.308\nthose settings you'll have\nto bring over on your own.\n\n352\n00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:25.940\nBut the basis stuff, the stuff a regular\nend user needs, your web browser, and\n\n353\n00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.370\nyour files,\nthat stuff comes over just fine.\n\n354\n00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:31.860\nSome of the other customizations like your\nscreensaver time out those would come over\n\n355\n00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.000\ntoo and you end up with a system that\nis very similar to what you had but\n\n356\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.630\nnow it's in the Mac ecosystem.\n\n357\n00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.740\nSo that's basically\nthat migration process.\n\n358\n00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.440\nNow, obviously Apple wants you to\nmigrate from Windows to Mac and they\n\n359\n00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.280\nwant you to switch over to their products,\nso we're gonna have good support for that.\n\n360\n00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.140\nThey also want you to buy new Macs, and so\nas yours gets older it might be time for\n\n361\n00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.310\nyou to buy a new one.\n\n362\n00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:53.620\nAnd it's the same process as with Windows.\n\n363\n00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.210\nWe run the Migration Assistant\non our new Mac, and\n\n364\n00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.490\nthen we run the Migration Assistant\non our old Mac.\n\n365\n00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:04.480\nAnd the difference is,\nlike if I go back in here, on the new Mac,\n\n366\n00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.850\nwhat I chose Shoot.\n\n367\n00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:07.835\nYou're not an admin, are you?\n\n368\n00:18:07.835 --> 00:18:11.460\nI'll have to switch to me.\n\n369\n00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.280\nLet me get this launched here.\n\n370\n00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.490\nOn the new Mac what we want to do\n\n371\n00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.440\nis we want to choose that it's the source,\nright.\n\n372\n00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.000\nThat this is where the data is going to.\n\n373\n00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.200\nAnd we say that we are coming\nfrom our old Mac, right.\n\n374\n00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.850\nSo we choose that first\noption from an old Mac.\n\n375\n00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.420\nAnd then we go to our old Mac and\nwe launch the Migration Assistant there.\n\n376\n00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.480\nNow the old Mac likely already has\nthe Migration Assistant on it.\n\n377\n00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.550\nYou just need to make sure\nyou've done your updates.\n\n378\n00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.710\nAnd so on the old Mac you\nwould choose to another Mac.\n\n379\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:40.700\nAnd then it's gonna find it.\n\n380\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.820\nThe two Macs see each other and you get\na code number just like on the Windows\n\n381\n00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.210\nside and then you progress forward.\n\n382\n00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.680\nIt's really no different than on\nthe Windows side at that point.\n\n383\n00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.730\nSo that's another way to migrate.\n\n384\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.240\nThose are the two main ways that we\ncan use the migration assistant.\n\n385\n00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.710\nBoth of them require\nan active network connection.\n\n386\n00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:58.820\nAnd both of them require you to have\naccess to both computers at the same\n\n387\n00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.650\ntime, alright.\n\n388\n00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.350\nBut what if I don't have that?\n\n389\n00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.170\nWhat if I don't have them\non the same network, or\n\n390\n00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.770\nI don't have access to both machines?\n\n391\n00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.750\nOr what if one of the machines is broken?\n\n392\n00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.910\nRight, a bad memory or\nsomething like that.\n\n393\n00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.530\nAnd I can't I can't even\nboot it's operating system.\n\n394\n00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.000\nI just want to get my data off of it,\nright.\n\n395\n00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.670\nThat's were things get a little bit more\nchallenging, and there's two more modes\n\n396\n00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.510\ninside of the migration assistant\nthat can help us with those.\n\n397\n00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:28.170\nThe most useful one is this one right here\nthat we can migrate our settings from\n\n398\n00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.810\na time machine backup.\n\n399\n00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.940\nThe old computer can be completely dead.\n\n400\n00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.870\nWon't even power on.\n\n401\n00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.760\nBut if I have a Time Machine backup, like\non a removable drive, I can hook it up to\n\n402\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.270\nthis computer and I can choose that\nas where I want to get my data from.\n\n403\n00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.450\nSo I say from a Time Machine backup.\n\n404\n00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.140\nNow we don't have codes to worry about,\nwe don't have another computer.\n\n405\n00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.100\nIt just grabs the settings right\nout of the Time Machine backup.\n\n406\n00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:54.210\nThen it can get our documents,\nour settings, our Safari favorites and\n\n407\n00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.820\nget all that right out of the Time Machine\nbackup, so that's a great way to do it.\n\n408\n00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.740\nBut this last option's the one I wanna\ntalk about and that's startup disk.\n\n409\n00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.760\nWhat the heck is a startup disk?\n\n410\n00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:08.570\nWell if you have a Mac that's\ncompletely dead, you could rip the hard\n\n411\n00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:12.630\ndrive right out of it stick it in a USB\nslot and plug it onto this computer and\n\n412\n00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.610\nit will show as an alternate start up\ndisc and as long as the drive is still\n\n413\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:19.285\nfunctioning you can grab the data\nright off of that hard drive.\n\n414\n00:20:19.285 --> 00:20:22.750\nYou got the start up disc for\nthat other Mac.\n\n415\n00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.990\nBut the reality is on your newer Mac's,\nyou can't rip the hard drive's out.\n\n416\n00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:31.810\nSo for example, on the Mac mini's, prior\nto last year there was the big round disk.\n\n417\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.600\nI wonder if I can show this on camera.\n\n418\n00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.450\nThere was the big round\ndisk on the bottom of them.\n\n419\n00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:40.270\nThis black disk, and prior to last year,\nthere were two little finger holes here\n\n420\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.910\nand you could twist it and pop it off and\nthe hard drive was right there.\n\n421\n00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:43.480\nYou could take it out.\n\n422\n00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.990\nOn the newer ones like this one,\nnotice how there is no finger holes?\n\n423\n00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.910\nI can't twist this and open it.\n\n424\n00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.360\nYou can't open them anymore,\nI mean you can,\n\n425\n00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.090\nyou can open anything\nwith like a [INAUDIBLE].\n\n426\n00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.050\nBut you're not supposed to,\n\n427\n00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.250\nyou're not supposed to get\nthat hard drive out anymore.\n\n428\n00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.660\nAnd if you got an iMac, right.\n\n429\n00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.200\niMac, like iMac at home, I don't even\nwanna figure out how to open that thing,\n\n430\n00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.780\nthere is no visible screws on the outside,\nyou got like pop latches and glue and\n\n431\n00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.990\nall sort of stuff.\n\n432\n00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:10.360\nYou don't want to do that.\n\n433\n00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.880\nSo fortunately Apple makes it easy for\nus to get at the hard drive for\n\n434\n00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.810\nthese machines, without taking them out.\n\n435\n00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.690\nEvery Mac supports booting into\nwhat's called target mode.\n\n436\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.710\nWhen you power the Mac on you can\nhold the letter T on the keyboard and\n\n437\n00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:29.670\nwhen you do that it's gonna boot up,\nnot as a Mac, but as a hard drive.\n\n438\n00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.758\nAll right?\n\n439\n00:21:30.758 --> 00:21:34.458\nAnd once it boots up as a hard drive,\nyou can plug it into another computer, and\n\n440\n00:21:34.458 --> 00:21:36.169\nit'll just show up as a hard drive.\n\n441\n00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:38.990\nAnd that's when you're able to\nuse that start up disc option\n\n442\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.940\nto be able to load that data,\nstore it and bring it in, okay.\n\n443\n00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.260\nSo let me show you that.\n\n444\n00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.540\nI've got this Mac Mini\nthat is sitting over here.\n\n445\n00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.270\nI'm gonna have to switch over to it.\n\n446\n00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:52.180\nAnd once I switch over to it,\nthis is a Mac Mini that we used in some of\n\n447\n00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.210\nthe earlier episodes\nto install OS10 on it.\n\n448\n00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:58.010\nIf fact, I probably should have checked\nbefore the show to see if it was done\n\n449\n00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.300\ninstalling OS10 or not.\n\n450\n00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:05.710\nIt should be done by this point, but\nonce it's done, it's up it's running OS10.\n\n451\n00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.590\nBut I can boot it in target mode\nin order to access this data.\n\n452\n00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:13.950\nNow before I do that, to boot in target\nmode, you're gonna need one of two things.\n\n453\n00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.600\nOn newer Macs,\nthey have Thunderbolt ports.\n\n454\n00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.920\nAnd so\nyou're going to need a Thunderbolt cable.\n\n455\n00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.510\nAnd so I've got a Thunderbolt cable here.\n\n456\n00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.280\nNot a long one.\n\n457\n00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.300\nThis is like one meter long, maybe.\n\n458\n00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:27.140\nAnd it's an official\nApple Thunderbolt cable.\n\n459\n00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.380\nI say it's official.\n\n460\n00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.090\nThis one's actually made by Belkin.\n\n461\n00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:34.260\nIt's important that you have one\nthat is truly a Thunderbolt cable.\n\n462\n00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.730\nRemember the Thunderbolt cable\nconnectors look just like display port.\n\n463\n00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:42.260\nAnd you can get a display port to display\nport cable, for like five bucks but\n\n464\n00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.420\nit's not Thunderbolt.\n\n465\n00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.100\nOn a true Thunderbolt cable,\n\n466\n00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.160\nthere's actually some little logic chips\nin the connector, and so they're smart.\n\n467\n00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.970\nThey actually do more than\njust a display port cable, so\n\n468\n00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.020\nI have to have an official one.\n\n469\n00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:57.140\nAnd the official ones usually cost $35,\nthey're a lot more expensive, but\n\n470\n00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.110\nthey do a lot more.\n\n471\n00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.360\nSo if I wanna boot into target mode,\nand I wanna connect up via Thunderbolt,\n\n472\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.460\nI've gotta have a Thunderbolt cable.\n\n473\n00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:08.560\nOn an older Mac that doesn't have\nThunderbolt, you have fire wire.\n\n474\n00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.950\nSo you can use a fire wire cable instead.\n\n475\n00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.240\nThe process is the same,\nit's just a different cable.\n\n476\n00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.910\nProblem is on newer Macs,\nyou don't have fire wire ports anymore.\n\n477\n00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.680\nSo you may have to get some kind of\nadapter to get a fire wire port on\n\n478\n00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.740\nyour new Mac.\n\n479\n00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.590\nBut on your old Mac,\nyou would run fire wire to the system.\n\n480\n00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.270\nSo I'm going to either need\na fire wire cable or Thunderbolt.\n\n481\n00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.200\nThe one I've got is Thunderbolt.\n\n482\n00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.440\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna plug in\nthat Thunderbolt cable into my Mac Mini,\n\n483\n00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:37.410\nand I'm gonna plug that other end of\nit into my laptop here, my Macbook Pro,\n\n484\n00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:42.800\nand that way, I'll be able to login and\nactually get to see that drive.\n\n485\n00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.868\nAll right.\n\n486\n00:23:43.868 --> 00:23:45.850\nOkay good, so\nit looks like my install finished.\n\n487\n00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.298\nWe're up and running here and\nit's just a normal Mac.\n\n488\n00:23:48.298 --> 00:23:50.358\nI've plugged in that Thunderbolt cable.\n\n489\n00:23:50.358 --> 00:23:52.222\nI don't see any difference here,\n\n490\n00:23:52.222 --> 00:23:55.445\nit's just reading regular\nold OS 10 El Capitan, right.\n\n491\n00:23:55.445 --> 00:24:00.100\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna shut it\ndown, and once it's shut down, I'm gonna\n\n492\n00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:04.770\nreboot it, and I'm gonna boot it while\nholding the letter T on the keyboard.\n\n493\n00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.500\nHolding down the letter T boots\nus in what's called Target Mode.\n\n494\n00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.505\nAnd target mode is where it's not\na Mac anymore, it's a hard drive.\n\n495\n00:24:12.505 --> 00:24:14.030\nAnd that's exactly what I want.\n\n496\n00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.750\nI need it to just be a hard drive because\nthat's not gonna boot the operating\n\n497\n00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.420\nsystem, it's just gonna have\nthe drive available and\n\n498\n00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.810\nmake it available via the FireWire or\nThunderbolt port.\n\n499\n00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.290\nAnd it depends on your Mac\nwhich one it's going to be.\n\n500\n00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:26.573\nSo mine's Thunderbolt.\n\n501\n00:24:26.573 --> 00:24:30.232\nAnd the process is the same either way,\nso it doesn't really matter which one.\n\n502\n00:24:30.232 --> 00:24:33.041\nI'm gonna hold T on the keyboard and\nhit that power button, so\n\n503\n00:24:33.041 --> 00:24:34.800\nit's gonna start powering up.\n\n504\n00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.370\nAnd you'll know you did it right\nif when it starts to boot,\n\n505\n00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:43.020\ninstead of an Apple logo,\nyou get either the Thunderbolt icon or\n\n506\n00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.440\nyou get the FireWire icon,\none or the other, all right?\n\n507\n00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.340\nI got Thunderbolt,\ncuz that's why I got hooked up.\n\n508\n00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:55.080\nAnd as soon as it shows up as Thunderbolt,\nthen we can now have it on another system,\n\n509\n00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.210\nI can have it available and\neasy to access somewhere else.\n\n510\n00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.530\nAnd I can get at that data and\nwhatever it is that I need.\n\n511\n00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:05.920\nSo that's exactly what I wanted to do,\nand if I jump over to say,\n\n512\n00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.490\nhere I'll jump over to my other Mac.\n\n513\n00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.328\nLet me I don't wanna unplug\nmy Thunderbolt cable,\n\n514\n00:25:13.328 --> 00:25:15.930\n[LAUGH] that would mess this all up.\n\n515\n00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:20.150\nBut if I jump back over to my MacBook\nbefore when I hook the Thunderbolt cable\n\n516\n00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:22.530\nup, there was nothing new,\nthere was no difference.\n\n517\n00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.250\nBut now that I've hooked\nthe Thunderbolt cable up,\n\n518\n00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:30.280\nwhat you'll see is on my desktop,\nI've got my Macintosh HD.\n\n519\n00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.800\nAnd I've got another Macintosh HDM too.\n\n520\n00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.150\nOne is mine.\n\n521\n00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.760\nOne is the other one,\nthe one from the Mac Mini.\n\n522\n00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.200\nIt's an external drive and so\nit's showing up there right there,\n\n523\n00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.030\nMacintosh HD as an external drive.\n\n524\n00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.181\nAnd if I'm If I am not positive of that,\n\n525\n00:25:45.181 --> 00:25:47.735\nI can always go into my\ndisc utility to verify.\n\n526\n00:25:47.735 --> 00:25:52.890\nIf I go into my disc utility, what I'm\ngonna see in here is my internal drive.\n\n527\n00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:54.789\nThere's the Apple SSD that's in my laptop.\n\n528\n00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:56.426\nI've got a 500 gig disk.\n\n529\n00:25:56.426 --> 00:26:03.140\nThen my external Apple hard disk\ndrive 1TB that's the Mac Mini.\n\n530\n00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.510\nSo I'm now seeing both drives.\n\n531\n00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:10.460\nAnd the cool part here is, I can come in\nand I can launch the Migration Assistant.\n\n532\n00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.030\nAnd in the Migration Assistant,\n\n533\n00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.780\nwhen we move it forward, it's gonna do\nthat thing where it logs me out, right?\n\n534\n00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.070\nSo it's gonna log me out, some of my\nvirtual machines are gonna have to pause.\n\n535\n00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.150\nBut it's gonna log me out and\nonce I'm logged out it's gonna go into\n\n536\n00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:27.100\nthe Migration Assistant and\nwhen I go to pick a source for\n\n537\n00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.510\nmy migration, I can pick this Thunderbolt\nhard drive that's now attached.\n\n538\n00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.562\nI say Thunderbolt hard drive,\nit looks like a Mac Mini, but in reality,\n\n539\n00:26:34.562 --> 00:26:38.166\nit's a very, very expensive Thunderbolt\nhard drive that's just sitting here doing\n\n540\n00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:40.841\nabsolutely, nothing waiting for\nme to grab the data out of it.\n\n541\n00:26:40.841 --> 00:26:43.177\nSo I can say that I'm\nmigrating from a Mac and\n\n542\n00:26:43.177 --> 00:26:45.780\nI'm gonna be using the start\nup disc piece of it.\n\n543\n00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.328\nAnd when I continue forward,\nsee for the source,\n\n544\n00:26:48.328 --> 00:26:52.334\ninstead of scanning the network and\nlooking for Macs out there on the network,\n\n545\n00:26:52.334 --> 00:26:54.782\nit sees that Macintosh\nhard drive right there.\n\n546\n00:26:54.782 --> 00:26:58.880\nAnd I can pick it as the source,\nand I can migrate that data in.\n\n547\n00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.845\nAnd when I continue forward\nto start grabbing that data,\n\n548\n00:27:01.845 --> 00:27:06.042\nit's checking the disk to make sure it's\ngot good data on it that it can pull, and\n\n549\n00:27:06.042 --> 00:27:08.660\nthen it's gonna be ready\nto migrate that data in.\n\n550\n00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.699\nAnd I wanna stop there, cuz I don't wanna\nmigrate this into my own laptop and\n\n551\n00:27:11.699 --> 00:27:12.470\nlose my own stuff.\n\n552\n00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.440\nYou won't lose anything, it's just gonna\nundo some of the settings that I've got,\n\n553\n00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.190\nbut it does give me that chance\nto pick and choose my settings.\n\n554\n00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:21.430\nAnd just like when I did the Windows\nmachine, remember how I had the duplicate\n\n555\n00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.390\nuser account, Don Pezet on both of them,\nI've got that again.\n\n556\n00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:26.530\nI've got a Don Pezet\naccount on the Mac Mini and\n\n557\n00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.130\nI've got a Don Pezet account here,\nso it's asking me to rename it.\n\n558\n00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.218\nBut you'll see it's gonna\nget my applications.\n\n559\n00:27:31.218 --> 00:27:33.054\nThat's something we\ncouldn't do with Windows,\n\n560\n00:27:33.054 --> 00:27:35.090\nbecause Windows apps won't run on a Mac.\n\n561\n00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.860\nBut this is another Mac, so I can pull\nthe applications right off that Mac and\n\n562\n00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:38.950\nbring them over here.\n\n563\n00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:42.892\nWe can bring my user account and\neverything that's inside of it, desktop,\n\n564\n00:27:42.892 --> 00:27:47.389\ndocuments, downloads, movies, and all\nthat good stuff, other files and folders,\n\n565\n00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:50.180\nright, other files that it\nfinds on our hard drives.\n\n566\n00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:54.257\nAnd then computer and network settings,,\nit's gonna reach inside of that and get\n\n567\n00:27:54.257 --> 00:27:58.509\nthe settings that are based on, you know,\ncustomizations we've done to the finder,\n\n568\n00:27:58.509 --> 00:28:02.520\nor our energy savings settings,\nall of that stuff and bring those in too.\n\n569\n00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.710\nSo it's gonna grab all of that and\nbring it into that system.\n\n570\n00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:10.210\nThis is really incredibly useful when\nyou have a Mac that won't boot anymore.\n\n571\n00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.444\nSo the operating system's been\ncorrupted or something like that,\n\n572\n00:28:13.444 --> 00:28:15.613\nyou can boot into target mode and\nbring it in.\n\n573\n00:28:15.613 --> 00:28:18.482\nAnd now if you've got something that has\na real problem, like it's got a bad power\n\n574\n00:28:18.482 --> 00:28:21.077\nsupply, you can't boot into target\nmode if it's got a bad power supply.\n\n575\n00:28:21.077 --> 00:28:22.290\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n576\n00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.830\nSo then that's where you start thinking,\nokay, well, can I crack this case open?\n\n577\n00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.440\nCan I get that hard drive outta there?\n\n578\n00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.886\nBecause then I can hook it up externally\nto my system it will show up as a start up\n\n579\n00:28:30.886 --> 00:28:32.485\ndisc and we can bring it in that way.\n\n580\n00:28:32.485 --> 00:28:35.435\n>> Great information as we've been\ncontinuing along in the Apple\n\n581\n00:28:35.435 --> 00:28:37.450\ncertified support professional series.\n\n582\n00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:41.780\nNow, we've got more to go in this episode,\nbut it looks like we come to well,\n\n583\n00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.980\nthe end of our time here Don.\n\n584\n00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.412\nYou got anything else here for us?\n\n585\n00:28:44.412 --> 00:28:48.270\n>> All right, so what I've been doing in\nthis episode is kind of cheating, right?\n\n586\n00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.550\nWe wanna get the initial\nsetup of El Capitan done, so\n\n587\n00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:53.910\nlet's just take our settings from\nsomewhere else and bring them over.\n\n588\n00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:55.020\nBut what if we don't do that?\n\n589\n00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.680\nWhat if we want to start from scratch and\nreally get it set up?\n\n590\n00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.390\nWell that's what we're gonna\nsee in the next episode.\n\n591\n00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:01.200\nI know we don't have time here so\n\n592\n00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.280\nwe'll do a part two on this one and\nwe'll start going through all the little\n\n593\n00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.470\nsettings that we might wanna customize\nwhen you first get a new Mac.\n\n594\n00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.042\nIf we don't bring our settings\nin from another system.\n\n595\n00:29:10.042 --> 00:29:12.520\n>> All right, well thank you Don, and\nthank you everybody out there for\n\n596\n00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.170\nwatching us.\n\n597\n00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.421\nWere going to go ahead and\nsign out here at ITPro TV.\n\n598\n00:29:15.421 --> 00:29:16.639\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n599\n00:29:16.639 --> 00:29:17.579\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n600\n00:29:17.579 --> 00:29:19.623\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n601\n00:29:19.623 --> 00:29:27.270\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.700\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're gonna be moving through our\n\n4\n00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.460\nApple certified support professional and\nthis is a continuation so\n\n5\n00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.160\nwe're back at you with a part 2.\n\n6\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.040\nIn the first episode we took\na look at the migration assistant.\n\n7\n00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.910\nSo if you're migrating from Mac,\nif you're migrating from Windows to Mac\n\n8\n00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.440\nthat's where the episode portion of\nthe episode you need to look at.\n\n9\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.155\nSo in part 2 here we're coming\nback at ya with Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:38.385\nHow are you doing today Don?\n\n11\n00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:39.445\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:42.545\nYeah, just picking up like you said in\nthat last episode, the Migration Assistant\n\n13\n00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:46.913\nwas a great way to kinda cheat [LAUGH] and\nget a computer set up really fast.\n\n14\n00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:49.605\nIf I wanna get my new Mac set up\nexactly the way I want it, and\n\n15\n00:00:49.605 --> 00:00:52.555\nI wanna do it fast,\nMigration Assistant's great.\n\n16\n00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:54.720\nBut, what if you're not migrating?\n\n17\n00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.600\nWhat if this is just\nyour first computer and\n\n18\n00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.770\nyou need to get things\nset up from scratch?\n\n19\n00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.660\nWell that's what we're gonna\ntake a look at in this episode.\n\n20\n00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.780\nI'm gonna try and get through it here, but\n\n21\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.410\nwe might have to do\na part three on this one.\n\n22\n00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.980\nSo we're just gonna run through some of\nthe initial things that we've gotta do on\n\n23\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.000\na Mac to get it set up and\nconfigured the way that we want it, and\n\n24\n00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.160\njust get it working the right way for us.\n\n25\n00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.440\nNow, whenever I fire up a new system,\n\n26\n00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.510\none of the first things I wanna do,\nis get it up to date, right?\n\n27\n00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.690\nWhen you order a Mac, Apple's really\ngood about shipping stuff to you pretty\n\n28\n00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.530\nquickly, but\nthey release updates all the time.\n\n29\n00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.310\nAnd so it might be that you\nreceive your Mac one day,\n\n30\n00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.670\nand an update came out just\nthe day before, right?\n\n31\n00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.443\nI know it was just yesterday that, so\nwe're doing El Capitan now, right?\n\n32\n00:01:35.443 --> 00:01:40.075\n10.11, and\nI've got 10.11.3 loaded on this machine.\n\n33\n00:01:40.075 --> 00:01:42.780\n10.11.4 just went into the wild yesterday.\n\n34\n00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.190\nSo updates come out.\n\n35\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.890\nAnd sometimes they fix problems,\nsometimes they introduce new features,\n\n36\n00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.060\nsome really cool stuff.\n\n37\n00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.720\nAnd so you wanna get that feature\nfunctionality right away.\n\n38\n00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.160\nSo when I get a new machine,\ndoing my updates,\n\n39\n00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.710\nthat's one of the first\nthings that I tackle.\n\n40\n00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.440\nSo if I want to do updates,\nthere's something I need.\n\n41\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.990\nI need to be able to talk to Apple.\n\n42\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.110\nI need to have network connectivity and\n\n43\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.260\nsometimes network connectivity\nis just automatic.\n\n44\n00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.365\nYou turn on your Mac and\nit automatically jumps onto the network.\n\n45\n00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:12.650\nBut most of the time, you're gonna have\nto go in there and set some things up.\n\n46\n00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.310\nAnd so that's what we're gonna take a look\nat here at the beginning of this episode,\n\n47\n00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.660\nis getting the network\nconfigured in our new system.\n\n48\n00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.270\nUnfortunately, it doesn't matter if you\nhave a Mac Mini, a MacPro, a Macbook,\n\n49\n00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.750\na Macbook Air, or whatever it is, they\nall base we could figure the same way.\n\n50\n00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.890\nIt’s always tend,\nyou jump in new settings need,\n\n51\n00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.020\nwe’ve got your options right in there.\n\n52\n00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.340\nSo let start with that.\n\n53\n00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.240\nNow, when you look out the Mac,\n\n54\n00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.760\nthere’s two types of network\nconnectivity we’ve got.\n\n55\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.200\nThis is actually three but\ntwo that we care about here.\n\n56\n00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.160\nThere’s wired and wireless.\n\n57\n00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.990\nSo wireless, you're gonna have a radio\nantennae built into your Mac that will\n\n58\n00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.640\nbe able to look out\nthere on the network and\n\n59\n00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.070\nfind wireless systems and connect up and\ngo without plugging in a cable.\n\n60\n00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.540\nWired, you're gonna have a physical jack.\n\n61\n00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.310\nIf you have an iMac, then on your iMac,\nyou'll have a physical jack, and you might\n\n62\n00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.400\nsee a little icon up here that shows your\nMac plugged in to a physical network.\n\n63\n00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.740\nIf you're on a Macbook like mine,\nI don't have a physical jack.\n\n64\n00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.850\nAnd so instead,\nI need to connect to a wireless network.\n\n65\n00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.860\nWell, I said I don't have a physical jack,\nI actually do.\n\n66\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.070\nI'm gonna show this here.\n\n67\n00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.030\nSo what we use here in the studio,\nwireless networks are great but sometimes\n\n68\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.420\nwe get interference, so we use these\nlittle thunder bolt to RJ 45 adapters.\n\n69\n00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.280\nApple, they use to include\nthese with the iMacs but\n\n70\n00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.040\nbe always end up having\nto by them separate.\n\n71\n00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.050\nBut you can pop these on to get a physical\nnetwork connection on your device even\n\n72\n00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.450\nthough it might not have that jack.\n\n73\n00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.050\nNow, if you have an iMac or\na Mac Pro, even the Mac minis,\n\n74\n00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.450\nthey've got the physical jack on them.\n\n75\n00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.030\nBut if you have a Mac Book,\nMac Book Air or\n\n76\n00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.590\nany of the laptop devices, they're not\ngonna have it, so these come in handy.\n\n77\n00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.330\nSo you can add a physical jack\nto your system if you want.\n\n78\n00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.310\nAnd that does make life\na little bit easier for\n\n79\n00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.730\nus if we're trying to get connected and\nhave a reliable connection.\n\n80\n00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.930\nWired is really the way to go.\n\n81\n00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.640\nAll right, so if you look at my laptop,\nand this isn't like a lab machine,\n\n82\n00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.180\nthis is my actual laptop.\n\n83\n00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.190\nWhen I look at it, I just unplugged\nthat physical network jack, so\n\n84\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.470\nI'm not plugged in.\n\n85\n00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.430\nAnd up here in my menu bar,\nyou can see up by my clock, I've got this\n\n86\n00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.130\nlittle symbol right here, and that lets\nme know that I'm on a wireless network.\n\n87\n00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.710\nSo I'm using the wireless network here\nin the studio and that's great, right?\n\n88\n00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.670\nBut wireless networks,\nthey only go so fast, right?\n\n89\n00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.964\nSo our network here,\nI don't remember Wes, is ours 802.11?\n\n90\n00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:24.800\nIt's not 802.11AC is it?\n\n91\n00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.750\n>> It's not AC, it's N, yeah.\n\n92\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.490\n>> N, okay.\nSo we've got 802.11N, and that means that\n\n93\n00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.330\nwe're pushing anywhere from,\nI guess it could be as low as 11 megabit,\n\n94\n00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.700\nbut all the way up to about 200 megabit,\non the 802.11N network.\n\n95\n00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.230\nNormally you're gonna get somewhere\nmore like 54 megabit in bandwidth on it.\n\n96\n00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.350\nIf I switch to a wired connection though,\nI might be able to get 100 megabit or\n\n97\n00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.280\na gigabit, or even 10 gigabit,\n\n98\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.500\nthey've got some really fast\nnetworks that are out there.\n\n99\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.620\nAnd a wired connection is always\navailable, a wireless network,\n\n100\n00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.990\nthere's things that can interfere.\n\n101\n00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.400\nI might have a wall in between me and\nthere,\n\n102\n00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.090\nI might have all sorts of different\nthings that interfere with that signal.\n\n103\n00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.830\nAnd the signal starts to degrade.\n\n104\n00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.090\nSo when you look at all this wireless\nnetworks that are our there,\n\n105\n00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.520\nthis little symbol, well,\nthose bars all represent signal strength,\n\n106\n00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.460\nand there's five or four bars,\nfour bars, here we go.\n\n107\n00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.070\nAnd right now all these wireless networks\nfrom here showing up as four bars each.\n\n108\n00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.560\nThat means these are really strong.\n\n109\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.790\nThe reason they are strong is the access\npoint is just on the other side of that\n\n110\n00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.370\nwall there.\n\n111\n00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.680\nSo, I'm really close.\n\n112\n00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.220\nBut the further away from the access\npoint I get, the weaker that signal gets.\n\n113\n00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.810\nAnd the weaker that signal gets,\nthe less bandwidth I can push.\n\n114\n00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.950\nSo, I might have 54 megabit when I'm\nright next to that 802.11g wireless.\n\n115\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.980\nAnd then as I move 100 feet away, I drop\ndown to 11 megabit or something like that.\n\n116\n00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.500\nWireless is not consistent.\n\n117\n00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.320\nLet me just show you.\n\n118\n00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.270\nI know my system was showing four bars.\n\n119\n00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.500\nBut I've got a Wi-Fi analyzer here.\n\n120\n00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.760\nAnd what you'll see is that the ITProTV\nwireless here in the studio,\n\n121\n00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.840\nthere's actually four\ndifferent wireless networks.\n\n122\n00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.210\nSome of them are 2.4 gigahertz.\n\n123\n00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.840\nSome of them are 5 gigahertz.\n\n124\n00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.262\n5 gigahertz is faster, but\nit doesn't penetrate walls as well.\n\n125\n00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:06.680\n2.4 gigahertz is slower, but\nit does penetrate walls better.\n\n126\n00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.400\nAnd so our access points have both of them\nbuilt in, and they're Apple access points,\n\n127\n00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.830\nthey're little AirPorts.\n\n128\n00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.580\nAnd we've got two of them,\n\n129\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.600\nso I see the two antennas on the first one\nand the two antennas on the second one.\n\n130\n00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.790\nNow I had four bars on my laptop and\nif I look over here,\n\n131\n00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.360\nyou'll see where on this access\npoint I've got a good strong signal.\n\n132\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.350\nBut on the other access points\nit gets weaker and weaker and\n\n133\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.380\nthis one is nonexistent.\n\n134\n00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.370\nIn fact, I'm not even seeing that anymore.\n\n135\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.870\nI'm too far away from it.\n\n136\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.070\nBut it's remembering here in this\nprogram that if I move closer,\n\n137\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.310\nthe signal will light up.\n\n138\n00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.230\nSo, these change based\non just little things.\n\n139\n00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.420\nEven if I were to lift my laptop up and\nstart moving it around,\n\n140\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.670\nlike this, we'll start to see\nthe signals adjust because,\n\n141\n00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.270\nthe antennas are built\ninto the lid of my laptop.\n\n142\n00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.420\nSo, it's going to adjust that setting and\nput it in different places.\n\n143\n00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.550\nSo understand that wireless\nnetworks are not as reliable.\n\n144\n00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.880\nSo when you get that nice new Mac and\nyou're ready to set it up,\n\n145\n00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.960\nyou may want to set up a wired connection,\nversus a wireless.\n\n146\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.930\nIt's entirely up to you which\none you want to set up.\n\n147\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.500\nOn a wired network, I'll take this machine\nhere, this is a new El Capitan install,\n\n148\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.620\nand I'm gonna go up here\non my system preferences.\n\n149\n00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.370\nAnd inside of system preferences,\nyou've got the network system preference.\n\n150\n00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.440\nAnd when you go on the network this is\nwhere we could go for wired and wireless.\n\n151\n00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.880\nWhat you're gonna see on the left is\na list of all your network connections.\n\n152\n00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.290\nAnd see this one has an ethernet\nconnection and that's it.\n\n153\n00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.580\nThat's the only thing that I've got,\n\n154\n00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.240\nI just have a wired connection,\nwas kind of I'm in a virtual machine.\n\n155\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.720\nEvery Mac these days has\na wireless adapter built into it.\n\n156\n00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.450\nSo you normally see a minimum of\none ethernet and one wireless.\n\n157\n00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.670\nWell, I guess you don't\nalways see an ethernet.\n\n158\n00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.740\nTake my actual laptop.\n\n159\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.330\nSo let me go back to\nmy actual laptop here.\n\n160\n00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.450\nIf I go into my system preferences.\n\n161\n00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.196\nAnd, I go into network,\nI've got all sorts of networks on mine.\n\n162\n00:07:55.196 --> 00:07:59.146\nYou'll notice this list is full of all\nsorts of other stuff that wasn't In\n\n163\n00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:00.430\nthat virtual machine.\n\n164\n00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.571\nWell the virtual machine is nice and\nclean.\n\n165\n00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:03.430\nIt's a brand new install of El Capitan.\n\n166\n00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.290\nMy laptop on the other hand,\nI've installed all sorts of junk on here.\n\n167\n00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.250\nSo I do see my Wi-Fi connection,\nright here.\n\n168\n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.798\nSo I have Wi-Fi, and as I scroll down,\n\n169\n00:08:11.798 --> 00:08:15.747\nI'll see other things like\na Thunderbolt Ethernet bridge.\n\n170\n00:08:15.747 --> 00:08:18.330\nAnd see how it's not connected and\nit's red?\n\n171\n00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.280\nWhat it's talking about is this little\nremovable dongle that I yanked off\n\n172\n00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.450\nmy laptop a few moments\nago while we were talking.\n\n173\n00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.640\nSo if I were to plug that back in,\n\n174\n00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.400\nwe'll see this change to reflect\nthat new adaptor show up.\n\n175\n00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.820\nSo on my iMac at home it has\na Ethernet connection and\n\n176\n00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.080\na Wi-Fi connection and they both show up\n[COUGH] cuz they're built into the device.\n\n177\n00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.800\nAnd so we'll see that change in a moment\nhere, if we just give it a moment,\n\n178\n00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.886\nit'll pick that up.\n\n179\n00:08:42.886 --> 00:08:44.870\n>> Don, does it have a precedence?\n\n180\n00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.870\nBecause I just noticed you had Wi-Fi,\nthat's what you were connected to.\n\n181\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:52.740\nThe moment you plugged that adaptor in\nthere, it seems like it jumped from\n\n182\n00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.460\nthe wireless to the wired, so\nis there a preference there?\n\n183\n00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.170\n>> Absolutely,\nthe order of these matter, right?\n\n184\n00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:03.480\nBecause think about it like on my\nlaptop right now I now have Wi-Fi and\n\n185\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.030\na Thunderbolt Ethernet adaptor,\nI have both.\n\n186\n00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.000\nWhich one's gonna get\nme the better signal?\n\n187\n00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.150\nThe Thunderbolt adaptor.\n\n188\n00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.056\nThat one's gonna give me\nthe better signal, it's wired.\n\n189\n00:09:11.056 --> 00:09:14.331\nI've got a 100 megabit,\na gigabit or whatever,\n\n190\n00:09:14.331 --> 00:09:17.168\nand it's always on, it's always running.\n\n191\n00:09:17.168 --> 00:09:20.460\nI don't have to worry about how many walls\nare between me and the network jack.\n\n192\n00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.860\nIt's just gonna be at a consistent\nbandwidth, it's a better connection.\n\n193\n00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.240\nAnd so see how my Mac put it on top?\n\n194\n00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.687\nIt was way down at the bottom\nwhen it was disconnected.\n\n195\n00:09:27.687 --> 00:09:30.403\nNow, it's up at the top because\nit's the best connection available.\n\n196\n00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:31.890\nWi-Fi's in second place.\n\n197\n00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.576\nSo even though I'm connected\nto the Wi-Fi network,\n\n198\n00:09:34.576 --> 00:09:37.630\nI'm not actually using it anymore,\nit's a backup.\n\n199\n00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.496\nIf my other connection dies,\nI'll flip back over to wireless.\n\n200\n00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.505\nBut right now,\nit's just kind of sitting there.\n\n201\n00:09:41.505 --> 00:09:44.061\nAnd with some of those other\nconnections Don, I was wondering,\n\n202\n00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:46.853\nthese might just be maybe stuff that\nyou've connected to in the past,\n\n203\n00:09:46.853 --> 00:09:49.009\nmaybe just remembering it,\nis that what we see here?\n\n204\n00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:50.262\n>> Yes, that's exactly it.\n\n205\n00:09:50.262 --> 00:09:51.771\nAll these are remembered connections.\n\n206\n00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:55.920\nSo you'll see I've got a USB Ethernet,\nthat's my docking station in my office.\n\n207\n00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.888\nWhen I go into my office and\nI drop my laptop on the docking station,\n\n208\n00:09:58.888 --> 00:10:00.851\nI have a USB network\nadaptor attached to it.\n\n209\n00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:03.000\nThe device picks up and it uses that one.\n\n210\n00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.527\nIt's not connected right now, so it's way\ndown here and it's red and you'll see some\n\n211\n00:10:06.527 --> 00:10:09.535\nother ones like that, I apparently\nhave another USB adaptor somewhere.\n\n212\n00:10:09.535 --> 00:10:11.996\nMy Bluetooth,\nif you've got a Bluetooth antenna.\n\n213\n00:10:11.996 --> 00:10:15.557\nBluetooth connections actually make\na network and so that's what we see,\n\n214\n00:10:15.557 --> 00:10:18.102\nthat's that third connection\nI mentioned earlier,\n\n215\n00:10:18.102 --> 00:10:21.050\nI said there's two we cared about,\nwired and wireless.\n\n216\n00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.137\nBut Bluetooth is that third one,\nand it's wireless also.\n\n217\n00:10:23.137 --> 00:10:26.672\nAnd so I should really say,\nEthernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth,\n\n218\n00:10:26.672 --> 00:10:29.770\nthose are the three connections and\nso we'll see those.\n\n219\n00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.870\nThere's other ones that might\nturn up if you've got FireWire.\n\n220\n00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.460\nFireWire will show up in here too\ncuz FireWire builds a network.\n\n221\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.430\nA lot of people don't realize that.\n\n222\n00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.530\nAnd these other ones are devices\nwe have here at the studio,\n\n223\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.070\nthese AJA Mini Converters or\nthe Airconsole Serial Port.\n\n224\n00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.190\nThat's actually a little device I\nuse to manage Cisco routers and\n\n225\n00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.950\nswitches over a wireless network.\n\n226\n00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.940\nAnd so those are adding themselves\nin like virtual network adapters.\n\n227\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.830\nAnd you know Wes,\n\n228\n00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.340\nI completely wandered from your\nquestion about is there an order?\n\n229\n00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.430\nYes, there's an order.\n\n230\n00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.573\nWe see that, we see it is\nprioritizing these adapters but\n\n231\n00:10:59.573 --> 00:11:01.480\nyou can influence that order too.\n\n232\n00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.633\nWhen you take a look at some of these,\n\n233\n00:11:03.633 --> 00:11:08.009\nif I decide that one of these USB adapters\nis more important than the other,\n\n234\n00:11:08.009 --> 00:11:11.420\nyou can take them and\nrearrange them in the system.\n\n235\n00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.903\nIf you click on the little\ngear icon here at the bottom,\n\n236\n00:11:14.903 --> 00:11:16.960\nyou've got set Service Order.\n\n237\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.927\nAnd when you choose set Service Order,\nit takes you to this screen, and\n\n238\n00:11:20.927 --> 00:11:24.565\nhere we can drag and drop these things and\nmove them around to say,\n\n239\n00:11:24.565 --> 00:11:28.357\nthese connections are more important\nthat the other connections.\n\n240\n00:11:28.357 --> 00:11:33.121\nYou kind of set that organization as\nyou want it, and get things arranged.\n\n241\n00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:34.475\nSo my Thunderbolt Ethernet,\n\n242\n00:11:34.475 --> 00:11:37.596\nthat's my most important adaptor\nthat I move all the way to the top.\n\n243\n00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:42.162\nAfter that, my USB connectors\nare the next best thing that I've got.\n\n244\n00:11:42.162 --> 00:11:45.019\nAnd then we'll go Wi-Fi, and\nthen all my miscellaneous hardware,\n\n245\n00:11:45.019 --> 00:11:47.150\nwe'll stick that down here at the bottom.\n\n246\n00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:51.040\nSo I can rearrange it even though those\ndevices aren't connected right now.\n\n247\n00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.930\nSo that's changing that order and\ngetting them optimized and in place.\n\n248\n00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.520\nNow, in my Thunderbolt adaptor,\n\n249\n00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.840\nlet's take a look at the settings\nthat are on this one.\n\n250\n00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.450\nFor most of us,\nwe're gonna stick with the default,\n\n251\n00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:06.160\nwhich is an Automatic location using DHCP.\n\n252\n00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.260\nDHCP is\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n253\n00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.191\nIt means when I plugin to the network,\nour laptop, our desktop,\n\n254\n00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:15.622\nwhatever is gonna talk to network,\nis gonna say hey, can somebody help me?\n\n255\n00:12:15.622 --> 00:12:19.981\nI need an IP address, I need a subnet\nmask, I need DNS servers, I need a router,\n\n256\n00:12:19.981 --> 00:12:23.189\nI need all these information,\ncan somebody give it to me?\n\n257\n00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.960\nAnd hopefully, someone on\nthe network will give it to you.\n\n258\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.304\nThe other option is instead of using DHCP,\nwe can say manually.\n\n259\n00:12:31.304 --> 00:12:35.966\nAnd if we say manually, now we say, we're\ngonna tell it what the IP address is,\n\n260\n00:12:35.966 --> 00:12:41.000\nwhat the subnet mask is, what the gateway\nis, what all these various settings are.\n\n261\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.171\nSo most of the time, 99% of the time,\npeople are gonna use DHCP.\n\n262\n00:12:46.171 --> 00:12:48.220\nIt's very, very common so\nwe're don't have to worry about it.\n\n263\n00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.930\nYou just plug it in and you're done.\n\n264\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.990\nBut on the exam,\nthey want you to know both ways, so\n\n265\n00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.700\nlet's talk a little bit about\neach of these settings.\n\n266\n00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.790\nThe first setting is the IP Address.\n\n267\n00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:01.750\nThe IP Address is how your computer\nis identified on the network.\n\n268\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.970\nAnd I always talk about it as like\na street address for a building.\n\n269\n00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:11.110\nSo the building we're in right now\nis 6933 Northwest 4th Boulevard.\n\n270\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.650\nAnd if you look at that 6933,\n\n271\n00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.068\nthat's our building number, that's what\nidentifies this particular building.\n\n272\n00:13:17.068 --> 00:13:21.274\nAnd then Northwest 4th Boulevard, that's\nthe street that's outside of our building.\n\n273\n00:13:21.274 --> 00:13:23.975\nAnd so if I tell you that information,\nyou can find the street and\n\n274\n00:13:23.975 --> 00:13:25.136\nyou can find our building.\n\n275\n00:13:25.136 --> 00:13:26.990\nThat's how you find your way here.\n\n276\n00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.590\nComputers are the same way,\nthey need an IP address so\n\n277\n00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.540\npeople know how to find the machine.\n\n278\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.529\nAnd they do that with an address\nthat'll look something like this,\n\n279\n00:13:38.529 --> 00:13:45.108\nlike if I give this one let's say,\nwell thus is my laptop so 10.1.230.241.\n\n280\n00:13:45.108 --> 00:13:49.474\nSo 10.1.230.241 where\ndo I get that number?\n\n281\n00:13:49.474 --> 00:13:50.658\nDid I just make it up?\n\n282\n00:13:50.658 --> 00:13:52.310\nWell part of it I made up, yeah.\n\n283\n00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.556\nBut part of it is very important.\n\n284\n00:13:54.556 --> 00:14:01.020\nOne part of this address is my network ID,\nand the network ID has to be right.\n\n285\n00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.040\nAnd then the last part is the host ID,\nand the host ID is just my laptop.\n\n286\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.150\nAnd that's where we have a little\nbit of flexibility on what that\n\n287\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.700\naddress is going to be.\n\n288\n00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.800\nSee this guy right here, this Subnet Mask?\n\n289\n00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:15.050\nThe Subnet Mask is what tells me\nwhat part of this is my network ID,\n\n290\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.760\nand what part is my host ID.\n\n291\n00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.286\nSo see how it's got 255.255.255.0?\n\n292\n00:14:21.286 --> 00:14:27.220\nWell when we got a 255, that's telling\nme that's part of a network ID.\n\n293\n00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.680\nAnd where we've got a 0,\nthat's part of a host ID.\n\n294\n00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.095\nSo this is a Subnet Mask that I\ngot it could also be something\n\n295\n00:14:34.095 --> 00:14:36.337\nlike this 255.255.0.0.\n\n296\n00:14:36.337 --> 00:14:39.774\nSo now the first two numbers\nare part of the network ID or\n\n297\n00:14:39.774 --> 00:14:45.308\nmaybe even 255.0.0.0, were only the first\nnumber as part of the network ID and\n\n298\n00:14:45.308 --> 00:14:49.030\nthe other three numbers\nare part of the host ID.\n\n299\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.060\nThe important thing to remember\nhere is that in order for\n\n300\n00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:57.450\ntwo computers to talk on the network,\nthey've gotta have the same network ID.\n\n301\n00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.750\nSo if this is my Subnet Mask and\nthese first three numbers are 255s,\n\n302\n00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:07.890\nthat tells me that the first three\nnumbers here are part of my network ID.\n\n303\n00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.320\nAnd that's like the street in an address.\n\n304\n00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.003\nSo I said, I was on Northwest 4th\nBoulevard, that's what 10.1.230 is.\n\n305\n00:15:14.003 --> 00:15:18.588\nThat's my Northwest 4th Boulevard and\n241, that's like my building number.\n\n306\n00:15:18.588 --> 00:15:22.690\nSo my building number is 241,\nI'm the only 241 on this number.\n\n307\n00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.120\nBut there might be other people,\nlike Wes' laptop.\n\n308\n00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:30.160\nIf Wes' laptop starts with 10.1.230,\nI'll be able to talk to him.\n\n309\n00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.070\nIf his laptop doesn't start with 10.1.230,\nthen I won't be able to talk with him.\n\n310\n00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.140\nHe's on a different network.\n\n311\n00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.390\nWe've gotta be on\nthe same network to talk.\n\n312\n00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.020\nWell, there's an exception to that.\n\n313\n00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:46.250\nI can't talk to him directly, but\nsomebody can help me get to him.\n\n314\n00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:50.204\nIf I had a router, a router could\nhelp me get to other networks, and\n\n315\n00:15:50.204 --> 00:15:52.124\neverybody uses routers today.\n\n316\n00:15:52.124 --> 00:15:54.920\nIf you're connected to the Internet,\nyou're using a router.\n\n317\n00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.114\nBecause when you get on the Internet there\nare thousands upon thousands of networks\n\n318\n00:15:58.114 --> 00:15:59.174\nout there in the Internet.\n\n319\n00:15:59.174 --> 00:16:02.063\nAnd you don't know how to get there,\nyou don't know how to get to them.\n\n320\n00:16:02.063 --> 00:16:04.344\nSo you need a router to find the way.\n\n321\n00:16:04.344 --> 00:16:08.485\nAnd the router is what this next\nlittle entry is right here.\n\n322\n00:16:08.485 --> 00:16:09.400\n10.1.230.1.\nThat's the router.\n\n323\n00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.530\nIt's actually a firewall\nhere in our building.\n\n324\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:17.040\nAnd if I want to talk to another network,\nif I want to go to Apple's website or\n\n325\n00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.000\nGoogle's website or whatever,\nit's a different network.\n\n326\n00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.630\nI don't know how to get there.\n\n327\n00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.190\nBut the router will help me.\n\n328\n00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.640\nAnd so these three pieces of\ninformation are critical.\n\n329\n00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.520\nYou've gotta have an IP address.\n\n330\n00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.380\nYou've gotta have a subnet mask,\nso you know what's the network and\n\n331\n00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:30.980\nwhat's the host ID.\n\n332\n00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.770\nAnd you've gotta have a router if you\nintend to talk to other networks.\n\n333\n00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.600\n>> Now, Don, I'm gonna play\ndevil's advocate here, right?\n\n334\n00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.780\nWe're 6933 Northwest Fourth Boulevard.\n\n335\n00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.960\nI decide I don't care what the city\nsays or how they name it or anything.\n\n336\n00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.115\nI'm gonna but a mailbox right in between\nthere that's gonna have the same exact\n\n337\n00:16:46.115 --> 00:16:48.972\naddress In our networking\nwhat would that do?\n\n338\n00:16:48.972 --> 00:16:50.860\n>> All right so\nduplicate IP addresses are a bad thing.\n\n339\n00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.270\nIf you have two machines with\nthe same address, they conflict.\n\n340\n00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.340\nAnd what'll normally happen is the second\nsystem to come up will just not be able to\n\n341\n00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.710\ncommunicate on the network.\n\n342\n00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:03.310\nBut there are times where they're both\nable to communicate, and if that happens,\n\n343\n00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.780\nany traffic that's being sent to you is\nalso being sent to that other system.\n\n344\n00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.450\nAnd now you can end up with\ntraffic that is either broken or\n\n345\n00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.430\nyour data is being leaked to someone else.\n\n346\n00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:13.210\nNot a good thing,\n\n347\n00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.280\nyou definitely don't want to have\nduplicate IP addresses on your network.\n\n348\n00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.170\nAll right, now,\nthese are the critical things.\n\n349\n00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.840\nWe definitely need to have\nthose three settings and\n\n350\n00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.470\nthey're right here on the main page.\n\n351\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.130\nBut there's a little bit more,\nlike the DNS server and\n\n352\n00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.430\nthose are pretty important too, okay?\n\n353\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:31.840\nFor a DNS server, if I go into advanced,\nwe've got a whole DNS tab right here,\n\n354\n00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.400\nand we can specify DNS servers.\n\n355\n00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.320\nNow DNS stands for\nthe Domain Naming System, and\n\n356\n00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:42.840\nDNS is how we convert IP addresses\ninto names and vice versa.\n\n357\n00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.580\nIf I ask you to go to our website,\nyou're gonna fire up a web browser and\n\n358\n00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.470\nyou're gonna type in, itpro.tv.\n\n359\n00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.070\nRight?\n\n360\n00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:53.090\nYou're not gonna fire up a web browser and\ntype in 209.251.159.179, or\n\n361\n00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:58.960\nwhatever IP address is in fact,\nI don't even know, let's find out.\n\n362\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:06.503\nSo, if I jump in here and just do a quick\nnslookup for itpro.tv, there we go.\n\n363\n00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:09.866\nAll right, so\nif you want to browse to our website,\n\n364\n00:18:09.866 --> 00:18:14.652\nyou don't fire up a web browser and\ntype 192.124.249.6.\n\n365\n00:18:14.652 --> 00:18:15.755\nIt doesn't roll off the tongue.\n\n366\n00:18:15.755 --> 00:18:21.069\nYou're like, yeah, I love this video\nthat I watched over on 192.124.249.6.\n\n367\n00:18:21.069 --> 00:18:22.427\nYou should check it out.\n\n368\n00:18:22.427 --> 00:18:23.809\nThat's not what we do, right?\n\n369\n00:18:23.809 --> 00:18:30.120\nWe wanna have nice easy names to remember\nand not crazy numbers like these, right?\n\n370\n00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.570\nSo DNS lets us do that.\n\n371\n00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.150\nMaps a name to a number.\n\n372\n00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.460\nSo in your web browser,\nyou might fire up Safari.\n\n373\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:42.980\nAnd in Safari you might type in\nitpro.tv to browse the website.\n\n374\n00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.460\nBut in the background the computer\nis saying, okay, itpro.tv.\n\n375\n00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.860\nWhat's the IP address?\n\n376\n00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.400\nLet me go to a DNS server and\nI'll get them to convert it.\n\n377\n00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.160\nFrom a name to an IP,\nand then we can talk.\n\n378\n00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.520\nAnd that's what's happening.\n\n379\n00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.430\nIn the background it's looking\nto its name servers, and\n\n380\n00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:00.400\nthat's exactly what I did here.\n\n381\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.640\nThis utility that I used, nslookup,\nthat's name server look up.\n\n382\n00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:11.790\nI did a name server look up against\nitpro.tv and it returned this IP address.\n\n383\n00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:16.440\nAnd I'm talking to that address if I,\nwe'll use another utility.\n\n384\n00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.210\nWe're going to talk about some\nof these network utilities and\n\n385\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.030\nthe trouble shooting episode,\nbut this is the net stat utility.\n\n386\n00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:25.030\nIt lets you see what is running\nin the background on your system.\n\n387\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.750\nWhat network communications you're doing.\n\n388\n00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.190\nSo I'm just going to look for\n\n389\n00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:33.672\nany network communications that\nI've got to 192.124.249.6.\n\n390\n00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:37.430\nOkay, and when I did that\nlook up I got nothing back.\n\n391\n00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.550\nShoot.\nYesterday I was doing a lot of work on\n\n392\n00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.480\nan alternate server, so\nI was overriding that file.\n\n393\n00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.800\nLet me just quite my name mapping\nprogram here and that will go back.\n\n394\n00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.550\nThere we go.\n\n395\n00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:48.710\nAll right, so I'm just going to go\nbrowse back to that page again, right?\n\n396\n00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.040\nSo if I fire up safari and\n\n397\n00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.672\nI go to itpro.tv it's gonna\nto reach out to our server.\n\n398\n00:19:54.672 --> 00:19:56.000\nI'm gonna view that page, and\n\n399\n00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.680\nin the background I'm just gonna do\na quick little, that's that, there we go.\n\n400\n00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.804\nThat's what I expected to see.\n\n401\n00:20:00.804 --> 00:20:05.257\nI can see that I've got all these\nconnections to the server and\n\n402\n00:20:05.257 --> 00:20:12.721\nthey're connected not to itvpro.tv, but\nI'm connected to 192.124.249.6, right?\n\n403\n00:20:12.721 --> 00:20:16.080\nWe're establishing all those connections\nout there to get to our website.\n\n404\n00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.390\nThe computer uses the numbers.\n\n405\n00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:21.820\nWe use names and\nDNS servers are what's providing that.\n\n406\n00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:26.220\nSo if you don't have a DNS server you\nbetter be good at remembering numbers.\n\n407\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.430\nAnd so you'll see where I've got mine set\nhere and I'm using a DNS server 8.8.8.8 so\n\n408\n00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.880\nanytime I throw a name at it It's\ngonna run it against that server and\n\n409\n00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.900\nget an IP address.\n\n410\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.410\n>> Don, can you tell us a little bit\nabout why you have a plus button?\n\n411\n00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.980\nI noticed the plus button in the DNS\nsettings and it says IPB 4 or IPB 6 so\n\n412\n00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.300\nI can only imagine that you're gonna\nput another IPB 4 address in there.\n\n413\n00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.580\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\nyou might want more than one DNS server,\n\n414\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.770\nbecause what happens if this DNS server\ngoes down and I can't get to it?\n\n415\n00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.800\nWell, I can't do hookups.\n\n416\n00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.680\nThen now I have a hard time browsing\nthe internet cuz I can't type names.\n\n417\n00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.520\nSo you might wanna add more than one.\n\n418\n00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.440\nSo these are Google's DNS servers,\nso I might put those in, or\n\n419\n00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.090\nwe could do Level 3s, or\nwhoever your internet service provider is,\n\n420\n00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.160\nthey're going to have DNS\nservers that you can use.\n\n421\n00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.180\nAnd you can punch in as many as you want.\n\n422\n00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.510\nNot really a whole lot of reason\nto punch in more than two though.\n\n423\n00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.710\nYou're only going to use the first one.\n\n424\n00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.090\nUnless the first one fails,\nthen you will use the second one.\n\n425\n00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:20.490\nSo, if you're putting in more than two,\nyou're saying what if two of them fail?\n\n426\n00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:23.120\nAnd if two of them fail you've got\nsome other problems on the network.\n\n427\n00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.770\nSo, I don't normally bother\ngoing beyond two, but\n\n428\n00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.600\nyou can put in as many as you want.\n\n429\n00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.780\nI don't know that there even is a limit.\n\n430\n00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.480\nAnd then you've also got these\nsearch domains over here.\n\n431\n00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.620\nWell, when we put in a name,\nwe normally do a full name so\n\n432\n00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.710\nI see something like www.google.com,\nall right?\n\n433\n00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:45.270\nWell, when I go to do a name lookup,\nI have to type in www.google.com.\n\n434\n00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.990\nIf I just type www and\nhit enter, what happens?\n\n435\n00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.970\nWell, it tries to find a server\nnamed www and there isn't one.\n\n436\n00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.290\nSo then it goes to these search domains\nand it'll say, all right, well,\n\n437\n00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:00.930\nlet me search for www.studio.itpro.tv and\nsee what I get, right?\n\n438\n00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.000\nSo let me show you this in action here.\n\n439\n00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.730\nIf I go back to my terminal and I'm just\ngonna do an nslookup for www, right?\n\n440\n00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.030\nAnd when I run that, can't find it right.\n\n441\n00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.242\nThere's an x domain,\ndomain doesn't exist, that's it.\n\n442\n00:22:13.242 --> 00:22:17.315\nBut if I go back to my search domains and\nI add in something like,\n\n443\n00:22:17.315 --> 00:22:19.960\ngoogle.com, right?\n\n444\n00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.010\nSo now it's gonna do a look up for\nwww, that's gonna fail.\n\n445\n00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:28.350\nAnd then it'll start tacking these search\ndomains on until it finds one that wins.\n\n446\n00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:32.384\nAnd you can have more then one, so\nI could punch in itpro.tv and so on.\n\n447\n00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:36.500\nAnd you can rearrange the order that\nthey're gonna be run to figure out which\n\n448\n00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.236\none is the most important to you, right?\n\n449\n00:22:38.236 --> 00:22:41.630\nSo, I'm gonna punch that in and\nI'll just hit OK on that and hit Apply so\n\n450\n00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:42.295\nit takes effect.\n\n451\n00:22:42.295 --> 00:22:46.720\nAnd then back here,\nI'm gonna rerun that lookup for www and\n\n452\n00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.830\nthis time I get all of\ngoogle's servers back, right?\n\n453\n00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.360\nThat's that search suffix,\nwhere it is looking for\n\n454\n00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.430\nthose additional search\ndomains to resolve that name.\n\n455\n00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.090\nThese are things that are not required,\nyou don't have to set search domains but\n\n456\n00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.300\nthey just make life a little bit easier.\n\n457\n00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.280\nYou can type a single name instead\nof a fully qualified name.\n\n458\n00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.835\n>> So Don if you had,\nlet's say you had taken the first example,\n\n459\n00:23:05.835 --> 00:23:12.450\nstudio.itpro.tv there, if we had a server\nin here, in our network called FTP.\n\n460\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.560\nThat was the name of the server.\n\n461\n00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.550\nIt's gonna try 8.8.8 and then 8.8.4.4 and\n\n462\n00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.920\nthen it's gonna fall back\nto the search domain.\n\n463\n00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.560\nIs that how it works?\n\n464\n00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.210\nOr would it go right to the domain itself?\n\n465\n00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:22.480\n>> It would stay right on 8.8.8.\n\n466\n00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.670\nIt's never gonna move away from that\nfirst one unless the first one fails.\n\n467\n00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:30.160\nSo as long as that one's up, it will\nnever, ever, ever hit that second one.\n\n468\n00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.370\nPeriod, right?\n\n469\n00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:32.220\nSo 8.8.8 is up.\n\n470\n00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.300\nIt's gonna talk to it and\nit's gonna ask it,\n\n471\n00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.630\nhey do you know who www is,\njust by itself?\n\n472\n00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.960\nAnd that server's gonna come back and\nsay no, I don't know who that is.\n\n473\n00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.740\nIt's just a single name, I can't do that.\n\n474\n00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.450\nAnd then we're gonna take\nthe first search domain and\n\n475\n00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:50.360\ntack it on the end of www and\nin my case it's www.google.com.\n\n476\n00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.150\nSo we'd throw that and yeah,\nGoogle's gonna know who that is.\n\n477\n00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.870\nBut let's say it didn't, then it\nwould go to the next search domain,\n\n478\n00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:56.840\nwhich was itpro.tv.\n\n479\n00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.170\nAnd it would say,\ndo you know who www.itpro.tv is?\n\n480\n00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.770\nAnd then it would respond,\nand goes like that, right?\n\n481\n00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:03.903\nSo it's gonna kinda move down those lines.\n\n482\n00:24:03.903 --> 00:24:07.914\nAnd you can see that, if I were to\ngo back to my DNS side here And\n\n483\n00:24:07.914 --> 00:24:11.858\nI'm gonna take itpro.tv and\nmove us up, on top of Google.\n\n484\n00:24:11.858 --> 00:24:14.030\nSo we're now gonna get priority.\n\n485\n00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.468\nAnd I'll Apply that.\n\n486\n00:24:15.468 --> 00:24:21.663\nAnd if I go back to my terminal, and\nI do the nslookup for www by itself,\n\n487\n00:24:21.663 --> 00:24:26.706\nthey don't know it,\nthen it looks for www.itpro.tv.\n\n488\n00:24:26.706 --> 00:24:28.442\nAnd here it goes, and\nit maps to our server.\n\n489\n00:24:28.442 --> 00:24:29.460\nSo that's what's going\non in the background.\n\n490\n00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.330\nAll right, now, the point being here\nis we can manually put this data in and\n\n491\n00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.590\nthat's great, but\nusually we don't have to.\n\n492\n00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.470\nNormally we come in here and\nwe just say use DHCP,\n\n493\n00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:44.015\nwe hit Apply, we're gonna get\nan address from the network and\n\n494\n00:24:44.015 --> 00:24:46.490\nit'll display that address right\nhere as soon as it gets it.\n\n495\n00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:49.961\nThere we go, and I got 10.1.230.132.\n\n496\n00:24:49.961 --> 00:24:52.490\nI got DNS Servers,\nI even got Search Domains.\n\n497\n00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.160\nShoot, I'm overriding my Search Domains.\n\n498\n00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.470\nYou can override DHCP, so\nwhen I go under DNS here,\n\n499\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:03.070\nthere settings are the ones\nthat I manually put in.\n\n500\n00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:07.030\nIf I go an remove those out, see how I hit\nminus twice and the numbers went away and\n\n501\n00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.890\nthen they all of a sudden\nreappeared again?\n\n502\n00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.067\nThese are the ones that\nare coming from DHCP now.\n\n503\n00:25:11.067 --> 00:25:14.553\nAnd same thing over here on the search\nsuffixes, if I delete those,\n\n504\n00:25:14.553 --> 00:25:17.133\nsee how studio.itpro.tv\nmagically appeared?\n\n505\n00:25:17.133 --> 00:25:19.338\nThat's the one that we're\ngetting from our server here.\n\n506\n00:25:19.338 --> 00:25:24.360\nSo I'm putting those back to\nwhere they should be, all right.\n\n507\n00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.910\nNow as far as configuring our network,\nyou need to find out,\n\n508\n00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.370\ndoes your network support\ndynamic addresses or not?\n\n509\n00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.581\nAnd if it doesn't, then you're gonna have\nto manually put your address in right\n\n510\n00:25:32.581 --> 00:25:34.260\nhere, and that's how we do it.\n\n511\n00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:39.750\nNow you might also have where, I plug\nin to the wired connection at home and\n\n512\n00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:44.310\nI have DHCP, and I plug into the wired\nconnection here and I don't.\n\n513\n00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.070\nI don't want to go in and edit my\nnetwork settings every time, and so\n\n514\n00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:49.830\nyou've got these locations up top.\n\n515\n00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.440\nWhere it says Automatic?\n\n516\n00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:56.990\nI can choose Edit Locations, and I could\ncreate a location here called Work.\n\n517\n00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:01.660\nAnd it's gonna remember based on what\nit sees on the network that this is\n\n518\n00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:06.530\nthe work building, and so here at Work,\nI might come in and set it to be manual.\n\n519\n00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:11.190\nAnd then tell it, hey when I'm here,\nthis is the address I want you to use.\n\n520\n00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:16.330\nI want you to use this address right here,\nand this router, and so on.\n\n521\n00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:21.320\nSo I define all that,\nand that's Work, okay?\n\n522\n00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.840\nAnd then I can do another location, and\n\n523\n00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:29.300\nI'll call this one Home, whoops,\nthat kinda crashed down on me there.\n\n524\n00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:35.234\nSo I'm gonna create another\nlocation that I will call Home.\n\n525\n00:26:35.234 --> 00:26:40.206\nAnd on the Home network, I can go to\nmy Thunderbolt Ethernet connection, and\n\n526\n00:26:40.206 --> 00:26:42.513\nI can set it to use DHCP, all right?\n\n527\n00:26:42.513 --> 00:26:45.911\nAnd it'll look at the network to be able\nto identify that, so the Mac will try and\n\n528\n00:26:45.911 --> 00:26:47.838\nfigure out which network it is on for\nyou, but\n\n529\n00:26:47.838 --> 00:26:50.110\nif I ever needed to I could\nalways come right in here.\n\n530\n00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.380\nAnd see how my Thunderbolt Ethernet\nis showing as using DHCP?\n\n531\n00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.419\nAnd then I can drop that and\nI can choose Work,\n\n532\n00:26:55.419 --> 00:26:57.147\nand now it just switched to Manually.\n\n533\n00:26:57.147 --> 00:26:59.828\nSo we can easily flip between manual and\ndynamic.\n\n534\n00:26:59.828 --> 00:27:04.299\n>> Don, since it's initial configurations,\nonce I get the operating system installed,\n\n535\n00:27:04.299 --> 00:27:05.630\nwhat is it gonna default?\n\n536\n00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.170\nIs it going to default one way or\nthe other?\n\n537\n00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.437\nWhether it's gonna be a dynamic\nassignment or a static assignment?\n\n538\n00:27:09.437 --> 00:27:11.178\n>> Yeah, it does DHCP by default, right.\n\n539\n00:27:11.178 --> 00:27:12.096\nSo, that's what I've got here.\n\n540\n00:27:12.096 --> 00:27:14.811\nThis other machine,\nthis is El Capitan stock install,\n\n541\n00:27:14.811 --> 00:27:16.501\nI haven't messed with anything.\n\n542\n00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:19.568\nYou see that Ethernet adapter\nthat's connected using DHCP, so\n\n543\n00:27:19.568 --> 00:27:23.340\nit's getting an address from the router\non that network and it's automatic.\n\n544\n00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.673\nNow on a wired connection,\nthat's all we've got,\n\n545\n00:27:25.673 --> 00:27:28.332\non a wireless connection\nthere's one more thing, right.\n\n546\n00:27:28.332 --> 00:27:31.559\nAnd it's a little bit different, so\nlet me jump back over here to my laptop.\n\n547\n00:27:31.559 --> 00:27:35.554\nActually let me just get back\nto the Automatic location.\n\n548\n00:27:35.554 --> 00:27:40.220\nAll right, so see where I've got my\nThunderbolt Ethernet connection.\n\n549\n00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.797\nNow it's gotta read a text, but\nit'll finish here in a second.\n\n550\n00:27:42.797 --> 00:27:45.370\nWhile we were dealing\nwith the IP addresses.\n\n551\n00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:46.262\nBut what about Wi-Fi?\n\n552\n00:27:46.262 --> 00:27:47.805\nWhen I click on Wi-Fi,\n\n553\n00:27:47.805 --> 00:27:52.751\nwhat you're gonna see over here is\nnothing about an IP address, all right?\n\n554\n00:27:52.751 --> 00:27:54.608\nAnd that's not because\nthere isn't an IP address.\n\n555\n00:27:54.608 --> 00:27:57.640\nOn a Wi-Fi network you have to have\nIP's just like on a wired network.\n\n556\n00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.040\nBut on a Wi-Fi network\nyou have one more step.\n\n557\n00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.704\nYou have to join the wireless network.\n\n558\n00:28:02.704 --> 00:28:05.780\nIt's advertising a name on the airwaves,\nright?\n\n559\n00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:09.564\nSo the radio frequency signals that are\npassing through your, through your brain,\n\n560\n00:28:09.564 --> 00:28:10.331\nmost of the time.\n\n561\n00:28:10.331 --> 00:28:13.976\n[LAUGH] You got a name assigned to that,\nand you've got to pick the name.\n\n562\n00:28:13.976 --> 00:28:15.881\nSo when I click on a Wi-Fi network,\n\n563\n00:28:15.881 --> 00:28:19.700\nthe first thing it's gonna ask me is\nwhich network I want to be a part of.\n\n564\n00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.000\nAnd so I'll have to join\nthe network that I want, and\n\n565\n00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.960\nif it's got a password it's gonna ask me\nthe password and I've got to put that in.\n\n566\n00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:31.280\nSo for example, if I were to, let me go\ninto my Advanced screen here real quick.\n\n567\n00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.250\nIf I were to remove this\nITProTV network for example.\n\n568\n00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.890\nThe first time that I join it,\nlet's see where is ITProTV, right here.\n\n569\n00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.330\nI'm just gonna remove\nthat network real quick.\n\n570\n00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:41.470\nAnd get that out of there.\n\n571\n00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:41.970\nRemove.\n\n572\n00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.840\nSlowly but surely.\n\n573\n00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.570\nThere we go.\n\n574\n00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.537\nSo, now, when I go to join a network,\n\n575\n00:28:49.537 --> 00:28:53.250\nI'm going to have to pick the network\nthat I want to connect to.\n\n576\n00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.078\nAnd it's going to ask me\nto provide a password.\n\n577\n00:28:56.078 --> 00:28:59.902\nSo if I want to join to ITProTV,\nI'll pick it, and\n\n578\n00:28:59.902 --> 00:29:03.925\neventually it's gonna prompt me for\nthe password.\n\n579\n00:29:03.925 --> 00:29:06.120\nI thought it might be off screen,\nbut there it is!\n\n580\n00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.370\nI'm just not being patient.\n\n581\n00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.550\nAnd so I need to give it a password\nto be able to join that.\n\n582\n00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.135\nSo I'm gonna punch in the password\nwhich I think I remember,\n\n583\n00:29:13.135 --> 00:29:16.015\nand then I'll be on that wireless network.\n\n584\n00:29:16.015 --> 00:29:17.365\nSo that's the first step.\n\n585\n00:29:17.365 --> 00:29:18.585\nYou don't have that with a wired network,\n\n586\n00:29:18.585 --> 00:29:20.465\nwired network you just plug in and\nyou're done.\n\n587\n00:29:20.465 --> 00:29:23.945\nOn a wireless network you've\ngotta join the wireless network.\n\n588\n00:29:23.945 --> 00:29:28.255\nBut once you've joined it, then you've\ngot your Advanced button down here.\n\n589\n00:29:28.255 --> 00:29:32.480\nAnd once you go into the Advanced button,\nand mine's still joining so\n\n590\n00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.760\nwe gotta wait a second.\n\n591\n00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.400\nYou'll notice my bars up here are all\ngrey which means I have no signal.\n\n592\n00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.500\nI'm not actually on\nthe wireless network yet.\n\n593\n00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.510\nIt's still trying to get connected for\nsome reason.\n\n594\n00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:47.190\nBut once you're in, you can go into the\nAdvanced settings of the WiFi networks.\n\n595\n00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:50.840\nAnd you'll see where you can\norganize the networks based on\n\n596\n00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:51.820\nwhich one's more important.\n\n597\n00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.240\nIf you have got more than\none network in the building,\n\n598\n00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.830\nyou can pick which one you wanna\njoin first over another one.\n\n599\n00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.340\nAnd then you've got a TCP/IP tab,\nand here's where you\n\n600\n00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:02.220\nhave the exact same settings as the wired\nside, but for your wireless network.\n\n601\n00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.412\nSo you've got DHCP or Manually,\nyou can specify your addresses,\n\n602\n00:30:05.412 --> 00:30:06.730\nwhether it's automatic.\n\n603\n00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.440\nYou can go to DNS and set those settings.\n\n604\n00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.030\nJust like we say on the wired,\n\n605\n00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.040\nit's just one more screen you've gotta\ngo through to get there, all right?\n\n606\n00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.470\nBut they're all, go to System Preferences,\ngo to Network, and\n\n607\n00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.200\nthat's gonna take to these screens.\n\n608\n00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.030\nEthernet, you get the IP settings\nright there once you click on it,\n\n609\n00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.860\nWiFi you just have to click on it and join\na network, and then go into Advanced, and\n\n610\n00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:28.010\nyou can set the IPs and so\non so, it's all right there.\n\n611\n00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.140\n>> Great information, we've been\nlooking at how to set up your initial\n\n612\n00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:32.840\nnetwork communications in this episode.\n\n613\n00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.730\nDon got anything else for us in this one?\n\n614\n00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.900\n>> That's about it on the network side,\nthere's a lot more in there.\n\n615\n00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.950\nWe'll see some of it in the server show if\nyou continue on to do our ACTC training.\n\n616\n00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.470\nWe'll talk about like setting up\nVPN Servers, and you come in and\n\n617\n00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.350\ncreate virtual network adaptors for\n\n618\n00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.700\nVPN's that's a really powerful\nthing you can do inside of there.\n\n619\n00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.740\nAnd then the Bluetooth functionality,\nthat all gets wrapped up into it also.\n\n620\n00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.630\nBut as far as the initial configuration\nof a Mac, Apple really just wants you to\n\n621\n00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:00.390\nunderstand IP address, Subnet mask,\ndefault gateway, and DNS Server,\n\n622\n00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:03.060\nthose four kind of things that we need\nto punch in to get the system working,\n\n623\n00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.310\nand then the difference between wired and\nwireless.\n\n624\n00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.370\n>> All right, very good.\n\n625\n00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:09.685\nWell, it looks like we've come to the end\nof another exciting episode here at\n\n626\n00:31:09.685 --> 00:31:11.730\nITProTV, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n627\n00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.180\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n628\n00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:13.840\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n629\n00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.087\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n630\n00:31:16.087 --> 00:31:23.420\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.620\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.960\nAnd, in today's episode, we're gonna\nbe moving along in our Apple certified\n\n5\n00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.925\nsupport professional, and we're actually\ncoming back to you with a part three.\n\n6\n00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:26.370\nYes, couldn't get all that information\nin part one or a part two,\n\n7\n00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.130\nso this is going to be\nthe third part in this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.280\nWe got none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet to help us out.\n\n9\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.430\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.460\n>> I'm doing great, Wes, and ready to\ncontinue with our initial configuration.\n\n11\n00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.000\nSo, we've been talking about it in\nthe first two parts what we need to do on\n\n12\n00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.010\na brand new Mac to kind of get it\nset up to the way that we want it.\n\n13\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.390\nAnd, so we took a look at\nways that we could cheat and\n\n14\n00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.600\njust bring our settings from other\ncomputers, we took a look at configuring\n\n15\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.000\nthe network adapter, so we'd be able to\nget onto the network and start to work.\n\n16\n00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.210\nBut, now we're just gonna take a look at\nsome more general type settings around our\n\n17\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.800\nMac and\nstuff that we might need to configure.\n\n18\n00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.660\nSo, this is all pretty important.\n\n19\n00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.660\nOne thing that we haven't covered yet\nis that when you do brand new install of\n\n20\n00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.990\nOS 10, the first time you power it on\nthere's a little wizard that runs.\n\n21\n00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.470\nIt's called the set up assistant.\n\n22\n00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.170\nAnd, the set up assistant actually helps\nyou get some defaults in place and so\n\n23\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.180\nit is important to recognize.\n\n24\n00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.070\nNow, you only see the set\nup assistant once.\n\n25\n00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.250\nWhen you first boot up that brand\nnew install of El Capitan or\n\n26\n00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.780\nwhatever version of OS 10 and\nit walks you through the steps.\n\n27\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.056\nAfter you've done it, you never\nsee the setup assistant againm so\n\n28\n00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:26.090\nit's not a tool we can normally reference.\n\n29\n00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.320\nI've got a virtual machine here fired\nup that just finished its install, and\n\n30\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.970\nthis is the setup assistant.\n\n31\n00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.790\nMany of you have probably seen it before.\n\n32\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.730\nIt starts off just by asking,\nwhat language do you speak?\n\n33\n00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.510\nRight?\n[LAUGH] Because it\n\n34\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.670\nwants the user interface to be\nin the right language for you.\n\n35\n00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.070\nSo, you can go through and\npick your country, and\n\n36\n00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.130\nthat's going to have it localize it,\nas far as the language,\n\n37\n00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.410\nthe monetary symbol,\nthe currency symbol, that kind of stuff.\n\n38\n00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.810\nIt will get all that set right, so I'm\njust going to choose the United States.\n\n39\n00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.410\nAnd, I'll continue forward.\n\n40\n00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.050\nThen, it's gonna ask\nus about our keyboard.\n\n41\n00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.370\nIs our keyboard a French keyboard, or\n\n42\n00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.600\na Dvorak keyboard,\nif you have one of those crazy things.\n\n43\n00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.500\nBut, here I just have a standard U.S.\nlayout versus Canadian English,\n\n44\n00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.840\nwhich I think is the same layout honestly,\nbut apparently they differentiate.\n\n45\n00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.270\nIf you choose show all,\n\n46\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.950\nyou'll see all the other ones that\nare out there and there's a ton.\n\n47\n00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.880\nI've used French keyboards.\n\n48\n00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.950\nThere's the Dvorak keyboards\nI was talking about.\n\n49\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.920\nSo, there's all sorts of different\nones that are out there but\n\n50\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.460\nI'm just gonna go US today.\n\n51\n00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.310\n>> So, with a Dvorak keyboard,\nthey put it in there for\n\n52\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.190\nlike five people in the world\nthat use that keyboard?\n\n53\n00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.790\n>> That's right.\n\n54\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.610\n>> Gotcha.\n>> People say it's fast.\n\n55\n00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.780\nAll right, then we get transfer\ninformation to this Mac.\n\n56\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.830\nThis should look familiar,\nthis is the migration assistant.\n\n57\n00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.650\nThe set up assistant is actually\nlaunching the migration assistant to say,\n\n58\n00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.950\nhey if you want to migrate your\ndata over here's your chance.\n\n59\n00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.290\nFrom a Mac, from a PC,\nfrom a time machine back up, but\n\n60\n00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.470\nthe default is don't\ntransfer information now.\n\n61\n00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.680\nWe can launch this migration assistant\nwhenever we want, so we can always do it\n\n62\n00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.990\nafter the fact but it's giving us\nthe chance to do it right now.\n\n63\n00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.990\nI'm going to say no.\n\n64\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.170\nThen, whether I want\nlocation service enabled.\n\n65\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.330\nIf your Mac has a GPS in it or\n\n66\n00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.950\nhas wireless in general,\nit can use that to find your device, and\n\n67\n00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.620\nit's cool because you can go to web pages\nand it will show you the weather for\n\n68\n00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.450\nyour own area and stuff, but\nit's also cool to use find my Mac.\n\n69\n00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.000\nIf you've lost your laptop and\nwant to figure out where it is,\n\n70\n00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.690\nthe location services turned on, you can\nfind the last place it reported in from.\n\n71\n00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.700\nYou may not want that if you're\na privacy advocate you can turn it off,\n\n72\n00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.100\nin my case I'm gonna leave it I'll leave\nit off cuz I'm in a virtual machine it\n\n73\n00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.410\nwon't work anyway.\n\n74\n00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.520\nSo, I'll continue forward and\nit's just reminding you, hey are you\n\n75\n00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.840\nsure cuz if you want find my Mac it's\nnot gonna work unless you turn this on.\n\n76\n00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.450\nI'm gonna say okay on that, and\nwe can always turn it on again later.\n\n77\n00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.940\nThen, it's gonna ask me to\nsign in with my Apple ID.\n\n78\n00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.660\nThis is important because if I have an\nApple ID I can sign in to my laptop with\n\n79\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.430\nit, and all my documents are stored in\niCloud automatically synced down from end,\n\n80\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.090\nand my notes, and my email accounts,\nand all the other stuff will syncdown.\n\n81\n00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.470\nIt's a great way to get your laptop or\n\n82\n00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.310\ndesktop set up really fast cuz all\nthose settings are stored up in iCloud.\n\n83\n00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.830\nSo, if you've got an Apple ID, you can\npunch that information in right now,\n\n84\n00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.770\nand it will get you set up for all of\nthose different services, all right?\n\n85\n00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.320\nI'm gonna not sign in with that,\nand I'll just finish that up.\n\n86\n00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.920\nAnd, then when we're done we just\nhave a license agreement and\n\n87\n00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.150\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n88\n00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.210\nSo, the setup assistance's not super\namazing, it's just designed to get\n\n89\n00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.360\nyou through those basic setting to\nget your system up and configured.\n\n90\n00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.390\nIt's also going to ask me to create a user\naccount so I can specify an account for\n\n91\n00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.900\nmyself, and\nwhatever my password is going to be.\n\n92\n00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.700\nAnd, we can finish that up, and\n\n93\n00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.010\nI think that's the last thing\nthat it does if I remember right.\n\n94\n00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.590\nAnd, once that's done it's\ngonna compete the install and\n\n95\n00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.090\nthen the system will be back up and going.\n\n96\n00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.340\nAnd one more thing,\nit's gotta ask me for my time zone.\n\n97\n00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.700\nSo, I'll go ahead and tell it that I'm\nin Florida, Eastern daylight time,\n\n98\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.680\ngetting that time setup right.\n\n99\n00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.560\nThis other screen here is asking\nabout diagnostics and usage.\n\n100\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.460\nSo, this is when you use your Mac,\nit reports information back to Apple.\n\n101\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.760\nThey like to keep track of who uses\nwhat programs to know what's popular,\n\n102\n00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.290\nwhat hardware they're selling,\nwhere it's actually getting used.\n\n103\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.490\nBut, they also like to\nkeep track of crashes.\n\n104\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.210\nIf a crash happens, you can report\nyour crash data back to Apple, and\n\n105\n00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.730\nthey can use that to try and\nfix it for the next release.\n\n106\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.790\nYou can turn these things on and off.\n\n107\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.840\nAll right?\nThe key thing to remember is that\n\n108\n00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.350\nyou've got send diagnostics and\nusage data to Apple, and\n\n109\n00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.060\nshare crash data with app developers.\n\n110\n00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.430\nThat second one is sharing data\nwith people who aren't Apple,\n\n111\n00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.730\nthird parties, and you may not want that.\n\n112\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.600\nYou may be okay with Apple,\nyou trust them, but\n\n113\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.510\nthis one is making you trust anybody\nwho has an app in the App Store, and\n\n114\n00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.410\nso you have to decide whether or\nnot that's something you wanna do.\n\n115\n00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.950\nAll right,\nafter that it's setting up my Mac.\n\n116\n00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.930\nSo, that's the last of it,\nit's gonna apply those settings and\n\n117\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.500\nget this Mac up and going.\n\n118\n00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.150\nAnd, when it's done, we'll be at\na default El Capitan type install and\n\n119\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.600\nthat's what I'm seeing right here.\n\n120\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.080\nIt's default, it's ready to go.\n\n121\n00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.480\nIf I had logged in with an Apple ID\nit wouldn't so much be a default.\n\n122\n00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.290\nWe would start to see our iCloud drive,\nwe have some settings come down,\n\n123\n00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.930\nwe have our keychains,\nour passwords would be remembered,\n\n124\n00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.790\nall that stuff would come out of iCloud\nand that gets us ahead on those settings.\n\n125\n00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:04.650\nThanks.\n\n126\n00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.900\n>> Don, now what if you work for\na company, you've got predefined settings,\n\n127\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.840\nsettings that you know that\nyour company already has,\n\n128\n00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.990\nand maybe wants to put in place.\n\n129\n00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.030\nDo we have a technology that we could push\nout settings that are already predefined?\n\n130\n00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.510\n>> Yeah, a lot of companies do this.\n\n131\n00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.610\nIf you watched our Mac Management Basics\nseries, we did a whole episode on,\n\n132\n00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.490\nI think we did two episodes,\non the Profile Manager.\n\n133\n00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.750\nThe Profile Manager is a part\nof the OS 10 Server app\n\n134\n00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.860\nthat lets you build\nconfiguration profiles, and\n\n135\n00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.590\nyou can push those out to your clients to\nautomatically configure them how you want.\n\n136\n00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.540\nWell, on this exam they don't really\ntackle the profile manager, but\n\n137\n00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.660\nthey do want you to understand what\nthese configuration profiles are.\n\n138\n00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.050\nAnd, what they basically are is just a\nLittle file that you can download that has\n\n139\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.590\nthe settings defined in it.\n\n140\n00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.980\nSo, in your company you might say,\n\n141\n00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.410\nhey, I want everybody to have a\nscreensaver that kicks on at ten minutes,\n\n142\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.700\nthat has a password policy that requires\nyou to change your password every 60 days.\n\n143\n00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.120\nThey have all these settings they wanna\napply, but they don't wanna do it over and\n\n144\n00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.470\nover and over again.\n\n145\n00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.090\nSo, they can create a configuration\nprofile and they created in a server app.\n\n146\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.990\nLet me show you here real quick.\n\n147\n00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.798\nThis part you don't need to know for the\nexam, just for your own personal benefit.\n\n148\n00:07:07.798 --> 00:07:09.270\nIn the server app,\nyou have the profile manager and\n\n149\n00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.540\nthe profile manager is actually\ngot a web interface that you use.\n\n150\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.810\nThe center face that's about to come up,\nand\n\n151\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.250\nwhen you log in into it you can\nstart to create custom settings.\n\n152\n00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.390\nSo, let's say for\nexample that I wanted to have desktops and\n\n153\n00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.210\nhave them all set up a certain way.\n\n154\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:33.330\nSo, I could create a device group called\ndesktops, and in this desktops group\n\n155\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:38.140\nI can go into its settings I can\nstart to customize those settings.\n\n156\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.960\nI can specify all sorts of things.\n\n157\n00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.097\nI mentioned password policies,\nso I can come in here and\n\n158\n00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:48.597\nset a password policy where I require\nthe password to be reset every sixty days.\n\n159\n00:07:48.597 --> 00:07:50.351\nSo, I can punch that in.\n\n160\n00:07:50.351 --> 00:07:52.419\nI can go and change the networking side.\n\n161\n00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:54.145\nIf I want to configure network settings.\n\n162\n00:07:54.145 --> 00:07:58.236\nI can specify a particular\nwireless network to join.\n\n163\n00:07:58.236 --> 00:08:02.560\nSo I want them to join\nthe ITProTV wireless network, and\n\n164\n00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.500\nI want them to Auto Join.\n\n165\n00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:10.300\nAnd I can tell that, hey, it's a WPA2\nnetwork, and you're gonna need a passcode.\n\n166\n00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.780\nI can punch the passcode in here, and\n\n167\n00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.590\nthat way I don't have to tell\npeople the wireless passcode.\n\n168\n00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.741\nI can just load this configuration profile\nand I'll automatically be set up for\n\n169\n00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:21.053\nthat network without having\nto know what the password is.\n\n170\n00:08:21.053 --> 00:08:24.048\nThere's other things that you can\napply as we kinda scroll through here,\n\n171\n00:08:24.048 --> 00:08:26.766\nlike security and privacy is what\nI was talking about a moment ago.\n\n172\n00:08:26.766 --> 00:08:28.290\nThat you can come in here and\n\n173\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.550\ndefine things like whether you wanna\nsend that usage data to Apple.\n\n174\n00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:36.600\nMaybe I don't want people sending\nmy usage data to Apple or\n\n175\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.190\nI want to restrict them to only running\napps that come out of App Store.\n\n176\n00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.250\nYou can set all of this\nstuff however you want.\n\n177\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.975\nAll these configuration studies,\nyou get put in place and it's a lot.\n\n178\n00:08:45.975 --> 00:08:49.500\nThere's a lot of stuff and\nyou can define printers for them to use.\n\n179\n00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.370\nYou can define whether or not they're\nallowed to go in system preferences,\n\n180\n00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.600\nsystem identification,\njust a ton of different things.\n\n181\n00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.650\nAnd when you get it all setup\njust the way that you want it.\n\n182\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.940\nWhat's gonna happen is,\nafter it has saved at least,\n\n183\n00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.090\nthis little Download button will light up,\nthat little inches lit up.\n\n184\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.130\nAnd you can hit that Download button and\n\n185\n00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.200\nit will download our configuration\nprofile, a little file.\n\n186\n00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.020\nAnd the file, that easy to spot,\nlet me go back to my client here.\n\n187\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.380\nI've gotta couple of those\nfiles sitting right here.\n\n188\n00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.250\nSo I've got Settings for laptops and\na Trust Profile for the profile manager.\n\n189\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.312\nAnd see how the files just\nend in .mobileconfig?\n\n190\n00:09:25.312 --> 00:09:27.995\nMobileconfig, that lets me know\nthis is a configuration profile.\n\n191\n00:09:27.995 --> 00:09:30.291\nAnd if I wanna get this\nlaptop set up quickly,\n\n192\n00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:32.440\nI just need to load these profiles.\n\n193\n00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.260\nAnd when I load them, it's now gonna\nbe configured with those settings.\n\n194\n00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.840\nAnd so I might have it set up where it\n\n195\n00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.900\nhas a screen saver that kicks on after\nfive minutes, or requires a password.\n\n196\n00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.570\nAnd all I have to do is come in here and\nrun this file.\n\n197\n00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.450\nNow, I need to trust\nthe Profile Manager first.\n\n198\n00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.873\nSo I'm gonna click on this trust one,\nand we'll just load that one in.\n\n199\n00:09:49.873 --> 00:09:54.324\nSo I'm gonna load it in and\nyou have to be an administrator to do it,\n\n200\n00:09:54.324 --> 00:09:55.602\nso we'll do that.\n\n201\n00:09:55.602 --> 00:09:59.456\nAnd then now, that I trust that profile\nserver, I can load my settings for\n\n202\n00:09:59.456 --> 00:10:00.630\nthe laptop.\n\n203\n00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.940\nAnd so I'm gonna click to install that and\nit just installed and so\n\n204\n00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.440\nI see settings for laptop loaded,\nand what I turned on here,\n\n205\n00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.890\nthere's this one feature\nthat I always use on a Mac.\n\n206\n00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:15.170\nSo, if we take a look at this stock\ninstall, and I go to System Preferences\n\n207\n00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.280\nthere's an accessibility feature that\nyou zoom with your scroll wheel,\n\n208\n00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.890\nand I use it all the time.\n\n209\n00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.220\nYou guys have seen me use it on the show.\n\n210\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.310\nAnytime you see me like zoom in like this,\n\n211\n00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.460\nthat's this accessibility\nfeature that I love.\n\n212\n00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.090\nIf you go under Zoom,\nyou'll see it right here.\n\n213\n00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.920\nUse scroll gesture with modifier keys\nto zoom and it's turned off by default.\n\n214\n00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.160\nWell, when I loaded the configuration\nprofile over here, say,\n\n215\n00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.520\nit's got one accessibility setting,\nEnable Scroll Zoom True,\n\n216\n00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.440\nthat's what I just turned on,\nI've pushed that setting out.\n\n217\n00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.500\nSo, when I get a new computer, I can\njust run this configuration profile, and\n\n218\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.790\nit'll automatically set that up for me.\n\n219\n00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:54.130\nIf I go into my System Preferences,\nand I go into Accessibility and\n\n220\n00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.920\nI go into Zoom, see how use use gesture\ncontrol with modifier keys is turned on.\n\n221\n00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.316\nThat's not the default and,\nI can't turn it off.\n\n222\n00:11:02.316 --> 00:11:06.918\nConfiguration profiles lock the settings,\nso the user can't change it, right?\n\n223\n00:11:06.918 --> 00:11:10.198\nSo if you work for a school or\nbusiness or somebody and you wanna\n\n224\n00:11:10.198 --> 00:11:14.503\nconsistently roll out all your devices to\nhave them all configured the same way.\n\n225\n00:11:14.503 --> 00:11:16.582\nYou can use configuration\nprofiles to do that.\n\n226\n00:11:16.582 --> 00:11:20.895\nYou can have a hundred settings in there,\nit applies them all at once, and\n\n227\n00:11:20.895 --> 00:11:22.295\nit locks them in place.\n\n228\n00:11:22.295 --> 00:11:25.634\n>> One of the things that you did mention\nabout using the profile manager is that it\n\n229\n00:11:25.634 --> 00:11:26.696\ndoes make a simplicity,\n\n230\n00:11:26.696 --> 00:11:29.090\nit makes administration\neasier on multiple machines.\n\n231\n00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.600\nNow Don, I've noticed that\nyou just kinda went back to,\n\n232\n00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.140\nthe whole sneakernet decentralized and\ninstalled that file locally.\n\n233\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.908\nIs there a way to make it a little bit\neasier, if you have more than one machine?\n\n234\n00:11:37.908 --> 00:11:43.000\n>> Absolutely, this exam doesn't hit on\nit, but the Mac Management Basics 1 does.\n\n235\n00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.712\nAnd so, if you really wanna learn more\nabout it, jump over to that show, and\n\n236\n00:11:46.712 --> 00:11:49.676\nI show in there how you can set\nup the Profile Manager Server.\n\n237\n00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:53.231\nAnd how you can connect to it over\nthe network and you can actually make\n\n238\n00:11:53.231 --> 00:11:57.167\nit where the administrator doesn't\neven have to touch the remote machine.\n\n239\n00:11:57.167 --> 00:12:00.016\nThey just sit down in the profile\nmanager and they push the profile out to\n\n240\n00:12:00.016 --> 00:12:02.791\nthe clients and so you can have\na thousand computers on your network.\n\n241\n00:12:02.791 --> 00:12:06.220\nAnd you can push the setting, all at\nonce right after all thousand machines,\n\n242\n00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.840\nyou get them all set up the same way,\nit's really powerful stuff.\n\n243\n00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.620\nOn this exam though, what they want\nyou to know about are these files.\n\n244\n00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.780\nNow, that's why I did it the old school\nway where you just copy the file over.\n\n245\n00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.180\nThat file, you just double click on it.\n\n246\n00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.160\nIt installs, and\n\n247\n00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.730\nonce that it's installed, all the settings\nare configured exactly how you want.\n\n248\n00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.230\nSo if I know that I'm gonna be\ngetting a new laptop next week,\n\n249\n00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.950\nI could actually have a configuration\nfile that already had all my settings in.\n\n250\n00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.800\nAnd when I get the new laptop,\nI just double click on this file and\n\n251\n00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.840\neverything gets set the way that I want.\n\n252\n00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.179\nSo it definitely speeds things up for\nthat initial configuration.\n\n253\n00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.480\nAll right, so that's configuration\nprofiles, we also saw the setup assistant.\n\n254\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.770\nWe've got a few other things.\n\n255\n00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.150\nNow, one thing I wanna spend some time on,\nis the system preferences screen.\n\n256\n00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.790\nWhen you go into System Preferences,\nwhat are you looking at?\n\n257\n00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.170\nSo when I go to my Apple menu and\n\n258\n00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.610\nI go to System Preferences,\nthere's a lot of icons in here.\n\n259\n00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.310\nAnd, one thing that you might\nnot immediately notice,\n\n260\n00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.070\nis that they're actually arranged\nin a very specific order.\n\n261\n00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.859\nI didn't realize this myself.\n\n262\n00:13:04.859 --> 00:13:07.438\nI had been using OS 10 for\nyears, and never realized how\n\n263\n00:13:07.438 --> 00:13:10.953\nthis was organized until I was reading\nin a textbook, and it explained that.\n\n264\n00:13:10.953 --> 00:13:13.210\nI was like, yeah, I never noticed that.\n\n265\n00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:17.530\nBut if you look at the System Preferences,\nsee how there's these different colors?\n\n266\n00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.790\nI've got a light gray here, and\nthen a darker gray here, and\n\n267\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.450\na lighter gray here,\nand a darker gray here.\n\n268\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.200\nEach one is a different collection of\nutilities that are grouped together\n\n269\n00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.850\nbecause they serve a similar purpose.\n\n270\n00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.222\nNow, the reason I never noticed,\nis that I rarely hunt for what I want.\n\n271\n00:13:33.222 --> 00:13:36.009\nIf I know I'm gonna be configuring\nnetworking I can just come into\n\n272\n00:13:36.009 --> 00:13:37.690\nSystem Preferences and type network.\n\n273\n00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.384\nAnd it finds it for me, and then I can\njust click right on it and go, right?\n\n274\n00:13:41.384 --> 00:13:44.070\nSo that spotlight search\nis really helpful.\n\n275\n00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.170\nAnd notice when I did it,\nsee how Users & Groups is lit up but\n\n276\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:48.791\nit's not the same as this one?\n\n277\n00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:52.300\nThis was a big bright circle because\nthey're pretty certain that's\n\n278\n00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.092\nthe one I want.\n\n279\n00:13:53.092 --> 00:13:57.990\nThe name matches what I typed, but\nthere's other utilities that come close.\n\n280\n00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:02.040\nIf I go into Users & Groups,\nI can configure a network logon server.\n\n281\n00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.660\nSo the word network is in there, but\n\n282\n00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.380\nit gets a light circle because it's\nnot as good a match as this one.\n\n283\n00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.620\nSo it's helped me find out what's\nmore close to what I want and so\n\n284\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:16.520\nit's showing all those different settings\nit found based on what my search was.\n\n285\n00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.727\nAnd you search for anything, so\nlike that zoom, if I forget it's under\n\n286\n00:14:19.727 --> 00:14:22.780\nAccessibility, when I type zoom,\nsee the mouse kind of lights up.\n\n287\n00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.846\nBut then Accessibility down\nhere lights up also, so\n\n288\n00:14:25.846 --> 00:14:29.966\nI know that either of those tools\nmay contain what I'm searching for.\n\n289\n00:14:29.966 --> 00:14:33.530\nAll right, but let's get back to\nthe grey areas that I was talking about.\n\n290\n00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.840\nI'm gonna just resize this window a little\nbit, so it's a little easier to see.\n\n291\n00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.070\nWell, I say I'm gonna resize it.\n\n292\n00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.450\nIt's not gonna let me resize this thing.\n\n293\n00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.470\nApparently, I've done something to my\nmouse and it's not gonna let me resize.\n\n294\n00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.076\nAll right, well,\nwe'll stick with the way it is.\n\n295\n00:14:46.076 --> 00:14:49.254\nThat first area up here,\nthis light grey one, okay.\n\n296\n00:14:49.254 --> 00:14:51.230\nThat's what we called personal.\n\n297\n00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.300\nThese are the personal settings.\n\n298\n00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:58.450\nEvery icon up here represent a setting\nthat really applies to you personally.\n\n299\n00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.680\nThese are the things that your average\nend user should be to configure.\n\n300\n00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.690\nSo your average end user might wanna\nchange their desktop wallpaper or\n\n301\n00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.750\nthey might wanna change their screensaver.\n\n302\n00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.780\nThey might wanna change some general\nsettings over what shows up in the finder\n\n303\n00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.200\nor what color the bars\nare on their screen.\n\n304\n00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.014\nThese personal settings\napply to your account.\n\n305\n00:15:17.265 --> 00:15:19.955\nI might have two or\nthree user accounts on this computer.\n\n306\n00:15:19.955 --> 00:15:23.995\nThey each could have different wallpapers,\ndifferent themes for their bars,\n\n307\n00:15:23.995 --> 00:15:27.615\ndifferent finder settings,\nall different settings based on them.\n\n308\n00:15:27.615 --> 00:15:29.405\nIt's personal to their account.\n\n309\n00:15:29.405 --> 00:15:32.610\nThere's one exception, and\nthat's the Security & Privacy.\n\n310\n00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.750\nWhen you go into Security & Privacy,\nthere's certain things,\n\n311\n00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.018\nlike the OS10 firewall and\nthe FileVault hard drive encryption.\n\n312\n00:15:39.018 --> 00:15:43.420\nThose are turned on for the system as\na whole, that'll affect all of your users,\n\n313\n00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.604\nnot just you, okay?\n\n314\n00:15:44.604 --> 00:15:48.660\nBut the other settings that are up here\nare personal, they're just tied to you.\n\n315\n00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.346\nWhat is your personal preference for\nhow Notifications work?\n\n316\n00:15:51.346 --> 00:15:53.046\nOr personal preference for the Spotlight?\n\n317\n00:15:53.046 --> 00:15:55.346\nAnd it does just apply to your account, so\n\n318\n00:15:55.346 --> 00:15:59.833\nthey call this the personal section After\nthat we get into the hardware section.\n\n319\n00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:03.878\nSo the hardware section is next, and it's\nkinda easy to spot, cuz you see CDs and\n\n320\n00:16:03.878 --> 00:16:09.160\nDVDs, Displays, Keyboard, Trackpad, Mouse,\nthis is hardware you attach to your Mac.\n\n321\n00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.415\nSome of it, though, like Ink,\nwhat's that all about?\n\n322\n00:16:12.415 --> 00:16:15.815\nWell, it's software, but\nsoftware designed to interact with a pen,\n\n323\n00:16:15.815 --> 00:16:16.865\nif you have a pen device.\n\n324\n00:16:16.865 --> 00:16:19.707\nSo you have a Wacom tablet, or\nmaybe you're on an iPad Pro, for\n\n325\n00:16:19.707 --> 00:16:21.918\nexample, you've gotta have a pencil for\nthat.\n\n326\n00:16:21.918 --> 00:16:24.959\nBut it's got settings for\nhow it interacts with those.\n\n327\n00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:29.405\nEnergy Saver, now it's not a device\nI've attached, but the device itself.\n\n328\n00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:32.445\nDo I want it to go to sleep\nafter 15 minutes of being idle.\n\n329\n00:16:32.445 --> 00:16:37.310\nDo I want it to require a password\nafter the screen saver,\n\n330\n00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.060\nthat kind of stuff is right\nhere under energy saver.\n\n331\n00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.040\nHow I want that to be.\n\n332\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.410\nDo I want the hard drives to go to sleep?\n\n333\n00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:44.560\nThat's all a part of that.\n\n334\n00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.125\nSo this is configurations\nsurrounding my hardware.\n\n335\n00:16:48.185 --> 00:16:51.125\nThen, you've got Internet and wireless.\n\n336\n00:16:51.125 --> 00:16:53.205\nSo Internet and\nwireless is this next section.\n\n337\n00:16:53.205 --> 00:16:55.916\nAnd these are all tools that\nrelate to your Internet access or\n\n338\n00:16:55.916 --> 00:16:58.481\nyour wireless configuration,\nso you'll see Network.\n\n339\n00:16:58.481 --> 00:17:01.411\nNetwork is where we went in\nthe last episode to actually\n\n340\n00:17:01.411 --> 00:17:05.848\nget us connected to the network and\nconfigure that, but they're sharing.\n\n341\n00:17:05.848 --> 00:17:09.188\nIf I wanna share files and folders on\nthe network so other people can access it.\n\n342\n00:17:09.188 --> 00:17:10.440\nIf I wanna share my screen,\n\n343\n00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.860\nany of that stuff that I wanna configure\nthat's all right here under sharing.\n\n344\n00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.860\nIt's network related.\n\n345\n00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.260\nYou've also got Extensions any\nadd-ons that you're using to increase\n\n346\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.680\nthe functionality of your system.\n\n347\n00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.850\nYou can do various actions.\n\n348\n00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:25.170\nYour Share Menu, which is why\nthis gets thrown under Internet.\n\n349\n00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.530\nIf I'm viewing a webpage and\nwanna send it out to someone via Twitter.\n\n350\n00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.650\nI can add a twitter account and\nit'll show up here, so\n\n351\n00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.960\nthat is kind of network and Internet.\n\n352\n00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.470\nWe've also got our Internet Accounts.\n\n353\n00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.220\nThese are things like your email accounts,\nTwitter, Facebook,\n\n354\n00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.090\nany of the other things that you\nwanna interact with on your system.\n\n355\n00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:42.080\nYou can set those all up right here.\n\n356\n00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.680\nYou see I don't have any added,\nbut iCloud wold be the normal one,\n\n357\n00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.940\nif you're just a home user.\n\n358\n00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.111\nBut we use Exchange here at ITProTV, so\nI might add my Exchange server in so\n\n359\n00:17:49.111 --> 00:17:52.508\nI can send things to my calendar, or have\nit show up as part of the Mac calendar.\n\n360\n00:17:52.508 --> 00:17:57.430\nAnd then the other one is\nthe important one, iCloud.\n\n361\n00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:01.420\niCloud was under Internet Accounts, but\nit's also under the iCloud icon itself.\n\n362\n00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.531\nThe difference is,\nif I go into the iCloud icon itself,\n\n363\n00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:07.680\nI'm gonna attach iCloud\nto my user accounts.\n\n364\n00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.149\nSo when I login to my system,\nI'm logging in with iCloud.\n\n365\n00:18:10.149 --> 00:18:14.648\nIf I set it up under Internet Accounts,\nI'm still logging in with a local account\n\n366\n00:18:14.648 --> 00:18:18.564\non my machine, but now I can access\nmy cloud, calendar, my storage.\n\n367\n00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:21.484\nAnd other things without it taking\nover my local user account, but\n\n368\n00:18:21.484 --> 00:18:24.650\notherwise, the functionality\nis pretty much the same.\n\n369\n00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.540\nSo that's the Network and\nInternet section.\n\n370\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.440\nThen the last section,\nI'm gonna call the last section but\n\n371\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.250\nactually there's one more.\n\n372\n00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.570\nBut last section that you're\nguaranteed to have is system.\n\n373\n00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.750\nSystem, the user settings that\napplied to the computer as a whole and\n\n374\n00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.450\nwill effect every user.\n\n375\n00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.120\nSo you've got Users & Groups,\nwe're we go to create users.\n\n376\n00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.950\nYou've got Parental Controls,\nwhere you can lock users down.\n\n377\n00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.930\nOur App Store, which is pretty important,\nI'll talk more about it in a minute.\n\n378\n00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.830\nWe've got Date & Time, Startup Disk,\n\n379\n00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.610\nAccessibility, each one of\nthese has a different function.\n\n380\n00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.090\nSo for example, Startup Disk.\n\n381\n00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.950\nWhen I boot the computer up,\nwhat hard drive do I boot up from?\n\n382\n00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.931\nWell, I probably only have one hard drive,\nso there's not a lot of choices there.\n\n383\n00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:03.244\nBut if I've got boot camp installed,\nI might have a Window's partition and\n\n384\n00:19:03.244 --> 00:19:04.072\na Mac partition and\n\n385\n00:19:04.072 --> 00:19:07.363\nI can use the Startup Disk to figure\nout which one I wanna boot from, right?\n\n386\n00:19:07.363 --> 00:19:10.336\nMaybe I wanna boot to Windows by default,\nso I can go and do that.\n\n387\n00:19:10.336 --> 00:19:14.729\nDate & Time, it's important to have the\nright time on your system and the default\n\n388\n00:19:14.729 --> 00:19:18.370\nsettings it's gonna synchronize\nthe time against Apple servers.\n\n389\n00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.180\nSo that is what it's set to here, but\n\n390\n00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.750\nthe administrator can override\nthis in manually set the clock.\n\n391\n00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.550\nBut there's only one clock on\nthe system that affects every user so\n\n392\n00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.690\nthat's why it's here under\nthe system settings.\n\n393\n00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.250\nAnd then we've got Accessibility.\n\n394\n00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:35.702\nAccessibility is pretty important, if you\nhave any kind of disability or impairment,\n\n395\n00:19:35.702 --> 00:19:40.230\nApple has a whole suite of utilities that\nwe can turn on to improve your experience.\n\n396\n00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.090\nI mentioned Zoom, for example.\n\n397\n00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:46.910\nSo let's say you have impaired vision and\nmaybe you're not necessarily legally blind\n\n398\n00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.500\nbut you are, well,\nyou might be legally blind, I don't know.\n\n399\n00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.400\nYou just can't necessarily read\nthe text on the screen, it's too small.\n\n400\n00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.120\nThat's how I use it most of the time.\n\n401\n00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.660\nI can turn on that zoom functionality and\nnow I can make it nice and big and\n\n402\n00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.540\nread what that is.\n\n403\n00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.102\nThese modern monitors,\nthese retina displays,\n\n404\n00:20:01.102 --> 00:20:05.006\nhave such a high resolution that Apple\nnormally does high DPI scaling to make\n\n405\n00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:07.277\nsure that everything shows up nice and\nbig.\n\n406\n00:20:07.277 --> 00:20:12.030\nBut for whatever reason, Apple hates\n1920 x 1080, so if you hook a non-Apple\n\n407\n00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:16.085\nmonitor up and it goes to the 1080p\nresolution that most systems use.\n\n408\n00:20:16.085 --> 00:20:18.405\nIt ends up really small and\nhard to see, and\n\n409\n00:20:18.405 --> 00:20:20.980\nyou can kinda see that here on my desktop.\n\n410\n00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.310\nSo here I am on my desktop, and\n\n411\n00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.830\nif I start to browse into my finder,\nlook how small that is.\n\n412\n00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.560\nI can't even read that.\n\n413\n00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.900\nSo having that zoom functionality\nkinda helps out with that for\n\n414\n00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.020\na visual impairment.\n\n415\n00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.624\nBut they have other things that go\nbeyond that, things like Captions,\n\n416\n00:20:35.624 --> 00:20:37.376\nif you have a hearing impairment.\n\n417\n00:20:37.376 --> 00:20:41.400\nThe system makes a warning bell,\nlike a ding.\n\n418\n00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.660\nWell, if you're deaf, you can't hear that.\n\n419\n00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.330\nSo I can turn on Captions, and now\ninstead of making the ding noise, well,\n\n420\n00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.800\nit still makes the ding noise,\nbut in addition,\n\n421\n00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.300\nit lays a subtitle on the screen like\nthis, so that you know a ding happened.\n\n422\n00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.350\nYou have a visual Notification,\nnot just an auditory one and so\n\n423\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:01.210\nyou can specify that you've got\naudio settings for testing.\n\n424\n00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.300\nYou can make it where the screen\nflashes whenever there's an audio,\n\n425\n00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.800\nkinda prompt going on and\nit just goes back to the same thing.\n\n426\n00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.900\nIf you're deaf, the audio prompts don't\nhelp you, but if your screen flashes\n\n427\n00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:17.127\nto let you know, then you get that kind of\nwarning that gives you that hint, right?\n\n428\n00:21:17.127 --> 00:21:19.660\n[INAUDIBLE] virtual machine so\nthat one actually doesn't work, but\n\n429\n00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.960\nif I do it from my desktop, it would.\n\n430\n00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.880\nSome other things, like VoiceOver.\n\n431\n00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.510\nWith VoiceOver, it will start to\nread the text that's on your screen.\n\n432\n00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:33.135\nSo, if If you're blind, you can use\nscreen scraping software to be able to\n\n433\n00:21:33.135 --> 00:21:36.455\nread everything that is on there or\nVoiceOver can help with that.\n\n434\n00:21:36.455 --> 00:21:39.487\nAnd so, anytime you get to a screen,\nit'll just start to read that text.\n\n435\n00:21:39.487 --> 00:21:45.024\nSo, if I go back here to my System\nPreferences and [COUGH] once we're in\n\n436\n00:21:45.024 --> 00:21:50.565\nhere, it actually has a little\nshortcut which is Cmd+F5, there.\n\n437\n00:21:50.565 --> 00:21:54.397\nSo, I'm gonna turn it on and\nso it's on and is my system?\n\n438\n00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:56.777\n>> To control the computer\nusing only your keyboard.\n\n439\n00:21:56.777 --> 00:21:57.671\n>> I have my computer muted.\n\n440\n00:21:57.671 --> 00:22:01.260\n>> If you already know how to use\nVoiceOver, press the V key now.\n\n441\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.123\n>> There we go, so now that VoiceOver's on\n>> System preferences.\n\n442\n00:22:04.123 --> 00:22:04.924\nSystem preferences.\n\n443\n00:22:04.924 --> 00:22:05.737\nWindow, tool bar.\n\n444\n00:22:05.737 --> 00:22:06.782\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n445\n00:22:06.782

to.\n\n452\n00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.210\nSo if I don't necessarily have\nlike a visual impairment,\n\n453\n00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.250\nmaybe an auditory impairment,\nI can see it right there.\n\n454\n00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:33.000\nI currently have it selected on volume and\nas I move around,\n\n455\n00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.960\n>> System preferences,\n\n456\n00:22:33.960 -->

--> 00:22:39.293\n>> Let me turn that off, there we go.\n\n460\n00:22:39.293 --> 00:22:41.336\nIt's helping me by getting that, right?\n\n461\n00:22:41.336 --> 00:22:45.373\nSo the Accessibility features are really\nimportant, and I know some of you out\n\n462\n00:22:45.373 --> 00:22:50.330\nthere do have impairments or disabilities\nand this is extremely useful to you.\n\n463\n00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.270\nOthers they're usually the vast majority,\ndon't have disabilities.\n\n464\n00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:55.110\nI know what you're thinking.\n\n465\n00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.480\nI'm not gonna use this, what do I care?\n\n466\n00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:03.090\nWell, as a support professional,\nit may not be you that needs to use these.\n\n467\n00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.171\nIt may be your end users, right?\n\n468\n00:23:04.171 --> 00:23:07.853\nYou can really make a big difference in\nsomebody's life by making the computer\n\n469\n00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:11.055\neasier to use and by familiarizing\nyourself with these utilities.\n\n470\n00:23:11.055 --> 00:23:14.851\nWhile you, yourself may not need them,\nbut you can help other people that do.\n\n471\n00:23:14.851 --> 00:23:18.894\nAnd I can't stress how important it is\nthat you familiarize yourself with these\n\n472\n00:23:18.894 --> 00:23:23.137\nutilities, just know that they're out\nthere, that you may need to support them.\n\n473\n00:23:23.137 --> 00:23:24.688\nEven though you don't need them yourself,\nand\n\n474\n00:23:24.688 --> 00:23:27.259\nyou wanna make sure that you're ready for\nthat, so on the exam they do turn up.\n\n475\n00:23:27.259 --> 00:23:30.604\nAll right, so those four sections that\nwe just saw on System Preferences,\n\n476\n00:23:30.604 --> 00:23:33.112\nthose are the ones you're\nguaranteed to have, right?\n\n477\n00:23:33.112 --> 00:23:37.499\nSo it was personal, hardware,\nnetwork and Internet, and then system,\n\n478\n00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:40.280\nthose are the four that\nyou're going to have.\n\n479\n00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.820\nBut there's a fifth one that you may or\nmay not have and\n\n480\n00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.130\nthe fifth one is just called other.\n\n481\n00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:48.700\nIt's got a very creative name, so other.\n\n482\n00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:53.457\nIf I look at, sorry, I'm gonna give us all\nmotion sickness here, this is that stock\n\n483\n00:23:53.457 --> 00:23:57.287\ninstall I was messing with before\nthe show, or in the last episode.\n\n484\n00:23:57.287 --> 00:24:03.800\nAnd so I've got personal Hardware, network\nand internet, and system and that's it.\n\n485\n00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.179\nBut if you take a look at this one,\nthis other machine,\n\n486\n00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:10.940\nit's got a fifth section\ndown at the bottom.\n\n487\n00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.490\nOr my own laptop here, I've got this\nfifth section down here at the bottom.\n\n488\n00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:15.408\nWhat is that?\n\n489\n00:24:15.408 --> 00:24:18.897\nThat's other software I've been installed,\nnot from Apple, so\n\n490\n00:24:18.897 --> 00:24:22.200\nthird party software you might have,\nthings like Java.\n\n491\n00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.693\nJava creates a system preference.\n\n492\n00:24:23.693 --> 00:24:26.350\nYou might have liked this\nI've got SwitchResX for\n\n493\n00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:29.638\nchanging my screen resolution,\nI've got NTFS for Mac OS, so\n\n494\n00:24:29.638 --> 00:24:34.190\nthat I can read Windows formatted drives\nand write to them from inside of a Mac.\n\n495\n00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:38.324\nI got my Logitech control center for\nmanaging my wireless track ball.\n\n496\n00:24:38.324 --> 00:24:41.765\nAnd I've got GPGPreferences for\nmy GPG toolbox so that I can encrypt and\n\n497\n00:24:41.765 --> 00:24:44.470\ndecrypt secure emails or\nat least digitally sign them.\n\n498\n00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:49.319\nSo these are third party utilities I've\ninstalled that need a system preference.\n\n499\n00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:52.420\nAnd so they show up right\nhere in this last category.\n\n500\n00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.957\nIf you haven't installed any third party\nsoftware then you won't have anything\n\n501\n00:24:54.957 --> 00:24:56.272\nthere and that section doesn't show up.\n\n502\n00:24:56.272 --> 00:24:59.810\nBut that's the fifth section\nthat you may or may not have.\n\n503\n00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.811\nAll right, these system\npreferences are all important.\n\n504\n00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:04.453\nBecause when you get that new system and\n\n505\n00:25:04.453 --> 00:25:07.960\nyou start to customize it there's going\nto be things that you want to change.\n\n506\n00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.315\nSo for example,\none thing that I always change,\n\n507\n00:25:10.315 --> 00:25:12.565\nare the hard drives\nshowing up on the desktop?\n\n508\n00:25:12.565 --> 00:25:16.842\nBy default, when you install Mac OS, the\nhard drives don't show up on the desktop,\n\n509\n00:25:16.842 --> 00:25:18.470\nyou have to turn that on.\n\n510\n00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.890\nAnd so you can go into your finder\npreferences, or you can go into general\n\n511\n00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.759\nhere, and you've got a lot of options that\ncustomize what you see and what it looks\n\n512\n00:25:25.759 --> 00:25:29.041\nlike and what you want, they're all\njust kinda tucked away in here.\n\n513\n00:25:29.041 --> 00:25:32.262\nIf you browse around you'll see\nDesktop and Screen Saver, and\n\n514\n00:25:32.262 --> 00:25:36.272\nwe can change what our desktop wallpaper\nis, we can change our screen saver and\n\n515\n00:25:36.272 --> 00:25:38.060\nwhat it's gonna show up as.\n\n516\n00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.440\nYou can jump into Dock and\n\n517\n00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.338\nstart to customize the dock\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n518\n00:25:42.338 --> 00:25:45.305\nA lot of people like to make\nit automatically hide or\n\n519\n00:25:45.305 --> 00:25:49.583\nuse that zoom in effect on it so\nthat it'll show up, and kinda increase and\n\n520\n00:25:49.583 --> 00:25:53.690\ndecrease the size of the objects\nas you move your mouse over them.\n\n521\n00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.511\nThere's a lot of different things\nthat you can turn on, and tweak, and\n\n522\n00:25:56.511 --> 00:25:57.459\ncustomize this stuff.\n\n523\n00:25:57.459 --> 00:26:01.381\nAnd then, even in utilities like\nthe Finder, if I launch the Finder,\n\n524\n00:26:01.381 --> 00:26:05.038\nhere we go, and we go up to Finder and\nPreferences, you'll see in\n\n525\n00:26:05.038 --> 00:26:09.310\nthe finder preferences you can customize\nwhat items show up on the desktop.\n\n526\n00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.869\nSo, here is where I can\nturn on hard disks.\n\n527\n00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:13.840\nSo, I can start to see the hard\ndrives right here on my desktop.\n\n528\n00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.756\nSo, you can start to\ntweak those settings and\n\n529\n00:26:15.756 --> 00:26:17.780\nget them put them exactly\nthe way that you want.\n\n530\n00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.681\nThese are all preferences and settings\nthat you will want to customize on a Mac\n\n531\n00:26:21.681 --> 00:26:24.090\nto get it set to optimize\nyour user experience.\n\n532\n00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.192\nAll right, I do have one last thing that I\nwanna talk about before I wrap this turkey\n\n533\n00:26:30.192 --> 00:26:32.069\nup, and that's updates, okay.\n\n534\n00:26:32.069 --> 00:26:34.900\nYour Mac,\nit's gonna run great out of the box.\n\n535\n00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.341\nIt's designed to run great on your\nhardware, that's kinda a given.\n\n536\n00:26:37.341 --> 00:26:40.234\nBut over time Apple's gonna find bugs,\nthey're gonna find quirks,\n\n537\n00:26:40.234 --> 00:26:41.910\nand they're going to want to fix those.\n\n538\n00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.562\nAnd some of them are security fixes so\n\n539\n00:26:43.562 --> 00:26:46.187\nthey're really important to\nget out as fast as possible.\n\n540\n00:26:46.187 --> 00:26:49.900\nSo to do that we have to\nconfigure our system for updates.\n\n541\n00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.873\nAnd that's the last system preference\nthat I wanna show you guys.\n\n542\n00:26:51.873 --> 00:26:54.632\nI'm gonna go back into my\nsystem preferences and\n\n543\n00:26:54.632 --> 00:26:57.790\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go into App Store.\n\n544\n00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.448\nAnd I know that seems a little weird,\nI don't care about the App Store,\n\n545\n00:27:00.448 --> 00:27:02.014\nmaybe I don't even have any apps from it.\n\n546\n00:27:02.014 --> 00:27:05.920\nBut your Apple updates come\nfrom the app store now.\n\n547\n00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.660\nThat's something that changed back,\nI think it was 10.7 or\n\n548\n00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.160\n10.8 when they changed to this new model,\nbut it's been this way a while now,\n\n549\n00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.517\nand El Capitan,\nyour updates come from the app store.\n\n550\n00:27:14.517 --> 00:27:16.678\nSo when I go to the app\nstore system preference,\n\n551\n00:27:16.678 --> 00:27:19.700\nI'll see if it's set to\nautomatically check for updates.\n\n552\n00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.480\nIt's set to download new updates\nas soon as they become available.\n\n553\n00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.946\nSo as soon as an update is available,\nwe're going to start downloading it.\n\n554\n00:27:24.946 --> 00:27:27.741\nAnd then it's gonna install app updates,\nbut\n\n555\n00:27:27.741 --> 00:27:30.750\nit's not going to install OS 10 updates.\n\n556\n00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.987\nIt's going to prompt us and say hey,\ndo you want to do this update or not?\n\n557\n00:27:33.987 --> 00:27:36.890\nAnd we can say no, and not do the update.\n\n558\n00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.431\nWell, for you, as a support professional,\nthat's probably not a big deal, right?\n\n559\n00:27:40.431 --> 00:27:41.770\nYou can figure it out.\n\n560\n00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.608\nBut your end users, some end users will\nsay no and they won't do the update, and\n\n561\n00:27:45.608 --> 00:27:49.355\nnow they're missing critical security\nupdates, and so that's a problem.\n\n562\n00:27:49.355 --> 00:27:53.287\nSo Apple added this other option as\na default, install system data files and\n\n563\n00:27:53.287 --> 00:27:54.680\nsecurity updates.\n\n564\n00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.847\nSo if it's a security update,\nit's just gonna go ahead and do it.\n\n565\n00:27:56.847 --> 00:27:59.950\nSo yeah, they don't have to update\nOS 10 if they don't want to.\n\n566\n00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.755\nIf the next version comes out,\nthey don't have to bump to it, but\n\n567\n00:28:02.755 --> 00:28:04.288\nthey will apply security updates.\n\n568\n00:28:04.288 --> 00:28:08.910\nBut these can be turned on and off, and\nthat's not necessarily a good thing.\n\n569\n00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:12.263\nSo if you want to ensure these updates are\nhappening, you may wanna turn them all on\n\n570\n00:28:12.263 --> 00:28:15.468\nand prevent your users from turning them\noff, and the best way to do that is with\n\n571\n00:28:15.468 --> 00:28:18.647\na configuration profile, like I mentioned\nat the beginning of the episode.\n\n572\n00:28:18.647 --> 00:28:21.118\nWe can configure this, and\nthen they're locked down and\n\n573\n00:28:21.118 --> 00:28:23.390\nthe end users can't turn them off.\n\n574\n00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.090\nWe've gotta make sure\nthat we have that set up.\n\n575\n00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.572\nYou can have it show you the updates\nthat are currently available, and so\n\n576\n00:28:28.572 --> 00:28:31.939\nyou can check right now if I want, or\nI can just wait and it'll check and\n\n577\n00:28:31.939 --> 00:28:33.730\nget those updates on its own.\n\n578\n00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:35.640\nIt checks, I believe it's once a week, or\n\n579\n00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.879\nI think it's once every\nfour days that it checks.\n\n580\n00:28:37.879 --> 00:28:40.642\nIt doesn't check every single day, but\nit's gonna reach out and check, and\n\n581\n00:28:40.642 --> 00:28:43.200\nas soon as it gets those updates\nit's gonna pull them down.\n\n582\n00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.029\nIf I go to show updates,\nit's gonna launch the app store and\n\n583\n00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:49.990\nit's gonna take me into this updates tab,\nand I can see I've already got one update\n\n584\n00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:52.439\npending on the system and\nso I can see it right here.\n\n585\n00:28:52.439 --> 00:28:56.252\nAnd if I wait, eventually it's gonna\ninstall the update on its own,\n\n586\n00:28:56.252 --> 00:28:58.700\nright, or\nI can tell it to update right now.\n\n587\n00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.284\nSo, there's an update for\n10.11.4, I can update it all, and\n\n588\n00:29:02.284 --> 00:29:04.250\nit's going to download and restart.\n\n589\n00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:07.815\nIt's going to download that because\nI haven't told it to download it\n\n590\n00:29:07.815 --> 00:29:08.960\nahead of time.\n\n591\n00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.776\nAnd now it's going to download it,\nand when it's done, it will reboot and\n\n592\n00:29:11.776 --> 00:29:12.860\nstart to apply that update.\n\n593\n00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.980\nSo, definitely a critical piece.\n\n594\n00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.515\nYou absolutely want to\nconfigure updates on your Mac.\n\n595\n00:29:17.515 --> 00:29:20.904\n>> Great information and\nkeep in mind through this episode,\n\n596\n00:29:20.904 --> 00:29:25.550\nwe've been looking at a lot of the first\nsteps you will take post installation.\n\n597\n00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.550\nDon, got anything else there for us?\n\n598\n00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:30.530\n>> As far as your basics and\nwhat's on the exam, that's it.\n\n599\n00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.593\nNow, in real life,\nyou know there's a lot more.\n\n600\n00:29:32.593 --> 00:29:33.812\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n601\n00:29:33.812 --> 00:29:35.918\nNow, I've got to install\nmy applications and\n\n602\n00:29:35.918 --> 00:29:39.130\nall the applications have their\nown preferences and settings.\n\n603\n00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:41.817\nI might need to arrange my documents\nfolder the way that I like it.\n\n604\n00:29:41.817 --> 00:29:45.343\nI might need to install third party\nweb browsers, because Safari is not\n\n605\n00:29:45.343 --> 00:29:49.580\nnecessarily the greatest, so you have\na lot of things that you want to do.\n\n606\n00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.277\nYou'll want that to be\npart of your process.\n\n607\n00:29:51.277 --> 00:29:54.228\nOn the exam, they just want you to know\nthe stuff that's built into OS 10, and\n\n608\n00:29:54.228 --> 00:29:55.920\nthat's the stuff that we've covered here.\n\n609\n00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.795\n>> All right.\nThank you, Don.\n\n610\n00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:58.641\nAnd thank you guys out there watching us.\n\n611\n00:29:58.641 --> 00:30:00.998\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here on at IT Pro TV.\n\n612\n00:30:00.998 --> 00:30:02.519\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n613\n00:30:02.519 --> 00:30:03.413\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n614\n00:30:03.413 --> 00:30:05.422\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n615\n00:30:05.422 --> 00:30:13.040\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.813\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're gonna be continuing\n\n4\n00:00:18.813 --> 00:00:22.125\nalong with our Apple Certified\nSupport Professional certification.\n\n5\n00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.330\nAnd to join us today in the studio\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.620\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.490\n>> I am doing great, Wes,\nready to jump into the world of Apple.\n\n8\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.670\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\ntake a look at user accounts,\n\n9\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.020\nwhich on the Mac are actually\npretty interesting.\n\n10\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.272\nWhen you first install a Mac,\n\n11\n00:00:36.272 --> 00:00:39.289\nit asks you in the Setup Assistant\nwhat you want your user account to be.\n\n12\n00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.280\nSo you have at least one\nuser account on your system.\n\n13\n00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.650\nAnd you might not notice it very much\nbecause if you don't set a password,\n\n14\n00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.860\nthe system automatically logs in and\nyou never mess with it.\n\n15\n00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.223\nBut if you have more than one user\nthat's using this same computer,\n\n16\n00:00:52.223 --> 00:00:54.414\nyou're going to want to separate them out.\n\n17\n00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:57.385\nAnd there's even scenarios where if\nyou're the only person on the machine,\n\n18\n00:00:57.385 --> 00:01:00.690\nyou might still want alternate user\naccounts to use for different purposes.\n\n19\n00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.943\nSo in this episode we're gonna take\na look at the various different\n\n20\n00:01:03.943 --> 00:01:05.755\nuser account types that we've got.\n\n21\n00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:08.178\nAnd how we can control them,\nhow we can use them and\n\n22\n00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:09.981\nmake the most out of that sub system.\n\n23\n00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:11.177\nSo, let's just dive right in.\n\n24\n00:01:11.177 --> 00:01:14.390\nAnd the first thing I wanna do is just\ntalk about is where these user accounts\n\n25\n00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.006\nare, right?\n\n26\n00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:20.900\nSo here's a stock install of OS X,\nwe're running El Capitan 10.11.\n\n27\n00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.230\nAnd I just did the default install.\n\n28\n00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.180\nAnd when I ran the setup assistant,\nit created a user account for\n\n29\n00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.780\nme called Don Pezet.\n\n30\n00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.610\nNow when I go into my System Preferences,\n\n31\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.640\nI've got a system preference\ncalled Users & Groups.\n\n32\n00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.950\nAnd if we go into that, here's where\nyou'll see the one user account that it\n\n33\n00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.170\nmade, Don Pezet, all right.\n\n34\n00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.850\nNow that account is an Admin,\n\n35\n00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.480\nthe first user account you\ncreate as an administrator.\n\n36\n00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.555\nAnd an administrator can do whatever they\nwant on the computer, sort of, right?\n\n37\n00:01:49.555 --> 00:01:51.460\nThere's some limits that\nare applied to an admin.\n\n38\n00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.513\nSo I'm logged in as an admin, and\nlet's say I wanna add more users.\n\n39\n00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:57.669\nWell, if I wanna add more users,\nI gotta hit this plus button,\n\n40\n00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:59.735\nexcept I can't hit it, I'm clicking.\n\n41\n00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:03.900\nYou're an admin, and\nas an admin you can do anything.\n\n42\n00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.700\nWhich means,\nyou can cause a lot of problems.\n\n43\n00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.050\nI can run a program that has a virus\nin it and it can infect the system and\n\n44\n00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.820\nthen encrypt all my files.\n\n45\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.458\nI can do that, I'm an admin.\n\n46\n00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:17.804\nBut there's a little bit of a safety net\nin between you and the dangerous stuff.\n\n47\n00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:21.729\nSo, anytime you run something like\nan untrusted program from the Internet?\n\n48\n00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:25.350\nIt's gonna prompt you and say,\nare you sure you wanna do that, right?\n\n49\n00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.340\nOr here in my System Preferences,\nthe tools are all locked.\n\n50\n00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.280\nSee this little lock icon here?\n\n51\n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.040\nAnd only an administrator can unlock it.\n\n52\n00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.850\nI've got to type my password to do that.\n\n53\n00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.576\nSo an admin can do anything\nassuming they authenticate,\n\n54\n00:02:38.576 --> 00:02:41.820\nassuming they provide their username and\npassword to do it.\n\n55\n00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.720\nAnd that way, if I get up and walk away\nfrom this computer, and Wes sneaks over,\n\n56\n00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.660\nand says, I'm gonna get him.\n\n57\n00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.470\nHe could jump in there and\ntry and do something and\n\n58\n00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.630\nit would require that password again,\nand, he won't be able to do it, right?\n\n59\n00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.580\nBut once I've done that now,\n\n60\n00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.870\nI can come in and add more user\naccounts to my heart's content.\n\n61\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.890\nWhen I add a new user account, so\nI'll just hit the little plus sign there.\n\n62\n00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.820\nI can come in, and\nI can give the user account a name and\n\n63\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.190\nan account name and so on.\n\n64\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.840\nThose are standard settings.\n\n65\n00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.660\nBut the first decision we have\nto make is an important one,\n\n66\n00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.410\nand that's what kind of\naccount it's going to be.\n\n67\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.139\nAnd if I drop that down,\nthere's actually five choices,\n\n68\n00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.730\nfour of which are user accounts and\nthe fifth one is special.\n\n69\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.700\nThese choices are pretty important because\nyou don't have a good way to change it\n\n70\n00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.350\nafter the fact.\n\n71\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.060\nSome of them you can change,\nsome of them you can't.\n\n72\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.730\nI guess really, if I choose Group,\nit's not really a user account.\n\n73\n00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.600\nIt's a group, it's a collection of users.\n\n74\n00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.450\nAnd I can't change a group to a user and\nI can't change a user to a group.\n\n75\n00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.440\nThe first four though,\nactually kinda center around permissions.\n\n76\n00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.510\nAnd those I can change,\n\n77\n00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.700\nI can flip somebody from being\nan administrator to a standard user.\n\n78\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.970\nNow what's the difference?\n\n79\n00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.550\nWell an administrator and a standard\nuser can both log into the system.\n\n80\n00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.540\nThey both get a desktop, they both can\nrun programs and browse the Internet.\n\n81\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.560\nSo they're the same in that regard.\n\n82\n00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.770\nBut remember how I had to click the little\nlock to unlock the system preferences?\n\n83\n00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.120\nAn administrator can do that,\na standard user can't.\n\n84\n00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.680\nSo all those prompts that\nwe see as an administrator?\n\n85\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.250\nWe can clear those hurdles,\nstandard users can't.\n\n86\n00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.340\nThey've gotta get\nan administrator to help them.\n\n87\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.290\nSo they say,\nhey I wanna install this software,\n\n88\n00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.653\nlet me go get an administrator to help.\n\n89\n00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:13.970\nI wanna change a new user account,\nI've gotta get an administrator to help.\n\n90\n00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.180\nSo that's the difference.\n\n91\n00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.670\nIf you want somebody to be able to\nchange the computer, make them an admin.\n\n92\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.770\nIf you just want them to be able to use\nthe computer, make them a standard user.\n\n93\n00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.680\nAnd those are the two that we're\nnormally gonna choose between.\n\n94\n00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.490\nSo if I want Wes to be able to work on\nmy computer, I can come in here and\n\n95\n00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.640\nI can create a Wes Bryan account, right?\n\n96\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.940\nI can give it a full name, and when he\nlogs in, he can log in with a full name,\n\n97\n00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.060\nso, Wes Bryan.\n\n98\n00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.550\nOr he can log in with an account name.\n\n99\n00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.060\nNow remember that when we're\nin Mac OS it looks all pretty.\n\n100\n00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.140\nWe've got a graphical user interface,\nsuper easy to use.\n\n101\n00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.740\nBut in the background it's running BSD,\na Unix variant.\n\n102\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.870\nSo it's running the Unix Operating System,\nwhich is terribly complex.\n\n103\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.720\nAnd it's usually done\nwith command lines and\n\n104\n00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.170\na lot of crazy utilities in the background\nthat are very, very difficult to use.\n\n105\n00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.830\nWell, in Unix,\nyou have to have an account name.\n\n106\n00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.500\nAnd so that's what this next option is.\n\n107\n00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.490\nAnd we can use the account\nname if we want.\n\n108\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.320\nWes could log in with this account name,\nbut usually we don't see it.\n\n109\n00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.250\nUsually it's just kinda one of\nthose invisible things to us\n\n110\n00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.140\nwe don't care about.\n\n111\n00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.420\nThe only time we see it,\nis when we're browsing to our home folder.\n\n112\n00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.370\nBecause this account name\nis what's gonna be used for\n\n113\n00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.140\nour home folder not the full name.\n\n114\n00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.370\nSo pick a name that makes sense.\n\n115\n00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.780\nYou can't have two user accounts\nwith the same account name.\n\n116\n00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.074\nBut it's gonna give you something\ndifferent by default anyway, and\n\n117\n00:05:26.074 --> 00:05:28.021\nthat's just gonna be that folder name.\n\n118\n00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:31.701\nNow these, you can change\nthe full name after the fact,\n\n119\n00:05:31.701 --> 00:05:34.750\nchanging the account\nname can be done also.\n\n120\n00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.080\nBut it's kind of hard because the folder\nname for your profile has all ready\n\n121\n00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.840\nbeen set to one thing, and\nit's not gonna change that folder name.\n\n122\n00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.860\nSo you wanna try and get this right\nfrom the beginning, don't make a typo or\n\n123\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.819\nwhatever, get that correct.\n\n124\n00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.500\nThen as far as the password is concerned,\ndo I want him to use an iCloud account or\n\n125\n00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.010\na separate password, right?\n\n126\n00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.070\nIf I say separate password,\n\n127\n00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.630\nthis is gonna be a user account that\nexists right here on this machine.\n\n128\n00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.040\nHe can always switch to\niCloud later if he wants to.\n\n129\n00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.740\nI'll just use it right\nhere on this machine, and\n\n130\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.940\nI'll set him a password, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.230\nOnce that's done, I've now got\na standard user created for him.\n\n132\n00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.310\nAnd there we go,\nhe'll show up in the list.\n\n133\n00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.100\nI've got Wes Bryan, standard user.\n\n134\n00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.710\nSo the current user, that's me,\nwho I'm logged in as, and\n\n135\n00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.730\nthen Other Users is the other\naccounts I have in my system.\n\n136\n00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.560\nThere's Wes, standard user.\n\n137\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.790\nAnd if I choose Wes, right over here\nI see where I can reset his password.\n\n138\n00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.490\nI can allow user to\nadminister this computer, so\n\n139\n00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.010\nI can change him from a standard\nuser to an administrator.\n\n140\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.821\nI can undo that choice\nthat I made a minute ago.\n\n141\n00:06:32.821 --> 00:06:35.350\nAnd I can enable parental controls.\n\n142\n00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.200\nNow parental controls, I didn't see\nthat when I was adding a user, right?\n\n143\n00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.637\nWhen I added the user, if I drop it down,\nit's Managed with Parental Controls.\n\n144\n00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:46.039\nSo I can make him into a Managed\nwith Parental Controls.\n\n145\n00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.141\nThe only one I can't do is\nchoose is the Sharing Only,\n\n146\n00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:49.560\nI'll explain that one in a minute.\n\n147\n00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.960\nNow Managed with Parental Controls,\nthis is a special account.\n\n148\n00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.336\nThis is a standard user, so\njust like Wes, is a standard user,\n\n149\n00:06:56.336 --> 00:06:58.398\nbut with parental controls enabled.\n\n150\n00:06:58.398 --> 00:07:02.300\nSo you can restrict what websites\nthey can get to and other things.\n\n151\n00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.500\nYou can really limit what there access is.\n\n152\n00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.825\nSo maybe I wanna make this,\nit's a kid, right?\n\n153\n00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:09.050\nSo I'll say, age nine and up.\n\n154\n00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.940\nWe'll do one of the other hosts,\nwe'll do Daniel Lowrie.\n\n155\n00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.940\nSo we're are gonna set Daniel up as a kid.\n\n156\n00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.572\nI don't want him getting out\nthere on the Internet and\n\n157\n00:07:15.572 --> 00:07:18.040\nbrowsing the sites that he shouldn't,\ncuz he's a bad guy.\n\n158\n00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.944\nSo we'll get through and punch in that\nuser account, we'll give him a password,\n\n159\n00:07:21.944 --> 00:07:23.030\nand so on.\n\n160\n00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.090\nEverything here is set up\njust like a standard user,\n\n161\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.280\nbecause he is a standard user.\n\n162\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.880\nThe only difference is picking this\nage limit, and I'm setting him for\n\n163\n00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.300\nthe nine and up age limit, right?\n\n164\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.850\nWhen I create that user,\nhe's gonna show up over here.\n\n165\n00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.020\nThere he is.\n\n166\n00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.076\nAnd for a brief moment, you might have saw\nit, where it said Daniel Lowrie, Standard.\n\n167\n00:07:42.076 --> 00:07:46.103\nIt created a Standard user, and\nthen it switched to Managed.\n\n168\n00:07:46.103 --> 00:07:49.078\nAnd that managed part is what lets\nme know he has parental controls on.\n\n169\n00:07:49.078 --> 00:07:52.200\nAnd if I look over here,\nthe only difference between him and\n\n170\n00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.203\nWes is that he's got that checkmark for\nEnable parental controls, right?\n\n171\n00:07:56.203 --> 00:07:57.631\nIf I go to Wes, he doesn't.\n\n172\n00:07:57.631 --> 00:08:00.612\nIf I turn them on,\nsee how Wes just changed to Managed?\n\n173\n00:08:00.612 --> 00:08:01.773\nAnd I can turn it off.\n\n174\n00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:05.320\nOr if I choose allow administer,\nsee how he just changed to admin, right?\n\n175\n00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.620\nAnd then I can turn that off.\n\n176\n00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.660\nSo you can flip back and\nforth between these three roles,\n\n177\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.260\nbetween standard, admin,\nand managed pretty easy.\n\n178\n00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.480\nAnd why is it not letting\nme turn that off?\n\n179\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.030\nThere we go, all right.\n\n180\n00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.358\nNow, one thing about parental control\nis you don't wanna just turn them on.\n\n181\n00:08:20.358 --> 00:08:22.970\nYou've also gotta get in there and\nkind of customize what those controls are.\n\n182\n00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.860\nAnd so you'll see enable parental controls\nwith the Open Parental Controls button.\n\n183\n00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.780\nIt's just gonna take you to the system\npreference for parental controls,\n\n184\n00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.170\nyou could go directly to it.\n\n185\n00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.180\nWhen we jump into that, you have to be\nan administrator to adjust the settings.\n\n186\n00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.450\nSo I've gotta kind of clear\nmy permissions there.\n\n187\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.460\nAnd now I'm gonna see\na list of user accounts.\n\n188\n00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.540\nNow Daniel, he has parental controls,\nWes doesn't, right?\n\n189\n00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.450\nSo if I click on Wes, it tells me\nparental controls are turned off for\n\n190\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.600\nthe account, and\nI can enable them if I want.\n\n191\n00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.660\nNotice that I don't show up in the list.\n\n192\n00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.350\nAnd that's because you can't turn parental\ncontrols on for an administrator.\n\n193\n00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:57.870\nAn administrator can just go and\nturn them off again, so\n\n194\n00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.670\nthere's no point in doing it.\n\n195\n00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.160\nYou're just gonna see your standard users.\n\n196\n00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.920\nBut when I choose Daniel,\nright over here, I can pick and\n\n197\n00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.930\nchoose from all the things that\nI want him to have access to.\n\n198\n00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.480\nIs he allowed to use the camera?\n\n199\n00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.508\nWell, if he's a nine year old,\nprobably not.\n\n200\n00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:11.762\nI don't want that camera turning on.\n\n201\n00:09:11.762 --> 00:09:12.800\nSo I'm gonna turn that off.\n\n202\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.790\nI don't want him to do that.\n\n203\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.860\nMaybe I don't want Game Center,\nor maybe I do, I don't know.\n\n204\n00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.180\nWe can start to restrict what\napplications he's allowed to run.\n\n205\n00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.908\nRight, I don't want him to just\nrun everything on the computer,\n\n206\n00:09:21.908 --> 00:09:23.939\nI wanna hold him down to\njust a few things, like,\n\n207\n00:09:23.939 --> 00:09:26.190\nI don't want him to be able\nto launch Safari, right.\n\n208\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.994\nNo unauthorized or\nunsupervised web access for him,\n\n209\n00:09:29.994 --> 00:09:32.740\nthat he can run this educational program,\nand that's it.\n\n210\n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.070\nYou start to pick and\nchoose what they're allowed to run.\n\n211\n00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.930\nOther things you can do,\nyou can control their web access.\n\n212\n00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.180\nYou can actually restrict them to just\na few specific websites if you want.\n\n213\n00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.420\nYou can define whether they're\nallowed to get to the app store, and\n\n214\n00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.590\nif they can get to the app store,\nwhat are they allowed to get, right?\n\n215\n00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.170\nMovies up to a certain rating,\nTV shows up to a certain rating,\n\n216\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.100\napps that are rated to a certain level.\n\n217\n00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.720\nYou can specify time restrictions,\n\n218\n00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.010\nI don't want them jumping in and\nusing the computer 20 hours a day.\n\n219\n00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.100\nI can set a 4 hour quota and\n\n220\n00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.360\nsay once you have 4 hours,\nyou can't use the system anymore.\n\n221\n00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.010\nSo these are all different things we can\nconfigure as part of parental controls,\n\n222\n00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.250\nand that's what makes those\nuser accounts special.\n\n223\n00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.170\nSo a managed user is just a standard\nuser with parental controls turned on,\n\n224\n00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.070\nall right?\n\n225\n00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.440\nSo, those are the first three,\n\n226\n00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.490\nright, admin, standard user,\nmanaged with parental controls.\n\n227\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.490\nThe fourth type of user was special,\nand it was shared only, right?\n\n228\n00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:33.190\nWhen I went to add a user account,\nI had that sharing only option.\n\n229\n00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.330\nWell everything after that really\nlooks like a standard user.\n\n230\n00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.220\nSo maybe one of our other\nhosts like Ronnie Wong, so\n\n231\n00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.200\nI want Ronnie to be able\nto use this system.\n\n232\n00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.630\nAnd so I can create an account for him and\n\n233\n00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.160\nI'm gonna set him as sharing only,\nall right?\n\n234\n00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.730\nWell, what a sharing only account is\n\n235\n00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.750\nis it's actually very similar\nto a standard account.\n\n236\n00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.450\nSo there he is, but\nnotice how I can't make him an admin.\n\n237\n00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.770\nI can't turn on parental controls.\n\n238\n00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.095\nThe reason is I just created\nan account for Ronnie.\n\n239\n00:11:00.095 --> 00:11:03.380\nRonnie's actually not allowed\nto log in to this computer.\n\n240\n00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:08.010\nHe can't sit down and log in on\nthe computer, because he's sharing only.\n\n241\n00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.750\nA sharing only account can only access\nyour computer over the network.\n\n242\n00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.890\nIf I share out a folder on my system,\n\n243\n00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.970\nand I want Ronnie to be able to access it,\nI don't want him to log in to my laptop.\n\n244\n00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.980\nI just want him to be able to browse\nover the network to get at my folder.\n\n245\n00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.890\nAnd so I can create a sharing\nonly account for him.\n\n246\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.160\nAnd then let's say here,\n\n247\n00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.760\nI'll just make a folder on my\ndesktop that I'll call Ronnie.\n\n248\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.230\nAnd so this is stuff that I wanna share\nwith Ronnie, and in my System Preferences,\n\n249\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.200\nI can go to Sharing, and\nI can go to File Sharing.\n\n250\n00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.860\nAnd I'm gonna add in that folder\nthat I just made for Ronnie, right?\n\n251\n00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.640\nSo I'm adding that to my sharing list.\n\n252\n00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.920\nAnd then over here, I'm gonna come in and\n\n253\n00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.750\nadd Ronnie to the list of people that\nare allowed to access that folder.\n\n254\n00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.970\nAnd I'm gonna give Ronnie full control,\nread and write access.\n\n255\n00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.690\nAnd I'm gonna take everybody else and\ngive them no access.\n\n256\n00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.590\nI'm just gonna take them out, so\n\n257\n00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:07.330\nthat it's just Ronnie and I, and\nthen everyone else gets no access, right?\n\n258\n00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.663\nSo, by doing that,\nnow Ronnie can be on his laptop.\n\n259\n00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:13.789\nHe can browse the network and\nhe'll see this Ronnie folder,\n\n260\n00:12:13.789 --> 00:12:17.000\nhe can log in with the account\nthat I created for him.\n\n261\n00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.760\nThat's this account right here, the\nsharing only kind, he can log in with that\n\n262\n00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.280\naccount, provide the username and\npassword, and he can access that folder.\n\n263\n00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.160\nBut if he sits down at my laptop,\nhe can't log in.\n\n264\n00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.780\nIt's not a valid account for that.\n\n265\n00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:32.700\nIf I log out, well here, let me just,\nI'll go to log in window.\n\n266\n00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.190\nIf I log out,\nhe's not gonna show up in the list.\n\n267\n00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.670\nSo I see Daniel Lowrie, I see Don Pezet,\n\n268\n00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:44.000\nI see Wes Bryan, I don't see Ronnie,\nhe's sharing only, all right.\n\n269\n00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.540\nSo I can switch back and\nforth between admin,\n\n270\n00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.660\nstandard user, managed user,\nthat's easy to flip between.\n\n271\n00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.205\nI can't move between those user\naccounts and a sharing only.\n\n272\n00:12:56.205 --> 00:13:00.350\nCuz a sharing only account doesn't have a\nuser profile, it doesn't have a folder for\n\n273\n00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.620\nthat, it doesn't have desktop settings,\nit doesn't have any of that.\n\n274\n00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.250\nIt's not the same, all right.\n\n275\n00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.700\nNow the last one that we saw when\nI go to add a user is a group.\n\n276\n00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.140\nAnd if I choose group,\nthat's not a user account at all.\n\n277\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.220\nIt's a collection of user accounts, and\n\n278\n00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.620\nso I might wanna create a group\ncalled Show Hosts, all right?\n\n279\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.794\nAnd so\nthis will be Show Hosts here on itpro.tv.\n\n280\n00:13:19.794 --> 00:13:23.330\nAnd so I'll create that group,\nand now I can put people in it.\n\n281\n00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:28.190\nAnd see how I can add admins,\nstandard users, managed users, and\n\n282\n00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.180\nsharing only in that group?\n\n283\n00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.740\nI can mix and\nmatch however I want inside of that group.\n\n284\n00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.032\nAnd that's useful because now I\nmight have another folder, so\n\n285\n00:13:37.032 --> 00:13:40.460\nlet me make a new folder here\nthat I'll call Show Notes.\n\n286\n00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.160\nSo, here's notes for the show that I want\nto be available all the show hosts, and so\n\n287\n00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.195\nwhen I go to share that out on my network,\n\n288\n00:13:46.195 --> 00:13:50.140\nI can go into sharing,\nI can add that folder.\n\n289\n00:13:51.636 --> 00:13:54.970\nAnd so I'll go and find that\nShow Notes folder, I'll add that in,\n\n290\n00:13:54.970 --> 00:14:00.070\nand now when I go to set it up, I can say,\nyou know what, everyone gets no access.\n\n291\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.970\nStaff, I'll take Staff out,\nStaff are just the users on my computer.\n\n292\n00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.680\nAnd, shoot, I'm messing with the wrong\nfolders, sorry Wes, I broke your folder.\n\n293\n00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.520\nLet me go to the right folder.\n\n294\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:15.220\nI'll go to Show Notes and I'm gonna add\nin the Show Hosts group, all right?\n\n295\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.320\nAnd I'm gonna give Show Hosts\nfull control of that folder.\n\n296\n00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.620\nI've got full control,\nI'll take Staff out, and\n\n297\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.870\nI'll switch Everyone to No Access.\n\n298\n00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.800\nSo now only people in that Show Hosts\ngroup will have access to it.\n\n299\n00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.882\nSo Ronnie will, and Mike, well, not Mike,\nI didn't include an account for Mike, but\n\n300\n00:14:31.882 --> 00:14:33.039\nRonnie, Wes, Daniel,\n\n301\n00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:36.740\nthey'll all have access to that\ndata because they're in that group.\n\n302\n00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.700\nGroups are just helpful for\nassigning permissions.\n\n303\n00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.790\nOutside of that,\ngroups are really not useful at all.\n\n304\n00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.280\nThey're just for\nassigning permissions, and\n\n305\n00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.720\nthat makes it just kind\nof easier to manage that.\n\n306\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.300\n>> And with the groups there, Don,\ndoes that mean once you change one of\n\n307\n00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.250\nthe permissions, does it propagate\nto everybody that's in that group?\n\n308\n00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.540\nAnd if that's so, could I add\nsomebody later to that group and\n\n309\n00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.120\njust make it even easier?\n\n310\n00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.790\n>> Yeah, that's the big benefit, right?\n\n311\n00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.181\nSo once I get all these permissions set,\nI don't wanna go back and\n\n312\n00:15:01.181 --> 00:15:02.714\nupdate this over and over and over again.\n\n313\n00:15:02.714 --> 00:15:06.780\nSo let's say that we bring on another\nhost or I mentioned, I forgot Mike.\n\n314\n00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.710\nSo let's create Mike an account, right.\n\n315\n00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:11.247\nSo I'm gonna create an account for Mike,\nand unlike you guys, I trust him so\n\n316\n00:15:11.247 --> 00:15:12.850\nI'll make him an admin.\n\n317\n00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:18.150\nSo I'm gonna add Mike Roderick here,\nand so as I add Mike,\n\n318\n00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.520\nI'm gonna create his account,\nI'm gonna give him a password, right?\n\n319\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:27.221\nSo this is all just his user account,\nand so I'll go in and create that user.\n\n320\n00:15:27.221 --> 00:15:31.014\nSo now I've got a Mike Roderick account,\nwhich is right here,\n\n321\n00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:35.610\nhe showed up as an admin, and I can go to\nmy Show Host group and I can add him in.\n\n322\n00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:40.230\nAnd when I add him in, he now gets all\nthe access that that group entails, so\n\n323\n00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.030\nhe now has access to\nthat Show Notes folder.\n\n324\n00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.470\nOr I might have assigned\npermissions to a printer,\n\n325\n00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.630\nother folders, a login on my\nOpen Directory server, all sorts of stuff.\n\n326\n00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.990\nHe would now get that access\nbecause he's in that group.\n\n327\n00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.520\nAnd if we fire somebody,\nso Wes, you're out.\n\n328\n00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.593\nI just take him out of the group.\n\n329\n00:15:55.593 --> 00:15:57.273\nAnd as soon as I take\nWes out of the group,\n\n330\n00:15:57.273 --> 00:16:00.500\nhe can't get to the Show Notes folder\nanymore, he just lost that privilege.\n\n331\n00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.436\nCuz he got it from being\na part of the group.\n\n332\n00:16:03.436 --> 00:16:05.260\nSo, that's how those groups are used.\n\n333\n00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.490\nIt's just for managerial convenience.\n\n334\n00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:11.280\nIf you've only got one user account and\nthat is it, you're not gonna use groups.\n\n335\n00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.420\nIf you've got many people\nsharing the machine,\n\n336\n00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.770\nyou can use groups to dull out\nthose permissions a little better.\n\n337\n00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.150\nAnd the other thing is,\nif you have an open directory.\n\n338\n00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.940\nYour groups might not be\nhere on your own computer.\n\n339\n00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.420\nThe groups might be in\nthe open directory instead.\n\n340\n00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.705\nAnd we'll talk about that\nmore in the ACTC shows.\n\n341\n00:16:26.705 --> 00:16:29.960\nAll right, so those are the five different\ntypes of accounts that we can create here.\n\n342\n00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.880\nWhen you create an account, every account\nhas what is called an account attribute.\n\n343\n00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.840\nWhen you go and look at the accounts your\ngonna see a number of different settings.\n\n344\n00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.690\nThese settings are called attributes,\nso things tied to the user.\n\n345\n00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.910\nAnd at a minimum, you're gonna have\na full name, and an account name.\n\n346\n00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.437\nSo my full name is Don Pezet,\n\n347\n00:16:47.437 --> 00:16:50.821\nmy account name was Don Pezet\nall lowercase written together.\n\n348\n00:16:50.821 --> 00:16:55.019\nWell, those options, you don't\nnecessarily see by default, right?\n\n349\n00:16:55.019 --> 00:16:58.060\nI don't see where I can\nchange that name or anything.\n\n350\n00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:02.043\nBut if I right click on the user,\nor Control click, or\n\n351\n00:17:02.043 --> 00:17:04.353\nuse a little gear some of them.\n\n352\n00:17:04.353 --> 00:17:07.127\nThen we can get on the advance options for\na user and\n\n353\n00:17:07.127 --> 00:17:09.978\nyou'll see where you can\ntweak all sorts of stuff.\n\n354\n00:17:09.978 --> 00:17:12.930\nThen you've gotta be careful here,\ncuz you can break the user account.\n\n355\n00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.402\nBut this is where I can see the Full name,\nand the Account name, and\n\n356\n00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:20.447\nthe Home directory and so I can change\nthose, but the changed individually.\n\n357\n00:17:20.447 --> 00:17:24.028\nIf I change my Account name to\nbe Don Pezet instead of dpezet,\n\n358\n00:17:24.028 --> 00:17:26.850\nthe Home directory\ndoesn't change by itself.\n\n359\n00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:30.480\nI've got to come in and change it and\ndoes my data move along with it?\n\n360\n00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.550\nNot necessarily,\nI might have to move the data myself.\n\n361\n00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:36.150\nSo, I do need to be aware that\nthe advanced settings are there.\n\n362\n00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.070\nThey're just hidden because they're\ndangerous, you can break the user.\n\n363\n00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.660\n>> All right, I also see Don, up there,\n\n364\n00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:46.330\nthat crazy long string of characters\nthere that UUID, I believe there.\n\n365\n00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.400\nNow what about that?\n\n366\n00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.390\nIs that the way the system sees this?\n\n367\n00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:53.680\n>> Yeah, if you change the name of the\nuser account, it's got a different name.\n\n368\n00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.817\nIt's an all new person, right?\n\n369\n00:17:54.817 --> 00:17:57.842\nWell, not really, it's still\nthe same person under the hood and\n\n370\n00:17:57.842 --> 00:18:00.707\nthe way your Mac tells that is\nbased on these user IDs, right?\n\n371\n00:18:00.707 --> 00:18:05.252\nSo this is a universally unique ID or\nidentifier and it's identifying\n\n372\n00:18:05.252 --> 00:18:10.270\nmy user account, so that if I change\nthe name my UUID stays the same.\n\n373\n00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:11.580\nAnd so when I go to access files and\n\n374\n00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.350\nfolders, the Mac doesn't really\ncare what my name is at all.\n\n375\n00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:18.120\nIt knows who I am based on this\nuniversally unique ID and so, it's gonna\n\n376\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.820\nmake sure that I'm able to have that\naccess, that's why we can change the name.\n\n377\n00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:26.420\nIt's really useful because you might\nhave something like, let's say,\n\n378\n00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:31.080\nyou have a woman in your company who gets\nmarried and changes her last name, right?\n\n379\n00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.820\nOr somebody wants to add\na hyphenated name or\n\n380\n00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.480\nsomething like that, you can just come\nin and modify their name right here.\n\n381\n00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.790\nThey still have all the same permissions.\n\n382\n00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:38.507\nThey're in all the same groups.\n\n383\n00:18:38.507 --> 00:18:40.132\nThey have all the same access.\n\n384\n00:18:40.132 --> 00:18:41.630\nIt's just their account\nhas a different name.\n\n385\n00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.220\nThat's it, it's really no big deal.\n\n386\n00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.248\nSo, these numbers they're kinda\nsimilar to a Social Security Number.\n\n387\n00:18:47.248 --> 00:18:50.315\nHere in the United States, everybody\nhas a Social Security Number, and\n\n388\n00:18:50.315 --> 00:18:52.886\nthat number identifies you as a citizen,\nor whatever it is.\n\n389\n00:18:52.886 --> 00:18:54.590\nThat's is kinda what this is doing.\n\n390\n00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:55.744\nIt's just a big long number,\n\n391\n00:18:55.744 --> 00:18:58.801\nbecause Apple wants to make sure they\ndon't accidentally duplicate people.\n\n392\n00:18:58.801 --> 00:19:00.673\nAs you create new people,\n\n393\n00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:05.361\nit's astronomical odds that you\nhave two people get the same ID.\n\n394\n00:19:05.361 --> 00:19:07.980\nAll right, so that's all kinda\nhidden away in the background.\n\n395\n00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.740\nWe don't normally have to deal with that,\nfortunately,\n\n396\n00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.270\nbut those attributes are there.\n\n397\n00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.390\nThe one we have to deal with\nthe most is the password and\n\n398\n00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:14.660\nso you'll see that option right here.\n\n399\n00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.020\nUnder my account, I can change\nthe password then I can reset to whatever.\n\n400\n00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.710\nI can do that for the other users to,\nso, if one of these guys forgets their\n\n401\n00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:24.620\npassword, I can just take them reset\ntheir password and we're done.\n\n402\n00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.620\nSo, those are all kind of in there.\n\n403\n00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.374\nOther attributes that you might\nhave things like being linked\n\n404\n00:19:30.374 --> 00:19:32.111\nto iCloud account, right?\n\n405\n00:19:32.111 --> 00:19:35.395\nWhen I created these users, I didn't\npick to link them to an iCloud account,\n\n406\n00:19:35.395 --> 00:19:37.190\nnot a single one of them, right?\n\n407\n00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.670\nWhen we got to reset the password,\nthis is the local password now.\n\n408\n00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:45.330\nSo if I change my mind, they can log in\nand they can bind it to an iCloud account.\n\n409\n00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.720\nAll they have to do is go into the System\nPreferences, once they've log in and\n\n410\n00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.600\ngo to the iCloud system preference.\n\n411\n00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.842\nAnd that'll give them\na chance to log in and\n\n412\n00:19:52.842 --> 00:19:55.909\nconvert there's over\nauthenticating that way, right?\n\n413\n00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:58.486\nAs an administrator, the only way\nthat I can really do it for them,\n\n414\n00:19:58.486 --> 00:20:01.292\nif I wanna force it, is actually a little\nhard because what you can do is,\n\n415\n00:20:01.292 --> 00:20:03.280\nI can take somebody like Wes here.\n\n416\n00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.670\nI can go into his Advanced Options and\n\n417\n00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:10.310\ndown here at the bottom it's got\nApple ID and I can hit the Set button.\n\n418\n00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.710\nSo I can set an Apple ID for him and\nhere it is, it's gonna ask for it and\n\n419\n00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.880\nI can put in whatever his Apple ID is.\n\n420\n00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.320\nSo, wes@mydomain.com or\nwhatever it is that he's got and\n\n421\n00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.150\nthen, get that assigned or\neven create the Apple ID for them.\n\n422\n00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.196\nIf you work in a school and you're trying\nto create accounts for your students,\n\n423\n00:20:29.196 --> 00:20:31.845\nyou may need your students to have\nan Apple ID, even to get free apps.\n\n424\n00:20:31.845 --> 00:20:34.527\nAnd so you might wanna create\nthat ahead of time for them and\n\n425\n00:20:34.527 --> 00:20:37.447\nyou can do it right there, so\nthat is a kind of important thing.\n\n426\n00:20:37.447 --> 00:20:40.330\n>> Don, when it comes to\nlinking to the iCloud account,\n\n427\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.750\nwhat would be one benefit of that over\nmaybe saying using a local password?\n\n428\n00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.780\n>> There's a bunch of benefits to it.\n\n429\n00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.551\nPassword recovery, if you forget\nyour password on you're own Mac,\n\n430\n00:20:49.551 --> 00:20:52.581\nyou normally have to go and get the\nadministrator to go and reset it for you.\n\n431\n00:20:52.581 --> 00:20:55.242\nBut if you're using an iCloud account,\nyou go to Apple's website and\n\n432\n00:20:55.242 --> 00:20:56.380\ngo into the Apple ID section.\n\n433\n00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.332\nYou can reset your password using\nyour email address and all that, and\n\n434\n00:20:59.332 --> 00:21:02.535\nthen you can reset it yourself without\nhaving to get the admins involved, so\n\n435\n00:21:02.535 --> 00:21:03.560\nthat's one use.\n\n436\n00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.710\nThey also have things like\nmulti-factor authentication now,\n\n437\n00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.510\nwhere when you go to log in, you log\nin with a username and password and\n\n438\n00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.510\nthen it sends a code to your cell\nphone and you type in the code.\n\n439\n00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:17.550\nSo, an extra factor to authenticate\nwith and it's also like Single Sign-On.\n\n440\n00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.500\nSo, for example, where I've got\nmy laptop and I've got an iMac,\n\n441\n00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.760\nand I wanna go back and forth between\nthem, it's two separate accounts.\n\n442\n00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.410\nIf I change my password on one,\nI've gotta change it on the other.\n\n443\n00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.950\nBut if I'm logging in with iCloud,\nI change the password on one,\n\n444\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.210\nand it's already changed on the other, so\n\n445\n00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.710\nI always log in with the same username and\npassword.\n\n446\n00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.224\nThose are some of the different\nbenefits of doing it.\n\n447\n00:21:36.224 --> 00:21:38.198\nAll right, so\nthose are some of the different accounts.\n\n448\n00:21:38.198 --> 00:21:42.559\nNow some of you might have noticed if\nyou're eagle-eyed here and watching,\n\n449\n00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:45.550\nthat I said I have one account, Don Pezet.\n\n450\n00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:50.980\nBut there was another account in the list,\nthis guy right here, Guest User, okay?\n\n451\n00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:55.520\nI didn't create Guest User, it was there\nalready, and the Guest User is off, okay?\n\n452\n00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.610\nSo what is this Guest User?\n\n453\n00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:02.810\nThe Guest User allows somebody login to\nyour Mac without a username and password.\n\n454\n00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:04.650\nNow, why the heck would I want that?\n\n455\n00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.840\nThat sounds like a terrible idea and\nI'm sure that's what it is,\n\n456\n00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:07.525\nit's a terrible idea.\n\n457\n00:22:07.525 --> 00:22:09.770\nThat' why it's off by default, all right.\n\n458\n00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:12.330\nBut if you gonna get a key ask machine or\nyou want students to come and\n\n459\n00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.820\nuse it and you still wanna mess with user\nnames and passwords, you can turn that on.\n\n460\n00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.570\nThe cool thing about the guest users,\nthey log in and they can use the system.\n\n461\n00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:22.640\nThey can't get in to your data, your\ndata is protected with permissions but\n\n462\n00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.590\nthey can use the system,\nthey can browse the Internet.\n\n463\n00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.540\nDo whatever they want and\nwhen they log in,\n\n464\n00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.950\nall the stuff they did gets thrown away.\n\n465\n00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.200\nSo, if you have a lab computer for\nstudents,\n\n466\n00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.180\nthey can log in without a password, use\nthe computer, and when it's done they're\n\n467\n00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.630\nsettings get thrown away and trashed and\nit's all back to the way that it was.\n\n468\n00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.667\nSo that's kinda nice, you can even\nenable parental controls on it and\n\n469\n00:22:40.667 --> 00:22:42.789\ncontrol whether they can\nget to shared folders.\n\n470\n00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:44.462\nYou've got those options, all right?\n\n471\n00:22:44.462 --> 00:22:49.360\nSo it's really a pretty restricted\naccount, but it is turned off by default.\n\n472\n00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.860\nYou can choose to turn it on, by allowing\nguests to login to this computer.\n\n473\n00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.050\nI will tell you there's one scenario\nwhere this gets turned on, okay?\n\n474\n00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.991\nI tell you, hey it's a bad thing,\nyou really don't want that turned on.\n\n475\n00:22:58.991 --> 00:23:02.722\nBut, take a look at my computer,\nso this is my own laptop.\n\n476\n00:23:02.722 --> 00:23:07.080\nAnd if I go into my System Preferences,\nand I come in here and I look.\n\n477\n00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.350\nActually my Guest User is off.\n\n478\n00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.200\nShoot, I thought mine was on.\n\n479\n00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.340\nThere's one scenario where it gets turned\non, and I thought mine was done that way.\n\n480\n00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:17.550\nThere's a feature called Find My Mac.\n\n481\n00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.990\nIf you lose your Mac and\nyou wanna find it,\n\n482\n00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.900\nyou can go long into the iCloud website\nand use the Find My Mac feature, and\n\n483\n00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.030\nit'll tell you where you left your laptop.\n\n484\n00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.100\nIt'll tell you the last place where\nit checked in, so you can go and\n\n485\n00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.580\nfind it, okay?\n\n486\n00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:37.400\nWell, if somebody steals my laptop and the\nlaptop's turned off, am I gonna find it?\n\n487\n00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.580\nNo, it's turned off.\n\n488\n00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.440\nThey took it somewhere, I'm not\ngetting a signal, it's powered off.\n\n489\n00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.520\nSo when you turn on Find My Mac,\nApple turns on the Guest User account.\n\n490\n00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.720\nAnd the reason they do it, is the theory\nis whoever stole your laptop is gonna fire\n\n491\n00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.510\nit up and they're gonna try and\nlog in as you.\n\n492\n00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:54.130\nBut you've got a password, right?\n\n493\n00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.430\nSo they can't log in.\n\n494\n00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.379\nAnd if they can't log in,\nthe system can't check in.\n\n495\n00:23:58.379 --> 00:24:01.082\nThey can't join it to a wireless\nnetwork for it to check in.\n\n496\n00:24:01.082 --> 00:24:04.201\nBut if the guest account is enabled,\nthey might choose guest and\n\n497\n00:24:04.201 --> 00:24:06.230\nthey might join a wireless network.\n\n498\n00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.420\nAnd now, your device starts phoning\nhome and you're able to find it.\n\n499\n00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.160\nSo when you turn on Find your Mac,\nit may turn that on.\n\n500\n00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.965\nI'm not logged in to iCloud here,\nso that's why my guest user's off.\n\n501\n00:24:16.965 --> 00:24:19.630\nnd I don't think I can even turn on\nFind My Mac right now unless I turn it\n\n502\n00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:20.520\nto iCloud.\n\n503\n00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.030\nSo if I were to connect this up to and\niCloud account,\n\n504\n00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:29.210\nI guess I have to remember a password\nto do this, let's see if that's right.\n\n505\n00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:33.530\nSo if I joined up to an iCloud account,\nonce it gets connected,\n\n506\n00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.940\nnow I'll start to see additional\noptions like that find my Mac option.\n\n507\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.950\nand when I turn that on,\nit may turn on your guest account.\n\n508\n00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:41.200\nSo don't be surprised if you go\ncheck out your user accounts and\n\n509\n00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.170\nthe guest account is turned on.\n\n510\n00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:47.100\nEven if you know it's a bad idea And\nit's because of Find My Mac, there we go.\n\n511\n00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:52.750\nSo, I'm turning on my iCloud account and\nsee how it's saying Find My Mac?\n\n512\n00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.340\nI'm not going to use all\nthese other options,\n\n513\n00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:01.000\nI'm going to allow it to find my Mac.\n\n514\n00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.530\nAll this other stuff,\n\n515\n00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.700\nI'm leaving turned off of\nFind My Mac as it's being turned on.\n\n516\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.070\nAnd it's telling me my\nMac can't be located at,\n\n517\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:11.600\nthe reason is I'm in a virtual\nmachine that doesn't have a GPS.\n\n518\n00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.810\nI'm not joined to a wireless network,\nso it really has no idea where it is.\n\n519\n00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.630\nBut on a normal system,\nit would immediately find itself and\n\n520\n00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:18.910\nit would be in business.\n\n521\n00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:23.060\nAnd then on your user account,\nit's going to turn on that guest account.\n\n522\n00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.150\nAnd see how that guest\nuser is enabled now?\n\n523\n00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.250\nI didn't do that,\nwe saw it just a minute ago,\n\n524\n00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.480\nit was off, now it's enabled and managed.\n\n525\n00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.170\nThey've turned it on and they've\nturned on parental controls for it, so\n\n526\n00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.020\nit is a very restricted one.\n\n527\n00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:40.190\nThe theory is whoever steals this device\nis now going to be able to log in, so\n\n528\n00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.030\nwe can find out where the device is.\n\n529\n00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.440\nThe guest account is a special user\naccount that's created by the system and\n\n530\n00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.770\nwe can't really do anything to it\nother than turn it on and off.\n\n531\n00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.520\nThere's one more special\naccount that we never see, it's\n\n532\n00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.120\ncompletely hidden away in the background\nand that's the route user account.\n\n533\n00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.560\nOn a Unix system, you have a root\nuser account who it the super user.\n\n534\n00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.690\nThey have the power to do\neverything on the system,\n\n535\n00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.070\nunbridled power and energy, right.\n\n536\n00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:11.720\nSo if an attacker gets your root account,\nit's really, really bad.\n\n537\n00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.210\nAt that point you've lost all protection\non your system, and things are bad.\n\n538\n00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.360\nSo that one needs to be protected and\nit's hidden.\n\n539\n00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.940\nYou can't see it, it's not there, but\nit does exist, it is in the background.\n\n540\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.210\nIn fact,\nwhenever I perform an administrative task,\n\n541\n00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.520\nlike when I unlock this user account.\n\n542\n00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.493\nIt's asking me to login\nas an administrator and\n\n543\n00:26:29.493 --> 00:26:31.970\nwhat it's really doing is,\nelevating my privileges.\n\n544\n00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.380\nSo let me show you,\nit's easiest to see it in the terminal.\n\n545\n00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:40.530\nSo in the terminal, there is a command\nyou can run called whoami and\n\n546\n00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:44.180\nif you run an whoami,\noddly enough it tells you who you are.\n\n547\n00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.040\nSo right now,\nI can see that I am on dpezet.\n\n548\n00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.020\nSo when I run whoami,\n\n549\n00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:51.760\nit tells me I am logged in as dpezet,\nthere's a command we can run.\n\n550\n00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.600\nWell, really any command that\nyou run is going to run as you.\n\n551\n00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.010\nSo if I run the top command, it's going\nto start showing me my CPU usage and\n\n552\n00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:00.420\nit's running as deep as that.\n\n553\n00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.450\nSo if I were to fire up my activity\nmonitor and come in here and\n\n554\n00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.870\nfind where that top command is running.\n\n555\n00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:10.162\nIs actually going to be part\nof the terminal I guess and\n\n556\n00:27:10.162 --> 00:27:13.390\nit doesn't actually show\nthe individual process.\n\n557\n00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:14.882\nWell, I can look at it\nthrough the terminal,\n\n558\n00:27:14.882 --> 00:27:16.706\nI guess it'd probably be a better way,\nin the terminal\n\n559\n00:27:18.703 --> 00:27:22.998\nIf I'll find that top command,\nwe can find the top and\n\n560\n00:27:22.998 --> 00:27:28.070\nsee our top is running and\nit's showing it's running by root.\n\n561\n00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.660\nWhat I'm going to do is,\nI dpezet, aren't I.\n\n562\n00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.010\nWell, I'm an administrator, and\n\n563\n00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.810\nI'm running tasks in\nan administrative context.\n\n564\n00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:41.100\nAnd so, it's running as that\nother process, or other account.\n\n565\n00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.120\nSo when I run things,\nyou can change your context.\n\n566\n00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.070\nWhen I run whoami, well I'm just dpezet.\n\n567\n00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:51.510\nBut if I use the sudo command,\nwhich is the super user do.\n\n568\n00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.400\nDo this command as the super user, and\n\n569\n00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.510\nI run something like who am I,\nit's going to elevate my privileges.\n\n570\n00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.870\nSo it asks for my password and\n\n571\n00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.820\nonce I have it, it's going to run it and\nyou see who it ran it as?\n\n572\n00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.890\nRoot, so\n\n573\n00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:09.100\nwhenever you do something administrative,\nyou're actually doing it as the root user.\n\n574\n00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.990\nNow you can't login as the root user,\n\n575\n00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:13.420\nwhen you get to the login\nscreen root doesn't show up.\n\n576\n00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:18.840\nI can't login as that user, but\nyou could elevate your privileges and\n\n577\n00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.760\nyou can take over that role and\nyou can become that user.\n\n578\n00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.040\nNow the user account itself,\nlike if I run su,\n\n579\n00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.870\nthat's the super user command which\nis going to convert me to root.\n\n580\n00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.890\nAnd I would have to know the root\nusers password, only I don't know it,\n\n581\n00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.410\nApple doesn't tell you it.\n\n582\n00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:37.700\nApple securely sets the password for that\nroot account, so that you can't long in.\n\n583\n00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.640\nAnd the dirty little secret,\nif you want to know what the password is,\n\n584\n00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.910\nI actually know what it is.\n\n585\n00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.920\nIt's nothing, it doesn't have a password,\n\n586\n00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.730\nApple has rendered that we\ncan't login to that account.\n\n587\n00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:50.160\nIt has no password, which is not allowed\nand so, the account can't be logged in as.\n\n588\n00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.730\nSo, you're limited to\nusing your sudu command.\n\n589\n00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.730\nSo if an attacker tries to\nexploit the root account,\n\n590\n00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:58.360\nthey really can't unless they have your\nadministrative password and access.\n\n591\n00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.170\nSo, that root user account,\nit does exist and it is in the background.\n\n592\n00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:05.810\nYou are using it when you elevate\nprivileges but it's completely hidden.\n\n593\n00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.370\nSo those are some on\nthe accounts that are out there.\n\n594\n00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.910\nMost of them are the ones\nthat you make yourself, but\n\n595\n00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.910\nthen there's the guest user and\nthe root user.\n\n596\n00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:16.740\nThose are special ones that are in\nthe background that are important.\n\n597\n00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.690\nVery good,\nwe've been looking at in this episode of\n\n598\n00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.450\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n599\n00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:22.540\nWe've been looking at\nmanaging your user accounts.\n\n600\n00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.620\nDon, got anything else for us in this one?\n\n601\n00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.650\n>> With each user account, there is a lot\nmore to it than just the account itself.\n\n602\n00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:29.830\nI want to walk you guys through\nthe home directories and\n\n603\n00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.675\nhow they work,\nI know we mentioned them briefly.\n\n604\n00:29:31.675 --> 00:29:34.060\nIt's important how those home\ndirectories get tied to us, and\n\n605\n00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.316\nsome of the default permissions.\n\n606\n00:29:35.316 --> 00:29:37.820\nSo we're going to look at that,\nbut I know we're short on time,\n\n607\n00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:38.540\nWes is giving me the eye.\n\n608\n00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.620\nSo why don't we wrap this one up Wes and\nlet's do a part two, so\n\n609\n00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.630\nI can get into those home folders.\n\n610\n00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:43.570\n>> That sounds great.\n\n611\n00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.720\nSo stick around, because we do have\nmore coming up in this episode, but\n\n612\n00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.270\nwe're going to save it for another time.\n\n613\n00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:51.180\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n614\n00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:51.870\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n615\n00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:53.153\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n616\n00:29:53.153 --> 00:29:57.379\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.804\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:21.452\nwe're gonna be moving along in our\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:21.452 --> 00:00:27.250\nAnd we're gonna be diving into a part two,\nyes, again, we talked a lot in part one.\n\n6\n00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.890\nWe had to come back at you\nwith a sequel here today.\n\n7\n00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.850\nSo today in the studio, we got none\nother than Mr. Don Pezet to help us out.\n\n8\n00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.400\nDon, how're you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.240\n>> I'm doing good, Wes, and\nam ready to jump in and\n\n10\n00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.170\nfinish up our discussion on user accounts.\n\n11\n00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.940\nIn part one,\n\n12\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.218\nwe got a chance to see what those user\naccounts were like inside of MacOS.\n\n13\n00:00:44.218 --> 00:00:46.877\nAnd we saw that there were four\ndifferent kinds of user accounts that we\n\n14\n00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:49.178\ncould create, and\nthere were groups that we could create and\n\n15\n00:00:49.178 --> 00:00:51.340\na lot of stuff that you can\nmess around with there.\n\n16\n00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.600\nSo we kinda got exposure to that,\ncreating the accounts, using the accounts.\n\n17\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.820\nNow I wanna talk a little bit more about\nwhat is attached to each account and\n\n18\n00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.660\nhow we can get rid of the accounts\nthat we don't need anymore.\n\n19\n00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.530\nSo there's a couple of neat little things\nthat we just need to address before we\n\n20\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.880\nwrap this one up for the exam topics.\n\n21\n00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.942\nSo let's start off with what\nthose user accounts are.\n\n22\n00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:13.200\nNow in the last episode,\nwe talked about standard users and\n\n23\n00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.880\nadmin users and managed users,\nthe ones with parental controls.\n\n24\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.090\nAll three of those\nare actually the same thing.\n\n25\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.440\nThey're all user accounts,\nthey just have different permissions.\n\n26\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.740\nAn admin has full permission\nto do whatever they want.\n\n27\n00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.380\nA standard user has permission to log\nin and run applications and do work.\n\n28\n00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.170\nA managed user has permission to log in,\ndo work but\n\n29\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.720\nthey're restricted by parental controls.\n\n30\n00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.680\nBut at the end of the day,\nall three of them are just user accounts.\n\n31\n00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.710\nThe only one that was really different\nwas the shared user account, right?\n\n32\n00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.320\nThe sharing only,\nwhen we created a sharing only account,\n\n33\n00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.850\nthat one isn't allowed to sit down and\nlog in on your computer.\n\n34\n00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.970\nThey can only access it via the network.\n\n35\n00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.970\nAnd so\nwhen I mentioned that in the last episode,\n\n36\n00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.420\nI said the big difference between\nthat sharing only account and\n\n37\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.110\nthe other accounts is that sharing\nonly accounts don't get a home folder.\n\n38\n00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.120\nBut we didn't really talk about\nthat home folder much at all, so\n\n39\n00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.797\nthat's where I wanna pick up right here,\nis jump into, what is a home folder,\n\n40\n00:02:07.797 --> 00:02:09.501\nand what makes it special, right?\n\n41\n00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:12.622\nAnd it's kinda simple, most of you\nguys probably already know this, so\n\n42\n00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:14.680\nI'm really kinda visiting\na basic topic here.\n\n43\n00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.380\nBut a home folder's just where\nyou put your stuff, right,\n\n44\n00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.970\nso every user account needs a home,\nsome place they can put their things.\n\n45\n00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.650\nAnd those things, they might be documents,\nthey might be music or videos.\n\n46\n00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.610\nThey might be your preferences.\n\n47\n00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.840\nSo, if I change the wallpaper on my\nlaptop, and then somebody else logs in and\n\n48\n00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.700\nthey change the wallpaper, how does\nthe Mac keep that separate, right?\n\n49\n00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.120\nSo let's say Wes logs in on my laptop and\nchanges the wallpaper.\n\n50\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.428\nWhen I log in,\nI get my old wallpaper back.\n\n51\n00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:42.990\nHow does it do that?\n\n52\n00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.713\nWell, Wes' preferences are stored\nin his home folder, and\n\n53\n00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:49.488\nmy preferences are stored\nin my home folder.\n\n54\n00:02:49.488 --> 00:02:53.100\nAnd when you log in,\nit's your home folder that's being read.\n\n55\n00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.840\nA sharing only account\ndoesn't have a home folder\n\n56\n00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.640\nbecause they never log in\ndirectly on the machine.\n\n57\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.170\nThey only log in via the network so\nthey don't need a wallpaper or\n\n58\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.120\nscreen saver timeout.\n\n59\n00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.050\nThey don't need any of that stuff cuz\nthey're not actually at the machine.\n\n60\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.440\nAll right, so let's revisit those\naccounts that I made in the last episode.\n\n61\n00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.140\nSo I'm gonna jump back into\nmy System Preferences, and\n\n62\n00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.780\nI'm gonna go into the User Accounts.\n\n63\n00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.400\nAnd we made a handful of accounts,\nright, and I made, well, I had my own,\n\n64\n00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.200\nthe admin account that was created for\nme when Mac OS was installed.\n\n65\n00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.660\nWe created a managed account for\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n66\n00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.200\nSo he has an account, but\nhe's got parental controls,\n\n67\n00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.190\nso he's restricted by that.\n\n68\n00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.040\nWe have an account for\nMike Rodrick, he's an admin.\n\n69\n00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.710\nRonnie, he's sharing only,\nWes, he's a standard user.\n\n70\n00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.310\nAnd then we've got that Guest account I\ntalked about a little bit too, all right?\n\n71\n00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.810\nNow, let's take a look\nat the home folders.\n\n72\n00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.290\nNow, where are the home folders stored?\n\n73\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.240\nWell, it's pretty easy.\n\n74\n00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.410\nIf you jump into your Macintosh HD, so I'm\ngonna go into the Macintosh hard drive.\n\n75\n00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.720\nOn the hard drive,\nyou've got a folder called Users, and\n\n76\n00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.070\nthat's where everybody's home folder is.\n\n77\n00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.616\nAnd so if I browse in there,\nthere's dpezet, daniellowrie, wesbryan,\n\n78\n00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:01.361\nmikerodrick, Guest.\n\n79\n00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:05.740\nAnd notice there's no Ronnie Wong,\nRonnie's missing.\n\n80\n00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.080\nAnd that's because he was\na sharing only account.\n\n81\n00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.690\nHe's only gonna come in over the network,\nso\n\n82\n00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.170\nwe don't need a place to store his stuff.\n\n83\n00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.690\nBut everybody else's folder\nshows up right here.\n\n84\n00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.496\nNow, see how mine has that\ncool little house icon?\n\n85\n00:04:17.496 --> 00:04:21.580\nAnd nobody else's does,\nthat's because I'm logged in as me, and so\n\n86\n00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.980\nmy folder shows up with that house icon\nand knows that that's my home folder.\n\n87\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.590\nThese other ones aren't my home folder,\nright?\n\n88\n00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.630\nI'm not allowed to use Daniel's\nfolder as my home folder.\n\n89\n00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.850\nBut if I were to switch over to Daniel or\nMike or somebody else, here,\n\n90\n00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.630\nI'll switch over to Wes.\n\n91\n00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.739\nSo I'm gonna switch over to Wes' account.\n\n92\n00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.415\nAnd when I log in as Wes,\nhe can browse that folder and\n\n93\n00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:46.408\nhe'll see his with a little home icon and\nnot mine, right?\n\n94\n00:04:46.408 --> 00:04:52.040\nAnd what that is is it's basically\nsaying which one you're allowed to use.\n\n95\n00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.950\nNow for us as IT guys,\nwe're gonna browse in that user folder,\n\n96\n00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.910\nwe're gonna see this stuff.\n\n97\n00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.670\nYour average end user never does that,\nright?\n\n98\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.840\nWhat does your average end user do?\n\n99\n00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.160\nYour average end user just fires\nup the finder, and in the finder,\n\n100\n00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.660\nthey see the individual folders that\nare inside of their home directory.\n\n101\n00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.750\nThey don't necessarily browse to the\nuser's folder and then browse in that way.\n\n102\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.360\nThat's all kind of hidden, it's part\nof making it easy for them to use.\n\n103\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.480\nSo here I'm logging in as Wes, and this is\nthe first time that Wes has logged in to\n\n104\n00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.174\nthis computer, and that's why it took\na moment there to create his profile.\n\n105\n00:05:20.174 --> 00:05:22.410\nHe already had a home directory, but\n\n106\n00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.020\na default set of preferences were\nbeing applied to his account.\n\n107\n00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.350\nAnd so once those are set, he can log in.\n\n108\n00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.910\nAnd if he browses to the finder and\ngoes to the Macintosh hard drive,\n\n109\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.420\nhe can browse into users and see how\nwesbryan has that house icon and not me.\n\n110\n00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.280\nAll right, so\neverybody knows what their home folder is.\n\n111\n00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.700\nAnd if you browse into the home folder,\nyou'll see Desktop, Documents,\n\n112\n00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.050\nDownloads, Movies.\n\n113\n00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.380\nThis is where you put all your stuff.\n\n114\n00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.630\nAnd you don't have to browse to users and\nso on.\n\n115\n00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.910\nA lot of these already show up over here.\n\n116\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.990\nSo see how I've got Desktop,\nDocuments, Downloads, and right here,\n\n117\n00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.820\nI've got Desktop, Document, Downloads.\n\n118\n00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.590\nNow I don't have Movies, Music, Pictures,\nthose aren't showing up over here, but\n\n119\n00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.160\nwe can add them.\n\n120\n00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.540\nThese are just your favorites, right?\n\n121\n00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.250\nIn the finder, it keeps track\nof folders as a favorite, and so\n\n122\n00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.180\nyou can take these folders and\nyou can mark them as a favorite and\n\n123\n00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.716\nif I can drag and drop, there we go.\n\n124\n00:06:19.716 --> 00:06:23.340\nSo I can just drag and drop it over\nhere and add it to my favorites, and\n\n125\n00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.130\nnow Movies is part of my favorites,\nor Music, or whatever, right?\n\n126\n00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.770\nEach one of these I can throw them over\nhere, and now we'll have it, right?\n\n127\n00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.735\nAnd you can also go into\nfinder's preferences.\n\n128\n00:06:32.735 --> 00:06:36.380\nIn the finder preferences, you can\nchoose which ones show up in there too.\n\n129\n00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.020\nAnd it's right here under sidebar,\nand see how Movies, Music, Pictures?\n\n130\n00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.830\nI could have just checked those off,\nit would have been a little easier, but\n\n131\n00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.560\none neat option is that you can choose\nto show your home folder, right?\n\n132\n00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.150\nSo wesbryan shows up right there\nwith the little home icon.\n\n133\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.460\nAnd when I do that, now when I'm in\nthe finder, he's got an icon right here.\n\n134\n00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.858\nWe can jump right to his home folder and\nsee all this stuff, right?\n\n135\n00:06:57.858 --> 00:07:00.953\nBecause if you don't do that, the only way\nto find it is to browse to the hard drive,\n\n136\n00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:03.698\nbrowse to the users folder, and\nthen browse into your own directory, and\n\n137\n00:07:03.698 --> 00:07:05.470\nmost users don't know how to do that.\n\n138\n00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.340\n>> Now, Don, when a user is logging in for\n\n139\n00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.760\nthe first time, like you said,\nit sets a default set of preferences.\n\n140\n00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.190\nDoes it copy it like a template or\nis there like a template stored where it\n\n141\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.180\ncopies that down and\njust attaches my name to it?\n\n142\n00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.260\nIs that how it's working?\n\n143\n00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.190\n>> Yeah, there's a default profile.\n\n144\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.730\nAnd in the Unix world,\nthey call it a skeleton file.\n\n145\n00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.990\nIt's a folder structure that's built\naround what a user should have, and\n\n146\n00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.900\nthat's just being copied to\nthe user as part of that default.\n\n147\n00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.440\nSo that's what occurs,\nbut even after that,\n\n148\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.980\nthere's still some things that's gonna\nbe generated for you specifically.\n\n149\n00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.070\nAnd that's why that first\ntime you logged in,\n\n150\n00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.150\nyou notice that you had a folder\nalready even before you logged in.\n\n151\n00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.150\nThat's where that\nskeleton was copied over.\n\n152\n00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.649\nAnd then when you actually log in, that's\nwhen things start to get put in place.\n\n153\n00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:47.893\nAnd we'll see that some more later on,\n\n154\n00:07:47.893 --> 00:07:51.429\nlike when we get into the like\nmanaging profiles or whatever,\n\n155\n00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:55.307\nthat you can start to create that\ndefault profile to apply to users.\n\n156\n00:07:55.307 --> 00:07:57.993\nBut for the most part,\nthey just get a basic install like this,\n\n157\n00:07:57.993 --> 00:07:59.929\nthey browse in and\nthey start to work with it.\n\n158\n00:07:59.929 --> 00:08:02.845\nNow, for an end user,\nif I don't know about all those folders,\n\n159\n00:08:02.845 --> 00:08:05.600\nif I just start creating a document\nright here on my desktop.\n\n160\n00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.164\nSo maybe Wes wants to make a folder for\nWork Documents.\n\n161\n00:08:11.164 --> 00:08:14.140\nSo he starts to create that and\nit's right here on his desktop.\n\n162\n00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.870\nHe just sees it visually hey,\n\n163\n00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.520\nthere's the folder sitting right there and\nthat's that.\n\n164\n00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.980\nBut if you go into your finder and\nyou browse into your home directory.\n\n165\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.530\nAnd you go into the desktops folder,\nthere's Work Documents right there.\n\n166\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.450\nSo it is putting it in your profile and\nkeeping it separate.\n\n167\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:34.700\nNow, when you look at your profile,\nwe see these seven folders by default.\n\n168\n00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.920\nDesktop, Documents, Downloads,\nMovies, Music, Pictures, Public.\n\n169\n00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.370\nMost of these are pretty self explanatory.\n\n170\n00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.040\nDesktop, that's what\nshows up on your desktop.\n\n171\n00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.540\nDocuments, that's your documents folder\nwhere you're supposed to save your text\n\n172\n00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.350\nfiles and other things.\n\n173\n00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.764\nDownloads, any time you download a file\nfrom the Internet it's gonna go into\n\n174\n00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:53.297\nthat Download folder by default.\n\n175\n00:08:53.297 --> 00:08:55.050\nIn fact, if I fire up Safari, and\n\n176\n00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.258\nI don't know what's something\nwe can download real quick?\n\n177\n00:08:58.258 --> 00:09:01.781\nMaybe I don't care about security and\nI wanna download Java.\n\n178\n00:09:01.781 --> 00:09:03.528\nSo I'm gonna go and download Java.\n\n179\n00:09:03.528 --> 00:09:07.540\nI don't recommend this,\nI don't install it on my own.\n\n180\n00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.488\nBut when I went to Download, see how this\nlittle Download thing here just updated\n\n181\n00:09:12.488 --> 00:09:14.976\nand it shows that it downloading a file.\n\n182\n00:09:14.976 --> 00:09:16.600\nWhere is this file going?\n\n183\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.590\nWell it's actually going to\na temporary file right now, but\n\n184\n00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.760\nas soon as it has completed the download,\n\n185\n00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.320\nit's gonna go into the Downloads\nfolder that's in his user profile.\n\n186\n00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.250\nSo if I download something it\ngoes into my Download file.\n\n187\n00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.640\nIf he downloads it it goes into his.\n\n188\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.560\nWe all have our separate Download files.\n\n189\n00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.100\nSo there, it just finished.\n\n190\n00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.230\nAnd I could choose to run that\nJava image to install Java, and\n\n191\n00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.020\ncompletely destroy security on my system.\n\n192\n00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.940\nOr I can choose to open it in the Finder.\n\n193\n00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.538\nAnd if I open it in the Finder,\nit goes to that Downloads folder.\n\n194\n00:09:43.538 --> 00:09:45.650\nThat's the Downloads folder\nthat's a part of his profile.\n\n195\n00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.260\nWe've got Movies, Music and Pictures.\n\n196\n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.950\nThat's were we can put oddly enough,\nmovies, music and pictures.\n\n197\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.628\nNow if you have iTunes it's\ngonna create an iTunes library\n\n198\n00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:57.496\nwhich will be inside that music folder.\n\n199\n00:09:57.496 --> 00:10:00.820\nAnd iTunes can put music and\npictures inside of that too.\n\n200\n00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.420\nSo it kinda breaks the rules but\nif you've got the Photos app,\n\n201\n00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.540\nit will them in pictures and\nstore them there.\n\n202\n00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.290\nThe last one is Public.\n\n203\n00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.300\nPublic is an interesting folder.\n\n204\n00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:16.610\nThis is one where you put documents that\nyou want to share with everyone else.\n\n205\n00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.346\nSo let say Wes is working on\nsome super important document.\n\n206\n00:10:20.346 --> 00:10:24.888\nSo if files use text edit,\nthis is an important document very,\n\n207\n00:10:24.888 --> 00:10:28.260\nvery mission critical document here.\n\n208\n00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.730\nAnd he wants to share it with\neverybody on this computer.\n\n209\n00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.285\nNot necessarily the network, not\nnecessarily sharing it across the network\n\n210\n00:10:36.285 --> 00:10:40.056\nto everybody, but at least sharing it with\nother people on this computer like me or\n\n211\n00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.587\nMike or Ronnie,\nanybody else who has an account here.\n\n212\n00:10:42.587 --> 00:10:46.113\nSo he creates this document,\nthis important document, and by default\n\n213\n00:10:46.113 --> 00:10:50.420\nit's gonna save to the Documents\nfolder cuz that's where documents go.\n\n214\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.790\nSo if he goes in here and\nbrowses into documents, there it is.\n\n215\n00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.458\nBut I don't have access to\nhis Documents folder, do I?\n\n216\n00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:00.870\nWell I guess I'm a bad example,\ncuz I guess I'm an administrator.\n\n217\n00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.489\nSo let's switch to another user\nwho isn't an administrator.\n\n218\n00:11:03.489 --> 00:11:05.570\nI seem kinda out of non\nadministrators aren't I?\n\n219\n00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.160\nDaniel's not administrator, but\nhe's got parental controls.\n\n220\n00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.227\nLet's log in as him.\n\n221\n00:11:11.227 --> 00:11:12.860\nThe parental controls shouldn't stop me.\n\n222\n00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.950\nSo if I log in as Daniel and I try and\n\n223\n00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.100\nbrowse to Wes' Documents folder,\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n224\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.880\nWell, there's permissions on that folder\nthat are gonna stop me from accessing it.\n\n225\n00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.880\nI won't be able to get into it.\n\n226\n00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.930\nDaniel will actually be able to\nbrowse into Wes' folder, but\n\n227\n00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.980\nhe won't be able to get\ninto the documents.\n\n228\n00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.720\nHe doesn't have permission.\n\n229\n00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.200\nMeanwhile, if Wes copies that file and\nputs it in the Public folder,\n\n230\n00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.387\nDaniel can browse in the Public and\nhe can get at the documents.\n\n231\n00:11:41.387 --> 00:11:44.940\nNow, here's the important part, the thing\nyou need to remember for the exam.\n\n232\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.540\nYour Home folder is not private.\n\n233\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.583\nAnybody can browse to your Home folder.\n\n234\n00:11:50.583 --> 00:11:56.330\nIt's the subfolders underneath it that\nare private not the Home folder itself.\n\n235\n00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.290\nAnd the reason is because\nof that Public folder.\n\n236\n00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.240\nPeople need to be able to browse to get to\nthat Public folder to find those documents\n\n237\n00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.116\nthat you share around.\n\n238\n00:12:04.116 --> 00:12:08.250\nAnd they can't get there unless they have\npermissions on the parent folder also.\n\n239\n00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.620\nSo I'm logging in as Daniel right now.\n\n240\n00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.990\nThis restricted user.\n\n241\n00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.030\nAnd once I get logged in as him,\nhe can fire up the Finder.\n\n242\n00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:21.120\nAnd you see up here in my menu bar\nI'm logged in as Daniel Lowrie.\n\n243\n00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:27.420\nAnd if I go over here and\nI browse to, what is it doing?\n\n244\n00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.360\nOld VMware wants to run its little demon.\n\n245\n00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.820\nAnd Daniel is not allowed to do that,\nso I'll do it for him.\n\n246\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.456\nThere, so if he browses into Macintosh HD,\nhe can browse into users,\n\n247\n00:12:38.456 --> 00:12:41.376\nhe sees his home folder, and he sees Wes'.\n\n248\n00:12:41.376 --> 00:12:43.720\nAnd he can browse right into Wes'.\n\n249\n00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:49.330\nWes's home folder is not private but once\nhe's in Wes's folder, look what he's got.\n\n250\n00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.860\nSee these little minus\nsigns on all the folders?\n\n251\n00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.060\nHe's not allowed to get to them.\n\n252\n00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.240\nHe's not allowed to get to those\nfolders cuz they're private.\n\n253\n00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.290\nSo if he tries to browse into\nWes's desktop, can't be opened,\n\n254\n00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.650\nyou don't have permission.\n\n255\n00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.580\nOr the public folder,\nyou don't have permission.\n\n256\n00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.793\nSee he's being blocked out of these.\n\n257\n00:13:05.793 --> 00:13:09.960\nHe's being blocked out because\nthese are Wes' private files.\n\n258\n00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.667\nIf Wes were to put a file here\nin his actual home directory,\n\n259\n00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:15.037\nDaniel would see it.\n\n260\n00:13:15.037 --> 00:13:17.868\nHe might not have permission to open it,\nbut he would see that the file existed.\n\n261\n00:13:17.868 --> 00:13:19.460\nSo we do need to be aware of that.\n\n262\n00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.967\nNow, Wes' Public folder can't be opened,\nand I just said that's public.\n\n263\n00:13:24.967 --> 00:13:26.880\nIt's for\nstuff you wanna share with everybody.\n\n264\n00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.530\nWell we don't have sharing turned\non on this machine apparently.\n\n265\n00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:30.868\nSo I need to get that turned on.\n\n266\n00:13:30.868 --> 00:13:33.169\nSo if I jump back over to like Wes.\n\n267\n00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.970\nAnd we turn off file sharing, so\n\n268\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:42.590\nWes goes into his system preferences and\ngoes into Sharing.\n\n269\n00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.200\nAnd inside of Sharing actually, we do\nhave file sharing turned on, don't we?\n\n270\n00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.824\nSo we've got it turned on, and\nhis Public folder is turned on, so\n\n271\n00:13:50.824 --> 00:13:51.698\nit looks good there.\n\n272\n00:13:51.698 --> 00:13:54.134\nSo we should be able to hit\nover to the network at least.\n\n273\n00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:55.587\nAnd it might be because\nDaniel's restricted.\n\n274\n00:13:55.587 --> 00:13:59.145\nLet's switch over to my account,\nbecause I'm not restricted.\n\n275\n00:13:59.145 --> 00:14:00.910\nAnd what we should see\nis that Public folder.\n\n276\n00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.066\nNow, when I browse into Wes' folder,\nthere we go.\n\n277\n00:14:05.066 --> 00:14:06.130\nAnd I'm not able to get to them.\n\n278\n00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.050\nAnd actually that Public folder's\nstill restricted there too.\n\n279\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.917\nInteresting.\n\n280\n00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:12.180\nThat one should be available.\n\n281\n00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.210\nBecause once we're inside\nof that Public folder,\n\n282\n00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.810\nthere's actually another folder\nin there called Drop Box.\n\n283\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:22.211\nAnd that Dropbox folder is created by\ndefault because the Public folder will let\n\n284\n00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:23.598\nanybody read your data.\n\n285\n00:14:23.598 --> 00:14:25.597\nThey'll be able to read it and see it, but\n\n286\n00:14:25.597 --> 00:14:29.152\nthe Drop Box folder will let people\ndrop things off to upload things to it.\n\n287\n00:14:29.152 --> 00:14:32.463\nLet me go to my own home\nfolder I'll show you there,\n\n288\n00:14:32.463 --> 00:14:37.390\nwhen I go to my home folder and\nbrowse there this Public folder.\n\n289\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:42.100\nIf we look at the permissions that are on\nit, let me just do a get info here.\n\n290\n00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.440\nAnd we look at that, we can come\ninto sharing and permissions and\n\n291\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.140\nnotice how everyone has\nRead only permissions.\n\n292\n00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.010\nEveryone, everybody can\nread what's in this folder.\n\n293\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.460\nThat's the permissions on it.\n\n294\n00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.010\nThe other folder's not like that.\n\n295\n00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:00.940\nIf I take something like my desktop,\nand I get the info on my desktop and\n\n296\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.510\ndo the same thing and come down and\nlook at the permissions.\n\n297\n00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.990\nEveryone has Custom.\n\n298\n00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.646\nAnd those Custom permissions,\nwe actually can't see it right here.\n\n299\n00:15:08.646 --> 00:15:10.486\nBut are just that they can\ncheck the permissions on it,\n\n300\n00:15:10.486 --> 00:15:11.933\nsee where they have access and that's it.\n\n301\n00:15:11.933 --> 00:15:14.432\nThey can't actually get in it.\n\n302\n00:15:14.432 --> 00:15:18.455\nSo that Public folder,\nit's available for everyone.\n\n303\n00:15:18.455 --> 00:15:21.562\nAnd if you browse into that\nPublic folder and take a look,\n\n304\n00:15:21.562 --> 00:15:24.875\nthere's a folder called Drop Box,\nand I didn't make that.\n\n305\n00:15:24.875 --> 00:15:25.980\nThat's part of the profile.\n\n306\n00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.767\nIt's there automatically, and\nif we get its info and take a look at it.\n\n307\n00:15:29.767 --> 00:15:33.430\nRight here,\nyou'll see everyone has Write only.\n\n308\n00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.260\nThey can write files.\n\n309\n00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.910\nIf Wes wants to give me a file,\nhe can put it in my Drop Box, and\n\n310\n00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.760\nI'll have access to it.\n\n311\n00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.225\nSo if I jump over to Wes, and\nWes wants to give me that file.\n\n312\n00:15:44.225 --> 00:15:47.375\nHe could put it in his Public folder and\nI could access it that way,\n\n313\n00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:49.810\nassuming the permissions are right.\n\n314\n00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:54.665\nOr he could take that file, he could\nbrowse to the hard drive, browse to Users,\n\n315\n00:15:54.665 --> 00:15:55.979\nbrowse into dpezet.\n\n316\n00:15:55.979 --> 00:15:58.628\nAnd see how my Public folder\ndoesn't have that minus sign.\n\n317\n00:15:58.628 --> 00:15:59.929\nThese are the right permissions.\n\n318\n00:15:59.929 --> 00:16:03.099\nAnd when we browse into there,\nhe can read my documents.\n\n319\n00:16:03.099 --> 00:16:05.212\nAnd he drop things in the Dropbox.\n\n320\n00:16:05.212 --> 00:16:08.390\nNow he can only write to the Dropbox,\nhe can't read.\n\n321\n00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.570\nSo if he double-clicks on that\nhe doesn't have permission.\n\n322\n00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:17.150\nBut what he can do is he can open\nup another finder window here.\n\n323\n00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.150\nLet's get into another finder window.\n\n324\n00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.310\nHe can go to his documents.\n\n325\n00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.720\nHe can find that important document.\n\n326\n00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.120\nHe can drag it and drop it on my Dropbox.\n\n327\n00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.090\nAnd It's telling me you can\nput items into the Dropbox but\n\n328\n00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.380\nyou won't be able to see them.\n\n329\n00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.730\nIn other words once its there\nyou can't take it back.\n\n330\n00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.860\nSo he just copied that file to me and now,\n\n331\n00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.900\nI can log back in and\nwhen I go into my public folder.\n\n332\n00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:49.320\nHere, and I go into my Dropbox, there's\nthe important document he just sent me and\n\n333\n00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.820\nnow I can read it and work with it.\n\n334\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.600\nSo we've kind of got sharing between\nthe users right here in our local system.\n\n335\n00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.290\n>> Now Don,\none of the things that I've noticed and\n\n336\n00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:59.380\nyou mentioned at the beginning of this\nshow here is that there are a set of\n\n337\n00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.840\ndefault preferences that get copied over\nthe first time the user logs in, but\n\n338\n00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:10.360\nthen you showed that we started,\nbasically changing your preferences.\n\n339\n00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.190\nBut I don't see any folder when it\ncomes to storing those settings.\n\n340\n00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:14.810\nWhere are those settings stored?\n\n341\n00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.310\n>> So there's some hidden folders\nthat we don't see, right?\n\n342\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.200\nSo when I look at my profile,\nI see these seven folders.\n\n343\n00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.970\nYou actually might see an eighth one.\n\n344\n00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.210\nIf you've installed an application and\nchose to install it just for\n\n345\n00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.180\nyou, then it'll actually\nmake an Applications folder.\n\n346\n00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.470\nAnd you can make it manually if you want.\n\n347\n00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.640\nIf you just make a folder called\nApplications, see how it recognized it and\n\n348\n00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.040\ngave it that special icon?\n\n349\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.655\nIt knows that that's my\nown application folder.\n\n350\n00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:39.305\nAnd any applications I throw in there\nwill just be available to me and\n\n351\n00:17:39.305 --> 00:17:40.435\nnot other people.\n\n352\n00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:43.635\nSo there's files like that that\nare either not there by default or\n\n353\n00:17:43.635 --> 00:17:45.245\njust outright hidden.\n\n354\n00:17:45.245 --> 00:17:48.535\nSo right now I've got eight of\nthese files, or eight folders.\n\n355\n00:17:48.535 --> 00:17:51.405\nIf I jump into my terminal and\n\n356\n00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:53.965\nbrowse into my home directory\nwhich is the default, right?\n\n357\n00:17:53.965 --> 00:17:54.555\nSo that's where I'm at.\n\n358\n00:17:54.555 --> 00:17:56.040\nThis is my home directory.\n\n359\n00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.907\nAnd I'm gonna do an ls-la.\n\n360\n00:17:57.907 --> 00:18:02.840\nThe -a is showing show me all files,\neven hidden ones.\n\n361\n00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.760\nAnd when I look in there,\nI see Applications, Desktop,\n\n362\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.320\nDocuments, Downloads, Movies,\nMusic, Pictures, Public.\n\n363\n00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.990\nThose are the eight that we saw\na moment ago, but I also see Library.\n\n364\n00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.410\nAnd Library that's the one where\nmy preferences are stored.\n\n365\n00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.350\nIt's hidden by default in the UI right?\n\n366\n00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.560\nSo here in the UI I don't see Library.\n\n367\n00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.480\nYou can actually get to it though.\n\n368\n00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.220\nIf you use Finder's Go menu, so when I'm\nin the Finder if I go up to my Go menu,\n\n369\n00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.750\nsee I've got shortcuts for all of this\nstuff, Documents, Desktop, Downloads and\n\n370\n00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:38.670\nso on, if you hold the Option\nkey while you're in that menu,\n\n371\n00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.870\nit makes that hidden library show up.\n\n372\n00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:45.290\nSo you go into the Finder, you pull\ndown the Go menu, you hit Option and\n\n373\n00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:46.020\nLibrary shows up.\n\n374\n00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.730\nAnd you can browse right to it and\nnow I'm in there.\n\n375\n00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:49.954\nAnd right in here,\n\n376\n00:18:49.954 --> 00:18:54.555\nyou'll see tons of stuff including\na preferences folder just for you.\n\n377\n00:18:54.555 --> 00:18:58.688\nAnd that's where all your preferences are\nstored for the dock and everything else.\n\n378\n00:18:58.688 --> 00:19:01.379\nHere's the touchpad settings,\nthe mouse settings,\n\n379\n00:19:01.379 --> 00:19:05.460\nall this corresponds to the system\npreferences but it's just for you.\n\n380\n00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.840\nSo, those are all kind\nof tucked away in there.\n\n381\n00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.800\nNow, this user profile it's kind\nof important this home directory,\n\n382\n00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.940\nbecause everything I do, as I work\nwith my account as I use my system,\n\n383\n00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.578\nis getting stored there.\n\n384\n00:19:16.578 --> 00:19:20.790\nWell over time, you may find that\nyou don't need a user anymore.\n\n385\n00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.270\nSo maybe Wes decides he's gonna quit.\n\n386\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.080\nThis place stinks, I'm out of here, right?\n\n387\n00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.350\nOkay, fine, so Wes is gone.\n\n388\n00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.040\nI'm gonna delete his user account.\n\n389\n00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.970\nSo I'm gonna jump into System Preferences,\nand I'm gonna go into Users and Groups,\n\n390\n00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.670\nand I'm gonna find his account,\nand we're just gonna kick him out.\n\n391\n00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.340\nThat's the end of Wes.\n\n392\n00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.540\nI've been waiting for\nthis day for so long.\n\n393\n00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.020\nSo [LAUGH] I'm going to go in here and\nfind Wes.\n\n394\n00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.060\nDid I type the wrong password?\n\n395\n00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.020\nI must have typed the wrong password.\n\n396\n00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.910\nIt's thinking.\n\n397\n00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.520\nSo I'm gonna find Wes and click on him and\n\n398\n00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.700\nI'm gonna hit this little minus\nsign to delete him and, why is?\n\n399\n00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.230\nIt's cuz he's logged in right now.\n\n400\n00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.300\nThat's why it's grayed out.\n\n401\n00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.940\nLet me go log Wes out.\n\n402\n00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.610\nSo I'm gonna switch over to Wes again and\nlog him out.\n\n403\n00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.370\nYou can't delete a user while\nthey're actively using the system.\n\n404\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:05.040\n>> I was gonna say.\n\n405\n00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.400\nApparently, I'm my own worst enemy there.\n\n406\n00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.680\n>> You just won't go away.\n\n407\n00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.180\nSo I'm gonna log him out real quick.\n\n408\n00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.760\nAnd then I'll log back in as me.\n\n409\n00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.950\nAnd once I'm back in here as me,\nI can delete his account.\n\n410\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:20.600\nNow when I delete his account, it's gonna\nask me about his home directory, right?\n\n411\n00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.120\nSo here I've got them chosen and\nI'm gonna hit that little minus sign.\n\n412\n00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.310\nAnd it's gonna give me some options.\n\n413\n00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.080\nThere's three options,\nsort of four but really three.\n\n414\n00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.565\nThe first one is I'm gonna\ndelete his user account and\n\n415\n00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:34.115\nsave his home folder in a disk image.\n\n416\n00:20:34.115 --> 00:20:38.125\nIt will make a .DMG file that\ncontains his home folder.\n\n417\n00:20:38.125 --> 00:20:40.145\nAnd all of his data is backed up.\n\n418\n00:20:40.145 --> 00:20:43.455\nAnd that way, yeah,\nWes quit today and he walked out.\n\n419\n00:20:43.455 --> 00:20:47.565\nBut I might not realize that he\nhad a file I needed for two weeks,\n\n420\n00:20:47.565 --> 00:20:50.015\na month,\nthree months later I'm like, shoot,\n\n421\n00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:54.290\nWes had those show notes I need to get\naccess, no, I deleted his account.\n\n422\n00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:55.430\nThey're gone.\n\n423\n00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:59.230\nSo this option is neat,\nbecause it saves that data.\n\n424\n00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.430\nEverything's part of his user profile,\nand I can bring it back later.\n\n425\n00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.540\nYou can choose to don't\nchange the home folder.\n\n426\n00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.270\nDelete the user account but\nleave the home folder right where it is.\n\n427\n00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.630\nIt says don't change the home folder.\n\n428\n00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:12.910\nIt actually does change it.\n\n429\n00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.130\nWhat it does, it just renames it.\n\n430\n00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.070\nSo right now it's called Wes Bryan.\n\n431\n00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.260\nAfterwards it'll be Wes Bryan and\n\n432\n00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.740\nin parentheses it'll say like deleted or\nsomething like that.\n\n433\n00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.680\nIt just adds a little bit to the name.\n\n434\n00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.790\nAnd then delete the home folder.\n\n435\n00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.660\nForget it.\nWes never did anything important around\n\n436\n00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.650\nhere anyway, let's just delete him and\nget rid of all his data.\n\n437\n00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:28.740\nSo you can choose to delete it.\n\n438\n00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.170\nNow when you delete it,\nit's not a secure delete.\n\n439\n00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.930\nWhich means somebody could run data\nrecovery software like Disk Warrior and\n\n440\n00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.790\nrecover it, right.\n\n441\n00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.058\nYou can choose to erase it securely.\n\n442\n00:21:40.058 --> 00:21:41.610\nNow it's gonna erase his data and\n\n443\n00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.880\nit's gonna do a multipass erase on\nthe sectors of the hard drive, so\n\n444\n00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.360\nit writes ones and zeros, ones and\nzeros to try and clear it out.\n\n445\n00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.277\nAnd that stops people from being\nable to use magnetic forensics and\n\n446\n00:21:52.277 --> 00:21:55.730\nother technologies to be able to try to\nrecover the data from that home folder.\n\n447\n00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.690\nSo if you're super paranoid you can do\nthat but that's like a mega delete.\n\n448\n00:21:58.690 --> 00:21:59.510\nRight?\n\n449\n00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.900\nBut I'm going to choose to save\nthe home folder in a disk image and\n\n450\n00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.700\nsee how it tells me if I do that it's\ngoing to put it in a deleted users folder.\n\n451\n00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.030\nSo I'm going to delete him.\n\n452\n00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.230\nSo now Wes is gone.\n\n453\n00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.840\nRight?\nWell it's in process.\n\n454\n00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.430\nSee how it says deleting account?\n\n455\n00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.860\nHis account is disabled, but it's\nstill making that image of his folder.\n\n456\n00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.107\nAnd as soon that it's\ndone now he's gone and\n\n457\n00:22:19.107 --> 00:22:22.250\nif I browse on the hard\ndrive to that user's folder.\n\n458\n00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.850\nSo I'm gonna go into my hard drive.\n\n459\n00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.940\nI'm gonna go into the user's folder and\nonce I'm in the user's folder,\n\n460\n00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.970\nI've got a new folder that\nappeared called Deleted User's and\n\n461\n00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:36.070\nif I go on Deleted User's,\nthere's wesbryan.dmg right?\n\n462\n00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.150\nI can set this aside, copy it to a DVD,\nwhatever it is I want to do.\n\n463\n00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.580\nAnd then later on down the road\nif I realize I need that back,\n\n464\n00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.420\nI can double-click on his account,\nor on that DMG file, it'll mount and\n\n465\n00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.520\nthere's his whole profile.\n\n466\n00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.250\nI can get all his data again,\nall right here.\n\n467\n00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:50.880\nRight?\n\n468\n00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.590\nNow, notice there's no library file\nin here, so if it was hidden before,\n\n469\n00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:55.500\nit's still hidden now.\n\n470\n00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.710\nSo we have that problem.\n\n471\n00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.770\nBut it is in there.\n\n472\n00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.030\nIf I were to browse to it through the hard\ndrive and find that data, it's there.\n\n473\n00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.630\nNow, if I had deleted the user.\n\n474\n00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.610\nLet's take somebody else,\nlike Daniel, right, he's logged in.\n\n475\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.290\nWe'll take Mike, Mikes not logged in.\n\n476\n00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:10.320\nSo, I'm going to take Mike, and\n\n477\n00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.120\nif I'm gonna delete him, this time I'm\ngonna choose don't change the home folder.\n\n478\n00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.120\nAnd I'll delete that user.\n\n479\n00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.340\nSo, I deleted him and\ntold it not to change the home folder.\n\n480\n00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.630\nNow, if I go back here and\nI browse in to my hard drive and\n\n481\n00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.090\nusers, there's mikeroderick.\n\n482\n00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.192\nWhile it said it wasn't gonna change it,\nit did.\n\n483\n00:23:27.192 --> 00:23:29.350\nSee how it put deleted\nwith parenthesis on it.\n\n484\n00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.790\nSo, Mike's been deleted.\n\n485\n00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.450\nWhy did it do that?\n\n486\n00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:36.390\nIt does that because if I create\na new user called Mike Rodrick,\n\n487\n00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:38.720\nthat's an entirely separate user account.\n\n488\n00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.080\nIt's a new account.\n\n489\n00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.880\nRemember the new UID we\nsaw in the last episode?\n\n490\n00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.950\nWhen I make a new Mike Rodrick it's gonna\nhave a new UUID, it's not gonna match.\n\n491\n00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.460\nIt thinks it's a separate person.\n\n492\n00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.661\nAnd so, they need to be able to\nget a home folder with their name.\n\n493\n00:23:50.661 --> 00:23:54.791\nBy putting deleted on this one, I can\ncreate a new user with the same name and\n\n494\n00:23:54.791 --> 00:23:58.347\nthey'll get their own folder,\nwhich is normally what we want.\n\n495\n00:23:58.347 --> 00:24:00.843\nBut what if I made a mistake.\n\n496\n00:24:00.843 --> 00:24:04.719\nWhat if Wes, I'm sorry,\nI thought you were fired and\n\n497\n00:24:04.719 --> 00:24:09.830\nthen it turns out it was just\na miscommunication and you know.\n\n498\n00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.980\nSorry, you're still an employee but\nI deleted your account.\n\n499\n00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.010\nOkay.\n\n500\n00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.070\nUnfortunately there's no\nway to undelete an account.\n\n501\n00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.580\nI can't go in here and say, put Wes back.\n\n502\n00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.080\nAll I can do is create a new\naccount called Wes Brian, and\n\n503\n00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:27.000\nif I do that your home folder's gonna\nbe empty, right, all your data is gone.\n\n504\n00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.850\nSo what if I want to recover that?\n\n505\n00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.580\nWell, if I had a DMG that's pretty easy,\nI just recreate the account and I got that\n\n506\n00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.710\ndisc image, I can just pull the data\nback out of there and I'm in business.\n\n507\n00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.240\nBut there is another way to do it.\n\n508\n00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:42.190\nIf you still have the folder, like\nMike's folder here, you can take it and\n\n509\n00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:47.740\nremove the deleted flag from it,\nwhich I'm trying really hard to do.\n\n510\n00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.950\nWhy is it not letting me?\n\n511\n00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.990\nAll right, we'll do the old Ctrl+Click.\n\n512\n00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.774\nThere we go.\nI just want to get rid of that deleted,\n\n513\n00:24:53.774 --> 00:24:54.758\nthere, okay.\n\n514\n00:24:54.758 --> 00:24:58.644\nAnd I need to be in admin to do it,\nthere we go, so\n\n515\n00:24:58.644 --> 00:25:01.968\nI've renamed it back to Mike Roderick.\n\n516\n00:25:01.968 --> 00:25:07.278\nNow, I can go to users and groups,\nand I can create a new Mike Roderick.\n\n517\n00:25:07.278 --> 00:25:08.840\nNow, he's gone.\n\n518\n00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.030\nThis new Mike Roderick is going\nto have a different UUID.\n\n519\n00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:17.150\nBut what's gonna happen is,\nMacOS is smart enough to\n\n520\n00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:22.650\nrecognize that there's already a home\nfolder with this name right here.\n\n521\n00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:26.740\nAnd so when I hit Create User it's\ngonna see that folder and it's gonna\n\n522\n00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:31.128\nsay oops you've already got a folder\nwith that name, do you want to use it?\n\n523\n00:25:31.128 --> 00:25:35.647\nIf you choose to use it,\nall his preferences, his documents,\n\n524\n00:25:35.647 --> 00:25:38.726\nall of that data is\nmapped to this new UUID.\n\n525\n00:25:38.726 --> 00:25:41.570\nThe new user account gets access to it.\n\n526\n00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:46.860\nAnd he's right back to the way he was\nwith the exception of two things.\n\n527\n00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.360\nOne, his little icon here.\n\n528\n00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.250\nYou lose your icon,\nwhich nobody really cares about.\n\n529\n00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:51.610\nAnd the other thing is his password.\n\n530\n00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.370\nIt doesn't retain a password.\n\n531\n00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.940\nBut everything else, all his preferences,\nhis home directory, his favorites,\n\n532\n00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.850\nall that other stuff, all preserved.\n\n533\n00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.010\nAll right there.\n\n534\n00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:01.350\nHe's recovered and is back again.\n\n535\n00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.522\nWe're not technically undeleting him,\nwe're just recreating him and\n\n536\n00:26:04.522 --> 00:26:06.238\nmapping him back to his existing data.\n\n537\n00:26:06.238 --> 00:26:09.347\n>> Don, does that also include all\npermissions when you say preferences and\n\n538\n00:26:09.347 --> 00:26:12.055\nsettings, does that include any\npermissions that are set on any\n\n539\n00:26:12.055 --> 00:26:14.479\nof the folders or\napplications he might have had as well?\n\n540\n00:26:14.479 --> 00:26:18.440\n>> [LAUGH] Glad you asked that,\nWes, cuz it's yes and no.\n\n541\n00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.788\nYes on his folder, he now will have\nall his permissions on the folder.\n\n542\n00:26:21.788 --> 00:26:26.609\nBut because I created a new account for\nhim, any groups that he was in,\n\n543\n00:26:26.609 --> 00:26:28.600\nhe's not a part of anymore.\n\n544\n00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.880\nSo if we look at it here,\nI made Mike a standard user,\n\n545\n00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.140\nI even forgot to make him an admin because\nhe was an admin before, now he's not.\n\n546\n00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.270\nSo I need to make him an admin if\nI want him to be back that way, so\n\n547\n00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.620\nI can check that and make it.\n\n548\n00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.500\nBut I had also put him in a group.\n\n549\n00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.220\nWe have this show host group.\n\n550\n00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.390\nAnd well, actually you know what\nit did go on back in there.\n\n551\n00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.450\nWell now that really is interesting,\nI didn't know it did that.\n\n552\n00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:52.210\nI was pretty certain that it didn't\nbecause it's a different UUID, but\n\n553\n00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.500\nin this case maybe he miraculously got\nthe same, that would be scary if he did.\n\n554\n00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.890\nThat shouldn't happen, but\nyeah I guess it did put him back in there.\n\n555\n00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.195\nYou definitely want to double-check it,\nbecause it is technically a new user\n\n556\n00:27:02.195 --> 00:27:04.720\naccount and\nit very well may not be in those groups.\n\n557\n00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.340\nAnd so you may need to add him back in.\n\n558\n00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.710\nNormally I would say\nyou definitely need to,\n\n559\n00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:11.100\nbut in this case I can see he made\nit right back into that group.\n\n560\n00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.850\nSo sometimes things go strange.\n\n561\n00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.638\nBut once that's done, the user account\nis back and now you're recovered.\n\n562\n00:27:16.638 --> 00:27:18.518\nSo he's back to normal and\nyou're in there.\n\n563\n00:27:18.518 --> 00:27:21.100\nSo there's no official way\nto undelete the account.\n\n564\n00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.530\nYou just create a new one\nwith the same name and\n\n565\n00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.730\nif you've got the existing folder,\nit will connect those.\n\n566\n00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:28.730\nIf you don't have the existing folder\nthough then it is an all new account and\n\n567\n00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:29.590\nhe won't have that data.\n\n568\n00:27:31.078 --> 00:27:34.980\nAll right, so that's basically how we get\nthose restored and get those in place.\n\n569\n00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.351\nBut we had a question in our Q &\nA forums the other day that was centered\n\n570\n00:27:38.351 --> 00:27:39.800\naround this.\n\n571\n00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.960\nWhere somebody said, hey,\n\n572\n00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.390\nwhen I join an open directory I might have\na Don Pezet account here on this machine.\n\n573\n00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.328\nBut I just joined an Open Directory, and\n\n574\n00:27:47.328 --> 00:27:49.958\nI've got a Don Pezet account\nup in the Open Directory.\n\n575\n00:27:49.958 --> 00:27:53.368\nWhen I sign it with my Open Directory\naccount, do I get an all-new profile?\n\n576\n00:27:53.368 --> 00:27:54.340\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n577\n00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.200\nYour Open Directory account is\ndifferent from your local account, and\n\n578\n00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.080\nso you lose everything.\n\n579\n00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.430\nBut it's not lost, it's just in\na different folder on the hard drive.\n\n580\n00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:06.930\nSo after you log in that first time,\nyou can browse to your old folder and\n\n581\n00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:07.845\nget your data out of there.\n\n582\n00:28:07.845 --> 00:28:09.870\nYou'll have to clear permissions on it,\nright, so\n\n583\n00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.440\nyou have to provide your user name and\npassword.\n\n584\n00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.280\nBut once you do that you can grab\nyour data and bring it over and\n\n585\n00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.410\nnow you've got it copied over.\n\n586\n00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:19.200\nSo you do kind of get a new profile when\nyou join a directory and I'm talking about\n\n587\n00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.260\nApple's Open Directory but it's the same\nthing with Microsoft's Active Directory.\n\n588\n00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.100\nThat's a different account.\n\n589\n00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.200\nIt's an account stored somewhere else.\n\n590\n00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.478\nIt's not your local account.\n\n591\n00:28:25.478 --> 00:28:26.798\n>> All right, great information.\n\n592\n00:28:26.798 --> 00:28:30.490\nRemember in this episode, we've been\ntalking about managing the user accounts.\n\n593\n00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:32.158\nDo remember this is a Part 2.\n\n594\n00:28:32.158 --> 00:28:35.200\nIn Part 1, we talked about the type\nof accounts you can encounter when\n\n595\n00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.565\nyou're in the Mac world here.\n\n596\n00:28:36.565 --> 00:28:38.450\nDon, got anything else for us in this one?\n\n597\n00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.000\n>> That's about it for user accounts.\n\n598\n00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.910\nWe are gonna do some other\nepisodes that address user\n\n599\n00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.190\naccounts in a different manner.\n\n600\n00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:46.540\nSo I want to talk about multiple user\naccounts and a few other things there.\n\n601\n00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:47.620\nSo stay tuned for those.\n\n602\n00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.468\nBut as far as the creation and use of\nthe accounts, this is pretty much it.\n\n603\n00:28:50.468 --> 00:28:55.182\n>> All right, this does look like a good\nplace to wrap it up before I'm hired and\n\n604\n00:28:55.182 --> 00:28:57.846\nfired, so many times in a single episode.\n\n605\n00:28:57.846 --> 00:28:58.900\n>> Been a rough episode for you.\n\n606\n00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.780\n>> It really has, so while I'm still\nemployed, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n607\n00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.408\nsign off here.\n\n608\n00:29:02.408 --> 00:29:04.588\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Brian.\n\n609\n00:29:04.588 --> 00:29:05.388\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n610\n00:29:05.388 --> 00:29:07.368\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n611\n00:29:07.368 --> 00:29:14.850\n[SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:21.228\nand in today's episode we're gonna be\nmoving through our Apple certified\n\n4\n00:00:21.228 --> 00:00:25.720\nsupport professional program and we've\ngot none other than Don Pezet to help.\n\n5\n00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.220\nDon, how you doing sir?\n\n6\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.220\n>> I am doing great, Wes.\n\n7\n00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.400\nReady to kind of continue on with what\nwe've done in our last few episodes,\n\n8\n00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.870\nwe've been talking about user accounts,\nright?\n\n9\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.260\nAnd we got a chance to see how to create\nthem and work with them and all that.\n\n10\n00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.690\nI want to switch gears a bit here.\n\n11\n00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.020\nAnd I want to talk about some of\nthe things you need to be aware of,\n\n12\n00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.070\nwhen you have more than one user account.\n\n13\n00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.450\nWhen you get a brand new Mac,\nyou power it on the first time,\n\n14\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.230\nit runs a setup assistant, and\nit asks you to pick a user name.\n\n15\n00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.760\nAnd it makes an admin account for\nyou, so you have one account.\n\n16\n00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.650\nAnd the system runs great,\nit runs just fine with that one account.\n\n17\n00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.580\nBut, if you want to create\nmore than one user account\n\n18\n00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.140\nit starts to behave\na little differently and\n\n19\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.020\nwe need to understand what that behaviour\nis and how it works, all right.\n\n20\n00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.631\nSo, basically let's start with why I\nwould want more than one user account.\n\n21\n00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:10.141\nAnd if you watch the user episodes\nyou already kind of understand why.\n\n22\n00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:13.390\nUsers may want to have different settings.\n\n23\n00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.260\nIf I want users to have\nnice separate environments,\n\n24\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.960\nmultiple user accounts is the way to go.\n\n25\n00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.410\nSo let's say that I share\nmy computer with Wes.\n\n26\n00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.920\nSo this laptop I just leave\nright here on the desk and\n\n27\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.410\nat any point during the day one of\nthe show hosts can come in and use it.\n\n28\n00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.560\nI might want to set a Star Trek wallpaper,\nand\n\n29\n00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.820\nWes wants to set a Star Wars wallpaper.\n\n30\n00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.600\nAnd we can have our Star Wars\nversus Star Trek battle.\n\n31\n00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.240\nAnd so you want the different wallpaper.\n\n32\n00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.760\nWell I don't wanna come in and\nhave stinking Kylo Ren on my laptop or\n\n33\n00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.410\nsomething so\nI'm gonna want to change that.\n\n34\n00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.360\nIf we just have one account,\nyou're battling against each other.\n\n35\n00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.190\nYou also have no privacy.\n\n36\n00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.810\nSo if I create documents,\nlike a termination notice for\n\n37\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.860\nWes, he could just browse right in the\ndocuments and see that and be like, ooh,\n\n38\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.700\nI might need to get my resume ready,\nright.\n\n39\n00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.380\nSo if we wanna keep things private or just\nhave your own separation, keep your own\n\n40\n00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.300\nsettings and preferences, you'll want\nto create more than one user account.\n\n41\n00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.340\nIt's easy enough,\nwe've seen it in other episodes.\n\n42\n00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.760\nYou just jump in and\nyou start to create new accounts, right.\n\n43\n00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.700\nBut, the moment you create\na second account on your system,\n\n44\n00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.900\nthe behavior of that system changes,\nall right.\n\n45\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.870\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n46\n00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.920\nSo here I'm on a,\nthis is a stock install of Yosemite.\n\n47\n00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.590\nI just installed it and\nin the Wizard, the set-up assistant,\n\n48\n00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.130\nI created an account called Don Pezet,\nand that's who I'm logged in as.\n\n49\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.700\nSo if I go into my system preferences and\nI go into users and\n\n50\n00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.170\ngroups, we've just got one account,\nDon Pezet.\n\n51\n00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.170\nI'm an admin, the guest user is\nturned off, and that's it, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.960\nNow if I log out,\nwhen I first power on the computer,\n\n53\n00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.490\nit's gonna take me to the log on screen.\n\n54\n00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.550\nAnd at the log on screen,\nI'm just gonna see, Don Pezet.\n\n55\n00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.510\nThat's it, right there.\n\n56\n00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.010\nAnd if I hit this little back arrow,\nit doesn't really do anything,\n\n57\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.830\ncuz I've only got one account.\n\n58\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.980\nAnd I provide my password.\n\n59\n00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.290\nIf somebody wants to use the computer\nthey've got to have my password,\n\n60\n00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.970\nit's the only one.\n\n61\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.280\nBut the moment I create a second account,\nnow I'll have more than one icon\n\n62\n00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.540\non that screen, one for\neach of the users on the system.\n\n63\n00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.430\nAnd now other people can log in.\n\n64\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.180\nNow, when they log in they have\nexclusive access to that system.\n\n65\n00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.650\nBut I might want to make\nit where it's shared.\n\n66\n00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.380\nLet me explain the problem\nthat we bump into.\n\n67\n00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.620\nSo, right now, I've got one user account.\n\n68\n00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.260\nIf I lock my screen, a screensaver\ncomes on, it's got a password on it,\n\n69\n00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.070\nanybody who walks up to this computer,\nthey can't use it.\n\n70\n00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.780\nIt's locked, it's locked just for me.\n\n71\n00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.850\nBut when I create a second account,\nwhen I go into system preferences here and\n\n72\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.400\ngo into users and groups,\nI can create a second account.\n\n73\n00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.500\nBecause I want somebody else\nto be able to use my machine.\n\n74\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.790\nThe moment I do that, it's gonna turn\non what's called fast user switching.\n\n75\n00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.120\nIf you look up here at my menu bar, right\nnow I've got the clock and spotlight and\n\n76\n00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.550\nnotifications, right, and that's it.\n\n77\n00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.180\nBut the moment I create a second user,\nthat's gonna change.\n\n78\n00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.470\nSo I'm gonna create an account here for\nWes Bryan.\n\n79\n00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.940\nAnd so we'll create that account and\ngive him a password, and\n\n80\n00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.770\nI'll just make him a standard user.\n\n81\n00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.790\nSo I'm gonna create that account.\n\n82\n00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.870\nNow once that account's created,\nwatch my menu bar up here.\n\n83\n00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.980\nNow, instead of clock, spotlight,\n\n84\n00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.560\nnotifications, I have clock,\nmy name, spotlight, notifications.\n\n85\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.930\nWhat's that all about?\n\n86\n00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.430\nWell, this is fast user switching.\n\n87\n00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.940\nI can click that and I can see\nthe other users on the system and\n\n88\n00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.780\nI can switch over to one of them,\nall right?\n\n89\n00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.880\nSo I could come in here and I could\nsay I wanna switch over to Wes Bryan.\n\n90\n00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.620\nAnd when I do that,\nit's me because I'm still logged in, but\n\n91\n00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.080\nnow he's logged in also.\n\n92\n00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.040\nYou can have more than one person\nlogged in at the same time and\n\n93\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.580\nyou can switch back and forth by using\nthis menu right here, all right?\n\n94\n00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.000\nNow if I choose Login Window,\n\n95\n00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.440\nwhat that's gonna do is it's gonna\ntake me back to the login screen.\n\n96\n00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.400\nAnd on the login screen I now see\ntwo icons, one for each user.\n\n97\n00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.660\nOne for me and\n\n98\n00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.500\nthat little orange check mark, that lets\nme know that I'm currently logged in.\n\n99\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.750\nI'm already logged in and\nI'm running stuff and I'm doing things.\n\n100\n00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.180\nWes doesn't have a check mark.\n\n101\n00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.380\nHe's never logged in before, okay.\n\n102\n00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.102\nSo he can log in right now,\n\n103\n00:05:06.102 --> 00:05:10.350\nmy stuff's still running in the background\nand he logs in and he's able to work too.\n\n104\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.630\nSo let me just log back in as me,\nand I'm gonna run some programs.\n\n105\n00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.980\nSo I've got this thing fired up.\n\n106\n00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.140\nI'll fire up text edit and\nmaybe I'll start writing a document.\n\n107\n00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.320\nSo this is an important document,\nonly I'm not gonna save it,\n\n108\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.000\nI'm just gonna leave it right\nthere running in memory.\n\n109\n00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.870\nIf you shut your computer off you\nkind of lose what's in memory.\n\n110\n00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.420\nWell, actually there's that local time\nmachine now where it'll kinda save it, but\n\n111\n00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.040\nanyhow normally you'd lose it.\n\n112\n00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.610\nIf I fire up Safari and go to a webpage,\n\n113\n00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.392\nmaybe I go to our page,\nlet's go to Itpro.tv.\n\n114\n00:05:41.392 --> 00:05:43.230\nSo I'm just gonna browse around, so\n\n115\n00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.470\nI'm doing a couple of different things\nhere on the system logged in as me.\n\n116\n00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.650\nWhen I switch to Wes, so\nI'm gonna jump over to Wes and\n\n117\n00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.610\nI just hit that little name menu and\nchose Wes's name.\n\n118\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.030\nI can log in as him, he's logging in,\nI'm still logged in in the background.\n\n119\n00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.790\nAll those programs that I'm running?\n\n120\n00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.970\nThey’re still running in the background,\ntoo.\n\n121\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.070\nAnd he's gonna log in and\n\n122\n00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.550\nnow he can use the computer and\nmy stuff is still there, right.\n\n123\n00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.760\nThis way we can easily share the computer,\nhe can jump in,\n\n124\n00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.990\nhe's got his own account, he has his\nown home folder, profile and all that.\n\n125\n00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.370\nHe can change the wallpaper all he wants,\nand at the end of the day I can come back\n\n126\n00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.400\nand switch it back to me and everything's\nback to the way that it was for me.\n\n127\n00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.670\nIn fact, all my applications\nare still running, right?\n\n128\n00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.290\nAll the programs I was in, they're\nrunning, they're doing their thing.\n\n129\n00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.760\nMaybe I left some long running task going,\nand so\n\n130\n00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.310\nit's still doing that in the background.\n\n131\n00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.400\nBut there's certain behaviors that\nare now going to be different.\n\n132\n00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.640\nThe biggest difference is going to\nbe that we have concurrent use.\n\n133\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.490\nWe have more than one user\nrunning at the same time.\n\n134\n00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.790\nWes is running and I'm running.\n\n135\n00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.530\nWe both have little orange\ncheck marks by our name now.\n\n136\n00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.570\nAnd that means that I can have contention\nthat I wouldn't really normally have.\n\n137\n00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.880\nContention is when two people try and\naccess the same thing at the same time.\n\n138\n00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.125\nAs far as the built-in software in Mac OS,\nall of it is designed for\n\n139\n00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.230\nmulti-user environments.\n\n140\n00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.310\nBut what if I load third-party software?\n\n141\n00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:14.260\nWhat if I've got Microsoft Word or\nQuickBooks or Adobe Photoshop,\n\n142\n00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.430\nsomething like that installed?\n\n143\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.442\nThey're not really designed for two copies\nto be running at the same time, and\n\n144\n00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:25.050\neven the ones that are aren't designed\nto be able to access the same\n\n145\n00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.650\nfile at the same time.\n\n146\n00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.960\nWhat if Wes fires up Photoshop and\nhe's editing a picture, and\n\n147\n00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.470\nI fire up Photoshop and\nI'm editing the same picture.\n\n148\n00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.830\nWhat's gonna happen?\n\n149\n00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:40.460\nWell usually it lets us do it and\none person saves and\n\n150\n00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.640\nthe other person saves and\nwhoever saves last is the winner.\n\n151\n00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.040\nThey're the one that\noverwrites the file and\n\n152\n00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.410\nthe other person's changes are all gone,\nwe lose data.\n\n153\n00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.050\nSo you have to worry\nabout that contention.\n\n154\n00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.770\nYou don't want multiple people\naccessing the same information.\n\n155\n00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.534\nSometimes it's even worse if\nthere's a database involved.\n\n156\n00:07:56.534 --> 00:07:59.539\nA lot of times only one person will\nbe able to access that database.\n\n157\n00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:02.613\nIf the other person tries to do it,\nit'll show as being locked.\n\n158\n00:08:02.613 --> 00:08:04.912\nFiles get locked by a user.\n\n159\n00:08:04.912 --> 00:08:08.196\nSo if one person is editing it, and\nthe other person tries to open it,\n\n160\n00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:10.760\nit'd be locked, and\nthey'd be denied access to it.\n\n161\n00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.810\nThat's another problem we\nhave on multiple users.\n\n162\n00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:16.590\n>> Now Don, let's say that this is\na shared computer, and I'm working at it,\n\n163\n00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.500\nand I've got some sensitive\ndocumentation on a USB thumb drive.\n\n164\n00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.210\nI plug it into the Mac and\nI decide I'm gonna walk away, and\n\n165\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.760\nyou decide well, Wes,\nI really need this computer.\n\n166\n00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.700\nYou jump on it.\n\n167\n00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.700\nWhat's gonna happen to my thumb drive,\nand those documents?\n\n168\n00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.380\n>> Technically, they're not secure.\n\n169\n00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.930\nAnd I know that seems odd, right?\n\n170\n00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.570\nSo if you plug in removable media, and I\ndon't have a USB key sitting here for me,\n\n171\n00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.460\nbut if I were to throw one on right now,\nyou can actually customize removable media\n\n172\n00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.110\nto say whether or\nnot you honor permissions on it.\n\n173\n00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.250\nAnd a lot of times, we don't want to\nhonor permissions on a USB key, or\n\n174\n00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.640\nownership at least, because you might\nwant to take that USB key out and\n\n175\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.640\nplug it in a completely separate computer.\n\n176\n00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.780\nAnd is your user account\non that other computer?\n\n177\n00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.980\nNot necessarily, and so\nyou need to be able to access.\n\n178\n00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.790\nSo a lot of times, permissions\nare disabled on your removable media.\n\n179\n00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.810\nSo when you plug it into your computer,\nand\n\n180\n00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:06.150\nyou switch from one user account to\nanother, that other user has access to it.\n\n181\n00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.620\nNow, let's take it a step further.\n\n182\n00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.670\nLet's say that you encrypt that USB key.\n\n183\n00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.340\nLet's say you apply FileVault to it,\nand you've encrypted that data.\n\n184\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.540\nWhen you plug it in, it's gonna\nprompt you for your encryption key.\n\n185\n00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.420\nAnd you punch that in- [COUGH] And\nit unlocks that drive.\n\n186\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.740\nIt decrypts it, and\nnow it's available to you.\n\n187\n00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.820\nWell, if you do fast user,\n\n188\n00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.120\nswitching over to another user,\nit's unlocked for them too.\n\n189\n00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.810\nBecause when you unlock that thumb drive,\nyou're unlocking it for\n\n190\n00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.550\nthe system to access it,\nnot necessarily your individual user.\n\n191\n00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.260\nAnd so, now your data is not safe.\n\n192\n00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.378\nSo, you've always got to be aware of that.\n\n193\n00:09:36.378 --> 00:09:39.360\nWith removable media, when you plug it in,\n\n194\n00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.220\nyou're giving access to that to all\nof the users that are on that system.\n\n195\n00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.740\n>> Don, we've also had some questions in\nthe past that have come from our users,\n\n196\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.830\nthat ask about how these accounts and\nstuff,\n\n197\n00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.160\nwill affect, let's say for instance,\nyou're attached to Open Directory,\n\n198\n00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.202\nhow does this behavior affect\nan Open Directory based account?\n\n199\n00:09:55.202 --> 00:09:56.640\n>> [LAUGH] It's actually kind of neat,\n\n200\n00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.720\nbecause I'm not bound to\nan Open Directory here.\n\n201\n00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.770\nBut if I were to bind\nto a directory server,\n\n202\n00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.440\nwhether it's Microsoft's Active Directory\nor Apple's Open Directory,\n\n203\n00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.090\neither one,\nit disables fast user switching.\n\n204\n00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.150\nThis doesn't work when you're\nattached to a directory.\n\n205\n00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.440\nSo right now,\nI've got this ability to switch, and\n\n206\n00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.530\nit's because these are local accounts,\nright?\n\n207\n00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.720\nThis type of service, this fast user\nswitching, it's really designed for\n\n208\n00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.540\nhome users.\n\n209\n00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.870\nIt's really designed for\nthat type of environment,\n\n210\n00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.880\nwhere you have shared computers.\n\n211\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.210\nIn businesses,\nwe don't normally have shared computers.\n\n212\n00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.420\nAnd so things like privacy concerns over\nremovable media, we don't have that,\n\n213\n00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.060\nbecause people have a dedicated machine.\n\n214\n00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.730\nAnd so when you bind to a directory\nserver, this stops working.\n\n215\n00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.220\nThis drop-down menu, with the users and\nall that stuff, that just goes away.\n\n216\n00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.740\nAnd that's it, you don't have that access.\n\n217\n00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.270\nSo we don't have to worry about it there.\n\n218\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.010\nYou can look at it from the flip side.\n\n219\n00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.650\nI look at it as,\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n220\n00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.050\nYou could also say,\nwe lose that functionality.\n\n221\n00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.640\nMaybe there's something you want,\nand tough luck, you don't get it.\n\n222\n00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.714\n>> Now I know many of you,\nI know myself, Don I know you have kids,\n\n223\n00:10:55.714 --> 00:10:57.280\nmany of you out there have kids,\n\n224\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.127\nand it is important in today's day in age,\nthat we keep our kids safe, right?\n\n225\n00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:05.418\nSo, we do have a series of parental\ncontrols that you mentioned in the past,\n\n226\n00:11:05.418 --> 00:11:06.433\nkind of in brief.\n\n227\n00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:08.535\nCan you tell us a little bit about\nthose parental controls that we have?\n\n228\n00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:09.075\n>> Absolutely,\n\n229\n00:11:09.075 --> 00:11:12.048\nit's really one of the driving factors\nof having multiple accounts, right?\n\n230\n00:11:12.048 --> 00:11:15.311\nNormally, if I have a laptop and\nit's my home laptop, or a desktop,\n\n231\n00:11:15.311 --> 00:11:19.248\nI just tell my password to my wife, we can\nboth use the computer, it's no big deal,\n\n232\n00:11:19.248 --> 00:11:21.300\nwe just have one account.\n\n233\n00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.620\nBut if you wanna implement\nparental controls,\n\n234\n00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.040\nyou're going to have to have\nmore than one account, right?\n\n235\n00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.000\nBecause you don't wanna have one account\nthat's locked down with parental controls.\n\n236\n00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000\nYou wanna have one that's not locked,\nand then one or more that are.\n\n237\n00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.060\nAnd so that's usually the prime example of\nwhere we've got multiple user accounts,\n\n238\n00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.268\nis you've got your parent,\nand your children.\n\n239\n00:11:39.268 --> 00:11:41.830\nBut you can use it in a school lab,\nwhere you have the teacher's and\n\n240\n00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.860\nthe kids' accounts, or whatever.\n\n241\n00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.310\nYou can use it there.\n\n242\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.930\nYou can apply parental\ncontrols to the guest account.\n\n243\n00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.510\nSo that when somebody logs in with\na guest account, that they'll have that.\n\n244\n00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.180\nThere's different ways that we can use it,\nbut parental controls are a great example.\n\n245\n00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.270\nAnd I know we mentioned parental\ncontrols in another episode, and\n\n246\n00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.790\nI kinda skimmed through them briefly, but\nlet's take a better look at that, right?\n\n247\n00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.110\nSo Wes's account here,\nI've got him logged in, and\n\n248\n00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.500\nhe's just a regular user right now.\n\n249\n00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.030\nSo he can fire up Safari, and\nhe can browse to the Internet.\n\n250\n00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.960\nSo he can get to sites like itpro.tv,\nhe can browse to it, and get to it.\n\n251\n00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.990\nAnd he can go into System Preferences,\nand while he can't change\n\n252\n00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.950\neverything in System Preferences,\nthere are some things he can change.\n\n253\n00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:22.620\nIf he goes to users and groups,\nhe's just a regular user, right?\n\n254\n00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.680\nSo he can't add anybody,\n\n255\n00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.980\nif he hits the unlock button,\nhis password won't work, right?\n\n256\n00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.250\nSo if he tries to unlock\nit with his account, and\n\n257\n00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.220\npunch that in, he's not an admin,\nso it doesn't work.\n\n258\n00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.230\nBut back in system preferences, he can do\nthings like changing the wallpaper, right?\n\n259\n00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.640\nSo if he goes in here and decides hey,\nI don't want that El Capitan wallpaper.\n\n260\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.220\nI want farmlands, right?\n\n261\n00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.450\nSo he can switch it to farmlands, and\nhe can change the screensaver settings,\n\n262\n00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:49.430\nthe power options.\n\n263\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.690\nHe can change that stuff.\n\n264\n00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.170\nHe can also do things like\nshut the computer down, right?\n\n265\n00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.680\nSo if he goes up here\nto his Apple menu and\n\n266\n00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.310\nchooses shut down,\nhe can turn the computer off.\n\n267\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.080\nNow look what he gets.\n\n268\n00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.230\nShutting down may cause other users\nto lose their unsaved changes.\n\n269\n00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.520\nRemember, I'm still logged in.\n\n270\n00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.860\nAnd I've got Safari open.\n\n271\n00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.230\nI've got Text Edit open.\n\n272\n00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.390\nI've got System Preferences.\n\n273\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.810\nIf he shuts the machine down,\nI'm gonna lose my stuff.\n\n274\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.320\nAnd so it's saying,\nare you sure you wanna do that?\n\n275\n00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.380\nAnd if he punches in his credentials,\nif he's an admin,\n\n276\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.570\nit's gonna let him shut it down.\n\n277\n00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.400\nIt's gonna kick me out, right?\n\n278\n00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.190\nBut when he punches that in,\nhe's not an admin.\n\n279\n00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.370\nHe can't kick me out.\n\n280\n00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.410\nSo, there's certain\nlimitations a regular user has.\n\n281\n00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:35.180\nBut parental controls let us go\neven further than that, right?\n\n282\n00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.510\nSo let me, I'm gonna log Wes out, and\nI'm gonna switch back to my account.\n\n283\n00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.890\nSo let me just take him and log out.\n\n284\n00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.530\nAnd once he's logged out,\nI'll log back in as me.\n\n285\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.010\nNow I'm still running in the background.\n\n286\n00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.550\nI've still got my orange check mark, and\nso I expect all of my programs to be there\n\n287\n00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.060\nwaiting for me, and sure enough,\nthere's the Safari browser I had open,\n\n288\n00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.410\nhere's that text document that I\nnever saved, it's just sitting there.\n\n289\n00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.280\nIn fact, I'm not gonna save it.\n\n290\n00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.610\nAnd then here's\nthe System Preferences I was in.\n\n291\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.120\nSo all of my stuff's still\nrunning in the background.\n\n292\n00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.500\nI'm gonna take Wes, and\nI'm gonna turn him into a managed account,\n\n293\n00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.200\nan account with parental controls.\n\n294\n00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.090\nAnd all you have to do is check, enable\nparental controls, right down here, and\n\n295\n00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.860\nhe just changed from a standard user,\nto a managed user.\n\n296\n00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.360\nAnd now, I can configure\nthe parental controls on his account\n\n297\n00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.940\nto restrict the access that he's got.\n\n298\n00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.030\nNow I've got to be an administrator\nto do it, so I'll clear that.\n\n299\n00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.590\nAnd now I can tweak what\nhe's got access to.\n\n300\n00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.040\nAnd in the other episode, I just skimmed\nover this real quick, but for the exam,\n\n301\n00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.390\nwe need to understand what\neach of these options do.\n\n302\n00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:37.330\nWhen you go into Parental Controls\nthere's five tabs, or six,\n\n303\n00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.010\nif I could count, six tabs.\n\n304\n00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.780\nApps, Web, Stores, Time,\nPrivacy, and Other.\n\n305\n00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.520\nAnd each one of these lets us change\nthe behavior of the system for that user.\n\n306\n00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.370\nSo for example, let's just assume\nthat Wes is eight years old, right.\n\n307\n00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.480\nAnd I wanna create a safe\nworking environment for him.\n\n308\n00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.930\nSo, I don't want him to use the camera,\n\n309\n00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.060\nbecause that's where people start doing\nthese little chat programs, or whatever,\n\n310\n00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.990\nand you end up in all sorts of trouble,\nso I'm gonna turn that off.\n\n311\n00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:07.030\nGame Center, now Game Center, it's\ndesigned to let you share your high score\n\n312\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.530\nfor video games and\nconnect with your friends, right?\n\n313\n00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.680\nBut it can also let you connect with other\npeople, and do in game chats and stuff,\n\n314\n00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.080\nthat start to get out of your control.\n\n315\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.220\nSo I'm gonna turn that off too.\n\n316\n00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:23.420\nIt's okay if he plays games, but\nI don't want him to be able to use that.\n\n317\n00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.810\nOr, I can turn on Game Center, but\nI can leave off adding friends.\n\n318\n00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.200\nAnd that way as an administrator, I've got\nto come in and add the friends for him, so\n\n319\n00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.300\nI can pick and choose who he's allowed\nto be friends with on the Internet.\n\n320\n00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.825\nI can limit mail,\nthis is a really cool one.\n\n321\n00:15:37.825 --> 00:15:42.195\nSo maybe I want him to be able to\nsend email to me, and my wife, or\n\n322\n00:15:42.195 --> 00:15:44.095\nhis grandmother, right?\n\n323\n00:15:44.095 --> 00:15:49.370\nI can limit mail, and specify particular\ncontacts that he's allowed to.\n\n324\n00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:55.744\nSo I'll say that he's allowed to email me,\nright?\n\n325\n00:15:55.744 --> 00:15:59.182\nAnd so I can create accounts for that,\nI'd need to go into contacts and\n\n326\n00:15:59.182 --> 00:16:02.170\ncreate them there, and\nspecify who I wanted them to access.\n\n327\n00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:06.363\nAnd if he wants to email somebody else,\nI can say Send request here and\n\n328\n00:16:06.363 --> 00:16:08.693\nI could put in my account or whatever.\n\n329\n00:16:08.693 --> 00:16:12.138\nAnd whenever he tried to email somebody\nthat wasn't in this list right here,\n\n330\n00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:14.200\nit would send me an email to approve it.\n\n331\n00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.110\nSo I now control who\nhe's allowed to email.\n\n332\n00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.020\nI can limit the applications\nthat he can get to.\n\n333\n00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.580\nAnd this is really important.\n\n334\n00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.770\nThink about that mail\nlimitation I just did.\n\n335\n00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.390\nWell, I want him to be able to send email.\n\n336\n00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:32.389\nBut, what's stopping him from\ngoing to yahoo.com or outlook.com,\n\n337\n00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:35.270\ngmail.com and\nsetting up his own email account.\n\n338\n00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.480\nWell, he's eight years old,\nprobably not gonna do it but\n\n339\n00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.780\nhe could figure it out and now he's got\nemail that I don't control anymore.\n\n340\n00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.050\nSo, I might not want him\nto have a web browser.\n\n341\n00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.350\nI can come through and\npick which applications he can run, and\n\n342\n00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:52.450\nyou can specify right here exactly which\nprograms are allowed and aren't allowed.\n\n343\n00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.070\nAnd so, I might want to come in here and\njust turn off Safari outright.\n\n344\n00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.590\nI don't want Wes to be able to run Safari.\n\n345\n00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:58.960\nI can turn that off.\n\n346\n00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.420\nAnd you can pick and choose.\n\n347\n00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.740\nUsually, what you'll do is\nyou'll turn them all off.\n\n348\n00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.170\nAnd then you go through and\nfind the exact ones that you want.\n\n349\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.140\nI don't want him to get to the app store.\n\n350\n00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.260\nOr maybe I'm okay with that.\n\n351\n00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.430\nI would pick it, right?\n\n352\n00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.900\nCalculator's okay, calendar's okay,\nI don't want him running the automator.\n\n353\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.850\nWhat's he going to automate?\n\n354\n00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:16.410\nHe's eight years old.\n\n355\n00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.462\nChess, I'll allow that one.\n\n356\n00:17:18.462 --> 00:17:20.280\nDashboard, right, just kind of picking and\n\n357\n00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.050\nchoosing based on what it is that I'm\nokay with him having access to, right?\n\n358\n00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.240\nFaceTime.\n\n359\n00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.350\nI don't wanna him using FaceTime.\n\n360\n00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.240\nI don't wanna chatting with\npeople on the Internet or\n\n361\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.230\nother friends at school\nwithout my control of it.\n\n362\n00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.720\nSo you go through and you pick and choose\nwhat you think is appropriate for them.\n\n363\n00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.393\nRight, now, notice how some of these,\nwhen I click it,\n\n364\n00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:43.270\nit made some check marks disappear and\nothers appear.\n\n365\n00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.738\nWhat's going on is, the screen is actually\nnot refreshed to reflect that, and so\n\n366\n00:17:46.738 --> 00:17:48.670\nwhen I check it,\nit's kind of refreshing the screen.\n\n367\n00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.200\nBut you basically have to pick and\n\n368\n00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.850\nchoose each of these that you\nwant him to have access to.\n\n369\n00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.150\nNow, on Safari,\nI don't have to turn off Safari outright.\n\n370\n00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.420\nI can leave him with access to Safari.\n\n371\n00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.370\nAnd on the next tab over, I've got Web,\nand I can limit the websites he gets to.\n\n372\n00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.990\nAnd I like this one because you can\nsay only get to these websites.\n\n373\n00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.110\nAnd you can specify, PBS Kids,\nDiscovery Kids, HowStuffWorks.\n\n374\n00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.670\nThese are okay.\n\n375\n00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:12.290\nNothing else.\n\n376\n00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.710\nI'm not gonna add ITProTv, so\nwe'll see that get blocked.\n\n377\n00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.680\n>> The list right there Don\nthat you have opened up.\n\n378\n00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.570\nNow is that a pre-populated list or\n\n379\n00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.270\nis that something that you've already\nset before we start with the show?\n\n380\n00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.410\n>> These are the Apple defaults.\n\n381\n00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.520\nSo Apple puts it,\nyou might not even go agree with these.\n\n382\n00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.590\nYou might say, Disney, I don't like that.\n\n383\n00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:27.140\nLet me take that out.\n\n384\n00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.260\nI don't want him watching\nHannah Montana all day or whatever.\n\n385\n00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.330\nSo you might want to take that one out,\nyou can certainly tweak this\n\n386\n00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.490\nhowever you want,\nthese are just kinda a couple of defaults.\n\n387\n00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:38.550\nOdds are your kids might go to a school\nwhere they use accelerated reader or\n\n388\n00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.520\na program like that, and so you'd want\nto add the accelerated reader website or\n\n389\n00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.640\nthe class dojo or whatever other software\nthey might need for their school.\n\n390\n00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.420\nYou just add them to the list,\nthe point is that you get to pick.\n\n391\n00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.800\nThere is a curated list up here.\n\n392\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.310\nThis try to limit access\nto adult websites and\n\n393\n00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.190\nthat's one where Apple maintains list but\nnotice how it says try.\n\n394\n00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:59.310\nThey know they can't be perfect.\n\n395\n00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:02.130\nThey know that there's new websites coming\nout every single day and they can't\n\n396\n00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:06.820\ncatch them right away, so you can try but\nthis is the only way to be sure.\n\n397\n00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.940\nYou specifically approve websites\nyou want them to be able to get to.\n\n398\n00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.910\nAll right, we've also got stores.\n\n399\n00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.840\nNow, if I have approved\naccess to the App store,\n\n400\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.810\nthere's actually multiple stores inside of\nit, the iTunes store, the iBooks store.\n\n401\n00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.400\nYou can restrict movies, music, TV.\n\n402\n00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.460\nTechnically, they're all kind of their\nown little store inside of iTunes.\n\n403\n00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:31.870\nSo I might want to allow him to get\ninto the iTunes but not allow him to\n\n404\n00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.080\nget to the iBook store or\nthe iTunes store itself.\n\n405\n00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.870\nYou can start to restrict this access and\ncontrol what they can do.\n\n406\n00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.180\nAt a minimum, you'll wanna control\nwhat movies they can get to.\n\n407\n00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:48.470\nSo I might wanna hold them to PG movies\nand TV shows that are TV-Y7 or lower.\n\n408\n00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:53.490\nI might limit apps to only apps that\nare rated Nine and up or four and up.\n\n409\n00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.425\nLet's go even stricter there.\n\n410\n00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:58.240\nLimit books with sexual content,\nyou can really tighten that down.\n\n411\n00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.320\nTime, to me,\n\n412\n00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.650\nis the most important tab here because\na lot of times you have restricted access.\n\n413\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.760\nWe were talking about this before\nthe show and I said for my kids,\n\n414\n00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.770\nif they have Internet access, I only allow\nthem to do that while that laptop is\n\n415\n00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:16.660\nright there in the living room, where\nit's supervised access to the machine.\n\n416\n00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.270\nWell, what if one of them were to get\nup in the middle of the night and\n\n417\n00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.800\nthey come out and they get the laptop and\nthey take it back into their bedroom?\n\n418\n00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.220\nRight, now they've got unsupervised access\nand I don't know, cause I'm asleep.\n\n419\n00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.000\nSo you can come in here and\nyou can limit weekday use,\n\n420\n00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.530\nyou can limit weekend use, you can set up\nbedtime for school nights and weekends.\n\n421\n00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:37.850\nAnd right here you can set the hours\nthey're allowed to use that computer.\n\n422\n00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:41.210\nAnd so I can set it so\nthey're not allowed to use it at night.\n\n423\n00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:45.090\nSo the default here is 11pm to 9am,\nin between that time,\n\n424\n00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.270\nthey're not allowed to use the laptop,\nthey can't, right?\n\n425\n00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.450\nAnd the same thing on the weekends,\nyou can also set a quota for\n\n426\n00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.910\nhow many hours a day.\n\n427\n00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.570\nI don't want him sitting there\nplaying Minecraft ten hours a day.\n\n428\n00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.430\nI can hold it three hours.\n\n429\n00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.112\nAnd he can use it thirty minutes now,\n\n430\n00:20:58.112 --> 00:21:01.640\nthirty minutes later and\nit adds up to three hours across the day.\n\n431\n00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.210\nOr he can burn that three\nhours up all in one sitting.\n\n432\n00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:08.460\nAnd now it logs him out,\ncan't use it again until tomorrow.\n\n433\n00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.180\nAnd he gets another 3 hours the next day.\n\n434\n00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.640\nSo you can set these quotas\nwith restricted access.\n\n435\n00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.220\nAt some point,\nyou've got to get outside and play.\n\n436\n00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.570\n>> Now, those time settings are great.\n\n437\n00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:18.070\nOne of the things, let's say your\nkid's getting a little bit older,\n\n438\n00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.980\ngetting a little more tech savvy and\nsays you know what?\n\n439\n00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.930\nI think I'm going to lock my\nparent out of my account,\n\n440\n00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.120\nbecause you know what I'm gonna do?\n\n441\n00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.070\nI'm going to change the password on them,\nand then they won't know what I'm doing.\n\n442\n00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.210\nNow, can we prevent something like that?\n\n443\n00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.240\nThe restricting password changing and\nstuff?\n\n444\n00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.110\n>> Yes, you actually, you can never\nreally lock somebody out of an account.\n\n445\n00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.260\nSo if the parent of the kid,\nif they change their password,\n\n446\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.000\nall the parent has to do is go in Users\nand Groups and reset the password.\n\n447\n00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.820\nSo there's not really, you don't\nnormally feel the need to restrict that.\n\n448\n00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.510\nBut you do have those options.\n\n449\n00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.480\nYou know, as we kind of poke\naround in some of these settings,\n\n450\n00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.930\nI believe somewhere in here we've got\nwhere you can turn off the password.\n\n451\n00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.780\nI know we can do it with a configuration\nprofile in the profile manager.\n\n452\n00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.850\nBut we might not have specifically\nhave that setting right in here.\n\n453\n00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:01.140\nI'm just kinda glancing around.\n\n454\n00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.040\nYeah, I don't see one.\n\n455\n00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.220\nBut you do have a lot of stuff, but\nyou can never truly lock that parent out.\n\n456\n00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.350\nParent can always reset the child's\npassword, that's an easy one.\n\n457\n00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.410\n>> All right.\nI'm going to play devil's advocate on this\n\n458\n00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:17.440\none, Don, and say what if my son\naccidentally found out how to print and\n\n459\n00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.860\ndecided to print an 800 page document and\nnow I'm out of toner and stuff?\n\n460\n00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:26.050\nCould we restrict things like the ability\nto send information to printers at all?\n\n461\n00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:26.830\nYou can control.\n\n462\n00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.270\nWell, if they're not an administrator,\n\n463\n00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.890\nthen they won't be able to add the\nprinter, so you kind of have that control.\n\n464\n00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.040\nAnd then you can always set\npermissions on the printer.\n\n465\n00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.230\nSo you can say they're not\nallowed to use the printer.\n\n466\n00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.430\nAnd if they wanna print something,\nyou've gotta do it for them.\n\n467\n00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.340\nSo you've got access for that, too.\n\n468\n00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:43.530\nThere's a few things you can do that start\nto get a little more complex, right?\n\n469\n00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.300\nThe ones here in the parental\ncontrols are pretty easy cuz we've\n\n470\n00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.000\ngot them all right here.\n\n471\n00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.410\nYou can just flip them and set them.\n\n472\n00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:48.130\nThe other ones you really\n\n473\n00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.160\nstart getting into more of\nthe network administration side.\n\n474\n00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.110\nAnd that's where you really need\nyour profile manager for those.\n\n475\n00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.380\nAll right, if we take a look at privacy,\nright here you'll see whether they're\n\n476\n00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.340\nallowed to change certain things like\nwhether they can change Twitter and\n\n477\n00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.760\nFacebook settings.\n\n478\n00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.290\nI might not want to allow them to add\na Twitter or Facebook account, so\n\n479\n00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:06.010\nI can turn these off and\nsay they're not allowed to do it.\n\n480\n00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.950\nYou can also set privacy settings on their\naccount, again turning those things off.\n\n481\n00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:11.690\nNot letting people see when\nthey're online and so on.\n\n482\n00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.350\nAnd then the other tab.\n\n483\n00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.250\nHere's where we can tweak things\nlike what Wes was saying, you know?\n\n484\n00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.490\nDisable editing of printers and scanners.\n\n485\n00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.490\nWell, that's not controlling\nwhether they can print to it.\n\n486\n00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.530\nBut it stops them from changing\nthe printer or modifying it.\n\n487\n00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.720\nWe can block CD and DVD access.\n\n488\n00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.720\nThat's important.\n\n489\n00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.360\nWe can prevent the dock\nfrom being modified.\n\n490\n00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.160\nWe can use a simple finder.\n\n491\n00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.160\nI don't want them browsing\nall over the hard drive.\n\n492\n00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.570\nI can limit them just to what\nthey see in their own folder.\n\n493\n00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.030\nWe can kinda restrict that down.\n\n494\n00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:43.090\nYou got a ton of neat little options in\nhere that make that stuff a lot easier for\n\n495\n00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.660\nus, all right?\n\n496\n00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:48.850\nOnce all that stuff is in place,\nwe've now got Wes locked down pretty well.\n\n497\n00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.590\nAnd if I had other children,\nI could add accounts for them and\n\n498\n00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.770\ngive them different restrictions.\n\n499\n00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:56.113\nSo I might have tighter restrictions\non one versus another because maybe\n\n500\n00:23:56.113 --> 00:23:57.880\none of them is older and knows better.\n\n501\n00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.396\nAnd so I give them a little more freedom,\nit's up to me to set that.\n\n502\n00:24:01.396 --> 00:24:03.555\nNow if I switch over to Wes's account.\n\n503\n00:24:03.555 --> 00:24:04.948\nLet me just jump over to him.\n\n504\n00:24:04.948 --> 00:24:07.735\nHis user experience is gonna\nbe much different now.\n\n505\n00:24:07.735 --> 00:24:12.360\nWhen he logs in, all those parental\ncontrols are going to start applying.\n\n506\n00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.480\nSo see how it's taking a moment to log in?\n\n507\n00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.870\nIt’s updating to reflect that.\n\n508\n00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:19.170\nAnd you’ll notice right away\nthat my dock is very different.\n\n509\n00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.150\nI restricted the applications he can get\nto, so most of the applications are gone.\n\n510\n00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:27.540\nAnd it's giving me a simplified\ndoc where I see my applications,\n\n511\n00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.170\nmy documents and shared and that's it.\n\n512\n00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.150\nI don't have a full binder experience.\n\n513\n00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:36.690\nAnd to see how it's popping me, it's\ntrying to launch my vmwear application.\n\n514\n00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.130\nHe's not allowed to run that.\n\n515\n00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.610\nSo, if I want to allow it as a parent,\nI can combine, I can say allow once.\n\n516\n00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.750\nI'm going to allow it just this one time.\n\n517\n00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.790\nOr I can say Always Allow to\ngreen light this program.\n\n518\n00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:47.930\nHe can now run it.\n\n519\n00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.010\nI'll allow this one cuz we kind of\nneed it in the virtual machine.\n\n520\n00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:53.890\nBut you're more than likely\nnot running that one.\n\n521\n00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.500\nMy goodness,\nis it gonna prompt me multiple times?\n\n522\n00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:01.110\nThe little VMWare Daemon, it'll try and\nre-run itself if it fails, so\n\n523\n00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.840\nit tried to run twice.\n\n524\n00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.940\nSo there we go, so now he's in.\n\n525\n00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.729\nAnd if he fires up the Finder to browse\non the hard drive, what happens?\n\n526\n00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.170\nIt just kind of sits there.\n\n527\n00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.160\nIt's the simplified finder.\n\n528\n00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.340\nHe's got everything he needs right here,\n\n529\n00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.150\nthe three folders I want\nhim to have access to.\n\n530\n00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.610\nAnd if he goes to My Applications,\n\n531\n00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.190\nhe's only seeing the ones that\nI checked off earlier, right?\n\n532\n00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:21.910\nThe others are all hidden.\n\n533\n00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:22.440\nThey're all gone.\n\n534\n00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.700\nI didn't check the other ones.\n\n535\n00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.440\nAnd remember I said my screen\nwasn't refreshing, and\n\n536\n00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.880\nwe saw all those check marks?\n\n537\n00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.310\nI can see that is the case.\n\n538\n00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.170\nAll those other ones aren't showing up.\n\n539\n00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:30.910\nThey weren't checked.\n\n540\n00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:36.430\nAnd if I fire up my Safari,\nhe's got access to Safari.\n\n541\n00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.090\nAnd here's those Apple websites\nthat were added in, and\n\n542\n00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.800\nsee how Disney is gone from that list,\nright?\n\n543\n00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.290\nIt's giving him the screen of\nthe approved websites that he can get to,\n\n544\n00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:47.890\nand that's it.\n\n545\n00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:52.570\nIf he tries and goes to another site,\nlike ItProTV, it's restricted.\n\n546\n00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:53.260\nOops!\n\n547\n00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.490\nYou can't see pages on this website.\n\n548\n00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.080\nIf we're the parent, he can come over and\n\n549\n00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.730\nsay hey Don, I really need to get\nto this website, can you add it?\n\n550\n00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:05.320\nI can hit Add Website, and I can authorize\nit, and that's gonna add it to that list,\n\n551\n00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.840\nand now he'll be able to get to\nthat website once it's added.\n\n552\n00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.100\nSo the next time he tries to go to it,\nIt's gonna run it against that list and\n\n553\n00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.690\nthis time it'll be approved.\n\n554\n00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.500\nNow where it gets a little tricky is\nsome websites actually link to multiple\n\n555\n00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.300\nservers on the back end.\n\n556\n00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.390\nAnd so you might have to fiddle around\nwith it a bit before you get it fully\n\n557\n00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.100\napproved.\n\n558\n00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:25.240\nBut otherwise, once you're in,\nyou're at that site.\n\n559\n00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.390\nAnd so he's able to get in here, work with\nit, do whatever it is that he needs to do.\n\n560\n00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.760\nAnd when he's done you just close out.\n\n561\n00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.670\nSo now it's a much more safe,\ncontrolled environment.\n\n562\n00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.170\nAnd so this is one of the best\nexamples of where we use\n\n563\n00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.790\nmultiple user accounts, right?\n\n564\n00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.240\nSo I can come up to the computer and\n\n565\n00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.570\nI can switch back to me, and\nnow I've got full access to the system,\n\n566\n00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:48.690\nI can do whatever I need, and then he can\nswitch over to his account and use it.\n\n567\n00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.320\nBut what happens if I'm logged in,\n\n568\n00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.050\nI'm working and\nthen I walk away to take a bathroom break?\n\n569\n00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:57.210\nIf I leave the computer unlocked\nthey can still sit down and use it.\n\n570\n00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.070\nSo it's not a perfect system.\n\n571\n00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.550\nYou've gotta remember\nwhen you're not using\n\n572\n00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:01.850\nthe computer that you need to log out.\n\n573\n00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.540\nOr at least lock the screen or whatever.\n\n574\n00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.490\nAnd you can do that by\nchoosing your username And\n\n575\n00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.030\nhitting the Login Window button.\n\n576\n00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.170\nAnd when you do that it takes\nyou to the Login Window,\n\n577\n00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:14.310\nyour stuff is still running but\nnow they can log in and use the system.\n\n578\n00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.700\nYou can lock the screen, let me just show\nyou real quick because I know one thing\n\n579\n00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:23.500\nthat I recommend in another episode is\nI normally take Keychain Access and\n\n580\n00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:27.920\nI set Keychain Access to always\nshow up in the menu bar.\n\n581\n00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.490\nAnd that way,\nwhen I'm using the computer and\n\n582\n00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:33.820\nI'm about to take a break, I just hit this\nlittle lock and I choose Lock the Screen.\n\n583\n00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:38.520\nRight, well if I do that and\nI lock the screen, what's gonna happen?\n\n584\n00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.060\nWell, it's not locking it.\n\n585\n00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.530\nAll right,\nwhy isn't it locking the screen?\n\n586\n00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:45.350\nIf I were to lock the screen like normal,\n\n587\n00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:49.580\nit would be locked and\nonly I could unlock it.\n\n588\n00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.430\nWes couldn't unlock it.\n\n589\n00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.440\nAll the other people who have accounts\ncouldn't come and use the system and so\n\n590\n00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.090\nwe don't want to use that.\n\n591\n00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:58.950\nInstead, we want to make sure that\nwe return to the login window.\n\n592\n00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.770\nIt's like locking the screen except\nmore than one person can use it and\n\n593\n00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.740\nthose other people will log\nin with their own account.\n\n594\n00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.320\n>> A lot of great information\nthat we've seen in this episode.\n\n595\n00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.660\nBut it does look like we are coming\nto the end of the time that we have.\n\n596\n00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.910\nDon, got anything else?\n\n597\n00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.070\n>> That's about it on parental controls.\n\n598\n00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.070\nI know we kinda covered it twice but\nthis is much more in depth.\n\n599\n00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.950\nOn the exam they expect you\nto know what each of those.\n\n600\n00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:18.750\nTabs are and what they do.\n\n601\n00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:22.020\nWe do have a little bit more on user\naccounts, but as far as this side,\n\n602\n00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.360\nI think we're pretty much wrapped up.\n\n603\n00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.110\n>> All right, very good.\n\n604\n00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.060\nThen what we're gonna do is go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n605\n00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.260\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n606\n00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.270\n>> And I'm Don Pizzette.\n\n607\n00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.325\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n608\n00:28:29.325 --> 00:28:38.020\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:20.000\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're going to be moving along\n\n4\n00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.270\nour Apple Certified Support Professional\nand\n\n5\n00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.890\ntoday we've got none other than our\nin house Mac expert, Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.950\nHow ya doing Don?\n\n7\n00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.890\n>> I'm doing great Wes,\nglad to be back on the show and\n\n8\n00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.430\nI know what you're thinking,\nanother episode on user accounts.\n\n9\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.610\nWe're just kinda beating\na dead horse here.\n\n10\n00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.560\nWell, this is the last one, I promise but\nthis is also a very important one.\n\n11\n00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.710\nIn this episode we're gonna take\na look at user account security.\n\n12\n00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.740\nHow we keep those accounts secure,\neven if you only have\n\n13\n00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.570\none account you still need to keep\nit secure, as well as your computer.\n\n14\n00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.660\nBut if you have more than one account it's\neven more important that we do that, so\n\n15\n00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.890\nthat's what we're going to be\njumping through in this episode.\n\n16\n00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.290\n>> And one of the first things that\nwe always look at when it comes to\n\n17\n00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.210\nuser account security, Don I'm gonna have\nto search probably the password, right?\n\n18\n00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.440\n>> Yeah.\nYou know\n\n19\n00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.210\nin Mac OS you don't have\nto have a password.\n\n20\n00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.460\nYou could leave it blank if you wanted.\n\n21\n00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.510\nYou could even set your\ncomputer to auto log on so\n\n22\n00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.010\nthat when you turn the computer on it just\ngoes right in and you're ready to go.\n\n23\n00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.770\nAnd that's pretty darn convenient,\nisn't it?\n\n24\n00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.350\nBut let's say you have a MacBook and\nyou're at the airport, and\n\n25\n00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.280\nyou set it down and somebody steals it.\n\n26\n00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.010\nWell now, they can take it home,\nturn it on, it logs right in, and\n\n27\n00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.700\nthey can get right at your data.\n\n28\n00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.660\nThat's not good.\n\n29\n00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.440\nSo we want to have a password.\n\n30\n00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.450\nWe don't want to use automatic log in.\n\n31\n00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.370\nWe want to make sure we take some basic\nsteps to keep our system secure and,\n\n32\n00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.090\na password is the first step, right.\n\n33\n00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.970\nWell, let's take a look at those settings\nhere in our Mac OS El Capitan and\n\n34\n00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.980\nget a chance to see how\nthose are configured.\n\n35\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.090\nIf I jump into my system preferences,\nwhen we create a user account, actually,\n\n36\n00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.720\nwhen we turn the computer on for the first\ntime, it runs the Setup Assistant.\n\n37\n00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.510\nAnd the Setup Assistant asks us to pick\na default user name for us to use.\n\n38\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.520\nAnd it asks for a password but\nthe password is optional.\n\n39\n00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.390\nSo if you haven't set a password for\nyourself, then you can just go here into\n\n40\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.810\nUsers & Groups, and inside Users &\nGroups you can choose your account.\n\n41\n00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.920\nAnd you've got change password right here.\n\n42\n00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.140\nYou can hit that button and\n\n43\n00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.740\nyou can change your password\nto whatever you want it to be.\n\n44\n00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.380\nYou can put in your, well you have\nto put in your old password and\n\n45\n00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.850\nthen you put in what your\nnew password is going to be.\n\n46\n00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.040\nAnd if you can't come up with a good one,\nright, so maybe I'm just having a hard\n\n47\n00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.230\ntime coming up with whatever\nI want my new password to be.\n\n48\n00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.870\nI can use the password\nassistant right here and\n\n49\n00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.920\nwhen I click on that, it’s gonna give\nme some suggested passwords to use.\n\n50\n00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.340\nLike it’s here it's suggesting,\ncoon78(least,\n\n51\n00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.150\nthat’s not necessarily\nthe greatest password, is it?\n\n52\n00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.730\nWe'll drop it down and\nlook at some of the other ones,\n\n53\n00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.720\nwe got, dash65]caved, and so on.\n\n54\n00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.590\nIt’s trying to create complex\npasswords that are easy to remember,\n\n55\n00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.800\nright, busy3#majors.\n\n56\n00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.680\nIt's pretty easy to remember.\n\n57\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.550\nSo I could pick one like that,\nand now I've got a nice,\n\n58\n00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.840\ngood password that's easy for\nme to remember, and I can log in, right?\n\n59\n00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.570\nAnd it's even showing me my\nentropy score and stuff so\n\n60\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.270\nI get an idea of how\nsecure this password is.\n\n61\n00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.760\nAnd you can do little\nthings to improve it.\n\n62\n00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.550\nSee how when I added an exclamation point\nI got a, the green bar keeps going up and\n\n63\n00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.730\nup and up and up and up.\n\n64\n00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.460\nI'm making it more and\nmore difficult to guess.\n\n65\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.420\nNot really with all those\nexclamation points.\n\n66\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.150\nBut you can kinda pick that password.\n\n67\n00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.590\nAnd once it's done,\nI can say busy3#majors, I gotta try and\n\n68\n00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.670\nremember this password, busy3#majors.\n\n69\n00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.450\nIn fact, I'm just gonna copy it.\n\n70\n00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.690\nSo [LAUGH] we can do that.\n\n71\n00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.620\nAnd then I can specify it.\n\n72\n00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.660\nIt's already got it put in here for\nme and I can hit Change Password and\n\n73\n00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.290\nI've now got a new password on my account.\n\n74\n00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.650\nIf I didn't have one before,\nI have it now.\n\n75\n00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.640\nIf I did have one before,\nit's now been changed, all right.\n\n76\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.450\nAnother thing is under login options\nthat's where we have the automatic\n\n77\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.610\nlogin option.\n\n78\n00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.705\nAnd I'm gonna unlock this so I can change\nit, and oop, I've got a new password,\n\n79\n00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:51.440\nbusy3#majors, there we go.\n\n80\n00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.110\nAnd so I can come in here and\nI can choose whether or\n\n81\n00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.150\nnot I want to allow automatic logon.\n\n82\n00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.290\nYou don't want it is basically\nthe short story, you want it off.\n\n83\n00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.030\nBut if it's turned on,\nyou'll see your name in the list.\n\n84\n00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.560\nAnd when I turn the computer on,\nit'll now automatically login as me,\n\n85\n00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.470\nand now, people don't even need\na password to access the system.\n\n86\n00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.780\nThat's not good, right?\n\n87\n00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.210\nSo, I want to make sure that's turned\noff and then I don't have that set.\n\n88\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.040\nThat way, people always have to provide\na password when the computer powers off.\n\n89\n00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.700\nNow, here's the thing.\n\n90\n00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.580\nWhen I create this password,\nit's tied to my account.\n\n91\n00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.410\nI can log in and I can use it.\n\n92\n00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.080\nIt can get tied to other things, too.\n\n93\n00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.750\nSo for example,\nevery user has what's called a keychain.\n\n94\n00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.820\nAnd the keychain stores their passwords.\n\n95\n00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.420\nIt's like a database.\n\n96\n00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.830\nAnd if all your passwords are stored in\nthat database, that's pretty sensitive.\n\n97\n00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.130\nIf somebody gets a hold of that database,\nthey've got all of my passwords.\n\n98\n00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.220\nAnd any time I browse to a website and\nI login or I access some resource and\n\n99\n00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.660\nI login, Safari will prompt to\nsave the password for me and\n\n100\n00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.600\nsave it in my keychain.\n\n101\n00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.890\nThat keychain we can look at it,\nthe application is called keychain Access,\n\n102\n00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.320\nand when you go into keychain access\nyou'll see things that it's been saving.\n\n103\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.000\nLike your Apple IDs if you've got one,\nyour encryption key and so on.\n\n104\n00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.570\nI'm logged into the Apple app store and\nwhen I did that, it saved it right,\n\n105\n00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.670\nwhere is it, right here, My Apple IDs.\n\n106\n00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.030\nIt saved it right here into the keychain\nso that I've got that access.\n\n107\n00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.900\nSo that the next time I launch it I\ndon't have to put in my password again.\n\n108\n00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.670\nWell, this key chain is secured\nwith a password, too, and\n\n109\n00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.900\nby default the password matches\nyour user account password.\n\n110\n00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.714\nSo, one thing we have to remember is\nthat if we ever change our password,\n\n111\n00:05:36.714 --> 00:05:38.690\nthe keychain's gonna break.\n\n112\n00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.390\nWell, the system will prompt you\nto change that password too.\n\n113\n00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.890\nAnd so, the next time I reboot,\n\n114\n00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.690\nI probably ask me to change my keychain\npassword not to put in my old password and\n\n115\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.300\nthen putting a new password to\nthat cleared and get into it.\n\n116\n00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.780\n>> Now, that database, Don, looks like it\nwould be very, very sensitive information.\n\n117\n00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.820\nObviously, you've got to keep it secure.\n\n118\n00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.400\nIs this gonna be stored\nat plain text on the-\n\n119\n00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.520\n>> No, the database is encrypted and\n\n120\n00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.630\nyour password is actually\nthe encryption key for it,\n\n121\n00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.730\nthat's why you have to have\na password to get into it.\n\n122\n00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.010\nSo if somebody were to get a hold\nof this database, it's useless for\n\n123\n00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.760\nthem unless they have my password.\n\n124\n00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.100\nNow, if I picked a bad password,\nthey might be able to guess it and\n\n125\n00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.810\nget into it, right?\n\n126\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.000\nThat wouldn't be good but because the\ndatabase was encrypted with one password,\n\n127\n00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.570\nwhen I change my password it's no\nlonger good to decrypt that database.\n\n128\n00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.750\nSo, when Keychain asks me to change the\npassword, it's actually got to re-encrypt\n\n129\n00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.440\nthe whole database using the new key,\nand all that happens behind the scenes.\n\n130\n00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.140\nWe don't normally have to worry about it.\n\n131\n00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.880\nThe one time we do have to\n\n132\n00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.970\nworry about it is if we have\nmultiple user accounts, right?\n\n133\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.370\nSo, like if I go into\nSystem Preferences here, and\n\n134\n00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.100\nI'll create a new account,\nmaybe I'll create one for Wes, right?\n\n135\n00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.510\nSo, I'm gonna add an account for him.\n\n136\n00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:48.830\nNow, maybe I can't remember I changed my\npassword, so maybe I create an account for\n\n137\n00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:54.020\nWes and one day he comes up to me and\nsays Don, I forgot my password.\n\n138\n00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.030\nI can't remember what it is and\ncan you reset it for me?\n\n139\n00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.130\nWell, if one of our users forgets\ntheir password it's no big deal.\n\n140\n00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.730\nWe just come into Users & Groups, we pick\nthe user and we hit reset their password.\n\n141\n00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.920\nI can reset Wes' password and see what\nit doesn't ask me for the old password.\n\n142\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.750\nIt's cuz I don't know it.\n\n143\n00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.520\nIt's Wes' password not mine.\n\n144\n00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.280\nBut, I'm an admin so\nI'm allowed to reset his password.\n\n145\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.980\nAn administrator can reset\nanybody else's password.\n\n146\n00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.980\nSo I can give him a new\npassword right here and\n\n147\n00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.050\nnow when he logs in,\nhe knows what the password is.\n\n148\n00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.250\nI can say, hey Wes,\nyour new password is password one, two,\n\n149\n00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.780\nthree, you can go ahead and get logged in,\nand now you know what your password is.\n\n150\n00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.810\nBut once you're in, it's still not done,\nthere's still a little bit more to it.\n\n151\n00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.600\n>> Now Don, I know you've been\nan administrator for many years,\n\n152\n00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.570\nand one of the things that we always\nsay is that administrators don't\n\n153\n00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.410\nneed your password because\nof what you're showing us.\n\n154\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.241\nThey can reset the passwords.\n\n155\n00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:47.713\nWould it be be advisable or\nis there a setting that you can say well,\n\n156\n00:07:47.713 --> 00:07:51.619\nnow that you got that generic,\nlet's say P-A-S-S-1-2-3-4,\n\n157\n00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:53.541\nyou have to change it when you log in?\n\n158\n00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:55.123\nCan we do anything like that here or\n\n159\n00:07:55.123 --> 00:07:57.373\nis that just pretty much\nup to the user to do that?\n\n160\n00:07:57.373 --> 00:08:00.647\nYou know for this there really\nisn't a good way to do that Wes.\n\n161\n00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.440\nWhen you have a directory account yes.\n\n162\n00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.719\nSo if you've got Open Directory or\n\n163\n00:08:03.719 --> 00:08:06.280\nMicrosoft Active Directory you can\ntell those directory accounts,\n\n164\n00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.940\nyeah you need to change your\npassword the next time you log in.\n\n165\n00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.200\nBut here if I reset your password,\n\n166\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.500\nthere's no option here that says\nmake you change it next time.\n\n167\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.020\nAnd if I take a look at your account,\nI don't even see it here, right.\n\n168\n00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.289\nI can make you an admin,\nI can turn on parental controls,\n\n169\n00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:21.772\nI don't have anything crazy there.\n\n170\n00:08:21.772 --> 00:08:25.627\nBut if I right-click on you and\ngo to Advanced Options,\n\n171\n00:08:25.627 --> 00:08:27.760\nwe can see a little bit more.\n\n172\n00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.560\nBut even in here,\nwhere I'm seeing your account and\n\n173\n00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.300\nyour UNIX data kind of behind the scenes,\n\n174\n00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.940\nthere's still not anything in here that's\nreally gonna let me force that change.\n\n175\n00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.970\nSo I don't have a good way to force\nyou to change to a secure password for\n\n176\n00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:40.780\na local account.\n\n177\n00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.795\nFor a directory account,\nyes you absolutely can.\n\n178\n00:08:42.795 --> 00:08:44.070\nFor a local account, not so much.\n\n179\n00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:47.308\n>> So if you were in say like a SOHO\nenvironment, that might be something that\n\n180\n00:08:47.308 --> 00:08:50.089\nthe admin, just experienced based\non what they know with Mac.\n\n181\n00:08:50.089 --> 00:08:52.742\nThey might have to just take that into\nconsideration when they're resetting\n\n182\n00:08:52.742 --> 00:08:53.660\na user's password.\n\n183\n00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.970\n>> Absolutely, yeah,\non a local account like this.\n\n184\n00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.370\nSo it's easy to reset that account,\neasy to get people back into it.\n\n185\n00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.430\nNotice when I reset Wes's password, it\ndoes give me a warning by that keychain.\n\n186\n00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.590\nSee how it says, to reset the password for\n\n187\n00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.630\nthe login keychain, use keychain access\nlocated in the utilities folder.\n\n188\n00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.300\nIt's telling me I'm gonna\nreset the password for\n\n189\n00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.340\nhis account, not his keychain.\n\n190\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.811\nAnd so when he logs in,\nhe won't be able to access his keychain.\n\n191\n00:09:16.811 --> 00:09:20.512\nIt'll actually prompt in, and\nhe'll have to put in his old password and\n\n192\n00:09:20.512 --> 00:09:22.040\nthen put in his new password.\n\n193\n00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.560\nNow what if he doesn't\nknow the old password?\n\n194\n00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.393\nAll right,\nif he doesn't know his old password,\n\n195\n00:09:27.393 --> 00:09:30.031\nhow can he reset the password\non his keychain?\n\n196\n00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:33.244\nAnd the short answer is he can't,\na regular user cannot force a change\n\n197\n00:09:33.244 --> 00:09:36.940\nto the password on their keychain\nunless they know the original password.\n\n198\n00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.588\nCuz otherwise an attacker could\nget that database and say, let me\n\n199\n00:09:39.588 --> 00:09:42.925\njust reset my password, and there you go\nright, all the securities out the window.\n\n200\n00:09:42.925 --> 00:09:48.030\nAn administrator actually has\na special recovery key and\n\n201\n00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.240\nthey can force that to happen.\n\n202\n00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.560\nWe can force a reset of that keychain.\n\n203\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.490\nTechnically, if you're an admin,\n\n204\n00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.320\nyou can access the keychain of\nother users on your system.\n\n205\n00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.440\nYou're not supposed to, cuz it kind of\nforces some changes on the back end, but\n\n206\n00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.560\nit can be done.\n\n207\n00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.780\nSo that security only goes so far when\nit comes to having local accounts.\n\n208\n00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.800\nBut there we do have that limitation.\n\n209\n00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.010\nNow where things here really tricky is a,\nI'm talking about Wes's account and\n\n210\n00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.280\nyou know some other account.\n\n211\n00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.840\nAs long as I have valid admin\naccount that I can log in as\n\n212\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.650\nI can reset that password and\nI'm gonna be okay, all right.\n\n213\n00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:23.200\nBut if I don't have another valid account,\nright, let's just say I don't have\n\n214\n00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.700\nanything else for me to be able to use, so\nI, let me just get rid of Wes' account.\n\n215\n00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.570\nSo let's just pretend we don't have\nWes' account, I'm the only user,\n\n216\n00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:38.410\njust this Don Pezet account and\nI forget my password, what do we do then?\n\n217\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.860\nI can't go to another admin and say can\nyou log in and reset my password for me?\n\n218\n00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.790\nI don't remember my password,\nI can't log in on the computer.\n\n219\n00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:49.230\nWell, we can actually reset\nour password in recovery mode.\n\n220\n00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.380\nSo have you show your Mac down and\nyou boot up in the recovery mode,\n\n221\n00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.120\nonce you're booted in the recovery\nyou'll be able to reset that password.\n\n222\n00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.380\nAnd you know, it's not the super\nconvenient thing to do, like,\n\n223\n00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.680\nI have to put in recovery,\nthat's kind of lame.\n\n224\n00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.980\nBut at least you get there and\nthen you can reset that password.\n\n225\n00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.310\nSo, typically you only have to use this\nif it's the admin that's locked out.\n\n226\n00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:14.640\nIf it's a regular user, just log in\nas admin, and reset the password.\n\n227\n00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.400\nBut if it's the administrator,\nnow we've got trouble.\n\n228\n00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.400\nSo we can boot into recovery and\nwe can get kinda past that.\n\n229\n00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.650\nSo let me show you, I'm gonna take\nthis Mac and boot it into recovery.\n\n230\n00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.570\nNow remember to get in to recovery,\nwhat you're gonna do is your gonna\n\n231\n00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.220\npower on the Mac, and\nyou're gonna hold Cmd-R while you boot.\n\n232\n00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.350\nYou can hold Cmd-R or\nyou can actually hold the Option button.\n\n233\n00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.490\nAnd you'll see all your hard drives, and\n\n234\n00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.610\nyou can pick the recovery\ndrive out of there.\n\n235\n00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.926\nUnless you don't have a recovery drive\nthen you need to go to the Cmd-R route or\n\n236\n00:11:41.926 --> 00:11:44.390\nthe Cmd-Option route and\ndo internet recovery.\n\n237\n00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.950\nBut one way or another,\nyou need to reboot into recover.\n\n238\n00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.990\nAnd once you're in recovery, we can\nuse the password reset utility, right?\n\n239\n00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.020\nSo, I'm booted up into recovery right\nhere, so I can see it on this system.\n\n240\n00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.794\nAnd when you boot up,\nyou get the normal options,\n\n241\n00:11:56.794 --> 00:12:00.750\nthe whole restore from time machine\nbackup, reinstall OS X and so on.\n\n242\n00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.100\nThat's not what I want to do.\n\n243\n00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:06.610\nUp top if I go to utilities,\nthere's a utility in here called terminal.\n\n244\n00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:11.230\nAnd the terminal will let us\ndrop down to what's basically\n\n245\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.720\na Unix shell to run commands that\ngo beyond what these utilities are.\n\n246\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.980\nSo there we go.\n\n247\n00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:21.570\nAnd once I get into the terminal I'm gonna\nrun a utility called Reset Password.\n\n248\n00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.140\nSo just type resetpassword,\nlike than, and run it.\n\n249\n00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.020\nNow it looks like nothing happened,\nbut what's actually going on is,\n\n250\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.200\nit's launching a graphical utility.\n\n251\n00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.920\nAnd because I made my window so\nbig it's probably in the background.\n\n252\n00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.500\nLet's see, there it is, all right.\n\n253\n00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.940\nSo here it is,\nit's launched the password reset utility.\n\n254\n00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.200\nIt's not on the menu,\nit's kinda just from the command line.\n\n255\n00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.560\nYou gotta spawn it that way.\n\n256\n00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.770\nBut once you go in here,\nyou can pick your hard drive and\n\n257\n00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.050\nit will give you a list\nof the user accounts.\n\n258\n00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.120\nAnd so I can see right here,\nthere that Don Pezet account.\n\n259\n00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.580\nAnd its an administrator, but\n\n260\n00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:57.640\nI can see it and I can punch in\na new password for that account.\n\n261\n00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.250\nAnd so I'm going to punch in\na new password for that account.\n\n262\n00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:05.430\nAnd then I can set a password hint,\nin case I don't remember.\n\n263\n00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.570\nAnd then we can save it,\nnow that's gonna reset my password.\n\n264\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:12.160\nAnd notice right down here,\nI can also reset home folder permissions.\n\n265\n00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.600\nThat would only be if I've\nchanged file permissions and\n\n266\n00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.130\nsomehow locked myself out of a folder.\n\n267\n00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:19.240\nI can reset those permissions so now I'll\nbe able to log in and get that access.\n\n268\n00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.090\nThat doesn't normally happen, and\nDisk Utility will fix that too,\n\n269\n00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.340\nwhen you run Disk Utilities First Aid.\n\n270\n00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.570\nSo I'm gonna save that and\nthat's gonna reset my password.\n\n271\n00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.560\nNow remember I changed my password to,\nactually I forgot.\n\n272\n00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.500\nIt's something pound three majors,\nwhatever it was.\n\n273\n00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.620\nSo I just reset it and\nI reset it to password123.\n\n274\n00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.450\nSo now I should be able to log in and\nmy password will be password123.\n\n275\n00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.650\nBut what about my keychain?\n\n276\n00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.130\nMy password is not changed for\n\n277\n00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.170\nthe keychain,\nit's still going to be the old password.\n\n278\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.800\nSo I'm going to have to log\nin with that old password\n\n279\n00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.270\nwhen keychain prompts me\nto be able to get into it.\n\n280\n00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.894\nIf not,\nI won't be able to get into my keychain,\n\n281\n00:13:54.894 --> 00:13:57.655\nand it'll just say,\nlet's create an all new one.\n\n282\n00:13:57.655 --> 00:14:00.370\nIt'll create a new keychain,\nand now as I log into sites and\n\n283\n00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.320\nstuff, it'll start saving and\npopulating that data.\n\n284\n00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.596\nBut it can't decrypt the old\none without the password,\n\n285\n00:14:05.596 --> 00:14:07.443\nbecause that's the security of it, right?\n\n286\n00:14:07.443 --> 00:14:09.766\nWe don't want people to have\naccess to that password.\n\n287\n00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:12.470\nSo I'm gonna enter a new,\nI already did it, right.\n\n288\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.280\nDid I already do it?\n\n289\n00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.880\nI can't remember now,\nso I'll reset it again.\n\n290\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.150\nSo I'm gonna punch in a new password for\nme.\n\n291\n00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.828\nIt's password123, I'm going super secure.\n\n292\n00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:24.292\nSo there it's telling me\nthat my password was reset,\n\n293\n00:14:24.292 --> 00:14:28.252\nthe user's default keychain password\nwasn't changed, so there's that warning.\n\n294\n00:14:28.252 --> 00:14:30.769\nAnd if it's different from\nthe password that I just set,\n\n295\n00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:32.840\nwe will be asked to put in that password.\n\n296\n00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.550\nIf we can't, the keychain is locked and\nwe'll have to create a new one, all right?\n\n297\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:41.170\nAnd so I'll just say okay to that, and\nnow I can boot back into Mac OS and\n\n298\n00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:41.710\nI'll be in business.\n\n299\n00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.360\nNow before I do that, there's one\nmore thing I wanna point out in here.\n\n300\n00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.990\nYou might be thinking to yourself right\nnow, ooh, somebody could steal my laptop.\n\n301\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.350\nThey steal my laptop, they boot into\nrecovery, they reset my password,\n\n302\n00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.770\nnow they can get in.\n\n303\n00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.050\nAnd yes, that's true,\nthey could absolutely do that.\n\n304\n00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.940\nSomebody could reset your password and\nget in.\n\n305\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.030\nAll right, so how do we prevent that?\n\n306\n00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:04.290\nWell, there's two good ways to prevent it.\n\n307\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.682\nThe best is to turn on file vault,\n\n308\n00:15:06.682 --> 00:15:09.380\ndisk encryption,\nI'll talk about that in a few minutes.\n\n309\n00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.020\nBut another way is we can set\nwhat's called a firmware password.\n\n310\n00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.900\nA firmware password, is a password stored\non the motherboard of your Mac and\n\n311\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.420\nwhen you boot up it's gonna prompt you for\nthat firmware password.\n\n312\n00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.290\nAnd if you don't know it\nyou can't get logged in.\n\n313\n00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.860\nNow the firmware password\ndoesn't show up every time.\n\n314\n00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.840\nIf you boot from your hard drive and\nyou load Mac OS it won't prompt you.\n\n315\n00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.536\nBut if you boot from your hard drive and\n\n316\n00:15:33.536 --> 00:15:36.414\nboot into Mac OS you've got to\nknow your user password to get in.\n\n317\n00:15:36.414 --> 00:15:40.447\nBut if you do Command R or you hold down\noption to boot off of removable media or\n\n318\n00:15:40.447 --> 00:15:44.430\nboot to recovery, that's when it\nprompts you for the firmware password.\n\n319\n00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.320\nSo it's locking access to this.\n\n320\n00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.610\nSo they can't even get to\nthe password reset utility.\n\n321\n00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.882\nA firmware password can help\nus get around that, all right?\n\n322\n00:15:51.882 --> 00:15:54.181\nIt can stop people from\nhaving this access.\n\n323\n00:15:54.181 --> 00:15:56.955\nAnd the way you do it is\nright here in recovery.\n\n324\n00:15:56.955 --> 00:16:01.275\nWhen you're in recovery, If I get back\nout to the main menu, when I go to\n\n325\n00:16:01.275 --> 00:16:06.730\nthe Utilities menu we'll see that Firmware\nPassword Utility, it's right there.\n\n326\n00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.560\nI can turn on that firmware password and\nnow when somebody boots up they won't be\n\n327\n00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.500\nable to get to recovery\nwithout setting this.\n\n328\n00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.200\nOkay, now I'm in a virtual machine so\nit's not gonna let me do it.\n\n329\n00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.190\nIt's gonna tell me my\nfirmware's not supported.\n\n330\n00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:21.310\nBut if you jump over to our Mac\nManagement Basics show, I actually take\n\n331\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.030\na Mac Mini and put the firmware password\non that one and get it all locked up.\n\n332\n00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.540\nSo if you want to see it in action,\nyou can jump over there and see it.\n\n333\n00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.850\nBut I'll be honest with you guys,\nI don't normally set a firmware password.\n\n334\n00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:35.700\nAnd the reason is yes, this stops somebody\nfrom getting to recovery on my laptop.\n\n335\n00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.080\nBut all they had to do is open the laptop,\ntake the hard drive out,\n\n336\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.580\nand stick the hard drive\ninto another computer.\n\n337\n00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.620\nThe firmware password\nis on your motherboard.\n\n338\n00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.230\nIt's not on your hard drive.\n\n339\n00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.100\nAnd so if they rip that hard drive out,\ndoesn't matter if I had a firmware\n\n340\n00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.460\npassword or not,\nthey're now going to be able to take that,\n\n341\n00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.460\nstick it into another computer and\nboot it into recovery.\n\n342\n00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.470\n>> So\nnow if the users forgot their password,\n\n343\n00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.960\nwe can take some steps to recover it or\nchange it like you've said.\n\n344\n00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.900\nWhat happens if we lose or\nforget the firmware password?\n\n345\n00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.586\nWhat do we have to do?\n\n346\n00:17:04.586 --> 00:17:05.374\n>> You're kind of screwed.\n\n347\n00:17:05.374 --> 00:17:08.076\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't want to forget your firmware\n\n348\n00:17:08.076 --> 00:17:11.196\npassword, if you forget your firmware\npassword the only way to reset it is to\n\n349\n00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:12.660\ntake it into an Apple Store.\n\n350\n00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.840\nYou take it into Apple and they'll\nverify your ownership of that laptop.\n\n351\n00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.750\nYou gotta show them a receipt to show that\nyou own it, or your Mac Mini or whatever.\n\n352\n00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.790\nSo you gotta prove that you own it and\nthen they'll reset the firmware password,\n\n353\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.530\nbut there's no way for you to do it.\n\n354\n00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.380\nIf you search the Internet you'll see\nsome stuff where people talk about it.\n\n355\n00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.950\nPrior to 2010, so we're talking six years\nago, prior to 2010 what you could do is\n\n356\n00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.220\nyou could open up your computer and\nit would have at least two memory sticks.\n\n357\n00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.630\nAnd you could swap the memory sticks, and\nthat would reset the firmware password.\n\n358\n00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:39.970\nAnd so you could do that.\n\n359\n00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:41.190\nIt doesn't work that way on newer ones.\n\n360\n00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.160\nIn fact, on most macs, you can't even\nremove the memory sticks anymore.\n\n361\n00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.750\nThey're soldered right onto the\nmotherboard, so that doesn't work anymore.\n\n362\n00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.050\nNow you've got to take it to the apple\nstore, it's not a viable option.\n\n363\n00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.640\nAll right, so on this one,\nI'm good to go and I mentioned,\n\n364\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.970\nI don't use a firmware password.\n\n365\n00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.190\nAnd the reason I don't,\nsomebody could rip that hard drive out and\n\n366\n00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:59.570\ntake it somewhere else.\n\n367\n00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:00.690\nWell, how do I protect from that?\n\n368\n00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.450\nAnd the answer to that is disk encryption.\n\n369\n00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.700\nFileVault, right?\n\n370\n00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.610\nI use FileVault instead of using\na firmware password, because FileVault\n\n371\n00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:12.130\nprotects you from somebody booting into\nrecovery, and it protects you from\n\n372\n00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.950\nsomebody ripping your hard drive out and\ntaking it somewhere else.\n\n373\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.060\nIt's better protection, so\nI don't normally mess with this.\n\n374\n00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:22.810\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nboot back into my operating system.\n\n375\n00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.710\nAnd once I boot back up,\n\n376\n00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:29.640\nthere it is I’m gonna restart, my user\naccount has had its password reset.\n\n377\n00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.230\nAnd so when I boot back up and\n\n378\n00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:36.830\nget into my OS, I should be able\nto put in my new reset password.\n\n379\n00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.080\nBut when I access my Keychain I’m gonna\nhave a little bit of a problem there.\n\n380\n00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.240\nThat part is not gonna work for me, but\nas far as getting logged in, I’ll be fine.\n\n381\n00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.230\nAnd it's good because I can’t\nremember the other password.\n\n382\n00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.590\nIt was three and a pound majors.\n\n383\n00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.690\nIt was a busy-\n>> It was busy three pound majors.\n\n384\n00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.620\n>> Shows how memorable that password was.\n\n385\n00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.380\nSo I've already forgotten it,\nbut now I reset my password.\n\n386\n00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.520\nNow it's password 1,2,3.\n\n387\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.210\nI can remember that and\nI'm gonna get logged in.\n\n388\n00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.970\nSo as soon as that gets up we\nshould see that new password.\n\n389\n00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.695\nNow let's talk about FileVault\nwhile we're waiting on that.\n\n390\n00:19:05.695 --> 00:19:07.866\nFileVault, there's actually\ntwo versions of FileVault,\n\n391\n00:19:07.866 --> 00:19:09.410\nFileVault version 1 and version 2.\n\n392\n00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.110\nThose are the two versions.\n\n393\n00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.270\nVersion 1 was the original\nthat Apple put out, and\n\n394\n00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.660\nwhat FileVault version 1 did is,\nit just encrypted your Home folder.\n\n395\n00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.660\nSo if I had a Home folder, I would have\nit encrypted, and it's just that one.\n\n396\n00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.180\nAnother user could have a Home\nfolder that's not encrypted.\n\n397\n00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.288\nSo the original version of FileVault I'm\njust gonna log in here with my new\n\n398\n00:19:28.288 --> 00:19:29.130\npassword.\n\n399\n00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.180\nThere we go.\n\n400\n00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:35.290\nThe original version of FileVault can be\nturned on and off on a per user basis.\n\n401\n00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:38.240\nThe new version of FileVault encrypts\nthe entire hard drive, and so\n\n402\n00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.940\nit's not done on a per user it's done for\nthe entire system.\n\n403\n00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.573\nAll right.\nNow that this one booted back up, and\n\n404\n00:19:43.573 --> 00:19:45.704\nI know, I'm jumping between\ntopics just a little destroying,\n\n405\n00:19:45.704 --> 00:19:47.100\nlet's jump back to this.\n\n406\n00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.390\nI reset my password, I logged in and I put\npassword 1,2,3, that's my new password,\n\n407\n00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.660\nand then I get this prompt.\n\n408\n00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.090\nThe system was unable to\nunlock your Keychain.\n\n409\n00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.990\nThe Keychain password\ndoesn't match anymore.\n\n410\n00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.220\nSo I've got a choice.\n\n411\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.140\nI can create a new Keychain,\njust start from scratch.\n\n412\n00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.420\nI don't remember my old password, I know\nthere's no way you can unlock it, so\n\n413\n00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.520\nforget it.\n\n414\n00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.530\nJust give me a new Keychain.\n\n415\n00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.580\nI guess I continue to log in and\nnow just won't have a Keychain at all.\n\n416\n00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.840\nAnd I won’t be able to remember password\nor I can update the Keychain password.\n\n417\n00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:19.360\nThat will only work if you\nremember the original password and\n\n418\n00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.650\nI probably wouldn't have reset my password\nif I can remember the original one.\n\n419\n00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:27.960\nBut If I do know my original password I\ncan punch it in and now it's gonna update\n\n420\n00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.830\nit so that it reflects my new password and\nI'll be able to access that Keychain.\n\n421\n00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.540\nSo normally though, you're gonna\nhave to create a new Keychain.\n\n422\n00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.300\nYou're just gonna have to\nstart that one over again\n\n423\n00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.780\ncuz you don't have a way to decrypt it.\n\n424\n00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.280\nAnd tell the user to\nremember their password.\n\n425\n00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.970\nAll right, so back to FileVault.\n\n426\n00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.470\nWe have FileVault version 1 and\nFileVault version 2.\n\n427\n00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.520\nApple doesn't call version\n1 version 1 anymore.\n\n428\n00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.930\nAnd they call version two\njust plain old FileVault.\n\n429\n00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.910\nVersion 1 they refer to\nas Legacy FileVault.\n\n430\n00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:56.790\nBecause the problem with it was it\nonly encrypted your home directory.\n\n431\n00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.160\nSo if somebody stole your laptop\nthey could still boot to MacOS.\n\n432\n00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.070\nThey could still browse your hard drive.\n\n433\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.010\nThey just couldn't get\ninto your home directory.\n\n434\n00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:07.780\nAnd if you save data outside of\nyour home directory by accident,\n\n435\n00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.170\nthey can gain access to it.\n\n436\n00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.070\nAnd so that was a problem that we had.\n\n437\n00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.730\nAnd each user had to turn it on.\n\n438\n00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.960\nSo with the new FileVault that\ndoes the whole hard drive\n\n439\n00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.640\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n440\n00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.520\nIf you do into your system preferences and\nyou go into Privacy & Security or\n\n441\n00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:26.430\nother way around, Security & Privacy,\n[LAUGH] you can go in there and at\n\n442\n00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:31.710\na minimum you're gonna see a FileVault tab\nand that's the new FileVault version 2.\n\n443\n00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.510\nBut, if you had a system that was\nrunning Mountain Lion or earlier, and\n\n444\n00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.450\nyou had turned on Legacy FireVault and\nthen upgraded, right?\n\n445\n00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:43.490\nMaybe you upgraded to Mavericks and\nthen upgraded to Yosemite and\n\n446\n00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:47.240\nnow you've upgraded to El Capitan,\nthen you might have the Legacy FileVault.\n\n447\n00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.620\nAnd you'd have another tab that shows\nup here that says Legacy FileVault,\n\n448\n00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.990\nI don't have it because my system\nwasn't upgraded 20 times and\n\n449\n00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.950\nI don't have that older technology.\n\n450\n00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.730\n>> Now what if you do have one of those\nolder drives that's been encrypted with\n\n451\n00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.670\nthe earlier with FileVault and\n\n452\n00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.930\nlet's say I just wanna take\nadvantage of the new technologies.\n\n453\n00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.000\nIs there a method can I take\nadvantage of the new technology or\n\n454\n00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.670\nam I pretty much I don't know.\n\n455\n00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.190\n>> What you need to do is you\nneed to decrypt your drive.\n\n456\n00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.930\nYou need to turn off Legacy FileVault,\ndecrypt that data.\n\n457\n00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:19.490\nNow, if it's per-user thing,\neach user has their own key, right?\n\n458\n00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:23.240\nWell, there's actually a master\npassword that's set that\n\n459\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.210\nthe administrator can use to\ndecrypt everybody else's stuff.\n\n460\n00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.192\nAnd you might have noticed when I was\nback, let me get back into Users & Groups.\n\n461\n00:22:29.192 --> 00:22:33.984\nWhen I was in Users & Groups right\nin here, if I unlock this screen and\n\n462\n00:22:33.984 --> 00:22:38.080\n[LAUGH] with whatever my\npassword happens to be now.\n\n463\n00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.200\nIf I unlock this screen and\nI click on this gear.\n\n464\n00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.710\nSee how it's got this set master password?\n\n465\n00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:44.830\nWe don't really use\nthe master password anymore.\n\n466\n00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:49.050\nBut the Master Password was used\nas a central encryption key\n\n467\n00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.990\nthat was able to decrypt all\nthe users FileVault version 1 stuff.\n\n468\n00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.680\nRight.\n\n469\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.710\nSo if you have that Legacy FileVault tab,\nwhich again, I don’t.\n\n470\n00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:58.850\nModern machines aren't gonna have it.\n\n471\n00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.950\nBut if you have it you’ll have an option\nthere to turn off Legacy FileVault.\n\n472\n00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.610\nAnd it’s gonna use that master password\nto decrypt all of their home folders and\n\n473\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.070\nnow you're not encrypted.\n\n474\n00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:13.020\nAnd then you just go to the regular\nfile vault tab and you turn it on.\n\n475\n00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.950\nAnd now it encrypts the entire drive and\ngives you the best level of security.\n\n476\n00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.800\nSo, if you haven't done file vault,\ndon't even bother with legacy file vault.\n\n477\n00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.390\nOn the exam it's never the right answer.\n\n478\n00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.190\nDon't do the old one,\nyou wanna do file fault version 2.\n\n479\n00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:28.200\n>> Now you've mentioned encryption so\nI can only imagine when you talk about any\n\n480\n00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.120\nkind of security technology going from\nLegacy to something newer, what kind of\n\n481\n00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.430\nencryption are we talking about here\nwhen it comes to the newer FileVault?\n\n482\n00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:39.730\n>> So it's using AES 128, and it's\na stronger encryption than the old one.\n\n483\n00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.360\nBut even if they were the same,\nit's still going to be better cuz\n\n484\n00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.950\nwe're doing the whole drive and\nnot just the single folder.\n\n485\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.510\nSo do it for stronger encryption.\n\n486\n00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.690\nBut do it for\nmore reliable encryption, right?\n\n487\n00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:50.910\nLet's do in that whole drive.\n\n488\n00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:51.951\nAnd it's really easy to turn this on.\n\n489\n00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:55.644\nIn fact your engines, they won't even\nrealize that encryption is turned on.\n\n490\n00:23:55.644 --> 00:23:58.059\nOnce it's on it's kind\nof invisible to them.\n\n491\n00:23:58.059 --> 00:24:00.141\nBecause it's very similar\nto the firmware password.\n\n492\n00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:03.011\nRemember, with a firmware password,\nwhen I boot my system,\n\n493\n00:24:03.011 --> 00:24:04.997\nif I just boot off\nthe internal hard drive,\n\n494\n00:24:04.997 --> 00:24:08.220\nit'll take me right to a log in screen and\nI can log in and I can work.\n\n495\n00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.330\nI never see the firmware password.\n\n496\n00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.350\nIf I boot to recovery, or\nI try and boot to target mode or\n\n497\n00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.840\nsomething like that,\nI see that firmware password.\n\n498\n00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.450\nFileVault's the same way.\n\n499\n00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:21.450\nIf I just boot the operating system,\nI can get to that login screen, and\n\n500\n00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:24.650\nwhen the user logs in,\nthat's them passing and saying yes,\n\n501\n00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.150\nI'm allowed to decrypt this stuff, right?\n\n502\n00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.660\nBut if I try and boot to recovery,\nor I try and boot to target mode, or\n\n503\n00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.300\nI rip the hard drive out and\nput it in another system,\n\n504\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.690\nI'm gonna have to provide\nmy FileVault credentials.\n\n505\n00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.990\nA username and password that's\nallowed to access that drive.\n\n506\n00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.230\nAnd so that's where that\nextra protection comes from.\n\n507\n00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.340\nIt doesn't inconvenience\nyour users at all and\n\n508\n00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.280\non modern systems it doesn't\neven impact performance.\n\n509\n00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.220\nBut, hardly a bit.\n\n510\n00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.460\nIt's really negligible the amount\nof performance impact you take.\n\n511\n00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.470\nBecause the private key is actually being\nstored in hardware on the system, so\n\n512\n00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:54.790\nit happens at wire speeds.\n\n513\n00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:56.430\nVery, very fast.\n\n514\n00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.380\nTurning on FileVault is pretty easy.\n\n515\n00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:05.660\nAll we have to do is unlock our\nscreen with our correct password, and\n\n516\n00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.950\nthen we can choose to turn on FileVault.\n\n517\n00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:11.130\nNow it doesn't matter if you've already\ngot data on your system or not.\n\n518\n00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.310\nIt's gonna encrypt the entire system.\n\n519\n00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:18.310\nNow if your system is brand new, it won't\ntake that long to get this turned on.\n\n520\n00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.820\nYour hard drive's mostly empty.\n\n521\n00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.380\nBut if you've got a ton of data It can\ntake a long time for it to encrypt\n\n522\n00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.290\nthe system, but fortunately you'll be able\nto use the system while it's encrypting.\n\n523\n00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:30.010\nSo, you can turn this on and\nthen continue to work throughout the day.\n\n524\n00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.490\nBut it is gonna require one reboot.\n\n525\n00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.600\nThere's system files that are always\nin use and it can't encrypt them while\n\n526\n00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.160\nthey're in use, and so it's gonna have\nto reboot to encrypt that data for us.\n\n527\n00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.680\nSo, we'll see that.\n\n528\n00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.680\nNow, the third thing it's gonna ask me is\nwhether or not I wanna tie this to iCloud.\n\n529\n00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.480\nNow, why would I do that?\n\n530\n00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.780\nRemember when Wes asked about the firmware\npassword and what if we forget that?\n\n531\n00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.010\nI said you can take it to an Apple store.\n\n532\n00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.200\nWhat if you forget your\nFireVault password?\n\n533\n00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:55.190\nApple can't help you.\n\n534\n00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:56.880\nThey don't know the password.\n\n535\n00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.350\nSo you just lost your data, right?\n\n536\n00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.050\nIt's that sensitive.\n\n537\n00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.180\nYou've got to keep your password safe,\nyou've got to know what it is.\n\n538\n00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.720\nOtherwise they can't help you, right?\n\n539\n00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.090\nThey'll just format the drive for you and\n\n540\n00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:09.650\nput a fresh and clean install of Mac OS,\nbut you've lost all your data.\n\n541\n00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:14.110\nBut you do have the option to set\nup iCloud to store the password.\n\n542\n00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.530\nSo you can encrypt your system and\n\n543\n00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.220\nthe recovery key will get stored\nup in your iCloud account.\n\n544\n00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.910\nSo if you ever forget it, well,\nyou can login with your iCloud account.\n\n545\n00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.530\nYou can reset your iCloud account's\npassword and now you can login and\n\n546\n00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.240\nit's stored there and it's safe.\n\n547\n00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.690\nOn a positive side you've\ngot a backup online,\n\n548\n00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.410\non a negative side you've\ngot a backup online.\n\n549\n00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:34.210\nWhich means that Apple could be\nsubpoenaed for that password and\n\n550\n00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:40.170\nthey'd have to disclose it and\nnow the government, or hackers that do\n\n551\n00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.670\na phishing attempt against Apple might be\nable to potentially get into your system.\n\n552\n00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:47.280\nKeeping it yourself,\nthat's the safest bet, but\n\n553\n00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.770\nit exposes you to the risk of\nlosing that password, right?\n\n554\n00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:51.580\nI'm just gonna keep mine.\n\n555\n00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.460\nHere's the recovery key\nthat I'm talking about.\n\n556\n00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.250\nThis is what would be stored\nin the Apple account.\n\n557\n00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:02.460\nIf anybody has this key, they could\nboot to recovery, provide this key,\n\n558\n00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.160\nand now access all of your data.\n\n559\n00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.500\nThat you take your hard drive out, add it\nto another machine, provide this key, and\n\n560\n00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.570\naccess your data.\n\n561\n00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:12.420\nThis key can decrypt\nyour entire hard drive.\n\n562\n00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.410\nSo, don't just write it\ndown on a post it note and\n\n563\n00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:17.950\nstick it on your wall where everybody can\nsee it, you need to put it in a text file,\n\n564\n00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:21.410\nburn it to a disk, and store it somewhere\nsafe, like in a locked vault or safe.\n\n565\n00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.660\nDon't save it as a text\nfile on your hard drive.\n\n566\n00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.860\nBecause of you forget your password and\n\n567\n00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.620\nyou're locked out you won't be\nable to get to that text file.\n\n568\n00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.570\nThat text file is encrypted, so\nyou got to store it somewhere safe.\n\n569\n00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:34.060\nWhat I'm gonna do is not store it\nanywhere, I'm just gonna continue.\n\n570\n00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.050\nNow I don't remember\nwhat that password is.\n\n571\n00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.790\nI guess I could go back and watch this\nepisode and maybe figure out what it is.\n\n572\n00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:43.610\nBut I'm banking on the fact that I'm never\ngonna forget my user accounts password.\n\n573\n00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.930\nAs long as I have a valid user account,\nI can log in and\n\n574\n00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:48.670\nI won't need that recovery key.\n\n575\n00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.460\nThe only time you need that recovery\nkey is if you can not remember\n\n576\n00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.460\nthe password for\nan admin account in your system.\n\n577\n00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.890\nIf I boot into recovery right now,\nI either\n\n578\n00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:03.160\nhave to provide a valid username and\npassword, or I have to provide that key.\n\n579\n00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.050\nAnd if I don't have that key any more,\nthen I'm out of luck.\n\n580\n00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.950\nNow notice how my login screen\nlooks a little bit different?\n\n581\n00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:12.640\nI've got black bars on the side of my\nscreen now, I'm in a 4:3 resolution.\n\n582\n00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.470\nAnd that's because when this is booting,\n\n583\n00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.610\nit's not actually booting\nMac OS right now.\n\n584\n00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.930\nIt looks like it,\nit's a username and password.\n\n585\n00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:22.530\nBut what I'm really looking at\nis a FileVault login screen.\n\n586\n00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:26.130\nIt's asking for\nmy valid username and system so\n\n587\n00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.200\nit can be allowed to decrypt the hard\ndrive to find the operating system.\n\n588\n00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.670\nIt has not booted Mac OS at this point.\n\n589\n00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.710\nIt's booting FileVault.\n\n590\n00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.150\nAnd now once it has a valid password\nit's able to decrypt the hard drive.\n\n591\n00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.340\nAnd we can start to boot\nthe real operating system.\n\n592\n00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.420\nAnd so there it goes.\n\n593\n00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.210\nMy boot process is different.\n\n594\n00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:44.970\nYour average end user\nwill not notice that.\n\n595\n00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.370\nThey’ll not notice any\ndifference in that at all.\n\n596\n00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.030\nThey see their user account,\nthey put in their password.\n\n597\n00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:50.760\nBut the reality is,\nit is a different system.\n\n598\n00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.320\nApple is just trying to make\nit as transparent as possible.\n\n599\n00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.970\nAnd as soon as we get to the log in,\nit’s booting the system and\n\n600\n00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:01.680\nat that point users will have no idea\nthat the entire hard drive is encrypted.\n\n601\n00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.620\nNow it's not completely true,\n\n602\n00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.690\nthe entire hard drive isn't encrypted yet,\nit's still gotta finish it.\n\n603\n00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.670\nIt's only encrypted the system files.\n\n604\n00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.690\nNow as soon as the boot is done it's\ngonna encrypt the rest of the drive.\n\n605\n00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:16.130\nAnd if I've got a terabyte of\ndata it might take four or\n\n606\n00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:19.660\nfive hours for it to encrypt\nthat entire hard drive, right.\n\n607\n00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.690\nIf I have a very small\namount of data like I do,\n\n608\n00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:23.390\nit'll probably take less than ten minutes.\n\n609\n00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:24.250\nSo within ten minutes,\n\n610\n00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:28.860\nthe entire drive will be encrypted, and\nit gives me that status right here.\n\n611\n00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.210\nIt's encrypting, and\nhow much time I have remaining.\n\n612\n00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:32.540\nI can use the system right now.\n\n613\n00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.220\nI can just keep working,\nbrowse the Internet,\n\n614\n00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.590\ndo what I want, but\nknow that your not 100% safe yet.\n\n615\n00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.320\nNot until this bar gets all the way\nacross am I completely safe.\n\n616\n00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.290\nSo it's giving me about ten minutes and\n\n617\n00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.750\nit will encrypt this drive and\nthen I'm protected.\n\n618\n00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.940\nUntil then, I'm just at risk.\n\n619\n00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.250\nSo if somebody were to rip\nout the hard drive right now,\n\n620\n00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:52.900\nsome of the data's encrypted,\nsome of it's not.\n\n621\n00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.240\nSo they might be able to get to\nsome of that unencrypted data.\n\n622\n00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.930\nBut in five more minutes, if they rip this\nhard drive out, it's useless to them.\n\n623\n00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:04.670\nThe whole thing is encrypted,\nand every user on my computer,\n\n624\n00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:07.970\nif I go into the users and\ngroups and start adding more users,\n\n625\n00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:11.570\neach of those users will be\nallowed to decrypt that drive.\n\n626\n00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:15.560\nSo if I create an account here for\nWes, let me show back here and\n\n627\n00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.820\nI'll create an account for Wes.\n\n628\n00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.800\nI don't remember that password sooner or\nlater.\n\n629\n00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:24.000\nSo, when I create an account for him,\nhe's just a standard user, right?\n\n630\n00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.450\nI'm not doing anything\ntoo crazy with that.\n\n631\n00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.590\nHe's just gonna be a standard user.\n\n632\n00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:33.090\nBut his standard user\nis going to get a key\n\n633\n00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:36.170\nattached to it that allows him\nto decrypt the hard drive too.\n\n634\n00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.760\nSo if I shut this computer off and\nturn it on, he can log in.\n\n635\n00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.660\nHe can put his credentials and\n\n636\n00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.850\nlog in cuz he's got that key to\nbe able to get in there, right.\n\n637\n00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:45.550\nAny valid user account\nwill be able to do that.\n\n638\n00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:50.140\nBut I also just need to keep an eye\non this security and privacy screen.\n\n639\n00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.250\nI got three more minutes and\nthe drive will be encrypted.\n\n640\n00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:55.690\nBut as far as a regular user,\nI see my desktop, I can fire up Safari,\n\n641\n00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:58.660\nI can browse the Internet,\nI can do whatever it is I want to do.\n\n642\n00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:00.730\nAnd everything is like normal.\n\n643\n00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.120\nI don't even know the drive is encrypted.\n\n644\n00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.220\nThat's the best part,\nit's completely transparent.\n\n645\n00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.210\n>> Great information.\n\n646\n00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:08.780\nKeep in mind that we've been looking\nat the security of user accounts, but\n\n647\n00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.260\nit does look like we're coming to the end-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n648\n00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.100\n>> Of our episode.\n\n649\n00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.060\nDon, got anything else for us in this one?\n\n650\n00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.190\n>> That's about it.\n\n651\n00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:16.040\nJust remember FileVault is so easy to use.\n\n652\n00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.800\nYou should be using it on a mobile\ncomputer definitely but even on desktops.\n\n653\n00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.030\nSomebody could break\ninto your building and\n\n654\n00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:24.380\nsteal your equipment,\nyou gotta make sure that data is safe.\n\n655\n00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.750\nAnd don't forget your password.\n\n656\n00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.350\nThat's really the big lesson here, is you\nalways want to remember your password,\n\n657\n00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.730\notherwise you can get yourself locked out\nand sometimes you can't recover from that.\n\n658\n00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.030\n>> Good words of wisdom.\n\n659\n00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.070\nKeep them in mind out there.\n\n660\n00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.390\nBut we're going to go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n661\n00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.160\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n662\n00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:39.850\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n663\n00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.090\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n664\n00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:49.280\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.428\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:20.239\nin today's episode we're continuing along\nthe journey that leads ultimately to\n\n5\n00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.350\nthe Apple certified support\nprofessional certification.\n\n6\n00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.731\nWe've got none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet here to help us out with that.\n\n7\n00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:26.787\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:26.787 --> 00:00:28.342\n>> I am doing great, Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:28.342 --> 00:00:31.126\nReady to continue on with\nour professional adventure.\n\n10\n00:00:31.126 --> 00:00:34.350\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at disk storage.\n\n11\n00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.070\nI know we've briefly touched on disk\nstorage back when we were talking about\n\n12\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.330\ninstalling OS X, cuz you have to\npick what hard drive to install.\n\n13\n00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.030\nBut that's only the tip of the iceberg,\nright.\n\n14\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.951\nYou do have your internal hard drive.\n\n15\n00:00:44.951 --> 00:00:45.705\nThat's great.\n\n16\n00:00:45.705 --> 00:00:47.041\nBut as you use your system,\n\n17\n00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:50.123\nthere's gonna be quite a bit of\nremovable media you bring in and\n\n18\n00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:54.045\nout of your environment, and there's\na number of different types of storage.\n\n19\n00:00:54.045 --> 00:00:57.123\nAnd so we just need to be familiar\nwith what's supported by OS X,\n\n20\n00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.346\nwhat we can do with it,\nwhat it looks like, and\n\n21\n00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:02.770\nwhat's kind of required of us to use\nthose different types of storage.\n\n22\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.350\nSo we're gonna see all of that\nright here in this episode.\n\n23\n00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.367\nAnd I've been a little aggressive in\nmy note taking for this episode, so\n\n24\n00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:09.806\nwe might have to do a part two on it.\n\n25\n00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:13.070\nJust be prepared,\n[LAUGH] and see how it goes.\n\n26\n00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.862\nBut let's just kick things\noff talking about storage.\n\n27\n00:01:16.862 --> 00:01:21.355\nNow, when you buy a Mac,\nit doesn't matter if it's a laptop, or\n\n28\n00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:23.680\na desktop, or whatever.\n\n29\n00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.745\nAt a minimum,\nit's gonna have one hard drive in it.\n\n30\n00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:28.911\nBecause the operating system\nhas to go somewhere, and\n\n31\n00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:30.800\nit's going to be on that hard drive.\n\n32\n00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.420\nNow, when you go and\nbuy a device from Apple,\n\n33\n00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.230\nthere's two different types of hard\ndrives you can pick from these days.\n\n34\n00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.280\nThere used to be three.\n\n35\n00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.894\nI think there's really only two now.\n\n36\n00:01:38.894 --> 00:01:42.854\nSo there's traditional hard drives,\nor what Apple calls HDDs,\n\n37\n00:01:42.854 --> 00:01:47.174\nthe hard disk drives, and\nthen there's the newer Flash based drives,\n\n38\n00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:50.690\nwhich are solid state digital drives,\nor SSDs.\n\n39\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.790\nNow the SSDs are way faster\nthan the older hard drives,\n\n40\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.566\nthe older magnetic spinning disks.\n\n41\n00:01:57.566 --> 00:02:01.020\nThey were called spinning discs because\ninside of them there's actually\n\n42\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.080\nthese platters, kind of like a CD or\na record player or whatever,\n\n43\n00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.720\nand it has to spin around, and a little\nmotorized arm has to move to find data.\n\n44\n00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.278\nAnd that process is slow.\n\n45\n00:02:09.278 --> 00:02:10.983\nIt takes a while.\n\n46\n00:02:10.983 --> 00:02:15.026\nVersus SSDs, with Solid State Digital,\nthey've got flash chips inside them,\n\n47\n00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:16.720\nthey've got memory.\n\n48\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.513\nAnd if I want to read\ndata out of that memory,\n\n49\n00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:20.514\nI just go right to that address and\nget that data.\n\n50\n00:02:20.514 --> 00:02:24.196\nThere's no mechanical arm, there's\nno motor, there's no disk spinning,\n\n51\n00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:26.750\nthere's no moving parts whatsoever.\n\n52\n00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.703\nAnd that makes SSD more durable.\n\n53\n00:02:28.703 --> 00:02:32.110\nIf you drop your laptop,\na spinning disk can get damaged.\n\n54\n00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.450\nBut if you drop your laptop,\nyour SSD is likely gonna be fine.\n\n55\n00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.090\nYour display is more likely\nto break than your SSD is.\n\n56\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.292\nIt's also faster so\nit's really the ideal solution.\n\n57\n00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:43.010\nWe want to go with SSD's.\n\n58\n00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.050\nIf they're so much better, why does Apple\nstill sell traditional hard drives?\n\n59\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.568\nWell, it comes down to two things.\n\n60\n00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:52.100\nThere's two things that we\ncan't do well with SSD.\n\n61\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.460\nOne is money, right?\n\n62\n00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.794\nSSD's cost more money.\n\n63\n00:02:56.794 --> 00:03:00.029\nSo for me to get 256 gig SSD,\n\n64\n00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:05.960\ncost about the same as a one\nterabyte spinning disc.\n\n65\n00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.758\nSo I can get lot more storage for\na lot less money if\n\n66\n00:03:08.758 --> 00:03:13.346\nI stick with the traditional spinning\ndisc, but it's lower if I get more of it.\n\n67\n00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:15.331\nSo I kinda had to choose.\n\n68\n00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:17.247\nThe other thing is heat.\n\n69\n00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:20.620\nSSDs put off more heat than\ntraditional spinning disks.\n\n70\n00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.978\nNow, in a desktop we don't\nnecessarily worry about that.\n\n71\n00:03:22.978 --> 00:03:26.671\nIf you have a Mac Pro it's got a big fan\ninside of it and it can move air and\n\n72\n00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:28.810\ntemperature is not a problem.\n\n73\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.093\nBut if you've got a Mac Mini, that's a lot\nof hardware jammed in a very small space.\n\n74\n00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:36.615\nIf you've got a Macbook Air that's\na lot of hardware jammed in\n\n75\n00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:38.290\nan even smaller space.\n\n76\n00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.084\nThen that heat dissipation\nbecomes a problem.\n\n77\n00:03:40.084 --> 00:03:43.487\nAnd so large quantities of SSD aren't\nnecessarily possible cuz they put out too\n\n78\n00:03:43.487 --> 00:03:44.010\nmuch heat.\n\n79\n00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.227\nNow, they have gotten way better in recent\nyears than they were even five years ago.\n\n80\n00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:51.890\nSo you're starting to see more and\nmore and more storage available.\n\n81\n00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.218\nYou can get Macs with 500 GB of SSD.\n\n82\n00:03:53.218 --> 00:03:55.210\nThat’s what I have in my laptop.\n\n83\n00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.637\nOr you can get,\nthey've creeped up a little higher.\n\n84\n00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:59.030\nYou're starting to see bigger numbers.\n\n85\n00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.283\nI don't think anybody's\nreally broken a terabyte.\n\n86\n00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.255\nYou can go out and\nget more than a terabyte but\n\n87\n00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:07.346\nI think if you go to Apple Store,\na terabyte is about the most SSD based\n\n88\n00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:10.920\nstorage that you can get versus spinning\ndisc where you can get three terabyte,\n\n89\n00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.210\nfour terabyte even six terabyte\noptions that are out there.\n\n90\n00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.115\nSo those are the two main options HDD and\nSSD right?\n\n91\n00:04:18.115 --> 00:04:23.740\nThe traditional spinning hard discs and\nthe newer solid state digital discs.\n\n92\n00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.261\nThere’s few other ones that are out there.\n\n93\n00:04:25.261 --> 00:04:28.170\nFor example, you might hear\nwhat’s called a Fusion Drive.\n\n94\n00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.564\nSo for a little while Apple\nwas producing these and\n\n95\n00:04:30.564 --> 00:04:32.502\nI don’t think they sell them anymore but\n\n96\n00:04:32.502 --> 00:04:36.041\nit was really up until like last year\nthey were doing these Fusion Drives.\n\n97\n00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:40.950\nAnd what a Fusion Drive was, was actually\nnot one drive, it was two drives.\n\n98\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.892\nWith a Fusion Drive, you had a traditional\nhard drive that was a spinning disk,\n\n99\n00:04:46.892 --> 00:04:50.364\nand you had an SSD, but\nit was a very small SSD.\n\n100\n00:04:50.364 --> 00:04:54.090\nSo for example, I think I was using\na Mac Mini on the show the other day.\n\n101\n00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.123\nIt had a one terabyte spinning disk,\nand a 128 gig SSD,\n\n102\n00:04:59.123 --> 00:05:05.418\nand Mac OS will take those and bond\nthem together to create a Fusion Disk.\n\n103\n00:05:05.418 --> 00:05:10.110\nAnd the way a fusion disk works is the\ndata you access the most frequently gets\n\n104\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.770\nmoved to the SSD.\n\n105\n00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.414\nAnd data that you access less frequently\ngets put over on the spinning disk.\n\n106\n00:05:15.414 --> 00:05:17.474\nAnd that way, you get a ton of storage and\n\n107\n00:05:17.474 --> 00:05:21.300\nyou get the benefits of speed without\nhaving to dump all that money into it.\n\n108\n00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.253\nSo Fusion Disks are kinda neat, but the\nprice of SSD has come down a good bit, and\n\n109\n00:05:25.253 --> 00:05:28.970\nso we're gonna see those go away because\nthere's some added problems with\n\n110\n00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.288\nFusion Disks that make\nthem not really ideal.\n\n111\n00:05:31.288 --> 00:05:34.960\nIt's two disks, but\nyour system sees it as one.\n\n112\n00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.614\nWell, what happens if one\nof those disks fails?\n\n113\n00:05:37.614 --> 00:05:38.682\nYou lose everything.\n\n114\n00:05:38.682 --> 00:05:41.390\nIt's not like you can salvage\nwhat's left on the other disk.\n\n115\n00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.970\nThere's ways, but not officially.\n\n116\n00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.260\nSo you lose that data.\n\n117\n00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.914\nSo they're more prone to failure,\nversus if you had a single disk.\n\n118\n00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:51.211\nNow, single disk is prone to failure too,\nbut you just do a time machine backup,\n\n119\n00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:53.120\nyou can restore,\nit's not that big of a deal.\n\n120\n00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.034\nFusion Disk is a little bit more complex,\nso\n\n121\n00:05:55.034 --> 00:05:57.226\nthey're not the greatest\nsolution in the world.\n\n122\n00:05:57.226 --> 00:05:59.325\nIf you can go all SSD,\nthat's certainly the best, but\n\n123\n00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:01.250\nyou're gonna have to come\nout of pocket for that.\n\n124\n00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.118\nIt's expensive.\n\n125\n00:06:02.118 --> 00:06:05.059\nAll right, so those are the two main\ntypes of storage were gonna see,\n\n126\n00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:07.430\nspinning disc and solid state disc.\n\n127\n00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.203\nBut those aren't the only ones.\n\n128\n00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:12.890\nIf you have an older Mac, you might have\nother types of removable media that can be\n\n129\n00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.670\nall sorts of different things.\n\n130\n00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.043\nYeah Don.\nI was going to ask about that,\n\n131\n00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:18.007\nbecause we've got a couple\nof MacBook Pros here and\n\n132\n00:06:18.007 --> 00:06:20.882\none of the things I don't see on these,\nand it's kind of interesting, and\n\n133\n00:06:20.882 --> 00:06:22.910\nit seems like a lot of\nthe markets are going this way.\n\n134\n00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.617\nI don't see any optical trays anymore.\n\n135\n00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:25.463\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n136\n00:06:25.463 --> 00:06:26.923\nI mean, If you walk around our office,\n\n137\n00:06:26.923 --> 00:06:29.120\nwe've got a whole mix of\ndifferent things here.\n\n138\n00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.172\nWe've got iMacs, MacBook Pros,\nwe've got Mac Minis, and\n\n139\n00:06:33.172 --> 00:06:35.486\nI can see two Mac Minis over there.\n\n140\n00:06:35.486 --> 00:06:41.400\nAnd I think we might still have one\nMac Mini that has an optical drive in it.\n\n141\n00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.300\nOther than that, there's really\n\n142\n00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.810\nnot any device coming out of Apple\nthese days that has an optical drive.\n\n143\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.906\nAnd by an optical drive I\nmean a CD/DVD drive, and\n\n144\n00:06:50.906 --> 00:06:53.727\nApple calls theirs the SuperDrive, right.\n\n145\n00:06:53.727 --> 00:06:56.830\nIt used to be that if you bought a Macbook\nPro, it had that optical drive in it.\n\n146\n00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.796\nYou could pop a DVD in there.\n\n147\n00:06:58.796 --> 00:07:00.780\nPeople just don't use them anymore.\n\n148\n00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.656\nWe used to like watch movies or\nmake backups, but USB keys, right,\n\n149\n00:07:04.656 --> 00:07:08.872\nlittle flash thumb drives, really\ntook that world by storm; and so now,\n\n150\n00:07:08.872 --> 00:07:12.350\nit's very common for\npeople to have USB keys laying around.\n\n151\n00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.315\nI got one right here.\n\n152\n00:07:13.315 --> 00:07:15.920\nBut I don't know that I\ncould find my DVD drive.\n\n153\n00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.006\nI have one.\nI have an Apple Superdrive.\n\n154\n00:07:18.006 --> 00:07:21.520\nI'm at a loss as to where I put it because\nthat's how long since I've used it.\n\n155\n00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.593\nBut I have one laying around\njust in case I need it.\n\n156\n00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:24.624\nMost people don't.\n\n157\n00:07:24.624 --> 00:07:27.980\nAnd so you're probably not going to see\nCDs and DVDs on your systems anymore.\n\n158\n00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.897\nBut you might.\n\n159\n00:07:28.897 --> 00:07:30.630\nThey are still out there.\n\n160\n00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.080\nJust because your system doesn't have it\nbuilt in doesn't mean you can't add it.\n\n161\n00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.850\nYou can get a USB one to plug in,\nand it'll have a DVD drive in it.\n\n162\n00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.300\nIt's usually a writer also, so\nyou can burn disks as well as read disks.\n\n163\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.553\nSo, those are some of the different\ntypes of storage that are out there.\n\n164\n00:07:44.553 --> 00:07:46.225\nOther ones I mentioned, USB.\n\n165\n00:07:46.225 --> 00:07:49.512\nUSB really common so you can find\nwhere you've got hard drives and\n\n166\n00:07:49.512 --> 00:07:50.820\nstorage like this.\n\n167\n00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:56.116\nThis is a just a 16 gigabyte SSD so I can\npop it on and there's 16 gigs of storage.\n\n168\n00:07:56.116 --> 00:07:57.613\nYou can get bigger ones.\n\n169\n00:07:57.613 --> 00:08:01.704\nOn my desk here I've got a A USB\nattached one that, I guess, yeah,\n\n170\n00:08:01.704 --> 00:08:06.690\nwe can't really see it, but this little\njobbie here, which is a 128 gig SSD.\n\n171\n00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.580\nAnd I've got it plugged\ninto a USB 3.0 port, and so\n\n172\n00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.310\nI get pretty fast access with that,\nand now I've got an extra 128 gigs.\n\n173\n00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.260\nNow, you might recognize that\none from an earlier episode.\n\n174\n00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.860\nI made the El Capitan installer\nout of that drive, so\n\n175\n00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.480\nI could install nice and quickly.\n\n176\n00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.070\nIt's nice to have that, but\n\n177\n00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.400\nit's a little inconvenient, cuz it is an\nextra device that we have to carry around.\n\n178\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.520\nSo it's more ideal to have the storage\ninternally on your system, if you can, but\n\n179\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.180\nit's so expensive, that external drives\nlike these almost become a necessity.\n\n180\n00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.320\nOther things, Thunderbolt, right?\n\n181\n00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.180\nEvery Mac that you buy these days comes\nwith at least one Thunderbolt port on it,\n\n182\n00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.620\nthey normally have two, and\n\n183\n00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.320\nyou can get direct attached drives\nthat have a Thunderbolt connection.\n\n184\n00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.210\nThunderbolt is very fast.\n\n185\n00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.490\nUSB 3.0 is fast,\nThunderbolt is just a little bit faster.\n\n186\n00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.650\nBut I'll tell you guys from\na performance perspective,\n\n187\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.710\nI see this all the time with\nrunning virtual machines.\n\n188\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.920\nI can run virtual machines\noff of a USB 3.0 drive and\n\n189\n00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.137\nit'll run just fine,\nif I'm running one VM.\n\n190\n00:09:04.137 --> 00:09:07.064\nIf I'm running one VM, performance on\na USB 3.0 drive is about the same as\n\n191\n00:09:07.064 --> 00:09:09.590\nperformance on a Thunderbolt drive for me.\n\n192\n00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:14.370\nBut if I start running two or three VMs,\nif I have more than one thing going on at\n\n193\n00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:19.390\na time, the Thunderbolt drive does\nway better than the USB drive.\n\n194\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.100\nThunderbolt just handles simultaneous\nreads and writes, better.\n\n195\n00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.250\nIt's got some kind of better\nchannel architecture,\n\n196\n00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.090\nwhere it's able to handle that.\n\n197\n00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.340\nSo there is a definite\nperformance difference.\n\n198\n00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.230\n>> Would you say maybe, Don,\n\n199\n00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.600\nthat that's probably a little bit closer\nto maybe it runs in full-duplex, so\n\n200\n00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.940\nyou're getting that two-way\ncommunication a little bit better?\n\n201\n00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.482\nOr is it just the way it's built overall?\n\n202\n00:09:35.482 --> 00:09:38.140\nOr both?\n>> They're both full duplex.\n\n203\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.910\nThey just handle addressing differently.\n\n204\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.020\nThey handle how they do their reads and\nwrites differently.\n\n205\n00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.780\nI'm not an engineer, so I don't know\nthe actual difference under the hood.\n\n206\n00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.310\nI just know that it's a noticeable\nperformance difference\n\n207\n00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.340\nbetween the two, based on that.\n\n208\n00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.480\nSo you may see FireWire,\nThunderbolt out there.\n\n209\n00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.650\nYou may see FireWire too,\nit was a slip, but it is out there.\n\n210\n00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.930\nAgain, if you look at Wes's laptop,\nif you look at my laptop, if you look at\n\n211\n00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.740\nthe Mac Mini over there, none of our\ndevices have FireWire ports anymore.\n\n212\n00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.522\nThat was the old hotness, right?\n\n213\n00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:08.810\nThat was the old connector\nthat people loved to get.\n\n214\n00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.987\nIt had 800MB of bandwidth.\n\n215\n00:10:10.987 --> 00:10:14.335\nAnd that was awesome,\ncuz it was way faster than USB 2.0.\n\n216\n00:10:14.335 --> 00:10:18.810\nBut USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt,\nboth kinda killed that off.\n\n217\n00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.210\nAnd so now we don't see FireWire as much,\nbut you might have FireWire drives.\n\n218\n00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.670\nNow the neat thing about FireWire, and\n\n219\n00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.510\nThunderbolt, is that\nit's not just storage.\n\n220\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.290\nI could get a FireWire camera and\nhook it up to my computer.\n\n221\n00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:36.870\nOr I can get a Thunderbolt, I don't know,\nyou don't see scanners all that much.\n\n222\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.395\nBut you can get these different devices,\n\n223\n00:10:38.395 --> 00:10:41.648\nThunderbolt is not\nlimited to just storage.\n\n224\n00:10:41.648 --> 00:10:44.960\nIn fact, Thunderbolt ports\ndouble as display ports, and so\n\n225\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.940\nyou can hook monitors up.\n\n226\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.780\nYou can get Thunderbolt monitors,\nget some 4K action going on, and\n\n227\n00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.970\ndo some neat things there.\n\n228\n00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.320\nSo there's a lot of flexibility\naround those ports, but\n\n229\n00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.750\nwe're talking about\nstorage in this episode.\n\n230\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.080\nSo when you plug it in,\nit just shows up as a hard drive.\n\n231\n00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.520\nThe big thing that we care about,\nis simply performance.\n\n232\n00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.170\nLets see, have I left anything out?\n\n233\n00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:01.790\nLet's see.\n\n234\n00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.330\nYeah, that's pretty much it for\nremovable media.\n\n235\n00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.910\nNow, I'll tell you one of the big\nchallenges you have with removable media,\n\n236\n00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.370\nis when I plug in a USB\ndrive into my system,\n\n237\n00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.450\nI'm gonna need to format it to use it.\n\n238\n00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.390\nAnd on a Mac,\n\n239\n00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:21.000\nwe normally format things as the OS X\nExtended (Journaled) format, right?\n\n240\n00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.520\nThat file format is a really great format,\ndefinitely useful in the Mac world.\n\n241\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.910\nAnd for my internal hard drive, that's\nperfect, that's exactly what I want.\n\n242\n00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.570\nBut for removable media,\n\n243\n00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:35.280\nbecause it's removable,\nI might have it on my Mac today, and\n\n244\n00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.140\nmaybe I copy some diagrams to it and\nsomebody says, can I get a copy of those?\n\n245\n00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.780\nI say, here, just get them right off\nof this key, and I give it to them.\n\n246\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.590\nAnd they're on a Windows machine,\nor they're on a Linux machine.\n\n247\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:51.070\nAre those machines gonna be able to read\nMac OS X, Extended (Journaled) format?\n\n248\n00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.580\nNot out of the box, they're not.\n\n249\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.280\nYou might have third party\nsoftware that can do it, but\n\n250\n00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.820\nout of the box, Windows can't read this.\n\n251\n00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.320\nAnd that's a problem.\n\n252\n00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.520\nSo if I wanna move storage back and\nforth between different operating systems,\n\n253\n00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.570\nI've gotta pick how I\nwanna format that disk.\n\n254\n00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.720\nI've gotta make some decisions\non how I want that formatted,\n\n255\n00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.910\nso that I can share it with other people.\n\n256\n00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.748\nIf I'm just in an all Mac world, then\nthere's only one format you care about,\n\n257\n00:12:14.748 --> 00:12:17.379\nand that's the OS X Extended\n(Journaled) format.\n\n258\n00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:20.038\nBut the other formats are important\nif you're in a mixed world,\n\n259\n00:12:20.038 --> 00:12:22.761\na hybrid environment, and\nyou need to be able to share that data.\n\n260\n00:12:22.761 --> 00:12:27.102\nSo let's talk a little bit about,\nwell actually before I jump into that,\n\n261\n00:12:27.102 --> 00:12:31.110\nthere's a few other concepts that\nwe probably need to understand.\n\n262\n00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.751\nI wanna go through the different file\nformats that are supported by OS X,\n\n263\n00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:37.270\nand kinda,\nwhich ones have different benefits.\n\n264\n00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.880\nBut before I do that,\n\n265\n00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.900\nthere's a few basic concepts that we\nneed to make sure that we understand.\n\n266\n00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.520\nThe main one is, when you're looking at\nyour Mac, if the disk is formatted and\n\n267\n00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.560\nready, it's gonna show up, just maybe on\nyour desktop if you got that turned on, or\n\n268\n00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.161\nit's gonna show up in your volumes folder,\nand you'll be able to see it, right?\n\n269\n00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:57.500\nSo on my laptop, if I browse into,\nlet me get into my finder.\n\n270\n00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.700\nAnd going into my finder,\nI can see where I've got my Macintosh HD.\n\n271\n00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.970\nThat's my internal hard drive.\n\n272\n00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.270\nAnd I've got Install OS X El Capitan.\n\n273\n00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.020\nThat's this USB drive that I've attached.\n\n274\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.600\nI see the two drives.\n\n275\n00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.119\nI've also got Remote Disc,\n\n276\n00:13:12.119 --> 00:13:15.350\nwhich is if I've mapped to\na remote disc somewhere else.\n\n277\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.220\nOr if I plug in a superdrive,\nit would show up here.\n\n278\n00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.910\nAnd then my network drives.\n\n279\n00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:23.260\nNow when I look at these, I don't see\nthings like what file format it is.\n\n280\n00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:28.800\nI don't know if this is OS X Extended\n(Journaled), or Windows NTFS, or whatever.\n\n281\n00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.180\nI don't see that.\n\n282\n00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.240\nI just see that I can use it.\n\n283\n00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.130\nI can browse right in here and\n\n284\n00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:36.280\naccess that data, and there we go,\nit's very, very exciting, right?\n\n285\n00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.260\nSo, what's actually going on in the back\nend, is that when you plug in this device,\n\n286\n00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.490\nyour OS X has to recognize the device.\n\n287\n00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.810\nIt has to have a driver to\nbe able to read the device.\n\n288\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.740\nAnd then it has to\nrecognize the file format.\n\n289\n00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.582\nAnd once it jumps through all those hoops,\nand recognizes all of that,\n\n290\n00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:55.388\nthen it makes it available to us.\n\n291\n00:13:55.388 --> 00:13:58.364\nAnd when it makes available,\nwhat it's actually doing,\n\n292\n00:13:58.364 --> 00:14:00.922\nif I drop to my terminal I\ncan show this to you guys.\n\n293\n00:14:00.922 --> 00:14:05.120\nWhat it's actually doing is mapping\nit to a folder on the drive.\n\n294\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.330\nSo on your hard drive,\nthere's a folder called Volumes.\n\n295\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:13.440\nAnd in that Volumes folder,\nyou'll see all the different hard drives\n\n296\n00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.880\nthat you've got plugged in,\nall the different media.\n\n297\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.040\nAnd they might be local disks.\n\n298\n00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.440\nThey might even be network drives.\n\n299\n00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.920\nThey could be all sorts of things.\n\n300\n00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.000\nSo, I see that install OS X El Capitan.\n\n301\n00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.236\nI see MacIntosh HD, and\nthey're right here, and\n\n302\n00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:28.440\nthey're just folders on my drive.\n\n303\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.500\nSo it doesn't matter to me if it's USB,\nDirect-attached, FireWire, Thunderbolt.\n\n304\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.923\nAt the end of the day,\nthey all show up as just folders, and\n\n305\n00:14:35.923 --> 00:14:37.123\nwe access them the same way.\n\n306\n00:14:37.123 --> 00:14:41.014\n>> Now Don, with file formats,\nwhen you talk about a filing system,\n\n307\n00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:44.560\nare we essentially just talking\nabout a logical structure,\n\n308\n00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.540\nabout how that data is going to be\napplied to wherever it's stored?\n\n309\n00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.456\nAnd then based on the operating system,\n\n310\n00:14:51.456 --> 00:14:57.530\nit's up to the operating system to be\nable recognize that logical structure?\n\n311\n00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.140\n>> That's right.\nAnd that's what we're seeing right here.\n\n312\n00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.720\nThis is that logical\nstructure that I'm seeing.\n\n313\n00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.270\nThe physical side is different.\n\n314\n00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.732\nLet's say we wanna see that physical side,\nright?\n\n315\n00:15:05.732 --> 00:15:07.890\nWe don't really see it here, right?\n\n316\n00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.220\nAll the physical stuff is\nkind of masked from us.\n\n317\n00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.220\nIf I go into system information,\nso I'm gonna go up here to,\n\n318\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.990\nI'll just go to About This Mac.\n\n319\n00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.790\nSo I'll hit my Apple menu,\nhit About This Mac, and in here,\n\n320\n00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.780\nI'm gonna choose the System Report button.\n\n321\n00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.400\nAnd when I go into\nthe System Report button,\n\n322\n00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.740\nhere I get detailed\ninformation about my system.\n\n323\n00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.350\nLet me zoom in on this,\ncuz it's kind of tiny, right?\n\n324\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.275\nWhen you look at it here,\nI have my hardware.\n\n325\n00:15:33.275 --> 00:15:37.366\nAnd the hardware,\nthat's the physical structure, right?\n\n326\n00:15:37.366 --> 00:15:41.590\nSo when I look in here,\nI can see things like ATA, all right?\n\n327\n00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:42.730\nWhat is ATA?\n\n328\n00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.968\nWell, ATA drives are old style parallel,\nnot parallel,\n\n329\n00:15:46.968 --> 00:15:48.610\nno it is, parallel ATA, right?\n\n330\n00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:49.170\n>> It is, yeah.\n>> So\n\n331\n00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.890\nthe original, when they were parallel.\n\n332\n00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.650\nThese are old disks,\nwe don't see these any more.\n\n333\n00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:56.640\nBut you might have an older Mac,\nif you have one of those Let's see,\n\n334\n00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.723\nwhat was a Mac that would've\nhad Parallel ATA in it?\n\n335\n00:15:59.723 --> 00:16:04.200\nCuz Apple used to do SCSI discs in all\ntheir systems, the really old ones.\n\n336\n00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.360\nSo they just, and actually you'll see\nSCSI in here somewhere too I'm sure.\n\n337\n00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.040\nBut.\n\n338\n00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.850\n>> Yep.\nThere you go right there.\n\n339\n00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:09.690\n>> Parallel SCSI.\n\n340\n00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.430\nSo you might have an older\nMac that has those too.\n\n341\n00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.840\nIf you have like, do you remember those\niMacs that came in the different colors?\n\n342\n00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.650\nThey all looked like jelly beans or\nsomething and\n\n343\n00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:18.860\nthose all had SCSI drives in them.\n\n344\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.330\nSo they would show up right here.\n\n345\n00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:25.946\nBut on newer ones you're going to have\nbasically SATA drives, serial ATA.\n\n346\n00:16:25.946 --> 00:16:29.231\nSo, not the old style ATA but the new\nstyle ATA, and if I scroll down and\n\n347\n00:16:29.231 --> 00:16:30.804\nfind SATA, here I've got SATA.\n\n348\n00:16:30.804 --> 00:16:34.380\nAnd sure enough when I click on it\nI've got an Apple SSD controller,\n\n349\n00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.955\nthat's my solid state digital controller,\nand\n\n350\n00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:39.740\nthere's an Apple SSD right here,\na 500 gig one.\n\n351\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:44.300\nThat's the hard drive that's internal\nto my laptop, that's what I've got.\n\n352\n00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.930\nNow, I don't see my external drive.\n\n353\n00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:52.570\nMy external drive is an SSD, but\nit's not plugged into the SSD controller.\n\n354\n00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.037\nI've got it plugged into USB.\n\n355\n00:16:54.037 --> 00:16:59.498\nAnd so if I look over here and find USB,\nhere it is, and here's my USB 3.0 Bus.\n\n356\n00:16:59.498 --> 00:17:01.667\nAnd there's an ASMT1051,\n\n357\n00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:06.730\nthat's the USB 3.0 adaptor I've\ngot running to that hard drive.\n\n358\n00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:09.190\nAnd so the hard drive is\nplugged in to that device.\n\n359\n00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:10.470\nThat's it showing up right there.\n\n360\n00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:14.320\nAnd we've got other things, like my\ninternal keyboard, and host controller,\n\n361\n00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.190\nwhich is my other port here that's empty.\n\n362\n00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.900\nBut as I plug in USB devices,\n\n363\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.120\nthey'll show up here, and\nthat's where they're plugged in.\n\n364\n00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.144\nAnd you'll see other things like if\nI had Thunderbolt devices plugged in,\n\n365\n00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:26.160\nwhich I don't have any right now.\n\n366\n00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.020\nI just lied I have my gigabit ethernet\nadaptor I forgot about that thing.\n\n367\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.400\nRemember when I said Thunderbolt can\ndo a lot more than just storage.\n\n368\n00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.460\nI've got my network adaptor plugged into\nit so I can see what's plugged into that.\n\n369\n00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:42.750\nParallel SCSI, we talked about\nserial attached SCSI is another one.\n\n370\n00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:47.250\nThese are all different types of storage\nthat you're not likely to have, right?\n\n371\n00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:52.580\nMost of your current Macs are all going\nto have SATA, Serial Attached ATA.\n\n372\n00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.530\nAnd this is gonna give you\nkind of the best connectivity.\n\n373\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:57.910\nSo I'm seeing an SSD on this one.\n\n374\n00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.890\nLet me switch over to\nanother system like this one.\n\n375\n00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.470\nAnd this one doesn't have SSD,\nthis one just has a regular disk cuz it's\n\n376\n00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:11.026\na virtual machine, and so if I go into my\nabout this Mac and into my system report.\n\n377\n00:18:11.026 --> 00:18:17.690\nOn this one if I go into SATA, yes,\nit shows a SATA disk but not an SSD.\n\n378\n00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.520\nSo what I'm gonna see when I\nlook in here is just a bunch of\n\n379\n00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.130\ngeneric controllers cuz\nthat's what VMWare makes.\n\n380\n00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.640\nAnd here's that virtual SATA hard drive.\n\n381\n00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.965\nWell, if I were on a Mac Mini or something\nthat didn't have SSD, I would see\n\n382\n00:18:28.965 --> 00:18:32.970\nits hard drive here and it would just\nshow up as an HDD instead of an SSD.\n\n383\n00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.900\nAnd so\nyou'd see that kind of connectivity.\n\n384\n00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.950\nSo, just an easy way to jump in and\nsee that hardware side of things,\n\n385\n00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.420\nthe system information screen it's\nfull of a lot of valuable data.\n\n386\n00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:47.100\nBecause you might plug a drive in,\nand the drive never shows up.\n\n387\n00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.480\nI can't get to it.\n\n388\n00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.640\nWell did your system even\nrecognize the disk was plugged in?\n\n389\n00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.870\nIt may not have.\n\n390\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.530\nSo you can go into here and see.\n\n391\n00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.040\nDid it even recognize\nthe disk was plugged in?\n\n392\n00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.000\nIt could be the disk is completely blank.\n\n393\n00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.980\nIf you just bought a brand new hard\ndrive and it's completely blank,\n\n394\n00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.015\nyou plug it in, there's nothing for\nthe system to mount.\n\n395\n00:19:06.015 --> 00:19:08.420\nIt sees the hardware but\nthere's nothing for it to do with it.\n\n396\n00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.740\nAnd so coming into the system\ninformation will let you see that.\n\n397\n00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.560\nI can see the hardware is plugged in,\nall right.\n\n398\n00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.840\nNow [COUGH] each of the different\ndevices will show up in there and\n\n399\n00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.740\nwhere it starts to get confusing\nis that there's really\n\n400\n00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.710\nthree things that happen when\nyou plug a disk in, right?\n\n401\n00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.510\nWe've got the disk itself and\nApple calls that the physical disk.\n\n402\n00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.930\nSo, for example, my internal SSD,\nthat's a physical disk.\n\n403\n00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.410\nIt's a drive and odds are it's actually a\nchip that's soldered onto the motherboard,\n\n404\n00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.170\nI can't pop it out.\n\n405\n00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.970\nBut some of them are like this little\none that I've got plugged in where\n\n406\n00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.170\nI can hold it in my hand.\n\n407\n00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:40.730\nIt's right here.\n\n408\n00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.250\nI can move it from system to system,\n\n409\n00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.620\nothers are soldered onto the motherboard,\nand that's it.\n\n410\n00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.330\nAnd that's how you're starting to see\na lot of the, all the new Mac Minis,\n\n411\n00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.480\nit's soldered right onto the motherboard.\n\n412\n00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.190\nBut, so that's the physical disk,\nthat's the first part.\n\n413\n00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:58.710\nAnd then we plug that in and\non the disk will be one or\n\n414\n00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:04.690\nmore partitions, and what a partition is,\nis a usable space on the disk.\n\n415\n00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.380\nSo normally you take a disk, and\nlet's say it's a 128 gig disk, and\n\n416\n00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:11.740\nyou create a partition\non it that's 128 gigs.\n\n417\n00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.290\nAnd so that's this useable space\non the drive that I can now use.\n\n418\n00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.030\nBut if you watched our installation\nepisode you know we can have more than\n\n419\n00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:18.650\none partition.\n\n420\n00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.200\nIn fact in OS X you can up to 16.\n\n421\n00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.150\nI can create multiple partitions\nto divide my data up.\n\n422\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:29.470\nSo maybe I have a terabyte drive and\nI wanna divide it in half,\n\n423\n00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:30.390\ninto two 500-gig drives.\n\n424\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.310\nAll right, now,\nI did that in the installation episode so\n\n425\n00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.180\nyou guys could jump back and\nwatch those if you want.\n\n426\n00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.570\nBut you might also wanna do\nsomething like Boot Camp.\n\n427\n00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.820\nI wanna have Windows on this\nsystem as well as Apple.\n\n428\n00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.410\nSo I divide the drive in half.\n\n429\n00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.230\nIt doesn't give you any performance\nimprovements, it doesn't, you know,\n\n430\n00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.660\nmake the disk more reliable or\nanything like that.\n\n431\n00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.920\nIt just separates data,\nit's for organization, right.\n\n432\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.530\nIt kinda helps to isolate information.\n\n433\n00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.510\nSo, that's the second part,\nis the partition.\n\n434\n00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.630\nNow the partition is usable space.\n\n435\n00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.650\nBut the system can't actually use it,\nuntil it has a file system on it, right?\n\n436\n00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.100\nAnd what is a file system?\n\n437\n00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.750\nWell I've already mentioned one,\nOS X Extended Journal, right?\n\n438\n00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.110\nWhat does that mean?\n\n439\n00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.690\nWell that's a file system.\n\n440\n00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:11.870\nWhen I store a file on a hard drive,\nit's a series of ones and\n\n441\n00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.700\nzeroes, you're writing ones and\nzeroes to that drive.\n\n442\n00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.210\nSo, when you go to retrieve a file,\nhow do you find that?\n\n443\n00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.560\nIf you're just looking at a giant\ndisk full of ones and zeros,\n\n444\n00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.820\nhow do you find the right ones and zeros?\n\n445\n00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.550\nWhere do I know where my file starts or\nwhere my file stops?\n\n446\n00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:30.460\nSo if I ask the computer,\nhey can you give me a copy of resume.txt,\n\n447\n00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.540\nright, I'm in a hurry,\ngive me my resume fast, right.\n\n448\n00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.952\nSo [LAUGH] we've had a, what is it,\na career altering event?\n\n449\n00:21:36.952 --> 00:21:40.650\nSo [LAUGH] I reach out to\nthe hard drive to get that data.\n\n450\n00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.200\nWell, I'm telling the system\nI want this file name.\n\n451\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.970\nHow the heck does it know where\nthe ones and zeroes for that file are?\n\n452\n00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.850\nIt's the file system that does that.\n\n453\n00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.710\nThe file system says I'm gonna\nstore this name with an index and\n\n454\n00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:57.720\nthe index is gonna say read from this\nsector all the way from this other sector,\n\n455\n00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.900\nthat's where you're\ngoing to find that file.\n\n456\n00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:04.190\nWell, different companies do\nthat file system different ways.\n\n457\n00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:08.390\nSo like, back in the 1970s, Microsoft\nstarted to create this file system called\n\n458\n00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.730\nFAT, the File Allocation Table.\n\n459\n00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.630\nAnd what it did is it created a little\nfile table at the very beginning of\n\n460\n00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:18.300\nthe disk, and in that file table they\nwould store the names of files, and\n\n461\n00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.870\nthe names of folders, and\n\n462\n00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:23.220\nthen little pointers to where on the hard\ndrive you can go to access that data.\n\n463\n00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.243\nAnd it worked pretty well.\n\n464\n00:22:25.243 --> 00:22:27.577\nIt's a very standard system\nthat a lot of people use today.\n\n465\n00:22:27.577 --> 00:22:32.300\nBut it's extremely dated, it's very\nfragile, it's very easy to break it.\n\n466\n00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.630\nAnd so you're not gonna see\nFile Allocation Table very often anymore.\n\n467\n00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.980\nBut every other vendor\ndoes something similar.\n\n468\n00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.070\nAnd Apple, Apple actually used\nthe file allocation table for\n\n469\n00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.510\na while before they started\ncreating their own.\n\n470\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:48.220\nThey started creating their own file\nsystems to do things a little bit better.\n\n471\n00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:54.430\nAnd on all of your modern Macs, you're\nnow seeing the OS X extended file system.\n\n472\n00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.900\nAnd the extended file system is\nproprietary to Apple, they made it,\n\n473\n00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.480\nit's their own little thing,\nand it's very good.\n\n474\n00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.290\nIt's got a lot of neat little bells and\nwhistles.\n\n475\n00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.500\nAnd so we're gonna talk about\nthat file system later on.\n\n476\n00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.670\nBut understand that Unix systems,\nMacs, Windows,\n\n477\n00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.510\nLinux, they've all got different\nfile systems that are supported.\n\n478\n00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:17.070\nAnd so, when you create that partition,\nyou've got to format it and\n\n479\n00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.500\nput a file system on it.\n\n480\n00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.540\nThat's what formatting is,\n\n481\n00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:24.060\nyou're putting a file system on that disk,\nand now I can start to use it.\n\n482\n00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.230\nSo in order for a disk to work I've\ngotta recognize the physical hardware.\n\n483\n00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.550\nI've gotta recognize the partition.\n\n484\n00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.660\nAnd I've gotta recognize\nthe file system on it.\n\n485\n00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.560\nAnd only when all three things are done\nwill I see it in my volumes folder and\n\n486\n00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.590\nI'm ready to use it.\n\n487\n00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:42.200\nSo it's important to understand\nthose three pieces that are going on\n\n488\n00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.810\nunder the hood, all right?\n\n489\n00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:45.270\nNow on the physical hardware, that's easy.\n\n490\n00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.010\nYou plug it in.\n\n491\n00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.980\nYou either have a driver for\nit or you don't.\n\n492\n00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.040\nIf it's USB or SATA stuff,\nyou've already got that.\n\n493\n00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.180\nIt's gonna work fine.\n\n494\n00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:54.721\nIf it's some crazy new proprietary thing,\nyou might have to load drivers for it.\n\n495\n00:23:54.721 --> 00:23:57.570\nBut storage is usually not\nproprietary on the hardware side.\n\n496\n00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.061\nStep two is the partition.\n\n497\n00:24:00.061 --> 00:24:02.164\nHow do we recognize the partition?\n\n498\n00:24:02.164 --> 00:24:05.673\nWell when you add a disc and\nyou create a partition on it,\n\n499\n00:24:05.673 --> 00:24:10.007\nyou have to pick what kind of partition\ntable you're going to have and\n\n500\n00:24:10.007 --> 00:24:13.760\nthere's three main types that\nwe need to know for the exam.\n\n501\n00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.670\nIn real life,\nthere's only one that we care about, but\n\n502\n00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.750\nthere's three main ones\nthat show up on the exam.\n\n503\n00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:22.010\nThe one that we care about, the one\nthat we're gonna use is called GPT.\n\n504\n00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.830\nGPT is the GUID partition table.\n\n505\n00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.850\nAnd GUID, I know an acronym within\nan acronym, stands for global unique\n\n506\n00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:34.820\nidentifier, so it's the globally\nunique identifier partition table.\n\n507\n00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.950\nIt's a way of listing how many partitions\nyou have and where they start,\n\n508\n00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:39.600\nwhere they stop, what their names are,\n\n509\n00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.680\nall the information about the partitions\nstored in a very standard format.\n\n510\n00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.552\nGPT is supported by Apple,\nMicrosoft, Linux,\n\n511\n00:24:46.552 --> 00:24:50.413\npretty much every operating system\nout there can recognize GPT.\n\n512\n00:24:50.413 --> 00:24:53.815\nSo if I take a GPT disk and I plug it\ninto a system, it's gonna recognize\n\n513\n00:24:53.815 --> 00:24:57.176\nthe hardware, and then it's gonna\nrecognize the partition table.\n\n514\n00:24:57.176 --> 00:24:59.710\nThe first two things we need to recognize,\nright?\n\n515\n00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:04.040\nSo GPT is what you wanna use,\nbut there's two others, right?\n\n516\n00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.550\nThere's another one called APM.\n\n517\n00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:12.340\nAnd APM that's the Apple Partition Map and\nthat was used on old Macs.\n\n518\n00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.890\nIf you had a Mac, that was a PowerPC Mac\nnot an Intel processor, so\n\n519\n00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.400\nwe're talking ten years ago.\n\n520\n00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:22.520\nIf you had one that was a PowerPC, it\nmore than likely used APM for it's disks.\n\n521\n00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.700\nApple can still recognize those and\nread them, but it's Apple proprietary,\n\n522\n00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.660\nnobody else can.\n\n523\n00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.210\nYou plug that into a Windows machine or\na Linux machine they'll\n\n524\n00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.930\nrecognize the hardware they won't\nrecognize the partition app.\n\n525\n00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.709\nIn fact, they'll usually\nthink the disk is empty and\n\n526\n00:25:34.709 --> 00:25:38.062\nask to format it and\nthat's probably not what you want, right?\n\n527\n00:25:38.062 --> 00:25:39.692\nSo APM that's old school, but\n\n528\n00:25:39.692 --> 00:25:43.340\nmaybe if you're dealing with some\nreally old stuff you might see it.\n\n529\n00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.450\nThen the third one\nthat's out there is MBR.\n\n530\n00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.050\nMBR is Master Boot Record.\n\n531\n00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.489\nMaster boot record was the one\nthat Microsoft created.\n\n532\n00:25:50.489 --> 00:25:54.650\nAnd it was designed so that the hard\ndrives could have this well, boot record\n\n533\n00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:59.153\nthat would identify what partitions were\nout there and which ones were bootable.\n\n534\n00:25:59.153 --> 00:26:01.898\nAnd that one is supported by Mac,\nWindows, Linux.\n\n535\n00:26:01.898 --> 00:26:05.788\nIt’s supported by everybody, but it has\nsome limitations because it was created 30\n\n536\n00:26:05.788 --> 00:26:08.879\nyears ago, and so it doesn't support\nreally, really big drives and\n\n537\n00:26:08.879 --> 00:26:11.140\nit doesn't support a high\nnumber of partitions.\n\n538\n00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.820\nReally only supports four partitions,\nso it has limitations and\n\n539\n00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.820\nthat's why GPT came about.\n\n540\n00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.850\nAnd James in the chat room make\na good comment there about how\n\n541\n00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:23.310\nGPT is kind of supported by UFI.\n\n542\n00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.600\nUFI is the new BIOS replacement\nthat most systems use,\n\n543\n00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.990\nincluding all new Macs, and that's why\nthey had to get that standardized system.\n\n544\n00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:34.594\nSo that's why I say GPT is the only one I\ncare about that's because all Macs are UFI\n\n545\n00:26:34.594 --> 00:26:38.370\nthese days and that's the one they want,\nbut same thing goes for Windows and Linux.\n\n546\n00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.310\nGPT's really the one we're\ngoing to stick with.\n\n547\n00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:45.060\n>> Now Don, you have mentioned that\nMBR does have some limitations.\n\n548\n00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.380\nIt's been around for a long while.\n\n549\n00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:52.273\nCan you tell us a little bit about what\nmakes maybe the GUI partitioning scheme\n\n550\n00:26:52.273 --> 00:26:54.164\na little bit better than MBR?\n\n551\n00:26:54.164 --> 00:26:54.941\n>> It's magic, Wes.\n\n552\n00:26:54.941 --> 00:26:55.569\n>> It's magic?\n\n553\n00:26:55.569 --> 00:26:56.172\n>> It's magic.\n\n554\n00:26:56.172 --> 00:26:57.330\nGPT's magic.\n\n555\n00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.330\nWell it's not so bad.\n\n556\n00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.574\nGPT uses a much larger address space, so\n\n557\n00:27:01.574 --> 00:27:04.352\nit can recognize partitions\nthat are far larger.\n\n558\n00:27:04.352 --> 00:27:07.785\nAnd I don't know the maximum\nsize off the top of my head, but\n\n559\n00:27:07.785 --> 00:27:11.849\nit's something like 8 is it zetabytes or\nsomething crazy like that?\n\n560\n00:27:11.849 --> 00:27:12.429\n>> Yeah.\n\n561\n00:27:12.429 --> 00:27:15.129\n>> Some unit of measure that none of\nus will ever have to deal with for\n\n562\n00:27:15.129 --> 00:27:16.160\n100 years, right?\n\n563\n00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.570\nBut it can recognize massive disks.\n\n564\n00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.750\nIt can also recognize massive\namounts of partitions.\n\n565\n00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.650\nIn fact, remember earlier I said Apple,\nyou can go up to16 partitions?\n\n566\n00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.540\nWell, that's an artificial\nlimit that Apple puts in there.\n\n567\n00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.280\nThere's people who are using GPT\ndisks to have far more than that.\n\n568\n00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.830\nNow the reality is if you've\ngot more than three partitions,\n\n569\n00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.360\nyou probably need to evaluate\nyour use case scenario.\n\n570\n00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.410\nMost people don't do that.\n\n571\n00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:40.740\nIt's normally,\nthree would really be probably the tops.\n\n572\n00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.300\nIf you have Boot Camp,\nyou probably have three.\n\n573\n00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.540\nEven on a standard Mac where you\nthink you just have one partition,\n\n574\n00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.630\nyou actually have two.\n\n575\n00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:48.860\nBecause when you boot UEFI,\n\n576\n00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.840\nyou're going to have your main partition\nwhere all of your data is, and\n\n577\n00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.770\nthen you're gonna have a small like 200 MB\npartition that's there for the UEFI boot.\n\n578\n00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:02.930\nAnd that one it's normally formatted\nas FAT32, the file allocation table.\n\n579\n00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.140\nSo even on a Mac, you still have some\nfile allocation table laying around and\n\n580\n00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.900\nthat's to help your system boot, and\nso that's two partitions, right?\n\n581\n00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.047\nAnd then if you do something like\nBootcamp, or just divide out data,\n\n582\n00:28:12.047 --> 00:28:14.149\nthen you might end up\nwith three partitions.\n\n583\n00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:15.580\nIf you've got four or more,\n\n584\n00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.760\nyou really do have to evaluate that,\nso 16 is more than enough.\n\n585\n00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.960\nBut that's really the part about it where\nGPT is just the modern forward thing.\n\n586\n00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.910\nIt's got a much better support for\ncurrent hardware as well as UEFI and\n\n587\n00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.290\nits security layer, so\nthat's the one that we want, all right?\n\n588\n00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:35.130\nNow when I plug in a hard drive,\nI have to make sure that my system\n\n589\n00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.610\nrecognizes that partition table or\nI'm not gonna able to read the disk.\n\n590\n00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.250\nNow how do I know if that's happening?\n\n591\n00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.200\nWell let me take my computer here and\nI'll show you.\n\n592\n00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.021\nI'm gonna bring up the disk utility and\nin the Disk Utility.\n\n593\n00:28:45.021 --> 00:28:51.190\nAnd in the Disk Utility, notice how\nall of my disks show up twice, right?\n\n594\n00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.990\nI've got the Apple SSD and\nthen Macintosh HD.\n\n595\n00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:59.860\nI've got the ASMT2115, and then I've\ngot Install OS 10 Yosemite, right?\n\n596\n00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.400\nSo all of my discs,\nit's not gonna let me resize that?\n\n597\n00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.390\nApparently I'm not asking nice enough.\n\n598\n00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.140\nSo all of my discs show up twice.\n\n599\n00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.140\nWhy is that?\n\n600\n00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.990\nWell the first one, that's the hardware\nthat's my system saying that yes,\n\n601\n00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.300\nI recognize that there is a physical\nhard drive on this system\n\n602\n00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:21.120\neither internal like this one or\nexternal like this one, right?\n\n603\n00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.160\nSo that was the first of\nthe three things,right?\n\n604\n00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.760\nRecognize the physical disk.\n\n605\n00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.140\nThe second thing was the partition table,\nand so\n\n606\n00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:31.490\nwhen I click on this disk,\nI'm seeing the partition table, right?\n\n607\n00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:35.390\nWell sort of, I'm seeing what\nApple's allowing me to see.\n\n608\n00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.880\nIt's letting me see\nthere's a 500 gig disk and\n\n609\n00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.180\nthat the entire thing is blue\nbecause I haven't divided this up.\n\n610\n00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.225\nIt's not a hybrid or anything like that.\n\n611\n00:29:43.225 --> 00:29:44.141\nIt's just one big disk.\n\n612\n00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:48.830\nAnd if I look right down here,\nI can see the partition map.\n\n613\n00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:52.050\nAnd see how the partition map\nshows is GUID Partition Map?\n\n614\n00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:59.900\nSo this is a disk that is done\nwith GPT and it's ready to go.\n\n615\n00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:04.880\nIf I look at my external disk and I click\non it, I can see that it's external.\n\n616\n00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:10.170\nIt's USB and it's also GPT or\nGUID Partition Map, so it's\n\n617\n00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:14.670\nalready set up to use that partition type\nand I recognize that and I'm good to go.\n\n618\n00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.490\nThat was the second requirement.\n\n619\n00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:19.960\nWell if I plug in a truly blank disc,\n\n620\n00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.430\nusually when you buy a disc, it's\nalready got some kind of format on it.\n\n621\n00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:28.133\nBut if I buy a truly blank disc, when I\nplug it in, the Mac is gonna ask me to\n\n622\n00:30:28.133 --> 00:30:32.555\ninitialize it and initializing is\nputting a partition table on it.\n\n623\n00:30:32.555 --> 00:30:34.759\nAnd when we put that partition table on,\nyou actually do have choices.\n\n624\n00:30:34.759 --> 00:30:35.481\nLet me show you.\n\n625\n00:30:35.481 --> 00:30:40.136\nI'll take my external disc here and\nif I choose the Partition button up top,\n\n626\n00:30:40.136 --> 00:30:45.060\nI'm gonna partition it and it's gonna\nask me some basic information here.\n\n627\n00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.970\nAnd see how the scheme is\ndefaulting to GUID Partition Map?\n\n628\n00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.248\nIt's gonna force me to\ndo GUID partition map.\n\n629\n00:30:51.248 --> 00:30:56.760\nWell on older, you actually get a choice.\n\n630\n00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.590\nEven in Yosemite, I think you still had\nthe choice where you could pick and\n\n631\n00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.970\nyou could partition it\nas something different.\n\n632\n00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:06.680\nRight now, I'm choosing OS10 Extended\nJournaled, which requires GPT.\n\n633\n00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.810\nIf I were to switch to some other format\nthough, it might not require that and\n\n634\n00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.320\nI may be able to choose\na different partition map.\n\n635\n00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.090\nIn In El Capitan,\nthey simplify the disk utility though, so\n\n636\n00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.910\nI'm not gonna see it here.\n\n637\n00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:21.710\nI would have to drop down to the command\nline and use the diskutil command\n\n638\n00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.790\nto apply a different partition map, but\nthat's where it's going to apply it.\n\n639\n00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:28.210\nIf I'm initializing a brand new disk,\nwhether I do 1 partition or\n\n640\n00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.580\n5 partitions or 20 partitions,\nit's not gonna matter.\n\n641\n00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.780\nIt's gonna create that partition map for\nme, right?\n\n642\n00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.070\nSo that's the main one\nthat we see right there.\n\n643\n00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.850\nThe format that's the next\ndecision I have to make and\n\n644\n00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.160\nthere's a lot of choices there.\n\n645\n00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.780\nAnd I wanna go through each of these and\nkind of talk about what they are and\n\n646\n00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.580\nwhat they do, but\nI know I'm pushing my limits here.\n\n647\n00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.740\nWes is giving me the evil eye.\n\n648\n00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.440\nSo Wes, what do you think about\ndoing a part two on this one?\n\n649\n00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.220\n>> Yeah, I think we're gonna have to\nbecause it does look like we're coming to\n\n650\n00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.800\nthe end of another not an episode, but\nour time is a little constrained on us.\n\n651\n00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.836\nSo Don, do you have anything else for\nus in this episode?\n\n652\n00:31:58.836 --> 00:32:02.339\n>> All right, just remember the key thing\nto take away here are the three pieces to\n\n653\n00:32:02.339 --> 00:32:03.360\nrecognize the drive.\n\n654\n00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.740\nWe have to recognize the physical disk, we\nhave to recognize the partition table and\n\n655\n00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.780\nwe've got to recognize the format.\n\n656\n00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.420\nWe're gonna see that format in part two,\nall right?\n\n657\n00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.320\n>> Well thank you for that, Don and thank\nyou for you guys out there watching us,\n\n658\n00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.580\nbut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n659\n00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.050\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n660\n00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:17.945\n>> And I'm Don Pizet.\n\n661\n00:32:17.945 --> 00:32:20.210\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n662\n00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:27.020\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.657\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.657 --> 00:00:21.267\nwe're actually coming back with\na part two of our file storage.\n\n5\n00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:23.825\nAnd we've gotten none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet to help us out.\n\n6\n00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:24.986\nDon, how you doing, and welcome back sir.\n\n7\n00:00:24.986 --> 00:00:26.123\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:26.123 --> 00:00:29.166\nThanks for having me back, and,\nyeah, I ramble on a little too long.\n\n9\n00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.689\nBut we talked about some really\nimportant stuff in the last episode.\n\n10\n00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.747\nWe talked about the three things\nthat we've got to have in order for\n\n11\n00:00:34.747 --> 00:00:36.286\nMac OS to recognize a hard drive.\n\n12\n00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:39.482\nWe talked about recognizing the physical\nhardware which is pretty straightforward.\n\n13\n00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:44.154\nWe talked about the partition table, which\nthese days is pretty much GPT everywhere.\n\n14\n00:00:44.154 --> 00:00:46.878\nBut we talked about some of\nthe other ones that were out there.\n\n15\n00:00:46.878 --> 00:00:48.456\nWe didn't get to the third piece.\n\n16\n00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:51.951\nThe third piece was having\na partition is not enough.\n\n17\n00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.491\nWe've gotta know how to put files into it,\nand\n\n18\n00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:56.783\nit's the file system that tells us that.\n\n19\n00:00:56.783 --> 00:00:58.234\nAnd so, the third piece for\n\n20\n00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:02.770\nus to recognize the drive is to have\na file system that is recognized by OS X.\n\n21\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.920\nNow, there's several different\nfile systems that are supported.\n\n22\n00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.788\nSome of them are read-only,\nsome are read-write.\n\n23\n00:01:10.788 --> 00:01:12.762\nThe read-write ones we see really easy.\n\n24\n00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:15.073\nYou can format your disk and\nstart using it right away.\n\n25\n00:01:15.073 --> 00:01:17.233\nOther ones we can only read.\n\n26\n00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:20.309\nSo some of them aren't immediately obvious\nand I wanna kinda run through those and\n\n27\n00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:21.970\ngive you guys an idea of what's available.\n\n28\n00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.329\nAnd so I'm gonna pick right back up\nwhere we left off in the last episode,\n\n29\n00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.908\nwhich was I had gone into the disk utility\non my system and we looked at a disk and\n\n30\n00:01:28.908 --> 00:01:30.750\nI showed you guys the partition table.\n\n31\n00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.921\nAnd now it's time to format out that disk.\n\n32\n00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:36.151\nSo let's take a look at this.\n\n33\n00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:39.897\nI'm gonna go right back in to disk utility\nand I'll just take my external SSD here.\n\n34\n00:01:39.897 --> 00:01:43.707\nRight now I've got the OS X\ninstaller on it right, so\n\n35\n00:01:43.707 --> 00:01:46.054\nwe used it back in that episode.\n\n36\n00:01:46.054 --> 00:01:49.434\nSo it's got one big fat partition\non it that's 128 gigs and\n\n37\n00:01:49.434 --> 00:01:54.250\nthe data is all there and it's formatted\nhowever it's formatted, right?\n\n38\n00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.390\nBut if I want to change that.\n\n39\n00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.636\nIf I wanna format that disk and\nrestructure it, rearrange it,\n\n40\n00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:04.254\nchose whatever I want,\nI can go up here to partition.\n\n41\n00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:08.455\nAnd in the partition menu, I can start\nto do, well, a few different things.\n\n42\n00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:10.860\nI might want to just format,\nand keep it one partition.\n\n43\n00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.480\nSo maybe I want this to be some\nkind of storage hard drive, right?\n\n44\n00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.069\nSo I might want to call it storage HD.\n\n45\n00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.828\nAnd then I can pick from my formats.\n\n46\n00:02:19.828 --> 00:02:24.360\nAnd if you look, I've got six different\nformats that I can pick form.\n\n47\n00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.424\nThese are all the formats\nthat OS X can read and write.\n\n48\n00:02:29.424 --> 00:02:31.409\nWe can read and\nwrite all six of these formats.\n\n49\n00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.827\nBut there's another three or\nfour that we can just read and\n\n50\n00:02:34.827 --> 00:02:37.288\nthey don't show up in this list, right?\n\n51\n00:02:37.288 --> 00:02:40.063\nSo that's where I say that there are some\nthat are not immediately obvious, and\n\n52\n00:02:40.063 --> 00:02:41.857\nwe need to be familiar with\nall of them for the exam.\n\n53\n00:02:41.857 --> 00:02:43.540\nNow as you look at the, I say there's six.\n\n54\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.321\nThere's really just three, right?\n\n55\n00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:49.676\nWe have the OS X Extended,\nand we have MS-DOS (FAT) and\n\n56\n00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:52.139\nExFAT, and that's really it.\n\n57\n00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.151\nWe have four different variations\nof OS X extended though, and\n\n58\n00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:59.580\nthe very first one is the default one for\nMac OS.\n\n59\n00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.140\nSo if you go and buy a Mac from Apple and\nyou crack it open out of the box,\n\n60\n00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.600\nyou plug it in, and fire it up,\n\n61\n00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.335\nthe hard drive is gonna be formatted with\nthis first one, OS X Extended Journaled.\n\n62\n00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:10.139\nThat’s their proprietary format.\n\n63\n00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.775\nDon, I've noticed that in parentheses\nthere, you've got a couple of options,\n\n64\n00:03:13.775 --> 00:03:15.210\nlike for instance encryption.\n\n65\n00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.634\nAnd encryption's kinda obvious,\nbut what I don't understand is,\n\n66\n00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:20.000\nwhat does journaled mean?\n\n67\n00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.643\n>> All right, so\n\n68\n00:03:20.643 --> 00:03:23.818\neach one of these are just slight\nvariations of the features, right?\n\n69\n00:03:23.818 --> 00:03:27.570\nSo if we look at that list I've got\nfour different OS X Extended, right.\n\n70\n00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.737\nSo, you've got the basic OS X Extended,\nwhich you don't really have here.\n\n71\n00:03:31.737 --> 00:03:32.574\nThere's no one.\n\n72\n00:03:32.574 --> 00:03:33.792\nYou can use just the basic.\n\n73\n00:03:33.792 --> 00:03:37.661\nBut the basic one gives us a file\nformat that we can store files in\n\n74\n00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:38.764\nthe file system.\n\n75\n00:03:38.764 --> 00:03:41.036\nIt gives us the ability to\ndo file permissions, so\n\n76\n00:03:41.036 --> 00:03:42.397\nwe have that functionality.\n\n77\n00:03:42.397 --> 00:03:43.617\nIt helps us define stuff.\n\n78\n00:03:43.617 --> 00:03:47.399\nIt gives us Unicode file names so\nwe can have international characters for\n\n79\n00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:48.254\nour file names.\n\n80\n00:03:48.254 --> 00:03:49.380\nSo you get that basic support.\n\n81\n00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.692\nThat's included in all of them.\n\n82\n00:03:50.692 --> 00:03:51.936\nI feel like a car salesman.\n\n83\n00:03:51.936 --> 00:03:53.468\nThat's in the base package.\n\n84\n00:03:53.468 --> 00:03:55.800\nBut if you go with the LX, you get this.\n\n85\n00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.102\nAnd that's how these other ones are.\n\n86\n00:03:57.102 --> 00:04:01.512\nWe're picking what extra features we want,\nand there's really three features here,\n\n87\n00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:03.904\ncase sensitive, journaled, and encrypted.\n\n88\n00:04:03.904 --> 00:04:06.730\nAnd like you said Wes,\nencrypted that’s pretty easy.\n\n89\n00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.640\nIt's gonna be an encrypted drive, and\nwe probably want that anyway, but\n\n90\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.490\nwe usually use File Vault to manage it as\nopposed to formatting in encrypted here.\n\n91\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.598\nBut we can encrypt the drive for extra\nsecurity in case somebody steals the hard\n\n92\n00:04:17.598 --> 00:04:19.164\ndrive and puts it in another computer.\n\n93\n00:04:19.164 --> 00:04:24.596\nCase-sensitive, well that means\nthe file names are case-sensitive,\n\n94\n00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:27.669\nand that's a very UNIX-like behavior.\n\n95\n00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.138\nNotice that the default\nhere is not that way.\n\n96\n00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:35.164\nBut if I format it K sensitive, now when\nI create file names whether the letters\n\n97\n00:04:35.164 --> 00:04:37.548\nare capital or\nlowercase makes a difference.\n\n98\n00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:40.290\nNow I'll show you an example\nof that here in just a moment.\n\n99\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.670\nAnd then Journaled.\n\n100\n00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.730\nJournaled is really the best\nfeature of OS X Extended.\n\n101\n00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.550\nWhat Journaling says is hey,\nif I'm writing to a file,\n\n102\n00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.014\nand let's say it's\na removable disk like mine.\n\n103\n00:04:53.014 --> 00:04:57.394\nAnd I'm writing to a file, I'm halfway\nthrough the write, and I unplug the drive,\n\n104\n00:04:57.394 --> 00:04:59.400\nor I lose power or whatever.\n\n105\n00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.000\nWhat happens to my data?\n\n106\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.343\nWell the odds are my data's corrupt.\n\n107\n00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:06.000\nI was halfway through writing to it and\nwe cut it, so I've got my half my data.\n\n108\n00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.277\nAnd what good is half data?\n\n109\n00:05:07.277 --> 00:05:08.219\nIt's not good at all.\n\n110\n00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.052\nIt's corrupted data, and I've now lost it.\n\n111\n00:05:10.052 --> 00:05:14.468\nBut what journaling does is it says when\nyou write to the disc, if you're updating\n\n112\n00:05:14.468 --> 00:05:18.540\nan existing file, if you're writing\na new file, you just write it.\n\n113\n00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.570\nBut if you're updating an existing file,\nyou don't overwrite the existing file.\n\n114\n00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.658\nYou write an all new file.\n\n115\n00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.872\nAnd to the end user,\nit looks just like the one file, but\n\n116\n00:05:26.872 --> 00:05:29.290\nin reality it's writing\nit to a different place.\n\n117\n00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:35.017\nAnd when it gets to 100% done, then it can\ngo, and it can remove the old file, right?\n\n118\n00:05:35.017 --> 00:05:38.983\nBut if it gets to 50% or even 99%,\nand then we lose power, it just\n\n119\n00:05:38.983 --> 00:05:43.578\nthrows away the change and I still have\nthe original file that's not corrupted.\n\n120\n00:05:43.578 --> 00:05:46.260\nSo with removable media,\nthat is super useful.\n\n121\n00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.196\nBut even internal drives if I'm worried\nabout power loss and data corruption,\n\n122\n00:05:50.196 --> 00:05:51.557\njournaling really helps.\n\n123\n00:05:51.557 --> 00:05:54.878\nSo if you look,\nall four of these have Journaling.\n\n124\n00:05:54.878 --> 00:05:57.397\nI can’t choose not to do Journaling.\n\n125\n00:05:57.397 --> 00:06:00.201\nSo the basic one is\nOS X Extended (Journaled), and\n\n126\n00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:01.934\nthat’s a really nice feature.\n\n127\n00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:05.054\nThe other vendors out there,\nMicrosoft and Linux Distros,\n\n128\n00:06:05.054 --> 00:06:08.310\nthey are really scrambling to\ngive a good Journaling support.\n\n129\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.149\nSo Microsoft’s NTFS and\non Linux you have EXT4,\n\n130\n00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:14.204\nthey actually have introduced\nJournaling on those.\n\n131\n00:06:14.204 --> 00:06:16.623\nApple was one of the leaders on this\nthough, They really go in there and\n\n132\n00:06:16.623 --> 00:06:17.525\ngot it deployed quickly.\n\n133\n00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:19.068\nAnd it's a great solution.\n\n134\n00:06:19.068 --> 00:06:20.542\nYou definitely want Journaling.\n\n135\n00:06:20.542 --> 00:06:23.137\n>> Don,\nwe've got a question in the chatroom, and\n\n136\n00:06:23.137 --> 00:06:27.568\nI know that we've got episodes coming up\non data security, but somebody just asked\n\n137\n00:06:27.568 --> 00:06:31.527\nwhat kind of encryptions do you use,\nor do the use, I should say, Apple?\n\n138\n00:06:31.527 --> 00:06:33.942\nIf you do the File Vault encryption,\nit's AES-128.\n\n139\n00:06:33.942 --> 00:06:35.509\nIt's a pretty strong level.\n\n140\n00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.846\nNow, they talk about bumping\nit up to AES-256, and\n\n141\n00:06:38.846 --> 00:06:41.622\nI don't know if they've done that yet\nor not.\n\n142\n00:06:41.622 --> 00:06:43.637\nIt was supposed to be\ncoming in El Capitan but\n\n143\n00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:47.090\nI don't think it made the cut on that one,\nso expect that to change.\n\n144\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.941\nBut even on the older ones, it's AES-128,\nso it's pretty strong encryption.\n\n145\n00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:54.149\nAll right, so I wanna show you\nguys case sensitivity though,\n\n146\n00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:56.485\ncuz that's important and\na lot of people don't recognize this,\n\n147\n00:06:56.485 --> 00:06:58.113\nespecially if you come\nfrom a Windows world.\n\n148\n00:06:58.113 --> 00:06:59.659\nIf you come from a Unix world,\nyou're used to it.\n\n149\n00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:03.145\nI'm gonna create two\npartitions on this disk, so\n\n150\n00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:05.807\nI'm just gonna kinda divide this up.\n\n151\n00:07:05.807 --> 00:07:07.166\nSo it's 128 gig disk.\n\n152\n00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:09.441\nI’m gonna create two 60 gig partitions.\n\n153\n00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:13.471\nAnd the first one I'm just going to call,\n\n154\n00:07:13.471 --> 00:07:18.434\nyou know,\nmaybe OSX Extended Journaled, right?\n\n155\n00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:20.766\nSo that I can remember what it is.\n\n156\n00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:24.648\nAnd the other one,\nI'm going to make it case sensitive.\n\n157\n00:07:24.648 --> 00:07:33.119\nAnd so I'll say OSX Extended\n(Case-sensitive Journaled).\n\n158\n00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:33.754\nReally long names for\n\n159\n00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:35.877\nthese hard drives which you probably\nwouldn't want to do in real life.\n\n160\n00:07:35.877 --> 00:07:37.420\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and apply those.\n\n161\n00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.223\nAnd so what it's gonna do,\nis it's gonna create those two partitions.\n\n162\n00:07:41.223 --> 00:07:44.203\nAnd so I see my disk, that ASMT 2115.\n\n163\n00:07:44.203 --> 00:07:48.460\nThat's that external controller I've\ngot and the disk that's attached.\n\n164\n00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.760\nAnd now inside of it I see\nI've got two partitions and\n\n165\n00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.641\nthey both show up right here.\n\n166\n00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:58.318\nI can see that I've got these 60GB\npartitions in this GPT drive, right?\n\n167\n00:07:58.318 --> 00:08:01.861\nNow for an end user,\nThey just show up as two drives.\n\n168\n00:08:01.861 --> 00:08:04.241\nThey really don't see a difference\nbetween these drives.\n\n169\n00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:08.930\nFor an end user, if they pull up\nthe get Information screens on these,\n\n170\n00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.360\nthe one on the left is\nCase-sensitive Journaled.\n\n171\n00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.130\nThe one on the right is just Journaled.\n\n172\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.530\nAnd when I look at the information,\n\n173\n00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.390\nthere's not much of a difference here,\nright?\n\n174\n00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.540\nThe format name shows as different, but\n\n175\n00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.270\notherwise the amount of space that\nI have is basically the same.\n\n176\n00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.780\nThe more info screens\nare not really any different.\n\n177\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.635\nIt's just basically they look the same.\n\n178\n00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.290\nEnd users use them the same way.\n\n179\n00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.160\nBut the behavior is different and\nthat's why I named the drives that I could\n\n180\n00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.550\ntell them apart cuz otherwise I wouldn’t\nactually be able to tell them apart.\n\n181\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:43.380\nAnd so if I browse in the one, like let\nme just browse into OS X extended here,\n\n182\n00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.072\nthis one.\n\n183\n00:08:44.072 --> 00:08:48.510\nAnd when I browse into it,\nI'm gonna create a file here.\n\n184\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.660\nActually let me do it from the terminal,\nit'll be easier from the terminal.\n\n185\n00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.610\nAnd so what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna browse to that disk, and\n\n186\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.040\nin my Volumes folder I'll see that I\nnow have those two disks right there.\n\n187\n00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.220\nSo I see both of them,\nthe one that's just Journaled and\n\n188\n00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.900\nthe one that is Case-sensitive.\n\n189\n00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.840\nAnd I'm gonna get into the Journaled one,\nall right?\n\n190\n00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.150\nSo here I am in my Journaled disk.\n\n191\n00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.600\nAnd it's got some data cuz it,\n\n192\n00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.530\nwhat it did is it didn't\nactually format the whole disk.\n\n193\n00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.930\nIt just shrunk the one partition so\nit's still has my OS X installer on it,\n\n194\n00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:18.630\ncuz that was the format.\n\n195\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.580\nIf I changed the format,\nit would have erased it.\n\n196\n00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.080\nI can always go and\nerase this if I really wanted to.\n\n197\n00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.220\nBut what I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna create a file.\n\n198\n00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.920\nI'm gonna use the touch command to do it,\nright?\n\n199\n00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.930\nWhen you run the touch command if\na file doesn't exist it creates it.\n\n200\n00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.770\nAnd so I'm going to create a file\ncalled filename.txt, all right?\n\n201\n00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.000\nSo I just ran touch filename.txt.\n\n202\n00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.240\nAnd shoot,\nI'm in the room to removal drive.\n\n203\n00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.230\nThis probably isn't on the exam.\n\n204\n00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.170\nActually I think it might even be\non the exam for removal media.\n\n205\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.010\nWhen you create removal media\nthere's ownership assigned to it.\n\n206\n00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.390\nAnd to write to the root of a drive,\nyou have to be an admin.\n\n207\n00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.048\nAnd so\nyou see how I got permission denied,\n\n208\n00:09:54.048 --> 00:09:55.530\nI'm not allowed to write to the root?\n\n209\n00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.670\nAnd that's because\nthe ownership on this disk.\n\n210\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.400\nWell, if I provide admin credentials,\nit'll let me write.\n\n211\n00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.810\nSo if I do a sudo and then run it,\nit will let me do it.\n\n212\n00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.050\nI'll just have to provide\nmy administrative password.\n\n213\n00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.325\nBut on removal media,\nwe don't necessarily want that.\n\n214\n00:10:08.325 --> 00:10:11.730\nCuz what if I disconnect this drive and\nI plug it into Wes's laptop?\n\n215\n00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.150\nWell, he doesn't have my admin account.\n\n216\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.660\nThe admin account is\nover here on my laptop.\n\n217\n00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.690\nHe doesn't have ownership and\nnow the drive's messed up.\n\n218\n00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.430\nThe permissions aren't gonna work right.\n\n219\n00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.460\nSo, on removable media a lot of times\nwe'll wanna turn that ownership off.\n\n220\n00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.080\nAnd so, if I pull up the get info screens\non these drives and we take a look way\n\n221\n00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.810\ndown at the bottom of their settings as we\nkind of drill down to the bottoms here.\n\n222\n00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.250\nYou'll see there's this little\noption way down here that says,\n\n223\n00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.010\nignore ownership on this volume.\n\n224\n00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.990\nAnd it's grayed out because I\nneed to unlock the disk first.\n\n225\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.260\nSo let me just unlock it here.\n\n226\n00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.485\nDo I not know my password?\n\n227\n00:10:47.485 --> 00:10:49.300\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n228\n00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.120\nIt's one of my assorted passwords.\n\n229\n00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.180\nI'm gonna unlock both of these.\n\n230\n00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.710\nAnd I can turn that off and\non removable media, you want that on.\n\n231\n00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:57.920\nOn internal media, you don't.\n\n232\n00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.210\nIt's always gonna be on your system.\n\n233\n00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.670\nYour admin account will always be there.\n\n234\n00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.920\nBut on removable media,\nyou likely want to turn that off.\n\n235\n00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.970\nAnd so I'm gonna check that and\nwatch the permissions up here.\n\n236\n00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.828\nSee how the permissions on this one,\nit shows system is Read Write,\n\n237\n00:11:08.828 --> 00:11:10.952\nadmin is Read Write,\neveryone else is Read only.\n\n238\n00:11:10.952 --> 00:11:14.200\nWhen I check that, it changes.\n\n239\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.110\nI say it changes, but you can look over\nhere and see how this one changed.\n\n240\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.810\nAnd it's showing me as read & write, staff\nas read & write, everyone else, read only.\n\n241\n00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.350\nSo it kinda changes who that owner is, and\nthis one didn't change for some reason.\n\n242\n00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.690\nAll right, so I'll probably still have to\nprovide administrative privileges on that\n\n243\n00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.169\none, but we'll close those.\n\n244\n00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.210\nAnd let's try this again.\n\n245\n00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.610\nSo now, when I run that touch file name.\n\n246\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.270\nSee how it didn't prompt me for\nadmin privileges this time?\n\n247\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.830\nIt let me do it and\nnow I can create that file.\n\n248\n00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:48.220\nAnd if I look, I've now got a file\ncalled filename.txt right there, okay?\n\n249\n00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.930\nIt's empty, but it exists.\n\n250\n00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.090\nNow let's run a few more commands.\n\n251\n00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.970\nI'm gonna say, that was touch filename,\nand I did it in all lowercase.\n\n252\n00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.840\nLet's start to mix that case up.\n\n253\n00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.330\nI'm gonna capitalize F, and\nI'm gonna capitalize N, so\n\n254\n00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.490\nit's FileName with a capital F and\na capital N.\n\n255\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:09.840\nAnd I'm gonna do the same thing, but\nall capitalized, FILENAME.txt, like that.\n\n256\n00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.250\nSo I just ran the touch command three\ntimes with different file names, and\n\n257\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:18.880\nif I look at my file system I just have\nthe one file, I don't have the other,\n\n258\n00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.830\nand that's because the default\nfile system is not case sensitive.\n\n259\n00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.660\nIt's one is the same.\n\n260\n00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.150\nWell, we can make it case sensitive.\n\n261\n00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.590\nWhy would we want that?\n\n262\n00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.180\nWell, under the hood,\nMac OS is running BSD.\n\n263\n00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:36.230\nIt's a Unix variant, and in the Unix\nworld, if you're truly POSIX complaint,\n\n264\n00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.190\nthat's the standard that\nkind of defines Unix.\n\n265\n00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.960\nIf you're truly POSIX complaint,\nyou have case sensitivity.\n\n266\n00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.880\nBut it's on here to make\nit easier on end users.\n\n267\n00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.420\nWe don't want end users to have to worry\nabout the case of things from the changing\n\n268\n00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.000\ndirectories or\nbrowsing the hard drive or whatever.\n\n269\n00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.810\nWe don't wanna have to worry about that.\n\n270\n00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.220\nBut if you're trying to maintain\ncompatibility with some kind of Unix\n\n271\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.800\napplication, you need it.\n\n272\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:59.470\nAnd so that's where our case\nsensitive drives come in and\n\n273\n00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.390\nwhat the heck did I call that disk?\n\n274\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.150\nThere we go, all right.\n\n275\n00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.268\nSo I'm gonna change into\nthe case sensitive one now,\n\n276\n00:13:05.268 --> 00:13:08.060\nand I'm gonna run those\nsame three commands again.\n\n277\n00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.780\nAnd let me stretch this out because\nI'm gonna run out of room here.\n\n278\n00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:16.161\nAnd so I'm gonna do touch,\nand I'll do filename.txt,\n\n279\n00:13:16.161 --> 00:13:23.571\nlike that and I'll do touch FileName.txt\nand I'll do touch FILENAME.txt.\n\n280\n00:13:23.571 --> 00:13:26.258\nAnd for those of you listening\non the audio stream,\n\n281\n00:13:26.258 --> 00:13:28.270\neach one of those is a different case.\n\n282\n00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.020\nOne is all lowercase,\none is all uppercase, one is mixed case,\n\n283\n00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.790\ncapital letters and lowercase letters.\n\n284\n00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:37.170\nAnd if I look on here at my files,\nsee how I've got all three?\n\n285\n00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.970\nTo Unix, it's three separate files,\nthey have different case sensitivity.\n\n286\n00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.250\nNow, most of us are never\ngonna use this option, okay.\n\n287\n00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.900\nCuz that's probably what some of you guys\nare thinking, why would I ever do that?\n\n288\n00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.260\nIt really is that we're trying to maintain\ncompatibility with Unix applications.\n\n289\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.220\nAnd you're seeing more and\nmore developers using OS X these days.\n\n290\n00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.750\nAnd if you're developing web applications\nfor Amazon Web Services or Docker or\n\n291\n00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.390\nwhatever, then you need that\ncase sensitivity, and so\n\n292\n00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.440\nwe can format our drive and maintain that.\n\n293\n00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.800\nAnd so it's just up to us to choose\nthat when we're formatting the disk,\n\n294\n00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.700\nit's just another choice that we can make.\n\n295\n00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.310\nAnd so when you see those four different\noptions in there, each one is really just\n\n296\n00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.090\ntalking about whether we want\nthat case sensitivity or not.\n\n297\n00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:23.445\nNow the other two that are here on the\nlist I didn't talk about MS-DOS and ExFAT,\n\n298\n00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:23.995\nright?\n\n299\n00:14:23.995 --> 00:14:27.210\nMS-DOS, that's the old\nfile allocation table and\n\n300\n00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.740\nthere's actually three\ndifferent versions of FAT.\n\n301\n00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.950\nThere's the original 8-bit one,\nthere's 16-bit, and\n\n302\n00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.740\nthere's 32-bit, this is the 32-bit\nversion of FAT, so it's actually FAT 32.\n\n303\n00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:40.740\nWe can format as FAT and if you do that,\nyour disk will be readable on Linux,\n\n304\n00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.860\nWindows, and Mac,\nyou'll have full compatibility.\n\n305\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.020\nBut here's the problem,\nFAT is super sensitive.\n\n306\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.080\nIt's really easy to get corrupted data,\nit doesn't do any journaling.\n\n307\n00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.150\nSo if you format removable media FAT,\nyou have to make sure than\n\n308\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.860\nwhen you remove it that you\nalways properly eject the media.\n\n309\n00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:03.310\nAnd by inject it, what I mean is, when we\nare ready to go and we don't need this\n\n310\n00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:08.010\ndisk anymore, you can drag it and drop\nit into your recycle bin or your trash.\n\n311\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.725\nAnd notice how my trash, normally it just\nshows up as Has that little trash bucket.\n\n312\n00:15:11.725 --> 00:15:16.220\nBut the instant I grab a drive,\nthe icon changes to an eject button.\n\n313\n00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.195\nAnd so we can hit that and eject it.\n\n314\n00:15:18.195 --> 00:15:20.435\nAnd if you've got more than one\npartition on your removable disk,\n\n315\n00:15:20.435 --> 00:15:23.495\nit's gonna ask if you wanna eject\nthem all or just that one disk.\n\n316\n00:15:23.495 --> 00:15:24.905\nI'm just gonna eject that one.\n\n317\n00:15:24.905 --> 00:15:28.765\nAnd so we can eject it, you need make sure\nyou do that before you unplug the disk.\n\n318\n00:15:28.765 --> 00:15:31.175\nIf you don't, FAT is super sensitive.\n\n319\n00:15:31.175 --> 00:15:35.060\nSo while you get great compatibility out\nof it the sensitivity is too dangerous.\n\n320\n00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.710\nI don't like to use it.\n\n321\n00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:37.760\n>> How about encryption?\n\n322\n00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.340\nDo we get any benefit of an encryption\nif we're gonna use one on\n\n323\n00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.550\nthe FAT File System?\n\n324\n00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.900\n>> No, FAT is really basic.\n\n325\n00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.775\nNo encryption, no case sensitivity,\nno Journaling.\n\n326\n00:15:47.775 --> 00:15:48.808\nNo file permissions, right.\n\n327\n00:15:48.808 --> 00:15:51.485\nDo I say that one twice?\nNo file permissions though, so\n\n328\n00:15:51.485 --> 00:15:53.005\nanybody can get at the data.\n\n329\n00:15:53.005 --> 00:15:53.877\nIt's very basic.\n\n330\n00:15:53.877 --> 00:15:56.129\nBut that's also why it's so\ncompatible, right.\n\n331\n00:15:56.129 --> 00:16:00.515\nOne big problem with that 32 is that it's\ngot a maximum file size of 4 GB Anybody\n\n332\n00:16:00.515 --> 00:16:02.074\nworking files over 4 gigs?\n\n333\n00:16:02.074 --> 00:16:05.643\nI think most of us do these days,\nand so it's not able to handle that.\n\n334\n00:16:05.643 --> 00:16:08.730\nSo Microsoft tried to work out something\na little better to get around that.\n\n335\n00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.550\nAnd they created a newer\nversion of FAT called exFAT, so\n\n336\n00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.790\nwhen I pulled up this disc and\nI went to partition it,\n\n337\n00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.620\nyou probably saw that option there at\nthe bottom, probably cuz I pointed it out.\n\n338\n00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.960\nBut you got exFAT, which is\nthe extended file allocation table, and\n\n339\n00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.100\nthat can handle much larger file sizes.\n\n340\n00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.122\nBut all the weaknesses\nof FAT are still there.\n\n341\n00:16:27.122 --> 00:16:30.106\nIt's still super sensitive, so\nI don't like to use those, all right?\n\n342\n00:16:30.106 --> 00:16:37.170\nThese are all the file systems that\nyour OS X install can read and write.\n\n343\n00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:41.971\nBut there's other ones that we can\nonly read, that we don't see here.\n\n344\n00:16:41.971 --> 00:16:44.491\nSo, for example, on a Windows machine,\n\n345\n00:16:44.491 --> 00:16:48.313\non a Windows machine the most\ncommon file system in use is NTFS.\n\n346\n00:16:48.313 --> 00:16:50.710\nThat's their New Technology File System.\n\n347\n00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:55.360\nIt was introduced in, gosh,\nit's actually been around a long time.\n\n348\n00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.766\nI think it was introduced in NT4, it might\nof been in NT351, if I remember right, so\n\n349\n00:16:59.766 --> 00:17:00.610\na long time ago.\n\n350\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:05.063\nBut it's been there in WIndows 2000,\nWIndows XP, WIndows VIsta,\n\n351\n00:17:05.063 --> 00:17:08.795\nthe amazing gem that it is,\nWindows 7, 8, 10, right?\n\n352\n00:17:08.795 --> 00:17:12.310\nSo it's been around a long time,\nand it's used by Microsoft.\n\n353\n00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.310\nAnd it's proprietary to Microsoft.\n\n354\n00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:19.650\nSo for Apple, they put drivers in so\nthat we could read the data.\n\n355\n00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.680\nBut if you wanna write to it you have to\nlicense the technology from Microsoft and\n\n356\n00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.330\nApple said no, it's not worth it,\ncuz they didn't license that piece.\n\n357\n00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:30.650\nSo if we plug in an NTFS disk we can read\nit but we can't write to it, all right?\n\n358\n00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:31.590\nAnd let me just show you here.\n\n359\n00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.550\nI'll take another system that I've got and\n\n360\n00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.680\non this system I'm gonna\nplug in a USB key.\n\n361\n00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.830\nSo this USB key is formatted NTFS and\n\n362\n00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:46.030\nif I plug it in, like so, all right?\n\n363\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.560\nIt's gonna show up here on the computer,\neventually.\n\n364\n00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.877\nAnd it looks like my disk\nutility is warning me, shoot,\n\n365\n00:17:53.877 --> 00:17:57.730\nmy other computer picked up\ninstead of the virtual machine.\n\n366\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.860\nAll right, well I'll show you\nhere on this machine then.\n\n367\n00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.770\nSo it picked it up here and\nI can see Patriot Memory Untitled, right,\n\n368\n00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.190\nthat's my USB key that I just plugged in.\n\n369\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.720\nAnd if I browse into it over here, I can\nsee it's got some files on it, right?\n\n370\n00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.738\nSo here's the files.\n\n371\n00:18:11.738 --> 00:18:16.610\nThis is it from a Windows system,\nright, and if I look at it here in my\n\n372\n00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:21.660\ndisk utility, I see that Patriot Memory\nand look at that Partition Map.\n\n373\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.510\nIt's not GPT, is it?\n\n374\n00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.000\nIt's Master Boot Record, it's MBR.\n\n375\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.603\nThis came from a Windows system and\n\n376\n00:18:26.603 --> 00:18:29.042\nit formatted this USB key\nwith a Master Boot Record.\n\n377\n00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:34.042\nAnd if I look at the partition and I come\nover here, well, I can see it's Capacity,\n\n378\n00:18:34.042 --> 00:18:39.130\nit's Mount Point, the Device, and right\nup here, I can see it's formatted NTFS.\n\n379\n00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.833\nIt's an external physical volume\nformatted for a WIndows system.\n\n380\n00:18:42.833 --> 00:18:43.671\nI can read it.\n\n381\n00:18:43.671 --> 00:18:44.565\nI can give it that data.\n\n382\n00:18:44.565 --> 00:18:46.866\nSo if somebody's using a Windows\nmachine and they wanna give me data,\n\n383\n00:18:46.866 --> 00:18:47.454\nthey can do that.\n\n384\n00:18:47.454 --> 00:18:52.506\nBut if I go into that disc and I try and,\nlet me try and rename a file, right?\n\n385\n00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:53.970\nSo I wanna rename this file.\n\n386\n00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.050\nWhere's my rename option, right?\n\n387\n00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.700\nIt's gone.\nI can't write to this disk.\n\n388\n00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.940\nWhere's my new folder option?\n\n389\n00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.050\nIt's gone.\n\n390\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.612\nWhere's my delete option?\n\n391\n00:19:04.612 --> 00:19:08.470\nWhoops, [LAUGH] if I can\nstop clicking like crazy,\n\n392\n00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.450\nif I wanna delete this folder,\ndelete's gone.\n\n393\n00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.950\nI can't write to this disk.\n\n394\n00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.910\nNTFS is a read-only format for us.\n\n395\n00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:15.980\nWe can read it.\n\n396\n00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.170\nBut we can't write to it.\n\n397\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.860\nThere's other formats that are out\nthere that are kind of like this,\n\n398\n00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.270\nNTSF is the biggest example,\nbut Linux EXT formats,\n\n399\n00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.790\nlike EXT 3 and EXT 4,\nwe can read those too, but\n\n400\n00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.850\nyou're not, you can make it write to them,\nby default it won't write to them.\n\n401\n00:19:34.125 --> 00:19:36.659\nUFS, the Unix File System,\nback in the day,\n\n402\n00:19:36.659 --> 00:19:39.749\nApple used UFS on some of\nthe early OS X distributions.\n\n403\n00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.280\nBut, I believe it was 10.5 was the last\nversion where you could format a disk,\n\n404\n00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.080\nUFS.\n\n405\n00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.190\nSo on your modern ones,\n\n406\n00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:52.070\nlike my El Capitan install, we didn't see\nUFS as an option when I formatted a disk.\n\n407\n00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:56.170\nBut if I plug in a UFS system, a drive,\nI'll be able to read and write to it.\n\n408\n00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.900\nThat it still supports it,\nit just won't let you format it, and\n\n409\n00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.360\nthat's because UFS is outdated.\n\n410\n00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.980\nWe don't wanna use UFS anymore, OS X\nExtended Journaled, that one's the one.\n\n411\n00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.650\nThat's the better one, and so\n\n412\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.860\nApple stopped making that\nan option where you can format it.\n\n413\n00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.410\nThere's ways.\n\n414\n00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.080\nYou can drop down to the terminal, there's\nadvanced commands you can use to format\n\n415\n00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.919\nit, but in this utility and\non the exam, it's not possible.\n\n416\n00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:18.680\nAll right, Wes,\nI feel like I left a file system out.\n\n417\n00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.310\nDid I leave one out?\n\n418\n00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.690\n>> No, I think you've got them all Don.\n\n419\n00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.084\nI think we've got every one.\n\n420\n00:20:22.084 --> 00:20:23.024\n>> We've done them all.\n\n421\n00:20:23.024 --> 00:20:23.670\nThat's amazing.\n\n422\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:28.740\nAll right, well let's talk a little\nbit more about just disks in general.\n\n423\n00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.990\nI mentioned how FAT and FAT32, how\nsensitive they are, and how easy it is to\n\n424\n00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:38.210\ncorrupt the data if we start unplugging\ndevices and not doing it properly.\n\n425\n00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:42.390\nSo, for example,\nI'll take my disk utility here, and\n\n426\n00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:46.890\nlet's just get rid of this USB key, or\nactually, we can keep using the USB key.\n\n427\n00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.170\nIt's NTFS, I can't read and write to it.\n\n428\n00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:48.840\nSo let me format it.\n\n429\n00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.630\nI'm gonna erase that disk,\nand I'm gonna give it a name.\n\n430\n00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.712\nI'll just call it my USB Key.\n\n431\n00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:56.603\nAnd I'm gonna format it, FAT, right?\n\n432\n00:20:56.603 --> 00:21:00.021\nSo I'm gonna format it so\nthat Microsoft format, and we can do GPT.\n\n433\n00:21:00.021 --> 00:21:01.924\nWe can do master boot record.\n\n434\n00:21:01.924 --> 00:21:03.202\nI can do Apple partition map, right?\n\n435\n00:21:03.202 --> 00:21:06.177\nHere's my choice where I'm\npicking that partition scheme,\n\n436\n00:21:06.177 --> 00:21:07.614\nI'm gonna stick it with MBR.\n\n437\n00:21:07.614 --> 00:21:09.661\nI want this to be as\ncompatible as possible, so\n\n438\n00:21:09.661 --> 00:21:12.550\nI can take it to UNIX machines or\nwhatever, and it'll work.\n\n439\n00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.810\nSo I'm gonna erase that.\n\n440\n00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:14.960\nAnd it's formatting that disk.\n\n441\n00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.590\nAnd as soon as it's done, I'll be\nable to read and write to that disk.\n\n442\n00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.830\nBut it's FAT32, so I've got limitations.\n\n443\n00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:25.230\nIf I have some really big file,\nsomething over 4 gigs,\n\n444\n00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:29.420\nI'm not gonna be able to write it to\nthe disk because the file is too big.\n\n445\n00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.580\nIf I have files with\nreally long file names,\n\n446\n00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.040\nFAT32 can have a problem with that, too.\n\n447\n00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.250\nBut then there's just\nthe general sensitivity of it.\n\n448\n00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.340\nLet me copy something over to it.\n\n449\n00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.290\nLet's copy iBooks.\n\n450\n00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.580\nI'm gonna copy iBooks\nover to that USB key.\n\n451\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.340\nAnd so it's gonna copy over,\neventually, there it goes.\n\n452\n00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:50.030\nSo I'm copying a blazing\n51 MB of data over to it.\n\n453\n00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.090\nAnd that data's gonna copy over and\nit's being written, and the 1s and\n\n454\n00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.360\n0s are being written, and then the file\nallocation table is being updated to show\n\n455\n00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.550\nwhere that data is so\nwe can find it again in the future.\n\n456\n00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:00.810\nAnd it's gonna write it down.\n\n457\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:04.550\nIt's not terribly fast because\nit's the older technology.\n\n458\n00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:08.670\nEven though I'm on a USB3 drive,\nthis is painfully slow.\n\n459\n00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.040\nBut once it writes it,\nI can take it, and eject it.\n\n460\n00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.010\nNow, if I eject it properly,\nmy data will stay safe.\n\n461\n00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.100\nBut if I'm in a hurry?\n\n462\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.160\nI need to get this data out of here,\nright?\n\n463\n00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.670\nSo, when it's done, I just reach right\nover and rip that drive right out, okay?\n\n464\n00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.320\nWell, the drive disappeared, it went away,\n\n465\n00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.940\nand it's not really griping\nat me all that much.\n\n466\n00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.810\nBut the odds of me corrupting\nthis disk are fairly high.\n\n467\n00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:36.073\nAnd so when I plug it back in, it may tell\nme that the disk was improperly ejected,\n\n468\n00:22:36.073 --> 00:22:39.607\nthat the files system isn't clean,\nand that it's got problems.\n\n469\n00:22:39.607 --> 00:22:40.714\nOr if I timed it just right,\n\n470\n00:22:40.714 --> 00:22:43.619\nit might be perfectly healthy which\nis what apparently happened here.\n\n471\n00:22:43.619 --> 00:22:47.498\n[LAUGH] So, and usually you'll get\na warning about that and on mine,\n\n472\n00:22:47.498 --> 00:22:50.580\nI guess I got it too late,\nso it's not unhappy.\n\n473\n00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.460\nBut, at that point,\n\n474\n00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.360\nyou might have corrupted data, and\nyou might not be able to access this disk.\n\n475\n00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.610\nWhat do we do then?\n\n476\n00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.120\n>> Is Mac, I got a question for\nyou on this one, Don.\n\n477\n00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.980\nIs Mac fairly strict about reading to\na drive itself that might be corrupted,\n\n478\n00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.350\nmaybe if you plug it in,\nwill it might not even be seen at all?\n\n479\n00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.850\n>> It might not.\n\n480\n00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:12.660\nRemember the three things that you\nhave to recognize, the physical disk,\n\n481\n00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.060\nthe partition map, and\nthen the file system.\n\n482\n00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.620\nIn this scenario, if it doesn't recognize\none of those, it's not gonna show up.\n\n483\n00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.730\nIf one of those have been damaged,\nlike if the partition map is damaged,\n\n484\n00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:28.470\nthen I might see the physical hardware but\nnot the partitions to map it, right?\n\n485\n00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:33.360\nAnd once a file system is applied,\nwhat you've got is a file system\n\n486\n00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.960\nthat's available, and\nwe see it is what's called a volume.\n\n487\n00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.270\nSo you've really got the physical disk,\nthe partition, and the volume, right,\n\n488\n00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.190\nwhich I keep calling the file system.\n\n489\n00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.303\nAnd we see it in the terminal cuz\nit shows up in the Volumes folder.\n\n490\n00:23:44.303 --> 00:23:46.914\nAnd so what you might have is\nwhere the disk is visible, but\n\n491\n00:23:46.914 --> 00:23:50.400\nwhen you go into the Volumes folder,\nit might not show up right here, right?\n\n492\n00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.746\nMy USB key is, but maybe it doesn't.\n\n493\n00:23:52.746 --> 00:23:55.577\nAnd if it doesn't show up,\nthat's a really easy way to spot, and\n\n494\n00:23:55.577 --> 00:23:57.855\nsay, it's probably gotten damaged somehow.\n\n495\n00:23:57.855 --> 00:24:00.514\nWell, sometimes you can\nfix it really easily.\n\n496\n00:24:00.514 --> 00:24:03.299\nSometimes you can't fix it,\nsometimes you just need to format and\n\n497\n00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:06.779\nyou just lost the data on there, but other\ntimes you can come into the Disk Utility,\n\n498\n00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:09.470\nand you can run what's called First Aid.\n\n499\n00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.270\nWhat First Aid does, it runs a few things.\n\n500\n00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.910\nNow, if you're a long-term Mac user,\n\n501\n00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.530\nit used to be that this was several\ndifferent tools that were separated.\n\n502\n00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.420\nApple's just rolled them all together\nnow into one super button, and\n\n503\n00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:24.780\nso this one button performs the activities\nthat several different tools did before.\n\n504\n00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.890\nFor example, it will check the disk for\nerrors, right?\n\n505\n00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.090\nSo, it'll analyze the disk, look for\nany corruption, and if it finds it,\n\n506\n00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.600\nit'll try and fix it, right?\n\n507\n00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.940\nIt does what's called verifying the disk,\nthat's looking for errors, and\n\n508\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.650\nrepairing the disk,\nthat's fixing those errors.\n\n509\n00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:43.640\nIt also verifies permissions and\nfixes permissions, so\n\n510\n00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.220\nthe file permissions have\ngotten mixed up or messed up.\n\n511\n00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.820\nIt'll try and fix those and\nput them back to the right way.\n\n512\n00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.590\nIt's gonna do all of that,\nincluding rebuilding the partition table,\n\n513\n00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.450\nif necessary, to try and\nkeep our data healthy.\n\n514\n00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.630\nIf you ever run into that situation\nwhere you plug in the disk and\n\n515\n00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.520\nthe partition table is not being\nrecognized or it's not showing up\n\n516\n00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:04.980\nin your volumes folder, you might need\nto come in here and try and fix it.\n\n517\n00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.690\nNow the only thing you can't\nfix from the Disk Utility\n\n518\n00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.530\nis that the physical\nhardware doesn't show up.\n\n519\n00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.700\nIf the physical hardware doesn't show up,\nyou likely have a hardware malfunction on\n\n520\n00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.720\nthe disk, not much software\ncan do about that, right?\n\n521\n00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.280\nBut, as long as you see the hardware,\n\n522\n00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.220\nyou'll be able to get to\nthe First Aid button.\n\n523\n00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:25.250\nSo, I see the SSD controller,\nI see that ASMT controller for my USB.\n\n524\n00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.370\nI see these things, and\nI can run First Aid on them, and\n\n525\n00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:32.500\nthat'll fix the partition table, or\nif it's a problem with just the volume,\n\n526\n00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:37.030\nI can pick the specific volume,\nand I can run First Aid to try and\n\n527\n00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:41.530\nfix just that volume, just that file\nsystem and get it fixed, all right?\n\n528\n00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:42.770\nSo, this is a good way to do it.\n\n529\n00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:47.770\nNow, if you're doing removal of media,\nthis works really well, but\n\n530\n00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.200\nif it's your operating system drive,\nit doesn't work so well, and\n\n531\n00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.310\nthe reason it doesn't is because your\noperating system drive is in use.\n\n532\n00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.950\nI'm using it right now,\nI'm booted to this operating system,\n\n533\n00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.640\nhow can it repair an operating\nsystem I'm booted into?\n\n534\n00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.635\nEven if I boot to recovery, the recovery\npartition is right here on my hard drive.\n\n535\n00:26:05.635 --> 00:26:07.540\nThat means the hard drive is still in use,\nand\n\n536\n00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.190\nI can't really mess with\nthe partition table cuz it's in use.\n\n537\n00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:14.390\nIf it's your operating system drive,\nthe First Aid button's not so convenient.\n\n538\n00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:19.460\nYou can try and boot from removable\nmedia if you have an OS 10 install disk,\n\n539\n00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.640\nlike the one I just formatted.\n\n540\n00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.230\nYou can boot off of that and\nrun Disk Utility from it,\n\n541\n00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.810\nyou can do Internet Recovery, where you\nboot up holding Command + Option + R,\n\n542\n00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:30.160\nboot to Internet Recovery and\nrun Disk Utility there.\n\n543\n00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.490\nOr, you can boot to Target Mode, where you\nboot up holding T on your keyboard, and\n\n544\n00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:37.410\nnow your computer boots up as if\nit was a giant, removable drive.\n\n545\n00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.920\nYou can plug it into another Mac and\nrun Disk Utility from there.\n\n546\n00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.470\nThere's three different\nways that we can get at it,\n\n547\n00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.950\nwhere our operating system\ndrive isn't in use, but\n\n548\n00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:49.200\nfor our removable media,\nwe can take them offline whenever we want.\n\n549\n00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.370\nInside of the Disk Utility,\nwhat you'll notice is,\n\n550\n00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.820\nsee how all of these drives have\na little eject button beside them?\n\n551\n00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:59.380\nWhat that's called in the Unix world\nis mounting and unmounting the disk.\n\n552\n00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.120\nWhen you plug a disk in,\nwe recognize it, but\n\n553\n00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.350\nit doesn't show up in our volumes\nfolder until it's mounted.\n\n554\n00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:10.160\nSo, if I take this OS X Extended Journaled\nand I hit Unmount,\n\n555\n00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.090\nit's going to effectively eject the disk,\nbut I still know it's there.\n\n556\n00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.830\nSee what shows up, and\nit's just grayed out, right?\n\n557\n00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:21.760\nThey're there, I'm just not using them,\nI can take them and mount them and\n\n558\n00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.480\nmake them available.\n\n559\n00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.960\nIf I go to my Volumes folder right now and\nI look,\n\n560\n00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:31.380\nsee how none of those OS X Extended\nwhatever partitions are showing up?\n\n561\n00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.470\nThey're not mounted, I see the hardware,\nI see the partition map, but\n\n562\n00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.910\nI haven't mounted any of\nthe partitions to become volumes.\n\n563\n00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.850\nSo, over here I can choose those and\n\n564\n00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:45.440\nI can mount them, and now they're\ngonna show up in my volumes again.\n\n565\n00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.770\nWhen I come over here and look,\nthere they are, they've all reappeared.\n\n566\n00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:52.380\nNow, why would I want to unmount a volume?\n\n567\n00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.946\nIf I want to guarantee that\nnobody is touching it,\n\n568\n00:27:54.946 --> 00:27:58.792\nif I want to make sure that I'm the only\nperson using it, I can unmount it and\n\n569\n00:27:58.792 --> 00:28:01.687\nmake sure that no software is\nwriting to it or whatever.\n\n570\n00:28:01.687 --> 00:28:06.450\nI've got exclusive access and\nnow I can run first data on it, right?\n\n571\n00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.212\nFirst data will actually do it for you,\nso you don't have to unmount first,\n\n572\n00:28:09.212 --> 00:28:11.280\nbut you can't do that with\nthe operating system.\n\n573\n00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.290\nIf I try to unmount the operating system,\nwhat would happen?\n\n574\n00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:15.160\nMy computer would freeze.\n\n575\n00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.900\nIt would be the end to my to\nmy little adventure there, so\n\n576\n00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.020\nthat's where we would have to go into\nTarget Mode or Boot to Recovery, or\n\n577\n00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.030\nsomething like that,\nto be able to run repair.\n\n578\n00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:28.390\nNow on my USB key that I inappropriately\nremoved, I can choose the USB Key and\n\n579\n00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.180\nhit First Aid, and\nit's gonna run First Aid on it.\n\n580\n00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.220\nSee how it says it'll check for\ndisk errors, and\n\n581\n00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.240\nit will then repair the disk if necessary.\n\n582\n00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.470\nIt's gonna scan the disk and\nsee if it can find any problems, and\n\n583\n00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.860\nI didn't have any problems,\nso it was okay with that.\n\n584\n00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.850\nAnd so, there it goes,\nright, so now it's fine.\n\n585\n00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:47.530\nIf I were to run that from the volume,\nit does the same basic thing.\n\n586\n00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.270\nIt's really running the same type of\nchecks, except it won't run scans on\n\n587\n00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:54.080\nother volumes that might be on it,\nif I got it partitioned out.\n\n588\n00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.430\nAll right, I was really hoping to\ngenerate a disk error on that one.\n\n589\n00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.090\nI guess, maybe if I copy\nsomething a little bit bigger and\n\n590\n00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:05.070\nactually remove it while it's copying,\nthat could be fun, right?\n\n591\n00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:09.260\nSo here it goes,\nit's gonna start copying eventually.\n\n592\n00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.981\nDid I not, Maybe I didn't\nclick with enough conviction.\n\n593\n00:29:16.236 --> 00:29:18.640\nThere we go, all right, so there we go.\n\n594\n00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.790\nI just unplugged while it was copying,\nand so immediately I got\n\n595\n00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:25.630\nthis Finder Can't Complete Operation,\nsome data can't be read or written.\n\n596\n00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:30.260\nThat disk just improperly went away, and\nso it's not terribly happy about that, and\n\n597\n00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:34.480\nwhen I plug it back in, technically\nI've got damaged data in there.\n\n598\n00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.930\nThe operating system oftentimes\nwill repair that for me, and\n\n599\n00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:41.385\nI don't have to worry about it, so when I\ngo into the USB Key, it'll try and fix it.\n\n600\n00:29:41.385 --> 00:29:45.410\nSo, see how Haroopad is showing up there,\nand see it's a light gray?\n\n601\n00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.930\nWhy is it a light gray?\n\n602\n00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.560\nWell, it's a damaged file, it's not\ncompletely written, I can't run it.\n\n603\n00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.800\nIt's not a true application,\nand so it shows as grayed out.\n\n604\n00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.150\nIt's corrupted, right?\n\n605\n00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.380\nNow I've got some disk corruption.\n\n606\n00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.480\nNow it's not real disk corruption cuz\nI could just delete this file and\n\n607\n00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.360\nI'm back in business.\n\n608\n00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.560\nI know what happened, but\nif I didn't know what happened,\n\n609\n00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.780\nthat's where I could run First Aid and\nit would tell you,\n\n610\n00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.350\nbut honestly I would just delete\nthat file and that would be that.\n\n611\n00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.230\n>> Now I've had some USB drives that I've\n\n612\n00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:14.690\nmoved between things like my MacBook and\nas well out to Windows.\n\n613\n00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.410\nOne of the things I've known,\ntaken all that advice,\n\n614\n00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.690\ntrying to eject it properly, trying to\ndo what you're supposed to be doing and\n\n615\n00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:24.755\nnot corrupt the data, but\nthe drive doesn't want to eject.\n\n616\n00:30:24.755 --> 00:30:25.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What's going on there, man?\n\n617\n00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:26.880\nHelp me out with that one.\n\n618\n00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.380\n>> All right, so\n\n619\n00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:31.890\nsometimes a software program can\nlock a drive that's in use, right?\n\n620\n00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.600\nAnd so, it won't let you unmount it,\nit won't let you eject that disk.\n\n621\n00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.010\nAnd, for example,\nlet me see if I can lock this one.\n\n622\n00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.500\nI'm in my Volumes, and\nif I get into my USB folder, and\n\n623\n00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:46.160\nI'm gonna run a little Unix program here,\nI'll do vi to open up a file.\n\n624\n00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.232\nI start typing a file, right?\n\n625\n00:30:48.232 --> 00:30:51.608\nSo, this is a file,\nI'm in the process of typing a file, and\n\n626\n00:30:51.608 --> 00:30:53.710\nthe file is stored on that USB key.\n\n627\n00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:58.320\nThis program is running, and\nit's using that key, right?\n\n628\n00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.420\nOr I copied iBooks to it, or\nlet me copy good old Haroopad.\n\n629\n00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:06.050\nWhere did Haroopad go?\n\n630\n00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.060\nDid I lose it?\nThere it is, so I'm going to copy it and\n\n631\n00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:12.230\nactually let it copy this time,\ninstead of being all corrupt for me.\n\n632\n00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.670\nIt's gonna copy over, and\nas soon as it's done, I'm gonna run it.\n\n633\n00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.800\nWell, now that program is\nrunning from that USB key, and\n\n634\n00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.400\nas long as that program is open,\nI can't unmount the disk.\n\n635\n00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.100\nWhat would happen?\n\n636\n00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.800\nThe program would crash, and so\n\n637\n00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.010\nit's gonna tell me the disk is in use, and\nunfortunately, the error's a little bit\n\n638\n00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:33.590\nannoying cuz it's gonna tell me that\nthe disk is in use by some program.\n\n639\n00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:38.780\nIt's not gonna tell me what the program\nis, so if I go and take this USB key, and\n\n640\n00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:42.070\nI'll just Ctrl-Click and choose Eject.\n\n641\n00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.640\nWhen I go to Eject, it's gonna try and\neject it, and right here I get\n\n642\n00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.530\nthe disk could not be ejected because\nTerminal and Haroopad are both using it.\n\n643\n00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:53.370\nQuit those applications and\ntry to eject the disk again.\n\n644\n00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:57.180\nAll right, so it's gonna try and\ndo it for me.\n\n645\n00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:00.150\nNow, if it doesn't do it, what do I do?\n\n646\n00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:04.000\nWell, it told me the programs, I need to\ngo in and close those programs, right?\n\n647\n00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.910\nBut, there are times where it\ncan't identify the program, or\n\n648\n00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:12.290\nthe program is not responding, and when\nthat happens, when you go to eject it,\n\n649\n00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:16.800\nyou'll actually see a second button\nthat appears here that says Force Eject.\n\n650\n00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.210\nIf OS X can't identify the software,\nthe Force Eject button appears,\n\n651\n00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.010\nand it says, you know what,\nI can't identify that software, but\n\n652\n00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:27.670\nsomething's holding it open,\nwe'll kick it out for you if you want.\n\n653\n00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:30.550\nJust be aware that whatever program\nthat is is going to crash, and\n\n654\n00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.480\nso it's not something you want do,\nbut it does happen sometimes.\n\n655\n00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:37.410\nYou might have to do that in order to\nget that disk out if it's locked, or\n\n656\n00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.050\nyou could always just rip the disk\nout if it's a removable disk.\n\n657\n00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:44.540\nNot ideal, but that's effectively what\nforce ejecting is doing, is basically just\n\n658\n00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.440\nunplugging the drive while it's in use,\nwhich is not the greatest idea.\n\n659\n00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.580\nIdeally, you want to try and\nfind what it is, and\n\n660\n00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:55.240\nonce you've found what it is,\nyou can close those programs.\n\n661\n00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.695\nSo, for example, I can get out of this\nterminal, and I can get out of Roopad,\n\n662\n00:32:57.695 --> 00:33:03.660\nwherever it went, and\nI can try to get out of Roopad.\n\n663\n00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:09.960\nThere we go, and then once we were out,\nnow I should be able to eject that disk\n\n664\n00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.790\njust fine, and I'm still in it in the\nFinder, but the Finder will self-close.\n\n665\n00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:17.090\nIt's not a big deal, and then it ejects\nthat disk, so just be aware there's\n\n666\n00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.030\na Force Eject button, it just shows up\nwhen OS 10 can't recognize the software.\n\n667\n00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.140\nAll right, well, Wes, I think that's\na pretty good rundown on the file systems,\n\n668\n00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.980\neverything that we need to know for\nthe exam.\n\n669\n00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.820\nJust be aware, guys,\n\n670\n00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:31.820\nthere's a lot of file systems that are out\nthere, Apple supports a ton of them.\n\n671\n00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.946\nFor the exam, remember that OS 10 Extended\nJournaled, that's the one that we want,\n\n672\n00:33:35.946 --> 00:33:37.244\nthat's the standard one.\n\n673\n00:33:37.244 --> 00:33:41.051\nYou do have K sensitivity if you need it,\nwe can read NTFS, but\n\n674\n00:33:41.051 --> 00:33:44.873\nwe can't write to it, and\nthen we've got EXFAT and FAT32.\n\n675\n00:33:44.873 --> 00:33:47.590\nIf we want the best compatibility,\nwe can read and write to those.\n\n676\n00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.720\nIt's just not every reliable.\n\n677\n00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.450\n>> Great information, and we have come to\nthe end of another exciting episode, but\n\n678\n00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:56.310\nbefore we go, Don,\nany parting words of wisdom?\n\n679\n00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.160\n>> That's it on this one.\n\n680\n00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.690\nWe are going to do some more file system\nepisodes because I want to talk a little\n\n681\n00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:02.510\nbit more about disk encryption,\nrecovery, so\n\n682\n00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.020\nstay tuned because those\nepisodes are going to come up.\n\n683\n00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.038\nBut, as far as formatting, partitions and\ndrives, that's a pretty good wrap up.\n\n684\n00:34:07.038 --> 00:34:10.845\n>> All right, great, so we're going to\ngo ahead and sign out here at ITProTV.\n\n685\n00:34:10.845 --> 00:34:12.430\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n686\n00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:13.290\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n687\n00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:15.545\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n688\n00:34:15.545 --> 00:34:20.793\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.470\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.077\nAnd in today's episode we're\ngonna be moving forward in our\n\n5\n00:00:19.077 --> 00:00:22.246\nApple Certified Support Professional and\nwe've got none other than Mr,\n\n6\n00:00:22.246 --> 00:00:23.896\nDon Pezet in the studio to help us out.\n\n7\n00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:25.081\nDon, how you doing today, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.193\n>> I'm doing great, Wes,\nready to jump right back in.\n\n9\n00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.165\nAnd in this episode,\n\n10\n00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:31.990\nI'm actually gonna tidy up some loose\nends we had from another episode.\n\n11\n00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.680\nEarlier on in this series,\nwe talked about Apple's FileVault and\n\n12\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.860\nhow we can encrypt our hard\ndrive to protect our data.\n\n13\n00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.410\nAnd I gave some examples of why we'd wanna\ndo that in case somebody steals your hard\n\n14\n00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.410\ndrive and so on.\n\n15\n00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.160\nBut there are few\n\n16\n00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.720\nother things that I didn't get to\nthat I wanna address right here.\n\n17\n00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.350\nLike for example,\nwe saw a generating a recovery key.\n\n18\n00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.550\nBut I never showed you how to\nuse that thing once you have it.\n\n19\n00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.580\nSo maybe kinda nice to see that.\n\n20\n00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.400\nAlso I wanna talk about when you\ndecide to get rid of the computer.\n\n21\n00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.820\nMaybe you're done with it.\n\n22\n00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.780\nYou got a new computer so you gonna\ngive your old one to a friend or sell\n\n23\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.900\nit on eBay or whatever, but there's ways\nthat we can sanitize the data on our hard\n\n24\n00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.170\ndrive to make sure that other people can't\nget at it and recover that information.\n\n25\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.680\nSo, that's what we're doing right here.\n\n26\n00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.490\nWe're gonna call it data security, making\nsure that our data is nice and secure and\n\n27\n00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.780\nsafe, and that only the people\nwe want to see it can see it,\n\n28\n00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.360\nand just kinda tidy up\nsome of those loose ends.\n\n29\n00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.840\nSo, let's kick things off with a quick,\nI'll just do like a quick summary of\n\n30\n00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.040\nFile Vault because some of you guys have\nall ready seen that episode, but for those\n\n31\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.920\nof you that didn't, FileVault is Apple's\ndisk encryption that's built into OS 10.\n\n32\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.087\nAnd really ever since, I believe it\nwas 10, shoot, was it 10.5 or 10.6?\n\n33\n00:01:43.087 --> 00:01:46.421\nWe've had file vault there was an older\nform of FileVault called Legacy FileVault\n\n34\n00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:48.160\nthat we really don't see anymore.\n\n35\n00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.000\nBut the new FileVault will encrypt your\nentire hard drive and protect your data.\n\n36\n00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.620\nAnd it's super easy to turn on so there's\nreally not a reason not to be using it.\n\n37\n00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.720\nYou should use it,\nit encrypts your disk and\n\n38\n00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.240\nyou get really great security out of it.\n\n39\n00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.410\nAnd from a performance standpoint,\n\n40\n00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.180\nif I can say it, it really doesn't create\nmuch impact on your system at all.\n\n41\n00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.640\nSo once you turn it on, you're nice,\nyou're safe, you're secure and\n\n42\n00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.320\nyou just don't have to\nworry about it anymore.\n\n43\n00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.440\nSo it's an all-win kind of scenario.\n\n44\n00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.040\nThere's no real negative.\n\n45\n00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.170\nSo let's say that I wanna use FileVault.\n\n46\n00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.800\nLet's see that process\nof turning it on again.\n\n47\n00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.680\nSo I've got a machine here that\nis a stock install of El Capitan.\n\n48\n00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.180\nMy disk is not currently encrypted.\n\n49\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.630\nEven if it were, as an end user, you don't\nreally see whether it's encrypted or not.\n\n50\n00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.280\nThe way we tell is we go\ninto our System Preferences.\n\n51\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.686\nAnd in your System Preferences,\nyou can go to Security & Privacy.\n\n52\n00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:42.600\nAnd in Security & Privacy,\nyou've got the FileVault tab.\n\n53\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.140\nAll right, if your disk is encrypted,\nit'll tell you that.\n\n54\n00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.820\nBut in my case, it tells me right\nhere FileVault is turned off for\n\n55\n00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.700\nthe disk Macintosh HD, it's not encrypted.\n\n56\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.540\nSo if somebody steals my computer,\nthey could rip the hard drive out,\n\n57\n00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.210\nstick it in another computer and\nread all my data.\n\n58\n00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.640\nNo big deal there,\nthey'd be able to access that.\n\n59\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.950\nThey don't even have to\nrip the hard drive out.\n\n60\n00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.560\nThey could boot this system into recovery,\n\n61\n00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.730\nand then they'd be able to browse\nthe drive and get to everything on there.\n\n62\n00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.300\nOr they could boot from removable media,\nand get at the hard drive and\n\n63\n00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.430\nbrowse everything.\n\n64\n00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.200\nSo, my data is not safe if somebody\nhas physical access to my machine.\n\n65\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.640\nNow, if it's remote access, they have\nto have a user name and password,\n\n66\n00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.790\nI'm protected there.\n\n67\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.090\nBut if they have physical access\nto my machine, I'm not protected.\n\n68\n00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.100\nSo if I want to turn it on, well,\nI need to be an administrator so\n\n69\n00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.240\nI'm gonna unlock this panel.\n\n70\n00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.330\nAnd then you just hit Turn On FileVault.\n\n71\n00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.610\nAnd the process is super easy.\n\n72\n00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.690\nThe first thing it asks us is how\ndo we want to handle recovery?\n\n73\n00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.410\nAnd that's what we're gonna see later\nin this episode is if my system for\n\n74\n00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.820\nwhatever reason, I lose my password.\n\n75\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.850\nWell, I can't decrypt the data.\n\n76\n00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.900\nWhen you encrypt the drive,\nit generates a key.\n\n77\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.990\nAnd the key is used to\nencrypt your hard drive.\n\n78\n00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.540\nAnd then that key is attached\nto your user account.\n\n79\n00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.040\nSo when I log in with my user account, the\nkey is present, I can decrypt the drive,\n\n80\n00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.800\nand I can access the system.\n\n81\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.100\nIf I can't login as my user account,\nI can't get the key,\n\n82\n00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.630\nI can't decrypt the system,\nI'm now locked out.\n\n83\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.970\nAnd so I need a way to recover.\n\n84\n00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.150\nAnd there's two options.\n\n85\n00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.200\nOne option is to tie it to\nmy iCloud account, right?\n\n86\n00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.960\nWhat happens if you forget\nthe password to your iCloud account?\n\n87\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.660\nYou just go to Apple's website and you\nfill out the little password reset form,\n\n88\n00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.990\nyou reset your password and you're fine.\n\n89\n00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.520\nWhat happens if you forget\nthe password on your Mac?\n\n90\n00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.150\nWell, you gotta boot to recovery and\n\n91\n00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.850\ngo into the password recovery utility that\nwon't run if your drive is encrypted.\n\n92\n00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.780\nYou're just locked out,\nyou're out of luck, right?\n\n93\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.220\nSo they give you another option.\n\n94\n00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.720\nIf I choose not to use iCloud,\nI can create a recovery key.\n\n95\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.300\nAnd on the next screen\nit'll show me that key.\n\n96\n00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.430\nThis is my get out of jail free card.\n\n97\n00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.470\nIf I forget my user's password or for some\nreason can't log in as my user account,\n\n98\n00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.700\nmaybe the computer is completely dead and\nI have to take that hard drive out and\n\n99\n00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.610\nadd it to another machine,\nso I can't boot off of it.\n\n100\n00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.340\nWell, I can use this recovery\nkey to get that data.\n\n101\n00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.170\nNow, the recovery key,\nit's a long mixed code, right?\n\n102\n00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.020\nSo it's letters and numbers,\nand it's not hexadecimal.\n\n103\n00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.600\nIt's letters all the way up, and\nyou see I've got the letter P here.\n\n104\n00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.410\nSo it's all these letters and numbers.\n\n105\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.430\nAnd what you need to do is back it\nup somewhere, save it somewhere.\n\n106\n00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.010\nNow notice how Apple doesn't\ngive you a save button here,\n\n107\n00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.360\nand that's because they don't want you\nto save it right here to this computer.\n\n108\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.160\nIf I save it on this hard drive, and\nI get locked out of the hard drive,\n\n109\n00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.790\nwhat good's this code gonna do me?\n\n110\n00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.050\nNothing.\n\n111\n00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.710\nI could copy it and email it to myself,\nbut that would be bad.\n\n112\n00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.450\nBecause email's done in plain text.\n\n113\n00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.510\nAnybody could intercept that email,\nnow they've got the key,\n\n114\n00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.140\nthey could decrypt my computer.\n\n115\n00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.050\nSo ideally, you write it down on a piece\nof paper and you stick it in a safe,\n\n116\n00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.830\nyou stick it in a vault,\n\n117\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.490\nyou stick it somewhere secure\nwhere nobody can get at it.\n\n118\n00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.670\nBecause if somebody gets this key,\nthey can decrypt your drive,\n\n119\n00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.750\nthat's the recovery process I'm gonna show\na little bit later here in this episode.\n\n120\n00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.820\nThis key is really important.\n\n121\n00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.220\nNow, if you know you're never\ngonna forget your user password,\n\n122\n00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.830\nthen maybe you don't care about the key,\nand you can just hit Continue.\n\n123\n00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.840\nBut ideally, we'll write it down.\n\n124\n00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.420\nSo I'll write this key down, and\nif I ever need it, I can recover with it.\n\n125\n00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.480\nWhen we hit Continue,\nit's got all the information it needs,\n\n126\n00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.550\nwe can hit Restart and it's gonna reboot.\n\n127\n00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.860\nNow the reason it's gotta reboot, it's\ngonna encrypt the entire hard drive and\n\n128\n00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.330\nthe number of the files on the hard\ndrive are currently in use.\n\n129\n00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.220\nRight?\nSo my operating system files like\n\n130\n00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.620\nthe Kernel and the UI and stuff,\nthey're in use, they can't be encrypted.\n\n131\n00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.670\nSo it's gotta reboot so\nthat those files won't be in use and\n\n132\n00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.260\nthen it will encrypt those files.\n\n133\n00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.110\nAnd once they're encrypted, then it can\nboot the rest of the operating system and\n\n134\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.040\nit'll just encrypt that as it has time,\nright.\n\n135\n00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.130\nSo this is gonna boot up and\ni'm gonna get to my desktop and\n\n136\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.780\nI can start using the Mac, but\nit's not actually done, right.\n\n137\n00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.690\nIt could take,\non a brand new, empty system,\n\n138\n00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.350\nit usually takes about 15 minutes\nto encrypt the hard drive.\n\n139\n00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.490\nBut a business system that\nI've been using for months or\n\n140\n00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.460\nyears, it could take hours upon\nhours to encrypt the drive.\n\n141\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.550\nWell, you can still use your\ncomputer while it's encrypting,\n\n142\n00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.670\nit'll just keep running in\nthe background and get encrypted, but\n\n143\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.410\nyou need to monitor it, and\nwatch and see whether or\n\n144\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.150\nnot it's finished encrypting, and\nit'll give you a little status bar.\n\n145\n00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.950\nYou just go into your System Preferences,\ngo into Privacy and\n\n146\n00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.450\nSecurity, go to the FileVault tab, and\n\n147\n00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.530\nyou'll see that little status\nbar until it's finally complete.\n\n148\n00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:13.630\nOnce it's complete your entire hard drive\nis encrypted, and you're in business.\n\n149\n00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.610\nSo that process is pretty straightforward.\n\n150\n00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.430\nNow I don't wanna wait for this\nmachine to actually finish encrypting,\n\n151\n00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.910\ncuz I'm an impatient person.\n\n152\n00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.650\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna switch\nto another machine that's already\n\n153\n00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.840\nencrypted, and\nwe'll use this one to be able to see that.\n\n154\n00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.540\nSo here I've got a machine that, again,\nit's another stock install of El Capitan.\n\n155\n00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.350\nI guess I have a couple\nextra hard drives on it, but\n\n156\n00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.220\nthis one's already\nencrypted with FileVault.\n\n157\n00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.540\nAnd I can verify that by going into system\npreferences, and going into security and\n\n158\n00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.620\nprivacy, and\ngoing in the FileVault tab, and\n\n159\n00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.070\nright here I can see FileVault is\nturned on for the disk Macintosh HD.\n\n160\n00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.970\nAnd a recovery key has been set.\n\n161\n00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.679\nThere is a recovery key somewhere that\nwill allow me to recover the system if I\n\n162\n00:07:53.679 --> 00:07:54.274\nneed to.\n\n163\n00:07:54.274 --> 00:07:55.688\nIt's not tied to an iCloud account,\n\n164\n00:07:55.688 --> 00:07:57.566\nthat would be the other\nthing you would see here.\n\n165\n00:07:57.566 --> 00:08:01.293\nNow as long as I can\nprovide a valid user name.\n\n166\n00:08:01.293 --> 00:08:03.802\nI'm gonna be able to\nlog in to this system,\n\n167\n00:08:03.802 --> 00:08:07.640\nI'm gonna be able to access\nthe data on the drive.\n\n168\n00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.380\nIf I can't provide a valid username,\nthen I've got a problem.\n\n169\n00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.840\nSo for example, if I reboot this computer,\nI'm gonna restart.\n\n170\n00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.400\nLogging out's not enough, if I log out,\n\n171\n00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.200\nI've already cleared FileVault at that\npoint, so I'm already past the encryption.\n\n172\n00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.220\nBut if I reboot, when it goes to boot,\nit doesn't boot from the Macintosh HD\n\n173\n00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.970\nanymore, it boots from the little UEFI\npartition, is what it boots from.\n\n174\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:35.230\nAnd then, it hits a special partition that\nhas the stripped down operating system\n\n175\n00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.600\nthat FileVault uses.\n\n176\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.080\nAnd that's why my login screen looks so\ndifferent.\n\n177\n00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.560\nMy normal login screen has a nice gray\nbackground that actually fits the screen.\n\n178\n00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.310\nSo I've got black bars\non the side of this one,\n\n179\n00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.830\nthat's because it hasn't loaded\nall the video card drivers yet.\n\n180\n00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.450\nIt's not supporting all\nthat extra screen space.\n\n181\n00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:55.550\nAnd, my icon here for my user account\nshows up, but the screen looks different.\n\n182\n00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.300\nNormally I have a little back arrow\nthat I can hit here to provide\n\n183\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.230\nother user credentials, I don't have that.\n\n184\n00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.440\nAnd that's because this is not Mac OS,\nthis is FileVault.\n\n185\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.470\nI've booted a small\nFileVault operating system\n\n186\n00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.240\nthat's going to allow me to decrypt\nthe drive, and then we can boot the OS.\n\n187\n00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.430\nI can't boot the OS right now\nbecause it's encrypted, and\n\n188\n00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.940\nI can't decrypt it unless\nI have valid credentials.\n\n189\n00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:23.150\nNow, if I know my password, I just\npunch that in right here and I log in.\n\n190\n00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.800\nMy password opens up my account,\nmy account can see the encryption key.\n\n191\n00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.570\nThe encryption key lets me decrypt\nthe drive and I boot up and\n\n192\n00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.760\neverything's happy.\n\n193\n00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.570\nThe end user just sees a login screen,\nthey don't notice this is different.\n\n194\n00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.210\nThey log in like normal,\nthey use the system,\n\n195\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.150\nthey don't recognize that\nthe encryption is even there.\n\n196\n00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.000\nAnd that's the best part,\nwe want it to be transparent.\n\n197\n00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.310\nBut if I boot to recovery,\nI can't read this disk.\n\n198\n00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.280\nIf I boot to this screen and\nI can't provide a username and\n\n199\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.960\na password, then I'm not gonna\nbe able to read this disk.\n\n200\n00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.460\nSo that's where we need to recover,\nthat's where the recovery key comes in.\n\n201\n00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.000\nAnd it's not immediately\nobvious what to do here.\n\n202\n00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.030\nIf I put the wrong password in,\nit just tells me it's a wrong password.\n\n203\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:08.440\nBut, what you can do is this little\nquestion mark right here, so on\n\n204\n00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.218\nthat password field, see how it's asking\nme to enter my password, whoa, sorry guys.\n\n205\n00:10:12.218 --> 00:10:14.290\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna get motion sickness.\n\n206\n00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.270\nIt's asking me to enter my password,\nand there's this little question mark.\n\n207\n00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.220\nWell it's not immediately obvious\nwhat that question mark is.\n\n208\n00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.140\nIt's Help,\ndo I need help to type in my password?\n\n209\n00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.540\nWell yes actually you do,\nif you don't know your password.\n\n210\n00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.840\nIf you click on that question mark,\nwhich I'm really gonna try and do here.\n\n211\n00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.820\nThere we go.\n\n212\n00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:36.320\nIf you forgot your password,\nyou can reset it using your Recovery Key.\n\n213\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.430\nThis is where the Recovery Key comes in.\n\n214\n00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.170\nYou can click the little play button right\nthere, and now it's gonna ask us for\n\n215\n00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.200\nthe recovery key.\n\n216\n00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.310\nAnd if you've written it down,\nlike conveniently I did,\n\n217\n00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.238\nI can type in that recovery key\nto get in without my password.\n\n218\n00:10:50.238 --> 00:10:54.290\nSo, I'm gonna come in here and type it\nand, shoot, I didn't denote whether these\n\n219\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.120\nwere zero's or o's, so we might have\na little bit of guesswork here.\n\n220\n00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.110\nSo, I'm just gonna type in\nmy recovery key and it's\n\n221\n00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.670\ngonna be different than the recovery key\nyou saw on the screen just a minute ago,\n\n222\n00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.330\nbecause this is a different machine,\nthis is one I encrypted earlier.\n\n223\n00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.770\nSo, I'm just gonna punch in its key.\n\n224\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.450\nAnd you don't have to worry\nabout case sensitivity,\n\n225\n00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.810\nit's gonna make it all capitals for you.\n\n226\n00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.290\nAnd so I'm just gonna get in here and\ntype that, and\n\n227\n00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.269\nI'm gonna assume these are all zeros.\n\n228\n00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:27.860\nThat's not right,,\nlet's see C69, it is 6C69.\n\n229\n00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.510\nYou kind of have to have it right or\nit doesn't work so\n\n230\n00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.710\nI'm trying to get it right.\n\n231\n00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.530\nThere we go.\n\n232\n00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:38.780\nSo I'm typing in my recovery key and\nonce I type that I can move forward and\n\n233\n00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.390\nassuming it's correct, I'm logging in.\n\n234\n00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.520\nI can decrypt the drive because\nI've got that recovery key.\n\n235\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.550\nThat's what it's letting me do.\n\n236\n00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.470\nIt's gonna let me decrypt the drive,\nand I can get in.\n\n237\n00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.470\nAnd now I can reset my password or\nwhatever else it is I need.\n\n238\n00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.740\n>> Now Don, you said that we couldn't get\ninto the drive in recovery mode, right?\n\n239\n00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.020\nI don't have your password,\nI don't have your recovery key.\n\n240\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.950\nBut you've showed in some other episodes,\nhow I can make your drive, if I\n\n241\n00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.670\nput my black hat on and steal your laptop,\nlook like a drive through target mode.\n\n242\n00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.120\nCan I see anything in target mode?\n\n243\n00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.810\n>> So if I try and\nboot this system in target mode, so\n\n244\n00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:15.480\nif I hold down the letter t while I boot\nup, it's gonna take that hard drive and\n\n245\n00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.290\nit's gonna mount it to FireWire or\nThunderbolt, right?\n\n246\n00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.690\nWell, not this time.\n\n247\n00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.840\nWhat it's gonna do is, you're gonna\nhold down t and when it comes up\n\n248\n00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.600\nit's gonna ask for a username and password\ncuz it's gotta decrypt the drive first.\n\n249\n00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.400\nAnd if you can't do that,\nit can't decrypt it and\n\n250\n00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.380\ntarget drive will show no hard drives.\n\n251\n00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.520\nSo you'll have to put that in\nin order to gain that access.\n\n252\n00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.480\n>> I really like playing\nthe bad guy here too.\n\n253\n00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.010\nSo I steal your laptop,\nI rip the hard drive out,\n\n254\n00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.910\nI slave it into another machine, what\nare my chances of getting into that drive?\n\n255\n00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.110\n>> The drive's encrypted so you see\na bunch of encrypted garbage in there.\n\n256\n00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.570\nSo unless you can just\nmiraculously guess what the key is\n\n257\n00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:48.790\nthen you're not gonna\nbe able to get there.\n\n258\n00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.560\nAnd you guys saw the key is long and\nit's mixed case.\n\n259\n00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.080\nSo to brute force a key like that\nwould take a long, long time.\n\n260\n00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.640\nIt can be done,\ndon't think it's impossible.\n\n261\n00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.900\nAs computers get more advanced, as our\nprocessors get faster, it is possible.\n\n262\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.790\nAnd that's why Apple is steadily working\non improving that security, increasing\n\n263\n00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.370\nthat encryption strength, version after\nversion to make it better and better.\n\n264\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.100\nNow on my system it did boot up.\n\n265\n00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.340\nAnd I put that recovery key in, and\n\n266\n00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.820\nyou'll see here where now it's\ntelling me I can reset my password.\n\n267\n00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:24.260\nSo if I didn't know my password before,\nI can punch in my password now.\n\n268\n00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.360\nA password that I know at least,\nI can try.\n\n269\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:31.390\nAnd then once I've got that I can reset\nit, and now I'm able to get logged in.\n\n270\n00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.560\nBut it took having that\nrecovery key to do this.\n\n271\n00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.950\nIf I didn't have the recovery\nkey this wouldn't have worked.\n\n272\n00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.470\nAnd now, I get my system back.\n\n273\n00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.900\nSo that's using the recovery key,\nit's pretty important.\n\n274\n00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:46.660\nAny time you boot into recovery,\nboot off a removable media,\n\n275\n00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.020\nboot without password like this, you're\neither gonna need a valid username and\n\n276\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.930\npassword or\nyou're gonna need the recovery key.\n\n277\n00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.400\n>> In a previous episode, Don, one of the\nthings you showed us is that we can have\n\n278\n00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.580\nmultiple users with more than\none user on a machine, so\n\n279\n00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:04.080\nDon's logged in, I'm sharing the computer,\nyou've encrypted it with FileVault too,\n\n280\n00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.390\nme as a user, what can I expect to see?\n\n281\n00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.000\n>> Pretty much the same thing.\n\n282\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.720\nSo the users,\nas you create those user accounts,\n\n283\n00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.900\nthey get that key attached to them also,\nso they're able to log in with the system.\n\n284\n00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.850\nIf they're admins they can get right in.\n\n285\n00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.340\nIf they're standard users,\n\n286\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.640\nwe actually have some different\nvariations that we can do there.\n\n287\n00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.490\nWhere for example, an administrator\nhas to unlock the drive and\n\n288\n00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.120\nthen the standard user can log in.\n\n289\n00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.300\nSo you see different behaviors like that.\n\n290\n00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.590\nBut for the most part,\nthe users get the same experience.\n\n291\n00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.900\nThey see that log in screen,\nthey punch in their password,\n\n292\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.320\nthey jump right into the system.\n\n293\n00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.700\nAnd that's kind of the end of it.\n\n294\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.230\nIt's a great technology,\nit's super easy to turn on.\n\n295\n00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.840\nAnd the security benefits alone are so\ngreat that it's worth doing,\n\n296\n00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.080\nespecially on a mobile device,\na device that you could lose.\n\n297\n00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.120\nIf somebody stole my laptop, well if\nthey know my password, if they can get\n\n298\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.330\nlogged in, I've got Dropbox on here,\nI've synchronized my own files.\n\n299\n00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.350\nIf they can get in here and start messing\nwith those files, that would be bad.\n\n300\n00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.760\nNow, I don't have credit card data\non here, so it's not that bad.\n\n301\n00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.290\nBut, your personal information,\nmaybe you have your tax returns on there.\n\n302\n00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.690\nYou don't want that\nstuff getting out there.\n\n303\n00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:02.420\n>> In a previous episode, Don, one of\nthe things that you had told us about is\n\n304\n00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.390\nthe type of encryption that we can\nexpect to see on these drives.\n\n305\n00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.640\nWell, maybe one of our viewers out there,\nsome of viewers,\n\n306\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.600\nhaven't seen that episode.\n\n307\n00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.564\nCan you tell us just a little bit about\nthe encryption that we can expect?\n\n308\n00:15:10.564 --> 00:15:12.376\n>> Yes, it's AES-128.\n\n309\n00:15:12.376 --> 00:15:15.530\nSo it's pretty strong encryption and it's\nbasically running that across the drive.\n\n310\n00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.860\nAnd that means the key strength that it is\nusing is actually 128-bit key strength.\n\n311\n00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.280\nAnd it's a very strong form of encryption,\nit really does protect that data.\n\n312\n00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.420\nAnd it’s one that Apple chose because it\ngive the best tradeoff between performance\n\n313\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.510\nand strength.\n\n314\n00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.270\nAnd we have Intel processors\nin our Macs now and\n\n315\n00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:36.250\nIntel actually has hardware acceleration\nfor AES built right into the chip and\n\n316\n00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.810\nthat’s why we can to this with next-to-no\nperformance hit, because the processor is\n\n317\n00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.390\nspecifically designed to be able to\ndo that and it does work really well.\n\n318\n00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:44.270\nIt's impressive technology.\n\n319\n00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.440\nAll right, now encrypting our disc,\nthat protects our data.\n\n320\n00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.720\nMakes it safe, makes it where if somebody\nsteals this I know my data's safe.\n\n321\n00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.830\nI don't even have to worry about it.\n\n322\n00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.646\nThey stole my laptop, well it stinks.\n\n323\n00:15:55.646 --> 00:15:57.856\nI'm gotta get a new laptop but\nat least I know my data's safe.\n\n324\n00:15:57.856 --> 00:16:00.843\nEven though they've got it I no longer\nhave physical control of the device.\n\n325\n00:16:00.843 --> 00:16:06.115\nBut, what if I'm intentionally\ngiving my laptop to somebody else?\n\n326\n00:16:06.115 --> 00:16:07.941\nSo maybe I go and I buy a new laptop, and\n\n327\n00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:12.590\nI decide that I'm gonna give my old laptop\nto Wes, I want Wes to have this laptop.\n\n328\n00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.314\nBut I want my data to be safe.\n\n329\n00:16:14.314 --> 00:16:16.784\nWell, I've got FileVault on here,\nif I give it to him,\n\n330\n00:16:16.784 --> 00:16:19.530\nI'm gonna have to give him my password so\nhe can get logged in.\n\n331\n00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:20.920\nAnd if he logs in, now he's got my files.\n\n332\n00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.231\nSo I don't want that, right.\n\n333\n00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:24.970\nSo I'm gonna have to turn FileVault off.\n\n334\n00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.800\nWell, if I turn FileVault off,\nthen all my data's there and it's exposed,\n\n335\n00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.010\nthen it can be read.\n\n336\n00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.270\nSo I need to format or erase the disk.\n\n337\n00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.080\nNow when you plug in\na disk to your system,\n\n338\n00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.915\nI'll just take this USB disk that I've\ngot here and I'm gonna plug it in.\n\n339\n00:16:37.915 --> 00:16:40.520\nOr I guess I could just use one of\nthese little disks sitting right here.\n\n340\n00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.410\nI've got these two.\n\n341\n00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.050\nSo for example, this storage one.\n\n342\n00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.536\nIt doesn't have anything on it,\nso we'll say I go into all copy.\n\n343\n00:16:47.536 --> 00:16:49.464\niBooks is usually my target for\ncopying stuff.\n\n344\n00:16:49.464 --> 00:16:50.640\nSo I'm gonna copy iBooks to it.\n\n345\n00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.446\nSo here's this disk, Storage 1,\nand I've got iBooks copied to it.\n\n346\n00:16:55.446 --> 00:16:56.850\nIt's sitting right there.\n\n347\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.310\nAnd this is a removal disk I\nwanna take in and give it to Wes.\n\n348\n00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.950\nBut I want it to be clean.\n\n349\n00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.570\nI don't want him to be able\nto recover data off of it.\n\n350\n00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:08.720\nAnd I know that I can fire up the disk\nutility, and in the disk utility,\n\n351\n00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.630\nI can choose that Storage 1 disk and\nI can choose Erase.\n\n352\n00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.315\nAnd if I erase it, so I'm just gonna\nerase that, it's gonna wipe it out, and\n\n353\n00:17:16.315 --> 00:17:20.350\nthen when it's done, I can open up\nthat Storage 1, and it's empty.\n\n354\n00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.676\nSo now I'm giving him an empty disk.\n\n355\n00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:23.580\nBut it's Wes.\n\n356\n00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.511\nWes, maybe he decides that he wants\nto do a little experiment, so\n\n357\n00:17:27.511 --> 00:17:31.935\nhe plugs that disk in and he fires up\na program like DiskWarrior, right.\n\n358\n00:17:31.935 --> 00:17:35.390\nDiskWarrior's a really cool software\ncuz it'll scan that hard drive and\n\n359\n00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.250\nit'll dig deep and it'll look to see if\nthere's data remnants still left behind.\n\n360\n00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.580\nWhen you write files to a disk,\n\n361\n00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.430\nthe name of the file is stored in\na little table at the center of the disk.\n\n362\n00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.690\nBut the data for that file is\nstored all over the disk somewhere.\n\n363\n00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:54.140\nWhen you delete a file, it normally\njust flags the name as deleted, but\n\n364\n00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.110\nthe data itself is still sitting there.\n\n365\n00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:00.830\nSo even though it looks nice and erased,\nmy data's still there on the back end, and\n\n366\n00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.860\nanybody running forensics software or\n\n367\n00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:07.720\nrepair software like DiscWarrior can\nscan the disc and recover those files.\n\n368\n00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.383\nSo if I'm gonna sell this on eBay,\nI don't know who's gonna get it.\n\n369\n00:18:10.383 --> 00:18:12.410\nI want to make sure that doesn't happen.\n\n370\n00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:16.300\n>> Is it safe to say, Don, that when you\ndo an erase like we've just seen here that\n\n371\n00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.530\nit's really just the operating\nsystem's kinda blind to it anymore?\n\n372\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.140\nThe data, like you said,\nis still there and\n\n373\n00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.540\nwe're really just removing the ability\nto see it via the operating system?\n\n374\n00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.290\n>> Yeah, it's not so much the operating\nsystem as it is the file system.\n\n375\n00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.770\nSo if I were to move it to other machines,\nthey wouldn't see it either.\n\n376\n00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:35.550\nThe data's effectively gone and\nit can be overwritten at any moment.\n\n377\n00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.275\nSo if I start copying data to this,\nit could override that data and\n\n378\n00:18:38.275 --> 00:18:38.930\nit can be gone.\n\n379\n00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:43.123\nRight now, the FBI, the CIA, those guys,\nthey've got some really impressive\n\n380\n00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:47.780\nsoftware that can scan and recover files\neven if it’s been overwritten a few times.\n\n381\n00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.180\nSo we have to be careful with that.\n\n382\n00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.420\nHow do we know, I'm not saying we need\nto hide from the FBI and the CIA,\n\n383\n00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.200\nI'm just saying, if you sell\na hard drive or sell a computer on\n\n384\n00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.410\na third party market, and you don't know\nwho's gonna end up with ownership of it.\n\n385\n00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.270\nHow do you make sure that\nthey can't get at your data?\n\n386\n00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.450\nWell, the default erase doesn't do that.\n\n387\n00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.740\nYou're not gonna guarantee\nthat protection.\n\n388\n00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.643\nIf you're just trying to get a fresh and\nclean system for\n\n389\n00:19:09.643 --> 00:19:10.788\nyourself that's fine, right.\n\n390\n00:19:10.788 --> 00:19:13.610\nOr if you're giving it to a family\nmember maybe you don't care.\n\n391\n00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:17.400\nBut if you have no idea who that person\nis, you need to ensure the data is gone.\n\n392\n00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:22.226\nAnd so in Mac OS we actually have the\noption to do what’s called a Secure Erase.\n\n393\n00:19:22.226 --> 00:19:27.566\nAnd you might remember we saw\nSecure Erase briefly in the user episode,\n\n394\n00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:32.730\nwhen I went into System Preferences and\ncreated some user accounts.\n\n395\n00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.840\nSo it was an episode where\nI showed deleting a user.\n\n396\n00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.800\nAnd there was an option that I\nmentioned really briefly in there,\n\n397\n00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.520\nI didn't spent a lot of time on it,\nlet me just bring it up here again,\n\n398\n00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.480\nthat every user has a home folder.\n\n399\n00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.469\nSo if I create a folder for Wes,\nor create a user account for\n\n400\n00:19:46.469 --> 00:19:49.760\nWes, he's gonna have a home\nfolder on my hard drive.\n\n401\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.440\nAnd if I delete his account,\nI don't need his account anymore.\n\n402\n00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.380\nWell it's gonna delete\nhis home folder too.\n\n403\n00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.700\nAnd when we delete that home folder,\nso if I just delete him right here.\n\n404\n00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.170\nAnd I choose to delete the home folder,\n\n405\n00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.360\nsee how it's got Erase\nhome folder securely?\n\n406\n00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.970\nWhat's that talking about?\n\n407\n00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.110\nWell normally it just flags\nhis home folder as deleted,\n\n408\n00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.300\nit's gone from the OS but I can still\nrecover it if I had forensic software.\n\n409\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.440\nErase it securely.\n\n410\n00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.385\nWhat it's gonna do, is it's gonna take all\nthe blocks in the hard drive where his\n\n411\n00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:21.307\ndata's written to and\nit's gonna write zeros to all of it.\n\n412\n00:20:21.307 --> 00:20:22.818\nAnd then it's gonna do it again.\n\n413\n00:20:22.818 --> 00:20:24.211\nAnd then it's gonna do it again.\n\n414\n00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:26.573\nAnd by writing those zeros over and\nover and\n\n415\n00:20:26.573 --> 00:20:29.524\nover again,\nit insures that all his data is gone, and\n\n416\n00:20:29.524 --> 00:20:33.810\nthat even people running forensics\nsoftware can't dig those files back up.\n\n417\n00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.860\nNow that's just his home folder.\n\n418\n00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.350\nBut you can do an entire hard drive.\n\n419\n00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:43.970\nIf I go back to my disc utility and\nI choose that Storage 1 disc, so\n\n420\n00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.680\nthis is a removable disc, I'm about to\ngive it to somebody so they can use it.\n\n421\n00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.900\nI come up and I choose Erase.\n\n422\n00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:53.040\nWhen you go to Erase, it's just gonna do\nthat standard let's flag everything as\n\n423\n00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.640\ndeleted and that's it, it will\nrebuild the file table and that's it.\n\n424\n00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.700\nBut if you go to the disk here, so\n\n425\n00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.180\nI'm gonna choose the actual disk and\ngo into Erase.\n\n426\n00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.420\nAnd shoot, you know what?\n\n427\n00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.350\nActually I'm not,\nwhy am I not seeing my option?\n\n428\n00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.690\nWell, for some reason my virtual machine\ndoesn't wanna show me the option.\n\n429\n00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.200\nI'm just gonna jump over to my regular\ndesktop and I'll show you here.\n\n430\n00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.470\nI've got that USB drive\nattached to my system.\n\n431\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:22.030\nAnd again let's say I wanna take this\nUSB drive and give it to somebody.\n\n432\n00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:22.980\nGive it to Wes or whoever.\n\n433\n00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.770\nSo I wanna Secure Erase that.\n\n434\n00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.130\nAnd the option that I'm looking for is,\n\n435\n00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.210\nwhat you should be able to\ndo is choose the drive.\n\n436\n00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.210\nAnd when you choose Erase, there it is.\n\n437\n00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.610\nIn my virtual machine,\nI just said Cancel and Erase.\n\n438\n00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:36.700\nBut here on my actual desktop\nI've got security options.\n\n439\n00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.000\nThat's what I'm looking for.\n\n440\n00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.842\nIf I just hit Erase,\nit does the standard erase.\n\n441\n00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:44.080\nIt's just going to wipe that disk,\nbut not really wipe it.\n\n442\n00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.650\nThe data's technically still there and\nsoftware could recover that and\n\n443\n00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:48.580\nbring it back.\n\n444\n00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.520\nBut if I had security options, say I was\nshowing it set to the fastest option, and\n\n445\n00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.270\nit says this option does not\nsecurely erase files on the disk.\n\n446\n00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.527\nA disk recovery application might\nbe able to recover the files.\n\n447\n00:21:58.527 --> 00:22:01.620\nRight, that's what it does by default,\ncuz it's fast.\n\n448\n00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.590\nBut I have three more choices\nthat I can move through, and\n\n449\n00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:09.930\nthe very first choice does\nwhat's called a write pass.\n\n450\n00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:16.040\nIt does one pass of random data across\nthat drive to overwrite what I've got.\n\n451\n00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.030\nIt's ensuring that every sector gets\nwritten to at least one time, to make sure\n\n452\n00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:23.690\nthat if somebody runs recovery software,\nthey might not be able to recover data.\n\n453\n00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:24.980\nBut they might still.\n\n454\n00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.687\nThis might not be enough.\n\n455\n00:22:26.687 --> 00:22:28.893\nAnd I said one time,\nactually it does it two times.\n\n456\n00:22:28.893 --> 00:22:31.250\nSo it says it's gonna write\nover the data two times.\n\n457\n00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.450\nSo it's gonna take that and\nhopefully give us that level.\n\n458\n00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.510\nBut the Department of Energy and\nthe Department of Defense,\n\n459\n00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.510\nthey have their own standards, and their\nown standards are a little bit stronger.\n\n460\n00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.230\nSo if I continue to slide over,\nwe'll see the DOE right here.\n\n461\n00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:47.130\nThis is a DOE compliant\n3-pass secure erase.\n\n462\n00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:49.240\nSo instead of the normal 2-pass,\n\n463\n00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.380\nthis one is gonna be a 3-pass\nto get in there and erase it.\n\n464\n00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:57.270\nAnd then Most Secure, if I go up to that\none, this is the Department of Defense\n\n465\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:01.250\nstandard and\nyou'll see it's doing a seven time pass.\n\n466\n00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:05.940\nIt's gonna write to every single\nbit seven times, ones and zeros,\n\n467\n00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.240\nrandom data, to make sure that\nnobody can recover this information.\n\n468\n00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.780\nThis way I can assure that when I give\nthis disc to someone else, they won't be\n\n469\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:18.120\nable to run forensic software and\nlift my old deleted data off of it.\n\n470\n00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:23.410\nNow, as you pick the stronger ones notice\nhow this lowest one is labelled fastest.\n\n471\n00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.230\nHow fast did it erase that drive?\n\n472\n00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.190\nIt just took seconds and it was erased.\n\n473\n00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.470\nSo if I choose that option,\nthe default, and\n\n474\n00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.080\nI hit Erase it's gonna erase\nthat thing super fast.\n\n475\n00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.710\nThere, done.\n\n476\n00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:35.480\nIt just took a few seconds.\n\n477\n00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.920\nBut when I choose the stronger levels,\nso if I do\n\n478\n00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:45.840\nthe two pass, and\nI start that one erasing.\n\n479\n00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.820\nHere it goes, starting Secure Erase.\n\n480\n00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:52.235\nIf I drop it down I can see it's starting\nthe Secure Erase, and now we wait.\n\n481\n00:23:52.235 --> 00:23:56.498\nThat drive's 128 gigs, so\nit's a pretty small drive.\n\n482\n00:23:56.498 --> 00:24:01.285\nIt is an SSD drive hooked up with USB 3.0,\nso that's pretty fast, But\n\n483\n00:24:01.285 --> 00:24:05.298\nI'm gonna be waiting awhile,\nand this is just the two pass.\n\n484\n00:24:05.298 --> 00:24:09.950\nImagine if I did the seven pass, this\ncould take hours upon hours upon hours.\n\n485\n00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.260\nSo this is one of those things where\nyou start up and then go have dinner,\n\n486\n00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.260\ngo to bed, come back the next day and\ncheck and it'll be done.\n\n487\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.770\nIt takes a long time.\n\n488\n00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:20.630\nI've got pretty much the fastest\ndrive I can have attached here,\n\n489\n00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.460\nand it's taking a long time.\n\n490\n00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.050\nThe bigger the drive,\nthe longer it'll take.\n\n491\n00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.400\nIf it's a terabyte drive, be ready,\nit's gonna take a long time.\n\n492\n00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.770\nOn a seven pass, it could take 24 hours,\nbut your data is safe,\n\n493\n00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.450\nthat's the trade-off that you make.\n\n494\n00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:38.093\nYou wanna make sure that your data is safe\nand intact, so that you don't lose it.\n\n495\n00:24:38.093 --> 00:24:40.669\nNow, another thing to be careful with,\nI mentioned I've got an SSD.\n\n496\n00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:43.084\nSSDs have a lifetime.\n\n497\n00:24:43.084 --> 00:24:44.072\nThey only last so long.\n\n498\n00:24:44.072 --> 00:24:46.103\nThey only support so\nmany reads and writes.\n\n499\n00:24:46.103 --> 00:24:50.088\nAnd when I do the secure pass I'm reading\nand writing to every single sector,\n\n500\n00:24:50.088 --> 00:24:52.436\nbut it is only seven times so\nit's not so bad.\n\n501\n00:24:52.436 --> 00:24:54.464\nBut if you do enough of\nthese erases over time,\n\n502\n00:24:54.464 --> 00:24:56.754\nyou can start to shorten\nthe lifetime of your drive,\n\n503\n00:24:56.754 --> 00:24:59.880\nso you want to make sure you don't\ngo too crazy with the things.\n\n504\n00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.850\nBut, this will secure erase this one and\neventually it'll be ready.\n\n505\n00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.090\nBut yeah.\n\n506\n00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.800\nA two pass, a three pass,\nthat's good enough for most people.\n\n507\n00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.070\nDepartment of Defense,\nyou're talking about sensitive data and so\n\n508\n00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.410\nthey go seven pass.\n\n509\n00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:12.660\nAnd a lot of times they\ndon't even do that.\n\n510\n00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.683\nIf you talk to people in\nthe Department of Defense,\n\n511\n00:25:14.683 --> 00:25:16.386\nthey normally destroy their hard drives.\n\n512\n00:25:16.386 --> 00:25:19.184\nThere's not enough passes in the world\nto guarantee the data is safe.\n\n513\n00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:22.880\nBut if you destroy the drive,\nthat's a guarantee.\n\n514\n00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.390\nAll right, so that is how we\ncan securely erase that stuff.\n\n515\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.856\nI think that's about all I've got.\n\n516\n00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:33.559\n>> You know, Don, I do have one question.\n\n517\n00:25:33.559 --> 00:25:35.485\nOne of the things that I do a lot is,\n\n518\n00:25:35.485 --> 00:25:39.354\nI put files that I don't want on my\nMac anymore, I put it in the trash.\n\n519\n00:25:39.354 --> 00:25:43.336\nWhat happens to those files once I right\nclick on it and I delete the trash?\n\n520\n00:25:43.336 --> 00:25:45.600\nAre they still there,\ncan they still be recovered as well?\n\n521\n00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.488\nIs it no different?\n\n522\n00:25:46.488 --> 00:25:47.649\n>> It's a little bit different.\n\n523\n00:25:47.649 --> 00:25:49.925\nWhen you put them in the trash,\nthe files still exist.\n\n524\n00:25:49.925 --> 00:25:52.444\nYou can actually browse to it and\nsee it in the operating system,\n\n525\n00:25:52.444 --> 00:25:54.180\nyou still have that visibility.\n\n526\n00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.960\nWhen you empty the trash,\nthat's when it actually gets deleted.\n\n527\n00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.050\nAnd that's the one I'm talking about where\nthe file name is now marked as deleted,\n\n528\n00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:03.610\nand the file's hidden from the operating\nsystem but it can still be recovered.\n\n529\n00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:06.680\nSo if it's in the trash,\nyou've got no protection whatsoever.\n\n530\n00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.460\nIf it's deleted, at least it's hidden.\n\n531\n00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:12.390\nAnd somebody would have to work at\nleast a little bit harder to do it.\n\n532\n00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.530\nNow, this secure erase is gonna happen and\nit's gonna kinda churn along.\n\n533\n00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.151\nThere's one more thing\nI wanted to show you.\n\n534\n00:26:17.151 --> 00:26:21.517\nI chose the volume and I hit erase,\nand so it's gonna churn along and\n\n535\n00:26:21.517 --> 00:26:24.200\ntake its time and eventually do this.\n\n536\n00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.341\nI'm gonna get impatient, you know what,\nI'm just gonna break the rules and\n\n537\n00:26:27.341 --> 00:26:30.674\nunplug that thing, because I wanna show\nyou there is another option that pops up,\n\n538\n00:26:30.674 --> 00:26:33.600\nand that disk is gonna be corrupted now,\nso I'll have to recover that.\n\n539\n00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.651\nBut if I had done the erase\non the drive itself,\n\n540\n00:26:36.651 --> 00:26:42.284\nthere's another option where it asks about\nwhether you want to erase the free space,\n\n541\n00:26:42.284 --> 00:26:45.040\nthe empty space on that disk, all right?\n\n542\n00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.210\nIf there's empty space that hasn't been\nwritten to, do we need to erase it?\n\n543\n00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:50.840\nWell, there's a bit of a debate on that.\n\n544\n00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.310\nSome people say yes,\nsome people say no, right?\n\n545\n00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:58.137\nIf I have a 200 GB drive, and I've written\n20 GB of data to it, well technically I\n\n546\n00:26:58.137 --> 00:27:02.849\nonly need to do the secure scrub on the 20\nGB, that'll make it go faster, right?\n\n547\n00:27:02.849 --> 00:27:06.136\nBut if somebody were to intercept this,\nthey'd kind of have an idea that I had at\n\n548\n00:27:06.136 --> 00:27:08.805\nleast 20 GB of data on there, so\nat least that kinda leaks out.\n\n549\n00:27:08.805 --> 00:27:10.710\nBut the free space we\ndon't necessarily scrub.\n\n550\n00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:15.440\nWell, you might want to scrub\nthat free space to make sure\n\n551\n00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.209\nthat that's completely clear.\n\n552\n00:27:18.209 --> 00:27:21.090\nNow, people can't even tell how\nmuch data you had on there.\n\n553\n00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:25.930\nSo if I had chosen the erase from the\ndrive controller itself, from the hardware\n\n554\n00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.340\ndrive instead of the volume, then I would\nhave had that option about the free space\n\n555\n00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.290\nbut I didn't do it and now that I've\ninappropriately remove the drive,\n\n556\n00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:34.840\nit's not gonna come back up for\nme because I've damaged the disk.\n\n557\n00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:39.688\nSo, I'll have to go into the disk\nutility and run a repair on that one.\n\n558\n00:27:39.688 --> 00:27:41.023\nBut, actually, it's sort of coming back.\n\n559\n00:27:41.023 --> 00:27:42.231\nIt's definitely not happy.\n\n560\n00:27:42.231 --> 00:27:44.843\nSo you can see it,\nit recognizes my controller now.\n\n561\n00:27:44.843 --> 00:27:47.338\nBut the partition is\nkinda grayed out here and\n\n562\n00:27:47.338 --> 00:27:49.710\nunhappy because of\nthe way I yanked it out.\n\n563\n00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.462\nBut when we go to erase these things,\nyou have.\n\n564\n00:27:52.462 --> 00:27:54.099\nShoot.\nNow, it doesn't even show the partition.\n\n565\n00:27:54.099 --> 00:27:54.958\nSo, yeah.\n\n566\n00:27:54.958 --> 00:27:58.902\nYou do have that option though where\nyou can just do the written space.\n\n567\n00:27:58.902 --> 00:28:01.317\nWe normally could just go and\ndo the whole thing and\n\n568\n00:28:01.317 --> 00:28:04.662\nthat's what it was doing when I was\nwiping this partition here, so.\n\n569\n00:28:04.662 --> 00:28:06.125\nA couple of different\noptions are out there.\n\n570\n00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:08.950\n>> Well Don, it looks like we're\ncoming to the end of another episode.\n\n571\n00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:11.365\nWe're definitely a little\nshort on time on this one.\n\n572\n00:28:11.365 --> 00:28:13.570\nGot any last words for\nus here on this one?\n\n573\n00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.263\n>> Remember that destruction\nis always an option.\n\n574\n00:28:16.263 --> 00:28:17.007\nYou can always destroy the drive.\n\n575\n00:28:17.007 --> 00:28:18.086\nThat one, you can always trust.\n\n576\n00:28:18.086 --> 00:28:22.005\nBut on the exam, just remember\nthat you do have a two, three, and\n\n577\n00:28:22.005 --> 00:28:24.948\nseven pass option to\nsecurely erase your drive.\n\n578\n00:28:24.948 --> 00:28:29.788\nAnd then back on FileVault, don't lose\nyour recovery key, it's important.\n\n579\n00:28:29.788 --> 00:28:33.570\nIt's gonna save your bacon, if you ever\nlose your password and it's important.\n\n580\n00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.428\nBut if somebody else gets a hold of it,\nit's a giant risk too.\n\n581\n00:28:36.428 --> 00:28:38.910\nSo you need to make sure that\nit's stored somewhere safe.\n\n582\n00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.440\n>> Well, thank you for\nthat information, Don, and\n\n583\n00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.160\nthank you to our viewers out there for\nwatching.\n\n584\n00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.700\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here at IT Pro TV.\n\n585\n00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.380\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n586\n00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.100\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n587\n00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.054\n>> And

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:18.035\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n5\n00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:18.936\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:23.020\nwe're continuing on with our Apple\nCertified Support Professionals series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's a mouthful.\n\n8\n00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.140\n[LAUGH] Joining us in the studio here\ntoday is none other than our good friend,\n\n9\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.825\nMr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:30.345\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:31.355\n>> Thanks for having me back, Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:34.455\nI'm ready to jump right back into\nthe support professional world.\n\n13\n00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:38.640\nBasically, in this episode we're gonna be\ntackling a pretty important concept that I\n\n14\n00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.800\nwill tell you that the majority of\nengineers completely ignore and\n\n15\n00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.230\nthat's file permissions.\n\n16\n00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.552\nWe've hit on this a little bit like when\nwe shared some folders out on the network\n\n17\n00:00:46.552 --> 00:00:48.199\nwe saw a little bit about permissions.\n\n18\n00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.394\nBut now we're gonna do a really good\ndeep dive into them and see how we\n\n19\n00:00:51.394 --> 00:00:55.209\ncan secure files on our systems, how we\ncan make them available to other people,\n\n20\n00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:57.648\nother users on our system or\neven over the network.\n\n21\n00:00:57.648 --> 00:01:01.314\nAnd we're even going to jump that\ndivide where we go from looking at\n\n22\n00:01:01.314 --> 00:01:05.763\nthe Mac OS permissions to looking at the\nUnix level permissions under the hood and\n\n23\n00:01:05.763 --> 00:01:07.610\nsee how those affect our system.\n\n24\n00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.679\nSo, there's a lot of really cool stuff,\nand\n\n25\n00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.468\nit's a lot things that most of\nyou engineers just never see.\n\n26\n00:01:12.468 --> 00:01:15.152\nI'm kind of excited cuz it's always\nfun to see this stuff that's usually\n\n27\n00:01:15.152 --> 00:01:16.740\nbehind the scenes.\n\n28\n00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.760\n>> Do a little bit of a deep\ndive today then, Don?\n\n29\n00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.472\n>> Absolutely and this is another one of\nthose, Daniel, where I set out to make\n\n30\n00:01:22.472 --> 00:01:26.601\na single 30 minute episode for us and this\none's going to be more than one episode.\n\n31\n00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:29.375\nSo plan on there being a part two,\nmaybe a part three.\n\n32\n00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:32.515\nThis might be a file permissions trilogy,\nwe'll see how it goes.\n\n33\n00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:34.815\n>> We've got a pool going on around\nthe office of how many episodes\n\n34\n00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:35.700\nthis is gonna be.\n\n35\n00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.265\n[LAUGH]\n>> We should follow the Star Wars\n\n36\n00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:38.835\nmentality, right?\n\n37\n00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:41.145\nWhere the first episode we've\ngot to create some kind of\n\n38\n00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:42.085\nchallenge why we're coming.\n\n39\n00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:42.880\n>> Right, that's right.\n\n40\n00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.740\n>> And the second one would\nbe at rock bottom right?\n\n41\n00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.535\nSo definitely look forward for that.\n\n42\n00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:50.110\nLet's kick this thing off,\nenough of me jibber-jabbering on about it.\n\n43\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.360\nFirst off what are permissions, right?\n\n44\n00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.550\nWhen you create a file in Mac OS and\nany file, any folder for that matter.\n\n45\n00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.280\nWhen you create that file system item,\na set of permissions are applied to it.\n\n46\n00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.360\nA set of default permissions\nare applied to it.\n\n47\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.930\nAnd various things happen with those\npermissions as you work with the file or\n\n48\n00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.270\nwith the folder.\n\n49\n00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.230\nBut ultimately what those permissions do\nis they dictate who's allowed to touch\n\n50\n00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.890\nthe file or folder.\n\n51\n00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.090\nAnd when they touch it what\nare they allowed to do with it?\n\n52\n00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.410\nAre they allowed to read it?\n\n53\n00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.040\nAre they allowed to write to it or\nchange it?\n\n54\n00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.770\nAre they allowed to delete it?\n\n55\n00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.530\nWhat can they do?\n\n56\n00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.770\nWhat permissions do they have?\n\n57\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.090\nNow if you have a laptop for example and\n\n58\n00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.340\nyou're the only user that uses\nthat laptop, you don't think much\n\n59\n00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.220\nabout permissions you just create the\nfiles you work with them and that's it.\n\n60\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.330\nAnd that's why I say most end users\nnever even look at this stuff.\n\n61\n00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.610\nBut if you've got a shared computer,\nmaybe it's a family computer,\n\n62\n00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.810\nand you and your spouse, your children,\nthey all use the computer.\n\n63\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.010\nNow when one person creates\na file the other people may or\n\n64\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.020\nmay not have access to it.\n\n65\n00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.360\nOr in an enterprise environment, you might\nhave a file server setup that's a MAC.\n\n66\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.860\nAnd you're sharing folders\nout across the network so\n\n67\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.010\nthat your end users can access them.\n\n68\n00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.670\nWhat access do they get?\n\n69\n00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.640\nI might have some documents that I only\nwant one person to have access to.\n\n70\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.200\nI'm gonna have other documents I want\nan entire department to have access to.\n\n71\n00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.850\nAnd I may have yet\n\n72\n00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.440\nanother set of documents I want everybody\nto have access to, so for example let's\n\n73\n00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.700\nsay there's an employee handbook, right,\nmost companies have an employee handbook.\n\n74\n00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.130\nSo I want to store that on\na file server somewhere and\n\n75\n00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.450\nmake sure that my employees can get to it,\nright.\n\n76\n00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.080\nBut I don't want just anybody\nto be able to edit it.\n\n77\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.220\nIf the employee handbook says every\nemployee gets two weeks of vacation,\n\n78\n00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.510\nI don't want Bob in accounting to say,\nwell, let me just edit that and\n\n79\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.130\nnow I get three weeks of vacation.\n\n80\n00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.840\nThank you sir.\n\n81\n00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.488\n>> Except Bob.\n\n82\n00:03:32.488 --> 00:03:34.390\n[LAUGH]\n>> Except Bob.\n\n83\n00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.070\nSo, if somebody could edit that,\nthat would be bad, but\n\n84\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.340\nI want them to have access.\n\n85\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.020\nSo I can create a fileshare that says\nthe whole company gets read only.\n\n86\n00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.070\nThey can read it, but\nthey can't change it or delete it.\n\n87\n00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.570\nBut, then the Human Resources department,\nI want to allow them to modify the file.\n\n88\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.500\nI want them to be able to change it,\nbecause they're Human Resources.\n\n89\n00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500\nThey're the ones who\ndictate those policies.\n\n90\n00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.320\nSo, we can set that up, and\nit's all file permissions that do that.\n\n91\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.480\nNow, if you've never looked at file\npermissions in a file or folder,\n\n92\n00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.310\nlet me just show you here.\n\n93\n00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.040\nI'll pull one up on my system.\n\n94\n00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.220\nI'm just going to take my desktop here,\nand let's fire up ol' Text Edit.\n\n95\n00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.240\nI'm going to create a document.\n\n96\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.010\nThis is a document, and\nI'll save it to my desktop.\n\n97\n00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.070\nSo this is my very special document.\n\n98\n00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.170\nAnd, oops, I said I was gonna\nsave it to the desktop and\n\n99\n00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.600\nthen I put it somewhere else.\n\n100\n00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.390\nLet me go find that file that I just made.\n\n101\n00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.250\nAnd now it's on my desktop.\n\n102\n00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.300\nOkay, so\nhere's that document that I just made.\n\n103\n00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.580\nAnd [COUGH] if you do a Cmd+I,\nyou can do the Get Info screen or\n\n104\n00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.240\nif you, I'll option click and\ndo a, let's see, Get Info.\n\n105\n00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.150\nWe can pull that up and we can start\nto take a look at the permissions.\n\n106\n00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.000\nNow for this one, it's a text file.\n\n107\n00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.810\nAnd so I get my preview.\n\n108\n00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.100\nThe preview's eating up a lot of space.\n\n109\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.320\nSo let me get rid of that.\n\n110\n00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.930\nAnd here's my Sharing and\nShare Permissions right beneath it.\n\n111\n00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.620\nAnd what you're going to\nsee are three things.\n\n112\n00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.040\nThe permissions that are applied\nto the file by default\n\n113\n00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.170\nconform to the standard\nUnix type permissions.\n\n114\n00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.770\nActually two different types of\npermissions in Mac OS, there's the Unix\n\n115\n00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.640\nstyle And then there's the Mac OS style\npermissions, and they blend together.\n\n116\n00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.770\nWe actually don't know the difference from\nthe GUI they just all look the same, but\n\n117\n00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.990\nthese are actually\nstandard Unix permissions.\n\n118\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.770\nAnd in standard Unix permissions,\nyou have the owner of the item,\n\n119\n00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.220\nwhich is whoever created it.\n\n120\n00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.800\nYou'll hear this called the creator,\nor the owner, or the user.\n\n121\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.910\nThere's different terminology you'll see\ndepending on where you are, but in Mac OS,\n\n122\n00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.130\nwe normally call this the creator.\n\n123\n00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.680\nThis is the person who created that file,\nthey own that file.\n\n124\n00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.090\nThen you see the group.\n\n125\n00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.680\nWhat group is attached to that file?\n\n126\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.730\nNot just one person, but a collection\nof people and lastly, you see everyone.\n\n127\n00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.220\nThis is sometimes called other, right?\n\n128\n00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.310\nSo if you're not the creator and you're\nnot in the group that is attached to it\n\n129\n00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.630\nthen you fall in into this last one,\nthe other group.\n\n130\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.850\nAnd that’s what everybody else has.\n\n131\n00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.650\nAnd so\nI can dictate permissions right here.\n\n132\n00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.520\nI can say, hey, I’m the owner, right?\n\n133\n00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.220\nSo dpezet, I created this, I'm the owner.\n\n134\n00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.220\nAnd I get read and write.\n\n135\n00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.910\nI can do whatever I want to that file.\n\n136\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.480\nStaff, who is staff?\n\n137\n00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.400\nWell on a default Mac OS X install,\nwhen you fire up OS X the first time, and\n\n138\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.510\nyou get in there and start creating files,\nthere's really two groups that you'll see.\n\n139\n00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.240\nI mean,\nthere's a few others that you might see.\n\n140\n00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.530\nThere's actually a good 10 or\n15 of them by default.\n\n141\n00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.480\nBut there's really two that you'll see.\n\n142\n00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.220\nOne is Administrators,\nand one is Staff, right?\n\n143\n00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.810\nAnd Administrators is actually\nwritten Admin, so Admin and Staff.\n\n144\n00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.060\nAdmin, well, those are the Administrators.\n\n145\n00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.010\nThat's the people who have user accounts\nin your system that are flagged as\n\n146\n00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.520\nAdministrators.\n\n147\n00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.860\nSo when I go into System Preferences, and\n\n148\n00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.060\nI dive down into Users and Groups, see\nhow my user account shows up as an admin?\n\n149\n00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.810\nBut if I create an account for\nDaniel, for example, so\n\n150\n00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.650\nI'm gonna jump in here and\nadd him an account.\n\n151\n00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.070\n>> I noticed that it took\nadministrative privileges to do so.\n\n152\n00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.088\n>> Yeah, you gotta be an admin\nto create an account.\n\n153\n00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.490\nAnd so\nI'm gonna create an account for you.\n\n154\n00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.210\nAnd I'll assign you a password.\n\n155\n00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.900\nSo now he is just a regular old user.\n\n156\n00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.480\nYou see how it says Standard?\n\n157\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.280\nWell, if you watched our earlier episodes\nyou know there's a couple of different\n\n158\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.460\nthings that could show up here.\n\n159\n00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.280\nIt could say Standard, it could say Admin,\n\n160\n00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.200\nit could say Managed if you had\nparental controls turned on.\n\n161\n00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.190\nBut at the end of the day,\nhe's just another user.\n\n162\n00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.690\nAnd he's not an admin, so\nhe wouldn't fall under the admin group.\n\n163\n00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.860\nHe would fall under staff.\n\n164\n00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.720\nThe staff group is every user that\nhas an account on your system.\n\n165\n00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.030\nSo I'm in staff, even though I'm an admin.\n\n166\n00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.690\nI'm an admin and staff.\n\n167\n00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.490\nBut Daniel is just in staff\nbecause he's not an administrator.\n\n168\n00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.310\nSo those are the two\nmain groups that we see.\n\n169\n00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.939\nNow under the hood, if you dig down\ninto the base OS you'll find there's\n\n170\n00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:50.885\nlike a wheel group and a bunch of other\nones that are out there that might pop up.\n\n171\n00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:53.845\nBut in the UI we normally\njust see admin and staff, or\n\n172\n00:07:53.845 --> 00:07:56.144\nany custom group that you may have made.\n\n173\n00:07:56.144 --> 00:07:58.477\nYou can make your own groups\nbased on your needs, and\n\n174\n00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:01.462\nif you're connected to an open directory,\nyou likely have that.\n\n175\n00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:05.640\nYou probably have an accounting\ndepartment, a human resources, sales,\n\n176\n00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.600\nwhatever.\n\n177\n00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.230\nEach of the different departments,\nyou probably have groups for those, and\n\n178\n00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.130\nthey may show up here too.\n\n179\n00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.000\nThose are the groups that are attached to\nthis file and what permissions they have.\n\n180\n00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.450\nAnd then that last one, everyone,\nthis is everybody else.\n\n181\n00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.680\nIf I want myself to have access and\nthen I want\n\n182\n00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.500\nall the staff on the computer to be able\nto read but not change it, that's fine.\n\n183\n00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.270\nBut I may not want\neveryone to have access.\n\n184\n00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.670\nAnd so we can tweak those permissions\nright here and change what they are.\n\n185\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.850\nSo under the owner, well,\nI'm the person who made it.\n\n186\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.320\nI'm the person who has access, and\nso I can really do whatever I want.\n\n187\n00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.770\nAnd so Read & Write is\nthe permission that we want.\n\n188\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.270\nRead only is the other option.\n\n189\n00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.970\nRead only means I can see the file, I can\nopen the file, but if I make any changes,\n\n190\n00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.150\nit won't let me save.\n\n191\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.020\nAnd I can't delete the file,\nit's read only,\n\n192\n00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.480\nI can't make modifications to that file.\n\n193\n00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.540\nIf we take a look at staff, well,\nyou'll see much the same thing,\n\n194\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.920\nRead & Write and Read only.\n\n195\n00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.250\nIf I take a look at everyone,\nI get one more option,\n\n196\n00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.860\nthis guy right here, No Access.\n\n197\n00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.770\nSo they can get Read & Write,\nthey can get Read only or No Access.\n\n198\n00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.010\nNo Access only shows up\non the everyone group.\n\n199\n00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.460\nAnd this is where I can say, I don't want\neverybody to have access to the file.\n\n200\n00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.440\nI just want the user and\ngroup up here and that's it.\n\n201\n00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.540\nI just want those people to have\nthat access, and that's it.\n\n202\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.400\nYou can be very specific.\n\n203\n00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.430\nSo it's neat that we can jump in here and\nwe can change this,\n\n204\n00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.200\nwe can modify these, and\nyou can add and remove people to it.\n\n205\n00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.980\nBut these three,\n\n206\n00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.220\nthese defaults, represent the standard\nUNIX permissions found on a file.\n\n207\n00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.530\nSo we have not deviated from any\nUNIX standard at this point.\n\n208\n00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.570\nWhere things get different\nis when we add more to it.\n\n209\n00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.311\nSo in the UNIX world, that's all\nwe've got, those three things right?\n\n210\n00:09:46.311 --> 00:09:49.263\nThe owner, the group, and other, right?\n\n211\n00:09:49.263 --> 00:09:52.945\nAnd owner's usually just called the user,\nso that they're different.\n\n212\n00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:55.725\nUser starts with a U, other starts\nwith an O, they don't want to overlap.\n\n213\n00:09:55.725 --> 00:10:01.420\nSo the user, the group, and the other, but\non a map we can do a heck of a lot more.\n\n214\n00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.444\nSo for example, let me show you.\n\n215\n00:10:03.444 --> 00:10:06.530\nIf I jump back here to my user accounts,\n\n216\n00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.750\nI'm gonna create a group\nthat I will call Marketing.\n\n217\n00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.330\nSo this is my Marketing group.\n\n218\n00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:19.583\nI'll create another group,\nwhich I will call Human Resources.\n\n219\n00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:23.022\nAll right, oops.\n\n220\n00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:27.050\nI'm creating an account, I wanna\ncreate a group called Human Resources.\n\n221\n00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:33.750\nAnd maybe I'll create another group\nthat I'll call All Employees.\n\n222\n00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.280\nAll Employees.\n\n223\n00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.620\nSo this'll be the whole company.\n\n224\n00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.010\nEverybody's gonna be in this one.\n\n225\n00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.900\nAnd neat thing about groups, I don't know\nif I talked about this back in the groups\n\n226\n00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.720\nepisode, but you can nest groups.\n\n227\n00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.340\nSo in All Employees,\nI might want Marketing and\n\n228\n00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.770\nHuman Resources to be in\nthe All Employees group.\n\n229\n00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.840\nSo when I give permission\nto the All Employees group,\n\n230\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.250\nit's gonna be everybody in Marketing and\nHuman Resources.\n\n231\n00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.559\nVersus Human Resources, where maybe\nI'm a part of that one and Marketing,\n\n232\n00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:02.448\nDaniel'll be a part of that one.\n\n233\n00:11:02.448 --> 00:11:06.220\nSo, Daniel's in the Marketing group,\nMarketing is in the All Employees group.\n\n234\n00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.503\nSo Daniel is transitively,\nI'm gonna use my big words today.\n\n235\n00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:13.592\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Transitively A equals B and B equals C,\n\n236\n00:11:13.592 --> 00:11:16.750\nthen A equals C, whatever that is.\n\n237\n00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.680\nI know geometry from 20 years ago.\n\n238\n00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.021\nBut because Daniel's in Marketing,\nMarketing is in All Employees,\n\n239\n00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:24.250\nDaniel is now effectively\nin All Employees.\n\n240\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.950\nYou don't see that here but\nyou see the group membership.\n\n241\n00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.100\nSo I've got these groups created now.\n\n242\n00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.031\nAnd so when I create this file and\nI go to set its permissions,\n\n243\n00:11:34.031 --> 00:11:37.513\nmaybe I want Marketing\nto have Read only and\n\n244\n00:11:37.513 --> 00:11:41.207\nI want Human Resources\nto have Read & Write.\n\n245\n00:11:41.207 --> 00:11:48.242\nAnd I want everybody to have Read only and\nHuman resources to have Read & Write.\n\n246\n00:11:48.242 --> 00:11:51.172\nWell, let's go with that model first,\nI want everybody to be able to read it.\n\n247\n00:11:51.172 --> 00:11:53.526\nWell, that's kind of a default,\neveryone can read.\n\n248\n00:11:53.526 --> 00:11:56.004\nBut I want Human Resources\nto be able to modify it.\n\n249\n00:11:56.004 --> 00:11:58.816\nWell, I've got staff right now.\n\n250\n00:11:58.816 --> 00:12:00.101\nAnd if I choose staff,\n\n251\n00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:03.930\nthere's not a whole heck of a lot\nI can do here with it, right?\n\n252\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:08.430\nBecause when the file was created, staff\nwas assigned to it, that was the default.\n\n253\n00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.900\nI wanna modify it.\n\n254\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.450\nAnd as long as I stay within\nthe limits of one user,\n\n255\n00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.670\none group and one other,\nthen I kind of conform to the Unix world.\n\n256\n00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:23.570\nBut if I start to deviate and I move into\nsomething different where I leave staff,\n\n257\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:29.430\ncuz I'm okay with everybody having Read\nonly, but then I add in Human Resources or\n\n258\n00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.760\nMarketing or whatever and I start getting\nspecific about their permissions.\n\n259\n00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.120\nSo I'm gonna add in these other groups.\n\n260\n00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.370\nNow, what you'll see is I've got more.\n\n261\n00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.982\nI've got the user, the group, the other,\nand then I've got two more groups.\n\n262\n00:12:43.982 --> 00:12:44.931\n>> You've got the other, other.\n\n263\n00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:45.690\n>> Yeah.\n\n264\n00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.480\nI've got three groups.\n\n265\n00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.030\nAnd in the UNIX world, you can't do that.\n\n266\n00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:54.000\nSo now I've moved beyond standard\nUNIX file permissions and\n\n267\n00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.050\nI've got what's called\nan access control list.\n\n268\n00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.620\nAn access control list is an ACL, and\n\n269\n00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.940\nthe ACL is just a list of entries and who\nhas what access, and an ACL has no limit.\n\n270\n00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.690\nIt's not limited to just these three,\nyou can have more.\n\n271\n00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.210\nNow, why it's still saying\nFetching is beyond me.\n\n272\n00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.640\nWhat it's trying to do is\nfetch the actual name.\n\n273\n00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.870\nRemember that when you have a group or\na user,\n\n274\n00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.560\non the back end there's actually this\nUUID that identifies that group or user.\n\n275\n00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.260\nSo when I added it,\nthat's what I added, and\n\n276\n00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.600\nnow it's trying to get the name\nto show it here on the screen.\n\n277\n00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.410\nI'm not sure why it's taking so\nlong, but it'll turn up.\n\n278\n00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.258\nBut now I can go through and\nI can set the permissions.\n\n279\n00:13:25.258 --> 00:13:27.198\nMy problem is if I can't see the name,\n\n280\n00:13:27.198 --> 00:13:30.913\nI don't know which one I wanna make\nhave write permissions or whatever.\n\n281\n00:13:30.913 --> 00:13:32.525\n>> I like to keep things mysterious, Don.\n\n282\n00:13:32.525 --> 00:13:34.494\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just roll the dice, man.\n\n283\n00:13:34.494 --> 00:13:38.690\n>> [LAUGH] Normally I would blame this on,\nif I had an Open Directory server or\n\n284\n00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.330\nif I had an Active Directory server,\nthat, hey, maybe the network is slow and\n\n285\n00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.670\nI'm not reaching out to the host.\n\n286\n00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:44.930\nBut these are a local group.\n\n287\n00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.030\nSo if this ever happens to you,\nlet me tell you,\n\n288\n00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:51.640\nwhen you're working with permissions OSX\nis not the best at refreshing its screen.\n\n289\n00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.060\nSo a lot of times if we just close this,\nlet's give it a shot here.\n\n290\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.887\nSo I'm just gonna take this,\nand I'll close it.\n\n291\n00:13:56.887 --> 00:14:01.301\nAnd once I close it, there we go, I can\njust pull the information back up and\n\n292\n00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:03.630\na lot of times that will take care of it.\n\n293\n00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.940\nAnd you know, actually,\nI see that it has not fixed it yet.\n\n294\n00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.020\nSo, all right, well, my system's just\nrunning a bit slow today I guess,\n\n295\n00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:09.830\nwe'll have to give it a minute.\n\n296\n00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.600\nBut while we're waiting on it, I'll go\nahead and just assign one of them and\n\n297\n00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.600\nhope I get it right.\n\n298\n00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.411\nI'll assign the first one Read & Write and\nI'll leave the only one Read only.\n\n299\n00:14:16.411 --> 00:14:18.761\nAssuming that the first one is\nthe Human Resources department.\n\n300\n00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:19.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That, you know what?\n\n301\n00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.600\nI know a way we can guarantee this,\nlet me just pull them both out.\n\n302\n00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.610\nAnd I'll add them one at a time and\nthen I won't have to worry about it.\n\n303\n00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.340\n[LAUGH] So now if I come in here, and\nI'm gonna add in Human Resources.\n\n304\n00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.357\nThat's who I wanted to have Read & Write.\n\n305\n00:14:30.357 --> 00:14:32.343\nSo I'm gonna give them Read & Write.\n\n306\n00:14:32.343 --> 00:14:34.537\nAnd now I can come in and\nI can add Marketing or\n\n307\n00:14:34.537 --> 00:14:37.280\nAll Employees would probably\nbe the better one to add.\n\n308\n00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.437\nAnd I can add them in and leave them\nat Read only which is that default.\n\n309\n00:14:42.437 --> 00:14:46.973\nSo now I'll have Read & Write,\nHuman Resources will have a Read & Write,\n\n310\n00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:50.289\neverybody else is gonna have Read only and\nthat's it.\n\n311\n00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:54.759\nNow one word of caution,\nI added the All Employees group and\n\n312\n00:14:54.759 --> 00:14:59.061\nAll Employees contains Marketing and\nHuman Resources.\n\n313\n00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:03.515\nBut I've got everyone, so do I need\nall employees when I've got everyone?\n\n314\n00:15:03.515 --> 00:15:07.780\nWell, everyone also includes guest.\n\n315\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.150\nThe guest account,\nsomebody who hasn't even logged in.\n\n316\n00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.020\nSo I might not want that.\n\n317\n00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.060\nI might want to change\neveryone to No Access.\n\n318\n00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.560\nNow, I added All Employees up here,\nthat's this one that's still fetching, for\n\n319\n00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.830\nwhatever reason.\n\n320\n00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.380\nSo I've added that one.\n\n321\n00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.100\nAnd, it's going to support that, right.\n\n322\n00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:30.150\nIt's going to support all the employees in\nmy company cuz those groups are in it, but\n\n323\n00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.680\nit's not going to include guest.\n\n324\n00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.070\nSo I don't want anonymous access.\n\n325\n00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.953\nSo you do have to at least log in\nto be able to get to my employee\n\n326\n00:15:35.953 --> 00:15:37.545\nhandbook, right.\n\n327\n00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:39.440\nAnd I wonder if it's\ncuz I have it unlocked.\n\n328\n00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.120\nLet me unlock this thing.\n\n329\n00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.971\nThat may be what my problem is.\n\n330\n00:15:42.971 --> 00:15:44.926\nLet's see if that makes a difference for\nus.\n\n331\n00:15:44.926 --> 00:15:45.804\nNo.\n\n332\n00:15:45.804 --> 00:15:46.894\nAll right, so.\n[LAUGH]\n\n333\n00:15:46.894 --> 00:15:47.394\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n334\n00:15:47.394 --> 00:15:47.913\n>> So, anyhow.\n\n335\n00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:49.454\nEventually it'll fix that name in display\n\n336\n00:15:49.454 --> 00:15:51.848\nthere, but the permissions are set\nright because on the back end,\n\n337\n00:15:51.848 --> 00:15:54.573\nyou have that UUID that's being attached\nand there is a way to verify this.\n\n338\n00:15:54.573 --> 00:15:56.171\nI'll show you guys here in just a minute.\n\n339\n00:15:56.171 --> 00:15:59.189\nWe can drop to the terminal.\n\n340\n00:15:59.189 --> 00:16:00.924\nAnd from our bash prompt, we can go in and\n\n341\n00:16:00.924 --> 00:16:04.392\nwe can verify these permissions, right?\nLet's do this since I can't seem to count\n\n342\n00:16:04.392 --> 00:16:05.990\non my UI here.\nI'm gonna close this window out.\n\n343\n00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:11.940\n>> Yeah, this is a great example\nof when I first UNIX type systems.\n\n344\n00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.120\nWe had a guy who was like why\nare we learning all this terminal\n\n345\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.620\ncommand line stuff?\n\n346\n00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.680\nI say every now and\nthen the GUI doesn't work and\n\n347\n00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.730\nyou are only left with a terminal and\nthis is a prime example of that.\n\n348\n00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.610\nYou do need to learn your\ncommand line prompts cuz\n\n349\n00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:25.810\nthey're gonna help you out a lot.\n\n350\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.270\n>> Yeah there are times and actually\nI'll show you guys here in a minute,\n\n351\n00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.340\nthere are some things you can\nonly see from the terminal so\n\n352\n00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.270\nit's pretty handy to have that.\n\n353\n00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.941\nAll right so here I am on my desktop.\n\n354\n00:16:33.941 --> 00:16:37.238\nAnd if i just pull up a listing\nI can see a Document.rtf, right?\n\n355\n00:16:37.238 --> 00:16:44.866\nThat's the document that i made sitting on\nmy desktop and if i'll do an ls -l, right?\n\n356\n00:16:44.866 --> 00:16:48.385\nThat this give me the long\nlisting of the files, right?\n\n357\n00:16:48.385 --> 00:16:53.213\nI'm giving the short listing there where\njust give me the file name, but the long\n\n358\n00:16:53.213 --> 00:16:57.757\nlisting will give the file name as well\nas the date it was created, the size of\n\n359\n00:16:57.757 --> 00:17:02.684\nthe file, the user and the group it's\nattached to, and the permissions, okay?\n\n360\n00:17:02.684 --> 00:17:04.284\nAnd when I look at this,\n\n361\n00:17:04.284 --> 00:17:08.370\nit's giving me an idea of what\nis currently set on this file.\n\n362\n00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.190\nSo let's break down what's\nit's giving me here.\n\n363\n00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.740\nLet's break it down.\n\n364\n00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.130\nWe'll do it MC Hammer style.\n\n365\n00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:17.150\nSo as we look at this, the very first\npart here these are my permissions, okay.\n\n366\n00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.850\nSo these are the permissions\nattached to the file.\n\n367\n00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:26.180\nAfter that I see who the user is, who's\nthe person that actually created this?\n\n368\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.580\nSo it's dpezet, then the group, who's\nthe group that's attached to manage this?\n\n369\n00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.190\nAnd right now it's staff.\n\n370\n00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:35.170\nThen the size and the size is in bytes.\n\n371\n00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.070\nSo this is 339 bytes.\n\n372\n00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.480\nNow the bigger the file,\n\n373\n00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.030\nthe bigger this number gets and\nit gets to be a little weird.\n\n374\n00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:44.920\nAnd so when I do ls -l,\nI normally add an h to it.\n\n375\n00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.750\nAnd h says make the size human readable.\n\n376\n00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.271\nAnd on a small file like this, see how\nit didn't make that much difference,\n\n377\n00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:55.090\nit just added a b to the end of it\nto let me know that it is bytes.\n\n378\n00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.054\nWhere that really makes a difference is,\nfor example let me get into\n\n379\n00:17:58.054 --> 00:18:01.235\nthe applications folders where we've\ngot some nice big files, right?\n\n380\n00:18:01.235 --> 00:18:05.033\nSo if I do an ls -l here, and\nyou start looking at these files and\n\n381\n00:18:05.033 --> 00:18:07.340\nlooking at their sizes, shoot.\n\n382\n00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.250\nThese are folders,\nthat's not going to work for me, is it?\n\n383\n00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.020\nWhat would be a better folder for\nme to get to.\n\n384\n00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.310\nI could go inside of an app, I guess.\n\n385\n00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.070\n>> Yeah, apps, riht?\n\n386\n00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.600\nThe app folder.\n\n387\n00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.530\nNot a lot of executables.\n\n388\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:21.670\n>> Let's see, iBooks.app.\n\n389\n00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:22.670\nThere we go.\n\n390\n00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:23.980\nYeah let's just browse into one of these.\n\n391\n00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.870\nI'll find a, [LAUGH] if I can spell right.\n\n392\n00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:32.080\nI'll get into a folder that actually\nhas some stuff in it that we can see.\n\n393\n00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.420\nAnd basically being able to\nchange that file size output.\n\n394\n00:18:36.665 --> 00:18:37.485\nThere we go.\n\n395\n00:18:37.485 --> 00:18:40.615\nSo looking up here,\nI've got some icon files and stuff.\n\n396\n00:18:40.615 --> 00:18:41.725\nAnd they're pretty big, right?\n\n397\n00:18:41.725 --> 00:18:46.785\nWell, those are in bytes, so it's\nactually 767 kilobytes or 500 kilobytes.\n\n398\n00:18:46.785 --> 00:18:50.075\nAnd so when we, that was fun.\n\n399\n00:18:50.075 --> 00:18:54.400\nWhen we do ls -lh, now it's gonna\nmake them human-readable and\n\n400\n00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.120\nsee how it may those 750K, 489K.\n\n401\n00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.755\nThat's a little bit handy to be able to\nsee that in a form that is more readable.\n\n402\n00:19:01.755 --> 00:19:03.360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And when you get megabytes and\n\n403\n00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.600\ngigabytes and so on and\nit's gonna realign to show that.\n\n404\n00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.901\nSo kind of a cool way to get around that.\n\n405\n00:19:08.901 --> 00:19:12.200\nAll right so getting back to my desktop,\n\n406\n00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.310\nI keep wanting to do the dash A option,\njust because it's so ingrained.\n\n407\n00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.900\nI always do it.\n\n408\n00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.690\nDash A means show me all the files.\n\n409\n00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:21.710\nThere's sometimes hidden\nfiles that you don't see.\n\n410\n00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:28.460\nSo, when I do ls -lh Im seeing just\nDocument.rtf, but if I do ls -lah,\n\n411\n00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:34.630\nwhich is almost always what I run then\nsee how there's a .localized file?\n\n412\n00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.640\nThere was a hidden file, and it was\nhidden because it starts with a dot,\n\n413\n00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.570\nany filename that starts\nwith a dot you don't see.\n\n414\n00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.010\nSo it's just hidden, no special\npermission, it's just hidden from view.\n\n415\n00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.280\nSo I usually do the lah so\nthat I can see the long listing,\n\n416\n00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.948\nall the files including hidden ones,\nand make it human readable, lah.\n\n417\n00:19:50.948 --> 00:19:56.840\nAll right, so I see the user,\nI see the group, I see the size, then\n\n418\n00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.720\nthe date that it was created so March 28\nat 10:08 AM, there it is, very exciting.\n\n419\n00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.740\nFollowed by the file name Document.rtf,\nright?\n\n420\n00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.560\nThat's what all makes up that line.\n\n421\n00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.840\nBut the most confusing part is\nthis guy right here, right?\n\n422\n00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.230\nSo what does this boil down to.\n\n423\n00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.260\nWell these permissions actually\nboil down a lot easier.\n\n424\n00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.020\nThey look really complex,\nit's actually not bad at all.\n\n425\n00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.340\nThe first letter is either a d or\n\n426\n00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.930\na -, d means it's a directory,-\nmeans it's a file, right?\n\n427\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:30.724\nSo I made a file called document,\nDocument.rtf.\n\n428\n00:20:30.724 --> 00:20:34.720\nIf I had made a folder, and\nmaybe I call it a folder,\n\n429\n00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.680\nwell I'm not gonna give it the same name,\nI'll just call it Don's folder.\n\n430\n00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.490\nSo I just made a folder right there,\nand now when I come back here and\n\n431\n00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:48.890\nI do an ls -lah and\nI take a look at what I got, I've got my\n\n432\n00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:54.660\ndocument right here and then here's Don's\nFolder, right so Don's Folder right there.\n\n433\n00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.710\nAnd I can see that it does start with\nthe letter d so I know that it's a folder.\n\n434\n00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.030\nSo that's how the file system keeps track\nof whether you're dealing with a file or\n\n435\n00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.850\nfolder with that first letter.\n\n436\n00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:07.310\nThe next nine letters\nare your permissions, okay?\n\n437\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.590\nAnd what you have are three letters for\neach permission.\n\n438\n00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.920\nThe user, the group, and the other.\n\n439\n00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.800\nSo the user, rwx.\n\n440\n00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.960\nThe group, rwx.\n\n441\n00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.220\nAnd then other, rwx.\n\n442\n00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:26.600\nR is read, can you read the file,\ncan you open it and look inside it?\n\n443\n00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.500\nW is right,\ncan you change the file and modify it?\n\n444\n00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.450\nAnd then x is execute,\nif it's a program, can you run it?\n\n445\n00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:38.710\nOr if it's a script,\ncan you run it, right, rwx.\n\n446\n00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:43.710\nWell remember in the GUI when I\ncreated the Document.rtf file\n\n447\n00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.900\nI gave myself read and write.\n\n448\n00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:52.610\nI gave the group read only, and\nthen I gave everyone else no access.\n\n449\n00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.920\nAnd so when I look at Document.rtf,\nI can see that I,\n\n450\n00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:02.550\nthe owner, the user,\nI have read write and a dash.\n\n451\n00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.990\nI can read it, I can write to it,\nbut I can't execute it.\n\n452\n00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.020\nAnd that's okay, cuz this is a document\nit's not a program, it's not a script,\n\n453\n00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.680\nit's just a document,\nI don't need execute permissions on that.\n\n454\n00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:15.395\n>> So is a hyphen for a place holder for\nany permissions that you don't have?\n\n455\n00:22:15.395 --> 00:22:16.540\n>> Right, it means that you are not.\n\n456\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.890\nSo the very first one here.\n\n457\n00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:22.090\nI am not a directory and\nthen I do not have the execute bit.\n\n458\n00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.900\nI cannot run this file, but\nit's not a program anyway.\n\n459\n00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.785\nWhat do I care.\n\n460\n00:22:25.785 --> 00:22:26.310\nright?\n\n461\n00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.150\nAnd then, we get the group.\n\n462\n00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.420\nNow, the group was staff.\n\n463\n00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.390\nI said the staff group,\ncuz we can see that right here.\n\n464\n00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.030\nThat the staff group would\njust have read access.\n\n465\n00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.070\nThey wouldn't be able to write to it.\n\n466\n00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:39.450\nAnd, so I see, they've got read, they\ndon't have write, they don't have execute.\n\n467\n00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.200\nAnd then the other.\n\n468\n00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.900\nOther is everyone else.\n\n469\n00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.200\nEveryone else is going to have what?\n\n470\n00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.050\nNo access.\n\n471\n00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.140\nAnd so dash dash dash.\n\n472\n00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.030\nThey don't have read.\n\n473\n00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:49.710\nThey don't have write.\n\n474\n00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.430\nThey don't have execute.\n\n475\n00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:52.370\nThey don't get any of that, right?\n\n476\n00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:55.220\nThose were the standard Unix\npermissions that I set.\n\n477\n00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.670\n>> So Don, interesting enough,\nI'm looking at your screen there and\n\n478\n00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.100\nwe see the staff group but\nI know you created.\n\n479\n00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.630\nI know it says fetching there in our\nnice little graphical interface, but\n\n480\n00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.400\nI know you added a couple other groups and\n\n481\n00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.690\nwe're not seeing them here in our Linux or\nUnix permissions.\n\n482\n00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:10.870\n>> Shoot, I closed my terminal.\n\n483\n00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:11.910\nLet me get back up.\n\n484\n00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:12.920\nYeah, absolutely,\n\n485\n00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.290\nso I should have pointed that out that\nbasically you're in the Unix environment.\n\n486\n00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:18.090\nYou're in the bath shell.\n\n487\n00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.990\nAnd the bath shell is only going to\nshow you what Unix is used to and so\n\n488\n00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:24.260\nwhen I get back in here, and\nlet me just pull that back up.\n\n489\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:24.800\nThere we go, all right.\n\n490\n00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.120\nSo when I'm looking at the files, you just\nsee that user, the group, and the other.\n\n491\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.350\nThese guys right here.\n\n492\n00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.740\nThese 9 bits that are layed\nout identifying that\n\n493\n00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.160\nthose are the permissions.\n\n494\n00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:39.285\nWhat about marketing and\nwhat about all employees, whatever?\n\n495\n00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:41.650\nAnd that's why I came to\nthe shell in the first place.\n\n496\n00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.210\nRemember my GUI is not playing nice for\nus.\n\n497\n00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.969\nStill fetching, so\nI need to make sure that's right.\n\n498\n00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:50.920\nHow do I make sure it's right\nif it's still saying fetching?\n\n499\n00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.765\nEventually it's 'gonna update\nto reflect it but for now.\n\n500\n00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:55.481\nWell In the command prompt,\n\n501\n00:23:55.481 --> 00:24:00.070\nwhat I need to do is I need to tell it\nto show me the extended permissions.\n\n502\n00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.340\nAnd it doesn't do that by default,\n\n503\n00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.390\nby default it shows me\nthe normal permissions.\n\n504\n00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:10.350\nSo if I take the ls -lahe that I've been\nrunning, and I'm just gonna add in e.\n\n505\n00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:14.350\nSo l for the list dial output,\nfor the long output.\n\n506\n00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:17.340\nA, to show me all files\nincluding hidden ones.\n\n507\n00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.330\nH, to make the size human readable.\n\n508\n00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:24.780\nAnd then E,\nto show the extended permissions, the ACL.\n\n509\n00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.830\nWhen I run that now the output's\na little bit different.\n\n510\n00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:31.371\nAnd what I can see as I\nkind of browse around,\n\n511\n00:24:31.371 --> 00:24:35.820\nis here is Document.rtf with the same\npermissions that I saw before.\n\n512\n00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.240\nBut then right after it,\nhere's my ACL entries.\n\n513\n00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.550\nWhat goes beyond the Unix permissions.\n\n514\n00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:46.809\nAnd here's AllEmployees and\nHumanResources, just like we expected.\n\n515\n00:24:46.809 --> 00:24:48.353\nAnd I can verify they're correct.\n\n516\n00:24:48.353 --> 00:24:52.785\nUnder HumanResources I can see\nthat it has read and write.\n\n517\n00:24:52.785 --> 00:24:57.320\nAnd under AllEmployees, I can see that\nit has read, and it doesn't have write.\n\n518\n00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.050\nSo even though my GUI didn't update to\nshow this, I can verify it right here and\n\n519\n00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.260\nI know I assigned it right, and\ndidn't get ' backwards or whatever.\n\n520\n00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.100\nSo it does it show up.\n\n521\n00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.020\n>> Don, is that an integration that\nthey had to do with the Unix system,\n\n522\n00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.560\nthat I guess it's BSD here on Mac OS?\n\n523\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.410\nIs that something I had to add to\nthe Unix system that's underlying?\n\n524\n00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.320\n>> Yeah, Apple did that and Unix,\n\n525\n00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.140\nwhat all this stuff is really based on\nat the end of the day, Linux and Mac OS.\n\n526\n00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.360\nThe Unix operating system was private\nproperty was created by AT&T and\n\n527\n00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.070\nit was their own kind of\nintellectual property.\n\n528\n00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.130\nAnd then the University\nof California Berkeley,\n\n529\n00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:34.720\nthey started creating their own\nvariation of this which was called BSD.\n\n530\n00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.360\nSo they started adding tools,\nadding features, adding bells and\n\n531\n00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.980\nwhistles that weren't found in Unix.\n\n532\n00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.153\nAnd the Unix world eventually\nstarted adopting those BSD tools.\n\n533\n00:25:42.153 --> 00:25:45.825\nBut BSD was a lot of add ons and\nApple has just continued with that, and\n\n534\n00:25:45.825 --> 00:25:46.976\ncontinued to add on.\n\n535\n00:25:46.976 --> 00:25:50.437\nAnd the cool part is, a lot of what they\nadd on they return back to the community.\n\n536\n00:25:50.437 --> 00:25:53.696\nSo they share it back over, and you start\nseeing these same features in FreeBSD and\n\n537\n00:25:53.696 --> 00:25:55.032\nOpenBSD, and those other guys.\n\n538\n00:25:55.032 --> 00:25:57.580\nBut a lot of this stuff\nwas added on by Apple.\n\n539\n00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.000\nBut here I can see those attributes, and\n\n540\n00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.600\nnow I'm freed from that\nlimitation that Unix has.\n\n541\n00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.083\nUnix of just having user, group, other.\n\n542\n00:26:06.083 --> 00:26:08.684\nHere we have user group other and\nthen what ever else we wanna add.\n\n543\n00:26:08.684 --> 00:26:10.448\nWe can add other people, other groups.\n\n544\n00:26:10.448 --> 00:26:12.897\nYou can expand until\nyour heart's content and\n\n545\n00:26:12.897 --> 00:26:17.120\nreally get some crazy stuff in there all\nright here in part of the file system.\n\n546\n00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.305\n>> I guess it was a really smart idea that\nthey already had the x for executable and\n\n547\n00:26:20.305 --> 00:26:22.717\nnot e because otherwise they\njust can't spell very well.\n\n548\n00:26:22.717 --> 00:26:25.677\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz executable does start with e.\n\n549\n00:26:25.677 --> 00:26:26.265\n>> It gets confusing.\n>> But\n\n550\n00:26:26.265 --> 00:26:28.341\nnow we get to use e for the extended.\n\n551\n00:26:28.341 --> 00:26:29.750\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n552\n00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.190\nAnd so we need to be able to see\nthat stuff, it's all right there.\n\n553\n00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:33.840\nIt works out pretty well.\n\n554\n00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.430\nGetting these permissions\nset is kind of a key thing.\n\n555\n00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.690\nWe are gonna have to see some\ntroubleshooting which I know,\n\n556\n00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.280\nI definitely don't have enough time for\nin this episode.\n\n557\n00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.145\nBut another thing is, I haven't really\nchanged the permissions either and\n\n558\n00:26:44.145 --> 00:26:46.934\non the exam, they want to know how to\nchange the permissions from the GUI.\n\n559\n00:26:46.934 --> 00:26:49.100\nI guess I did show you that,\nthat was easy enough.\n\n560\n00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.690\nBut we need to know how to change the\npermissions from the command line also.\n\n561\n00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:56.170\nSo we're gonna walk through what\nthose tools are for modifying.\n\n562\n00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:58.530\nAnd I've showed you how to view\nthe permissions from the command line, but\n\n563\n00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.970\nnot to actually modify them.\n\n564\n00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.980\nWe'll get a chance to see that,\nand I know what you're thinking.\n\n565\n00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.020\nWhy the heck would I want to do it from\nthe command line when I can do it from\n\n566\n00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:06.920\nthe GUI?\n\n567\n00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.570\nAnd the answer is if you wanna change\nthe permissions for a single file, or\n\n568\n00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:11.830\na single folder.\n\n569\n00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:12.680\nGreat, do it.\n\n570\n00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.490\nJust change it in the GUI.\n\n571\n00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.690\nBut if you have a whole hierarchy, if you\nhave thousands of files that you wanna\n\n572\n00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:21.090\nchange the permissions of,\nyou'll wanna do it from the command line.\n\n573\n00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.596\nAnd the main reason is,\nwhen you create files and folders and\n\n574\n00:27:24.596 --> 00:27:28.121\nstuff you have this permissions\ninheritance that happens.\n\n575\n00:27:28.121 --> 00:27:29.616\nLet me show you what\npermissions inheritance is,\n\n576\n00:27:29.616 --> 00:27:31.140\nI definitely have time for that.\n\n577\n00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:36.612\nSo I made this document and in the\ndocument, if I pull up the permissions,\n\n578\n00:27:36.612 --> 00:27:42.015\nit's got, well these guys are still\nfetching, that is just beyond me.\n\n579\n00:27:42.015 --> 00:27:45.373\nBut I've got these basic permissions here,\nand you know what?\n\n580\n00:27:45.373 --> 00:27:48.000\nLet's just kill those permissions,\nI'm just gonna get those out of there.\n\n581\n00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.750\nAnd I am gonna say that\nI got Read & Write, and\n\n582\n00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:55.320\nthe staff has Read & Write, and\nthat everyone else has No Access.\n\n583\n00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.931\nSo users on my computer and\nmy self will have Read & Write,\n\n584\n00:27:58.931 --> 00:28:01.815\nevery one else will have\nnothing on this file.\n\n585\n00:28:01.815 --> 00:28:04.869\nSo that's the permissions\nthat are on this document.\n\n586\n00:28:04.869 --> 00:28:06.750\nI'm gonna take this folder.\n\n587\n00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:09.848\nAnd on the folder,\nI'm gonna come in here and I'm gonna say,\n\n588\n00:28:09.848 --> 00:28:13.497\nthe staff gets read only, everyone\ngets read only, I get Read & Write.\n\n589\n00:28:13.497 --> 00:28:16.818\nAnd then I'm gonna add\njust human resources.\n\n590\n00:28:16.818 --> 00:28:19.750\nSo I'm gonna select that\nhuman resources group and\n\n591\n00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.290\nI'm gonna make that one Read & Write.\n\n592\n00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:23.914\nNow, there's one other\npermission that just showed up.\n\n593\n00:28:23.914 --> 00:28:28.048\nWe didn't see that one earlier,\nwhich is Write only Drop Box.\n\n594\n00:28:28.048 --> 00:28:31.516\nI talk about that in another episode in\nour sharing episode, that means that they\n\n595\n00:28:31.516 --> 00:28:35.110\ncan write data to the folder but\nthen they can't read it again afterwards.\n\n596\n00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:39.080\nThey can drop something off so that I\ncan get, but they can't see it anymore.\n\n597\n00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.210\nIt's like a night deposit box at a bank,\nyou can slide that envelope in there and\n\n598\n00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:42.870\nthen it's gone.\n\n599\n00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.800\nYou can't get it anymore.\n\n600\n00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.100\nThat's how this is, so\nthat’s another option that you might see.\n\n601\n00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.780\nSo I’m gonna leave that as Read & Write.\n\n602\n00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.670\nSo I want human resources to have that.\n\n603\n00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.210\nEverybody else is just getting Read Only.\n\n604\n00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.751\nSo once I've got that in place or heck,\n\n605\n00:28:57.751 --> 00:28:59.913\nmaybe I wanna go really\nstrict on this stuff.\n\n606\n00:28:59.913 --> 00:29:02.498\nSo I wanna take staff and oops,\n\n607\n00:29:02.498 --> 00:29:07.780\nI don't wanna break that actually here,\nI gotta unlock that.\n\n608\n00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:11.808\nAnd there we go.\n\n609\n00:29:11.808 --> 00:29:19.020\nSo let me just take staff out and\neveryone to No Access.\n\n610\n00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.650\nSo now, I have Read & Write.\n\n611\n00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.550\nHuman Resources has Read & Write.\n\n612\n00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:24.940\nEveryone else has No Access.\n\n613\n00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.310\nAnd I took staff out.\n\n614\n00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:30.323\nI just killed one of the default Unix\npermissions and swapped it out for\n\n615\n00:29:30.323 --> 00:29:30.943\nnothing.\n\n616\n00:29:30.943 --> 00:29:32.707\nSo there is no group any more.\n\n617\n00:29:32.707 --> 00:29:35.261\nThere's just me and everyone.\n\n618\n00:29:35.261 --> 00:29:40.124\nWell there is a group, the Human Resources\nexcept it's not showing up here.\n\n619\n00:29:40.124 --> 00:29:41.242\nSo now I've got it set.\n\n620\n00:29:41.242 --> 00:29:48.471\nLet's see how it looks in the terminal and\nso I'll just pull up a quick ls -lah.\n\n621\n00:29:48.471 --> 00:29:52.270\nAnd when you look at Don's folder,\nlook what happened to that group.\n\n622\n00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:53.270\nThe group became wheel.\n\n623\n00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.430\nIt didn't become Human Resources.\n\n624\n00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:01.269\nHuman Resources is tucked away\nin the extended attributes.\n\n625\n00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:03.520\nSo there's Human Resources right there.\n\n626\n00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.260\nBut wheel is now the group assigned to it.\n\n627\n00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.180\nAnd wheel, that's the super secret\n\n628\n00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:11.210\nbehind the scenes services\noperating system group.\n\n629\n00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:12.520\nIt's a very powerful group.\n\n630\n00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.760\nIt's kind of what your root\nuser's apart of to be able to do\n\n631\n00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.680\nthe super user commands.\n\n632\n00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.479\nSo the wheel group is very special,\nit's very powerful.\n\n633\n00:30:20.479 --> 00:30:22.260\nIt's basically your operating system.\n\n634\n00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.650\nSo it's taken that away from staff,\nfrom regular users and\n\n635\n00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:26.720\njust given it to operating system.\n\n636\n00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.530\nNow why does the operating system need it?\n\n637\n00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.980\nWell, imagine you're running\ntime machine backups.\n\n638\n00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.342\nHow can you back up a file that\nthe system can't even read?\n\n639\n00:30:33.342 --> 00:30:34.340\nIt needs that access.\n\n640\n00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:37.387\nSo at a minimum, the operating system\nneeds to get access to it and so\n\n641\n00:30:37.387 --> 00:30:39.321\nthat's why wheel gets injected in there.\n\n642\n00:30:39.321 --> 00:30:42.745\nNow, you'll notice that wheel doesn't\nactually have any permission assigned\n\n643\n00:30:42.745 --> 00:30:43.256\nover here.\n\n644\n00:30:43.256 --> 00:30:46.199\nIf I look at the group it's dash,\ndash, dash, but\n\n645\n00:30:46.199 --> 00:30:49.860\nthe upper link system still has\nthe ability to get access to it.\n\n646\n00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.700\nSo those permissions are now\nassigned to this folder.\n\n647\n00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.650\nAnd here's where things\nget a little squirrely is,\n\n648\n00:30:55.650 --> 00:31:00.850\nwhat happens when I take this document and\nI put it into this folder?\n\n649\n00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.410\nComparing the permissions\nbetween the document and\n\n650\n00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.540\nthe folder, if I look down on it.\n\n651\n00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.940\nThe document, I have Read & Write,\n\n652\n00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.840\nstaff has Read & Write,\neveryone else has No Access.\n\n653\n00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.600\nThe folder,\n\n654\n00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:17.070\nI have Read & Write, Human Resources has\nRead & Write, everyone else has No Access.\n\n655\n00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:22.043\nSo it's different permissions or here\nactually or maybe I'll just make this one.\n\n656\n00:31:22.043 --> 00:31:23.150\nEverybody has Read & Write.\n\n657\n00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.590\nLet's just go crazy on that one.\n\n658\n00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.680\nWhen I take this file and\nput it on that folder what's gonna happen?\n\n659\n00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.290\nWell if I take it, I drag it and\nthen drop it, and throw it in there.\n\n660\n00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:38.720\nWell now, when I browse into that\nfolder and I take that file.\n\n661\n00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.986\nAnd I look at it, all it's\npermissions are still Read & Write.\n\n662\n00:31:42.986 --> 00:31:46.106\nThey're still Read & Write,\nbecause I moved the file in there and\n\n663\n00:31:46.106 --> 00:31:47.620\nit kept it's own permissions.\n\n664\n00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:52.910\nSo Human Resources has Read & Write\non the folder, but not on this file.\n\n665\n00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.660\nThe permissions didn't update,\nthey didn't carry over.\n\n666\n00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:59.473\nAnd so that's a problem, but\nif I look at that here in my terminal.\n\n667\n00:31:59.473 --> 00:32:04.320\nSo looking in here,\nI can see the Don's folder that I made.\n\n668\n00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:08.105\nAnd in Don's folder I can see that\nHumanResources has permissions on it.\n\n669\n00:32:08.105 --> 00:32:10.120\nThey have everything, so Read & Write.\n\n670\n00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:14.646\nAnd then if I get inside of\nDon's folder and I take a look.\n\n671\n00:32:14.646 --> 00:32:19.990\nThere's that file,\nDocument.rtf and it's got\n\n672\n00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:23.330\nno extended permissions and everybody's\ngot access, the permissions didn't update.\n\n673\n00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:29.310\nWhen you move a file the permissions\ndon't update and that's a problem.\n\n674\n00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:32.000\nThat's where I might need to go to\nthe command prompt if I'm moving a ton of\n\n675\n00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.670\nfiles, and\nI wanna reset all the permissions.\n\n676\n00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.420\nAnd I wanna do that from\nthe command prompt,\n\n677\n00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.720\ncuz I can override this permissions.\n\n678\n00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.560\nYou get different behaviour when you copy.\n\n679\n00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:45.360\nSo for example, instead of moving, if I'd\ntaken that file and copied it instead.\n\n680\n00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.680\nSo see here the original is still on\nmy desktop and now I've made a copy.\n\n681\n00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:54.160\nWhen you make a copy, things can\ngo a little bit different for us.\n\n682\n00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.401\nSo let me just pull this\nup here real quick.\n\n683\n00:32:56.401 --> 00:32:58.846\nAnd now that I've copy it over.\n\n684\n00:32:58.846 --> 00:33:00.843\nWell, nope actually it stayed the same.\n\n685\n00:33:00.843 --> 00:33:03.277\nSo I still have that -rw-rw-rw-.\n\n686\n00:33:03.277 --> 00:33:06.899\nIt hasn't changed, and\nthe permissions don't match the folder.\n\n687\n00:33:06.899 --> 00:33:09.123\nSo that's where changing from\nthe command line comes in handy and\n\n688\n00:33:09.123 --> 00:33:11.112\nthat's part of what we're\ngonna see in the next episode.\n\n689\n00:33:11.112 --> 00:33:13.712\n>> Well Don,\n[COUGH] obviously tons about permissions.\n\n690\n00:33:13.712 --> 00:33:16.570\nThis is not a very light topic.\n\n691\n00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:17.116\nLots of-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n692\n00:33:17.116 --> 00:33:18.115\n>> Indent things.\n\n693\n00:33:18.115 --> 00:33:21.290\nWe need to understand\nexactly what's happening.\n\n694\n00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:25.470\nAnd whenever we move or copy or create\na file, all those permissions are saved.\n\n695\n00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.330\nWe've already started to really\nscratch the surface of that,\n\n696\n00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.000\nbut we got a lot more to go.\n\n697\n00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.636\nWe're well out of time in this episode.\n\n698\n00:33:30.636 --> 00:33:32.681\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we knew that was coming.\n\n699\n00:33:32.681 --> 00:33:33.522\n>> You kind of-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n700\n00:33:33.522 --> 00:33:36.385\n>> Set the stage for that so\nwe look forward to seeing you in part two.\n\n701\n00:33:36.385 --> 00:33:38.184\nWe look forward to seeing you\nguys in part two as well.\n\n702\n00:33:38.184 --> 00:33:39.985\nHopefully, you'll be there.\n\n703\n00:33:39.985 --> 00:33:42.865\nAs for us, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n704\n00:33:42.865 --> 00:33:44.142\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n705\n00:33:44.142 --> 00:33:44.978\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n706\n00:33:44.978 -->

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:20.525\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and today's\nepisode we're continuing on with our Apple\n\n4\n00:00:20.525 --> 00:00:24.050\ncertified support professional\nit is very difficult to say.\n\n5\n00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.390\nBut bringing back the Don Pizet\nhere with us here today\n\n6\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.310\nto help us guide through that\nlittle system of certification.\n\n7\n00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.020\nWe're trying to get that a little\nmore on file permissions.\n\n8\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.090\nWe dived into that in the last episode but\n\n9\n00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.050\nwe gotta go a little bit further,\nright Don?\n\n10\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.870\n>> Absolutely,\nwe saw a lot of the permissions,\n\n11\n00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.000\nI showed you guys modifying\nthe permissions from the GUI.\n\n12\n00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.160\n>> I want to show you from\nthe command line also.\n\n13\n00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.810\nWe're going to take a look at tweaking\nthose permissions and getting then set up.\n\n14\n00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.410\nI've mentioned how important that was if\nyou have a whole file hierarchy that you\n\n15\n00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.920\nwanted to change, you can do that\nreally easily from the command prompt,\n\n16\n00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.950\nfrom the back shell.\n\n17\n00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.500\nSo, on my workstation I'll just go\nahead and fire up a terminal window and\n\n18\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.430\nlet's get kindastarted\nby creating a folder.\n\n19\n00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.230\nI need to make it bigger so\nI can actually read it.\n\n20\n00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.660\n>> But I needed to make a folder so\nwe can start assigning permissions and\n\n21\n00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.820\ndoing things to it.\n\n22\n00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.320\nI'm going to whip up a folder, and\n\n23\n00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.850\nlet's remember that same\nexample I did in the last show.\n\n24\n00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.500\nI've got an employee handbook\nthat I want to hand out.\n\n25\n00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.050\nRight?\nSo I'm going to have a human resources\n\n26\n00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.270\nfolder and I'm going to share this out on\nthe network so that people can get it.\n\n27\n00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.770\nLet me get on to my desktop here.\n\n28\n00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.260\nAnd, I'm just going to make a folder\ncalled Human Resources, all right.\n\n29\n00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.930\nSo I've now got a folder\ncalled Human Resources.\n\n30\n00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.580\nAnd when I created that it got a default\nset up permissions, all right.\n\n31\n00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.070\nAnd where did the default set\nup permissions come from?\n\n32\n00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.510\nWell they were inherited from\nthe folder I created in.\n\n33\n00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.840\nSo it got this default set up\npermissions that were place on it.\n\n34\n00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.770\nAnd so I can see that right now,\nI've got Read and Write.\n\n35\n00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.970\nStaff has read only,\n\n36\n00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.580\neveryone has read only, those are the\npermission assigned to this folder.\n\n37\n00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.280\nAnd inside of that folder,\nif I start to, [LAUGH] there we go.\n\n38\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.800\nIf I start to create files, right?\n\n39\n00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.550\nSo, if I create a, maybe we have\na Employeehandbook.pdf, right.\n\n40\n00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.920\nSo I've got this\nEmployeehandbook pdf file, and\n\n41\n00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.460\nif I do an LS-L, I'll see the long\noutput and I can see, there it is.\n\n42\n00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.410\nI've got read and write.\n\n43\n00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.510\nThe group, which in this case,\nthe staff, has read.\n\n44\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.850\nAnd then everyone else has read also.\n\n45\n00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.280\nThose are the default permissions\nassigned to this file.\n\n46\n00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.480\n>> If I wanna modify those\nfrom the command line,\n\n47\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.640\nthere's actually more than\none way to go about it.\n\n48\n00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.650\nBut the BSD way is actually pretty easy.\n\n49\n00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.370\nWhen you start digging through Unix\ndocuments and Linux documents,\n\n50\n00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.090\nyou'll see all sorts of things about these\nnumerical representations of permissions.\n\n51\n00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.960\nAnd the numerical representations\nare really hard to remember, and so\n\n52\n00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.280\nApple really doesn't push those very hard.\n\n53\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.590\nWhat they have us do is use the BSD\nstyle notations which are actually\n\n54\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.100\nreally easy to remember.\n\n55\n00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.970\nRemember from the last episode that I\nsaid permissions are broken down into\n\n56\n00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.840\nthree pieces, you've got the user,\nwhich is the person that created it.\n\n57\n00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.300\nThe group, which is the group that\nis attached by defaulted staff.\n\n58\n00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.260\nAnd then everyone else,\nwhich is called the other, right?\n\n59\n00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.620\nSo user, group, other,\nthose are the three.\n\n60\n00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.390\nAnd if I wanna change\npermissions on something,\n\n61\n00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.270\nlike this EmployeeHandbook, I might\nwanna change it so that I'm the user, so\n\n62\n00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.850\nI want read and write,\nwell I've already got that, that's great.\n\n63\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.460\nAnd then let's say that the group that's\nassigned to it Is human resources.\n\n64\n00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.210\nSo I got a human resources group and\n\n65\n00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.380\nthat's what I want them to\nhave write permissions.\n\n66\n00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.580\nWell looking at it here,\nthey're missing write permissions.\n\n67\n00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.040\nSo I want to add it.\n\n68\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.890\nWell adding it's really not that hard.\n\n69\n00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.180\nWhat you do is you type chmod, so\nwe're modifying the permissions.\n\n70\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.110\nAnd then we're gonna say,\nthe group, so just g+w.\n\n71\n00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.270\nI'm adding write permissions for\nthe group.\n\n72\n00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.870\nSo this first letter, the first letter\ncould be a u for the user, a g for\n\n73\n00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.980\nthe group, or o for other, right?\n\n74\n00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.940\nOr in Mac OS land,\nthe u would represent the owner.\n\n75\n00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.850\nThe g would represent\nstaff in this case and\n\n76\n00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.900\nthen the o would represent everyone,\nand you could just do plus or minus.\n\n77\n00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.770\nI could take away a permission, so\nI could say I want to do group plus w, and\n\n78\n00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.080\nthen i'll point it at that employee\nhandbook, and I'll apply it.\n\n79\n00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.970\nAnd once that's done,\nif I take a look at it,\n\n80\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.150\nnow I can see sure enough the group has\nwrite permissions just like I wanted.\n\n81\n00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.790\nOkay, so easy enough if I\njust remember the letters.\n\n82\n00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.890\nSo U, G, O for the object that\nwe're assigning permissions to.\n\n83\n00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.760\nAnd then R, W, X for read, write, execute.\n\n84\n00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.630\nAnd you can add more than one permission\nor take away more than one mission.\n\n85\n00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.270\nAnd you can even do it\nto more than on thing.\n\n86\n00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.400\nSo for example I could say chmod,\nlet's do g o,\n\n87\n00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.510\nso this will be the group and\nthe other, right?\n\n88\n00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.410\nSo, staff and everyone and\nI could say -rw.\n\n89\n00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.570\nI'm gonna take away both read and\nwrite from those guys.\n\n90\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.940\nAnd when I run it.\n\n91\n00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.160\nIt's gonna get a little mad at me,\nit isn't.\n\n92\n00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.420\nIt's getting mad, because I don't actually\nhave write permissions on one of them but\n\n93\n00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.880\nwe can do it one at a time.\n\n94\n00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.507\nSo, I can do it like.\n\n95\n00:05:02.507 --> 00:05:07.170\n[LAUGH] It's probably because\nI'm not giving it a file name,\n\n96\n00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.920\nwhich is kind of needs to know\nwhere I want to apply this.\n\n97\n00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.890\nSo let me specify that real quick so\nthat if I come in here and\n\n98\n00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.000\nmy head is going to cover this up, but\nthat and my lack of proper spelling.\n\n99\n00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.660\nThere we go, now it's happy.\n\n100\n00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.490\nSo, I'm doing Chmod g o, so\nit's the group and the other minus rw.\n\n101\n00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.420\nI'm taking away read and\nwrite from EmployeeHandbook.pdf right?\n\n102\n00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.090\nAnd so, that's what I'm modifying, and so\nif I take a look at what we end up with,\n\n103\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.730\nI can see that now I have read and\nwrite, everybody else has nothing.\n\n104\n00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.240\nThat's not very hard to do.\n\n105\n00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.590\nThe other style.\n\n106\n00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:48.000\nThe Linux or Unix style or we had to\ndo CH Mud 755 or 644 or whatever those.\n\n107\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.880\nYou've got to figure out which\nnumber corresponds to just read,\n\n108\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.280\nwhich one corresponds read and\nwrite and so on.\n\n109\n00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.650\nAnd it gets really kinda difficult, right?\n\n110\n00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.850\n>> It's like doing math to try\nto figure out permissions.\n\n111\n00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:58.965\nI don't wanna do that.\n\n112\n00:05:58.965 --> 00:05:59.465\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n113\n00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:00.965\nI mean, you can certainly do it that way.\n\n114\n00:06:00.965 --> 00:06:01.980\nIt does work if.\n\n115\n00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.170\nIf you remember what they\nare you can certainly do that,\n\n116\n00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.790\nbut I usually do this method.\n\n117\n00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.000\nThe BSD method is so\nmuch easier to reference.\n\n118\n00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.270\nIt just works out a lot easier.\n\n119\n00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.320\n>> Well Don,\nwe've seen how to take a group and other.\n\n120\n00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.220\nSay I wanna do a group and other, but\n\n121\n00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.520\nwhat if I have I want to give different\npermissions to group and other.\n\n122\n00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.670\nCan I do that as well?\n\n123\n00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.200\n>> You can.\nAndy you can do them one at a time or\n\n124\n00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.360\nyou can even chain them together.\n\n125\n00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.580\nSo let's do a more complex environment.\n\n126\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.680\nLet's say that I've got a script, right?\n\n127\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.550\nSo, let's just say I've got a.\n\n128\n00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.530\n>> Got that hillbilly\nphonics going on touch.\n\n129\n00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.340\n>> I know.\nI cannot type today at all.\n\n130\n00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.470\nSo, I'm going to create a a file\ncalled install to s h, right?\n\n131\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.780\nSo, an s h file would\nnormally be a shell script.\n\n132\n00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.130\nAnd with the default permissions,\nnobody has the permission to execute it.\n\n133\n00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.200\nAnd in the GUI you don't even see\nthe execute bin, it's not there.\n\n134\n00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.410\nSo if I wanna give people permission\nto execute it, but not modify it.\n\n135\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.020\nSo, maybe I want to be able to read,\nwrite and execute.\n\n136\n00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.920\nI want my group to be able to read and\nexecute and\n\n137\n00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.210\nI want everyone else to have no access.\n\n138\n00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.900\nOkay?\n\n139\n00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.880\nWell I can specify a chain of permissions.\n\n140\n00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.820\nAnd I've gotta be careful cuz\nI said plus and minus earlier.\n\n141\n00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.620\nPlus adds permissions, minus takes away.\n\n142\n00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.290\nBut what if I wanna overwrite?\n\n143\n00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.430\nWhat if I wanna take away and\nadd at the same time.\n\n144\n00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.420\nSo maybe Daniel has read and write, and\nI wanna change it to be read and execute.\n\n145\n00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.920\nI'm taking away write and adding execute.\n\n146\n00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.550\nYou can do that at the same time.\n\n147\n00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.870\nAnd all we have to do is kinda\nseparate this out with some commas.\n\n148\n00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.190\nIt looks confusing, but\nit's actually not that bad.\n\n149\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:37.130\nSo I'm gonna do chmod and I'm gonna\npoint this at a few different people.\n\n150\n00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.430\nI want me, so user, and\nI'm gonna say equals rwx.\n\n151\n00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.640\nOkay?\nIn other words,\n\n152\n00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.340\nI don't care what I have right now.\n\n153\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.433\nWhatever it is I wanna\nreplace it with this.\n\n154\n00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:51.148\nSo I'm not doing minus to take away or\nplus to add,\n\n155\n00:07:51.148 --> 00:07:55.849\nI'm just saying this is what\nit's gonna be so u=rwx,g= rx.\n\n156\n00:07:55.849 --> 00:08:01.650\nNow if group already has write, it's gonna\ntake that away cuz I did equal, not plus.\n\n157\n00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.190\nPlus would add read and execute, and\nit would leave write if they still had it.\n\n158\n00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.730\nWell, if somebody can write and execute\nthe script, that's dangerous, and so\n\n159\n00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.930\nI don't want that.\n\n160\n00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.163\nAnd then I can come in and say the other,\nwell I don't want them to have anything.\n\n161\n00:08:14.163 --> 00:08:17.042\nSo I'm just gonna say -rwx, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:20.730\nSo for the other, we're going to\ntake away read, write and execute.\n\n163\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.016\nAnd by doing all that, and remembering\nto put in our final name this time,\n\n164\n00:08:24.016 --> 00:08:26.700\nI can run that, and\nnow I have hard set permissions.\n\n165\n00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.730\nDifferent permissions for\nuser, group and other.\n\n166\n00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.580\nAnd did it all at the same time, just\nby separating them out with commas, so\n\n167\n00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.240\nyou can get really specific.\n\n168\n00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.340\nAnd, again,\nnot that hard to remember all these.\n\n169\n00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.110\nAnd if we come in and\n\n170\n00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.040\ntake a look at what we end up with,\nhere's the EmployeeHandbook.\n\n171\n00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.780\nAnd I have read, write, execute,\nmy group has read and execute,\n\n172\n00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.470\nand everyone else has dashes.\n\n173\n00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.260\nThat's the end of it, right?\n\n174\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.810\nSo permissions are assigned and\nnow we're in business.\n\n175\n00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.140\n>> Now, Don,\nwhat about setting permissions?\n\n176\n00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.330\nWe talked earlier about\nyou've got a directory,\n\n177\n00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.320\nit's probably got stuff inside of it, and\n\n178\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.920\na lot of times I want to set permissions\nthroughout that entire directory.\n\n179\n00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.150\nCan I do that as well from a single line?\n\n180\n00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.760\n>> Sure, and actually some of you guys\nmight have noticed, I screwed up,\n\n181\n00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.660\nI didn't realize I screwed up, I just\nassigned those execute permissions to my\n\n182\n00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.678\nemployee handbook and\nnot the install script.\n\n183\n00:09:11.678 --> 00:09:13.180\n>> Gosh [LAUGH].\n>> So I applied it to the wrong file.\n\n184\n00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.956\nSo now, I'm like no I messed this up and\n\n185\n00:09:14.956 --> 00:09:18.220\nI assigned some permissions somewhere\nwhere I really shouldn't have.\n\n186\n00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.430\nSo maybe I wanna scrape\nthat whole folder and\n\n187\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.070\njust let's remove the execute\nbit from everything, right?\n\n188\n00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.000\nI don't want any of this stuff to be\nexecutable across the whole folder, okay.\n\n189\n00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.550\nWell if I move up one directory, so\nI'm gonna move up here to my desktop, and\n\n190\n00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.210\nthat's where the HumanResources folder,\nitself, exists, right.\n\n191\n00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.910\nSo there's the HumanResources folder, and\nhere's all the permissions assigned to it.\n\n192\n00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.330\nNow, on a directory you\nexpect to see the execute bit\n\n193\n00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.480\nbecause people that double-click on\nthe folder to get into it, and a lot of\n\n194\n00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.348\nsystems refer to that as executing,\nit's not unusual for me to see that.\n\n195\n00:09:52.348 --> 00:09:57.050\nBut if wanna get every file inside of\nthere, and all of the subdirectories,\n\n196\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.740\ncuz there might be directories upon\ndirectories upon directories underneath\n\n197\n00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.520\nit, I can use the -R command\nline attribute to modify chmod.\n\n198\n00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:10.881\nSo I can say chmod -R,\nwhich makes it recursive.\n\n199\n00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:15.424\nI'm gonna change this folder and\neverything underneath it, right,\n\n200\n00:10:15.424 --> 00:10:17.509\nso now I can do a big bulk change.\n\n201\n00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:23.112\nAnd I'm gonna say ugo-x, so\nI'm gonna take away the execute bit for\n\n202\n00:10:23.112 --> 00:10:25.721\neverything inside of here, and\n\n203\n00:10:25.721 --> 00:10:30.761\nI'm gonna point it in to\nthe HumanResources folder, right.\n\n204\n00:10:30.761 --> 00:10:34.644\nSo chmod -R ugo -x,\ntaking away that execute bit,\n\n205\n00:10:34.644 --> 00:10:38.715\nfor everything inside of\nthe HumanResources folder.\n\n206\n00:10:38.715 --> 00:10:42.010\nSo I'm just gonna add a little asterisk\nhere to the end of it represent everything\n\n207\n00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.225\ninside of that folder.\n\n208\n00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:46.075\nIf I leave that asterisk off,\nit'll actually try and\n\n209\n00:10:46.075 --> 00:10:48.205\nchange it on the folder so\nI have to be careful with that.\n\n210\n00:10:48.205 --> 00:10:49.545\nI don't necessarily want\nto change the folder,\n\n211\n00:10:49.545 --> 00:10:51.685\nI want to change what's inside of it.\n\n212\n00:10:51.685 --> 00:10:53.165\nI just as well could have done this,\nI guess,\n\n213\n00:10:53.165 --> 00:10:56.312\nfrom inside of HumanResources\nwould've worked, also.\n\n214\n00:10:56.312 --> 00:10:58.012\nBut we'll do it from here.\n\n215\n00:10:58.012 --> 00:10:59.092\nAll right, so once that's run,\n\n216\n00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:02.152\nI'm gonna verify the folder\ngot left alone, and it did.\n\n217\n00:11:02.152 --> 00:11:04.732\nSee how the folder still\nhas those execute bits?\n\n218\n00:11:04.732 --> 00:11:07.692\nAnd if I change into\nthe HumanResources folder, and\n\n219\n00:11:07.692 --> 00:11:12.002\nwe take a look in here, there's my install\nscript and my EmployeeHandbook, and\n\n220\n00:11:12.002 --> 00:11:14.310\nthe execute bits have been removed, right.\n\n221\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.085\nSo I'm able to make a change across all of\nthese to get them set the way I wanted.\n\n222\n00:11:18.085 --> 00:11:21.450\nOr if I just wanna change\nthe directory as a whole and\n\n223\n00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.260\nkinda put everything back\nto the way that I want.\n\n224\n00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.650\nMaybe I just want me and\nthe group to be able to read and write,\n\n225\n00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.450\nand everybody else just\nto be able to read.\n\n226\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.785\nSo I could do a chmod -R.\n\n227\n00:11:34.785 --> 00:11:39.146\nUser and group = rw, and\n\n228\n00:11:39.146 --> 00:11:44.142\nthen other = read, there.\n\n229\n00:11:44.142 --> 00:11:49.529\nAnd then just do a ./*, right.\n\n230\n00:11:49.529 --> 00:11:52.550\nSo everything in here and underneath it.\n\n231\n00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.930\nAnd so we can run that.\n\n232\n00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.650\nAnd now those permissions get put\nback the way that I want, right.\n\n233\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.290\nSo easy to make bulk\nchanges across the system.\n\n234\n00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.032\nAnd that's not the only part.\n\n235\n00:12:02.032 --> 00:12:05.797\nI can change permissions\nthis way using chmod,\n\n236\n00:12:05.797 --> 00:12:09.970\nI can also change the people\nattached to it, right.\n\n237\n00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.540\nSo the owner and the group.\n\n238\n00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.150\nSee how the group by default is staff.\n\n239\n00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.970\nWhat if I want it to be HumanResources,\nright?\n\n240\n00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:18.780\nI can change that from here.\n\n241\n00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.950\nI can't change it from the GUI.\n\n242\n00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:24.500\nRemember what happened if I took away\nstaff and I added HumanResources?\n\n243\n00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.340\nThis didn't become HumanResources,\nthis became wheel, right.\n\n244\n00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.670\nIt took it away and\nassigned it to the system.\n\n245\n00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.470\nBut from the command line, I can actually\nmake that HumanResources right from here.\n\n246\n00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.680\nIf I want HumanResources to own\nthe EmployeeHandbook, all right,\n\n247\n00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.487\nI can leave myself as the owner and\nI can use chown, which is change owner.\n\n248\n00:12:42.487 --> 00:12:46.520\nSo I wanna change the ownership\nof this file, and\n\n249\n00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:51.480\nI'm gonna say that I want\nthe user to be dpezet, and\n\n250\n00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.320\nthen I'll do a colon and\nwho I want the group to be.\n\n251\n00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.732\nAnd so\nI'm gonna make it dpezet:HumanResources,\n\n252\n00:12:58.732 --> 00:13:00.200\nI think is the name of that group.\n\n253\n00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.740\nActually, let me verify the name\nof that group real quick.\n\n254\n00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.842\nWe made it in the last episode and\nit's been more than five minutes.\n\n255\n00:13:04.842 --> 00:13:06.687\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I can't remember what it was.\n\n256\n00:13:06.687 --> 00:13:11.910\nRemember, whenever you create\nan object inside of your users and\n\n257\n00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:15.080\ngroups here, that they kind of have\nmore than one identity, right?\n\n258\n00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:23.000\nThey have a nice user name that you see\nhere, so I see this Human space Resources.\n\n259\n00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.870\nBut that's not how it shows up in UNIX.\n\n260\n00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.900\nAnd so there will be a different\nname assigned to it, and\n\n261\n00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:33.050\nif you kind of Ctrl-click or right-click\non it, you can get this Advanced Options.\n\n262\n00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:36.300\nAnd in the Advanced Options you'll see\nthe actual group name right there.\n\n263\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.240\nAnd see how I just took the space out?\n\n264\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.630\nThat's important, but what I was really\nlooking for was whether or not the H and\n\n265\n00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.780\nthe R were capitalized.\n\n266\n00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.080\nAnd so I can see those cuz\nthis stuff is case sensitive.\n\n267\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.590\nSo, that is good for me.\n\n268\n00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.530\nAnd so I'll jump back here to my shell.\n\n269\n00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:53.248\nSo what I'm doing is I'm changing\nthe owner to be dpezet as the owner,\n\n270\n00:13:53.248 --> 00:13:54.695\nas the user.\n\n271\n00:13:54.695 --> 00:13:56.990\nHumanResources to be the group, the g.\n\n272\n00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.010\nEveryone you can't change cuz everyone is,\nwell, it's everyone, right,\n\n273\n00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.040\nthat's just what it is.\n\n274\n00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.339\nSo we'll leave that be, all right.\n\n275\n00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:05.260\nAnd then I kind of need to\ntell it what I'm modifying, so\n\n276\n00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.130\nI'm modifying the EmployeeHandbook.\n\n277\n00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.955\nSo I'll just specify that here at the end.\n\n278\n00:14:08.955 --> 00:14:12.340\nAnd now we're going to\nchange that ownership.\n\n279\n00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.110\nWhen that's done,\nif I take a look at my output,\n\n280\n00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:20.010\nnow dpezet is the user,\nHumanResources is the group.\n\n281\n00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.870\nAnd we modify that, and\nI could've done -R on this one, also.\n\n282\n00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:28.030\nChmod for permission, chown for\nthe owners, and -R works with both.\n\n283\n00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.850\nSo you can do this recursively and\nknock out an entire folder and\n\n284\n00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:31.870\nassign that ownership.\n\n285\n00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.100\nThis was something I\ncouldn't do in the GUI.\n\n286\n00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.050\nIt doesn't let you change that default\ngroup, or if it does I don't know how.\n\n287\n00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.010\nI've never seen anybody do it.\n\n288\n00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.989\nBut if I go in here and\ntake that EmployeeHandbook and\n\n289\n00:14:41.989 --> 00:14:43.350\ndo its little get info.\n\n290\n00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:49.020\nIt's doing that annoying fetching thing\nagain, I don't know what's up with that.\n\n291\n00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.880\nMaybe I'm trying to reach\na directory server.\n\n292\n00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.000\nBut it shows it right there\nthat it's been assigned, and\n\n293\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.850\nit's not set to staff anymore.\n\n294\n00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.445\n>> Don, what's a practical way in which\nwe would use this change of ownership in\n\n295\n00:15:01.445 --> 00:15:03.135\nreal life?\n\n296\n00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:06.290\n>> So, one of the problems you\nbump into when you start going to\n\n297\n00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.330\nthe extended attributes and\nthose additional permissions\n\n298\n00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.980\nis that you're kind of deviating from\nyour standard UNIXy, Linuxy type world.\n\n299\n00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.900\nSo if you're trying to maintain the best\ncompatibility with software and\n\n300\n00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.350\napplications, you might\nbe worried about that and\n\n301\n00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.500\nwant to make things work just\nwith the UNIX permissions.\n\n302\n00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.330\nIf you're doing NFS,\n\n303\n00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.960\nNetwork File Services, it benefits from\nleaving things the old way, and so\n\n304\n00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.130\nyou might want to stick with that just for\ncompatibility purposes.\n\n305\n00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.180\nBut to be honest with you,\nmost software doesn’t differentiate.\n\n306\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.840\nThis is pretty low level stuff,\nthis is in the core operating system, so\n\n307\n00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.840\nyour applications don’t even\nnormally see it happen.\n\n308\n00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.450\nSo there's not a ton of need\nto dive back in and do it.\n\n309\n00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.455\nThe main reason I cover it here is\ncuz it’s on the exam, [LAUGH] so\n\n310\n00:15:43.455 --> 00:15:45.113\nwe kind of need to know it for that.\n\n311\n00:15:45.113 --> 00:15:48.078\nBut in real life when you're\nsetting up a webserver, so\n\n312\n00:15:48.078 --> 00:15:51.992\nif you're using the website's feature\ninside of the OS10 server app,\n\n313\n00:15:51.992 --> 00:15:55.968\nyou'll need to jump into those\ndirectories and set permissions to allow,\n\n314\n00:15:55.968 --> 00:15:59.780\nlike php files need to be able to\nbe executed cuz they are scripts.\n\n315\n00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.140\nVersus HTML files that just need\nto be read, they're not scripts.\n\n316\n00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.920\nSo that kind of creates variation.\n\n317\n00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.796\n>> Yeah, one of my favorite ways is that,\nit's inevitable,\n\n318\n00:16:07.796 --> 00:16:09.874\nsomeone eventually leaves or gets fired.\n\n319\n00:16:09.874 --> 00:16:11.048\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm certain I'm gonna\n\n320\n00:16:11.048 --> 00:16:11.570\nbe fired very soon.\n\n321\n00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.270\nAnd all the files that I own will now\nbecome orphan files, so you gotta change\n\n322\n00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:20.370\nthe owner to someone that can actually use\nit [LAUGH] whoever replaces me, right?\n\n323\n00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.500\n>> Yeah, now one thing I didn't\nshow Daniel is right here we saw\n\n324\n00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.350\nchange in the ownership.\n\n325\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.720\nWe saw change the permissions\nvia the command line.\n\n326\n00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.500\nAnd I only change\nthe Unix C side of stuff.\n\n327\n00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.210\nBut we know we can go beyond that right?\n\n328\n00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.920\nWe can do things that\nare in addition to it.\n\n329\n00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.410\nWe saw in the last episode where\nI added human resources and\n\n330\n00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:39.560\nwhat is my other group?\n\n331\n00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.940\nSee this is, I kinda work on\nlike memory skills or something.\n\n332\n00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.100\n>> Marketing.\n>> Marketing, there we go.\n\n333\n00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.430\nSo, we add a marketing.\n\n334\n00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:48.210\nWell, I can only have one group in\nUnix LAN, you can only have one group,\n\n335\n00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:49.210\nthis guy right here.\n\n336\n00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.190\nSo what if I wanna add marketing also?\n\n337\n00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.138\nThat's where the ACL's come in.\n\n338\n00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:54.770\nAnd the ACL's,\nwe can do to through GUI and\n\n339\n00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.930\nI recommend you do,\nunless you wanna do something recursive.\n\n340\n00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.640\nAnd make it apply to huge swaths\nof your directory or whatever.\n\n341\n00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.210\nWell we can actually modify\nthose permissions too.\n\n342\n00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:09.070\nYou can set ACL's from the command line\nbut it's done really, really weird.\n\n343\n00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:14.920\nRemember, in order to view those we had to\nuse the dash e command line modifier for\n\n344\n00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.290\nls, for the list command.\n\n345\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.810\nAnd so if I jump back in here to mine,\nI've been running ls -la.\n\n346\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:26.380\nI'm gonna add an e to that and so\nnow I'm seeing the extended attributes.\n\n347\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.230\nNow I'm saying attributes there.\n\n348\n00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.850\nExtended attributes are really kinda a\nweird thing because there's two different\n\n349\n00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.210\ntypes of extended attributes.\n\n350\n00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.130\nThere's the permissions and\nthen there's everything else.\n\n351\n00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.340\nWhat do I mean by everything else?\n\n352\n00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.530\nWell when I take a file, so\nlet me go to HumanResources and\n\n353\n00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.600\nlet me take EmployeeHandbook I'm\ngonna do a little get info on it.\n\n354\n00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.180\nAnd when I look at my employee handbook,\n\n355\n00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.410\nlook at all this other stuff\nup here like comments.\n\n356\n00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:49.890\nWhat's a comment?\n\n357\n00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.280\nWell it's just some note\nthat I put in here.\n\n358\n00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.560\nSo I might add a comment\nto this that says.\n\n359\n00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:02.130\nOfficial use only or\n\n360\n00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.290\ncall this phone number to report typos or\nwhatever it is that I wanna put in there.\n\n361\n00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:11.590\nIt's just a comment, a little note\nthat I'm sticking onto the file.\n\n362\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.510\nThere's also other things like\nwhether it's lock or stationary.\n\n363\n00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:20.280\nWhether we wanna set where\nthe extension is hidden and so on.\n\n364\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.169\nThese are all special things that\nApple has created that aren't really\n\n365\n00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:28.510\na part of the files as the original\nUnix file definition was defined.\n\n366\n00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:29.870\nSo these are extended attributes.\n\n367\n00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.545\nYou will hear Apple refer\nto them as metadata.\n\n368\n00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:37.250\nMetadata can take a few different forms\nbut these are all just special things.\n\n369\n00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.220\nA great example,\none that doesn't show up here,\n\n370\n00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:43.970\nis in the finder you can take file and\nyou can assign categories to it.\n\n371\n00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.670\nSo when you take one and\n\n372\n00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.250\nthis was a big deal I think in\nMavericks when it came out.\n\n373\n00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.400\nIs that you've got these little tags.\n\n374\n00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.300\nAnd so I can hit edit tags and\nI can give it a red tag or an orange tag.\n\n375\n00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.930\nIf this is a top secret document\nmaybe I want that to be red.\n\n376\n00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.880\nAnd if it's a unclassified document,\nI want that to be green.\n\n377\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.300\nI'm coming in and\nI can just pick those colors and\n\n378\n00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.040\nset it or\nmaybe I don't wanna make colors at all.\n\n379\n00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.450\nSo I'm gonna say it's red but\n\n380\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:12.040\nyou can actually modify the names\nof these things and change.\n\n381\n00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.380\nActually it's not gonna let me do it from\nhere but you can go in and change those or\n\n382\n00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.680\nyou could even add more.\n\n383\n00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.210\nSo you've got some neat\nflexibility here with these tags.\n\n384\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.490\nWell where are these tags being stored?\n\n385\n00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.680\nThey're being stored in\nthis extra metadata.\n\n386\n00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.460\nI want to make it top secret red.\n\n387\n00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.570\nNobody can mistake that.\n\n388\n00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.310\nNot orange.\n\n389\n00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.980\nThere we go, top secret red.\n\n390\n00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:30.500\nI flagged that.\n\n391\n00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:35.130\nNow here in my user interface when\nI'm browsing I see that red dot.\n\n392\n00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.920\nI know, hey this is top secret.\n\n393\n00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.630\nI get a visual cue.\n\n394\n00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.760\nBut UNIX doesn't know that.\n\n395\n00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.400\nUNIX doesn't have these tags.\n\n396\n00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.180\nSo that's extended metadata.\n\n397\n00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.210\nAnd the extended metadata can\nappear a few different ways.\n\n398\n00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:50.410\nThe permissions, the ACL's that we add,\nthose were extended metadata also.\n\n399\n00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:55.950\nNow, when I do the ls-le,\n\n400\n00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:01.900\nor lae in my case, if I do lae,\nthat e is saying show me the ACL.\n\n401\n00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.440\nAnd so I'm gonna see the ACL but\nnot any of the other attributes.\n\n402\n00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.140\nBut I know the attributes are there\nbecause of this little at symbol.\n\n403\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.240\nThe at symbols will let me know\nthere are attributes attached to it.\n\n404\n00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.560\nAnd so if I add an at symbol from the end\nof this I'll see those attributes.\n\n405\n00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.400\nAnd so sure enough when I look in here,\nthere's FinderInfo.\n\n406\n00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.450\nThat's where the red dot and\nthe top secret tag are.\n\n407\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.780\nThere's item user tags or\nactually that's the tags right there.\n\n408\n00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.610\nAnd then item finder comment,\nthere's the comment that I put on it.\n\n409\n00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.060\nSo we've got additional information\n\n410\n00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.180\nthat's attached to this file just kind\nof hidden away and we don't see it.\n\n411\n00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.988\nSo those ACL's,\nthose extended permissions,\n\n412\n00:20:37.988 --> 00:20:39.910\nthey're part of this metadata.\n\n413\n00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.090\nIt's just we have a separate\ncommand to view them.\n\n414\n00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:42.740\nE for\n\n415\n00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.480\nthe permissions ACL's and at for all the\nother metadata attributes attached to it.\n\n416\n00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:52.370\nSo when we create this file it's\ngot extra stuff that's in there and\n\n417\n00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.400\nwe don't normally see it.\n\n418\n00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.150\nIf I do ls-la I don't see it, it's only\nif I run the right command to see it.\n\n419\n00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.070\nAnd if I wanna modify it,\nit's the same way.\n\n420\n00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.850\nSo if I wanna add that marketing group,\n\n421\n00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.190\nI want the marketing group to have\nread access to this employee handbook.\n\n422\n00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.960\nI can say chmod, but\ninstead of doing a u, g, or\n\n423\n00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.110\no, I don't wanna modify any of them,\nI wanna add an attribute.\n\n424\n00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.390\nAnd so I'm gonna say +a.\n\n425\n00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.130\nI'm adding an attribute.\n\n426\n00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:24.050\nAnd the attribute that I want to add,\nthis is where it gets a little weird,\n\n427\n00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:27.770\nis I do this in a specific format\ncuz I'm attaching an attribute.\n\n428\n00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:31.330\nAnd it's going to be marketing,\ncuz that's the name of the group.\n\n429\n00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.370\nAllow, this is an allow attribute.\n\n430\n00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.710\nThat's how it's gonna know\nthis is an ACL entry.\n\n431\n00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.210\nI'm gonna allow read and write.\n\n432\n00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.190\nI'm granting read and\n\n433\n00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.610\nwrite permissions to the marketing\ngroup via the special attribute.\n\n434\n00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.060\nSo that's the special attribute\nthat I'm gonna write and\n\n435\n00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.580\nthen I just need to tell it that\nit's the employee handbook.\n\n436\n00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.350\nAnd so I'll add that on.\n\n437\n00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:58.480\nAnd once that's done I should\nbe able to do an ls -la and\n\n438\n00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:04.120\nthings don't look very different because\nUnix doesn't recognize these extra groups.\n\n439\n00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:11.250\nBut if I do an ls -lae, now I can see\nMarketing has read and write permissions.\n\n440\n00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:12.140\nThey've been added on.\n\n441\n00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:12.810\nSo I can modify.\n\n442\n00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:13.840\nIt's just weird.\n\n443\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.440\nIt's weird cuz we're not\ndong the normal permissions.\n\n444\n00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.400\nWe're adding an attribute but\nyou can do it recursively.\n\n445\n00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.770\nAnd you can add that attribute across an\nentire folder to grant access to a user or\n\n446\n00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.100\na group or\ntakeaway access to a user or group.\n\n447\n00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.050\nIt's all done right there.\n\n448\n00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:27.025\nAnd if I go back into my user interface.\n\n449\n00:22:27.025 --> 00:22:33.850\n>> So Don the real power here in using the\nCLI or the whatever you want to call it.\n\n450\n00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:37.420\nI call it CLI is the bulk\noperation features.\n\n451\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.360\nI can do tons of stuff in one nice\nlittle short sentence, really,\n\n452\n00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.780\nin the command line.\n\n453\n00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.020\n>> Yeah, so normally [LAUGH].\n\n454\n00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.290\nNormally that's the time\nthat I would use it right?\n\n455\n00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:47.460\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's when you want to do bulk changes.\n\n456\n00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.680\nBut it's also useful when you're\nhaving the same problem I am where for\n\n457\n00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.850\nsome reason it's not fetching\nthe name of these stupid groups.\n\n458\n00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.328\n>> [LAUGH] You don't need that name Don.\n\n459\n00:22:53.328 --> 00:22:54.389\n>> I need it.\nIt's funny because\n\n460\n00:22:54.389 --> 00:22:56.504\nI've seen that when dealing\nwith the directory server,\n\n461\n00:22:56.504 --> 00:22:58.590\nI haven't seen it on\na stand-alone machine like this.\n\n462\n00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:59.470\nReally bizarre.\n\n463\n00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:03.230\nSo I'm not quite sure why it's doing\nthat but anyhow so it's another chance.\n\n464\n00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.960\nYou go and verify permissions or if you\njust wanna script something, if you wanna\n\n465\n00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.550\nautomate it, I wanna give Daniel\npermissions starting tomorrow at midnight.\n\n466\n00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.750\nAnd I wanna take away his permissions\nthe next day at midnight.\n\n467\n00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.180\nBut I don't wanna be awake\nat midnight to do it so\n\n468\n00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.490\nI'm gonna need to write\na script to do that.\n\n469\n00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.240\nAnd I can do that with\ncommand line utilities.\n\n470\n00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.980\nI can't do that with\na graphical user interface.\n\n471\n00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.040\nI guess maybe I could use the automator\nand kind of work things out there.\n\n472\n00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.580\nHere I've just got\nthe command line utilities.\n\n473\n00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.010\nI can knock it out and it's done.\n\n474\n00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.450\nSo it makes it kind of easy.\n\n475\n00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.536\n>> Is that until you learned this you\nwere coming to work all bleary eyed.\n\n476\n00:23:31.536 --> 00:23:33.626\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Coffee.\n\n477\n00:23:33.626 --> 00:23:35.950\n>> I dread, who are they\nstaffing at three a m on Sunday?\n\n478\n00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:36.840\nGreat.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n479\n00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.400\n>> Here we go.\n\n480\n00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.820\n>> So some things you can automate and\nsome things not so much.\n\n481\n00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.539\nAll right so,\nwhere does all this come in handy?\n\n482\n00:23:44.539 --> 00:23:48.229\nWell we can change permissions on files,\nwe can change permissions on folders,\n\n483\n00:23:48.229 --> 00:23:50.694\nwe can add these attributes,\nwe can add metadata.\n\n484\n00:23:50.694 --> 00:23:53.420\nShoot, before I move in point,\nI almost forgot this.\n\n485\n00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.139\nThis is something that\ncan turn up on the lab.\n\n486\n00:23:55.139 --> 00:23:56.509\nI mean on the exam.\n\n487\n00:23:56.509 --> 00:24:00.083\nThe metadata,\nthe metadata stored inside of the file and\n\n488\n00:24:00.083 --> 00:24:03.770\nit's done in a very\nApple-special kind of way.\n\n489\n00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:06.660\nIt's done in an Apple kind of\nspecial way that's made possible\n\n490\n00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.760\nthanks to the OS X extended\njournaled format file system.\n\n491\n00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.260\nAll right?\n\n492\n00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.659\nSo if your file system is OS X extended\njournaled, you support all this metadata,\n\n493\n00:24:15.659 --> 00:24:20.460\nall these extra attributes, but\nwhat if you're not using that file system?\n\n494\n00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.450\nWhat if you're using\na different file system, right?\n\n495\n00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:23.970\nLike let's take my USB key here.\n\n496\n00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.470\nAnd I wanna show you guys this,\ncuz it can turn up as an exam but\n\n497\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.710\nit also turns up in real life.\n\n498\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.043\nI've bumped into this before.\n\n499\n00:24:29.043 --> 00:24:31.800\nSo, I've got a little USB key\nattached to my system, and\n\n500\n00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.419\nI'm gonna format it real quick.\n\n501\n00:24:33.419 --> 00:24:40.000\nAnd right now my USB key is\nformatted as OS X Extended, right?\n\n502\n00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.310\nSo, if I copy that file over,\nthe metadata's gonna work.\n\n503\n00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.660\nIt's gonna be just fine, right?\n\n504\n00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.340\nSo let's run through that and\nverify I'm not lying to you guys.\n\n505\n00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:51.020\nSo I'm gonna take the employee handbook,\nI'm gonna drop it in my thumb drive, and\n\n506\n00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.900\nwhen I open my thumb drive, there it is.\n\n507\n00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.260\nSo there is the EmployeeHandbook.\n\n508\n00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.890\nIt still got the red dot, right?\n\n509\n00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.865\nAnd if I go into my terminal, and\n\n510\n00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:05.168\nI jump into Volumes into my Thumb\\Drive,\n\n511\n00:25:05.168 --> 00:25:10.230\nand I do an ls, or ls -lae@, okay?\n\n512\n00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:15.150\nI can see right in here that it\nbrought along all the metadata.\n\n513\n00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.925\nAnd I'm talking about permissions,\n\n514\n00:25:16.925 --> 00:25:20.765\nas well as the other attributes that\nare a part of the finder, right?\n\n515\n00:25:20.765 --> 00:25:21.715\nSo it brought all that over.\n\n516\n00:25:21.715 --> 00:25:22.475\nEverything worked great.\n\n517\n00:25:22.475 --> 00:25:24.475\nRight?\nIt all followed the file.\n\n518\n00:25:24.475 --> 00:25:27.585\nWell, now I'm gonna format that drive.\n\n519\n00:25:27.585 --> 00:25:28.495\nOkay?\n\n520\n00:25:28.495 --> 00:25:30.325\nAnd so when I format it,\n\n521\n00:25:30.325 --> 00:25:35.770\nlet's just get that out of the way, I'll\ntake that USB key and we will erase it.\n\n522\n00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:39.577\nExcept this time I'm\ngonna format it as ExFAT.\n\n523\n00:25:39.577 --> 00:25:42.606\nMaybe I got a call from somebody over\nin accounting and they said, hey,\n\n524\n00:25:42.606 --> 00:25:44.285\nI need a copy of the employee handbook.\n\n525\n00:25:44.285 --> 00:25:45.510\nCan you send it to me?\n\n526\n00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.662\nAnd I got a Windows machine.\n\n527\n00:25:47.662 --> 00:25:48.280\nGreat, all right.\n\n528\n00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.968\nI want to send them a USB key but I can't\ndo it OS X Extended Journal because\n\n529\n00:25:50.968 --> 00:25:53.915\nthey're not gonna be able to read that so\nlet me format this ExFAT so they will.\n\n530\n00:25:53.915 --> 00:25:55.840\nAll right, so we'll erase that.\n\n531\n00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.311\nAnd once it's erased,\nI'm gonna copy that handbook over to it.\n\n532\n00:25:58.311 --> 00:26:00.319\nNow Microsoft, who created exFAT,\n\n533\n00:26:00.319 --> 00:26:05.050\nthey don't know anything about Apple's\nattributes at, that's not entirely true,\n\n534\n00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.050\nthey know about them,\nthey just don't care, right?\n\n535\n00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:09.780\nThey don't care about Apple's attributes.\n\n536\n00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.890\nSo they didn't make their file\nsystem able to handle that, right?\n\n537\n00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.330\nIn much the same way that Apple didn't\nmake their file system able to handle\n\n538\n00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.360\nthe Windows files.\n\n539\n00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:23.800\nAnd so when I copy this file over, that\nUSB thumb drive is now a different format.\n\n540\n00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:28.870\nAnd so when I copy it over to it,\nwhat's gonna happen to the metadata?\n\n541\n00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.650\nWell, it copied over,\nand there's my red dot.\n\n542\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.360\nIt's amazing, my red dot is there, okay?\n\n543\n00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.230\nHow did that happen?\n\n544\n00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.620\nexFAT doesn't recognize that.\n\n545\n00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.100\nThe metadata should be gone,\nhow did that happen?\n\n546\n00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.920\nWell, what happens is\nApple has a technology,\n\n547\n00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.530\nit's actually, it sounds spacey but\n\n548\n00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:49.070\nit really isn't, where they can support\nany file system with the attributes.\n\n549\n00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.190\nAnd the way they do it is when they see\nthat you're going to a file system that\n\n550\n00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.710\ndoesn't support the file attributes,\n\n551\n00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.160\nit breaks the attributes out\ninto a separate hidden file.\n\n552\n00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:02.020\nSo there'll actually be two files here,\none that's the file itself and\n\n553\n00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:06.590\none that's storing the attributes that\nwe can't see, it's hidden from the UI.\n\n554\n00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.080\nWell, it's hidden here.\n\n555\n00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.040\nOn a Windows machine you'll see it, and\nso this is why I bring it up cuz your\n\n556\n00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.040\nend users might see it and\nask questions about it.\n\n557\n00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.540\nWhat are all these extra files?\n\n558\n00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:18.010\nAnd it can be a little annoying sometimes\nbut you just ignore them and that's it.\n\n559\n00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:22.363\nBut if I go and take a look, I'm gonna\nget into my volumes and my thumb drive\n\n560\n00:27:22.363 --> 00:27:26.735\nwhich got truncated because you can't\nhave a file name that long I guess.\n\n561\n00:27:26.735 --> 00:27:29.187\nAnd I take a look,\nthere's my employee handbook.\n\n562\n00:27:29.187 --> 00:27:34.442\nAnd if I do an ls-lae@ and\nI take a look at what's going on in there,\n\n563\n00:27:34.442 --> 00:27:37.090\nI'm gonna see a lot of stuff.\n\n564\n00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:37.658\nRight?\n\n565\n00:27:37.658 --> 00:27:39.760\nHere's my EmployeeHandbook and\n\n566\n00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.150\nlooking over here I can see\nthe permissions came across.\n\n567\n00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.210\nSo it's got its metadata but\n\n568\n00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.770\nthe permissions didn't really come across,\ndid they?\n\n569\n00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:51.420\nAnd that's because removal media's\na little bit weird in how it's treated.\n\n570\n00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.440\nAnd this file ended up with full and\ntotal access for everyone,\n\n571\n00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.640\ncompletely unfiltered.\n\n572\n00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.340\nAll right.\n\n573\n00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.710\nWhy is that?\n\n574\n00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:00.780\nWell, exFAT doesn't support permissions.\n\n575\n00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.660\nThere are no permissions in exFAT.\n\n576\n00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.210\nAnd so once the file is on there,\nwe cannot enforce read only, or write,\n\n577\n00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.060\nor execute.\n\n578\n00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.315\nAnd so\nit just shows up as us having everything.\n\n579\n00:28:10.315 --> 00:28:13.240\nExFAT doesn't support permissions,\nso we lost the permissions.\n\n580\n00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.310\nAll right, and now just everybody has all\naccess to it, but the metadata's there.\n\n581\n00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.670\nThere's my FinderComment, my UserTags.\n\n582\n00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.410\nWe still know it's got the red dot.\n\n583\n00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:25.880\nHow do those come across,\nif exFAT doesn't support those either?\n\n584\n00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.637\nWell, notice how I've got\nEmployeeHandbook.pdf.\n\n585\n00:28:28.637 --> 00:28:33.453\nAnd I’ve got ._EmployeeHandbook.pdf.\n\n586\n00:28:33.453 --> 00:28:36.897\nThat file right there is really small,\nit's 4K in size,\n\n587\n00:28:36.897 --> 00:28:40.550\nthat extra file is where\nall that metadata stored.\n\n588\n00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:42.268\nAnd on a Windows machine\nit just ignores it.\n\n589\n00:28:42.268 --> 00:28:44.627\nOn a Windows machine,\nit'll open the EmpleyeeHandbook.pdf and\n\n590\n00:28:44.627 --> 00:28:45.900\neverything'll work like normal.\n\n591\n00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.490\nThere’s no crazy attributes in that,\nthat's the end to that story.\n\n592\n00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:49.550\nRight?\n\n593\n00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:52.070\nBut on a Mac, it'll open it.\n\n594\n00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:56.050\nIt'll see the handbook, and\nit'll see the metadata file and\n\n595\n00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:58.370\nit'll load the information from there.\n\n596\n00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.340\nAnd you'll have everything you need.\n\n597\n00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.050\nIt's all right there kinda packaged part\nand parcel right alongside the file.\n\n598\n00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:05.200\nSo pretty cool that we can get to that.\n\n599\n00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.900\nIt's all right and\nApple kinda thought of that extra,\n\n600\n00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.170\nwhat if our file system\ndoesn't support it?\n\n601\n00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.580\n>> Yeah, it's really smart of them.\n\n602\n00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:14.390\nLike they say, hey, exFat,\nit's meant to cross those platforms.\n\n603\n00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.940\nWhy lose all the cool features that we've\nbuilt into our own operating system\n\n604\n00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.700\njust because you wanna\nplay nice with Windows?\n\n605\n00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.917\nObviously, there's a little\ntension between the two.\n\n606\n00:29:20.917 --> 00:29:24.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They try to work together but\n\n607\n00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.440\nit's like a Middle Eastern\nconference on peace or something.\n\n608\n00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Everybody's there and\n\n609\n00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.345\nshaking hands, but-\n>> Nothing ever gets done?\n\n610\n00:29:32.345 --> 00:29:33.960\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n611\n00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.667\n>> So anyhow, so that's in up on that, and\n\n612\n00:29:35.667 --> 00:29:39.110\nI just wanted to point that out because\nit is something interesting you'll see.\n\n613\n00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.070\nAnd where I normally hear about her\nfrom users is let's say you're using\n\n614\n00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.350\na cloud backup service like Dropbox,\nand so you just put 100 files in and\n\n615\n00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.410\nDropbox says you just synced 200 files.\n\n616\n00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:52.190\n200 files, I just sent 100 files,\nwhat's up?\n\n617\n00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.540\nWell, it's each file and\nits accompanying metadata.\n\n618\n00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.305\nAnd so\nyou go into your Dropbox cloud account and\n\n619\n00:29:57.305 --> 00:29:59.791\nyou've got twice as many files as\nyou thought, and that happens.\n\n620\n00:29:59.791 --> 00:30:05.285\nIt can be pretty exorbitant\nsometimes as there's a ton of files.\n\n621\n00:30:05.285 --> 00:30:06.014\nAll right.\n\n622\n00:30:06.014 --> 00:30:08.105\nDaniel, the next thing\nthat I wanted to look at,\n\n623\n00:30:08.105 --> 00:30:11.063\nI wanted to talk about the default\npermissions of the user profile and\n\n624\n00:30:11.063 --> 00:30:14.240\nthe shared folder which we really\nhaven't looked at in this show.\n\n625\n00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.590\nAnd I know I still haven't really got into\nremoval of media and fixing permission.\n\n626\n00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.460\nSo, I still have a lot to talk about.\n\n627\n00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.080\n>> Yeah.\n>> And I'm kind of short on time.\n\n628\n00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.370\nSo we might need to go to\nthe dreaded part three.\n\n629\n00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.090\n>> That's right.\n>> The trilogy of permissions.\n\n630\n00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:26.070\n>> I'm winning the pool.\n\n631\n00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.725\nI'm winning the pool.\n\n632\n00:30:26.725 --> 00:30:28.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I knew this was gonna happen.\n\n633\n00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:31.570\nJust when you thought it was safe\nto go back into permissions,\n\n634\n00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.675\nDon Pezet is your host.\n\n635\n00:30:32.675 --> 00:30:34.630\n[LAUGH] All right, well it will be fun.\n\n636\n00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.050\nWe've got a lot of stuff to go over, and\n\n637\n00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.180\nstuff you definitely need to know\nthat applies to you in real life.\n\n638\n00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:43.100\nAnd learning this is gonna enrich your\nexperience in using the operating system.\n\n639\n00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.320\nSo we look forward to it.\n\n640\n00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.490\nThanks again for stopping by, Don,\nand showing us what you have so far,\n\n641\n00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.540\nwe look forward to part three.\n\n642\n00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.850\nThat's right, the reckoning-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n643\n00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.080\n>> Of file permissions.\n\n644\n00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.940\nHopefully, we'll see\nyou guys there as well.\n\n645\n00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.900\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n646\n00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:57.510\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n647\n00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.611\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n648\n00:30:58.611 --> 00:31:04.877\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

They look at default folders in the Home directory, like the Public folder which is used for sharing data with other users. They also look at the Shared folder which performs similarly to the Public folder. They also show you how to retain file permissions and protect against deletion by setting the \"sticky bit\". And finally they show you how to repair permissions that have be damaged as well as working with the file systems on removable media.",

another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:19.880\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are continuing on with\n\n5\n00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.570\nour Apple Certified Support Professional\nseries.\n\n6\n00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.240\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto help us out with a little bit more on\n\n7\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.550\nthe file permissions, none other\nthan our good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.940\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.840\n>> Thanks for having me back, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.920\nReady to jump right back into part three.\n\n11\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.280\nWe're gonna complete\nthe permissions trilogy today,\n\n12\n00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.330\nand-\n>> That's right.\n\n13\n00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.140\n>> In the first two episodes,\nthe very first one,\n\n14\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.290\nwe kind of looked at permissions\nin the graphical user interface.\n\n15\n00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.980\nIn the second episode we really did\ncommand line and changing those.\n\n16\n00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.200\nIn this episode we're gonna step\naway from both of those, and\n\n17\n00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.150\nwe're gonna take a look at some of the\npermissions that are already applied to\n\n18\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.560\nfiles in OS 10 and how they impact\nthe way that we use the system.\n\n19\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.250\nSo just kind of seeing a more\npractical application of these.\n\n20\n00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.550\nAnd where I wanna start today\nis the user home folder.\n\n21\n00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.870\nWhen you have a home folder,\nit's got a lot of stuff inside of there,\n\n22\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.790\nyour documents folder,\nyour desktop and so on.\n\n23\n00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.400\nEach one of those has a default set of\npermissions that you need to be familiar\n\n24\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.520\nwith for the exam,\nespecially in the few instances where it's\n\n25\n00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.250\na little bit different and\na little more weird.\n\n26\n00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.380\nSo let's talk about that, and\n\n27\n00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.880\nthen we'll move to some other fancy\nstuff toward the end of the episode.\n\n28\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.640\nBut we should be able to\nwrap this one up this time.\n\n29\n00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.415\n>> We'll there be ewoks stunt?\n\n30\n00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:20.320\n[LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna have\n\n31\n00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.090\nthat little jub jub song at the end.\n\n32\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.070\n>> Yes, that will awesome.\n\n33\n00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.740\n>> It'll be great.\n\n34\n00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.265\nAll right.\n\n35\n00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:26.804\nWell, let's take a look\nat a users home folder.\n\n36\n00:01:26.804 --> 00:01:29.829\nSo, for me, let me just go to\nmy home folder real quick.\n\n37\n00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.017\nAnd I'm just gonna use the finders\ngo menu and choose home.\n\n38\n00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:36.251\nAnd this is what we expect to see for\na default user, right?\n\n39\n00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:40.140\nYou've got desktop, documents, downloads,\nmovies, music, pictures, public.\n\n40\n00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.650\nMaybe applications,\nmay or may not show up.\n\n41\n00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.910\nThere's actually other one's that\nare hidden that we can't see like library,\n\n42\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.730\nthat the UI is hiding for\nme, but it is there.\n\n43\n00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.670\nWhen you create a new user account,\nthe user account gets a home folder.\n\n44\n00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.610\nAnd their home folder\nhas this files in it.\n\n45\n00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.160\nAnd, for the most part,\nthe permission to set a particular way.\n\n46\n00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.913\nFor example, it's set so that you, as\nthat user, so, I'm logged in as D Pezet.\n\n47\n00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:04.370\nThis is D Pezet's home.\n\n48\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.080\nI have read and write to all these stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.120\nSo, I can read and\nwrite to everyone in these folders.\n\n50\n00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.450\nI have the access cuz it's my folder.\n\n51\n00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.170\nBut most of the other folders,\nusers don't have access to, right?\n\n52\n00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.200\nWe don't want them getting in and\ngaining access to my data,\n\n53\n00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.920\nwith certain exceptions.\n\n54\n00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.810\nSpecifically, this public\nfolder right here.\n\n55\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.340\nThe public folder designed for when I\nwant to share something with other users.\n\n56\n00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.822\nAnd so, its got different permissions.\n\n57\n00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:33.430\nWe're gonna allow people\nto read from that folder\n\n58\n00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.170\ncuz we want them to be able to\nget at it and see that data.\n\n59\n00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.490\nSo let's take a look at\nthis from the command line.\n\n60\n00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.370\nAnd we'll see kind of how\nthose permissions are setup.\n\n61\n00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.190\nSo, right now I am in my home folder.\n\n62\n00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.709\nSo, I'm in /Users/dpezet.\n\n63\n00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.165\nAnd that's where the home folders are,\nright?\n\n64\n00:02:48.165 --> 00:02:51.871\n/Users/ whatever\nthe username happens to be.\n\n65\n00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:57.430\nAnd if I do a ls-l, I can see all\nthe files that are inside of it.\n\n66\n00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.476\nI see Desktop, Documents,\nDownloads, Library, Movies, Music,\n\n67\n00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:04.208\nPictures, Public., I don't have any\nApplications and Library though showed up.\n\n68\n00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:07.648\nEven though it's hidden from\nthe I see it in the command line.\n\n69\n00:03:07.648 --> 00:03:08.580\nAnd if I come over here and\n\n70\n00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.700\nlook at the permissions,\nlook at the permissions assigned to these.\n\n71\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.080\nMost of them are, well, d for\na directory cuz that's what they are.\n\n72\n00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.730\nThe owner, me, I get read, write, execute.\n\n73\n00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.750\nI get full access to all of these folders.\n\n74\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.620\nBut the group gets nothing.\n\n75\n00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.730\nSo staff, staff is every\nother user on this computer.\n\n76\n00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.920\nThey get nothing.\n\n77\n00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.510\nAnd then everyone, that would be,\nwell, everyone else.\n\n78\n00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.500\nThey get nothing.\n\n79\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.610\nSo, only I have access to these files.\n\n80\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.960\nWell, except for this guy down\nhere at the bottom, all right?\n\n81\n00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.870\nThat's that public folder.\n\n82\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.840\nI have rewrite and execute.\n\n83\n00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.830\nBut the group, which is everybody else\nwith a user account on my computer,\n\n84\n00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.860\nthey get read and execute.\n\n85\n00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.390\nAnd r-x here for everyone,\nthat means everyone,\n\n86\n00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.680\neven the guest account, gets read and\nexecute on that folder.\n\n87\n00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.740\nThey can't change anything.\n\n88\n00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.470\nThey can't delete anything.\n\n89\n00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.280\nBut they can browse in there and\naccess it.\n\n90\n00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.220\nSo, if I have a file and\nI want Daniel to be able to get to it,\n\n91\n00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.950\nI can just throw it right there in\npublic and now he can get to it.\n\n92\n00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.560\nI can still change it, but he can read it.\n\n93\n00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.010\nI don't have to mess with permissions\nat all, it's already done for me.\n\n94\n00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.300\nI can make my own folder,\nI can set these permissions or\n\n95\n00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.480\nI can just use what\nApple's already given me.\n\n96\n00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.230\nNow, here's one little\ntricky part about this.\n\n97\n00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.158\nIf I want Daniel to get\nto my public folder,\n\n98\n00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:22.120\nhe's got permissions,\nhe can get to it, right?\n\n99\n00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.340\nNot exactly.\n\n100\n00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.280\nHe's got to browse to it to get to it.\n\n101\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.800\nAnd in order to browse to it, he's got to\npass through my home folder to get there.\n\n102\n00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.680\nSo, if we take a look at the home folder\npermissions, this is where things get\n\n103\n00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.077\na little weird and don't necessarily\nwork the way that we think.\n\n104\n00:04:35.077 --> 00:04:35.746\nSo, whoops.\n\n105\n00:04:35.746 --> 00:04:38.910\nWhat?\n[SOUND] [LAUGH] I've lost control.\n\n106\n00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.945\n>> It does get weird here.\n\n107\n00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:41.180\n[LAUGH]\n>> It certainly does.\n\n108\n00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.920\nSo, if you look,\nI'm in the slash users folder, okay?\n\n109\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.245\nAnd the slash users folder,\nthat's where all the home folders are.\n\n110\n00:04:48.245 --> 00:04:52.960\nAnd s,o if I do an ls-la what I'm going\nto see in here are each of the users.\n\n111\n00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.880\nSo, you get dpezet.\n\n112\n00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.670\nThat's me.\n\n113\n00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.570\nAnd, there's daniellowrie.\n\n114\n00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.555\nI made an account for\nhim in one of the other shows.\n\n115\n00:04:57.555 --> 00:04:59.500\nSo, he's got an account,\nI've got an account.\n\n116\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.890\nAnd if you look,\nwe each own our respective home folders.\n\n117\n00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:03.720\nHe's the owner of his.\n\n118\n00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.900\nI'm the owner of mine.\n\n119\n00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.940\nBut look at these permissions.\n\n120\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.990\nWe, as the owners get read,\nwrite, and execute.\n\n121\n00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.380\nBut then, everyone gets read and\nexecute on our home folder.\n\n122\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.950\nWhat's that about?\n\n123\n00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.840\nDaniel could browse into my Home\nfolder and I could browse into his.\n\n124\n00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.580\nIt's not private at all, is it?\n\n125\n00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.432\n>> I hate to tell you, I already have.\n\n126\n00:05:22.432 --> 00:05:22.991\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I found those files, Don.\n\n127\n00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:24.525\n[LAUGH]\n>> I've already copied all the data\n\n128\n00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:25.110\nout of there.\n\n129\n00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.590\nWell, they can get into your home folder,\nbut that's it.\n\n130\n00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.910\nThey can't get into the subfolders,\nexcept for public, right?\n\n131\n00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.380\nAnd they have this permission\nhere in your Home folder just so\n\n132\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.990\nthey can get to public.\n\n133\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.280\nThey can browse through and\nfind it and get to it, all right?\n\n134\n00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.600\nBut the key takeaway here is, remember,\nthat your Home folder is not private.\n\n135\n00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.470\nAnybody else with a user account on\nthe system, including guests, right,\n\n136\n00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.940\nbecause they fall under everyone,\ncan browse in your Home folder.\n\n137\n00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.600\nAnd what are they gonna see?\n\n138\n00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.040\nThey're gonna see a list\nof the subfolders.\n\n139\n00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.200\nBut if you're one of those people,\nI know some people who do this.\n\n140\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.390\nThey say, hey, I'm gonna make a document,\nso I fire up text edit and\n\n141\n00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.860\nI start to make a,\nthis is an important document, right?\n\n142\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.200\nSo, I'm making a super sweet document.\n\n143\n00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.440\nThis is gonna be the best.\n\n144\n00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.995\nAnd I make this document, and I go to\nsave it and ask where I want to put it.\n\n145\n00:06:12.995 --> 00:06:15.290\nWell, it defaults to going into Documents.\n\n146\n00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.290\nOnly I have access to my documents folder.\n\n147\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.570\nBut what if I say, you know what,\nI'm gonna put this in my home folder?\n\n148\n00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.270\nSee how Apple doesn't show that\nas one of my options by default?\n\n149\n00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.190\nCuz they don't want you to put it\n\n150\n00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.280\nin your home folder because\nother people can get at it.\n\n151\n00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.750\nYou might as well put it in\npublic at that point, right?\n\n152\n00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.340\nBut there's nothing stopping you\nfrom going to Macintosh HD and\n\n153\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.650\nbrowsing from there, and going into users,\nand going in your home folder and\n\n154\n00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.342\nsticking it right in your home folder,\nwhich I just did.\n\n155\n00:06:42.342 --> 00:06:42.970\nAll right?\n\n156\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.575\nNow that it's in my home folder,\nwhat are the permissions going to be?\n\n157\n00:06:46.575 --> 00:06:53.770\nWell, if we take a look at that,\nif I get in to my home folder and I pull\n\n158\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.370\nup a listing, there's that Untitled.rtf\nfile right there at the bottom.\n\n159\n00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:04.010\nAnd if I look at its permissions,\nI have read-write, everyone else has read.\n\n160\n00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.130\nAnybody on my computer or a guest,\ncan browse and read that file.\n\n161\n00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.920\nSo the moral of the story is,\ndon't put files in your home directory,\n\n162\n00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.540\ncuz they're not private.\n\n163\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.920\nThey need to go in your subfolders.\n\n164\n00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.310\nThe subfolders are private,\nthat's where your stuff should go.\n\n165\n00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.930\nThat's why you have a Documents folder or\nDesktops or whatever.\n\n166\n00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.126\nThose are all private.\n\n167\n00:07:20.126 --> 00:07:20.850\nAll right?\n\n168\n00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.740\nThe Public folder we expect to be public,\nand it is.\n\n169\n00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.750\nAnd so, I could throw this\nin the Public folder, too.\n\n170\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.780\nAnd that would make it available\nto the other people, too.\n\n171\n00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.501\nThat’s usually what want.\n\n172\n00:07:28.501 --> 00:07:29.900\nAll right?\n\n173\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.080\nThere’s one more folder point\nout while I'm in here, and\n\n174\n00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.220\nthat's the Drop box folder.\n\n175\n00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.260\nAnd I think I talked about\nit in another episode.\n\n176\n00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.330\nBut if I go into my Public folder,\nand I pull up\n\n177\n00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.270\na directory listing in there, there's a\nfolder created by default called Drop Box.\n\n178\n00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:53.661\nAnd if you look at the permissions,\nas the owner I have read, write, execute.\n\n179\n00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:58.503\nThe group has just write and execute,\nand everyone else has write and\n\n180\n00:07:58.503 --> 00:08:03.444\nexecute, they don't have read Okay,\nwell why do they have execute?\n\n181\n00:08:03.444 --> 00:08:05.465\nIt's a folder,\nthey've got to be able to browse into it,\n\n182\n00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:06.800\nyou execute the folder to get into it.\n\n183\n00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.560\nThat's why they have that permission but\nthen they only have write.\n\n184\n00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:15.620\nThey can write files into the folder and\nnobody can read them except for me.\n\n185\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.220\nSo once it's in there it disappears and\nnow I have access to it and that's it.\n\n186\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.440\nThey can't read even their own\ndocuments better yet somebody else's.\n\n187\n00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.780\nOnly I can.\n\n188\n00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.280\nSo it's got special permissions\non that Drop Box folder,\n\n189\n00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.050\nthat's what it's made for.\n\n190\n00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.650\nIf you don't like that\nyou can get rid of it.\n\n191\n00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.120\nYou can change it's permissions, but these\nare the defaults that are assigned to it\n\n192\n00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.330\nthat you'll need to know for the exam.\n\n193\n00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.070\nAll right, now I said if I wanted\nto share something with Daniel I\n\n194\n00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.790\ncould put it in my public folder, he\ncould browse and he could find it, okay?\n\n195\n00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.710\nThere is another place\nthat we could put things.\n\n196\n00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.870\nLet's say there's\ndocuments that Daniel and\n\n197\n00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.510\nI are gonna be working on\ntogether all the time.\n\n198\n00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.760\nAnd we might even be adding other\nemployees later that I want them to\n\n199\n00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.880\naccess, too.\n\n200\n00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.920\nWell, there's another folder called\nthe Shared folder that facilitates that.\n\n201\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.900\nAnd you might have noticed it.\n\n202\n00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.800\nLet me get back into the Users folder.\n\n203\n00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.590\nSo, I'm in the /Users folder.\n\n204\n00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.710\nAnd when I pulled up my listing,\nYou'll see where I have daniellowrie,\n\n205\n00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.970\ndpezet and Shared.\n\n206\n00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:09.830\nI didn't make that.\n\n207\n00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.750\nThat's part of OS 10.\n\n208\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.510\nIt has the Shared folder and\n\n209\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.860\nanything that goes in there, all of your\nusers will be able to see and work with.\n\n210\n00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.510\nIf you look at the permission,\nsee how everybody has full control?\n\n211\n00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:25.250\nSo if I go into that Shared folder,\nit's kinda empty isn't it?\n\n212\n00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.820\nWhat is that, SC Info,\nI don't even know what that is.\n\n213\n00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.597\nSo let's [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:09:28.597 --> 00:09:29.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's go and\n\n215\n00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.530\nthrow in my employee handbook.\n\n216\n00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.650\nSo we'll just create a new\ndocument in there, right?\n\n217\n00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:40.200\nSo if I browse into that shared folder I\ncan jump in there and create a document.\n\n218\n00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.629\nSo I'm just gonna make a new document.\n\n219\n00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.220\nActually here, let me do a good,\nold text edit.\n\n220\n00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:50.790\nSo this is an important document,\nas all of my documents are these days.\n\n221\n00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.540\n>> Changed my life.\n\n222\n00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.820\n>> I know, it's so special.\n\n223\n00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.870\nI'm gonna go and drop that into that\nshared folder and I'll save it.\n\n224\n00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.780\nAnd I just left it called untitled because\napparently that's the kind of worker I am.\n\n225\n00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.830\nAnd so I'm going to take a look at it and\nthere's that Untitled.rtf, and so\n\n226\n00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:10.365\nif I look at it, I can see on\nUntitled.rtf and look at the permissions.\n\n227\n00:10:10.365 --> 00:10:13.830\nI have read write because I made it and\neveryone else has read.\n\n228\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.080\nIt's a shared folder.\n\n229\n00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.350\nOther people can get at it and\nthey can read it.\n\n230\n00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.610\nNow, he can't write to it.\n\n231\n00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.080\nHe can't delete it.\n\n232\n00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.030\nNow why is that?\n\n233\n00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.130\nNormally when you create a new file\nit inherits the permissions of\n\n234\n00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:28.710\nthe folder that it's in.\n\n235\n00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.710\nAnd on the folder,\neverybody had read, write, execute.\n\n236\n00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.990\nSo normally when you put a file inside\nof a folder that's marked as read,\n\n237\n00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:40.370\nwrite, execute for everybody the file will\nbe read, write, execute for everybody.\n\n238\n00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.000\nBut that's not what happened here.\n\n239\n00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.340\nWhen I created the file it ended up with\ndifferent permissions than the folder.\n\n240\n00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.000\nSo the folder has read,\nwrite, execute, and\n\n241\n00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.300\neven some of these other files that\nare in there have read, write, execute.\n\n242\n00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.120\nBut the one I just made does not, right?\n\n243\n00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.970\nAnd the reason is, this folder, it uses\na technology called the sticky bit.\n\n244\n00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.880\nAnd the sticky bit is kind of\na weird little exception to how\n\n245\n00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.470\npermissions normally work.\n\n246\n00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.150\nWhen you create a file,\n\n247\n00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.880\nthe file by default will inherit\nthe permissions of its folder.\n\n248\n00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.094\nThat's what normally happens.\n\n249\n00:11:11.094 --> 00:11:15.210\nBut, when implement the sticky bit,\nit says, yeah go ahead and\n\n250\n00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:19.940\ninherit the permissions of\nthe parent folder, but make sure\n\n251\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.620\nthat nobody can delete the file other\nthan the person who created it.\n\n252\n00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:29.200\nSo even though it's a shared folder,\nI don't want Daniel to delete my files.\n\n253\n00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.490\nI just want him to have access, right?\n\n254\n00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.320\nAnd he probably doesn't want\nme to delete his files.\n\n255\n00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.710\nAnd we can do that with\nour own home folders.\n\n256\n00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.700\nBut if I have a community folder\nlike this one it's kind of hard.\n\n257\n00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.440\nThe sticky bit makes that possible.\n\n258\n00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.040\nAll right,\nnow normally we don't care about it.\n\n259\n00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.340\nThis is just some magical behavior of\nthe shared folder and that's how it is.\n\n260\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.310\nBut if you ever need to know how it\nactually works, you can see the sticky\n\n261\n00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.960\nbit, let me get back into\nthe user's folder and do an ls-la.\n\n262\n00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.230\nYou can always spot the sticky bit\nbecause it's the exception to the rule.\n\n263\n00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.960\nWe see here everyone doesn't\nhave re-write execute,\n\n264\n00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.790\neveryone has rwt, rewrite And t.\n\n265\n00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:07.780\n>> T [LAUGH].\n\n266\n00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.340\n>> Tango, I don't know what it stands for.\n\n267\n00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.400\nIt's the sticky bit.\n\n268\n00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.220\nIt's saying look if this bit is set,\n\n269\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.170\nwhenever somebody creates a file they're\nthe only ones who can delete it.\n\n270\n00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.220\nIt's stuck to them.\n\n271\n00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.360\nThey're the owner.\n\n272\n00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.240\nThey're the ones who get to do that and\nmess with that file.\n\n273\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.770\nSo, for example here,\n\n274\n00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:30.980\nI'm in the terminal and I'm logged\nin as dpezet so if I do a who am I?\n\n275\n00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.200\nI'm dpezet.\n\n276\n00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.430\nAnd if I get into the shared folder and\n\n277\n00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.450\nI'm gonna create a file\ncalled donsfile.txt.\n\n278\n00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:44.900\nSo I just created that file and if I take\na look at the permissions on that file\n\n279\n00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:51.720\nI can see that I'm the owner, and everyone\nelse just has read permissions on it.\n\n280\n00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.680\nNow, let's say that I'm\nlogged in as Daniel, okay.\n\n281\n00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.540\nSo I'm gonna switch context\nhere into daniellowrie.\n\n282\n00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.810\nThere we go.\n\n283\n00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.650\nSo, now I'm logged in as\nDaniel in this other prompt.\n\n284\n00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.280\nAnd I'm gonna get into\nthe users folder and shared.\n\n285\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.600\nAnd he's gonna create a file\ncalled danielsfile.txt.\n\n286\n00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.010\nI made one called donsfile,\nhe made one called danielsfile.\n\n287\n00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:25.270\nWhen I go back to my context, if I do\nan ls-la and take a look at what we got,\n\n288\n00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.300\nnotice how he's the owner of his file,\nI'm the owner of my file.\n\n289\n00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.850\nThat's a difference between how\nthat would normally behave.\n\n290\n00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.410\nWe're the owner of our own files and\neverybody else can read.\n\n291\n00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.420\nI can't delete his file.\n\n292\n00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.670\nHe can't delete my file.\n\n293\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.880\nThe sticky bit is what made that possible.\n\n294\n00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.230\nAll right, now you can make your own\nfolder like this if you ever want to.\n\n295\n00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.380\nI had doubt it would be on the exam,\nbut if you want.\n\n296\n00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.300\nIn the command line episode last time,\nI showed you chmod and how we can add or\n\n297\n00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.360\nremove permissions.\n\n298\n00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.180\nYou can add or remove the sticky bit if\nyou want to create your own sticky bit\n\n299\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.740\nfolder, it's just plus t\nis the way that you add it.\n\n300\n00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.190\nI've never had a need for it, but\nlet's say you wanna make your own for\n\n301\n00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.220\nwhatever reason, right?\n\n302\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:10.380\nSo let me get into my,\nwe can put it on my desktop.\n\n303\n00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.720\nSo I decide that I wanna create some kind\nof corporate shared documents folder,\n\n304\n00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.330\nso I can create a CorpShare,\nspelled right, there we go.\n\n305\n00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.080\nSo I've created this folder called\nCorpShare and I'm the owner.\n\n306\n00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.150\nI can do whatever I want.\n\n307\n00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.020\nI've got some default\npermissions assigned to it.\n\n308\n00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.370\nThose are in place.\n\n309\n00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:28.510\nBut, I may be sharing this out.\n\n310\n00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.308\nI want other people to get into it and\ndo whatever they want.\n\n311\n00:14:31.308 --> 00:14:35.660\nSo, maybe I change the permissions so\nthat everybody has read and\n\n312\n00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.380\nwrite on CorpShare and\n\n313\n00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:44.090\nmaybe I want to do a -R to make that\nrecursive so it's the whole thing.\n\n314\n00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.210\nNow we get those permissions set so\n\n315\n00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.250\nthat everybody can do whatever they\nwant to that folder and work with it.\n\n316\n00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:53.070\nBut now I want to set that sticky bit, so\nthat we don't get the different behaviors.\n\n317\n00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:59.886\nBecause, right now if I go into CorpShare\nand I create a file called donsfile.txt.\n\n318\n00:14:59.886 --> 00:15:02.520\nAnd I take a look at those permissions.\n\n319\n00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.510\nWell shoot.\n\n320\n00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.430\nIt's in my profile.\n\n321\n00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.480\nSo its gonna give these permissions.\n\n322\n00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.520\nI should've created that\noutside of the profile.\n\n323\n00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.410\n>> Yes.\nIt's gonna behave kinda like stick to that\n\n324\n00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.100\nalready because it's in my profile.\n\n325\n00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.060\nAlthough, your account might be different,\nbut yeah,\n\n326\n00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.020\nI should've created it\noutside of my profile.\n\n327\n00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.590\nBut if I wanna set that sticky bit,\n\n328\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:22.620\nall I have to do is do a little chmod,\nand usually you'll do this recursive,\n\n329\n00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.850\nso it affects the files that are inside\nof it, but you don't have to.\n\n330\n00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.220\nAnd then you can come in and\njust say +t, so I'm adding the t bit,\n\n331\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:34.130\nand then I'm going to do that to my\nCorpShare folder and get that set.\n\n332\n00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.610\nWhen I take a look at the permissions now,\nthere's that T.\n\n333\n00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.000\nA letter T shows up and we're in business.\n\n334\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.020\nSo, we've modified that permission and\nwe got it put in place.\n\n335\n00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.610\n>> And now, we can keep it safe.\n\n336\n00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.050\nNo one can mess around with it.\n\n337\n00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.050\nThat's really the whole purpose of that.\n\n338\n00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.205\nNow, when we talk about permissions Don,\nIt happens and\n\n339\n00:15:50.205 --> 00:15:53.491\nwe all probably hate to admit it but\nnone of us are perfect and\n\n340\n00:15:53.491 --> 00:15:56.010\nI'm sure you have done\nthis plenty of times.\n\n341\n00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:01.099\nYou're kicking your feet around inside\nthe command line and You start messing\n\n342\n00:16:01.099 --> 00:16:05.740\nup permissions and things get jacked up,\nand what can we do to fix that?\n\n343\n00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.133\nCuz that's really what we wanna know.\n\n344\n00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:10.020\n[LAUGH]\n>> You can mess your permissions up\n\n345\n00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:10.610\npretty well.\n\n346\n00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.560\nIt certainly can happen, and you can get\nit where you can't login with your user\n\n347\n00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.850\nany more, and if you have another user,\nthat's great.\n\n348\n00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:16.960\nYou just login as them and you fix it.\n\n349\n00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.200\nBut maybe you don't have\nanother administrator, and\n\n350\n00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.580\nyour permissions are really\nsuper mega hosed.\n\n351\n00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.010\nYou can fix it, right?\n\n352\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.820\nThe disk utility actually has the feature\nbuilt in where it can repair permissions.\n\n353\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.680\nAnd in previous versions of OS X, it\nactually had its dedicated button where it\n\n354\n00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.110\nwould say verify permissions,\nrepair permissions.\n\n355\n00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.440\nNow it's all rolled up into the first\naid package in the disk utility.\n\n356\n00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.580\nSo, if you've messed up permissions,\nthere's two ways to go about fixing it.\n\n357\n00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.720\nSo, the first way is just\nto use Disk Utility, right.\n\n358\n00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.500\nSo if I fire up my system and\nI'm able to log in, and I can get in and\n\n359\n00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.837\nstart to work with it.\n\n360\n00:16:49.837 --> 00:16:53.465\nI can fire up the Disk Utility,\nI can choose my disk,\n\n361\n00:16:53.465 --> 00:16:57.270\nand then you've got the First Aid\nbutton right there.\n\n362\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.530\nNow First Aid is gonna check for hardware\nerrors, as well as permissions and\n\n363\n00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.070\nrepair those permissions gonna\nput back the way they should be.\n\n364\n00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.450\nSo you get into the system and use it.\n\n365\n00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.620\nBut what if you're completely locked out?\n\n366\n00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.980\nIf you're completely locked out and\n\n367\n00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:14.490\nyou can't even get in there to get to this\nscreen, what's that gonna do for you?\n\n368\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.610\nWell, you can boot to recovery.\n\n369\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.710\nIf you boot to recovery the Disk Utility\nis right there on the main\n\n370\n00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:20.420\nscreen of recovery.\n\n371\n00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.800\nWe can see we've used that\non several episodes now.\n\n372\n00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.200\nAnd so you on on the recovery and\nyou can go in there and\n\n373\n00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.780\nlaunch First Aid right out of Disk Utility\nand it'll fix those permissions again.\n\n374\n00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.770\nIt's gonna put your permissions back\nto the way that they should be.\n\n375\n00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:37.600\nAnother option would be to format and\nrestore from a Time Machine backup and\n\n376\n00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.170\nyour Time Machine backup\nwill put everything back.\n\n377\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.740\nBut if the permissions\nhave been messed up for\n\n378\n00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.960\nawhile your backup might have\nthe messed up permissions.\n\n379\n00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.310\nIt does put them back to the way they are.\n\n380\n00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.260\nSo usually running\nthe First Aid utility inside\n\n381\n00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.910\nof Disk Utility is usually\nthe better route to go.\n\n382\n00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.030\nIf you really know your permissions,\n\n383\n00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.860\nyou could always boot to recovery,\ngo into the terminal and\n\n384\n00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.950\nhave some command line fun and you can\ngo in and repair everything that way.\n\n385\n00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.040\nBut that's usually harder and\n\n386\n00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.650\ntakes longer than just running\nthe First Aid in Disk Utility.\n\n387\n00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.120\nThat's what I normally do,\nI rarely go in and fix them by hand.\n\n388\n00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.500\nSo couple of different ways\nyou can go about that.\n\n389\n00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.430\nIf your system is really super mega hosed,\nmaybe you don't have a recovery, and\n\n390\n00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.850\nyour system can't do Internet recovery for\nsome reason.\n\n391\n00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:17.740\nThe last method for me is boot the system\nholding down the letter T on your\n\n392\n00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.880\nkeyboard so it boots into target mode, and\n\n393\n00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.580\nhook it up as a removable\nhard drive to another system.\n\n394\n00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.100\nThat way you can see the drive,\nscan it, and repair.\n\n395\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.410\nBut that requires you to\nhave two Macs to do it.\n\n396\n00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.902\n>> Yeah, that's a little\nmore of an expensive option.\n\n397\n00:18:29.902 --> 00:18:31.080\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n398\n00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:31.840\n>> For us to repair.\n\n399\n00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.460\nBut you know what?\n\n400\n00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.610\nDepending on the data that's on that\ncomputer, that might be a viable option.\n\n401\n00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.240\nIf you've gotta get that stuff back,\nyou gotta get in that sucker,\n\n402\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.310\nthen you'll go through hell and\nback to get on that computer.\n\n403\n00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.010\nSo, it is an option there.\n\n404\n00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:46.130\n>> Absolutely.\n\n405\n00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.670\nAll right, the last thing I wanna\ntalk about is removable media.\n\n406\n00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.190\nIn, it was either the first or\n\n407\n00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.800\nsecond permissions episode,\nI threw some files on removable media, and\n\n408\n00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.200\nyou guys might have noticed some\nweird behavior with the permissions.\n\n409\n00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.110\nI lost permissions.\n\n410\n00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.540\nRemovable media is special, right?\n\n411\n00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.950\nIt's special for a few reasons.\n\n412\n00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:06.690\nOne, cuz it supports file formats\nother than OS X extended.\n\n413\n00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:11.250\nSo in the earlier episode what I did is I\nhad a USB key and it was formatted exFAT,\n\n414\n00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:15.550\nto be compatible with Windows and Mac,\nand exFAT doesn't support permissions.\n\n415\n00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.830\nSo any file I copy to it is gonna get\nread, write, execute for everybody.\n\n416\n00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.050\nIt has no permissions.\n\n417\n00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.070\nEverybody has wide open,\nfull access to that data.\n\n418\n00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.590\nWe have to make sure that our\ndisk is formatted in a way\n\n419\n00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.030\nthat people will be able to\nhave permissions and access.\n\n420\n00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.500\nIf that's what we want,\nif we wanna restrict that.\n\n421\n00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.160\nBut here's the problem.\n\n422\n00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.660\nI've got for example Daniel.\n\n423\n00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.950\nDaniel has a user account\nhere on my system.\n\n424\n00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.770\nSo I might put a file on\nmy removable media and\n\n425\n00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.460\nI might say that Daniel\nis allowed to access it.\n\n426\n00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.012\nAnd then I take that USB, I unplug it and\nplug it to another computer.\n\n427\n00:19:47.012 --> 00:19:49.540\nWell does Daniel have an account\non the other computer?\n\n428\n00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.470\nMaybe.\n\n429\n00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.950\nEven if he does,\nit's not the same Daniel account.\n\n430\n00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.490\nIt's not the same one as here.\n\n431\n00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.680\nIt might have a different password.\n\n432\n00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.230\nIt might have a different UUID,\nright an identifying number on it.\n\n433\n00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.130\nIt might have some\ndifferent characteristic.\n\n434\n00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.150\nI say might, it's almost a guarantee.\n\n435\n00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.800\nIt's like so\nunusually possible this could happen.\n\n436\n00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.030\nIt's like winning the lottery.\n\n437\n00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.170\nSo the odds are he is not gonna be able\nto access that file on another computer.\n\n438\n00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.600\nSo that breaks things.\n\n439\n00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.870\nAnd so on removable media,\nwe typically don't have permissions.\n\n440\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.100\nWith things like the exFAT format\n\n441\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.380\nyou don't have permissions you can move\nto computer to computer, computer.\n\n442\n00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.709\nYou'll always be able to access that data.\n\n443\n00:20:24.709 --> 00:20:25.951\nBut what if you want it?\n\n444\n00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:27.230\nWhat if you want those permissions?\n\n445\n00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.920\nLike you know what, this is a removable\ndriver, it's gonna be attached to my\n\n446\n00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.980\ncomputer and I don't want somebody just\ntake it and plug it in somewhere else.\n\n447\n00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.380\nWell the short answer is you\nshould encrypt the drive, right?\n\n448\n00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.000\nWhen you format it you can choose to\ndo OS X extended journal encrypted,\n\n449\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.560\nand you can encrypt it.\n\n450\n00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.688\nNow you're safe,\nthat's the best way to go about it.\n\n451\n00:20:44.688 --> 00:20:47.520\nBut you can preserve permissions\nto if you want that.\n\n452\n00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:52.010\nFirst off you need a file system that\nsupports permissions, and then secondly,\n\n453\n00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:57.270\nyou need to change the way that owners\nare handled on a removable media.\n\n454\n00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:01.380\nBy default, OS X ignores\nownership on a removable media.\n\n455\n00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.830\nEven when the format is something\nthat does support permissions.\n\n456\n00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.560\nAnd the reason is they know if you\nmove that key to another computer,\n\n457\n00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.840\nthat USB hard drive to another computer,\nit's not gonna the same owner.\n\n458\n00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.560\nAnd you're not gonna be\nable to access the data.\n\n459\n00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.920\nSo they make it where you can override it,\nand that's the default.\n\n460\n00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:15.840\nLet me show you.\n\n461\n00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:21.050\nI'm gonna take my USB thumb drive, and\nI formatted it exFAT in that other show.\n\n462\n00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.200\nI'm going to format it back\nto OS X Extended (Journaled).\n\n463\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:29.494\nSo, this is my USB thumb drive, and\nI'll make it OS X Extended (Journaled).\n\n464\n00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.420\nAnd we'll stick with the GUID\nPartition Map, it's very exciting, and\n\n465\n00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.390\nwe'll get that in place, all right.\n\n466\n00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.027\nNow once it's formatted I can\nstart copying files to it, and\n\n467\n00:21:39.027 --> 00:21:42.940\nI can start to change their permissions,\nright, just the way I would expect.\n\n468\n00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.440\nSo there, it's done, and let me take\nmy employee handbook file we made on\n\n469\n00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.640\nthe other show, and I'm gonna copy it over\nthere just so I have something in there.\n\n470\n00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.080\nAnd if I take that employee handbook,\nI can pull up it's settings and\n\n471\n00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.680\nactually I've already\ngot some stuff on there.\n\n472\n00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.230\nMarketing, dpezet, staff, everyone.\n\n473\n00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.100\nMaybe I add Daniel to that list.\n\n474\n00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.470\nSo I want to get him and\nthrow him on that disk.\n\n475\n00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.530\nSo there's Daniel,\nmaybe I'll give him read and write.\n\n476\n00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.900\nSo I'm assigning permissions and\n\n477\n00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.060\ngetting this set up exactly\nthe way that I want it, right?\n\n478\n00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.950\nWell, when we unplug this drive and\nwe take it to another computer,\n\n479\n00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.990\nthat all breaks down,\nthose accounts aren't there.\n\n480\n00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.960\nSo what's the other computer gonna do?\n\n481\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.970\nWell it's got two choices.\n\n482\n00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.470\nEither one,\nit just doesn't access the data, and\n\n483\n00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.230\nthat's the end of the story, right?\n\n484\n00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.420\nOr two, it overwrites the permissions,\nand it resets them to something else, and\n\n485\n00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.420\nnow I've lost the permissions, right?\n\n486\n00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:36.340\nSo the default is it's going\nto ignore the permissions.\n\n487\n00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.190\nEven though the permissions are there and\n\n488\n00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:41.830\nyou can see that if you pull up\nthe information on the drive itself.\n\n489\n00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:46.520\nSo if I do a Get Info on a drive\nitself and we take a look at it.\n\n490\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.550\nSo here's the thumb drive and\nsee how I have read and write.\n\n491\n00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.740\nStaff has read and write,\nthat's other users in this computer, and\n\n492\n00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.050\neveryone else is read only.\n\n493\n00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:57.910\nSo in theory, if I plug this into another\ncomputer, it should be read only.\n\n494\n00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.060\nCorrect?\n\n495\n00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.630\nWell, not necessarily,\n\n496\n00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:05.590\nbecause if you look down just a little bit\nfurther, grayed out kind of hidden away,\n\n497\n00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:10.750\nhard to see Ignore ownership on\nthis volume and it's checked, okay.\n\n498\n00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.336\nI'm gonna hit the lock to unlock this so\nwe'll actually be able to see it.\n\n499\n00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.780\nAnd there it is is in\na color we can actually read.\n\n500\n00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.696\nSo it's gonna ignore the ownership.\n\n501\n00:23:20.696 --> 00:23:22.270\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n502\n00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.220\nIt means I can set permissions\nto my heart's content and\n\n503\n00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.310\nthey're only going to\nwork here on my computer.\n\n504\n00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.770\nIt's really not gonna make a difference,\nright.\n\n505\n00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.810\nAnd that's kind of a weakness\nin a removable media.\n\n506\n00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.880\nIf I wanna enforce that,\nI need to turn that off,\n\n507\n00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.950\nand when I turn that\noff look what happened.\n\n508\n00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.410\nThe user change to system.\n\n509\n00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.590\nIt's not tied to my computer.\n\n510\n00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:45.720\nThe group changed to wheel,\nagain tied to my computer.\n\n511\n00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.760\nAnd then everyone, so\nit's altered these groups.\n\n512\n00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.600\nI can still come in here and modify it.\n\n513\n00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.120\nI can still come in here and\nsay I want to stick Daniel on here and\n\n514\n00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.390\nstart to define those permissions\nbased on what it is that I want.\n\n515\n00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:58.788\nI can still do that.\n\n516\n00:23:58.788 --> 00:24:01.752\nBut the permission's not being reset and\nthe reason is,\n\n517\n00:24:01.752 --> 00:24:05.103\nthe permissions that were there\nkind of weren't really there.\n\n518\n00:24:05.103 --> 00:24:07.007\nThey were more like suggestions.\n\n519\n00:24:07.007 --> 00:24:10.199\n[LAUGH] We suggest these\nare the people that have access but\n\n520\n00:24:10.199 --> 00:24:11.740\nfeel free to override it.\n\n521\n00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.710\nIt's okay, I'm cool with that.\n\n522\n00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.440\nThat's how it was.\n\n523\n00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.405\nNow we're saying,\nno we wanna enforce these.\n\n524\n00:24:17.405 --> 00:24:19.860\nNow the reality is you plug\nthis into another computer,\n\n525\n00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.660\nthey can still overwrite it, right?\n\n526\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.950\nIf you are the owner,\nif you're an admin account on a system\n\n527\n00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.070\nyou will always be able\nto override this stuff.\n\n528\n00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.390\nYou can pseudo with the chmod command and\nchange permissions,\n\n529\n00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:32.530\nchange ownership across the drive.\n\n530\n00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.560\nYou can do that, cuz you're an admin.\n\n531\n00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.080\nSo, it's still not enforced and\nthat's why I say you need to encrypt.\n\n532\n00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.665\nEncrypt the disk if you want to\nensure that your content stays safe.\n\n533\n00:24:40.665 --> 00:24:45.133\nBut, if it's not encrypted,\nthen we can just set it like this and\n\n534\n00:24:45.133 --> 00:24:46.690\nhope for the best.\n\n535\n00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.880\nNow, where I bump into this as a problem\nis like, I have a Mac Mini at home and\n\n536\n00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.490\nit's got two hard drives in it.\n\n537\n00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.465\nWell, the Macintosh HD, that's the first\nhard drive, that's the main one and\n\n538\n00:24:54.465 --> 00:24:55.510\nit's set as normal.\n\n539\n00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.440\nBut the other one when I formatted it,\nfor whatever reason, even though\n\n540\n00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:03.110\nit was internal drive, my system saw it as\nremovable and it ignored ownership on it.\n\n541\n00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.570\nI went and turned that off because I\nwas no, no, this is an internal drive.\n\n542\n00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.480\nI want to obey those permissions,\nand so I had to set it.\n\n543\n00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.040\nSo always be on the lookout for that one.\n\n544\n00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.630\nThat little, it's easy to miss,\nespecially when it's\n\n545\n00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.580\nthe medium gray on top of a light gray,\nit's real easy to miss.\n\n546\n00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:18.690\nIgnore ownership on this volume.\n\n547\n00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.065\n>> It's like it's camouflaged,\ntrying to keep you from seeing it.\n\n548\n00:25:21.065 --> 00:25:22.611\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's super annoying is what it is.\n\n549\n00:25:22.611 --> 00:25:26.199\n[LAUGH] But yeah, when that's turned on,\nit effectively kills the permissions on\n\n550\n00:25:26.199 --> 00:25:29.527\nthe disk and you might as well not have\nthem so, just a different behavior for\n\n551\n00:25:29.527 --> 00:25:31.503\nremoval of media that\nyou need to be aware of.\n\n552\n00:25:31.503 --> 00:25:33.200\n>> Yeah, definitely something\nyou gotta look out for.\n\n553\n00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.970\nYou don't wanna think, yeah,\nI'll just set those permissions and\n\n554\n00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:36.820\neverything will work fine.\n\n555\n00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.000\nYou gotta look out for\n\n556\n00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.410\nthose caveats that they like to shove\nin our operating systems for us.\n\n557\n00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.112\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don,\n\n558\n00:25:42.112 --> 00:25:44.395\nis there anything else\nabout file permissions?\n\n559\n00:25:44.395 --> 00:25:46.208\nWe've had quite a journey here, so far.\n\n560\n00:25:46.208 --> 00:25:47.846\nI'm sure you've got plenty more.\n\n561\n00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:50.835\n>> I think I'm all permissioned out,\nDaniel, to be honest with you.\n\n562\n00:25:50.835 --> 00:25:53.170\nSo, just be aware,\nwhen we talk about permissions,\n\n563\n00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.010\nit really is the OS X Extended Journal,\nthat's where that happens.\n\n564\n00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.845\nWhen you go exFAT, when you go regular\nFAT, when you go to any of the other\n\n565\n00:25:59.845 --> 00:26:04.280\nUnix-y stuff type formats, you lose a lot\nof the extra permissions that we have.\n\n566\n00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.610\nSo it is tied to that file system.\n\n567\n00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.530\n>> All right, Don, well thank you so\nmuch for explaining these different file\n\n568\n00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.540\nsystems and permissions that\nare gonna be used on top of them.\n\n569\n00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.723\nEspecially that Extended Journal one,\nwanna keep that in the brain,\n\n570\n00:26:14.723 --> 00:26:15.874\ngonna need to know that for the test.\n\n571\n00:26:15.874 --> 00:26:19.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And again, thank you for stopping by.\n\n572\n00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:20.390\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n573\n00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.220\nWe're going to go ahead and\n\n574\n00:26:21.220 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.330\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.430\nin today's episode we\nare continuing on with our Apple,\n\n5\n00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.470\nif I can just say that word, Apple\nCertified Support Professional Series.\n\n6\n00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.949\nJoining us back in the studio today,\nto help us out with that very endeavor,\n\n7\n00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.670\nis none other than our good friend,\nMr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.300\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.200\n>> Thanks for having me back, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.160\nWe're ready to jump right\nback into the support world.\n\n11\n00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.940\nAnd in this episode, we're going\nto take a look at managing files.\n\n12\n00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.250\nNow, in our last couple of episodes we\ntalked about managing file permissions.\n\n13\n00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.980\nWe've kind of been working\nwith files a bit, but\n\n14\n00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.486\nI want to talk about the files themselves.\n\n15\n00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:49.210\nBecause in OS X there's actually several\ndifferent types of files that we\n\n16\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.400\nencounter, and\nfrom the user interface, from the GUI,\n\n17\n00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.070\nyou might not notice the difference on\nthese, a lot of them look the same.\n\n18\n00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.990\nBut we need to understand\nexactly what they are,\n\n19\n00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.780\nbecause as a support professional, these\nare the things that we have to deal with.\n\n20\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.850\nSo I wanna start with a neat topic,\nit's called an alias.\n\n21\n00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.645\nAnd that when you have a file in your\nhard drive, it's normally a single file,\n\n22\n00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:12.700\nit exists in one place, and that's it.\n\n23\n00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.160\nBut we might wanna link to that\nfile from more than one place.\n\n24\n00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.220\nAnd back in the old days, so if any of\nyou guys ran Mac OS 9.6 or earlier,\n\n25\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.440\nyou had these aliases that were there, and\nthat was the one system you had for it.\n\n26\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.470\nBut in OS X, we have not only\nthe old alias system that's still,\n\n27\n00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.610\nI shouldn't call it the old alias\nsystem cuz they kinda revamped it and\n\n28\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.310\nmade it a lot better, so\nwe still have that alias system, but\n\n29\n00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.800\nwe also have all the BSD.\n\n30\n00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.580\nAll the UNIX technologies under the hood,\nso we can do soft and hard links,\n\n31\n00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.500\nwhich are part of the UNIX subsystem.\n\n32\n00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.562\nSo, there's more than one way to link to\na file in multiple places on your system.\n\n33\n00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:52.027\nAnd it does get a little confusing,\nso we want to walk through those,\n\n34\n00:01:52.027 --> 00:01:55.019\nas well as some other file technologies\nthat we're gonna see later in the episode.\n\n35\n00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.880\nAll right, well let's kick this thing off,\nand I'll give you an example.\n\n36\n00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.730\nSo I've got a Mac fired up here,\n\n37\n00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.008\nand normally,\nlet's say I'm making my documents, right?\n\n38\n00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:07.890\nAnd I know we've talked\nabout it in other episodes,\n\n39\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.280\nabout how we can turn on file encryption,\nand\n\n40\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.260\nwe can turn on file permissions, and\ncustomize who has access to what.\n\n41\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.260\nWhen I start creating documents, I usually\nkeep them in my Documents folder, and\n\n42\n00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.405\nthat's where I want them to sit.\n\n43\n00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:23.250\nAnd if I move them out\nof my Documents folder,\n\n44\n00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.480\nI run the risk of putting them\nsomewhere that's not secure,\n\n45\n00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.890\nwhere people might be able to gain\naccess to them unintentionally.\n\n46\n00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.620\nAnd so I want to make sure that my\ndocuments stay in that Documents folder.\n\n47\n00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.480\nAnd thanks to Apple's defaults here, when\nI go into the Finder, I've got a favorite\n\n48\n00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.040\nfor my Documents folder, and I can jump\nright in, and here's all my stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.840\nI see these documents that I made, my\nfirst draft, my second draft, and so on.\n\n50\n00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.550\nBut, there's a little bit\nof a problem with this.\n\n51\n00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.830\nSo when I come under Favorites, and\n\n52\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.120\nI go to Documents,\nsee how that just changed on me?\n\n53\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.480\nWhat I was actually looking\nat was All My Files, right?\n\n54\n00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.250\nAll My Files, is a list of,\nwell oddly enough,\n\n55\n00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.820\nall of your files irrespective of\nthe subdirectories that they're in.\n\n56\n00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.230\nSo I am seeing these documents here,\nSecond Draft, First Draft, Show 1, Show 2,\n\n57\n00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.360\nand these are all in different files.\n\n58\n00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.250\nAnd these are actually\nin my Documents folder.\n\n59\n00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.380\nI'm seeing some other things\nthat I've downloaded,\n\n60\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.240\nthese are my Downloads folder, and\nit's just lumped them all together.\n\n61\n00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.150\nBut if I go here to Downloads,\nI can see Virtual Box, Google Chrome.\n\n62\n00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.990\nIf I go to Documents,\nnow I see some folders.\n\n63\n00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.740\nI've got a Manuscript folder and\na Show Notes folder.\n\n64\n00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.970\nAnd if I expand those out,\nthere's these documents that I've got,\n\n65\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.480\nand they're all in their respective\nfolders, nice and organized, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.260\nBut I had to go to the Finder, and\nthen I had to go to Documents,\n\n67\n00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260\nI had to browse into it and find it.\n\n68\n00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.481\nWhat if you've got one of\nthose end users who says,\n\n69\n00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:44.870\nI just don't like clicking\nthrough all of that stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.854\nWhen I come in in the morning, I want to\ngo straight to this folder, and get at it.\n\n71\n00:03:47.854 --> 00:03:51.690\nWell, they could just take this folder and\nmove it somewhere else.\n\n72\n00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.150\nThey can move it to their desktop,\nmove it elsewhere.\n\n73\n00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.370\nWhat's the risk with that?\n\n74\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.980\nThe risk is, let's say that I'm backing up\npeople's computers, and I'm just backing\n\n75\n00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.020\nup their Documents folder, but they've\nmoved this folder to their desktop.\n\n76\n00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.080\nIf they move it to their desktop, it's now\ngone from here, and it's on their desktop.\n\n77\n00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.530\nAnd so it's easier for them to get to it.\n\n78\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.720\nThey come in the morning,\nthey just click on Show Notes, and\n\n79\n00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.550\nthere's their show notes, right?\n\n80\n00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.980\nBut I'm only backing up\ntheir Documents folder.\n\n81\n00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.740\nSo what would've been better,\n\n82\n00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.270\nwould be instead of moving the document to\nthe desktop, is just to put a shortcut.\n\n83\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.030\nPut a link on the desktop,\nto be able to get to it.\n\n84\n00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.050\nAnd in Mac OS that's pretty easy.\n\n85\n00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.350\nYou can take any of these items, and if\nyou control-click, or right-click on it,\n\n86\n00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.240\nyou can get in here, and\nyou can choose to make an alias, right?\n\n87\n00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.930\nI usually just command L,\nas another way that you can do it.\n\n88\n00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.506\nBut when you make an alias,\nsee what it made?\n\n89\n00:04:41.506 --> 00:04:43.712\nThis Show Notes alias file for me.\n\n90\n00:04:43.712 --> 00:04:47.316\nAnd the Show Notes alias file is,\nI'm gonna say it Daniel,\n\n91\n00:04:47.316 --> 00:04:48.913\nit's somewhat magical.\n\n92\n00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:49.872\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What it is,\n\n93\n00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:51.990\nis it's actually pretty interesting.\n\n94\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.400\nIt is a file.\n\n95\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.210\nAnd it's a pointer that helps us\nfind the original data, all right?\n\n96\n00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.430\nBut the cool part about it is,\nit's not really dependent on anything.\n\n97\n00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.470\nYou can rename it,\ncall it whatever you want.\n\n98\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.872\nSo If I move it to my desktop, I'm just\ngonna drop that out here on my desktop.\n\n99\n00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:13.444\nSo now I've got the original data,\nwhich is still in my Documents folder,\n\n100\n00:05:13.444 --> 00:05:16.976\nI can browse and I can find it, and\nhere's the alias file that I just made.\n\n101\n00:05:16.976 --> 00:05:21.088\nAnd I can rename that to\npretty much whatever.\n\n102\n00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:24.480\nSo I'm gonna rename it,\nmaybe I'll just call it Notes, right?\n\n103\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.070\nDoes it matter that the name doesn't\nmatch the original file anymore, right?\n\n104\n00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.540\nThe name of this is Notes,\nthe original file is Show Notes.\n\n105\n00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.520\nThat's okay, that doesn't matter.\n\n106\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.640\nIf I click on this, it's gonna open up and\nit's gonna take me right to my show notes,\n\n107\n00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.300\nthere they are.\n\n108\n00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.240\nI get into it, and I can access the data,\nnow I've got one click to go there.\n\n109\n00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.120\nMy data stays in the Documents folder,\nbut I've got a link on my desktop.\n\n110\n00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.360\nNow let's talk a little\nbit about that link.\n\n111\n00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.230\nI say it's magical.\n\n112\n00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.200\nWhat the heck do I mean by that?\n\n113\n00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.342\nBecause, that's a garbage term.\n\n114\n00:05:52.342 --> 00:05:54.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It's not a garbage term,\n\n115\n00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.330\nit's a marketing term.\n\n116\n00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.316\n>> It means it can fly.\n\n117\n00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:57.986\n[LAUGH]\n>> It can cure cancer,\n\n118\n00:05:57.986 --> 00:05:59.420\nit can do all sorts of things.\n\n119\n00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.330\n>> This thing's awesome.\n\n120\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.860\n>> But what it really is,\nis a tracker, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.980\nWhen you create that link, it's doing\na lot more than just saying, yeah,\n\n122\n00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.470\nthe original file's over here.\n\n123\n00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.860\nIt's actually tracking the original file.\n\n124\n00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.140\nIt's tracking where it is.\n\n125\n00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.770\nIf I rename the original file,\n\n126\n00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.290\nif I move the original file,\nthis alias would be okay with that.\n\n127\n00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.240\nIt'll follow it.\n\n128\n00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.617\nIt'll follow it, and still link to it.\n\n129\n00:06:20.617 --> 00:06:25.397\nSo if I drop to my terminal here,\nand I go over to my desktop, and\n\n130\n00:06:25.397 --> 00:06:31.193\nI take a look at the files that are in\nthere, notice that Notes link, right?\n\n131\n00:06:31.193 --> 00:06:33.790\nThere's the Notes, and\nit just looks like a folder to me.\n\n132\n00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.880\nIf I look at my permissions though,\nthere's no d.\n\n133\n00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.270\nIt's not a directory, right?\n\n134\n00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.603\nIn UNIX, or Linux, or any of the BSD\nUNIX-type environments like we've got\n\n135\n00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:47.080\nhere, if it's a folder,\nyou'll have a d for directory.\n\n136\n00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.870\nThis is a dash,\nbecause it's actually a link file.\n\n137\n00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.630\nIt's a file that points somewhere else.\n\n138\n00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.318\nAnd it's got special attributes attached,\nI've got the little @ symbol there,\n\n139\n00:06:54.318 --> 00:06:55.040\nletting me know that.\n\n140\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.655\nSo I know that it's got more\nthan meets the eye here,\n\n141\n00:06:58.655 --> 00:07:00.290\nthan what we've got with just the file.\n\n142\n00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.040\nBut the cool thing,\nmaybe not the cool thing, but\n\n143\n00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.420\nthe real indicator I guess, is the size.\n\n144\n00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.640\nLook at the size on that thing.\n\n145\n00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.968\nIf we take a look at the size,\noops, I wanted to add-\n\n146\n00:07:09.968 --> 00:07:12.005\n>> Where's your h, Don?\n\n147\n00:07:12.005 --> 00:07:14.700\n>> I know, I'm screwing this up here,\nmy mouse is going crazy.\n\n148\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.835\nThere we go.\n\n149\n00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:23.620\nSo if we take a look at that,\nthat little Notes alias, is 1.2M in size.\n\n150\n00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.620\nWhy the heck would an alias, a link that\npoints, supposed to be 1.2M in size?\n\n151\n00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.950\nWell, because it's magic.\n\n152\n00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:32.734\n>> It's magic dust.\n\n153\n00:07:32.734 --> 00:07:33.490\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n154\n00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.990\nif you wanted to do a lot,\nit takes a lot to do it.\n\n155\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.660\nWhen you create an alias,\nthe minimum size I think that I've seen,\n\n156\n00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.980\nis usually around 200k,\nthey're a decent size.\n\n157\n00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.110\nBecause it's almost more\nlike a database in a way,\n\n158\n00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.540\nit's saying I've gotta track where this\nother stuff is, to be able to find it.\n\n159\n00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.982\nSo the size can be a little bit large, and\n\n160\n00:07:50.982 --> 00:07:53.410\nit'll actually reflect the size\nof the original Notes file, too.\n\n161\n00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.407\nSo if I start adding more stuff to that\nnotes folder, this will grow and grow and\n\n162\n00:07:57.407 --> 00:07:58.571\ngrow to reflect that.\n\n163\n00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:01.309\nIt's not actually taking double space,\nIt's just reflecting that size because\n\n164\n00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:03.784\nit's pointing to the original, so\nwe're gonna see that reflected too.\n\n165\n00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:08.140\nSo you can't really trust\nthe size of an alias file.\n\n166\n00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.460\nBut if you make an alias\nof an empty folder,\n\n167\n00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.450\nit'll still be a good 200K just because\nthat's kinda the base size of that alias.\n\n168\n00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.870\nAnd then it'll reflect\nthe additional size of that folder.\n\n169\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.560\nSo it is a little bit on the magical side.\n\n170\n00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.770\nIt's doing a lot.\n\n171\n00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.480\nLet's see it in action.\n\n172\n00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.110\nSo if I go back to my desktop\nhere I've created this alias.\n\n173\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.950\nI know it's an alias because it's\ngot that little black arrow on it.\n\n174\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.570\nThat arrow tells me that this is\nactually pointing somewhere else.\n\n175\n00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.510\nIt's not a true item here on my desktop.\n\n176\n00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.920\nNow one of the tricks about shortcuts is\nthat they usually point to some location\n\n177\n00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.540\nand if that location changes,\nwe've got a problem right.\n\n178\n00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.000\nSo if I take that Show Notes folder,\nand I rename it.\n\n179\n00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.080\nSo I'm going to rename it.\n\n180\n00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.370\nThis is going to be come my\nLegacy Show Notes, all right?\n\n181\n00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.070\nSo It's not Show Notes anymore,\nnow it's Legacy Show Notes.\n\n182\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.770\nAnd when I go over here and I take\nthat Notes folder and I click on it,\n\n183\n00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.060\nwhat's going to happen?\n\n184\n00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.150\nWell, it was pointing to my\ndocuments folder and looking for\n\n185\n00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.640\na folder called Show Notes.\n\n186\n00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.450\nBut when I run it, it still works.\n\n187\n00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.330\nIt doesn't care that the original\nfolder changed names.\n\n188\n00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.560\nIn fact, if I go and\ntake that original folder,\n\n189\n00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.680\nI'm going to take that Legacy Show Notes,\nand let's say that I move it\n\n190\n00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.820\ninto my Downloads folder,\nwhich is not where it really should be.\n\n191\n00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.090\nBut, that's where I'm going to move it.\n\n192\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.180\nSo now it's in my Downloads folder.\n\n193\n00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.000\nI moved the target.\n\n194\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.810\nSo this alias is now pointing\nto the wrong spot, right?\n\n195\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.870\nWell, it still works.\n\n196\n00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.820\nThat's the magic of the aliases and\nit's not magic, right?\n\n197\n00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.020\nIt is like a database,\nit's tracking that location,\n\n198\n00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.570\nthe original data and when the original\ndata moves or changes name or whatever,\n\n199\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.670\nthe aliases dynamically and automatically\nupdated, we never have to worry about it.\n\n200\n00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.500\nSo aliases are really cool,\n\n201\n00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.850\nreally flexible and\na great way to create shortcuts to things.\n\n202\n00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.620\nAnd I made a shortcut here to a folder.\n\n203\n00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.580\nYou can make a shortcut to\na specific file, to an application.\n\n204\n00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.960\nYou can do whatever you want and\n\n205\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.790\nyou can do it through those\naliases to get that and\n\n206\n00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.420\ncreate a pretty streamlined system there\nthat makes it easy to access that data.\n\n207\n00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.789\n>> Yeah, Don.\nI've used this in particular in enterprise\n\n208\n00:10:02.789 --> 00:10:05.100\nsolutions, working at a help desk.\n\n209\n00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.480\nYou get people who say we've\nhired a new person, and\n\n210\n00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.740\nwell now the old person's gone.\n\n211\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.360\nWe need the new person to\nhave access to their stuff.\n\n212\n00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.450\nWell you remember there's profiles and\npeople have their own user accounts,\n\n213\n00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.940\ntheir own desktop,\nall their own folder systems.\n\n214\n00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.030\nWell instead of trying to copy all that\nstuff over, I would just give them rights\n\n215\n00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.140\nto that and make an alias,\na shortcut on their desktop.\n\n216\n00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.730\nDouble click on it, there's all\nthe files and everything they need.\n\n217\n00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.200\nIt was very, very simple for\nme to do and very convenient for\n\n218\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:35.220\nthe new user to be able to access\nthe old user's files and system.\n\n219\n00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.350\n>> Yeah, now, these get used a lot and\n\n220\n00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.430\nwhat I just showed you were\nthe aliases that are part of Mac OS.\n\n221\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.090\nBut I mentioned we still have the VSD,\nthe Unix links that we can do, too.\n\n222\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:48.540\nAnd so I know, Daniel,\nyou've worked on Linux a lot.\n\n223\n00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.100\nI'm sure you've used the,\nI call them hard and soft links.\n\n224\n00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.380\nBut there's actually hard links and\n\n225\n00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.390\nsymbolic links,\nthe soft ones are symbolic.\n\n226\n00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.540\nBut those links, they're still there,\nand you can still use them,\n\n227\n00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.860\nand there's a place for that.\n\n228\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.390\nBut for the most part,\nthe aliases I just showed you,\n\n229\n00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.170\nthose are going to be the best.\n\n230\n00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:06.450\nBecause they're powerful, they track the\noriginal, they do all sorts of neat stuff.\n\n231\n00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.850\nThe Unix links are a lot less forgiving.\n\n232\n00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.980\nThey're a lot more\nstrict in how they work.\n\n233\n00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.310\nLet me just kinda show you an example.\n\n234\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.186\nSo I'm going to move the,\nlet me get rid of this alias.\n\n235\n00:11:18.186 --> 00:11:20.130\nSo that he aliases on my desk top,\nthat Notes alias,\n\n236\n00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.510\nI'm just going to throw it away, right?\n\n237\n00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.161\nSo it's gone.\n\n238\n00:11:22.161 --> 00:11:24.750\nAnd once it's gone,\nI can go into my Downloads and\n\n239\n00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.597\nI'm gonna put my Legacy Show Notes\nback in Documents.\n\n240\n00:11:27.597 --> 00:11:30.160\nI'm just gonna undo the changes\nthat I made a moment ago.\n\n241\n00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.336\nSo we're gonna go back to this being\njust regular old Show Notes and\n\n242\n00:11:33.336 --> 00:11:34.477\nit's in my Documents.\n\n243\n00:11:34.477 --> 00:11:36.605\nAnd so somebody comes to me and says hey,\n\n244\n00:11:36.605 --> 00:11:40.499\nI wanna have a link to Show Notes on my\ndesktop so I can get to it, all right?\n\n245\n00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:44.910\nSo I coud do an alias or\nI could do a symbolic link.\n\n246\n00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.220\nA symbolic link is where I drop into the\nUnix subsystem and I do the link there.\n\n247\n00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.340\nSymbolic links are a lot\nless powerful though,\n\n248\n00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.870\nbecause they don't track the original.\n\n249\n00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.830\nThat's the problem with symbolic links.\n\n250\n00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.480\nSo if I jump into my terminal and\nI go this route, okay?\n\n251\n00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.740\nSo I want to add that link to my desktop.\n\n252\n00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.720\nSo I'm going to come in here and, just\nmake this window a little bit bigger for\n\n253\n00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.990\nme, and let's get into my desktop.\n\n254\n00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.910\nSo here I am on my desktop and\nI've got nothing in my desktop right now.\n\n255\n00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.390\nI feel like a magician, you know,\nthere's something up my sleeves.\n\n256\n00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.770\nAnd so I'm gonna do a link.\n\n257\n00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.630\nSo I'm gonna ln,\nln is the Unix command for creating links.\n\n258\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:25.669\nAnd I'm gonna do -s to let it know that\nI'm doing a symbolic link, or a soft link.\n\n259\n00:12:25.669 --> 00:12:30.098\nAnd I'm gonna specify the target,\nand the target for\n\n260\n00:12:30.098 --> 00:12:35.520\nme is going to be\n/user/dpezet/documents/Show\\ Notes/.\n\n261\n00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.319\nAnd there's a space in show notes, so\n\n262\n00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:40.720\nI've got to have a backslash in\nthere to account for that space.\n\n263\n00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.400\nI'm using tab auto complete so\nit will put that in there for me.\n\n264\n00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.060\nSo, that's the target.\n\n265\n00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.970\nAnd now I need to tell\nit the name of the link.\n\n266\n00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.310\nAnd the link I wanna be here on my\ndesktop, so in the folder that I'm in,\n\n267\n00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:57.010\nso I'll just say ./, and\nI'm gonna call it Show Notes.\n\n268\n00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.130\nSo I'm gonna create a folder called\nShow Notes here on my desktop,\n\n269\n00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.420\nand it's gonna link back to this folder.\n\n270\n00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.600\nAnd notice how I typed out the whole path.\n\n271\n00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:10.020\nI could have said like tilde\nslash documents slash whatever.\n\n272\n00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.740\nBut symbolic links really don't like you\nto use things like tilde slash because\n\n273\n00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.120\nwell, you know, your username could\nchange whatever breaks things so\n\n274\n00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.230\nyou do typically need\nto type that full path.\n\n275\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.800\nSo I'm gonna run that and\nthat's gonna create that link and\n\n276\n00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.850\nin the background, what do I see?\n\n277\n00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:29.910\nWell, there's a Show Notes alias and\nit's got the little arrow so\n\n278\n00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.490\nI know that it's a link.\n\n279\n00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:35.700\nAnd there it is,\njust like the alias in Mac OS, right?\n\n280\n00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.690\nWell, it's different,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n281\n00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.360\nSo if I take a look at my\ncommand prompt here and\n\n282\n00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.650\npull up the listing, I can see Show Notes.\n\n283\n00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.320\nAnd Show Notes has an L\nover here in the side.\n\n284\n00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.480\nSo remember when I did an alias it\njust showed as a dash, it was a file.\n\n285\n00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.430\nBut here it shows as an L.\n\n286\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.370\nIt knows it's a link and\nover here it shows,\n\n287\n00:13:55.370 --> 00:14:00.000\nShow Notes points to\n/Users/depezet/Documents/Show Notes.\n\n288\n00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.500\nSo it knows that it's a link and\nhere it's showing that path.\n\n289\n00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.170\nNow for the end user, they really\ndon't notice the difference, do they?\n\n290\n00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.870\nFor the end user,\nthey see a Show Notes folder, and\n\n291\n00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.640\nif they click on it,\nit takes them into Show Notes.\n\n292\n00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.900\nThey don't see a functional difference,\nright?\n\n293\n00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.700\nBut there is a difference.\n\n294\n00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:23.450\nIf I go and I go into my documents and\nI take Show Notes and I rename it.\n\n295\n00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.760\nSo I'm gonna rename it,\nLegacy Show Notes, right?\n\n296\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.350\nNow when I go over to this link and\nI run the link, it still works.\n\n297\n00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.880\nIt's actually okay with it,\nit's a different name, right?\n\n298\n00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.410\nBut if I move it,\nthat's where things are gonna break down.\n\n299\n00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:42.230\nIs it that link is pointing somewhere\nother than where we're going to.\n\n300\n00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.320\nSo if I take that and\nmove it over to my Downloads folder.\n\n301\n00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.170\nWhen I run that, now I get, the operation\ncan't be completed because the original\n\n302\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.080\nitem for Show Notes can't be found.\n\n303\n00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.410\nI've moved it somewhere else,\nand now it's broken.\n\n304\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:01.360\nSo those symbolic links don't\ntrack where our file is moving to.\n\n305\n00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.770\nThey just track a particular spot.\n\n306\n00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.840\nAnd so if I move it, it breaks it down.\n\n307\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.120\nSo if we can, the Mac aliases are a lot\nmore reliable than the Unix links.\n\n308\n00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.360\nNow, I showed you guys a symbolic link and\n\n309\n00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.540\nsymbolic links are great\nbecause they work for folders.\n\n310\n00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.070\nThey work for files.\n\n311\n00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.200\nThey work just like aliases except\nwithout all the tracking piece.\n\n312\n00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.990\nThere is one more type of link that\nyou're not gonna use very often, but\n\n313\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.390\nI do wanna show it to you,\nand that's a hard link.\n\n314\n00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.720\nWhen we do a symbolic link,\na symbolic link is pointing to a path,\n\n315\n00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.740\nsome location somewhere else.\n\n316\n00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.160\nWhen you do a hard link,\n\n317\n00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.890\nit's actually pointing to\nthe raw data on the hard drive.\n\n318\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.580\nAnd if you have a folder,\na folder has no raw data,\n\n319\n00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.760\na folder just has an entry\nin your file table.\n\n320\n00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.720\nSo hard links only work for files.\n\n321\n00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.320\nIf I wanna create an alias of a particular\nfile, I can create a hard link.\n\n322\n00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.096\nThe neat part about a hard link, is it\npoints to the actual sectors on the hard\n\n323\n00:15:49.096 --> 00:15:51.633\ndrive where that data is stored,\nthe binary data.\n\n324\n00:15:51.633 --> 00:15:53.739\nSo it doesn't care about\nthe name of the file,\n\n325\n00:15:53.739 --> 00:15:55.688\nit doesn't care about the folder or path.\n\n326\n00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:58.971\nSo you can move the file, you can rename\nit, and the hard link will still work.\n\n327\n00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:00.919\nRight?\nThat's kind of the positive side.\n\n328\n00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:04.500\nInfact you can even\ndelete the original file.\n\n329\n00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.380\nAnd UNIX under the hood will see that\nthere is still there is still a hard link.\n\n330\n00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.440\nAnd it'll keep the data.\n\n331\n00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.810\nSo, the hard link keeps working\neven if the original is deleted.\n\n332\n00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.190\nIt's kinda neat function.\n\n333\n00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.570\nMost of us never need that.\n\n334\n00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:15.500\nDevelopers use it.\n\n335\n00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.480\nIf they are trying to hard link to\nsome kind of library file that their\n\n336\n00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.260\napplication depends on.\n\n337\n00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.720\nIf you go and delete the library file,\n\n338\n00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.930\nthey don't want their\napplication to break.\n\n339\n00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:26.440\nSo, they do a hard link so that\nthe library will still be available for\n\n340\n00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.020\nthat program even after you delete it,\nit doesn't actually get deleted, right?\n\n341\n00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.710\n>> So, it makes sense for\ndevelopers to use it.\n\n342\n00:16:32.795 --> 00:16:35.735\nBut for an end user it doesn't,\nbecause we rename files,\n\n343\n00:16:35.735 --> 00:16:37.895\nwe move files,\nwe do things that kind of mess with it.\n\n344\n00:16:37.895 --> 00:16:39.905\nAnd when we delete a file,\nwe want to know it's deleted,\n\n345\n00:16:39.905 --> 00:16:41.935\nnot that it's still hanging\naround from some other program.\n\n346\n00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:44.715\nBut just for completeness, I do wanna\nshow you guys how hard links work.\n\n347\n00:16:44.715 --> 00:16:48.635\nI won't be able to link to a folder,\ncuz that's not what hard links do.\n\n348\n00:16:48.635 --> 00:16:52.590\nBut if I wanna link to a file,\nfor example.\n\n349\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:57.583\nSo, I could come in here,\nand I could do a link to.\n\n350\n00:16:57.583 --> 00:17:04.561\nLet's see, let's go into Manuscript here,\nand I'll get my first draft, right?\n\n351\n00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:07.590\nSo, I've got this first draft of\nthe great manuscript that I'm working on,\n\n352\n00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:08.340\nin my spare time.\n\n353\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.490\n>> The great American novel, Don.\n\n354\n00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.870\n>> That's right, which for most of\nyou guys that know me, I hate typing.\n\n355\n00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.103\nSo, it's never gonna happen.\n\n356\n00:17:14.103 --> 00:17:15.765\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, so I'm gonna link this to\n\n357\n00:17:15.765 --> 00:17:16.890\nmy Desktop.\n\n358\n00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.430\nAnd so\nI can just point that to my Desktop and\n\n359\n00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:23.350\nI'll just call it file.rtf\ncuz I'm a lazy typer.\n\n360\n00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:24.710\nSo, I'm gonna create this link.\n\n361\n00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.840\nNow the link, I'm creating it the same\nway I did a symbolic link but\n\n362\n00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.480\ninstead of doing the -s for symbolic,\nI'm not doing a dash anything.\n\n363\n00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.440\nThe default is a hard link.\n\n364\n00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.170\nAnd so, when I run that, it's going\nto create the file on my desktop.\n\n365\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.600\nAnd notice how there's no arrow on it.\n\n366\n00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.010\nIt's not an alias.\n\n367\n00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.540\nHard links are not technically links.\n\n368\n00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.880\nWhen you create a hard link,\nit thinks this is the file.\n\n369\n00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.360\nThis is a pointer to the raw data\non the hard drive, and if I go into\n\n370\n00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.410\nMy Documents folder, that one there is\na hard pointer to the original file.\n\n371\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.650\nI've now got two pointers\nto the same file.\n\n372\n00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.880\nAnd if I delete one\nthe other one stays around.\n\n373\n00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.680\nSo a hard link is cool because you\ndon't even notice it's an alias,\n\n374\n00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.620\nand that's part of the reason\ndevelopers like to use it.\n\n375\n00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.870\nBut they're fairly sensitive and\nthat if I do move that data,\n\n376\n00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.440\nlike move it to a new drive,\nall the hard links brake, right?\n\n377\n00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.130\nBut for\n\n378\n00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.870\na developer this works pretty well, their\nprogram can rely on that library existing.\n\n379\n00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.360\nFor the end user they just see that rtf,\nthey run it, and they open it up and\n\n380\n00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.140\nhere's that document.\n\n381\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:29.730\nAnd if we look at from the command\nline here, there's that file.rtf.\n\n382\n00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.840\nAnd notice it doesn't show up as a link.\n\n383\n00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.520\nThere's no pointer over here.\n\n384\n00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:41.080\nA hard link is an actual file table entry\nthat says this file is in this folder.\n\n385\n00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.400\nBut the raw data is somewhere else and\nthat raw data is still,\n\n386\n00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:50.330\nif I get into my documents folder and\nmy manuscript folder,\n\n387\n00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.280\nI pointed that to first draft and\nfirst draft still exists right here.\n\n388\n00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.000\nAnd it's not a pointer or\nanything like that.\n\n389\n00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.640\nIn the GUI,\nthey look like two independent files, but\n\n390\n00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.190\nthey're pointing to the same\ndata on the hard drive.\n\n391\n00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.770\nAnd if I go and delete one, it's okay.\n\n392\n00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.920\nThe other one still has\npointers to that data.\n\n393\n00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.710\nSo it's kind of a neat\nlittle system there.\n\n394\n00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.760\nAgain, not something your end users\nare gonna make a lot of use of, but\n\n395\n00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.820\nsomething you need to be aware of.\n\n396\n00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.760\n>> Now Don, what will happen if, let's say\nyou had both of those pointer files open\n\n397\n00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.610\nand were editing or commenting on\ndoing something inside of them, and\n\n398\n00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.100\nyou save them both at the same time,\nwho wins?\n\n399\n00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.000\n>> Whoever saves last.\n\n400\n00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.660\n>> Whoever saves last?\n\n401\n00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.470\n>> Yeah, whoever saves last.\n\n402\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.280\nBecause let's say you save and\na second later I save.\n\n403\n00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.280\nYour save actually worked.\n\n404\n00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.420\nYou saved the data, but then when I\nsave I just overwrite your data and\n\n405\n00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.420\nthat's the end of it.\n\n406\n00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.260\nSo, you gotta be careful\nwith hard links for that.\n\n407\n00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.490\nAnd if it's a library file,\nyou don't write to a library file.\n\n408\n00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:40.740\nIt's created you just reference it.\n\n409\n00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.870\nYou read from it and\nthat's what works great and again more for\n\n410\n00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:44.250\nthe developer's side.\n\n411\n00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.230\n>> Very cool.\n>> All right so, those are some examples\n\n412\n00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.380\nof links, definitely the aliases\nare the one's we want.\n\n413\n00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.020\nThe main reason on the exam, if they ask\nwhich you would use in this scenario\n\n414\n00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.990\nis that the Mac aliases, they track\nthe original link, you can rename it,\n\n415\n00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.600\nyou can move it, you can do all sorts of\nstuff to it and the alias still works.\n\n416\n00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.850\nThey're super easy to create, you can\ncreate them in a GUI, they work wonderful.\n\n417\n00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:05.470\nHard links and symbolic links?\n\n418\n00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.490\nYou can't create them from the GUI.\n\n419\n00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.620\nYou have to create them\nfrom the command line.\n\n420\n00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.960\nThe GUI will follow them.\n\n421\n00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.800\nYou can use the links in the GUI but\nyou can't create them.\n\n422\n00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.910\nSo, if you're scripting things and\nautomating things,\n\n423\n00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.950\ndoing it from the command\nline might work out well.\n\n424\n00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.080\nYou can use Automater to create aliases,\nthough.\n\n425\n00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.570\nSo you can create those.\n\n426\n00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.773\nYou'll typically want\nto use the Mac aliases.\n\n427\n00:20:22.773 --> 00:20:25.931\nAll right, so that's about it for aliases.\n\n428\n00:20:25.931 --> 00:20:29.425\nI do wanna talk a little bit more about\nsome other special file types that\n\n429\n00:20:29.425 --> 00:20:30.190\nare out there.\n\n430\n00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:34.560\nI've been working here with text files,\nright or rtfs or whatever just simple\n\n431\n00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.259\nfiles, simple folders, but not every file\non your hard drive is created equally and\n\n432\n00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:42.793\nno where is that more obvious\nthan we do a programs, all right?\n\n433\n00:20:42.793 --> 00:20:46.070\nWhen you download an application\nfrom the internet, for example,\n\n434\n00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.403\nyou need to get that application and\nget it loaded into your system and\n\n435\n00:20:49.403 --> 00:20:51.670\nit just looks like one file.\n\n436\n00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.410\nBut it's actually a lot\nmore than just one file.\n\n437\n00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:58.080\nWhen you download a program,\na program has a lot of moving pieces.\n\n438\n00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.110\nA document like my manuscript here\nis It's just a single rtf.file.\n\n439\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.560\nEverything is enclosed in that one file.\n\n440\n00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.270\nThat's all that we need.\n\n441\n00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.850\nBut a program might reference library\nfiles, like I mentioned earlier.\n\n442\n00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.850\nIt might reference other programs,\n\n443\n00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.510\nit might have all sorts of different\nbells and whistles that are part of it.\n\n444\n00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:18.470\nAnd so, we need a way where we can\neasily distribute those applications.\n\n445\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.200\nAnd not make the end user aware\nthat there's actually a thousand\n\n446\n00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.247\nfiles behind the scenes.\n\n447\n00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:24.357\nIf you take Microsoft Word for example,\n\n448\n00:21:24.357 --> 00:21:28.190\nthere's a thousand files at\na minimum inside of that program.\n\n449\n00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:31.120\nBut we just see it as one single file.\n\n450\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.580\nAll right, so how does that work?\n\n451\n00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:38.100\nWell, applications in\nMac OS are called bundles.\n\n452\n00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.400\nA bundle means that it's a bunch\nof files gathered together.\n\n453\n00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.640\nWe're going to get another episode\nwhere we talk about archives and\n\n454\n00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.510\nhow we can create archive files.\n\n455\n00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.570\nBut applications aren't archives,\nthey're bundles,\n\n456\n00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.300\nthey're files that aren't compressed\nthere just ready to be used.\n\n457\n00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.510\nBut when I browse on the hard drive\nthat's not what I see, right?\n\n458\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.090\nLet me show you.\n\n459\n00:21:55.090 --> 00:22:00.030\nSo, if go into my application's folder,\nI see a bunch of applications and\n\n460\n00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:02.240\nhere they are, App Store, whatever.\n\n461\n00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.050\nMaybe I go out on the internet and\nI got to download an application.\n\n462\n00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.110\nFor example, before the show I\ndownloaded a program called Cyberduck.\n\n463\n00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:12.010\nAnd when you go to Cyberduck's website\nyou can download the application,\n\n464\n00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.595\nit's a whopping 185 MB,\nit's not terribly big.\n\n465\n00:22:14.595 --> 00:22:18.540\nAnd you can download it and\nyou can just drag it and\n\n466\n00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.780\ndrop it to your applications folder and\nit's one file.\n\n467\n00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:25.590\nAnd when I go into applications, there's\nCyberduck and I can open that application.\n\n468\n00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.430\nI gotta get past my gate keeper\ncuz I haven't run it yet.\n\n469\n00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:31.460\nAnd then once it fires up,\nI'm now in Cyberduck.\n\n470\n00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.370\nI see one file, I run it,\nand it's one program, okay.\n\n471\n00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.930\nWell, whenever it finishes loading.\n\n472\n00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.960\nSo here it goes kinda launching and\ndoing it's thing.\n\n473\n00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.812\nBut it is going to fire up eventually.\n\n474\n00:22:41.812 --> 00:22:43.680\nThere it is.\nAll right so now Cyberduck is up and\n\n475\n00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.500\nrunning and I'm in my program, okay?\n\n476\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.810\nBut if we look at that from the command\nline, let me get into my applications\n\n477\n00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:55.710\nfolder, and I'm just gonna do\nlike a regular list, right?\n\n478\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:59.640\nWhen I do a regular list I can\nfind Cyberduck in the list.\n\n479\n00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.178\nThere it is.\n\n480\n00:23:00.178 --> 00:23:03.910\nAnd it's Cyberduck.app.\n\n481\n00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.090\nI didn't see .app in the UI, but\nI kind of expect that, right?\n\n482\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.220\nMac OS,\nit hides file extensions by default.\n\n483\n00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.670\nApplications end in .app, right?\n\n484\n00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:13.742\nIt's an application.\n\n485\n00:23:13.742 --> 00:23:15.940\nThose rtf.files that I was\nworking with earlier, right?\n\n486\n00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.860\nRTF, rich text format.\n\n487\n00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.050\nBut if I browse to my documents folder.\n\n488\n00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:25.400\nAnd I go on there and I find those\ndocuments, I don't see .rtf it hides that.\n\n489\n00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.400\nIt's cause it got a nice little icon\nhere that's supposed to clue me in.\n\n490\n00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.990\nBut even if I don't have the icon,\n\n491\n00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.310\nthere's a column here,\nactually it's a column that's hidden.\n\n492\n00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.950\nWe're gonna add in a column called type or\nkind, there we go.\n\n493\n00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:37.830\nOops, it's already checked.\n\n494\n00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:38.925\nDid I miss the kind column?\n\n495\n00:23:38.925 --> 00:23:40.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's way over here.\n\n496\n00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.390\nAnd I can see that it's an RTF document.\n\n497\n00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:43.170\nThere it is.\n\n498\n00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.620\nAnd we can see that's what it is, right?\n\n499\n00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.700\nSo I don't necessarily need to\nsee the extension day after day.\n\n500\n00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.800\nAnd most people default\nto the icon view anyway.\n\n501\n00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.430\nAnd in the icon view, you can see it\nright there in the icon what it is.\n\n502\n00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.071\nWhat do I need an extension for?\n\n503\n00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:56.983\nWell, applications it's even more so,\nright?\n\n504\n00:23:56.983 --> 00:24:01.277\nWith an application, I just need to see\nthe pretty icons and there's CyberDuck.\n\n505\n00:24:01.277 --> 00:24:02.174\nThat's what I wanna run.\n\n506\n00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:03.924\nIt's got a rubber ducky, right?\n\n507\n00:24:03.924 --> 00:24:08.200\nBut in the files, if I take a look\nat this from the terminal, and\n\n508\n00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:14.150\nI pull up the long listing, notice how all\nthese applications, they all end in .app.\n\n509\n00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.740\nAnd here's the one that I installed,\n\n510\n00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.880\nyou can tell I installed it cuz it's\ntied to me, shows the owner is dpezet.\n\n511\n00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.480\nAnd over here, I can see it's\nactually a directory, right?\n\n512\n00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.150\nIt's got that d flag in the permissions\nthat are letting me know that that is\n\n513\n00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.700\na directory and not a file.\n\n514\n00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.240\nIf it were a file,\nI'd expect to see a dash there, right?\n\n515\n00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.960\nThe reason it's a directory\nis it's a bundle.\n\n516\n00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.460\nInside of this directory,\nthere might be five files.\n\n517\n00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.755\nThere might be 5,000 files.\n\n518\n00:24:39.755 --> 00:24:42.240\nIt's all the files this application needs\n\n519\n00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.920\nbundled together in\na nice little assembly.\n\n520\n00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.680\nIt's not necessarily every file it needs.\n\n521\n00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.920\nWe'll talk about frameworks later, but\nthe bulk of what it needs is right here.\n\n522\n00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.380\nIn the UI, I don't see that.\n\n523\n00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.550\nWhen I browse into my hard drive\nwhich apparently I can't do,\n\n524\n00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.580\nand then we find Cyberduck, and we\ndouble click on it, it runs the program.\n\n525\n00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.620\nBut in reality, there is a folder.\n\n526\n00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.431\nSo the default is that when you\nhave a file that ends in .app or\n\n527\n00:25:05.431 --> 00:25:09.160\na folder that ends in .app,\nand you double click on it,\n\n528\n00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:14.910\nMac OS looks inside of it for the program\nto run, and it knows where to look.\n\n529\n00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:18.380\nIf you right click on an application,\nyou can choose.\n\n530\n00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.620\nNotice how I've got open.\n\n531\n00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.380\nThat's the default.\n\n532\n00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.040\nIt's gonna run the program.\n\n533\n00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:27.760\nOr I can choose Show Package Contents\nwhich means don't run the program,\n\n534\n00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.940\nopen it like a folder.\n\n535\n00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.000\nAnd if I choose Show Package Contents,\nI get a folder,\n\n536\n00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.790\nand there's a folder in there called\nContents, and there might be one or more.\n\n537\n00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.270\nSometimes you'll see several\nfolders like Resources and so on.\n\n538\n00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:42.850\nAnd if browse in the contents,\nactually there is Resources, Library,\n\n539\n00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.160\nFrameworks, .CodeSignature, MacOS.\n\n540\n00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.080\nI've got Pkginfo and\ninfo.plist, a preferences list.\n\n541\n00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.100\nThis is all information about the program\nitself, and if I start browsing into\n\n542\n00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:59.190\nthese, you can find here in MacOS,\nthere's the actual Cyberduck program.\n\n543\n00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:04.060\nWhen I run this .app folder, it knows to\nlook in here, look in the contents folder,\n\n544\n00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.980\nlook in the MacOS folder,\nand find the real program.\n\n545\n00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.885\nBut it's packaged with something else.\n\n546\n00:26:08.885 --> 00:26:11.010\nRuntime.jre.\n\n547\n00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.740\nCyberduck is written in Java.\n\n548\n00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:17.090\nWell, I hate Java, and so\nI don't have Java installed on my machine.\n\n549\n00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.880\nSo I can't run Cyberduck, right?\n\n550\n00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.650\nWell, you saw me run it a minute ago.\n\n551\n00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:22.150\nIt ran just fine.\n\n552\n00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:23.690\nMaybe I've got Java installed.\n\n553\n00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:24.520\nWell, we can find that out.\n\n554\n00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.390\nIf I go into my System Preferences, when\nyou install the Java Runtime Environment,\n\n555\n00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.600\nit creates a other extension.\n\n556\n00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.740\nRemember your System Preferences\nare divided into five areas.\n\n557\n00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.430\nAnd so when I look in here,\nI see the personal area up top.\n\n558\n00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:43.470\nI see the hardware second, I see network\nand internet third, and then I see the,\n\n559\n00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.540\nwhat's the last one called, system, system\nlast, and then after that I see other.\n\n560\n00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.540\nWell, I don't have an other section, and\n\n561\n00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:53.440\nthat's where Java would appear, and\nI don't have Java on this system.\n\n562\n00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.090\nWell, Cyberduck needs it.\n\n563\n00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.570\nAnd so\nthey've packaged Java with Cyberduck.\n\n564\n00:26:58.570 --> 00:26:59.640\nNow I know what you're thinking.\n\n565\n00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.640\nWait a minuteDon, you hate Java.\n\n566\n00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.250\nYou're gonna run this program?\n\n567\n00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.670\nAren't you weakening the security?\n\n568\n00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:08.770\nWell, when you run an application,\nMac OS creates what's called a sandbox.\n\n569\n00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:11.360\nThe application is not allowed to\ninteract with other applications.\n\n570\n00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.059\nIt's only allowed to interact with itself.\n\n571\n00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:18.980\nAnd so when it runs, it needs Java,\nso they've packaged Java with it.\n\n572\n00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.920\nAnd so when Cyberduck runs,\nit can use Java, and\n\n573\n00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.670\nrun it, and I don't have to\nworry about Java going crazy and\n\n574\n00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.860\nopening up the rest of my\nsystem to vulnerabilities.\n\n575\n00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.440\nIt would just be Cyberduck\nthat would be vulnerable.\n\n576\n00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.610\nIt's in its own little sandbox,\nits own protected environment.\n\n577\n00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.800\nAnd to achieve that,\nthey had to package it together.\n\n578\n00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.230\nAnd so as I browse into here,\nI can find the Java Runtime environment or\n\n579\n00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:45.410\nits libraries all attached and\na part of it.\n\n580\n00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:46.900\nAnd it could even be another application.\n\n581\n00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.820\nNotice how this Java Runtime here.\n\n582\n00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.100\nIt's got its own MacOS folder.\n\n583\n00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.190\nSo it could have binaries\nthat are tucked away.\n\n584\n00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.320\nThis one doesn't.\n\n585\n00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.325\n>> Now, Don, really quickly.\n\n586\n00:27:54.325 --> 00:27:57.810\n[COUGH] If you had Java,\nlet's say I got crazy.\n\n587\n00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.670\nI'm just been kicking around\nin this Cyberduck program.\n\n588\n00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.220\nLet's say I hate Java, and\nI'd delete it, but for whatever reason,\n\n589\n00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.730\nI have Java installed as\nwell outside of Cyberduck.\n\n590\n00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:08.690\nWould it be able to use my Java,\n\n591\n00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:12.830\nor does it have to be packaged in\nthere because it is that bundle?\n\n592\n00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:14.840\n>> In this case, it would break it,\nit wouldn't work.\n\n593\n00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:19.290\nAnd it's because the developer\nexpects Java to be part of the app.\n\n594\n00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:20.252\nand now it's not, right?\n\n595\n00:28:20.252 --> 00:28:24.530\nSo they're not looking for it to exist\noutside, so it's not going to run.\n\n596\n00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.420\nIf they wrote the app to look for it\noutside, then that would be different, but\n\n597\n00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.940\nmost vendors have stopped doing that cuz\nthey know people aren't installing Java\n\n598\n00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.200\nanymore, and I'm really bad about it now.\n\n599\n00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.320\nIf I see an app that requires Java,\nand I just want to install it,\n\n600\n00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.410\nI'll go find an alternate app.\n\n601\n00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:39.100\nBut they're saying, well, let's just\npackage it inside, so people don't see it.\n\n602\n00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.070\nAnd they'll continue to run it,\nand that happens.\n\n603\n00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:44.870\nWhat you could do though,\nis I could delete it out of there, and\n\n604\n00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:48.620\nthen I could do links to my\nexisting job environment.\n\n605\n00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.050\nAnd that way, it could run and\npull from it.\n\n606\n00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.360\nBut I'd have to create those links,\nif they're not there, it's not gonna work.\n\n607\n00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.720\nSo that is kind of a side effect of that.\n\n608\n00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.800\nNow when you download an app,\nthat's how it's normally going to come,\n\n609\n00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.370\nas just a program, and\nyou've got to drag and drop.\n\n610\n00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.330\nNow I say it's how it normally comes.\n\n611\n00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.440\nYou might not see it that way, right?\n\n612\n00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.360\nSo, for example,\n\n613\n00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:11.430\nif I go back to my downloads folder here,\nI downloaded a few things before the show.\n\n614\n00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.300\nCyberduck was one of them.\n\n615\n00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.370\nAnd Cyberduck,\nyou just downloaded the .app file.\n\n616\n00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:16.180\nDragged it and dropped it,\nand that was the end of it.\n\n617\n00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:20.640\nBut I also downloaded Google Chrome, and\nGoogle Chrome is a dmg or a disk image.\n\n618\n00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.630\nWell, if I open up googlechrome.dmg,\nit's gonna mount that disk image, and so\n\n619\n00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:30.130\nI'll see a new icon up here on my desktop\nover here as soon as it's done verifying.\n\n620\n00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:31.219\nI can skip the verify.\n\n621\n00:29:31.219 --> 00:29:34.010\n[LAUGH] And so,\nonce it's mounted, there we go.\n\n622\n00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:35.660\nSo it mounts it,\nshows it as a removable drive.\n\n623\n00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.420\nAnd it's just asking me\nto drag Google Chrome and\n\n624\n00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.930\ndrop it to my applications folder, right?\n\n625\n00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:45.060\nI'm dragging googlechrome.app and\ndropping in to my applications folder.\n\n626\n00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:51.400\nIf I go back to my terminal window,\nI can jump in to the volumes folder.\n\n627\n00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.670\nAnd I'll see that Google Chrome DMG\nfile is now mounted.\n\n628\n00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:02.450\nAnd if I browse inside of it, there's\nthe Google Chrome.app that I dragged and\n\n629\n00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.230\ndropped into my applications folder.\n\n630\n00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:09.240\nAnd if I browse into that, it is just\na folder, and it's got a contents folder,\n\n631\n00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.870\nand it's got everything inside of it\nthat it needs including the MacOS folder\n\n632\n00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:16.240\nwhich is where the real program resides.\n\n633\n00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:21.547\nAnd so there's the actual Google Chrome\nbrowser nested inside of that .app file,\n\n634\n00:30:21.547 --> 00:30:22.180\nright?\n\n635\n00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:26.590\nThat's how most applications are going\nto work, is you just have the .app file.\n\n636\n00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.310\nEverything that program needs\nis self contained, you drag, and\n\n637\n00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.150\nyou drop it, and that's it.\n\n638\n00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:32.690\nBut there are exceptions.\n\n639\n00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:35.480\nSome programs need more.\n\n640\n00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.730\nSome programs interact with your hardware.\n\n641\n00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:40.470\nAnd if they interact with your hardware,\nthey may need to install drivers.\n\n642\n00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:44.020\nThey may need to install\nsome system functionality.\n\n643\n00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.250\nAnd that can't reside in\nthe applications folder.\n\n644\n00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:47.700\nIt's gotta reside over\nin the systems folder.\n\n645\n00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.570\nIt's gotta put data in other\nplaces on the hard drive, and\n\n646\n00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:51.880\na normal application is\nnot allowed to do that.\n\n647\n00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.310\nRemember how I said we've got sandboxes.\n\n648\n00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:57.310\nThese things are being walled off and\nprotected in their own little environment.\n\n649\n00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:59.260\nWhat if they need to write somewhere else?\n\n650\n00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.420\nThey can't.\n\n651\n00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.120\nWell, for that you won't get a .app file.\n\n652\n00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.980\nInstead you'll get a .pkg.\n\n653\n00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.650\nAnd what a .pkg is it's a package file.\n\n654\n00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:10.990\nAnd a package file contains a lot\nmore than just an application, and\n\n655\n00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.570\nlet me show you.\n\n656\n00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:15.240\nI've got one that I downloaded before\nthe show, which was VirtualBox.\n\n657\n00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.110\nSo VirtualBox, if you've never heard\nof it, it's a visualization software.\n\n658\n00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.360\nIt lets you run virtual machines.\n\n659\n00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:25.180\nSo I could run Windows on top of MacOS,\nor I could run Linux on top of MacOS and\n\n660\n00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.110\nstill have my in tact\noperating system beneath it.\n\n661\n00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.660\nIt's kinda fun.\n\n662\n00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.480\nI use these things in\nthe show all the time.\n\n663\n00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.180\nIf I need two or three workstations,\nI can whip them up as virtual machines.\n\n664\n00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.500\nWell when you install VirtualBox,\nit has to install\n\n665\n00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:40.380\nhardware drivers to allow the virtual\nmachines to see your network adapters, and\n\n666\n00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.400\nyour wireless network, and\nall those other good things.\n\n667\n00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.220\nSo it's gotta do a lot more\nthan just create a .app file.\n\n668\n00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:49.450\nWell if I mount the DMG for VirtualBox,\nI'm gonna get that one connected.\n\n669\n00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:56.600\nAnd I open it up, it doesn't have a drag\nme to the applications folder and drop it.\n\n670\n00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.562\nIt has a PKG file.\n\n671\n00:31:58.562 --> 00:32:00.554\nAnd PKGs are packages.\n\n672\n00:32:00.554 --> 00:32:01.326\nThey're a package.\n\n673\n00:32:01.326 --> 00:32:02.590\nThey've got the application.\n\n674\n00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.946\nThere is a .app inside of there, right?\n\n675\n00:32:04.946 --> 00:32:07.439\nBut there's also a series of scripts and\n\n676\n00:32:07.439 --> 00:32:11.850\nother files that need to be copied\noutside of the Applications folder.\n\n677\n00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:15.327\nSo it's an automated installer\nthat tells the system what to do.\n\n678\n00:32:15.327 --> 00:32:18.890\nAnd when you run a package file,\nyou gotta be an administrator.\n\n679\n00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:21.560\nWhen I dragged Google Chrome and\ndropped it in my Applications folder,\n\n680\n00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.230\ndid it prompt me for a password?\n\n681\n00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.970\nNo.\n\n682\n00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.790\nWhen I ran it,\ndid it prompt me for a password?\n\n683\n00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:26.560\nNo.\n\n684\n00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.710\nAll it did was tell me, hey,\nyou downloaded this from the Internet,\n\n685\n00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.080\nare you sure you want to run it?\n\n686\n00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.590\nWhen I run this .pkg file,\n\n687\n00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:36.040\nI'm gonna double click on it and\nit's gonna tell me it's gonna install.\n\n688\n00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:41.180\nAnd as it moves forward on the installer,\nit's gonna ask me for\n\n689\n00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.900\nmy password, I gotta be the administrator.\n\n690\n00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.710\nCuz I'm not just writing\nto the Applications folder.\n\n691\n00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.190\nNow I'm writing outside.\n\n692\n00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:48.830\nAnd I've gotta have permission to do that.\n\n693\n00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:52.270\nIt's got more data than just a .app file.\n\n694\n00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:55.680\n>> So these aren't sandboxed\nlike the apps that were before.\n\n695\n00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.490\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n696\n00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:59.340\nI mean, technically the app is still\nsandboxed, but it doesn't matter cuz it's\n\n697\n00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.720\ngot access to the underlying system,\nwhich means it can bypass the sandbox.\n\n698\n00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.125\n>> So it's a sifty sandbox.\n\n699\n00:33:04.125 --> 00:33:07.530\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's more of a guideline, and\n\n700\n00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:08.750\nlike a suggestion.\n\n701\n00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.910\nLet me suggest you don't\nmess with the other apps.\n\n702\n00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.970\nSo when that installs,\nthat's a good bit different, right?\n\n703\n00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:18.750\nAnd if I drop back to my file system, and\nI go into my applications folder, and\n\n704\n00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:21.350\nI browse around in here, okay.\n\n705\n00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:26.330\nI can see way up here,\nhere's Google Chrome, right.\n\n706\n00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.210\nAnd so Google Chrome,\nI dragged and dropped it and\n\n707\n00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:29.790\nit shows it is being owned by me.\n\n708\n00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:31.860\nIt's a directory, there it is.\n\n709\n00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:36.810\nAnd if I look down here, somewhere,\nI can find VirtualBox and\n\n710\n00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:38.720\nnotice who VirtualBox is owned by?\n\n711\n00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.170\nNot dpezet, it's owned by root.\n\n712\n00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:44.025\nWhen it installed,\nit installed as the system account.\n\n713\n00:33:44.025 --> 00:33:47.018\nIt's got a lot more access than\nan application owned by dpezet.\n\n714\n00:33:47.018 --> 00:33:49.520\nAll right, if it's owned by me,\nit has the same permissions as me.\n\n715\n00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.810\nIf it's owned by root,\nit has full access to the system.\n\n716\n00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.270\nIt can bypass the sandbox.\n\n717\n00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:55.490\nAnd it's still a directory.\n\n718\n00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.080\nIt's still a .app file.\n\n719\n00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.430\nIf I were to browse inside of it,\nI'll see that.\n\n720\n00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:03.860\nSo if I browse into Applications and\nI find VirtualBox in the list,\n\n721\n00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.686\nI can right-click on it and\ndo Show Package Contents.\n\n722\n00:34:06.686 --> 00:34:11.402\nAnd now I've got the Contents folder and\nI've got the MacOS folder, and holy moly,\n\n723\n00:34:11.402 --> 00:34:15.180\nthere is a lot more in here than\njust one application, right?\n\n724\n00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:21.564\nSo in here somewhere, somewhere in here,\nhere we go is the VirtualBox service.\n\n725\n00:34:21.564 --> 00:34:24.350\nThat's what runs in the background,\nthat's what the system is going to run.\n\n726\n00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:27.800\nAnd then somewhere in here is the user\ninterface, which is this guy right here,\n\n727\n00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.820\nthe VirtualBox user interface.\n\n728\n00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:34.090\nEach of these are individual programs that\nmake up a part of this bigger program.\n\n729\n00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:37.680\nAnd it's copied additional files into\nmy system libraries and other places.\n\n730\n00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.580\nSo it's done a lot more than\na typical program, all right?\n\n731\n00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:46.300\nSo these are all different kinds of files\nthat we might see on our system, and\n\n732\n00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.820\nI know I talked about aliases,\n\n733\n00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:51.420\nwhich are kind of like\na miniature tracking database.\n\n734\n00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:55.450\nWe talked about hard links and soft links,\nwhich aren't real files, they're pointers.\n\n735\n00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:58.310\nAnd then we talked about applications and\nthe bundles and\n\n736\n00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:01.430\nthe packages that are part of those and\nhow they really break the rules.\n\n737\n00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:02.740\nThey're not a single file anymore.\n\n738\n00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.630\nThey're a directory and\nthere's a ton of stuff inside of them.\n\n739\n00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.950\nSo those are all different types of\nfiles that we'll get exposed to as we\n\n740\n00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:08.830\nwork with Mac OS.\n\n741\n00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:11.400\n>> Well Don, I don't know about our\nviewers, but I'm sure they would agree,\n\n742\n00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.740\nlike myself, I could listen to you\nwax eloquent about this all day long.\n\n743\n00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:20.140\nBut I'm looking at our clock, and\nit's definitely expired in its time.\n\n744\n00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.250\nWe'll have to do another part two,\n\n745\n00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:25.290\ncuz I know you've got plenty more to talk\nabout when it comes to files themselves.\n\n746\n00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:26.780\n>> Yeah, I focused on files this time.\n\n747\n00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.740\nI wanna talk more about folders in\nthe next episode, so stay tuned for that,\n\n748\n00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.150\ncuz we're gonna take a look at some of\nthe different folders that are present.\n\n749\n00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:35.340\nSome are system folders, some are hidden\nfolders, and kinda how they work, so\n\n750\n00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:39.060\nwe've got a little bit of that to see and\na bit more on those extensions.\n\n751\n00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.620\nI know I mentioned frameworks but\ndidn't get into it, and\n\n752\n00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.650\nI wanna tackle those two, so\ndefinitely stay tuned for those.\n\n753\n00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:43.420\n>> Yeah, that'll be awesome.\n\n754\n00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.650\nHopefully, you guys will enjoy that.\n\n755\n00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:45.840\nDon, thanks for stopping by.\n\n756\n00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.940\nWe look forward to seeing you in part two.\n\n757\n00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.470\nHopefully, we'll see you there as well.\n\n758\n00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.610\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n759\n00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:53.440\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n760\n00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.240\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n761\n00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.480\n>> We'll see you

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.853\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and today's\nepisode we're continuing on with our\n\n4\n00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.311\nApple Certified Support\nProfessional Series.\n\n5\n00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:27.454\nJoining us back in the studio again today,\nnone other than our good friend and\n\n6\n00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:28.868\nmentor, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:28.868 --> 00:00:30.280\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.170\n>> Thanks for having me back, Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.740\nReady to jump right back into\nthe Certified Support Professional.\n\n10\n00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.426\nAnd in this episode we're kinda continuing\non from what we saw in the last episode.\n\n11\n00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:41.474\nWe were talking about files, and\nwe got a chance to see aliases and\n\n12\n00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:44.468\nlinks, symbolic links, hard links,\nall that good stuff, and\n\n13\n00:00:44.468 --> 00:00:46.790\nkinda tinker around\na bit with those files.\n\n14\n00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.753\nThere's a few other special types\nof files that I wanna talk about.\n\n15\n00:00:49.753 --> 00:00:51.910\nAnd actually,\nI guess I should stop saying files,\n\n16\n00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.690\ncuz there's really some special folders\nthat I wanna talk about in this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.780\nAnd again, these are things that your\naverage end user's really not gonna care\n\n18\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.530\nabout, a lot of it's hidden from them.\n\n19\n00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.780\nBut for us as administrators, as support\nprofessionals, we have to deal with it.\n\n20\n00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.580\nSo, let's dive in, and\ntake a look at those.\n\n21\n00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.880\nNow, for your average end user experience,\nright, so\n\n22\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.110\nI've got a stock install of El Capitan,\nwhatever it was, this is fired up here.\n\n23\n00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.890\nAnd for your average end user,\n\n24\n00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.270\ntheir world kind of just rotates\naround their home directory.\n\n25\n00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.155\nWhen they fire up the Finder, the Finder\nstarts with All My Files, and All My Files\n\n26\n00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:26.880\nis showing them, well, all of their\nfiles that are in their home directory.\n\n27\n00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.690\nSo, in their Downloads,\ntheir Documents, their Desktop, and\n\n28\n00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.080\nit can get littered pretty fast.\n\n29\n00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.200\nBut, they can go over here and\nsay, just show me my Desktop, or\n\n30\n00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.860\njust show me my Documents,\njust show me my Downloads.\n\n31\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.257\nAll of these folders exist\nin their profile, and\n\n32\n00:01:39.257 --> 00:01:41.430\nwe've seen the profile in other episodes.\n\n33\n00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.130\nIf you ever wanna see it,\nyou can go up here to your Go menu and\n\n34\n00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.723\nyou've got the Home option right there.\n\n35\n00:01:47.723 --> 00:01:50.855\nSo they can go to their Home and\nhere's their Home folder where they've got\n\n36\n00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:53.452\nDesktops, Documents, Downloads,\nthose three main ones.\n\n37\n00:01:53.452 --> 00:01:56.283\nNow they've also got Movies,\nMusic, Pictures, and Public and\n\n38\n00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:58.850\nwe've talked about those\nin other episodes also.\n\n39\n00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.000\nBut these are just places for\nthem to store their stuff, right?\n\n40\n00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.800\nBut these are a little bit special,\nthese are system folders.\n\n41\n00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.867\nI mean they're not part of\nthe underlying operating system,\n\n42\n00:02:07.867 --> 00:02:09.330\nthey're part of the user profile.\n\n43\n00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.600\nBut I know they're special because\nthey have little pictures on them.\n\n44\n00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.780\nIf I make a folder, so I decide I wanna\ncreate a folder called TopSecret, right?\n\n45\n00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.380\nThis is where I'm gonna\nstore all my awesome stuff.\n\n46\n00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.980\nIt's just a folder and\nit's blue and that's it.\n\n47\n00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.780\nThere's no special camera or\nmusic symbol or anything like that on it,\n\n48\n00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.840\njust a regular old folder.\n\n49\n00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.880\nSo that's one way that we kinda spot\nthat these folders are special,\n\n50\n00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.570\nthey're different.\n\n51\n00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.980\nThey're created by the operating system\nand there's many that are like that,\n\n52\n00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.280\nsome we see, some we don't see.\n\n53\n00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.397\nSo some of them are not present,\nfor example, if a user installs\n\n54\n00:02:42.397 --> 00:02:46.292\nan application, they may not want the\napplication to be visible to everybody.\n\n55\n00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:50.193\nMaybe they want the application\njust to be visible to them, right?\n\n56\n00:02:50.193 --> 00:02:54.833\nIf you wanna do that, you can create\nan Applications folder in your own profile\n\n57\n00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:58.240\nand when you do that,\nsee what happened there?\n\n58\n00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.915\nWhen I made TopSecrets,\nit just was a blue folder.\n\n59\n00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:05.688\nBut when I made that Application folder,\nit got the pretty little pencils, or\n\n60\n00:03:05.688 --> 00:03:08.160\nwhatever, to let me know that\nit's an application folder.\n\n61\n00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.750\nThe operating system recognized it,\nand said hey, I'm ready for\n\n62\n00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.200\nyou to start throwing apps in here.\n\n63\n00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.840\nSo it's special, it didn't exist,\nI had to make it.\n\n64\n00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.634\nThere's other ones that do exist that\nwe just can't see, so for example,\n\n65\n00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:19.730\nthe Library folder.\n\n66\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.023\nEverybody has a Library folder that stores\nall of their preferences and settings,\n\n67\n00:03:23.023 --> 00:03:24.750\nthe application support stuff.\n\n68\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.882\nBut we don't see it,\nit is here if I go over to my Go menu and\n\n69\n00:03:28.882 --> 00:03:34.414\nI choose Go to Folder, right, where I\ncan manually type in a folder to go to.\n\n70\n00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:42.564\nI can type it in and\nI can say go to /Users/dpezet/Library.\n\n71\n00:03:42.564 --> 00:03:47.210\nI didn't see that a minute ago, but\nwhen I browse to it now, there it is.\n\n72\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.260\nI'm browsing into it and if I turn on my,\nwhere's that pathbar thing?\n\n73\n00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.985\nThere we go, and look at my pathbar, I'm\nin Users, dpezet, I'm in my Home folder,\n\n74\n00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.903\nand then I'm in a Library folder.\n\n75\n00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:01.870\nA folder that wasn't visible a second ago,\nit exists, it's just hidden.\n\n76\n00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.594\nCuz your average user doesn't\nneed to dink around in there.\n\n77\n00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:07.353\nIf you start messing around in there,\nyou can break programs,\n\n78\n00:04:07.353 --> 00:04:10.910\nyou can lose your preferences, go back\nto default settings for an application.\n\n79\n00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.500\nYou can do all sorts of stuff\nthat you're not supposed to do.\n\n80\n00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.065\n>> That's my favorite place\nto delete files, Don.\n\n81\n00:04:15.065 --> 00:04:16.631\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n82\n00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:17.651\nI prefer the system folder personally.\n\n83\n00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:19.797\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\nthat's a good one as well.\n\n84\n00:04:19.797 --> 00:04:24.143\n>> So usually the stuff where people\ncan do damage is hidden away from them.\n\n85\n00:04:24.143 --> 00:04:26.310\nAll right, so\nlet's talk about hiding files.\n\n86\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.810\nHow do we hide stuff?\n\n87\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.050\nWell there's two different ways\nwe can hide things in Mac OS.\n\n88\n00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.180\nNow it hides things for you,\nthings like that Library folder, and\n\n89\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.500\nsome of them are hidden in plain sight.\n\n90\n00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.000\nLike that Library folder,\nit exists, you can get to it,\n\n91\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000\nyou just have to know how to get to it.\n\n92\n00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.980\nIn fact, there's an even easier way,\nin your Go menu.\n\n93\n00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.350\nWhen I go into the Go menu, I see all this\nstuff, notice how Library is not in there.\n\n94\n00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.070\nIf I hold down Option on my keyboard,\nlook what appears.\n\n95\n00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.930\nLibrary, I got lucky and\nmy mouse was right in the right spot.\n\n96\n00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So [LAUGH] so you can see it appears.\n\n97\n00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.710\nSo an end user can find their\nLibrary folder if they want with\n\n98\n00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.320\njust hitting that little Option key and\nthey can get there, right.\n\n99\n00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.298\nBut other folders are hidden in a way\nwhere they really can't get to them unless\n\n100\n00:05:06.298 --> 00:05:08.540\nthey know that they're there, all right.\n\n101\n00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.880\nNow how do we hide a folder?\n\n102\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.115\nLet's say my TopSecret folder, right,\nwhich I think I called TopSecrets,\n\n103\n00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:14.500\nlet's just call it TopSecret.\n\n104\n00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.330\nSo I'm gonna rename that, just to\nmake it a little easier on myself and\n\n105\n00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.220\nI'm gonna call it TopSecret.\n\n106\n00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.230\nAnd I wanna hide that, I don't want\njust anybody browsing and finding it.\n\n107\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.087\nIn fact, maybe I'll stick it on my desktop\nwhere normally it'd be really obvious.\n\n108\n00:05:27.087 --> 00:05:30.111\nIf somebody is walking by and they look\nover my shoulder and they see TopSecret\n\n109\n00:05:30.111 --> 00:05:32.736\nright there on my desktop,\nI wanna hide that so they can't see it.\n\n110\n00:05:32.736 --> 00:05:36.640\nWell, there's no really good way to do\nthat from the graphic user interface,\n\n111\n00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.440\nit doesn't give us a hide\nthis thing type option.\n\n112\n00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.110\nBut we can do it from the Terminal.\n\n113\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.200\nIf I fire up my Terminal and I browse\nto my Desktop, and I pull up a listing.\n\n114\n00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.209\nSo I'm just gonna run ls,\nand pull up a listing,\n\n115\n00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:50.473\nthere's that TopSecret folder right there,\nright?\n\n116\n00:05:50.473 --> 00:05:52.903\nAnd ls -la will show that it is a folder,\nand\n\n117\n00:05:52.903 --> 00:05:57.610\nthen I've got the little d attribute right\nthere, so I know it's that, all right?\n\n118\n00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.853\nBut the point is, when somebody\npulls a listing they see TopSecret.\n\n119\n00:06:00.853 --> 00:06:06.146\nNow if I wanna hide it, I can use\na little UNIX command called chflags,\n\n120\n00:06:06.146 --> 00:06:10.917\nchange flags, and I can change\nthe hidden flag on that folder.\n\n121\n00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:15.671\nI can say chflags hidden and\nthen I can point to what I wanna hide, and\n\n122\n00:06:15.671 --> 00:06:18.780\nI wanna hide that TopSecret folder, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.900\nSo I just changed it and\nadded the hidden flag to it.\n\n124\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.366\nAnd when you look at my desktop,\nI don't see TopSecret anymore.\n\n125\n00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:32.340\nIf I fire up the Finder and I browse to\nmy Desktop, I don't see it, it's hidden.\n\n126\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.440\nOkay, but it is there,\nit does exist, right?\n\n127\n00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.939\nI can go to my Go menu,\nI can choose Go to Folder, and\n\n128\n00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:42.724\nI can type in ~/Desktop/TopSecret/.\n\n129\n00:06:42.724 --> 00:06:46.799\nAnd I guess you guys can't really see\nthis, but I used tab auto-complete and\n\n130\n00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:50.530\nit even tab auto-completed it for\nme, if I just do T and hit Tab.\n\n131\n00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.719\nSo it knows the folder is there, but in\norder to get to it, you have to know that\n\n132\n00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:58.206\nit's there, to come in and\ntype the command and browse into it.\n\n133\n00:06:58.206 --> 00:07:00.399\nAnd now once you're in there you\ncan start saving your documents,\n\n134\n00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:01.467\nmaking whatever it is you need.\n\n135\n00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:04.910\nBut your applications are not going\nto see that, right, it is hidden.\n\n136\n00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.190\nAnd if you wanna unhide it,\nyou just change the flag.\n\n137\n00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.400\nAnd you make the flag nohidden, and\n\n138\n00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.070\nthen miraculously it reappears right there\nin the background and it's visible again.\n\n139\n00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.620\nOkay, that's one way to hide files and\nfolders, and that's how the Library folder\n\n140\n00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.470\nis, the Library folder just\nhas the hidden flag set on it.\n\n141\n00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.830\nIt is there, but the end users don't\nsee it in the graphical user interface,\n\n142\n00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.460\nthat's what happens there.\n\n143\n00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.940\nSame thing goes for\nsome other special files in the system,\n\n144\n00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.160\nthey're just hidden like that so\npeople can't mess with it.\n\n145\n00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.990\nWhen I browse to the hard drive, right,\nso if I just browse into Macintosh HD,\n\n146\n00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:41.150\nI only see four folders, Applications,\nLibrary, System, Users, right?\n\n147\n00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.819\nBut if I do a listing from\nthe Macintosh HD, right?\n\n148\n00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:49.959\nSo if I browse into my hard drive,\nand I do an ls, I see Applications,\n\n149\n00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:54.747\nLibrary, Network, System,\nUsers, Volumes, bin, cores,\n\n150\n00:07:54.747 --> 00:07:58.587\ndev, etc., home, and\nall sorts of other stuff.\n\n151\n00:07:58.587 --> 00:08:01.885\nBut I don't see that in the UI cuz all\nthese other folders have that hidden flag\n\n152\n00:08:01.885 --> 00:08:04.800\nset so that we don't see them\nwhen we browse the hard drive.\n\n153\n00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.700\nSo that's one way to hide it.\n\n154\n00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.740\nThere is another way that's\na little less convenient,\n\n155\n00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.390\nit's the Unix way of hiding things.\n\n156\n00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:15.440\nAnd that is, any folder that starts\nwith a dot in the name is hidden.\n\n157\n00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.580\nSo if I go to my desktop,\nlet me just get back to my desktop.\n\n158\n00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:26.310\nAnd I wanna create another folder that is,\nmaybe it's top secret also, right?\n\n159\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.400\nWell actually here,\n\n160\n00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.620\nyou can see my TopSecret file\nright there on the desktop, right?\n\n161\n00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:37.040\nIf I take it and rename it, so right now\nI see it as just plain old TopSecret.\n\n162\n00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.580\nI'm gonna move TopSecret, and\nI'm gonna change its name\n\n163\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.200\nto .TopSecret.\n\n164\n00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.995\nSee I'm adding that dot,\nwhat is my mouse doing?\n\n165\n00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:50.550\nI'm losing control of the mouse,\nthere we go.\n\n166\n00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.970\nI'm just adding a little dot to\nthe beginning of the name, okay.\n\n167\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:59.480\nSo when I do that,\nI still have a folder called TopSecret,\n\n168\n00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.190\nbut it starts with a period.\n\n169\n00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.170\nAnd in the Unix world, anything that\nstarts with a period is hidden by default.\n\n170\n00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.860\nSo when I ran ls,\nI don't see TopSecret anymore.\n\n171\n00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.800\nAnd when I look at my desktop,\nI don't see TopSecret there either, but\n\n172\n00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.060\nit does still exist,\nit just has a dot at the beginning of it.\n\n173\n00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.111\nInstead of messing around with Unix flags,\nwe can just rename the file, and\n\n174\n00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:19.694\nput a dot.\n\n175\n00:09:19.694 --> 00:09:23.810\nAnd it works for files as well as folders,\nso you can hide them that way too.\n\n176\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.450\nAnd this is used a lot by the system, so\nfor example, looking in my home directory,\n\n177\n00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.950\nlet's see what I've got\nin my home directory.\n\n178\n00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.940\nI got a bunch of folders in here.\n\n179\n00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.450\nIf I use SSH, the secure shell protocol,\nto remote and connect to something,\n\n180\n00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.580\nit stores a copy of the public\nencryption keys that you use and\n\n181\n00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.480\nstores them in your profile.\n\n182\n00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.820\nBut that's not something a regular\nend user needs to mess with and so\n\n183\n00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.910\nit hides them.\n\n184\n00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.270\nSo if I do, well,\nlooking here at my home directory,\n\n185\n00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:53.380\nnotice how there's no SSH files in here,\nthere's nothing related to SSH.\n\n186\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.575\nBut if I connect to a host, so\nlet me see, who can I SSH into today?\n\n187\n00:09:57.575 --> 00:10:03.254\nLet's do,\nWe'll find something on the network.\n\n188\n00:10:03.254 --> 00:10:04.830\nThere's gotta be something out there.\n\n189\n00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.330\nSo I'm gonna remote into,\nhere we go, perfect,\n\n190\n00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.020\nI'm gonna remote into this switch.\n\n191\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.180\nAnd when I go to connect to it, see how\nit's showing me this key fingerprint?\n\n192\n00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.900\nThat's a certificate and it's going to\nconnect and it's going to let me log in,\n\n193\n00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.820\nassuming I know the password.\n\n194\n00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.380\nThere we go, and I'm able to log in and\nI'm now connected to this switch.\n\n195\n00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.100\nI used SSH, I'm connected to the switch.\n\n196\n00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.510\nWhen I get out, now I'm out, and\n\n197\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.990\nthe next time that I SSH in,\nit doesn't complain about the certificate.\n\n198\n00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.020\nBecause it already knows\nthe certificate's okay,\n\n199\n00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.040\nit already knows that I trust this one.\n\n200\n00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.750\nNow how does it know that?\n\n201\n00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.920\nWell, it knows it because it\nstored the certificate and\n\n202\n00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.620\nit's storing here in my home folder.\n\n203\n00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.704\nNow I don't see anything different here,\nbut\n\n204\n00:10:44.704 --> 00:10:48.240\nif I do an ls -la,\nI now have a .ssh folder.\n\n205\n00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.160\nAnd if I go into .ssh and look,\nI've got a file called known_hosts.\n\n206\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.610\nAnd if I take a look at that known_hosts\nfolder, there is an RSA encryption key.\n\n207\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.080\nRight, it's the public key, and\nit's got it stored right here.\n\n208\n00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.720\nSo the next time I connect to that host,\nI expect to see the same key.\n\n209\n00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.530\nIf I get a different key, I might\nnot be connecting to the right host.\n\n210\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.210\nIt might be a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n211\n00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.730\nAnd it's stored right here in\na way your end users don't see it.\n\n212\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.840\nAnd it's doing that with\na folder called .ssh,\n\n213\n00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.220\njust adding that dot to\nthe beginning of it.\n\n214\n00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.920\nSo more than one way to hide files.\n\n215\n00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.528\nAnd you'll see these frequently\nwith system activities,\n\n216\n00:11:19.528 --> 00:11:21.677\nstuff that we don't\nnormally have to mess with.\n\n217\n00:11:21.677 --> 00:11:25.848\n>> So this just is basically a safety\nprecaution to keep the user from getting\n\n218\n00:11:25.848 --> 00:11:28.215\ncurious and going what can I do here?\n\n219\n00:11:28.215 --> 00:11:32.005\nYou kind of mess around, and then your\nsystems hosed because you've, like Don and\n\n220\n00:11:32.005 --> 00:11:35.418\nI were kind of joking around about,\ndeleting things from the system file or\n\n221\n00:11:35.418 --> 00:11:37.420\nthe hidden stuff that they hide.\n\n222\n00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.500\n>> Users to crazy things.\n\n223\n00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.150\n>> They do.\n>> Honestly, it's not always their fault.\n\n224\n00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.051\nIf you say, this is your home directory,\nyou can do whatever you want with it, and\n\n225\n00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:44.459\nusers are gonna do whatever they want.\n\n226\n00:11:44.459 --> 00:11:45.562\nThey're like well, it's my home directory.\n\n227\n00:11:45.562 --> 00:11:47.988\nI don't know what this Library folder is,\nlet me just delete that.\n\n228\n00:11:47.988 --> 00:11:49.265\nI hate libraries, I'm not gonna read.\n\n229\n00:11:49.265 --> 00:11:50.679\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I got a Documents folder,\n\n230\n00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:52.050\nwhat do I need a library for?\n\n231\n00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.610\nWell all right, their power.\n\n232\n00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.398\nSo if they delete it,\nit is gonna get recreated by the system.\n\n233\n00:11:56.398 --> 00:11:58.246\nIt's just they'll lose\neverything that's inside it so\n\n234\n00:11:58.246 --> 00:11:59.638\nthey lose all their preferences and so on.\n\n235\n00:11:59.638 --> 00:12:01.750\n>> Someone one time did tell me,\nreading's dumb.\n\n236\n00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.620\n[LAUGH] I said okay [LAUGH].\n\n237\n00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.120\n>> You and I both know.\n\n238\n00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.350\nAll right, so\nthose are some examples right there.\n\n239\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.450\nLet's talk about some other system\nfolders that are important.\n\n240\n00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.260\nI keep mentioning this Library folder.\n\n241\n00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.540\nThe Library folder's really important.\n\n242\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.690\nIt contains a number of things but the two\nmost critical things a Library folder\n\n243\n00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.310\nstores is it stores a folder\ncalled Application Support.\n\n244\n00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:26.202\nA lot of your programs need access\nto frameworks and library files and\n\n245\n00:12:26.202 --> 00:12:29.635\nother things that are required for\nthat application to run.\n\n246\n00:12:29.635 --> 00:12:32.110\nAnd it puts them in\nan Application Support folder.\n\n247\n00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.660\nIf the application is system-wide,\n\n248\n00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.690\nthere is a system-wide Library\nfolder that everyone shares.\n\n249\n00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.689\nBut there's a lot of tweaks and\nstuff that pertain to just you.\n\n250\n00:12:41.689 --> 00:12:46.730\nAnd if it just applies to you, you have\na Library folder in your own user account.\n\n251\n00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.680\nAnd the two kinda merge together.\n\n252\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.390\nYou've got the system Library folder and\nyour Library folder.\n\n253\n00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.470\nAnd when you run, your Library folder\ntakes precedence over that system one so\n\n254\n00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.710\nthat your preferences\ncan be unique to you.\n\n255\n00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.545\nBut a new user will get\nthose system preferences.\n\n256\n00:13:00.545 --> 00:13:02.190\nAnd same thing with libraries and so on,\n\n257\n00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.360\nso that you have things\nthat are unique to you.\n\n258\n00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.810\nWell, there's actually four\ndifferent Library folders.\n\n259\n00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.790\nEnd users never see this,\nend users see one Library folder.\n\n260\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.670\nBut there's actually four different ones.\n\n261\n00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.860\nAnd you'll see this a lot\nwith system folders,\n\n262\n00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.180\nthat Apple has what are called domains.\n\n263\n00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.750\nEvery system folder has a domain.\n\n264\n00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.220\nAnd there's one domain\nwhich is the user domain.\n\n265\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.040\nThis would be stuff that\nis just pertinent to me.\n\n266\n00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.069\nThen there's the local domain, and\n\n267\n00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:32.620\nthe local domain is stuff that's\npertinent to this local machine.\n\n268\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.131\nThere's the network domain,\n\n269\n00:13:34.131 --> 00:13:37.452\nthat's stuff that's pertinent to\nall the machines in my network.\n\n270\n00:13:37.452 --> 00:13:40.785\nIf I have an open directory or if I'm\nmanaging things with a profile manager,\n\n271\n00:13:40.785 --> 00:13:42.390\nthen I've got this network domain.\n\n272\n00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.890\nAnd then lastly you've\ngot the system domain.\n\n273\n00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.660\nAnd that's stuff that's pertinent to the\noperating system, that Apple decides and\n\n274\n00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.020\nyou're not supposed to mess with,\nit'd be really bad.\n\n275\n00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.440\nOkay, so\nwhen I talked about the Library folder and\n\n276\n00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.760\nI said there was four different Library\nfolders, there's a user one, a local one,\n\n277\n00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.190\na network one, and a system one, right?\n\n278\n00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.400\nLet's take a look at those here,\n\n279\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.800\nand I'm not gonna use the GUI\ncuz most of these are hidden.\n\n280\n00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.410\nSo I'm just gonna use the command line.\n\n281\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.930\nThe one that we spot the most often\nis the one that's in our own folder.\n\n282\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:17.530\nSo I've got a /Users/dpezet/Library,\nall right?\n\n283\n00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.550\nThat's the library for me,\nthat's the user domain library.\n\n284\n00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.700\nAnd inside of here,\nI'll see a ton of stuff.\n\n285\n00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.139\nAnd I singled out Application Support\ncuz that's probably the most important\n\n286\n00:14:28.139 --> 00:14:28.876\nfolder in here.\n\n287\n00:14:28.876 --> 00:14:33.240\nBut you'll see other ones like\nPreferences, that's pretty important too.\n\n288\n00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.030\nAs well as all this other stuff,\nKeyboard Layouts and Keychains and so on.\n\n289\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.990\nThey're all important too,\n\n290\n00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.290\njust not as important as\nthe other ones that I mentioned.\n\n291\n00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:46.630\nBut all of this stuff is been stored in\nhere and it's pertinent to me, my account.\n\n292\n00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:52.940\nIf I add a font, it's added for me if it\ngoes into this Font folder in my library.\n\n293\n00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.740\nBut if I add it into the big Font folder,\nthe one for the local machine,\n\n294\n00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.850\nit's added for every user.\n\n295\n00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:57.970\nThat's the difference.\n\n296\n00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:04.240\nSo this one, that I'm in right now, is\n/Users/whatever the user name is/Library.\n\n297\n00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:09.710\nBut if I just go into the root drive, just\nplain old /, and look around in there.\n\n298\n00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.606\nWell, there's a Library folder\nto be found here too, right.\n\n299\n00:15:13.606 --> 00:15:16.601\nAnd if I go into that Library folder and\ntake a look,\n\n300\n00:15:16.601 --> 00:15:19.000\nI'll see a lot of the same stuff.\n\n301\n00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.540\nIf I look in here I'll find Application\nSupport, I'll find Preferences.\n\n302\n00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.980\nBut these are system-wide.\n\n303\n00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.620\nThese are the local machine, the settings\nthat apply to this machine, all right?\n\n304\n00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.120\nSo that's another Library\nfolder that we've got.\n\n305\n00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.910\nAnd there's more than just that.\n\n306\n00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:38.430\nBut again, pulling up my path,\nthis is just /Library.\n\n307\n00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.570\nAll right, that's two of them.\n\n308\n00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:41.820\nThe next one was network.\n\n309\n00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.480\nThe network one is a little bit\nweird cuz you might not have it.\n\n310\n00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.832\nSo what you need to do is look\non your hard drive and look for\n\n311\n00:15:46.832 --> 00:15:47.913\na folder called Network.\n\n312\n00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:52.626\nSo I've got one, and if you into\nNetwork and take a look in there,\n\n313\n00:15:52.626 --> 00:15:54.356\nwell, mine's empty.\n\n314\n00:15:54.356 --> 00:15:55.944\nWhy is mine empty?\n\n315\n00:15:55.944 --> 00:15:57.770\nI'm not connected to a profile manager.\n\n316\n00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.842\nI'm not connected to an open directory.\n\n317\n00:15:59.842 --> 00:16:01.610\nI don't have a \"network\", per say.\n\n318\n00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.220\nAll of my machines are independent.\n\n319\n00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.520\nSo, I don't have that.\n\n320\n00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.210\nBut if I was doing centralized management,\n\n321\n00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.690\nthen I might have a slash network\nslash library, and those would\n\n322\n00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.940\nbe settings that the administrator's able\nto push out that apply to all of this.\n\n323\n00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.825\nIf you install the server app so, if I\nwere to go and install the OS 10 server\n\n324\n00:16:18.825 --> 00:16:22.955\napp from the app store, it puts all of its\nsettings inside of the network folder,\n\n325\n00:16:22.955 --> 00:16:24.868\nall of its little services that run.\n\n326\n00:16:24.868 --> 00:16:29.599\nCuz they're network services that would\naffect other people on the network,\n\n327\n00:16:29.599 --> 00:16:31.270\nnot just this machine.\n\n328\n00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.904\nAnd so that stuff makes in\ntheir /network/library.\n\n329\n00:16:33.904 --> 00:16:37.670\nAnd then the last one is\nthe super secret one.\n\n330\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:38.910\nIt's the one that's the system domain.\n\n331\n00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.860\nIt's the one that only Apple\nis supposed to mess with.\n\n332\n00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.720\nNow in the old days it\nwasn't like that and\n\n333\n00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.890\nthere were programs that\nwere allowed to write to it.\n\n334\n00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:47.832\nApple said that's a no-no now.\n\n335\n00:16:47.832 --> 00:16:50.740\nIf you read their developer specs you're\nnot supposed to write to this folder.\n\n336\n00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.200\nBut it's still there, you can see it.\n\n337\n00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.641\nThey have integrity protection.\n\n338\n00:16:54.641 --> 00:16:57.660\nI think we talked about system integrity\nin one of the earlier episodes.\n\n339\n00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.100\nAnd so if you start messing\nwith stuff in this folder\n\n340\n00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.500\nyour machine will actually put it back,\nit will undo your changes.\n\n341\n00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.370\nSo it's kinda protected.\n\n342\n00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:07.110\nLet me show you where it is anyway\njust if you're up for that stuff.\n\n343\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:10.453\nOn your hard drive you got\na folder called System.\n\n344\n00:17:10.453 --> 00:17:15.420\nAnd inside of System,\nyou'll find a folder called Library.\n\n345\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.510\nSo I'm in /System/ Library.\n\n346\n00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:23.020\nAnd if you poked around in there,\nyou'll see a lot of the same stuff right?\n\n347\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.345\nNow I don't have a preferences folder\nbecause the operating system uses\n\n348\n00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:29.945\nthe default preferences the operating\nsystem isn't going to impose separate\n\n349\n00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:31.930\npreferences like that so we don't see it.\n\n350\n00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.927\nAnd if I look under A for\napplications support I don't see that and\n\n351\n00:17:35.927 --> 00:17:40.726\nthe reason is the system only supports\nthe applications packaged from Apple,\n\n352\n00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:45.070\nnot the third party ones,\njust the ones that are baked into the OS.\n\n353\n00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.390\nSo, it doesn't have that, but it has got\nall the other stuff like keychains and\n\n354\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.700\nkeyboard layouts and\nall of the other things.\n\n355\n00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.201\nThis kind of serves as that template for\n\n356\n00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:54.437\nthe library folder that\ngets created in the next.\n\n357\n00:17:54.437 --> 00:17:58.020\nSo, this is the fourth one and it's\nthe one that we don't normally mess with.\n\n358\n00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.513\nFor the exam, what you really need to\nremember here is not so much of these\n\n359\n00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:05.130\nlibrary folders, who cares about that You\nneed to remember that the four domains.\n\n360\n00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:09.570\nUser settings, local settings,\nor machine, network settings or\n\n361\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:13.710\na joint network, and then system\nsettings just the one defined by Apple.\n\n362\n00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:14.790\nThose are our four domains.\n\n363\n00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.250\nAll right,\nother things that we need to think about.\n\n364\n00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:20.380\nFile extensions.\n\n365\n00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.990\nI know I've talked a little bit about file\nextensions in the last episode about how\n\n366\n00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:24.330\ndon't normally see them.\n\n367\n00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.020\nIf have an RTF file, I just see the file,\nand the extension is hidden.\n\n368\n00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.380\nWell the extensions do\nactually have a purpose.\n\n369\n00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.420\nThey kind of tell us what program should\nopen up this file, at least by default.\n\n370\n00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.620\nBut you don't even have to do that,\ncuz you can override the settings, right?\n\n371\n00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.850\nSo, for example, let's say that I,\nlet's say I have an RTF file.\n\n372\n00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.310\nDo I still have an RTF file laying around?\n\n373\n00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.130\nYeah.\n\n374\n00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.320\nSo, I've got this RTF file.\n\n375\n00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.400\nIt's a rich text file.\n\n376\n00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.860\nNow, if I look at the file\non the hard drive,\n\n377\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.440\nit's Document.rtf, but\nthat RTF extension is hidden here.\n\n378\n00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.365\nI don't see the extension by default,\nright.\n\n379\n00:18:55.365 --> 00:18:57.285\nBut the system knows that it's an RTF and\n\n380\n00:18:57.285 --> 00:19:01.595\nit knows that the text edit\nprogram can open RTFs, right?\n\n381\n00:19:01.595 --> 00:19:04.675\nSo, if I double click on this,\nit's gonna open up in text edit,\n\n382\n00:19:04.675 --> 00:19:06.185\nthere it is and I got my document.\n\n383\n00:19:07.725 --> 00:19:10.145\nBut I don't see that extension and\n\n384\n00:19:10.145 --> 00:19:12.715\nif the icon doesn't say it,\nhow do I know it's an RTF?\n\n385\n00:19:12.715 --> 00:19:17.010\nWell, if you switch to your list view,\nyou've got the kind column And\n\n386\n00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.640\nI can see over here that it is an RTF.\n\n387\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.510\nSo that's how I know.\n\n388\n00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.580\nThat's why I don't need to see it,\nbut the file system does have it.\n\n389\n00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.300\nYou can override that behavior.\n\n390\n00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.810\nYou can always Control click on it and go\nto Open With, and choose another program.\n\n391\n00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.740\nEither one that Mac OS already\nknows about, or one that you add.\n\n392\n00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.140\nNow when I say it knows about it,\nsee how it's got TextEdit,\n\n393\n00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.470\nand it doesn't know about any others?\n\n394\n00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.540\nHow does it know what\nprograms can open up RTFs?\n\n395\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:49.085\nWell, inside of your user settings,\nyou've got an extensions folder.\n\n396\n00:19:49.085 --> 00:19:51.904\nAnd the extensions folder is keeping\ntrack of other programs that\n\n397\n00:19:51.904 --> 00:19:54.500\nhave been installed to\nhandle things differently.\n\n398\n00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.070\nSo if you take, for\nexample, here my desktop.\n\n399\n00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.690\nCuz I got a ton of junk\ninstalled on my laptop.\n\n400\n00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.810\nSo here If I fire up Text Edit, and\n\n401\n00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.190\nI'm just gonna creat a new\nfile here on my desktop.\n\n402\n00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:08.580\nSo I'll do a new document.\n\n403\n00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.720\nThis is a document,\nvery exciting and I'm gonna save it.\n\n404\n00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.150\nI'll save it right on my desktop.\n\n405\n00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.870\nI'll just call it document, right.\n\n406\n00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.450\nSo it's saved.\n\n407\n00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.490\nAnd there it is.\n\n408\n00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.080\nOkay, so\nhere's this document that I just made,\n\n409\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.920\nit shows as an .rtf, and there it is.\n\n410\n00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.080\nNow if I right click on that and\n\n411\n00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.930\ngo to Open With, I get a lot more\nthan what we just saw, right?\n\n412\n00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.700\nBecause I have a lot\nmore programs installed.\n\n413\n00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.330\nI can open it up in Word, I could\nopen it up in TextEdit or FluidApp.\n\n414\n00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.660\nI could open it up in Marked 2.\n\n415\n00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.950\nI've got a few different programs\nthat are gonna open up .rtfs.\n\n416\n00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.530\nWhen I installed each of these programs,\nthey\n\n417\n00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:46.990\nregistered in the extensions of Mac OS\nto say, by the way, I can open that too.\n\n418\n00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.060\nThey don't always show up here.\n\n419\n00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:48.730\nSo for example,\n\n420\n00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.650\nif I go down a little bit, actually\nthis one is not gonna show it, is it?\n\n421\n00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.420\nSometimes you'll see a Services folder,\nor actually it's back over here.\n\n422\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.240\nI'm looking in the wrong spot.\n\n423\n00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.807\nWhen I'm zoomed in this far,\nI can't see everything.\n\n424\n00:20:57.807 --> 00:20:59.823\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you've got this Services, and\n\n425\n00:20:59.823 --> 00:21:01.963\nsometimes things register\nhere in Services.\n\n426\n00:21:01.963 --> 00:21:05.840\nSo for example, if I wanna encrypt that\nTXT file, I've got OpenPGP installed.\n\n427\n00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.630\nOr if I wanna archive it,\nI've got regular MacOS archiving and\n\n428\n00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.900\nI've got Entropy that I\ncan use to archive it.\n\n429\n00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.240\nSo I've got a few different programs.\n\n430\n00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.720\nSo you might see it down\nhere under services too.\n\n431\n00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.420\nBut those are extensions to the system,\nwe've extended the operability of the OS,\n\n432\n00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.770\nand those have registered with the system\nas an extension, that's why they show up.\n\n433\n00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:27.050\nIf they don't show up, well,\nyou can always choose Open With and\n\n434\n00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:30.490\nOther, and you can choose\nanother application that way.\n\n435\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.020\nOr, if you always want to\nopen with an alternate app,\n\n436\n00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.230\nif you do a Get Info,\nright here you've got that Open With, and\n\n437\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.520\nyou can choose what you're\ngoing to open it with.\n\n438\n00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.290\nAnd when you choose a new program,\nyou can choose Change All and\n\n439\n00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:44.420\nit'll tell the system from now on,\n\n440\n00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.710\nwhen you see that extension,\nopen it with this other program.\n\n441\n00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.490\nSo, I know this is an RTF.\n\n442\n00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.750\nI don't wanna open it with text edit,\nI wanna open it with Microsoft Word.\n\n443\n00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:57.160\nSo I can choose Microsoft Word, and now it\nknows for this file, to open it with Word.\n\n444\n00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:02.380\nBut if I want all RTFs to open with Word,\nI can choose change all, and\n\n445\n00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.230\nit's gonna prompt me.\n\n446\n00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.125\nYou have to be an administrator to make\nthat change since it's gonna change it\n\n447\n00:22:06.125 --> 00:22:06.667\nsystem wide.\n\n448\n00:22:06.667 --> 00:22:09.390\nActually, it didn't prompt me,\nso this must be a user setting.\n\n449\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:10.300\nThat's the easy way to tell.\n\n450\n00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.380\nIf it's system wide, you get prompted for\na password, if it's not,\n\n451\n00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.780\nyou don't get prompted,\nso I didn't get prompted.\n\n452\n00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:20.290\nSo I'll choose Microsoft Word, and so\nnow when I bump into these RTF files,\n\n453\n00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:23.490\nWell, they're RTFs, but when I open them,\n\n454\n00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.840\ninstead of opening in text edit,\nit's gonna fire up Microsoft Word.\n\n455\n00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.430\nAnd so I get to enjoy the slowness\nof Word launching, and\n\n456\n00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:30.730\nthere we go, this is a document.\n\n457\n00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.910\nNow I'm in it and\nit knows that other program.\n\n458\n00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.010\nSo those are extensions\nto the operating system.\n\n459\n00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.790\nI've extended the functionality of Mac OS\nby installing alternate programs and\n\n460\n00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.510\nthose get registered with the system.\n\n461\n00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.300\nAnd those get tucked away\nin your library folder.\n\n462\n00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:49.280\nSo inside of the library folder,\nthere's a folder called extensions and\n\n463\n00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.090\nso I'm just gonna go to my system\nlibrary folder and into extensions.\n\n464\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:58.900\nAnd when I look in here, these texts\nfiles, these kernelling extensions,\n\n465\n00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.870\nI just see a handful of things\ncuz this is a stock install.\n\n466\n00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.580\nBut if you take a desktop like mine.\n\n467\n00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.440\nSo, obviously,\nI've got a ton of junk installed on mine.\n\n468\n00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:13.590\nIf I browse into /Library/Extensions and I\ntake a look, I don't see a whole lot here.\n\n469\n00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.930\nThere are a few things like\nthe Blackmagic software I use for\n\n470\n00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:20.930\ncontrolling our little video converters\nwe have, DeckLink, a few other things.\n\n471\n00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.876\nBut if I go into my own library,\nthere's probably some more in there.\n\n472\n00:23:24.876 --> 00:23:26.700\nActually, I don't have any in there,\nall right.\n\n473\n00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.020\nSo I don't anything I saw in there.\n\n474\n00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.470\nBut you'll start to see\nadditional software, for example,\n\n475\n00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:31.130\nthis one right here.\n\n476\n00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:36.020\nI have a software program that lets me\nread NTFS-formatted drives in MAC OS.\n\n477\n00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.370\nAnd so it shows up right here that I've\ngot this special file system extension.\n\n478\n00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.170\nThat's changing the functionality\nat OS and extending it out.\n\n479\n00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.910\nThese are the types of things that\nare getting installed as part of your\n\n480\n00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:45.650\nlibrary folder.\n\n481\n00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:47.030\n>> Yeah Don, I'll tell you what.\n\n482\n00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.989\nI've actually had to work with this quite\nextensively working at Help Desks over\n\n483\n00:23:50.989 --> 00:23:51.988\nthe past few years.\n\n484\n00:23:51.988 --> 00:23:54.752\nPeople tend to we've seen how\nthis is supposed to work.\n\n485\n00:23:54.752 --> 00:23:56.840\nI've got a file and it's got an extension,\n\n486\n00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.995\nthat let's me know what\nprogram opens it up.\n\n487\n00:23:58.995 --> 00:24:00.514\nHere's where the problem happens.\n\n488\n00:24:00.514 --> 00:24:04.118\nIs that the users in their\ninfinite awesomeness they tend to,\n\n489\n00:24:04.118 --> 00:24:09.200\nI don't know how, but they'll change\nthe association to the wrong program.\n\n490\n00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.850\nAnd they'll tell me I'm trying to open\nup this file and it's not working,\n\n491\n00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:14.400\nit's giving me an error or\nsomething like that.\n\n492\n00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:19.870\nThis is the prime clue to lead you\nto believe that they've chosen,\n\n493\n00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:21.850\nthey've changed the extension.\n\n494\n00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.300\nNow you're saying I'm trying to open\nup this .PDF, your Adobe is giving you\n\n495\n00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.655\nproblems, and even if you do get it open,\nit shows up like gobbledygook.\n\n496\n00:24:29.655 --> 00:24:31.985\nNow, you probably need to\nchange that to a different,\n\n497\n00:24:31.985 --> 00:24:37.285\nthey've probably managed to derail it\nsomehow and change that default program.\n\n498\n00:24:37.285 --> 00:24:41.675\nTry things like Word, try things like\nText Edit to change different things, and\n\n499\n00:24:41.675 --> 00:24:45.025\nsee if that doesn't show up a little\nbit better if you do see that problem.\n\n500\n00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:46.585\nI don't know if you have, Don.\n\n501\n00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:48.025\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n502\n00:24:48.025 --> 00:24:50.880\nSo, where this gets confusing is there's\n\n503\n00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.930\nactually two different kinds of\nextensions that we're dealing with.\n\n504\n00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.560\nRight?\nSo there's the file extension\n\n505\n00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.780\nwhich changes what that file does and\n\n506\n00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.490\nthen there's kernel extensions which\nchange what your operation system does.\n\n507\n00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.790\nAnd so they're both extensions,\nthey're extending functionality,\n\n508\n00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.210\nbut they're working in a different way.\n\n509\n00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.730\nRight?\nA file extension anybody can change that,\n\n510\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.730\nmultiple programmers can do it, but\n\n511\n00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.720\na kernel extension we're adding that\noperating system functionality.\n\n512\n00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:14.450\nI'm adding the ability to\nread NTFS drives or whatever.\n\n513\n00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.350\nThat's a harder thing to do so\nfile extensions,\n\n514\n00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.380\nyou're end-users can mess with them,\nit's easy for them to overwrite it.\n\n515\n00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.840\nIt's something that\nyou'll have to put back.\n\n516\n00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.560\nKernel extensions, those are normally\ndone through installing software.\n\n517\n00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.030\nSo it's a little harder for an end-user\nto mess that one up, but I mean,\n\n518\n00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.230\ncertainly they can start installing\nall sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n519\n00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.160\nAnd there's certain types of Malware,\n\n520\n00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.430\nthey can get installed that way to\nyou got to be careful of those.\n\n521\n00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.260\nSo, two different kinds of extensions but\n\n522\n00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:38.150\nthey both extend that functionality\nwhat our core OS is doing.\n\n523\n00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.380\nAll right, few other folders\nthat I want to point out, again,\n\n524\n00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.360\njust trying think of a stuff that users\ndon't normally need to mess with.\n\n525\n00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.710\nLet me go back into that\nlibrary folder and so,\n\n526\n00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.900\nI'm gonna browse into my hard drive,\nand browse in to library.\n\n527\n00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.290\nI just wanna highlight a few\nothers that are important in here.\n\n528\n00:25:53.290 --> 00:26:00.400\nOne that is important is the frameworks\nfolder, which is this guy, frameworks.\n\n529\n00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.320\nWhen you write a program,\nif you're a developer, and\n\n530\n00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.030\nyou write a program, the odds are,\nwhatever it is you're trying to do,\n\n531\n00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.190\nyou're not the first person\nin the world that's done it.\n\n532\n00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.530\nSo, if you wanna make a button\nappear on the screen,\n\n533\n00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.350\nyou're not the first person to\nhave a button, or a check box.\n\n534\n00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:16.610\nYou might be the first person to create\na program that does whatever yours\n\n535\n00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:20.470\nis designed for, so that may be unique,\nbut the on screen elements, and\n\n536\n00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:21.510\nstuff like that, are the same.\n\n537\n00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:25.540\nAnd so there's frameworks that you can get\nthat already have the simple stuff done,\n\n538\n00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.120\nso you can focus on the hard stuff.\n\n539\n00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.770\nThings like the Java runtime environment,\n\n540\n00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:31.160\nwhere it's got a bunch of that\nframework already in place.\n\n541\n00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.380\nAnd those get installed right\nhere in the Frameworks folder.\n\n542\n00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.180\nAnd so\nyour Frameworks folder could be empty,\n\n543\n00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.660\nit could have a bunch of other stuff.\n\n544\n00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.710\nNotice I've got the iTunes library and\nAudio Mix Engine.\n\n545\n00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:44.670\nSo if I wanna play an mp3 file,\nmy player might have the most\n\n546\n00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:49.360\nrevolutionary user interface in the world,\nbut when it goes to play that music file,\n\n547\n00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.380\nit's going to play it just like\nevery other program out there.\n\n548\n00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.820\nSo we can call these libraries\nthat are already registered,\n\n549\n00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.840\nalready frameworks that are on the system,\nand off they go.\n\n550\n00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.490\nAnd as you start installing third\nparty software you may see more and\n\n551\n00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:01.390\nmore stuff appear.\n\n552\n00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:05.920\nSo for example going back to my\ndesktop which granted is a little\n\n553\n00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.010\noverwhelmed with junk.\n\n554\n00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:13.630\nBut if I browse into Library/Frameworks\nlet's see if I have anything different.\n\n555\n00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:16.580\nNo, actually I've kept mine pretty clean,\nhaven't I?\n\n556\n00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:22.420\nSo yeah, just some audio codex, DeckLink\nagain, iTunes, yeah, nothing too crazy.\n\n557\n00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.270\nWell, I mean you see my gpg, right,\n\n558\n00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.520\nthere's that file encryption\nframework that's been added.\n\n559\n00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.880\nSo that any of my other programs can start\nto encrypt and reference this framework.\n\n560\n00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.970\nSo, as you add those frameworks,\nthey'll start to appear there.\n\n561\n00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:38.090\nOther things in the library folder,\nyou might have a log folder.\n\n562\n00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.870\nAnd the log folder is where, if something\ngoes wrong, it'll log to the log folder.\n\n563\n00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.220\nSo if I browse into logs.\n\n564\n00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.200\nThere we go.\n\n565\n00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.460\nThen you can find system logs and other\ndata, like diagnostic reports and so on.\n\n566\n00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.470\nThose are stored in there.\n\n567\n00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.030\nThe preferences folder I've already talked\nabout, all the different setting and\n\n568\n00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.550\ncustomization settings that we make.\n\n569\n00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.860\nIf I change my wallpaper,\nI want that to pertain to me,\n\n570\n00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.360\nnot to all the other users on the system.\n\n571\n00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.260\nSo that will go into the preferences\nfolder in my own library,\n\n572\n00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.930\nnot in the system library.\n\n573\n00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.900\nAnd then lastly start up items.\n\n574\n00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.450\nStart up items is actually deprecating.\n\n575\n00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.110\nYou shouldn't use that one anymore.\n\n576\n00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.810\nThere's a whole launcher system,\n\n577\n00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.000\nthe Launcher D that's a part of\nthe newer versions of MacOS.\n\n578\n00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.340\nBut if you've upgraded several times\nyou might see a start up items folder.\n\n579\n00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.350\nAnd in fact, I think you\nactually have it on a new system.\n\n580\n00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.190\nYeah it's there, but it should be empty.\n\n581\n00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.380\nYou see this one's empty, there's nothing\nin it cuz everybody should've moved over\n\n582\n00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.100\nto the launcher D system now.\n\n583\n00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.500\nBut you may have start up items and\n\n584\n00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.870\nthese are things that'll run\nwhen your system starts.\n\n585\n00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:36.630\nNow if you have those, you can also\nsee in view of the user account.\n\n586\n00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.730\nSo if I got into system preferences,\nhere let me pick one that's not empty.\n\n587\n00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:40.950\nI'll take my own account.\n\n588\n00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.470\nSo on my own laptop, I've got a number\nof programs that start when I start up.\n\n589\n00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.430\nNow when I go into users and\ngroups, and I pick my user and\n\n590\n00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:51.550\nI go to login items, these are all\nthings that start up when I login.\n\n591\n00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:55.090\nSome of these might be in\nthe start up items in my library.\n\n592\n00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:57.010\nSome of these might be\nlaunched by launcher D.\n\n593\n00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:58.430\nI hope they're all launched by launcher D,\n\n594\n00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.660\ncuz that's how they're\nsupposed to be done.\n\n595\n00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.470\nBut if not, then you might have these\nlaunching from your start up items folder.\n\n596\n00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.960\nSo that's another one that\ncan be kind of important.\n\n597\n00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.360\nAll right, the last one that I really\nwant to spend some time on, and\n\n598\n00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.700\nDaniel made fun of me for this before\nthe show, is the fonts folder, right.\n\n599\n00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.920\nNow I know what your thinking, why do\nwe need to learn about fonts, right.\n\n600\n00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.840\nIf you're not familiar with fonts when you\ntype a letter on the screen it appears\n\n601\n00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.550\na certain way, right.\n\n602\n00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:24.350\nThat's a font, and\nevery system has some fonts by default.\n\n603\n00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:27.000\nSo if I fire up TextEdit.\n\n604\n00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.060\nAnd let me pick something really big so\nI can read it.\n\n605\n00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.250\nAll right.\nThis is a document.\n\n606\n00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.400\nRight?\nVery wonderful.\n\n607\n00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.690\nWhen I type that document,\nit appears as a certain font and\n\n608\n00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:40.030\nup here I've got this list of\nsystem fonts that came with Mac OS.\n\n609\n00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:43.430\nI can come in here and I can pick\nCourier or however I want it to look and\n\n610\n00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:45.320\nit changes the way that text looks.\n\n611\n00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:51.700\nNow, the trick here is Apple includes a\nlist of fonts with their operating system.\n\n612\n00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.400\nAnd so when you buy a Mac, you're buying a\nlicense for OS 10 and that license for OS\n\n613\n00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.530\n10 includes licenses to use these fonts,\nso you have permission to use the fonts.\n\n614\n00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:04.090\nBut if you're a commercial entity and\nyou're creating, or\n\n615\n00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:06.590\nmaybe you're writing the next\ngreat American novel and\n\n616\n00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:10.240\nyou wanna use a certain font in that\nnovel, the license that you've got\n\n617\n00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.630\ndoesn't normally extend to cover you\nturning around and selling a novel.\n\n618\n00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.390\nThe license that you have is typically for\nyour personal use and\n\n619\n00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:20.840\nwhen you become a commercial entity and\nstart selling that, now the fonts\n\n620\n00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.460\nare covered under trade marks and\ncopyrights and all that other good stuff.\n\n621\n00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.900\nIt's intellectual property.\n\n622\n00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:30.040\nSo you might need to have specific fonts\nthat you are licensed and allowed to use.\n\n623\n00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.680\nWell, that means you're\ngonna need to install fonts.\n\n624\n00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.590\nAnd so if you're a home user,\nyou don't care about this.\n\n625\n00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:38.370\nEven if you're a small business,\nyou probably don't care about this.\n\n626\n00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.772\nBut in a large organization, you will\nlikely have dedicated fonts that you\n\n627\n00:30:41.772 --> 00:30:45.290\nare specifically approved to use in\nall of your commercial communications.\n\n628\n00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:49.190\nAnd so, as part of our support role,\nwe may need to install those fonts.\n\n629\n00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.860\nAnd it's not as easy as you'd think.\n\n630\n00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.200\nWhen you go into the Library folder.\n\n631\n00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.600\nSo if I browse into my personal library.\n\n632\n00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.420\nI'll just go up here into Go, and Library.\n\n633\n00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.450\nInside of the Library folder,\nyou will have a Fonts folder, okay?\n\n634\n00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:06.080\nAnd when I look inside of my Fonts folder,\nit's empty.\n\n635\n00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.600\nIt's empty cuz there's no fonts\nthat I've specifically installed.\n\n636\n00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.340\nBut if I browse to my hard drive,\nand I go into Library,\n\n637\n00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.340\nthere'll be a Fonts folder there too.\n\n638\n00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:15.920\nAnd, it may also be empty.\n\n639\n00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.520\nLet's see if it is.\n\n640\n00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.090\nNope, this one's got some stuff.\n\n641\n00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:23.450\nSometimes, the fonts are stored in\nthe system library instead of in this one.\n\n642\n00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:26.280\nIn this case, it looks like\nwe've got them all right here.\n\n643\n00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.090\nSo, when I go into /library/fonts,\n\n644\n00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.350\nhere's all those fonts that I\nwas picking from a minute ago.\n\n645\n00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.830\nSo I chose Courier.\n\n646\n00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.940\nSo if I look in here,\nI'll find here's Courier.\n\n647\n00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.970\nCourier New, Courier New Italic,\nBold, Bold and Italic.\n\n648\n00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.450\nFour different variations\nof that same font.\n\n649\n00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:47.280\nBut when I was in text edit, when I\npicked that font, I just saw Courier.\n\n650\n00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.870\nI didn't see the four\nvariations of Courier.\n\n651\n00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:50.842\nAll right?\n\n652\n00:31:50.842 --> 00:31:52.503\nThis is why fonts are a little\ntricky to install.\n\n653\n00:31:52.503 --> 00:31:56.335\nWhen you install a font,\nit has to understand not just a font, but\n\n654\n00:31:56.335 --> 00:31:57.252\na font family.\n\n655\n00:31:57.252 --> 00:32:01.073\nCourier New is a family of fonts and\nit's got four variations.\n\n656\n00:32:01.073 --> 00:32:05.524\nThere's Regular, and then there's Bold,\nand then there's Italics,\n\n657\n00:32:05.524 --> 00:32:08.000\nand then there's Bold and Italics.\n\n658\n00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.210\nThat's four variations of the same font.\n\n659\n00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:13.190\nSo when I install a font, I need to do\na little more than just drag it and\n\n660\n00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:15.060\ndrop it right into that Fonts folder.\n\n661\n00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.980\nI need to use the Font Book application.\n\n662\n00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.630\nAnd if you think this is silly,\nI kind of agree.\n\n663\n00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.990\nIt all comes down to licensing and\nthe registrations of these fonts.\n\n664\n00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:25.450\nBut it's also on the exam, so\n\n665\n00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:27.940\nit's really important that you know\nit if you wanna pass the exam.\n\n666\n00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.490\nBut on your Mac,\nyou have a program called Font Book.\n\n667\n00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.120\nIt's kinda like Facebook.\n\n668\n00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:37.130\nAnd so, if you run the Font Book, and what\nit does is it shows you all the fonts.\n\n669\n00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:42.090\nBut it's showing, let me just leave that\nbe, there, it's showing you all the fonts,\n\n670\n00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:46.460\nbut it's showing them to you\norganized by their font family.\n\n671\n00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.480\nAnd so when I come in here and\n\n672\n00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.360\nI find Courier,\nthere's the four fonts grouped together.\n\n673\n00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.960\nAnd instead of Italic, they call it\nOblique, right, so slightly tilted.\n\n674\n00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.230\nSo we've got Regular, Oblique,\nBold, and Bold Oblique all here,\n\n675\n00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:00.570\ngrouped together, in the same font family.\n\n676\n00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.106\nAnd so from the Font Book,\nI can install fonts.\n\n677\n00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:06.730\nAnd I can organize them into\na family if I want, right?\n\n678\n00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:11.840\nSo, before the show, I went and\nI downloaded a font.\n\n679\n00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.903\nAnd, it's a, what do you call it,\na public domain font, one that,\n\n680\n00:33:15.903 --> 00:33:21.130\nit's available for anybody to use,\ncalled Tuffy, so I've got the Tuffy font.\n\n681\n00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.330\nAnd when I downloaded it,\nsee how it came with a license?\n\n682\n00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:26.310\nI mean, these font people, they\nare really strict about their licensing.\n\n683\n00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:28.000\nIt's really serious business.\n\n684\n00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.185\nAnd so when I look,\nI've got Tuffy Bold Italic.\n\n685\n00:33:30.185 --> 00:33:36.210\nAnd I've got Tuffy Bold,\nI've got Tuffy Regular, right?\n\n686\n00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.400\nAnd Regular Tuffy Italic,\nI've got a few different ones.\n\n687\n00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.200\nAnd there's several\ndifferent font formats.\n\n688\n00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.780\nThere's otf, there's ttf, right?\n\n689\n00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.010\nEach of these are just\ndifferent formats for the font.\n\n690\n00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:49.860\nAnd so, the one that you need\nis usually going to be the ttf.\n\n691\n00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.970\nBut the otf's are supported by Apple also,\nso you can kinda do either one.\n\n692\n00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.880\nAnd if I wanna import these in, instead of\njust throwing them into that Font folder,\n\n693\n00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.780\nI should bring them in\nthrough the Font Book.\n\n694\n00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.670\nThat's gonna make sure that they're\nregistered with the system,\n\n695\n00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:02.750\nthat they're registered as a family, and\n\n696\n00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:06.100\nthat they're visible to my\napplications and ready to rock.\n\n697\n00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:10.270\nSo we can bring them right\nin through the Font Book.\n\n698\n00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:13.590\nNow, honestly, if I just browse to it and\ndouble-click on one of these things,\n\n699\n00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.750\nit's gonna open it, and\nit's opening it in the Font Book.\n\n700\n00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:19.890\nAnd so I see it, here's the Bold,\nItalic version of Tuffy.\n\n701\n00:34:19.890 --> 00:34:22.790\nAnd if I drop that down,\nI only see Bold-Italic.\n\n702\n00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.695\nAnd I can choose to install the font.\n\n703\n00:34:24.695 --> 00:34:28.300\nAnd so the Font Book is installing\nthat font for me, okay?\n\n704\n00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.900\nAnd see how it shows up under User?\n\n705\n00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.400\nIt's now a user font.\n\n706\n00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.150\nIt's not a system font because I\ninstalled it for me personally.\n\n707\n00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:38.939\nAn administrator could go in and\ninstall it for the system as a whole.\n\n708\n00:34:38.939 --> 00:34:40.286\nSo that was Tuffy Bold.\n\n709\n00:34:40.286 --> 00:34:41.788\nLet's get some of these other ots'.\n\n710\n00:34:41.788 --> 00:34:45.550\nI'll do, wait,\nthat was Bold Italic, I guess.\n\n711\n00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:48.400\nSo let me just do each one of these,\nit's hard to keep track of these things.\n\n712\n00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.430\nSo we'll get Regular Italic and\nwe'll install that one too.\n\n713\n00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:53.310\nAnd then lastly,\nI'm gonna install just the regular,\n\n714\n00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.090\nold Tuffy, and we'll get that.\n\n715\n00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:59.570\nSo when it's done,\nsee how I still have one entry for Tuffy?\n\n716\n00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.510\nWell when I expanded it, it recognized\nthat family, and it's got them all\n\n717\n00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:06.740\ntied together, and it put them in\nthe right spot, or at least I hope it did.\n\n718\n00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.380\nLet's go and make sure that it did.\n\n719\n00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.870\nIf I browse into my library, and\n\n720\n00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:16.680\nI browse into my fonts folder, there\nthey are, all four of them right there.\n\n721\n00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.050\nNot only are they copied\nto the right place but\n\n722\n00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.260\nthey're registered with the Font Book.\n\n723\n00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.920\nAnd that's what's gonna make it\nwhere programs are able to see it.\n\n724\n00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.685\nSo when I go back to my\ntext edit program here, and\n\n725\n00:35:26.685 --> 00:35:31.360\nI drop-down that font, what we should\nsee is the Tuffy font appears.\n\n726\n00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.610\nWe might have to close the app and\nrelaunch it.\n\n727\n00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:35.520\nNope, it's already there.\n\n728\n00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.040\nI can choose Tuffy.\n\n729\n00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.230\nAnd now I can do Tuffy Regular, or\n\n730\n00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:46.100\nBold, or Italics, or Bold and Italics.\n\n731\n00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.400\nIf I hadn't installed those\nother forms of the font,\n\n732\n00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.060\nI wouldn't of been able to do these.\n\n733\n00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:50.790\nI had to have all four.\n\n734\n00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:52.300\nThey have to be registered\nwith the system.\n\n735\n00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.780\nSo, fonts are a little special.\n\n736\n00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.900\nWhen you see that fonts folder,\ndon't just assume you can drag and\n\n737\n00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:56.870\ndrop the stuff there.\n\n738\n00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:58.630\nYou need to make sure you install\nit through the Font Book.\n\n739\n00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.865\nIt's an important thing and it's likely\nthe answer to a question on the exam.\n\n740\n00:36:01.865 --> 00:36:04.677\n>> Well, Don, I think the most important\nthing we learned today is how to keep\n\n741\n00:36:04.677 --> 00:36:06.207\nthe font mafia from off of our doorstep.\n\n742\n00:36:06.207 --> 00:36:07.949\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wanting to break our legs for\n\n743\n00:36:07.949 --> 00:36:09.620\n[LAUGH] using unauthorized fonts.\n\n744\n00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.860\n>> Yeah, yeah, it's a big deal.\n\n745\n00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:15.750\nAnd they do sue, and so\nif you use this in a commercial sense,\n\n746\n00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:19.190\nthey expect you to have those licenses,\nthat's why I like Adobe Typekit.\n\n747\n00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.010\nIt is so useful.\n\n748\n00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.640\nYou can get an Adobe Typekit license and\nthat gives you a commercial license for\n\n749\n00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.560\nall those fonts.\n\n750\n00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.670\nThere's plenty of systems\nout there that do that.\n\n751\n00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:27.720\nDon't just go downloading random\nfonts on the Internet without\n\n752\n00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.900\nchecking their license first.\n\n753\n00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.850\n>> Wise words.\n\n754\n00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.730\nWords of safety and precaution.\n\n755\n00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:34.895\nDon, that being said, we've gone through\na lot of great information today.\n\n756\n00:36:34.895 --> 00:36:38.634\nWe've looked at hidden files, we've looked\nat folders, all the hidden folders,\n\n757\n00:36:38.634 --> 00:36:42.267\nshould I say, that are on our system, and\nfor good reason, and how we can work with\n\n758\n00:36:42.267 --> 00:36:45.830\napplications and their extensions,\nwe learned a lot about extensions today.\n\n759\n00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.128\nIs there anything else we need to\ncover before we wrap up the show?\n\n760\n00:36:48.128 --> 00:36:50.205\n>> The only thing I didn't get\nto were file archives, and\n\n761\n00:36:50.205 --> 00:36:51.975\nwe're gonna do a different\nepisode on those.\n\n762\n00:36:51.975 --> 00:36:53.685\nSo stay tuned,\nthat one will come up a little bit later.\n\n763\n00:36:53.685 --> 00:36:56.115\nI just wanna talk about disk images and\nfile archives, kind of a useful thing.\n\n764\n00:36:56.115 --> 00:37:00.335\nBut, as far as the built-in system files,\nthe various folders we expect to see,\n\n765\n00:37:00.335 --> 00:37:02.482\nhow to hide things,\nit's all pretty important,\n\n766\n00:37:02.482 --> 00:37:06.067\nyour average end user doesn't see it,\nyou as the support professional.\n\n767\n00:37:06.067 --> 00:37:07.097\nYou're expected to know it.\n\n768\n00:37:07.097 --> 00:37:10.337\n>> All right, well thank you so much for\ndropping by and showing us how to work\n\n769\n00:37:10.337 --> 00:37:13.557\nwith these extensions, these file types,\nand the folders, as well.\n\n770\n00:37:13.557 --> 00:37:15.992\nThat being said, looks like we're\nwrapping up yet another great episode.\n\n771\n00:37:15.992 --> 00:37:18.607\nHopefully you guys enjoyed it,\nand maybe even learned something.\n\n772\n00:37:18.607 --> 00:37:21.537\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n773\n00:37:21.537 --> 00:37:22.337\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n774\n00:37:22.337 --> 00:37:23.382\n>> And we'll see you

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:18.070\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.660\nAnd in today's episode we're\nmoving forward with our Appril,\n\n5\n00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.780\nour Appril,\nI cannot get that word out of my mouth.\n\n6\n00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.860\nApple Certified Support Professional\nseries.\n\n7\n00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.020\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto give us a little more help with that\n\n8\n00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.760\nis none other than our good friend Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.070\nDon, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n10\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.390\n>> Thanks for having me back Daniel and\n\n11\n00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.529\nit is almost April so I'm ready to start\nour April Certified Support Professional.\n\n12\n00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:37.318\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:40.778\n>> And so we're gonna be diving\nback into the world of Mac OS.\n\n14\n00:00:40.778 --> 00:00:44.540\nAnd we spent the last few episodes talking\nabout file systems and folders and so on.\n\n15\n00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.210\nSo we're just gonna keep\ngoing with that theme.\n\n16\n00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.460\nAnd this time we're gonna talk\nabout archives and images.\n\n17\n00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.120\nSo most of the time when\nwe deal with files and\n\n18\n00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.980\nfolders is really right\nhere on our own system.\n\n19\n00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.470\nBut occasionally we want to take a folder\nor folder and send it to somebody else.\n\n20\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.460\nWell, if it's just a file,\nmaybe that's not a big deal.\n\n21\n00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.530\nMaybe it's a small file,\nyou make an email attachment,\n\n22\n00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.090\nyou send it to somebody and you're done.\n\n23\n00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.000\nBut if it's a collection of files,\n\n24\n00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.700\nlike an entire folder, well now we\nneed a way to group them together.\n\n25\n00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.250\nAnd there's two main ways that\nwe can do that in Mac OS.\n\n26\n00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.590\nThe first way is to create an archive,\n\n27\n00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.700\nwhich is a single file that basically\ncompresses and stores other files.\n\n28\n00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.960\nAnd the other way is with a disk image.\n\n29\n00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.690\nNow a disk image technically takes\nan entire disk and creates a copy of it.\n\n30\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.480\nBut many vendors use this as\na way to distribute files, so\n\n31\n00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.880\nthey use it like an archive.\n\n32\n00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.290\nSo disk images and archives actually\nkind of perform the same behavior.\n\n33\n00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.400\nThe big difference between the two is that\na disk image doesn't normally compress\n\n34\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.495\ncontents cuz the contents\nare typically already compressed.\n\n35\n00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:43.472\nVersus an archive that really is\ndesigned to compress those contents and\n\n36\n00:01:43.472 --> 00:01:45.243\nmake them as small as possible.\n\n37\n00:01:45.243 --> 00:01:48.130\nSo that we can send them over the network\nit doesn't take a lot of bandwidth.\n\n38\n00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.260\nSo I'm gonna show you examples of both\ntoday and kinda how they get used.\n\n39\n00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.744\nNow the compression side, Apple has\nbuilt in compression support right into\n\n40\n00:01:55.744 --> 00:01:59.100\nthe operating system,\nas most modern operating systems have.\n\n41\n00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.450\nAnd the main default compression\nalgorithm you see out there is the zip\n\n42\n00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.160\nalgorithm, right?\n\n43\n00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.978\nSo zip is an archive format\nthat's been around since,\n\n44\n00:02:06.978 --> 00:02:10.425\nI don't even know, the 1980s,\nI've used it for a long time.\n\n45\n00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:13.895\nAnd you can take any file,\ngroup of files, or folder,\n\n46\n00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:18.810\nput them together into a single archive\nfile, and compress them if you want.\n\n47\n00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.870\nYou don't have to compress, but\nthe default is to compress, right?\n\n48\n00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.960\nSo for example, here on my desktop\nI've got a little text file, right?\n\n49\n00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.890\nIt's just full of junk text,\nis not anything too spectacular, but\n\n50\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.300\nthe point is I've got it.\n\n51\n00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.013\nAnd that text file, even though it's\nfull of junk text, is 61 KB in size.\n\n52\n00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:39.539\nRight, so that's its size and\nif I look down here it's actually\n\n53\n00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:43.545\n60,625 bytes which rounds up to\nabout 61 KB on the disk, right.\n\n54\n00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:45.228\nSo that's the size of that file.\n\n55\n00:02:45.228 --> 00:02:47.520\nNow that's a pretty small file.\n\n56\n00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.470\nIf I needed to send this to Daniel,\nI probably wouldn't compress it,\n\n57\n00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.360\nI'd just attach it to the email and\noff you go.\n\n58\n00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.270\nFiles under about 10 MB in size can\ngo as email attachments pretty easy.\n\n59\n00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.430\nOnce you get over 10 MB,\na lot of mail servers will drop those.\n\n60\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.340\nSo I might need to make a file\nsmaller to fit that limit.\n\n61\n00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.210\nAnd if I want that, all I've gotta\ndo is Ctrl+Click on my file.\n\n62\n00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.270\nAnd when you Ctrl+Click on\nthe file you get a lot of options.\n\n63\n00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.560\nBut the one I'm looking for is this\nguy right here, Compress \"file.txt\".\n\n64\n00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.830\nIt's just the name of the file.\n\n65\n00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.720\nIf I had picked a folder it would say\nCompress and the name of the folder.\n\n66\n00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.770\nAnd if we choose that, what's gonna happen\nis it's gonna archive that file and\n\n67\n00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.640\nyou'll see a new file up here.\n\n68\n00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.004\nRight, and so I see that file.txt\nappear and it's file.txt.zip.\n\n69\n00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:37.915\nLet me open this is the finder cuz it's\na little bit easier to see in here.\n\n70\n00:03:37.915 --> 00:03:42.350\nSo now I have file.txt and\nI've got file.txt.zip.\n\n71\n00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.920\nAll the zip did was compress it together,\nokay?\n\n72\n00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.140\nIf I had chosen more than one file,\nlike this, when I go to compress it,\n\n73\n00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.800\nsee how it says Compress 2 Items?\n\n74\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.630\nSo I can compress two things,\nnot just one.\n\n75\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.180\nI can compress 100 or\n1,000 things, it doesn't matter.\n\n76\n00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.060\nAnd when you compress those,\nnow it's gonna create a zip.\n\n77\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.877\nAnd see how it called it Archive.zip?\n\n78\n00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:05.360\nCuz it's got more than one file in there,\nright?\n\n79\n00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.026\nSo more than one file is stored inside\nof it and they're compressed together.\n\n80\n00:04:08.026 --> 00:04:11.220\nSo now I can send them all as one file\ninstead of a bunch of separate ones.\n\n81\n00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.500\n>> Now Don,\nthat Archive is a little nondescript.\n\n82\n00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.000\nAre we able to change that,\nand it doesn't break anything?\n\n83\n00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.040\n>> Yeah, yeah, the name doesn't really\nmatter, you can come in here and\n\n84\n00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.140\nrename that thing.\n\n85\n00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.340\nAnd so I might want to call it Files for\nDaniel.zip, and there we go.\n\n86\n00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.520\nAnd so now I can send it to you and\n\n87\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.590\nwhen you receive it all you have to do\nis double-click on the thing, right.\n\n88\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.461\nSo if you just double-click\nit will extract the files.\n\n89\n00:04:34.461 --> 00:04:36.741\nAnd so it makes a folder called Files for\nDaniel,\n\n90\n00:04:36.741 --> 00:04:39.923\nand inside of it are those files\nthat are uncompressed, all right.\n\n91\n00:04:39.923 --> 00:04:42.100\nNow let's take a look\nat the archives itself.\n\n92\n00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.250\nSo I had file.txt, and we saw when I\npulled it up that it was 61 KB in size.\n\n93\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.497\nI've file.text.zip where it's archived,\nand if I pull that one up,\n\n94\n00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:59.096\nnow when I look at it, as opposed to\n61 KB that it was before, 389 bytes.\n\n95\n00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:03.350\nI mean that file got really small,\nwe had huge compression on this.\n\n96\n00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.040\nIt's definitely gonna be easier\nto send over the network,\n\n97\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.060\nshould take far less bandwidth,\nis a fraction of the size.\n\n98\n00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.000\nIt's over 60 times smaller,\nit's actually more like 120 times smaller.\n\n99\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.455\nIt is a tiny, tiny file, right?\n\n100\n00:05:14.455 --> 00:05:16.450\nThat's what compression does for us.\n\n101\n00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.810\nBut be careful,\ncuz it doesn't always work out.\n\n102\n00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.820\nA lot of files are already compressed.\n\n103\n00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.028\nSo for example, if you have images, right,\nlike JPEGs, JPEGs are already compressed.\n\n104\n00:05:26.028 --> 00:05:29.100\nPNGs are already compressed.\n\n105\n00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.530\nDisk images a lot of times\nare already compressed, right.\n\n106\n00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.118\nSo if I go back here to my desktop, I've\ngot that googlechrome.dmg file, right.\n\n107\n00:05:37.118 --> 00:05:40.100\nThat's a disk image that Google is\nattributing with Google Chrome in it.\n\n108\n00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.625\nWell, if I look at it, it's 67.6 MB.\n\n109\n00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:45.960\nAll right, well I'm gonna compress it.\n\n110\n00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.710\nSo let me take that,\nI will compress googlechrome.dmg.\n\n111\n00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.140\nIt's gonna zip it up, there it goes.\n\n112\n00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:59.145\nNow it's compressed and when I pull it up,\nit was 67.6 MB, now it's 67.5 MB.\n\n113\n00:05:59.145 --> 00:06:00.510\nWhoo, big savings!\n\n114\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.435\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Not really, right?\n\n115\n00:06:02.435 --> 00:06:07.790\nIf I look at the raw data down here,\nit saved me 70 KB?\n\n116\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.400\nIt really didn't save me much at all.\n\n117\n00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.070\nIt's not even worth\ncompressing at this point.\n\n118\n00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.360\nAnd the reason is the file\nis already compressed.\n\n119\n00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.980\nGoogle already compressed it for me.\n\n120\n00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.760\nWhen you compress something that's already\ncompressed, you don't get a savings.\n\n121\n00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.920\nAll right, it's already as\nsmall as it's gonna get, and\n\n122\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.820\nsometimes it can even get bigger.\n\n123\n00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.071\nIf you compress a JPEG, it's very common\nfor the file to get bigger once it's\n\n124\n00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:30.187\ncompressed than it was\nwhen it was uncompressed.\n\n125\n00:06:30.187 --> 00:06:33.260\nCuz it was never actually uncompressed,\nit was already done.\n\n126\n00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.140\nSo be careful of that,\n\n127\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.780\ndon't expect to get huge gains all\nthe time when you compress something.\n\n128\n00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.430\nA lot of times when we do an archive\nlike this, it's not to compress it.\n\n129\n00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.810\nIt's simply to gather multiple files\ntogether into a single file and\n\n130\n00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.570\nthat's why they call it an archive, right?\n\n131\n00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.320\nIt's a collection of data that can\nthen be distributed as a single piece.\n\n132\n00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.590\nSo those are the way that we\ncan do those compressions.\n\n133\n00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.470\nNow when Google sent me\nGoogle Chrome though,\n\n134\n00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.360\nthey didn't send it to me as a zip.\n\n135\n00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.790\nThey sent it to me as a DMG.\n\n136\n00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.340\nI downloaded that, got it as a DMG,\nthat's a disk image.\n\n137\n00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.670\nWhat's a disk image?\n\n138\n00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.480\nWell originally,\n\n139\n00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.940\nback in the day, a disk image was\ndesigned to make a copy of a hard drive.\n\n140\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.720\nAnd that way if you ever had a failure,\nyou could restore from that copy and\n\n141\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.440\nyou were back in business, right.\n\n142\n00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.510\nOr if I had 100 machines to sep up,\n\n143\n00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.290\nI could create one image, and\nthen deploy that on all 100 machines.\n\n144\n00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.450\nNow they're all set up identically.\n\n145\n00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.450\nThat's what disk images were\noriginally designed for.\n\n146\n00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.845\nBut today we use them\nto distribute software.\n\n147\n00:07:28.845 --> 00:07:30.540\nThen we can take a collection of files and\n\n148\n00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.900\nput it inside of a DMG and\ndistribute it that way, right.\n\n149\n00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.280\nSo remember an application,\n\n150\n00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.760\nlike Google Chrome,\nan application is actually a .app file.\n\n151\n00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.470\nSo if I mount this Google Chrome installer\nand we get inside of it, that I see this\n\n152\n00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.620\nGoogle Chrome app and it wants me to drag\nand drop it into the applications folder.\n\n153\n00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.059\nBut if I right-click on it and choose Show\nPackage Contents, I can browse inside.\n\n154\n00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:56.852\nAnd I see it's actually a collection\nof folders and files, right.\n\n155\n00:07:56.852 --> 00:08:00.638\nSo they're distributing more than\njust one file here, it's a folder.\n\n156\n00:08:00.638 --> 00:08:04.008\nSo they can't just send me a folder over\nthe internet, that's not gonna work.\n\n157\n00:08:04.008 --> 00:08:09.730\nSo instead, they wrap it up in a DMG so\nthey can send it all at once, right?\n\n158\n00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.670\nNot so much worried about compression,\n\n159\n00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.050\nas they are worried about just\nkeeping the folders together.\n\n160\n00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.130\nWell, as people started using those\nDMGs more and more, and more for\n\n161\n00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.870\nthat purpose, Apple and\n\n162\n00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.958\nthe Unix organizations decided to roll\nout the ability to do compression too.\n\n163\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:28.560\nAnd so, DMGs can now compress\nas well as store data, but\n\n164\n00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.060\nthat's not their default function.\n\n165\n00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:30.650\nLet me show you.\n\n166\n00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.410\nIf you ever want to make\none of these DMGs, right.\n\n167\n00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.980\nSo, maybe I, let me clean up my mess here.\n\n168\n00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.250\nSo I've got my file.txt.\n\n169\n00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:43.600\nAnd we've already talked about\nfile.txt and how it was 61 KB in size.\n\n170\n00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.680\nSo it's 61K and I want to\ndistribute it out to some people.\n\n171\n00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.657\nSo I know the size of it is 61K and\nthat's great, right.\n\n172\n00:08:50.657 --> 00:08:53.280\nSo let me just get this where\nyou can see it all, right here.\n\n173\n00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.835\nOkay, so its 61K in size.\n\n174\n00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:59.968\nI want to send it out to people, and so\nI want to create a DMG for it, all right.\n\n175\n00:08:59.968 --> 00:09:02.220\nWhen you create a DMG, it's a disc image.\n\n176\n00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.540\nAnd the disc images have\na fixed size by default.\n\n177\n00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.141\nSo I have to tell it what\nsize I want that drive to be.\n\n178\n00:09:08.141 --> 00:09:09.883\nYou're basically creating\na fake hard drive.\n\n179\n00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.832\nAnd you give it a certain size, and\nyou put your files in it, right.\n\n180\n00:09:12.832 --> 00:09:16.338\nSo, I'm gonna make a fake hard drive for\nfile.txt.\n\n181\n00:09:16.338 --> 00:09:19.403\nI'm going to, first off, create a folder.\n\n182\n00:09:19.403 --> 00:09:21.490\nAnd I'm gonna call it,\nthis is will be my manuscript.\n\n183\n00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.050\nSo this is gonna be Don's Great\nAmerican Novel that I'm gonna write.\n\n184\n00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.350\nAnd I'll put file.txt in it.\n\n185\n00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.246\nAnd this folder will contain all\nthe stuff that I want to distribute out.\n\n186\n00:09:30.246 --> 00:09:34.400\nSo I might have 100 files in here,\nyou just put whatever, right.\n\n187\n00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.160\nAnd then, you can jump into Disk Utility.\n\n188\n00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.780\nI know that seems weird, the other one I\njust right-clicked and chose to compress,\n\n189\n00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.490\nbut here I gotta go to Disk Utility\nbecause I'm creating a fake hard drive.\n\n190\n00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.280\nAnd where better to do that\nthan in the Disk Utility?\n\n191\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.550\nAnd so, in the Disk Utility,\n\n192\n00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.990\nyou actually don't see anything related\nto disk images right here in the main UI.\n\n193\n00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.470\nBut if I go up here to my\nDisk Utility menu, and\n\n194\n00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.370\nI go to File, you can create a new image.\n\n195\n00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.150\nAnd that new image is a DMG.\n\n196\n00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.830\nI'm gonna create a new image.\n\n197\n00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.690\nNow I can create a blank one that's\njust empty, and I can copy stuff to it.\n\n198\n00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:07.920\nOr I can say Image from Folder.\n\n199\n00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.190\nAnd I'm gonna choose Image from Folder.\n\n200\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.410\nAnd I'm going to take my manuscript\nfolder, the one on my desktop.\n\n201\n00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.512\nI've got two manuscript folders.\n\n202\n00:10:14.512 --> 00:10:18.498\nI'm gonna take that folder right there and\nI'm going to open that up,\n\n203\n00:10:18.498 --> 00:10:21.930\nand it's gonna start to create a DMG.\n\n204\n00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.410\nNow, I've got some choices I'm going\nto have to make when I define this, and\n\n205\n00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.728\nthe choices make a big difference, okay.\n\n206\n00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:31.977\nWhat it's gonna create\nhere is the default, and\n\n207\n00:10:31.977 --> 00:10:37.142\nthe default DMG doesn't have a size\nlimit and compresses things by default.\n\n208\n00:10:37.142 --> 00:10:42.044\nAnd so I am gonna come in here and\nI'll just say, save as,\n\n209\n00:10:42.044 --> 00:10:46.245\nI'll call this Manuscript- Default, right.\n\n210\n00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:49.052\nAnd it's got the folder\nthat I wanna compress and\n\n211\n00:10:49.052 --> 00:10:51.170\nthe encryption I can encrypt it.\n\n212\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.140\nJust like a regular hard drive,\nI can encrypt this too.\n\n213\n00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.670\nNow, if I distribute it and\nit's encrypted, I've got to tell people\n\n214\n00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.820\nthe key, and that comes with\na little bit of a challenge there.\n\n215\n00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.610\nBut otherwise,\nit's gonna create this compressed image.\n\n216\n00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.310\nAnd I can hit Save.\n\n217\n00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:04.990\nAnd it's gonna save it.\n\n218\n00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.560\nAnd once it's done, I'll have an image\nthat contains the data that we want.\n\n219\n00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.640\nSo there we go, operation successful.\n\n220\n00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.040\nAnd let's browse and\nsee what we've done, all right.\n\n221\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.398\nSo now, I've got Manuscript- Default.dmg.\n\n222\n00:11:18.398 --> 00:11:21.850\nI'm gonna put that on my desktop so\nI don't lose it.\n\n223\n00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:26.619\nAnd, if I pull up its information,\nhere it is, and it's 27 KB.\n\n224\n00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:30.850\nNow, when I zipped it,\nit was less than 1 KB.\n\n225\n00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.170\nBut when I made a disc image,\nit still got smaller.\n\n226\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.561\nIt was 61 KB, now it's only 27 KB.\n\n227\n00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:38.090\nIt got smaller, but not as small.\n\n228\n00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.638\nAnd the reason is there's\nsome overhead here.\n\n229\n00:11:39.638 --> 00:11:42.773\nWhen you create a disc image,\nit's creating a fake hard drive, and\n\n230\n00:11:42.773 --> 00:11:43.655\nthat takes space.\n\n231\n00:11:43.655 --> 00:11:46.670\nSo now, I'm at 27 KB.\n\n232\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.110\nThe text file itself is probably\ncompressed very, very small.\n\n233\n00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.450\nAnd the rest is just\noverhead from the image, so,\n\n234\n00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.510\nit still looks to be a bit bigger, right.\n\n235\n00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.120\nBut I now got that disc image, and\nit's storing my file right there.\n\n236\n00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.530\nAnd if I mount that, if I double click\non it, it's gonna mount that disc image.\n\n237\n00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.449\nAnd when it's done, I'll have this\nvirtual hard drive sitting on my desktop,\n\n238\n00:12:06.449 --> 00:12:08.974\nwhich if I browse into it,\nthere's my file.txt.\n\n239\n00:12:08.974 --> 00:12:11.640\nAnd if I look at that, it's 61 KB.\n\n240\n00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.220\nIt's mounted, the compression is now\nremoved, and we can see it and access it.\n\n241\n00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.110\nAll right, now that's if I\ndo the front folder option.\n\n242\n00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.980\nBut I mentioned that I can create\nan image that was just empty, and\n\n243\n00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.890\nI can put things in it afterwards.\n\n244\n00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:28.220\nAnd here's where we get the most\ncontrol of the disk image that we make.\n\n245\n00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.828\nSo for example, if I come in here and\ncreate a new disk image.\n\n246\n00:12:30.828 --> 00:12:34.880\nSo I'm gonna go back up to my File menu,\nand New Image, and\n\n247\n00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.020\nthis time I'm gonna do a new Blank Image.\n\n248\n00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.737\nThere's a lot of choices in here\nthat we didn't see a minute ago, so\n\n249\n00:12:39.737 --> 00:12:42.710\nI want to walk you through these\nchoices and what each one means.\n\n250\n00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:49.430\nI'm gonna create one here, and\nI'm gonna call it Manuscript- Manual.\n\n251\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.210\nAll right, so\nthis is a manual image that I'm creating.\n\n252\n00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.760\nAnd it's gonna create it, it wants to\ncreate it in the Manuscript folder,\n\n253\n00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.050\nI'm gonna move it up\nto my Desktop instead.\n\n254\n00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.250\nAnd now, what do I want to call it?\n\n255\n00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.505\nNow, the name.\n\n256\n00:13:01.505 --> 00:13:02.875\nThis is not the name of a file,\n\n257\n00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:05.365\nthe name of the file's right up here,\nManuscript- Manual.\n\n258\n00:13:05.365 --> 00:13:07.205\nThis is the name that people\nwill see when they open it.\n\n259\n00:13:07.205 --> 00:13:09.918\nIt'll have a little descriptor,\nwhen they mount it the virtual drive will\n\n260\n00:13:09.918 --> 00:13:11.695\nhave a name, and\nthat's what I'm typing here.\n\n261\n00:13:11.695 --> 00:13:13.937\nSo I'm just gonna call this Manuscript,\nall right.\n\n262\n00:13:13.937 --> 00:13:15.833\nAnd then, I specify size.\n\n263\n00:13:15.833 --> 00:13:19.177\nThis is a virtual hard drive,\nhow big do I want the hard drive to be?\n\n264\n00:13:19.177 --> 00:13:21.244\nNow it's defaulting to 100 MB.\n\n265\n00:13:21.244 --> 00:13:22.243\nI'm gonna leave it at that, right.\n\n266\n00:13:22.243 --> 00:13:26.780\nSo I'm gonna create a 100 MB hard drive,\nand I'm gonna be able to put data in it.\n\n267\n00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.119\nWell a hard drive has to have a format,\nand so\n\n268\n00:13:29.119 --> 00:13:31.940\nit's gonna format it\nOS X Extended (Journaled).\n\n269\n00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.260\nI could format it as ExFat or FAT, but\nDMGs aren't recognized by Windows anyway,\n\n270\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.320\nso I'm just gonna keep it as\nit was X Extended (Journaled).\n\n271\n00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.710\nI can choose to encrypt it,\nlike we saw a moment ago.\n\n272\n00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.630\nAnd because it's a virtual hard drive,\nI can partition it.\n\n273\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.550\nYou can partition it and\n\n274\n00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.040\ndivide it up, and have partitions inside\nof this fake hard drive if you want.\n\n275\n00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.522\nIt's really treated like\nan actual hard drive.\n\n276\n00:13:54.522 --> 00:13:57.850\nBut what's truly important is this\nguy right here, the Image Format.\n\n277\n00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.402\nThe default is that it's gonna\ncreate a read/write disk image, and\n\n278\n00:14:01.402 --> 00:14:04.108\nyou'll see there's several\nother choices for me.\n\n279\n00:14:04.108 --> 00:14:06.488\nI'm gonna stick with the default, we'll\ncome back to the other ones in a minute.\n\n280\n00:14:06.488 --> 00:14:08.520\nread/write disk image.\n\n281\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.045\nI need to make a disk image so\nI can put files into it, okay.\n\n282\n00:14:12.045 --> 00:14:14.832\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nsave that, and create it.\n\n283\n00:14:14.832 --> 00:14:17.200\nAnd once it creates it, there we go.\n\n284\n00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:24.073\nAnd so on my desktop,\nI now have Manuscript- Manual.dmg.\n\n285\n00:14:24.073 --> 00:14:26.023\nHere's the one that I used\nwith just the defaults, right,\n\n286\n00:14:26.023 --> 00:14:28.750\nwhere I whipped through and\ntold it to make an image of that folder.\n\n287\n00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.520\nHere's the one I just did manually.\n\n288\n00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.602\nWell the manual one is empty,\nthere's nothing in it.\n\n289\n00:14:32.602 --> 00:14:35.179\nIf I double click on it,\nit's gonna mount it, and so\n\n290\n00:14:35.179 --> 00:14:38.590\nI'll see it get mounted over here,\nand it's empty.\n\n291\n00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:43.000\nBut it's a read/write image so I can take\nmy manuscript, I can just drag it and\n\n292\n00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.390\ndrop it, and now I've written to\nit just like any old hard drive,\n\n293\n00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.320\nand it's got my manuscript in there.\n\n294\n00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.806\nSo now I can take Manuscript.Manual,\nand I can send it to other people, but\n\n295\n00:14:52.806 --> 00:14:54.431\nI need to unmount it first.\n\n296\n00:14:54.431 --> 00:14:58.490\nSo let me come over here, and I'll take\nboth these guys, and unmount them.\n\n297\n00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.480\nWe'll just get rid of them.\n\n298\n00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.230\n>> Don, would you say the biggest\nadvantage to using the DMG, over\n\n299\n00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.180\nthe archiving the .ZIPs, is that the fact\nthat you can create this manual one and\n\n300\n00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.690\nstart slamming things in and\nout of it as you like?\n\n301\n00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:10.690\n>> Yes and no.\n\n302\n00:15:12.055 --> 00:15:15.440\nIf I'm gonna distribute something to other\nMacs, the DMG works out really well.\n\n303\n00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.560\nYou can use it with automation\nutilities an all that stuff.\n\n304\n00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.910\nBut DMGs really aren't recognized by\nthe rest of the Windows, Linux, and\n\n305\n00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:22.700\nUnix world.\n\n306\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.220\nIt really is just Apple that uses those,\nnobody else does.\n\n307\n00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.680\nThe other people have software that can\nopen them, but it's not really designed.\n\n308\n00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.559\nSo, I use .ZIPs when I want compatibility.\n\n309\n00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:35.540\nWhen I want anybody to be able\nto open this, I use a .ZIP.\n\n310\n00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.359\nBut if it's going to a Mac, I can use\nDMGs and it's easier to do scripts in\n\n311\n00:15:38.359 --> 00:15:41.148\nautomater to push these out to machines,\nand that's where I use them.\n\n312\n00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:43.150\nSo they kind of have a different purpose.\n\n313\n00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.799\nThey achieve the same goal, but\nhave a little bit different utility.\n\n314\n00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.791\nAlright now,\nI just unmounted that disk, and\n\n315\n00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:53.318\nthe only thing that I put into\nit was the manuscript, right.\n\n316\n00:15:53.318 --> 00:15:54.868\nSo let's take a look at these two files.\n\n317\n00:15:54.868 --> 00:15:58.690\nI've got Manuscript- Default,\nand Manuscript- Manual.\n\n318\n00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.310\nThis one I created with the wizard,\nthis one I created by hand.\n\n319\n00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:05.450\nAnd when I scroll over and\nlook at their sizes, look at the size.\n\n320\n00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:09.160\nThe one that was done through\nthe wizard is only 27K.\n\n321\n00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.060\nThe one I did by hand, it's 100 megabytes.\n\n322\n00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.230\n>> What did you do?\n\n323\n00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.390\n>> I know.\nI only put a 61 kilobyte file in there,\n\n324\n00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.320\nbut it's 100 megabytes in size.\n\n325\n00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.850\nWell, that's cuz I told it,\nit was 100 megabytes.\n\n326\n00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:26.300\nWhen you create a DMG it does\nnot do compression by default.\n\n327\n00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.390\nWhat it's doing is it's making\nan image of a hard drive.\n\n328\n00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.970\nA bit for bit copy of a hard drive.\n\n329\n00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.460\nSo if it's a 100 megabyte file and\n\n330\n00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.030\nthere's bits that are empty,\nit puts empty bits in the DMG.\n\n331\n00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.730\nIt is a bit for\nbit replica of a hard drive.\n\n332\n00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:41.730\nIt doesn't matter that the hard\ndrive didn't exist, right?\n\n333\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.710\nCuz I made a 100 megabit file from scratch\nbut it knows, hey that's empty space,\n\n334\n00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.000\nI'm gonna leave it empty.\n\n335\n00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.530\nOn a positive side, I said I can store\n100 megabytes in there, and because it's\n\n336\n00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:55.360\nalready consuming 100 megabytes, I will\ndefinitely be able to store it in there.\n\n337\n00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.270\nFirst is if it was smaller,\nit would have to grow and\n\n338\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.100\nmaybe there's not enough\nroom on the real hard drive.\n\n339\n00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.210\nThat might happen, right,\nso that's a benefit.\n\n340\n00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:05.130\nBut on the negative side, the 61\nkilobyte file I want to distribute, or\n\n341\n00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.120\nkilobyte is now 100 megabytes.\n\n342\n00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.500\nIt's now an order of magnitude larger,\nseveral orders of magnitude larger.\n\n343\n00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.935\n>> Not attaching that to an email,\nare you?\n\n344\n00:17:13.935 --> 00:17:16.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's too big.\n\n345\n00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:21.170\nSo when I create a DMZ by hand, we can\nactually choose to compress it a bit,\n\n346\n00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.310\nand it's not true compression.\n\n347\n00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:27.120\nIt's not compressing it in terms of zip,\nwhere it applies an algorithm and\n\n348\n00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.250\nshrinks the data.\n\n349\n00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.670\nInstead it's just trimming\noff the empty space.\n\n350\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.690\nIt's saying, hey, there's empty space in\nthis image, don't treat that as data.\n\n351\n00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.220\nAll right?\n\n352\n00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:40.100\nSo let me go back and do this and create\none that is, I'm gonna call it compressed.\n\n353\n00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.010\nNow, it's not called compressed.\n\n354\n00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.800\nIt's called a sparse bundle or\nsparse disk.\n\n355\n00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.420\nA sparse disk is where we only\nstore what truly has data,\n\n356\n00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.340\nwe don't store empty space.\n\n357\n00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.400\nAnd so that's why they call it\na sparse disk or a sparse bundle.\n\n358\n00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.450\nSo, if I go back into my disk manager,\nor Disk Utility, and\n\n359\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.240\nI'll go to File and New Image.\n\n360\n00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.780\nAnd I'll create a blank image,\njust like I did before.\n\n361\n00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:08.380\nAnd I'm gonna call this\none Manuscript-Sparse.\n\n362\n00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.190\nAll right, I'll put it on my desktop.\n\n363\n00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.030\nI'll call it Manuscript,\njust like I did the other ones.\n\n364\n00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:17.180\nI'm gonna leave it at 100 MB,\njust like I did before, only this time,\n\n365\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.850\ndown here under Image Format,\nI'm gonna drop that down.\n\n366\n00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.980\nThere's three different formats\nI can choose from here.\n\n367\n00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.740\nThere's the read write disk image,\nthat's what I did last time.\n\n368\n00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.980\nThere's a DVD or CD master.\n\n369\n00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.750\nIf you're gonna be burning a disk out\nof this, you can create that CD or\n\n370\n00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:30.350\nDVD master.\n\n371\n00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.890\nNot many people do that any more.\n\n372\n00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:36.110\nAnd then the other two, sparse disk image,\nsparse bundle disk image.\n\n373\n00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.730\nOkay.\n\n374\n00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.520\nA sparse bundle disk image is\nwhere I'm gathering up a folder.\n\n375\n00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.180\nA sparse disk image is where\nI'm imaging an actual disk.\n\n376\n00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.136\nI can actually choose either one\nof these and it'll work, but\n\n377\n00:18:44.136 --> 00:18:46.300\nI'm just going to do the sparse bundle.\n\n378\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.310\nSo I'll choose the sparse\nbundle on this one.\n\n379\n00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:52.770\nAnd it's going to create for\nme a 100 megabyte drive that is sparse.\n\n380\n00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.130\nAnd so I'm going to save that.\n\n381\n00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.330\nSo it's creating it right now.\n\n382\n00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.260\nAnd then I'll see it on my desktop.\n\n383\n00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.280\nSo now I've got this one.\n\n384\n00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.820\nNow notice it doesn't end in .dmg.\n\n385\n00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.650\nIt ends in sparsebundle.\n\n386\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.320\nOkay.\nCuz that's what I chose.\n\n387\n00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.480\nWell I'm just gonna rename that because\nI don't want people to realize that it's\n\n388\n00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.240\nsomething different.\n\n389\n00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.730\nI'm just gonna rename it .dmg.\n\n390\n00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.420\nOkay, and it's gonna warn me changing\nextension of a file can cause craziness\n\n391\n00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.710\nbut in the end, it is a dmg.\n\n392\n00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.710\nThe only difference is that it's\njust a sparse bundle instead.\n\n393\n00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.060\nOkay, so I'm gonna rename it so\nit's the same.\n\n394\n00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:26.090\nI'm gonna open that file up and\nit's going to be empty, right.\n\n395\n00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.750\nSo it's empty.\n\n396\n00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:27.950\nThere's nothing in it.\n\n397\n00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:31.898\nI'm going to copy my manuscript in\nthere so let me go find my manuscript.\n\n398\n00:19:31.898 --> 00:19:33.010\nAnd I'm gonna copy it in there so\n\n399\n00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.220\nthat my sparsebundle actually\nhas some data in it, right.\n\n400\n00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.230\nSo there it goes.\nNow its got my manuscript and\n\n401\n00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.240\nI'm gonna unmount it.\n\n402\n00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:45.250\nSo let me just take that and\neject it and get it out of there.\n\n403\n00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.120\nAnd when I'm done,\n\n404\n00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.810\nI've got my Manuscript- Devault.dmg,\nthat one I created with the wizard.\n\n405\n00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:57.537\nI've got my Manuscript- Manual.dmg,\nwhich is the one I created manually, and\n\n406\n00:19:57.537 --> 00:20:00.430\nthen lastly the Sparse one\nthat I also created manually.\n\n407\n00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:05.570\nNow the manual one was 100 megs but\nthe sparse one, 20 megs.\n\n408\n00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:06.220\nOkay.\n\n409\n00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.510\nBecause all the empty space at the end it\nremoved and now I just have a little bit\n\n410\n00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.155\nof overhead and\nit ended up being 20 megabytes in size.\n\n411\n00:20:12.155 --> 00:20:14.240\nIt's still way bigger than\nit should be though, right?\n\n412\n00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.450\nIt should have been a lot smaller but\ninstead it's got overhead\n\n413\n00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:23.020\nfrom being a dmg but it's got my files\nin it and now it's 20 megabytes in size.\n\n414\n00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.570\nIt didn't compress the data it just\ntrimmed off the empty space and so\n\n415\n00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.730\nit still ended up larger.\n\n416\n00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:32.190\nThe first way that I ran it boy\nthat was the best because it knew,\n\n417\n00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:38.010\nhey this is a folder I don't need\nto store a fake partition table.\n\n418\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.290\nI don't need to store all this stuff\nthat a hard drive normally uses.\n\n419\n00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.180\nI can just store the folder.\n\n420\n00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.280\nAnd that's the best way to do it.\n\n421\n00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.618\nYou end up with a nice small file that's\ndoing compression and minimizing overhead\n\n422\n00:20:47.618 --> 00:20:50.811\nversus the other ways where you're going\nto end up with a file that's pretty big\n\n423\n00:20:50.811 --> 00:20:54.330\nkinda no matter what you do to it and\nit ends up being a pretty decent size.\n\n424\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.750\nAll right, but the zip file, that was the\none that got me the best results, right?\n\n425\n00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.140\nWhich I guess I deleted my zip.\n\n426\n00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.930\nSo if I were to just take that\nmanual folder and compress it.\n\n427\n00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.421\nSo I'm gonna compress manuscript, and so\n\n428\n00:21:06.421 --> 00:21:11.017\nnow it's my manuscript-archive\nthat was the best one.\n\n429\n00:21:11.017 --> 00:21:14.297\nI was at 1 KB on that one Versus 27,\n100, or\n\n430\n00:21:14.297 --> 00:21:17.904\n20.3 megs,\neach one getting larger and larger.\n\n431\n00:21:17.904 --> 00:21:19.509\nWell I guess that one's not larger.\n\n432\n00:21:19.509 --> 00:21:20.809\nI figure I'll sort it by size,\nthere we go.\n\n433\n00:21:20.809 --> 00:21:22.380\nSo we'll make it get that way.\n\n434\n00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.870\nSo that zip, that gave me the best\nresults for individual files, right.\n\n435\n00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.390\nSo that's kinda\nthe difference we got there.\n\n436\n00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.450\n>> The right tool,\nright method for the job.\n\n437\n00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.330\nYou've got a couple of\noptions available for you.\n\n438\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.880\nSo, if you learn each one,\n\n439\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.930\nthen you'll be able to use the correct one\nat the right time for your environment.\n\n440\n00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.560\nDon, very cool stuff,\nand very helpful stuff.\n\n441\n00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.490\nIt seems like nowadays,\nit's two gigs, big deal.\n\n442\n00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.998\nBut size is still\na really important thing,\n\n443\n00:21:44.998 --> 00:21:48.000\nespecially when it comes to things like\nwhat you were talking about before.\n\n444\n00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.290\nEmail attachments, there are still\nlimits to those types of things.\n\n445\n00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:56.050\nSo, knowing how to make it a little bit\nsmaller, make it a little easier to\n\n446\n00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:59.200\ntransfer, make it easier for\nsomebody else to get it from you.\n\n447\n00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.090\nIt's still a viable option.\n\n448\n00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:04.200\n>> Yeah, absolutely it's there, and people\nare gonna send you these files, too.\n\n449\n00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.770\nWhen you download programs,\nyou're downloading DMGs.\n\n450\n00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:09.530\nWhat if you work for\na company that you're a developer?\n\n451\n00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.300\nYou need to create your own DMGs.\n\n452\n00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.820\nYou've got the tools, they're right there.\n\n453\n00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.340\nThere's third party utilities\nthat can do it, too.\n\n454\n00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.910\nThere's plenty of them, I know I\nuse a program called Entropy a lot.\n\n455\n00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.540\nBut for the exam you need to know\nwhat's built into the operating system.\n\n456\n00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.180\nSo those are the tools\nthat are right there.\n\n457\n00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.140\n>> Really cool stuff though Don,\nwe thank you for stopping by.\n\n458\n00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.260\nIs there anything else that you wanna add\nto this program before we wrap it up?\n\n459\n00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:26.820\n>> That's about it.\n\n460\n00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.180\nI know we've been going on about files for\nlike four episodes now.\n\n461\n00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.746\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think we've pretty much run through\n\n462\n00:22:30.746 --> 00:22:31.777\nall the different options there.\n\n463\n00:22:31.777 --> 00:22:34.189\nBut it is key stuff to note things\nthat you'll encounter out there in\n\n464\n00:22:34.189 --> 00:22:34.793\nthe real world.\n\n465\n00:22:34.793 --> 00:22:36.390\n>> All right,\nwell thanks again for stopping by.\n\n466\n00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:37.740\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n467\n00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.730\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n468\n00:22:39.730 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.030\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.420\nIn today's episode, we are continuing\non with our Apple certified support\n\n5\n00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.450\nprofessional series that\nwe've been working on.\n\n6\n00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.025\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nis our good friend Dr. Emitt Brown.\n\n7\n00:00:27.025 --> 00:00:29.550\n[LAUGH] Welcome to the show, Dr. Brown.\n\n8\n00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.520\nHow's it going today, Don?\n\n9\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.680\n>> It's going just swell, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.930\nThanks for having me back on the show.\n\n11\n00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.700\nAnd yep,\nit's back to the future time, right?\n\n12\n00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.540\nBecause we're gonna be jumping in\nthe time machine in this episode and\n\n13\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.470\nlooking at how to back up our macs,\nhow to restore our macs, and\n\n14\n00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.890\nsome of the different ins and\nouts that are involved in that.\n\n15\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.440\nSome of the things that are behind\nthe scenes that we don't normally pay\n\n16\n00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.040\nattention to, but\n\n17\n00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.042\nwe're gonna get a chance to see them\nright here and see it in action.\n\n18\n00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:53.070\nNow most of you are probably\npretty familiar with time machine.\n\n19\n00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.350\nApple's been promoting\nthis pretty heavily.\n\n20\n00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.360\nIt's a great feature.\n\n21\n00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.770\nIt's gotta be one of the easiest to use\nbackup systems that I've worked with, and\n\n22\n00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.220\nI've worked with a lot of them in\nthe Windows world and the Linux world.\n\n23\n00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.300\nBackups are always a nightmare.\n\n24\n00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.090\nTime Machine is specifically designed to\nmake back up super easy, super convenient,\n\n25\n00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.820\nbecause Apple knows that if you don't\nmake it easy, people aren't gonna do it.\n\n26\n00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.180\nAnd if people don't do it,\neventually they have a failure and\n\n27\n00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.260\nboy do they regret that.\n\n28\n00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.290\nI can't tell you the horror\nstories I've seen over the years.\n\n29\n00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.330\nWay back in the beginning of my IT career,\n\n30\n00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.110\nI started out doing warranty repairs for\na company.\n\n31\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.000\nWell, do you remember Packard Bell?\n\n32\n00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.860\n>> Yes, I do.\n>> So, I was doing warranty repair for\n\n33\n00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.420\nPackard Bell and if you remember\nthe company you know I was a busy person.\n\n34\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.090\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because those were terrible computers,\n\n35\n00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.870\nso we had this lady came in one day and\nshe was a doctoral\n\n36\n00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.690\nstudent at the university in town and she\nhad her doctoral, I want to say, thesis.\n\n37\n00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.960\n>> Dissertation.\n>> Dissertation, that's it.\n\n38\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.293\nIt was her dissertation on her laptop and\nshe had dropped it and\n\n39\n00:01:51.293 --> 00:01:52.968\nit wouldn't power on.\n\n40\n00:01:52.968 --> 00:01:55.230\nAnd we open it up and\nsure enough it was a hard drive failure.\n\n41\n00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.580\nAnd so I had to tell her the drive is\ndead we can't get the data off of it.\n\n42\n00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.150\nDo you have a backup?\n\n43\n00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.800\nAnd she didn't.\n\n44\n00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.560\nShe didn't have a backup and\nthat was her doctoral dissertation.\n\n45\n00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.590\nThat was a big deal.\n\n46\n00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.140\nFortunately she was able to go\nto her her graduate advisor and\n\n47\n00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.050\nthey had a printed copy she had turned in\nas a draft not too long before, so she\n\n48\n00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.660\nlost some of her newer data, but she had\nto sit there and retype that whole thing.\n\n49\n00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.628\nAnd I saw it, it was a giant stack.\n\n50\n00:02:21.628 --> 00:02:23.248\nI mean, it was a massive amount of data.\n\n51\n00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:24.008\nIt was terrible.\n\n52\n00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:26.100\nIt could have been a lot worse,\nshe could have lost that.\n\n53\n00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.200\nThat was years of research and study.\n\n54\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.520\nSo, that's the type of thing you\ndon't want to have happen to you.\n\n55\n00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.730\nTime Machine helps prevent that.\n\n56\n00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.050\nAll right, well, let's take a look\nat how to get Time Machine set up.\n\n57\n00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.820\nAnd I'm gonna get a back\nup running on this machine.\n\n58\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.240\nAnd while the back up's running,\nwe'll talk about what it's doing and\n\n59\n00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.080\nhow it functions.\n\n60\n00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.360\nNow, the key secret here is that\nTime Machine is supposed to be easy.\n\n61\n00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.250\nAnd when I say easy,\nI mean it's really easy.\n\n62\n00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.100\nYou start off by getting\nan external hard drive.\n\n63\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.760\nYou want to have an external hard drive.\n\n64\n00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.620\nDon't try and\nback up to something inside your system,\n\n65\n00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.430\nbecause there's the potential\nyour system could be dead.\n\n66\n00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.190\nAnd you don't want to rely on\nthe hardware inside of it.\n\n67\n00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.960\nSo you get a removable drive.\n\n68\n00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.560\nWhen you plug it into the system,\n\n69\n00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.930\nthe system will immediately\nrecognize that drive.\n\n70\n00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.500\nAnd it will offer to turn on time machine\nfor you, just like that, just turn it on.\n\n71\n00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.308\nLet me show you here on this machine.\n\n72\n00:03:12.308 --> 00:03:16.758\nSo I've got a hard drive on this machine\nthat is not formatted right now, so\n\n73\n00:03:16.758 --> 00:03:21.580\nI'm gonna just jump into disc utility and\nI am going to take that hard drive, and\n\n74\n00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.320\nI'm just going to erase it, and\nI'll call this my Time Machine drive.\n\n75\n00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.870\nNow, it doesn't really\nmatter what you call it.\n\n76\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.860\nYou can name it anything,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n77\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.150\nI'm going to call it Time Machine, so\nI can remember that's what it is, right.\n\n78\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.590\nAnd then I'm going to format\nit OS X Extended (Journaled).\n\n79\n00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.540\nIt does need to be formatted\nOS X Extended (Journaled).\n\n80\n00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.030\nIf it's formated Fat 32 or XFat, or\nwhatever, it's not going to work.\n\n81\n00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.470\nNow If you plug in the drive,\nthe system will recognize it and\n\n82\n00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.530\noffer to set up Time Machine.\n\n83\n00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.330\nIf you choose yes and\nit's a different format, it'll erase it.\n\n84\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.530\nSo you'll lose the data that's on there.\n\n85\n00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.670\nYou don't want that.\n\n86\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.550\nBut usually, you want the drive to be\ndedicated for Time Machine anyway.\n\n87\n00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.600\nSo I'm gonna erase that.\n\n88\n00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.040\nAnd so there it goes, it's erasing it.\n\n89\n00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.980\nIt mounts it on the system.\n\n90\n00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.490\nAnd I immediately get\nthis popup right here.\n\n91\n00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.386\nHey, we just noticed you've\nput in a new hard drive.\n\n92\n00:04:04.386 --> 00:04:06.246\nDo you wanna use it for Time Machine?\n\n93\n00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.826\nIt's got 274 gigs of storage space on it.\n\n94\n00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:11.280\nWe can use it to back\nup with Time Machine.\n\n95\n00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.070\nLet's do it.\n\n96\n00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.520\nAll right, now, if we do it, it's\ngonna start immediately using this for\n\n97\n00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.740\nTime Machine, and all I have to do is\nclick this little button right here,\n\n98\n00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.460\nUse as Backup Disk, and I'm done.\n\n99\n00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.160\nIt's the simplest thing in the plant.\n\n100\n00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.390\nNow if you've already got a hard\ndrive that you've been using and\n\n101\n00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.490\nyou don't get this little pop up.\n\n102\n00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.050\nI'm just going to say decide later,\nor no I'll say don't use.\n\n103\n00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.870\nDon't use it for Time Machine.\n\n104\n00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.870\nSo now I've just got a second\nhard drive added here, and\n\n105\n00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.830\nwhile I did name it Time Machine,\nthe name doesn't really mean anything.\n\n106\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.550\nSo it's just a removable drive.\n\n107\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.870\nSo I've got this removable drive attached.\n\n108\n00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.920\nAnd If I browse into a regular hard drive,\nnothing special here.\n\n109\n00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.390\nBut I can turn on Time Machine whenever I\nwant, by going into my system preferences\n\n110\n00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.120\nand finding Time Machine\nin my system preferences.\n\n111\n00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.450\nSo when that pops up,\nyou can kind of scan around and\n\n112\n00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.020\nfind it way down here at the bottom.\n\n113\n00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.040\nA little green clock is\nwhat we're looking for.\n\n114\n00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.420\nAnd when you click on that it's\ngonna fire up time machine and\n\n115\n00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.540\nthere's really just two steps.\n\n116\n00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.790\nOne, you pick the drive you want to\nback up to, and two, you turn it on.\n\n117\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.870\nIt's designed to be that easy.\n\n118\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.130\nSo I'm gonna select a back up disk and\nI'm gonna pick that USB hard drive.\n\n119\n00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.320\nNow, notice I see more than\njust the USB hard drive,\n\n120\n00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.610\nI also see an Airport Time Capsule.\n\n121\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.810\nAnd you may even see other\nthings in your list.\n\n122\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.648\nTypically we're gonna back\nto our hard drive, right?\n\n123\n00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:33.470\nBut what's the weakness there?\n\n124\n00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.485\nThe weakness is, I have to remember\nto plug that hard drive in.\n\n125\n00:05:36.485 --> 00:05:37.920\nWell, I have a laptop.\n\n126\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.960\nSo when I leave here\nat the end of the day,\n\n127\n00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.410\nI'm gonna unplug that hard drive and\nam gonna go home.\n\n128\n00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.670\nWhen I come in the next day, I've got to\nremember to plug that hard drive in again.\n\n129\n00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.660\nWhat if I forget to plug it in?\n\n130\n00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.040\nThen Time Machine can't back up my system,\nright?\n\n131\n00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.160\nSo when you deal with a removable drive,\nyour chore,\n\n132\n00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.297\nyour assignment is to make sure that drive\nis plugged in, so it can run its back ups.\n\n133\n00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.215\nIf you know you're not good at that.\n\n134\n00:05:59.215 --> 00:06:00.465\nPeople recognize their weaknesses.\n\n135\n00:06:00.465 --> 00:06:03.670\n>> John, we don't have wireless\ndata transfer to hard drives now?\n\n136\n00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.165\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's not there,\n\n137\n00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:06.295\nyou have a USB Drive, or\n\n138\n00:06:06.295 --> 00:06:09.395\na Thunderbolt drive, it's kinda\ngotta be plugged in for it to work.\n\n139\n00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:14.415\nSo, if you recognize that weakness in the\nsolution here, there's other alternatives.\n\n140\n00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:16.255\nYou can buy an Airport Time Capsule.\n\n141\n00:06:16.255 --> 00:06:19.775\nAnd what an Airport is,\nis one of Apple's wireless access points,\n\n142\n00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:22.490\nit's really an Airport Extreme.\n\n143\n00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.880\nBut it's got hard drives in it.\n\n144\n00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.520\nIt'll have two hard,\n\n145\n00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.410\nwell it depends on how you buy it\nit might have one hard drive, but\n\n146\n00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.070\nusually it has two hard drives in it.\n\n147\n00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.350\nAnd it'll give you one or\ntwo terabytes of storage.\n\n148\n00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.040\nWell, as of the filming of this episode,\nby the time you've watched this episode,\n\n149\n00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.860\nmaybe they've introduced more.\n\n150\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.510\nBut right now you can get it with one or\ntwo terabytes and it's on your network.\n\n151\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.710\nIt's on your wireless.\n\n152\n00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.540\nSo when you bring your\nlaptop into the office and\n\n153\n00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.480\nyou connect to that wireless network,\nit sees those drives and\n\n154\n00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.960\nit can start backing up, you don't\nhave to remember to plug in anything.\n\n155\n00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.910\nYou just have to remember to turn your\ncomputer on, which you're going to do,\n\n156\n00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.430\nunless you like looking at\na black screen all day.\n\n157\n00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.550\nSo that makes it super easy.\n\n158\n00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.450\nThere is a third option\nthat I don't see here,\n\n159\n00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.840\nwhich is you might have\na server on your network.\n\n160\n00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.350\nIf you have an El Capitan box\nthat's running the server app,\n\n161\n00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.030\nyou can set it up to be a central\ntime machine back up server.\n\n162\n00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.670\nAnd you would see the server right\nhere and you could click on that and\n\n163\n00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.130\nchoose to back up to the server.\n\n164\n00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.670\nAgain, just like the AirPort, all you\nhave to do is connect to the network.\n\n165\n00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.150\nAnd once you're on the network,\nthe back up happens automatically.\n\n166\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.310\nSo that makes it a lot easier on us.\n\n167\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.250\nBut for this machine, I'm just gonna\nuse this internal drive because\n\n168\n00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.280\nnetwork back ups are slower, right.\n\n169\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.430\nYour internal drives or your USB drives,\nyou could write to those pretty fast.\n\n170\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.860\nBut when you start going over the network\nthings are a little bit slower, and\n\n171\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.500\nI don't want this show\nto be a 10 hour show.\n\n172\n00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.390\nSo I'm just going to go with\nthe regular local drive.\n\n173\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.260\nNow when I choose it, I do have\nthe choice to encrypt the back ups.\n\n174\n00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.990\nWhy is that important?\n\n175\n00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.491\nWell, if I have a back up drive,\nlike this guy right here,\n\n176\n00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:46.788\nthis is the back up of my laptop,\nof my actual laptop that I use for work.\n\n177\n00:07:46.788 --> 00:07:50.330\nAnd so this is my data, right?\n\n178\n00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.649\nI've got my personal email backed up,\nin my laptop, this is a back up of it.\n\n179\n00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:58.167\nSo I plug this in everyday and\nI back up my Time Machine right here.\n\n180\n00:07:58.167 --> 00:07:59.710\nThis is my Time Machine back up.\n\n181\n00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.162\nWhat if you were to steal this drive?\n\n182\n00:08:01.162 --> 00:08:03.565\nIf you were to come and\ngrab this drive and take it home,\n\n183\n00:08:03.565 --> 00:08:05.680\nyou could plug it into any Mac.\n\n184\n00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.925\nYou could boot to recovery.\n\n185\n00:08:06.925 --> 00:08:09.700\nYou could choose Restore\nfrom Time Machine Backup.\n\n186\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.110\nAnd when you do it,\nyou're gonna restore a copy of my data.\n\n187\n00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.904\nAnd now you've got all of\nmy information right there.\n\n188\n00:08:16.904 --> 00:08:19.791\nYou don't even have to restore it, you\ncould just plug this into a computer and\n\n189\n00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.500\nbrowse right into the drive and\nthere's all my data.\n\n190\n00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.250\nI don't want that.\n\n191\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:23.901\nBelieve it or not.\n\n192\n00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:25.484\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm pretty-\n\n193\n00:08:25.484 --> 00:08:26.839\n>> Say it ain't so, Don.\n\n194\n00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.412\n>> I'm pretty open about sharing\ninformation with people but\n\n195\n00:08:29.412 --> 00:08:32.310\nthere's gonna be something on here,\nI'm sure.\n\n196\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.228\nMaybe tax returns, I don't know,\nsomething like that.\n\n197\n00:08:34.228 --> 00:08:36.060\nYou don't want get that getting out.\n\n198\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.290\nThis data is sensitive.\n\n199\n00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.714\nIt might be work data, it might be\nemployee records, like payroll data.\n\n200\n00:08:41.714 --> 00:08:46.600\nIt could be medical records, financial\ndata, you don't want that getting out.\n\n201\n00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.120\nSo you can encrypt it, and that way if\nsomebody steals the drive, who cares?\n\n202\n00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.270\nThey stole it, doesn't matter,\nit's not gonna work, right?\n\n203\n00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.465\nAnd for you, because it's encrypted, it'll\nbe stored in your keychain, the password,\n\n204\n00:08:57.465 --> 00:08:59.808\nthe private key,\nwill be stored in your keychain so\n\n205\n00:08:59.808 --> 00:09:02.441\nit doesn't inconvenience you but\nyour data is now safe.\n\n206\n00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:05.216\nNow the only reason I'm not\ngonna check it here, is again,\n\n207\n00:09:05.216 --> 00:09:08.057\nI wanna get this done within\nthe time I have here in this show.\n\n208\n00:09:08.057 --> 00:09:09.370\nAnd if I encrypt it,\nit's gonna take longer.\n\n209\n00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.750\nSo I'll leave it unencrypted.\n\n210\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.722\nBut it's a no-brainer,\nin real life, you wanna encrypt it.\n\n211\n00:09:13.722 --> 00:09:15.788\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna choose that Time Machine disk.\n\n212\n00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:17.525\nAnd so now I've selected the disk.\n\n213\n00:09:17.525 --> 00:09:21.700\nAnd it automatically turned it on for\nme, it flipped the on switch.\n\n214\n00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.230\nI'm now set up for Time Machine, and\n\n215\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.460\nif you'll notice, the next backup\nis gonna happen in two minutes.\n\n216\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.910\nSo it immediately starts a time for\n\n217\n00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.570\ntwo minutes, and\nthen it's gonna start that first back up.\n\n218\n00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.820\nNow it didn't ask me\nwhen do I wanna back up.\n\n219\n00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.360\nIt didn't ask me what I wanna back up,\nit didn't ask me\n\n220\n00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.240\nall those other questions that if you if\nyou've ever set up Backup under Windows or\n\n221\n00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.300\nBackup under Linux, there's a ton\nof stuff you've gotta answer.\n\n222\n00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.060\nWell, Apple knew that most people\ndon't wanna deal with that, and so\n\n223\n00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.740\nthey made it really simple.\n\n224\n00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.240\nYou plug in the drive,\nyou turn it on, and it's done, okay?\n\n225\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.500\nWell, what did it actually do?\n\n226\n00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.090\nWell, it did a few things.\n\n227\n00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.470\nFirst off, it decided it was gonna\nbackup your entire hard drive.\n\n228\n00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.280\nIt didn't say,\ndo you want this folder or that folder?\n\n229\n00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.580\nLet's just get the whole hard drive.\n\n230\n00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:12.910\nIn the olden days, four years ago, we\ndidn't have as much storage as we do now.\n\n231\n00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:17.430\nSo when you had a laptop or a desktop that\nhad a bunch of storage, it was kind of\n\n232\n00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.670\nexpensive to get an extra hard drive\nthat mirrored the amount of storage so\n\n233\n00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.930\nyou could do backups.\n\n234\n00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.590\nBut in today's world, storage is cheap.\n\n235\n00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.960\nIf you've sprung for the extra money to\nget like a solid state drive inside of\n\n236\n00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.250\nyour Macbook, it costs a little\nbit extra but you get one.\n\n237\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.040\nMy laptop has a 500 gig SSD in it.\n\n238\n00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.899\nWell, I can go and get a 1 terabyte\nremovable drive, like this one.\n\n239\n00:10:37.899 --> 00:10:39.399\nThey're $70, $80,\n\n240\n00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:43.310\nI mean they're really inexpensive\ncompared to what they used to be.\n\n241\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.827\nSo, we can get tons of removable\nmedia that's very inexpensive.\n\n242\n00:10:47.827 --> 00:10:49.345\nAnd so with Time Machine,\nit just says hey,\n\n243\n00:10:49.345 --> 00:10:51.380\nlook let's back up the whole hard drive.\n\n244\n00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.872\nBy backing up the whole hard drive,\n\n245\n00:10:52.872 --> 00:10:56.280\nyou can guarantee that no matter what\nhappens you can recover your data.\n\n246\n00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.170\nIf I accidentally delete a file,\nI can recover that one file.\n\n247\n00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.000\nIf I accidentally delete an entire folder,\nI can recover that folder.\n\n248\n00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.300\nIf I accidentally damage my operating\nsystem or delete a user account,\n\n249\n00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.680\nI can restore the entire\ncomputer from that backup.\n\n250\n00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.200\nThat one backup covers me in\nall of those scenarios, and\n\n251\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.510\nit's all done automatically,\njust backs up the whole thing, all right?\n\n252\n00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.370\nNow the first time it runs the backup,\nwhat it's gonna do for me,\n\n253\n00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.670\nactually mine just started.\n\n254\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.050\nSo if we look at mine,\nit's backing up, and\n\n255\n00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.590\nyou can see I'm at a whopping 30 MB or\n60 MB now, of 10 gigs.\n\n256\n00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.550\nI've got 10 gigs of data it's backing up.\n\n257\n00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.710\nThe first backup is gonna take awhile,\nright.\n\n258\n00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.360\nSo it's telling me I got\n20 minutes remaining.\n\n259\n00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.220\nIt'll actually end up being less, but\nit's gonna churn through and do that.\n\n260\n00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.166\nSo, that first backup,\nit backs up all of your data.\n\n261\n00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:44.962\nI've got 10 gigs on my hard drive,\nright, if check my Macintosh HD and\n\n262\n00:11:44.962 --> 00:11:49.520\nI pull up its info and I look,\nit says here that I am currently using.\n\n263\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.066\nIt says I'm using 11.2 gigs, right?\n\n264\n00:11:52.066 --> 00:11:56.340\nSo it's gonna back up 11.2 gigs\nof data to this hard drive.\n\n265\n00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.520\nWell, see how it actually says 10.28 gigs,\n\n266\n00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:04.010\nwhat about that other 1 gigabyte\nof other data, where'd that go?\n\n267\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:08.639\nWell, that 1 GB of other data, it'll\nusually be things like a paging file,\n\n268\n00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:09.432\na swap file.\n\n269\n00:12:09.432 --> 00:12:11.880\nAnd that doesn't have data\nin it that's important.\n\n270\n00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.400\nWhen your system reboots that\ngets erased anyway and so\n\n271\n00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.850\nthere's no point in backing that up.\n\n272\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:20.120\nSo Time Machine is smart enough to exclude\ndata that doesn't need to be backed up.\n\n273\n00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.700\nBut the first back up\nis gonna take a while.\n\n274\n00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.960\nAnd so it's gonna run right now and\nback everything up.\n\n275\n00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.730\nNow while we're waiting on it,\nwe can go and\n\n276\n00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.560\nconfigure other things\nabout what it's backing up.\n\n277\n00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.580\nRight down here it's\ntelling us what it's doing.\n\n278\n00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:36.740\nIt's gonna do a backup every hour for\n24 hours.\n\n279\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.860\nSo it's doing a big backup right now,\na full backup, and\n\n280\n00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.540\nthen from now on,\nonce an hour it'll do a backup.\n\n281\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.961\nNow, if this backup is\ngonna take 20 minutes,\n\n282\n00:12:44.961 --> 00:12:47.806\ndoes that mean it's gonna\ntake 20 minutes every hour?\n\n283\n00:12:47.806 --> 00:12:51.870\nIn other words, what is that, like 33%\nof the time it's gonna be backing up?\n\n284\n00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.760\nWell, no, the first backup is big,\nit's gonna backup everything.\n\n285\n00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.750\nBut every backup after that is\nonly backing up what's changed.\n\n286\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.370\nSo how much data did you\nchange in the last hour?\n\n287\n00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:04.970\nThat's what it's gonna back up.\n\n288\n00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.710\nIf nothing changed at all in the last\nhour, then it backs up nothing.\n\n289\n00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.990\nAnd if I changed a handful of documents,\nit's just gonna back up those documents.\n\n290\n00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.361\nSo that's all it's gonna back up for\nthe course of that hour and\n\n291\n00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:17.569\nthen the next hour, and\nthe next hour, and the next hour.\n\n292\n00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:20.182\nAnd what that means is,\nif I accidentally delete a document,\n\n293\n00:13:20.182 --> 00:13:23.400\nI can jump back to the previous hour,\nand there's that document.\n\n294\n00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.930\nSo I can go back in one hour\nincrements to find missing data.\n\n295\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.950\n>> So, Don, are you saying that when,\nlet's say nothing has changed, right, and\n\n296\n00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.460\nyou said,\ndoes it actually not do a backup, or\n\n297\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.240\ndoes it create a backup of the backup,\nsaying, well nothing has changed, so\n\n298\n00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.730\nthat everything is still the same, but\nyou still have that hourly increment.\n\n299\n00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.170\n>> It does create the backup,\nit's just the backup is empty.\n\n300\n00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.502\n>> And so, when you go to look\nat the backup, you see it, but\n\n301\n00:13:44.502 --> 00:13:46.606\neverything looks the same\nas the previous backup.\n\n302\n00:13:46.606 --> 00:13:50.188\nIf you watched our episode where\nwe talked about hard links,\n\n303\n00:13:50.188 --> 00:13:53.786\nwe talked about aliases,\nsymbolic links, and hard links.\n\n304\n00:13:53.786 --> 00:13:55.600\nIt was in our file management episodes.\n\n305\n00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.140\nYour Time Machine backups,\n\n306\n00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.370\nthe first backup is actually copying\nthose files to the hard drive.\n\n307\n00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:04.216\nAnd then after that, for every backup\nwe take, if a file hasn't changed,\n\n308\n00:14:04.216 --> 00:14:07.830\nit just puts a hard link in there\nthat points to the original file.\n\n309\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.760\nSo it only has one copy of\na file unless it changes.\n\n310\n00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.020\nIf the file changes,\nthen we have two copies of it.\n\n311\n00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.808\nIf it changes again,\nnow we have three copies,\n\n312\n00:14:15.808 --> 00:14:18.570\nit maintains a copy of\neach changed version.\n\n313\n00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.795\nBut if the file is unchanged,\nthere's one copy, and\n\n314\n00:14:21.795 --> 00:14:24.430\nthen let's say you have\nten backups on the drive.\n\n315\n00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.810\nThere will be one copy and nine hard links\nthat all point to that same file, so\n\n316\n00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.500\nit doesn't occupy additional space.\n\n317\n00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.550\nAnd it doesn't back it up, so\n\n318\n00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.310\nit doesn't take any time,\nit happens instantly, all right?\n\n319\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.060\nSo you'll find your hourly backups\nrarely take more than a minute.\n\n320\n00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:38.750\nThey're normally very,\n\n321\n00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.670\nvery fast, because they just have to\nget what's changed, and that's it.\n\n322\n00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.757\nAll right, now, over time,\nas you make more and more and more change,\n\n323\n00:14:44.757 --> 00:14:46.511\neventually, your hard drive fills up.\n\n324\n00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.780\nRight, the hard drive that\nyou're using for Time Machine.\n\n325\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.110\nSo, what happens when\nthe hard drive fills up?\n\n326\n00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:55.020\nWell, it takes whatever is the oldest and\noverwrites it.\n\n327\n00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.226\nAnd so, it bumps old stuff\nto make room for new stuff.\n\n328\n00:14:58.226 --> 00:15:00.100\nNow, when does it happen?\n\n329\n00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.470\nDepends on how big your hard drive is,\nright?\n\n330\n00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.140\nIn my laptop, I've got a 500 gig drive.\n\n331\n00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.150\nMy external drive that I\nback up to is 1 terabyte.\n\n332\n00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.650\nSo in theory, I could change every single\nfile on my entire hard drive at least\n\n333\n00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.070\nonce, and I could have two\ncopies sitting on that drive.\n\n334\n00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.650\nBut if I started changing files more,\nthen I wouldn't be able to have more,\n\n335\n00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.450\nand so my changes would exceed\nthe size of the base data, and\n\n336\n00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.390\nnow I would have to delete old\nstuff to make room for new stuff.\n\n337\n00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.410\nBut the reality is, a ton of the data\non your hard drive never changes.\n\n338\n00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.300\nThink of your applications, right?\n\n339\n00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.690\nOS 10, all the operating system files,\napplications like Microsoft Word,\n\n340\n00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:35.900\nand Google Chrome, and so\n\n341\n00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.970\non, those don't really change\nexcept when new updates come down.\n\n342\n00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:43.250\nSo every hour they're not really changing,\nmaybe once a week they get an update,\n\n343\n00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.520\nor once a month they get an update,\nthen they change.\n\n344\n00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.906\nBut otherwise, they're the same, so\nthey don't really count towards your disk\n\n345\n00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:50.882\nspace, other than the original copy,\nright?\n\n346\n00:15:50.882 --> 00:15:54.612\nAnd you'll find you can store a ton, but\nwhat Apple does to help make sure you can\n\n347\n00:15:54.612 --> 00:15:57.465\ngo back as far as possible is\nthey'll do a backup every hour.\n\n348\n00:15:57.465 --> 00:16:01.006\nSo, that always happens, every hour,\nTime Machine runs a backup.\n\n349\n00:16:01.006 --> 00:16:05.320\nAnd it will save every hourly backup for\nthe last 24 hours.\n\n350\n00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:10.480\nSo for the last day,\nI can go back to each one-hour increment.\n\n351\n00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.670\nBut after that, if we look at the rest\nof the note here, daily backups for\n\n352\n00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.090\nthe past month.\n\n353\n00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.830\nSo for the past month,\nit saves one backup a day.\n\n354\n00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.100\nSo for the last 24 days,\nI can go back to any particular hour.\n\n355\n00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.730\nThen before that I can go\nback the last 30 days.\n\n356\n00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.830\nOne backup per day up to 30 days.\n\n357\n00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.130\nAnd then before that one backup a week for\n\n358\n00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.850\nas many months as will\nfit on the hard drive.\n\n359\n00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.540\nIt will go back to eternity if you've\ngot a massive enough drive, right?\n\n360\n00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.170\nSo if I hook up a like a 12\nterabyte storage rate on my laptop.\n\n361\n00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.560\nI could go back months,\nmaybe even years, on this thing.\n\n362\n00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.680\nOne backup a week, right?\n\n363\n00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.350\nSo, it does that to make sure it can\nget the most possible on that disk.\n\n364\n00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.450\nNow, this one is running\na backup right now,\n\n365\n00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.020\nso it's kind of hard to see but,\nlet me take my hard drive.\n\n366\n00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.620\nAnd my hard drive's not necessarily\nthe greatest [INAUDIBLE]\n\n367\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.810\nbecause I do format it from time to time\nbecause I use it for something else.\n\n368\n00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.600\nThen I just run a new backup\nwhen I hook it back up.\n\n369\n00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.020\nBut Let me hook this up\nto my computer here and\n\n370\n00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.930\nI'll show you my backups because\nthese have been running a while.\n\n371\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.850\nSo I wanna show you what that looks like.\n\n372\n00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:13.820\nSo, I'm gonna plug that in.\n\n373\n00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.930\nAnd so\nhere I am just on my regular laptop,\n\n374\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.130\nI just plugged in my Time Machine drive.\n\n375\n00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:18.720\nAnd, shoot.\n\n376\n00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.490\nDid it go to the VM?\n\n377\n00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:20.120\nWhere did it go?\n\n378\n00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.560\nWell, it's disappearing on me.\n\n379\n00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.810\nThere it is.\n>> There it is.\n\n380\n00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:28.160\n>> So here I am on my actual desktop and\nthere's my Time Machine hard drive.\n\n381\n00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.620\nAnd if I enter into Time Machine,\n\n382\n00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.980\nso I'm gonna jump into Time Machine,\nand you get this kind of weird view.\n\n383\n00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.650\nRight.\n\n384\n00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.790\nAnd what I'm seeing is my desktop.\n\n385\n00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.860\nI'm seeing my desktop and\nit's going back in time.\n\n386\n00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.480\nRight, these are copies of my\ndesktop from the previous backups.\n\n387\n00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.630\nAnd it's not just a desktop, so\nI can jump into my Show Notes folder and\n\n388\n00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:54.580\nI can browse into my Apple\ncertified Support 10.11.\n\n389\n00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:59.490\nHere's my Show Notes for this show,\nand I see it going back in time.\n\n390\n00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:04.560\nAnd I can look at these Show Notes\nas they were a week ago or\n\n391\n00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.300\na few days ago or\na few hours ago or so on, right?\n\n392\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.160\nI'm scrolling back in time.\n\n393\n00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.320\nAnd you can get a much better picture\nof that over here on the side.\n\n394\n00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.130\nAnd my head's gonna get in the way,\nwe'll have to bump me out.\n\n395\n00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:19.110\nBut if you jump over here, you'll see\nwhere I've got this kind of timeline.\n\n396\n00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.010\nAnd this is the timeline of my\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n397\n00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.980\nI've got right now, so\nthis is how the files are right now, and\n\n398\n00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:32.350\nthen I got 9 AM, 8 AM and\nthen it jumps back to yesterday.\n\n399\n00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.890\nWhy does it skip overnight?\n\n400\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.470\nWell nothing really changed.\n\n401\n00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.010\nThe odds are my laptop\nwent to sleep anyway.\n\n402\n00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.360\nActually I should mention that real quick.\n\n403\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.810\nSleep, does it run a backup\nwhen your laptop goes to sleep?\n\n404\n00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.260\nIt can.\nIt doesn't\n\n405\n00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260\nnecessarily do it by default though.\n\n406\n00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.900\nLet me get out of time\nmachine really quick.\n\n407\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.140\nCancel that.\n\n408\n00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.266\nGet out of time machine,\njump back to my VM here.\n\n409\n00:18:55.707 --> 00:18:58.068\nIf you go into your system preferences and\n\n410\n00:18:58.068 --> 00:19:02.310\ngo into energy saver there's\nan option inside of energy saver and.\n\n411\n00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.090\nShoot not in the VM,\nlet me do it in my actual laptop.\n\n412\n00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:08.850\nAnd if I go into the energy saver there's\nan option there called Power Nap.\n\n413\n00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:13.360\nAnd what Power Nap does is it says\nallow the laptop to wake up for\n\n414\n00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.860\ncertain events and if you notice enable\nPower Nap while plugged into a power\n\n415\n00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.560\nadaptor, while sleeping,\nyour Mac can back up using Time Machine.\n\n416\n00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.470\nSo even if my laptop goes to sleep,\nit'll continue to do backups.\n\n417\n00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.120\nSo if my laptop was asleep last night,\nwhy didn't it backup?\n\n418\n00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.040\nWhy didn't I see those in Time Machine\nwhen I went in to Time Machine?\n\n419\n00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.250\nWell, the reason is nothing changed.\n\n420\n00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:38.440\nIf nothing changed in that time then\nit's not gonna show me that time.\n\n421\n00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:43.210\nSo when I'm looking at the timeline,\nI'll see gaps in the timeline\n\n422\n00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:47.350\nlike from 8:17 AM to yesterday at 1:32 PM.\n\n423\n00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.780\nNothing changed so it's a big gap.\n\n424\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:54.150\nBut then before that, here's 1:32,\n12:39, and then it jumps down to 6:25.\n\n425\n00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.830\nWhat happened there?\n\n426\n00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:00.340\nWell, if you were watching the shows\nyesterday I came in around, I guess\n\n427\n00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:05.430\naround 7:30, I guess if I stop this backup\nand unplug the drive and then I did all my\n\n428\n00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.990\nshows and didn't plug in again until after\nlunch and so there's where that gap is.\n\n429\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:15.264\nBut as you keep going back you'll\nsee these are hourly backups,\n\n430\n00:20:15.264 --> 00:20:16.290\n12:15 AM, 1:17 AM, 2:18, 3:20.\n\n431\n00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.780\nThese are every hour.\n\n432\n00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:22.440\nBut as we continue to go back, you're\ngonna see where it starts jumping to days.\n\n433\n00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.760\nHere's March 21, March 20,\nMarch 19, March 18.\n\n434\n00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.890\nThat's one a day.\n\n435\n00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:32.160\nAnd as I continue to go further back,\nit's gonna go to one a week, right?\n\n436\n00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.111\nWell, I say that, notice there's March 7?\n\n437\n00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.720\nAnd then nothing.\n\n438\n00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.090\nWhat happened there?\n\n439\n00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:42.880\nWell, I didn't have this folder then.\n\n440\n00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.530\nWe hadn't planned for this show just yet.\n\n441\n00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.100\nHere we are it's March 30th, so\n\n442\n00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.640\nback before March 7th I didn't\nhave any show notes for aspca.\n\n443\n00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.190\nSo, I didn't have that folder.\n\n444\n00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.640\nI can't go back, beyond that.\n\n445\n00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.800\n>> So Don, is that just the back up for\nthat month, so\n\n446\n00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.500\nit just saves that very last one,\nand then moves onto the next one?\n\n447\n00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.770\nHow does it know which back up to use,\nI guess is the question?\n\n448\n00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.030\n>> So, it's actually putting all of these\nback ups kind of in the same place.\n\n449\n00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.740\nAnd so, it's up to me which\nback up it's going to use.\n\n450\n00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.970\nLet me pick a folder like my desktop\nthat I know has been there, right And so\n\n451\n00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.720\nwhen I go over here, I start to\nsee when it drops to those days.\n\n452\n00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.720\nAnd it's going back daily, daily, daily,\nand as I continue back even farther,\n\n453\n00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.770\nthat one doesn't go back.\n\n454\n00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.641\n>> I guess that's when\nyou [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n\n455\n00:21:25.641 --> 00:21:27.244\n>> I'm gonna go back far enough, but\n\n456\n00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:29.507\nif I go back further,\nif I could go back further,\n\n457\n00:21:29.507 --> 00:21:32.790\nthen I would start to see these\nweekly increments, and so on.\n\n458\n00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.860\nAnd so, what Daniel was asking was\nhow to know which backup to use.\n\n459\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.300\nWell, it's up to you.\n\n460\n00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.000\nWhen you come through here and\nyou pick a folder.\n\n461\n00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.880\nSo I wanna restore my desktop or the ACP\nnotes or whatever from a particular date.\n\n462\n00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.270\nI browse through here and I find the date.\n\n463\n00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:49.050\nAnd what you may find is that your\ndesktop is completely empty like mine.\n\n464\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.630\nBut you keep going back and then you\nfind there was a day somewhere in there.\n\n465\n00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.990\nWhere I had some kind\nof file on my desktop.\n\n466\n00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:55.730\nWhere'd it go?\n\n467\n00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.070\nThis is the hard part, you gotta find it.\n\n468\n00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.829\n>> Learn more.\n[LAUGH]\n\n469\n00:21:59.829 --> 00:22:00.611\n>> And somewhere here,\n\n470\n00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:02.050\nI just saw them up here really briefly.\n\n471\n00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.150\nThere were some files on my desktop.\n\n472\n00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.730\nAnd so maybe I need those files back.\n\n473\n00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.750\nI need to find where that\npoint in time was and\n\n474\n00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.810\nthen I can go and\nfind those files and restore them.\n\n475\n00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.460\n>> Am I crazy?\n\n476\n00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.810\n>> I saw it you are not crazy.\n\n477\n00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.925\n>> It's like Sasquatch right,\nwe've got witnesses.\n\n478\n00:22:15.925 --> 00:22:17.940\n[LAUGH] Anybody got a grainy photo?\n\n479\n00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.030\n>> A grainy photo yeah.\n\n480\n00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:20.460\n>> It's in here somewhere.\n\n481\n00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.120\n>> There it is.\n\n482\n00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.840\n>> [LAUGH] So I've got a core dump from\na web server that I was troubleshooting.\n\n483\n00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.090\nI don't need the core dump any more so\nI deleted it.\n\n484\n00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.730\nAnd then I've got a Sylvester Stallone\nmovie that Daniel and\n\n485\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.230\nI were talking about during\nthe show sitting right there.\n\n486\n00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.910\nAnd I deleted that too because,\nwell, I watched it.\n\n487\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.010\nSo what if I want that back?\n\n488\n00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.350\nWell here it is, it's in this backup,\nI can go and recover it.\n\n489\n00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:44.500\nSo I look at and I go,\nlet me jump back to March 22nd.\n\n490\n00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.040\nSo today's the 30th,\nthat's eight days ago.\n\n491\n00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.710\nI see that file.\n\n492\n00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.080\nI'm now looking at it from eight days ago.\n\n493\n00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.440\nIt knows what back-up I'm in\nbecause I found that date.\n\n494\n00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.580\nAnd if I just want to restore that file,\nI can choose it and I can hit restore.\n\n495\n00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.480\nOr I can drag and drop it and\nthrow it somewhere else.\n\n496\n00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:04.160\nYou can do a few different things if you\nCtrl click on it, see how you've got open.\n\n497\n00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.580\nI can just watch the movie right\nout of the back-up if I want.\n\n498\n00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.670\nI can restore it.\n\n499\n00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.090\nI can delete all the back-up.\n\n500\n00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.980\nSay, I want this to be gone,\ngone let me get rid of it.\n\n501\n00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.650\nYou can do whatever it is you want there.\n\n502\n00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:14.730\nYou can do a quick look and\n\n503\n00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.605\njust quickly watch how amazing\nan actor Sylvester Stallone is.\n\n504\n00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:19.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I'm gonna choose it and\n\n505\n00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.730\njust hit Restore.\n\n506\n00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.320\nAnd so it's gonna restore it and\nsee what it's doing?\n\n507\n00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.610\nSee how I'm warping forward in time?\n\n508\n00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:25.690\nAnd now I'm looking at now.\n\n509\n00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:29.210\nAnd when I look at now, in just a moment,\n\n510\n00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.240\nthat movie's gonna appear right back in\nmy desktop coming off of my USB drive.\n\n511\n00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.180\nNow If you restore a lot of data,\nit takes a long time to bring it back.\n\n512\n00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.532\nIt's copying over USB,\nin my case USB 3.0, so it should be-\n\n513\n00:23:39.532 --> 00:23:40.593\n>> Relatively quickly.\n\n514\n00:23:40.593 --> 00:23:43.774\n>> Fairly quick, but, I've got my\nlittle spinning circle of doom there,\n\n515\n00:23:43.774 --> 00:23:44.831\nthe pinwheel of death.\n\n516\n00:23:44.831 --> 00:23:46.915\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'll just let that pinwheel away,\n\n517\n00:23:46.915 --> 00:23:48.790\nbut now it's going to restore that data.\n\n518\n00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:51.920\nNow, for single file recovery,\nthat was pretty easy.\n\n519\n00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.970\nWhat if I had my entire system?\n\n520\n00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.130\nWell, that's a different story.\n\n521\n00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.373\nNow you've got to boot to recovery.\n\n522\n00:23:57.373 --> 00:23:59.962\nWhen you boot to recovery, you've got\nthat option, restore from time machine.\n\n523\n00:23:59.962 --> 00:24:01.309\nYou can bring it right back.\n\n524\n00:24:01.309 --> 00:24:02.911\nAnd you'll be in business, okay.\n\n525\n00:24:02.911 --> 00:24:05.725\nSo that's gonna recover and\nthen we see it's copying now,\n\n526\n00:24:05.725 --> 00:24:07.480\nit's kinda bringing it right back.\n\n527\n00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.740\nAnd I can see my little icon so\n\n528\n00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:13.740\nin a moment we're going to have what I was\njust shocked was passed over by an Oscar.\n\n529\n00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.280\n>> The cinematic masterpiece.\n\n530\n00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.910\n>> Absolutely.\n>> That is this Stallone film.\n\n531\n00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.680\n>> We don't have great\ntaste here at ITProTV but\n\n532\n00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.680\nwe do know how to use Time Machine.\n\n533\n00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.695\n[LAUGH] All right, let me jump back,\n\n534\n00:24:21.695 --> 00:24:25.500\nis there's something else I wanna show\nyou guys as as a support professional.\n\n535\n00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.460\nLet's say you got laptops, so\nyou take somebody's laptop and\n\n536\n00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.180\nyou get them set up for Time Machine.\n\n537\n00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.700\nEverything's configured properly,\nyou know it's right.\n\n538\n00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.090\nI've got this machine set up for\nTime Machine.\n\n539\n00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:40.850\nThere's a few things we might want to\ntweak to make Time Machine work better or\n\n540\n00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.590\nworse for us.\n\n541\n00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.950\nAnd let me explain.\n\n542\n00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.760\nFirst off, it's kind of hard to\nget into Time Machine sometimes.\n\n543\n00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.170\nIf I'm browsing my hard drive and\n\n544\n00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:50.950\nI'm looking at data,\nhow do I know if a backup is run?\n\n545\n00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.830\nHow do I enter into Time Machine\nreally easily if I want to go and\n\n546\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.230\nlook at a previous version of this folder.\n\n547\n00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.820\nWell we don't have a whole\nlot of menu options and\n\n548\n00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.570\nstuff that makes it obvious\nhow to get into Time Machine.\n\n549\n00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:06.130\nSo one feature I really like to do\nis to turn on the menu bar item\n\n550\n00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:07.450\nfor Time Machine.\n\n551\n00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:11.810\nIf I go into System Preferences and go\ninto the Time Machine system preference,\n\n552\n00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:16.170\nthere's a little check box in here that\nsays Show Time Machine in menu bar.\n\n553\n00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.590\nAnd if you check that you get a nice\nlittle Time Machine icon up here and\n\n554\n00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:23.360\nI always turn this on because\nyou can quickly click on it and\n\n555\n00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.380\nit'll tell you what it's doing.\n\n556\n00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.240\nSee how mines finishing it's back up?\n\n557\n00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:26.770\nRight?\n\n558\n00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.000\nSo, I know that that's what it's doing.\n\n559\n00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.860\nAnd now, I can see the latest back up,\nso I know that I've got a good back up.\n\n560\n00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.950\nHow do I know it backed up last night?\n\n561\n00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.710\nI can click on this and I can quickly\nsee whether or not it backed up, so\n\n562\n00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:37.850\na great way to see that.\n\n563\n00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:42.950\nBut you can also force it to start backing\nup now, and you can Enter Time Machine.\n\n564\n00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:46.390\nMakes it really, quick, and\neasy to jump right into Time Machine and\n\n565\n00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.890\nstart restoring that data,\nand it just makes it simple.\n\n566\n00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.330\nSo I almost always turn\non that little menu item.\n\n567\n00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.780\nThat's one that really helps.\n\n568\n00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:57.660\nAlright, now the other thing is\non a laptop, if you know people\n\n569\n00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.090\nare gonna be traveling and they're not\ngonna take their backup drive with them.\n\n570\n00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.500\nBecause if their laptop gets stolen\ntheir backup drive gets stolen,\n\n571\n00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.510\nthey just lost all their data.\n\n572\n00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.740\nSo when you travel you probably\nleave your backup drive at home, or\n\n573\n00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.040\nleave it at the office.\n\n574\n00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.560\nSo when you're traveling,\nTime Machine doesn't run, does it?\n\n575\n00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.400\nActually, it does,\nTime Machine still runs.\n\n576\n00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.020\nWhat happens is your\nlaptop will start to make\n\n577\n00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.820\na temporary Time Machine backup\nright on your own hard drive.\n\n578\n00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.570\nIt's hidden from you, you don't see it,\nbut it is there, so when your\n\n579\n00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:27.010\nlaptop is not plugged in, it will actually\ncontinue to take time machine backups.\n\n580\n00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.280\nNow that's a double-edged sword.\n\n581\n00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.140\nOn a positive side,\n\n582\n00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.590\nyou're continuing to take backups\nyou can restore deleted files.\n\n583\n00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.810\nYou can't restore your system,\nit's stored on the same hard drive,\n\n584\n00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.670\nthat's not gonna work, but\nyou can restore deleted files.\n\n585\n00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.950\nOn a negative side,\nit's taking up hard drive space.\n\n586\n00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.020\nSo let's say you got a Macbook Pro and\n\n587\n00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.690\nto save money you just did\nthe 128GB SSD storage option.\n\n588\n00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.090\nYou don't have a ton of storage.\n\n589\n00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.880\nThat local Time Machine backup\nreally starts to eat up that space.\n\n590\n00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.270\nSo you've gotta be careful there too,\nyou can run out of hard drive space.\n\n591\n00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:56.951\n>> Yeah I've seen Ronnie actually have\neight megs of space left on his computer,\n\n592\n00:26:56.951 --> 00:26:59.363\nso [LAUGH] that would be\na small Time Machine backup.\n\n593\n00:26:59.363 --> 00:27:00.182\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n594\n00:27:00.182 --> 00:27:03.452\nAnd you can tell if it's configured,\nif you go into your Volumes folder,\n\n595\n00:27:03.452 --> 00:27:04.682\nit's hidden, in the GUI.\n\n596\n00:27:04.682 --> 00:27:07.902\nBut in the terminal, if you go into\nthe Volumes folder and take a look,\n\n597\n00:27:07.902 --> 00:27:11.680\nyou'll probably see a volume called,\nwell, actually, that's Time Machine.\n\n598\n00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.220\nShoot, actually that's not\nthe one that I wanted to see.\n\n599\n00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.040\nWe'll see if it's super hidden.\n\n600\n00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.020\nIt's just not there yet.\n\n601\n00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.940\nWell, sometimes the backup has to run\na few times before it shows up, but\n\n602\n00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:23.710\nwhat you'll see is a folder in\nhere called Mobile Backups.\n\n603\n00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.900\nI know why mine's not showing up, is I've\ngot my Time Machine drive hooked up.\n\n604\n00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.250\nIt's right there, right?\n\n605\n00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.410\nSo when it runs the Time Machine backup,\nit's got it, it can back up there,\n\n606\n00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.090\nit doesn't need to do the mobile backup.\n\n607\n00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.210\nBut I bet if I unmount that, so\nI'm gonna take that Time Machine drive and\n\n608\n00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:36.960\nI'll just eject it.\n\n609\n00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.180\nFailed to eject cuz it's currently in use.\n\n610\n00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:41.770\nWho's using it?\n\n611\n00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:46.490\nI could Force Eject it, but\nI try not to do that if I can avoid it.\n\n612\n00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.848\nNot exactly sure who's using that.\n\n613\n00:27:51.598 --> 00:27:52.598\nPlease eject this time.\n\n614\n00:27:52.598 --> 00:27:57.457\n[LAUGH] And it's not even gonna give\nme the Force Eject option because\n\n615\n00:27:57.457 --> 00:28:01.220\nit does think that it's truly in use,\nshoot.\n\n616\n00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.320\nWell, if I were to eject it and\nthe drive's not available,\n\n617\n00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.250\nthere we go, Force Eject.\n\n618\n00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.080\nPerfect, get rid of that guy.\n\n619\n00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:06.960\nPerfect.\n\n620\n00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.290\nAll right, now if I try and run a Time\nMachine backup, the drive's not there, so\n\n621\n00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:11.910\nit's not gonna back up, right?\n\n622\n00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:16.000\nWell, it'll actually continue to do those\nbackups, and so if I say backup now, it's\n\n623\n00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.930\ngonna try and run and well, it's gonna\ncomplain about just not being available.\n\n624\n00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.520\nI interrupted it.\n\n625\n00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.500\nBut what it'll do is it'll make\na folder here called Mobile Backups.\n\n626\n00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.950\nAnd that's the temporary Time Machine.\n\n627\n00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.730\nThe next time you plug in your Time\nMachine drive, it'll copy that stuff over.\n\n628\n00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:31.278\nBut until then it's storing it right here,\nand so it's easy to spot cuz you'll have\n\n629\n00:28:31.278 --> 00:28:33.890\nthat Mobile Backups folder\nwhich I'm now missing.\n\n630\n00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:36.010\nNow you can turn that functionality on or\n\n631\n00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:38.420\noff, it's up to you whether\nyou want that to be there.\n\n632\n00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.540\nThe command is you have to do a sudo cuz\nyou gotta be an administrator to do it.\n\n633\n00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.130\nSo I'm gonna say sudo tmutil,\nthis is the Time Machine utility,\n\n634\n00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.650\nthe command line interface for\nTime Machine.\n\n635\n00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:52.150\nI'll say tmutil enablelocal,\n\n636\n00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:55.770\nthat's what turns on the ability\nto do the local Time Machine.\n\n637\n00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:59.270\nSo that's gonna turn it on, doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'm gonna use it, but\n\n638\n00:28:59.270 --> 00:28:59.980\nit'll turn it on.\n\n639\n00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.250\nAnd in fact, assuming that works,\nlet's see if it'll do a backup for me.\n\n640\n00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.900\nAnd that's still gonna complain, but\nthat'll turn that functionality on so\n\n641\n00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.870\nit can backup to that\nMobile Backups folder.\n\n642\n00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:14.868\nAnd then the other one is tmutil,\nactually I still need to do a sudo\n\n643\n00:29:14.868 --> 00:29:19.860\ntmutil disable local.\n\n644\n00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.970\nSo if you're like Ronnie and\nyou're running out of hard drive space and\n\n645\n00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:24.470\nyou wanna turn that off, you can turn\nit off and now you won't have it.\n\n646\n00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.896\nAnd I know why this one's not doing it,\n\n647\n00:29:25.896 --> 00:29:29.710\nI'm in a VMware virtual machine,\nit thinks it's a desktop.\n\n648\n00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.260\nIt doesn't know it's a laptop.\n\n649\n00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.770\nThat's why you might have noticed,\nthe power nap option wasn't here,\n\n650\n00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:36.980\nbecause again, it didn't think it was\na laptop, it thought it was a desktop.\n\n651\n00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.290\nYou don't need power nap there.\n\n652\n00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:39.860\nSo, that's why it's not showing up.\n\n653\n00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.250\nLaptops are the ones that need this,\nthe mobile backup.\n\n654\n00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.030\nSo, on my laptop, I could turn it on, but\nin this virtual machine it's not there,\n\n655\n00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.360\nso that's why it's not showing up.\n\n656\n00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.870\nBut, tmutil enablelocal or\ndisablelocal, turn it on or off.\n\n657\n00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.470\nAnd that'll appear so you can\ncontinue to do Time Machine backups,\n\n658\n00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.670\neven when the drive is not plugged in.\n\n659\n00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.660\n>> Now Don, we got a quick\nquestion from our chatroom there,\n\n660\n00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.520\nasking if you get\ninfected with a virus and\n\n661\n00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.890\nyou wanna go back and use Time Machine\nas a backup, is that now infected?\n\n662\n00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:07.110\nDo viruses infect that?\n\n663\n00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:11.130\nOr maybe I've taken a few backups\nwith that virus on my system?\n\n664\n00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.288\nWhat do I do in that scenario?\n\n665\n00:30:12.288 --> 00:30:15.437\n>> All right, so\nif your machine gets infected,\n\n666\n00:30:15.437 --> 00:30:18.910\nif a Time Machine backup\nruns after the infection,\n\n667\n00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:23.980\nthose backups are infected, but\nyour previous backups are not.\n\n668\n00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.210\nAnd so the previous back-ups\ndon't have the virus in them.\n\n669\n00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:30.640\nAnd if you were to boot to recovery and\nrestore the Time Machine backup,\n\n670\n00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.530\nformat your hard drive, restore the Time\nMachine backup, the virus would be gone.\n\n671\n00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:34.460\nYou'd be rolled back.\n\n672\n00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.360\nNow, however you got that virus is\na vulnerability in the system and\n\n673\n00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.700\nthe vulnerability is still there so\nyou can always get re-infected, but\n\n674\n00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.190\nthe virus itself is gone.\n\n675\n00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:47.630\nLet's say the virus copies itself\nall over the Time Machine backup.\n\n676\n00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:48.680\nIf that happens,\n\n677\n00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:52.980\nyou still have to execute the virus in\norder to cause that infection to occur.\n\n678\n00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.410\nSo when you restore your backup,\n\n679\n00:30:55.410 --> 00:31:01.030\nwell you'd have to trigger that\nvirus to run somehow to reinfect.\n\n680\n00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.980\nSo when you restore,\nyou're actually clean, you would need to\n\n681\n00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.800\nthen patch the vulnerability to make sure\nyou didn't get that virus back again.\n\n682\n00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.420\nBut you would actually be clean.\n\n683\n00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.630\nTime Machine can roll you back and\n\n684\n00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:13.370\nyou can roll back your whole system\nif you just boot your recovery.\n\n685\n00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:14.690\n>> Awesome stuff,\n\n686\n00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:18.560\nwell viruses are typically bound\nwhen they, in the Apple world.\n\n687\n00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.990\nSo it shouldn't be too much of a problem,\nright?\n\n688\n00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:24.600\n>> Yeah, and one other little secret,\nlet me mention this one.\n\n689\n00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.450\nIf you have a virus, you wanna make sure\nthat you completely cleanse your hard\n\n690\n00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:33.880\ndrive before you jump back in and\nstart restoring and all of that.\n\n691\n00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.640\nSo when we boot to recovery, technically\nyou're booting from recovery from your\n\n692\n00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.310\ninternal hard drive, so\nyou might not wanna do that.\n\n693\n00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:43.180\nRemember that most Macs do support\nInternet recovery these days.\n\n694\n00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.050\nSo when you boot, instead of doing Cmd+R\nwhich boots off your local recovery,\n\n695\n00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:48.451\nyou can do Cmd+Option+R.\n\n696\n00:31:48.451 --> 00:31:51.964\nAnd that will make it boot Internet\nrecovery, where it will download\n\n697\n00:31:51.964 --> 00:31:55.903\nthe recovery partition from Apple so\nthat you know it's clean and clear, and\n\n698\n00:31:55.903 --> 00:31:58.352\nthen you can restore\nyour Time Machine backup.\n\n699\n00:31:58.352 --> 00:32:01.689\nThe other thing is, Apple doesn't\nreally promote this a whole lot, but\n\n700\n00:32:01.689 --> 00:32:04.807\nyour Time Machine drive When you\nformat it and turn on Time Machine,\n\n701\n00:32:04.807 --> 00:32:08.630\nit actually puts a recovery partition\non the Time Machine drive too.\n\n702\n00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.890\nSo you could boot off of your Time Machine\ndrive, and restore it, and so you know\n\n703\n00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:16.480\nyou've got a good, clean recovery there,\nversus the one that's in your system.\n\n704\n00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.040\nSo definitely be aware of those.\n\n705\n00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.978\nAnd then also, don't be afraid to\nbrowse into the Time Machine drive.\n\n706\n00:32:20.978 --> 00:32:22.038\nLet me show you guys.\n\n707\n00:32:22.038 --> 00:32:24.460\nIf I browse into my\nTime Machine hard drive,\n\n708\n00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:28.979\nthere's a folder called Backups.backupdb,\nso this is my backup database, and\n\n709\n00:32:28.979 --> 00:32:32.907\nif I browse in there, DPLAPTOP-OSX,\nright, that's my laptop, and\n\n710\n00:32:32.907 --> 00:32:36.000\nwhen I browse into there,\nI see a bunch of dates.\n\n711\n00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.690\nThese are the backups, March 7,\nMarch 8, March 9, and so on.\n\n712\n00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:43.450\nAnd then it goes down to, here's March 29,\nand see how I've got a ton of backups?\n\n713\n00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:45.350\nThose are the hourly backups,\nthey're all right here.\n\n714\n00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.680\nAnd they're just folders,\nyou can browse right into them.\n\n715\n00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:51.710\nAnd here's my Macintosh HD, and\nI can see what's changed, right, so\n\n716\n00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:57.090\nI can go into Users, donpezet, Desktop,\nand see what's changed, right?\n\n717\n00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:00.680\nAnd, sorry, I was trying to go into\nDesktop, which is apparently empty.\n\n718\n00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.550\nSo my desktop was blank that day.\n\n719\n00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:03.328\nI don't see anything.\n\n720\n00:33:03.328 --> 00:33:06.216\nI should have paid attention to what\nday this data claim was stored on.\n\n721\n00:33:06.216 --> 00:33:07.895\nBut, yeah, I can't get to that now.\n\n722\n00:33:07.895 --> 00:33:09.815\nBut you can browse it and\nyou can see what changed.\n\n723\n00:33:09.815 --> 00:33:11.866\nIf you go all the way back\nto your original one,\n\n724\n00:33:11.866 --> 00:33:14.140\nthis one should be a full\nbackup to your hard drive.\n\n725\n00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.180\nIt should be everything.\n\n726\n00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.510\nSo if you browse in,\nyou'll see a lot of stuff in there and\n\n727\n00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:20.600\nbe able to pull that data out.\n\n728\n00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.960\nIf you just want an individual file,\nyou might wanna browse it that way and\n\n729\n00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.480\nfind it and get it.\n\n730\n00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.420\nIf you choose to encrypt it, that's why\nit's so important to encrypt it, right?\n\n731\n00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.500\nThis is protected.\n\n732\n00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.050\nIf not, anybody could grab this drive and\nplug it in,\n\n733\n00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:34.240\nand they can just browse right\nthrough my hard drive contents.\n\n734\n00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.600\nThey don't even have to have\na username and password.\n\n735\n00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.588\nThat's the danger with\nthe Time Machine backups.\n\n736\n00:33:37.588 --> 00:33:39.869\n>> Get your Steam login information,\nthat'll be fun.\n\n737\n00:33:39.869 --> 00:33:41.171\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's, you know,\n\n738\n00:33:41.171 --> 00:33:42.148\nmission critical information.\n\n739\n00:33:42.148 --> 00:33:43.108\n>> That's very much setup.\n\n740\n00:33:43.108 --> 00:33:46.660\n[LAUGH] Well, Don,\nyou've done a great job of stopping by and\n\n741\n00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.420\nletting us learn how Time Machine works.\n\n742\n00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.468\nSuper easy,\nyou'd be a great propaganda man for them.\n\n743\n00:33:51.468 --> 00:33:52.651\nSo-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n744\n00:33:52.651 --> 00:33:53.572\n>> I'll reference if you\n\n745\n00:33:53.572 --> 00:33:54.518\nneed it, so [LAUGH].\n\n746\n00:33:54.518 --> 00:33:57.190\nWell, you know, Dan, you and\nI, we work with Windows a lot.\n\n747\n00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:58.710\n>> We do.\n>> And we work with Linux a lot,\n\n748\n00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:00.890\nyou know how hard it is to get\nthose backups up and running.\n\n749\n00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:02.080\nThis really is super easy.\n\n750\n00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.730\n>> Yeah, this is by far the easiest\nbackup system I've ever had to deal with.\n\n751\n00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.260\nAnd like Don said,\n\n752\n00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:12.390\nI have to overcome my own inertia\n[LAUGH] to actually do backups.\n\n753\n00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:15.360\nIf you make it as easy as humanly\npossible, well then I'm probably,\n\n754\n00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.230\nI'm more likely to do it than not.\n\n755\n00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:21.530\nAnd because data is important, we wanna\nmake sure that it is safe and secure.\n\n756\n00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.000\nTime Machine does that for us.\n\n757\n00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.272\nDon, thanks again for stopping by and\nexplaining how to use Time Machine for\n\n758\n00:34:26.272 --> 00:34:28.900\nus and all the cool,\nlittle ways in which we can use it.\n\n759\n00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.340\nNot just to take a backup but\nmore advance features are awesome as well.\n\n760\n00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.500\nAnd thank you, guys, for\nstopping by and joining us.\n\n761\n00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.010\nHopefully you guys got a lot\nof information out of this and\n\n762\n00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:40.216\nsomething you can take\ninto your everyday lives.\n\n763\n00:34:40.216 --> 00:34:45.188\nStart performing backups, keep that data\nsafe, and go pass an exam, if you can.\n\n764\n00:34:45.188 --> 00:34:48.362\nThat being said, we're gonna sign off,\nwe're ITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n765\n00:34:48.362 --> 00:34:49.008\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n766\n00:34:49.008 --> 00:34:49.888\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n767\n00:34:49.888 --> 00:34:52.308\n>>

another\nexciting of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.370\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.380\nAnd in today's episode we're continuing\non with our Apple certified support\n\n6\n00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.620\nprofessional series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.750\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto help us out with that very endeavor,\n\n8\n00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.950\nmy good friend Mr Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.360\nDon, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n10\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.320\n>> Thanks for having me back Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.240\nReady to jump right back into\nthe support professional role.\n\n12\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.750\nAnd in this episode we're\ngoing to look at applications.\n\n13\n00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.420\nAnd this is a pretty important thing\nbecause when you give somebody a brand new\n\n14\n00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.566\nMac, be it a laptop, desktop, whatever,\nit doesn't have a whole heck of a lot.\n\n15\n00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.760\nI shouldn't say that cuz it actually does\nhave a whole lot of good stuff on there.\n\n16\n00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.900\nSo you've got the Safari web\nbrowser which is usable.\n\n17\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.650\nYou've got-\n>> GarageBand.\n\n18\n00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.890\n>> You've got GarageBand.\n\n19\n00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.336\nMaybe you have that whole iLife suite, I\ndon't think you can call it iLife anymore.\n\n20\n00:00:57.336 --> 00:00:59.888\nBut you might have pages and numbers and\n\n21\n00:00:59.888 --> 00:01:04.780\nall the other kind of business\nproductivity applications on there.\n\n22\n00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.220\nAnd that stuff's really good,\nyou can use it.\n\n23\n00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.730\nBut in an enterprise environment\nthe odds are you're gonna have a line of\n\n24\n00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.790\nbusiness applications.\n\n25\n00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.520\nApplications that you\nneed to do your work.\n\n26\n00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.080\nAnd the odds are they're not gonna be\nprepackaged on that Mac when you buy it.\n\n27\n00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.010\nSo, we have to install things.\n\n28\n00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.920\nWe have to add software, and I know I\ndo this and it could be simple things.\n\n29\n00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.630\nIt could be an alternate web browser.\n\n30\n00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.620\nI like Google Chrome so\n\n31\n00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.640\nI've got to install Google Chrome\non my system to be able to use it.\n\n32\n00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.740\nI might prefer Safari or\nVivaldi or Firefox or whatever, so\n\n33\n00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.050\nyou might have to install that\nsoftware to get it in place.\n\n34\n00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.160\nI might like Microsoft Office\nbetter than the suite from Apple.\n\n35\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.570\nAnd so I go ahead and\ninstall Microsoft Word and Excel.\n\n36\n00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.250\nI've gotta put those on there, right.\n\n37\n00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.840\nAnd in an enterprise environment,\nyou may likely have to do that for\n\n38\n00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.690\nyour clients ahead of time, or\nyour customers, ahead of time.\n\n39\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.830\nNow, back in\nthe Mac Management Basics series,\n\n40\n00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.690\nif you guys watched that series, I showed\nyou guys how to make OS10 installation\n\n41\n00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.720\nimages that already had applications baked\ninto them and that's really good stuff.\n\n42\n00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.730\nIf you haven't seen that,\ndefinitely jump back for those.\n\n43\n00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.700\nIf you don't feel like jumping backwards,\nwhen we get to the ACTC shows we'll cover\n\n44\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.690\nit again on the server shows so\nyou'll get a chance to see it there.\n\n45\n00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.210\nBut I just want to mention that right here\ncuz that's one of the easiest way to do it\n\n46\n00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.000\nis you can build the installation image\nthat already has all the apps on there.\n\n47\n00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.630\nBut let's say you don't\nwant to go through that.\n\n48\n00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.680\nYou just want to install\napps right here on the Mac.\n\n49\n00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.850\nWell, there's two main ways that we\ncan get apps installed on your Mac.\n\n50\n00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.030\nThere's using the App Store which is the\nway that Apple would prefer we do it and\n\n51\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.270\nthen there's what's called sideloading\nwhere we manually install them.\n\n52\n00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.777\nNow, before there was an App Store\nthere was only sideloading and\n\n53\n00:02:41.777 --> 00:02:43.350\nthey didn't call it\nside loading back then.\n\n54\n00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.400\nBack then it was just\ncalled installing an app.\n\n55\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.820\nSo let's talk about that one first.\n\n56\n00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.050\nIf I want to install and app that's\nsideloaded, what the heck does that mean?\n\n57\n00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.510\nIt means you to the vendor's web site,\nyou download their software, and\n\n58\n00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.080\nyou install it.\n\n59\n00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.630\nYou do it by hand.\n\n60\n00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.420\nAnd if an update comes out for that\nprogram, you need to go and do the update.\n\n61\n00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.880\nAnd you do it by hand.\n\n62\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.000\nAnd that's just how it runs.\n\n63\n00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.420\nIt's all in between you and\nthe vendor of that software.\n\n64\n00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.610\nApple really doesn't get\nin the mix on that, okay.\n\n65\n00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.180\nSo you're dealing\ndirectly with the vendor.\n\n66\n00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.750\nAnd up until a few years ago, that was\nthe way to install apps on your Mac.\n\n67\n00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.980\nAnd so that was just called installing\nan app, but now it's called sideloading.\n\n68\n00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.030\nWhat is that?\n\n69\n00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.830\nIt's like we're gonna do this on the side,\nright.\n\n70\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.460\n>> Yeah, it's like a back alley deal.\n\n71\n00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.468\nThat's what it seems like.\n\n72\n00:03:25.468 --> 00:03:26.600\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n73\n00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.230\nAnd that's kind of what it is.\n\n74\n00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.970\nIs Apple said, you know what,\nthere's a better way to do this.\n\n75\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.490\nThere's a better way than making you have\nto update your own software, making you\n\n76\n00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.992\nhave to go out and find it, making you\nensure the software is trustworthy.\n\n77\n00:03:37.992 --> 00:03:40.360\nCuz do how you gonna\nknow it's trustworthy?\n\n78\n00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.570\nWhen you go and down load that software,\nit could be infected with malware.\n\n79\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.780\nYou don't know, right.\n\n80\n00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.560\nAnd there's been some\nreal examples of that.\n\n81\n00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.290\nWe had that key ranger malware that was\na ransom ware that was pushing out through\n\n82\n00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.240\nthe transmission bit torrent client.\n\n83\n00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.725\nSo you'd go to the transmission website,\nthe actual vendor,\n\n84\n00:03:56.725 --> 00:03:59.060\nyou'd download the software\nright from them, and\n\n85\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.600\nit had the ransom ware installed in\nit right when you downloaded it.\n\n86\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.630\nAnd how would you know that it was there?\n\n87\n00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.530\nWell, thousands of people didn't and\n\n88\n00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.380\nthey got their systems encrypted\nbased on that lack of knowledge.\n\n89\n00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.010\nSo what Apple said is, hey,\nlet's set up a central repository.\n\n90\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.080\nLet's create a place right here\non Apple's own servers where\n\n91\n00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.100\ndevelopers can give us their software,\nwe'll scan it, make sure it's clean,\n\n92\n00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.570\nmake sure it's trustworthy, and then give\nthe users a way to download it easily.\n\n93\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.210\nWe don't have to go to\ngo different websites,\n\n94\n00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.420\nwe don't have to verify identities, we\ndon't have to make sure that yes this is\n\n95\n00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.770\nthe actual vendor's website and not some\nphishing site that just looks like it.\n\n96\n00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.840\nI'm on the actual site,\nI'm getting the intact software.\n\n97\n00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.770\nAnd so\nwe can do that in the Apple App Store.\n\n98\n00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.600\nAnd Apple is so proud of this App Store\nthat it is now the default primary way for\n\n99\n00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.950\ninstalling applications.\n\n100\n00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.380\nAnd anything else is on the side,\nit's side-loading.\n\n101\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.190\nIt's up to you, you're bypassing all\nof our protections to install software.\n\n102\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.494\nThe only way you were able to do it for\nthe last 20 years,\n\n103\n00:04:58.494 --> 00:04:59.890\nthat's now the side way, right.\n\n104\n00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.120\nSo that's where we get the terminology.\n\n105\n00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.776\n>> Deal with those shady\ncharacters out there, right.\n\n106\n00:05:02.776 --> 00:05:03.370\n[LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.116\n>> Yeah, well you-\n>> It could be.\n\n108\n00:05:04.116 --> 00:05:06.520\n>> You don't know.\nThat website could've been hacked and\n\n109\n00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.430\ntaken over, the software could\nbe malicious, you don't know.\n\n110\n00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.480\nNow you can scan it, you can check\nit yourself, there's ways to see.\n\n111\n00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.830\nBut if you use the Apple App Store,\nthey've already done it.\n\n112\n00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.240\nWe don't have to worry about it,\nit's trustworthy.\n\n113\n00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.180\nWell, as trustworthy as anything is\nthese days, but that's the idea.\n\n114\n00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.760\nNow, what's the problem\nwith the App Store?\n\n115\n00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.610\nWell it can't all be rainbows and\nsunshine and unicorns.\n\n116\n00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.510\nThe biggest problem with the App Store\nis that Apple charges money for\n\n117\n00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.990\npeople to have apps in it.\n\n118\n00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.990\nAnd so if somebody has free software,\nthey're kinda penalize for\n\n119\n00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.920\nputting it in the App Stores.\n\n120\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.730\nSo a lot of free software doesn't go\nin to the App Store based on that.\n\n121\n00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.335\nIf it's pay software, Apple takes,\nit's something like 30% or 40%,\n\n122\n00:05:46.335 --> 00:05:48.670\nit's a good chunk of the money.\n\n123\n00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.250\nSo people who sell their programs,\nthey're kind of disincentivized.\n\n124\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.115\nIs that even a word?\n\n125\n00:05:55.115 --> 00:05:56.550\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's almost like\n\n126\n00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.400\nthey're encouraged not to put their\napp in there because they can make 30%\n\n127\n00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.000\nmore if they just sell\nit on their own website.\n\n128\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.960\nSo there's plenty of programs out there,\nlike if I want Microsoft Office.\n\n129\n00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.160\nSo I'll take this machine here.\n\n130\n00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.350\nI want to install Microsoft Office on\nthis machine, so I fire up my App Store.\n\n131\n00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.550\nI'm just going to jump into the App Store.\n\n132\n00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.080\nAnd I'm going to do a search.\n\n133\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.020\nI want Microsoft Word, okay.\n\n134\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.460\nSo I'm going to do a quick search here for\nMicrosoft Word, and\n\n135\n00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.590\nwhen I search I look in the App Store and\nhere's Microsoft Word, right.\n\n136\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.220\nNot really, if you look this is\nDocument Writer, Word Writer, Quick Word,\n\n137\n00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.300\nWord Time.\n\n138\n00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.330\nThese are other people's programs.\n\n139\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.260\nThese are not Microsoft's.\n\n140\n00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.390\nEven these ones that look like the\nlegitimate icon, if you click on those and\n\n141\n00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.669\nlook at the company, right.\n\n142\n00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:42.600\nSo I can see over here this\nis productivity software, and\n\n143\n00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.450\nthe seller is Longquan Zhu,\nthat's not Microsoft.\n\n144\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.430\n>> That's not Microsoft.\n\n145\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.585\n>> Yeah, that's not how you\nspell Bill Gates or whatever.\n\n146\n00:06:49.585 --> 00:06:51.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Zhulq Incorporated,\n\n147\n00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.830\nso that's not Microsoft, right.\n\n148\n00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.120\nMicrosoft says, hey, we want 100% of\nthe money when we sell our software.\n\n149\n00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.810\nSo if you want Microsoft Office,\nyou gotta come to our website and\n\n150\n00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.840\nyou gotta buy it there.\n\n151\n00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.960\nAll right, you gotta sign up for\nOffice 365, and you'll get it.\n\n152\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.548\nAnd that's fine,\nthat's how they choose to do it.\n\n153\n00:07:05.548 --> 00:07:09.100\nBut that's sideloading If we\nget an app from the App Store,\n\n154\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.625\nyeah it might be from Longquan Zhu, right,\n\n155\n00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:15.900\nwho I've never heard of prior to this very\nmoment I've never heard of that gentleman.\n\n156\n00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.730\nMay be very, very knowledgeable, very,\nvery trustworthy, I've never heard of him.\n\n157\n00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.730\nCould be very, very shady.\n\n158\n00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.660\nI don't know.\n\n159\n00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.680\nAnd I don't have to,\ncuz Apple's already verified it.\n\n160\n00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.220\nApple's already checked this offer to make\nsure that's is safe and that it's okay.\n\n161\n00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.540\nAnd verify that developer.\n\n162\n00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.870\nAnd so Apple says, no, he's a good guy.\n\n163\n00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.590\nYou can trust Longquan Zhu, he's okay,\nuse his software if you want it.\n\n164\n00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.990\nNow his software's ten dollars, and so\nI can buy it and install it right here.\n\n165\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.650\nAnd we do get little reviews and\n\n166\n00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.830\nthings where you can see if\nother people think it's okay.\n\n167\n00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.386\nAnd if I look in here, this one,\n\n168\n00:07:46.386 --> 00:07:49.467\npredominantly we got nine\npositive ratings, two negatives.\n\n169\n00:07:49.467 --> 00:07:52.708\nBut you can get an idea of whether that\nsoftware is good, people seem to like it.\n\n170\n00:07:52.708 --> 00:07:54.666\nAnd that's the advantage of the App Store.\n\n171\n00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:57.786\nIf I just go to somebody's website,\nI don't have ratings.\n\n172\n00:07:57.786 --> 00:07:59.152\nAt least ratings that you can trust.\n\n173\n00:07:59.152 --> 00:08:02.250\nYou know they can put their\nown ratings up there.\n\n174\n00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.853\nYou just don't have that verification.\n\n175\n00:08:03.853 --> 00:08:06.160\nYou don't have that trust.\n\n176\n00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.980\nThat's what's missing.\n\n177\n00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.730\nWhen we go to the App Store\nyou can find an App and\n\n178\n00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.520\nyou can install it and off you go.\n\n179\n00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.630\nIf it's free you can just install it and\nthat's it.\n\n180\n00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:20.010\nYou do need to sign up for an Apple ID\ngot to have an Apple ID for this to work.\n\n181\n00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.590\nEven the free apps require\nan Apple ID to connect.\n\n182\n00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.680\nAnd once you buy something or even a free\none it gets added to your account.\n\n183\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.780\nSo you can jump under\nPurchase right here and\n\n184\n00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.570\nyou can see the apps that you have\npurchased and get those installed.\n\n185\n00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.080\nAnd so\nyou'll see I've installed a few things.\n\n186\n00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.470\nSome of these are free and\nsome ive paid for So the OS 10 server app.\n\n187\n00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.780\nThat's Apple's own server app, right?\n\n188\n00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.650\nWell, they sell it through the App Store.\n\n189\n00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.750\nAnd so I can go, and\nyou can buy it, it's $20.\n\n190\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.040\nYou buy it and now you can install\nit on as many machines as you need.\n\n191\n00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.680\nMost of them have that family sharing\nthey limit to five machines so\n\n192\n00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.310\nI shouldn't say as many as you want,\nbut you can install it on your machine.\n\n193\n00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.510\nAnd now you've got an access,\n\n194\n00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:00.040\nor right, which is a little program that\nI wrote- I bought, I didn't write it.\n\n195\n00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.670\nI bought it so\nthat I could write mark down in it.\n\n196\n00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.070\nAnd so if I wanna install it,\nall I have to do is to click Install and\n\n197\n00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.280\nIt's gonna install cuz I\nalready bought it, right?\n\n198\n00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.600\nSo I don't have to buy again.\n\n199\n00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.970\nNow, it's gonna ask me for my credentials,\nunless it's managed to save them.\n\n200\n00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:14.900\nSo it' probably gonna prompt me.\n\n201\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.420\nI guess it already saved them.\n\n202\n00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.250\nSo it's gonna go in and\ndownload that and get it.\n\n203\n00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.560\nNow if there was another\nfree app that I wanted,\n\n204\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.370\nsomething that I hadn't bought already.\n\n205\n00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.370\nI don't know, let's say-\n>> Blitz is calling your\n\n206\n00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.560\nname, Don [LAUGH].\n\n207\n00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.670\n>> World of Tank Blitz, I don't,\nlet's see how big it is.\n\n208\n00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.310\nI don't wanna get something that's\nlike 20 gigs in size [LAUGH].\n\n209\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.670\nYou do kinda watch out for\nthe size of some of these things.\n\n210\n00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.200\nIt's 1.7 gigs.\n\n211\n00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.422\nThat's a little-\n>> It is large one.\n\n212\n00:09:39.422 --> 00:09:40.430\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, let's see if we can't find\n\n213\n00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.470\nsomething small.\n\n214\n00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.690\nSo if I wanna go and get an app here and\nit's free, you still have to authenticate.\n\n215\n00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.720\nYou have to provide a username and\npassword to show that you are the one who\n\n216\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.180\nis downloading it and that it's okay.\n\n217\n00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.790\nBut I know that I should be able to\ntrust it, so if I take Shazam, right?\n\n218\n00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.910\nShazam, which helps you to identify music,\nright, so I'm gonna get that one.\n\n219\n00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.330\nIt's free, I'll choose to install the app,\nnow it's asking for\n\n220\n00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.530\nthat user name and password.\n\n221\n00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.280\nSo I've gotta provide my credentials\nto say that I am who I say I am,\n\n222\n00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.490\nand I wanna allow that app to install.\n\n223\n00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.367\nSo those are installing now, okay?\n\n224\n00:10:12.367 --> 00:10:15.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> They will be when you get the user\n\n225\n00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.250\nname and password-\n>> If you know what your password is,\n\n226\n00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.232\nyeah let's try that again.\n\n227\n00:10:18.232 --> 00:10:24.750\nNow, because this is free app,\nit's asking, do I always wanna require\n\n228\n00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.810\nin a password when making purchases or\ndo I want to store it for 15 minutes?\n\n229\n00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.240\nNow that's dangerous, if you have kids,\nyou buy an app for them and\n\n230\n00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.960\nthey have a 15 minute window where\nthey can do in-app purchases and\n\n231\n00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.440\nthings and not require a password.\n\n232\n00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.490\nI always choose, always require.\n\n233\n00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.860\nBut it's up to you how\nyou want to set that.\n\n234\n00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.180\nNow, it's gonna take it and\nit's gonna install it.\n\n235\n00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.890\nAnd you'll see my downloads\nare automatically being installed on\n\n236\n00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.160\nother Macs, which is great.\n\n237\n00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.900\nNow it's gonna install on\nother machines of mine.\n\n238\n00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.340\nBut anyhow, it's gonna get installed and\nI've got that app.\n\n239\n00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.450\nNow, where does the app go?\n\n240\n00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.160\nWell, the app is just going\nto my Applications folder.\n\n241\n00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.860\nSo if I go into my Applications folder and\nlook here, I should have Shazam.\n\n242\n00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.380\nAnd I should have the Writer program,\nright?\n\n243\n00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.930\nThere's Write, it's already installed.\n\n244\n00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:07.580\nAnd there's Shazaam.\n\n245\n00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.760\nSo, the programs are installed and\nthey're ready to go.\n\n246\n00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.640\nA couple of things about this.\n\n247\n00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.150\nThe biggest advantage of the App Store in\nmy opinion is when an update comes out,\n\n248\n00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.830\nit updates through the App Store.\n\n249\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.040\nSo your app store is checking for\nupdates periodically.\n\n250\n00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.072\nAnd if an update for Shazaam comes out or\nan update for Write comes out.\n\n251\n00:11:26.072 --> 00:11:28.870\nIt's gonna automatically download and\ninstall it or\n\n252\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.360\nI'll at least get a prompt that\nwarns me and tells me to do it.\n\n253\n00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.190\nIf I downloaded this from a third party\nsite it's up to me to go and check for\n\n254\n00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.790\nthat update.\n\n255\n00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.820\nDid a new version come out,\nI got to go look.\n\n256\n00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.600\nOr something like Microsoft\nhas this really clunky\n\n257\n00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.210\ndownloader that has to launch once a week.\n\n258\n00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.960\nSo it's a program that\nlaunches once a week.\n\n259\n00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.800\nAnd it checks for the updates and\nit's kind of annoying.\n\n260\n00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.090\nIt's not automatic in the background.\n\n261\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.100\nIt's not one button and\nyou're done, like the App Store is.\n\n262\n00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.490\nFor the store, it's just one button, it\nupdates and you're in business, all right.\n\n263\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.070\nNow we can tweak those updates.\n\n264\n00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:57.250\nSo I go back to my App Store.\n\n265\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.750\nYou can go up to App Store and\ninto its settings.\n\n266\n00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.760\nAnd the settings are actually buried\naway under system preferences.\n\n267\n00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.360\nSo, here I am in my App Store menu, and\n\n268\n00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.310\nsee how I don't have much\nhere as far as options.\n\n269\n00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:14.220\nBut if I go under System Preferences,\nand we poke around in here, you can\n\n270\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.710\nfind the App Store, right here, and\nwe can get into the preferences for it.\n\n271\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.190\nAnd you'll see that it's set to\nautomatically check for updates.\n\n272\n00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.140\nNow, I haven't changed these.\n\n273\n00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.770\nThese are the default options.\n\n274\n00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.270\nIt's gonna check for updates.\n\n275\n00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.310\nIt's gonna download updates\nas soon as they're found.\n\n276\n00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.860\nSo it's gonna download it but\nnot install it yet.\n\n277\n00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.690\nIt's gonna download it and hold on to it.\n\n278\n00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.220\nBut then I have it set to\ninstall the app updates.\n\n279\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.210\nSo it will download and\ninstall the app update,\n\n280\n00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.640\nI don't even have to get involved,\nto a new version of Shazam comes out.\n\n281\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.100\nNew version of Wright comes out.\n\n282\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.470\nThe update, it's in.\n\n283\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:45.730\nIt's done.\n\n284\n00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.440\nI didn't, I never even think about it.\n\n285\n00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.580\nNow my system stays up to date,\n\n286\n00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.670\nand it stays more secure,\nstays more reliable, and I'm covered.\n\n287\n00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.150\nYou can do the same thing with\noperating system updates too, right.\n\n288\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.590\nBut we're talking about applications here.\n\n289\n00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.710\nThen you've got this.\n\n290\n00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.990\nAutomatically download apps\npurchased on other Macs.\n\n291\n00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.110\nIf I go to another Mac, and\nI log in as me and I'm buying an app.\n\n292\n00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.360\nIf this is checked,\nIt'll install here too.\n\n293\n00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.840\nIf it's unchecked, it won't.\n\n294\n00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.110\nI normally keep it unchecked because\nI might be logged in to more\n\n295\n00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.640\nthan one machine.\n\n296\n00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.210\nAnd I've different needs for one.\n\n297\n00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.370\nI might have one machine use for\nhere on the show.\n\n298\n00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.780\nAnd another that I use privately or\nwhatever.\n\n299\n00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.430\nYou can kind of designate it out.\n\n300\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.200\nYou can do separate Apple id's too.\n\n301\n00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.730\nI actually have two different ones.\n\n302\n00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.390\nBut it's up to you if you\nwant to turn that on.\n\n303\n00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.930\nAnd then the check, notice that my last\ncheck was Wednesday, March 9th, 2016.\n\n304\n00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.020\nWell, it's March 30th.\n\n305\n00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.910\nThis isn't checked in forever, right?\n\n306\n00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.070\nWhy is that?\n\n307\n00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.500\nWell, the reason is, this is a virtual\nmachine that I cloned from a template that\n\n308\n00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.360\nI haven't launched since March 9th,\nthat's why.\n\n309\n00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.350\nBut the reality is that it doesn't\ncheck for updates everyday.\n\n310\n00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.150\nIt usually checks about every four days or\nso.\n\n311\n00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.750\nThere's things you can do\nto spur it on to check, and\n\n312\n00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.988\nI can hit Check Now to make it check.\n\n313\n00:13:50.988 --> 00:13:51.821\nWell now.\n\n314\n00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:55.150\n[LAUGH] And look and\nsee if I get an update.\n\n315\n00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:59.420\nSo I can force that and looks like I had a\ncamera update for the operating system but\n\n316\n00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.380\nno application update\nto speak of just yet.\n\n317\n00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.250\nIt install some more\napplications I really get that.\n\n318\n00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.990\nBut they're installed.\n\n319\n00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.450\nNow the key thing that I wanna point out\nis that installing application through\n\n320\n00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:14.940\nthe App Store is different than\ninstalling it from a website, right?\n\n321\n00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.700\nSo let's say I wanna install\nsomething from a website.\n\n322\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.200\nI'm gonna install Cyberduck.\n\n323\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.085\nSo, Cyberduck is a little\nsecure FTP client that I use,\n\n324\n00:14:22.085 --> 00:14:24.110\nit's a free program that's out there.\n\n325\n00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.750\nLet me just go and find it.\n\n326\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.800\nWe'll jump over to Cyberduck's website.\n\n327\n00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.560\nI could have hit go to download.\n\n328\n00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.660\nThere was a nice little\nshortcut right there for me.\n\n329\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.590\nSo I'm gonna download this.\n\n330\n00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.710\nAnd this is a great example here.\n\n331\n00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.150\nI go to a third-party website.\n\n332\n00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.730\nI wanna download Cyberduck, okay?\n\n333\n00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.460\nSo I go to cyberduck.io.\n\n334\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.760\nDo I actually know if\nthat's their website?\n\n335\n00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.220\nI don't know.\n\n336\n00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.140\nI don't go to it every day.\n\n337\n00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.720\nIt could be that I got\na bad Google result.\n\n338\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.560\nI don't know.\n>> You're trusting it.\n\n339\n00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.790\n>> I am.\nI'm trusting that this is\n\n340\n00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.880\nthe right website.\n\n341\n00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.850\nAnd then I get here and there's\nthis great big Download Now button.\n\n342\n00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.440\nI'm gonna go and download it.\n\n343\n00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.300\nBut I might miss the fact that\nthis is actually an advertisement.\n\n344\n00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.600\nThis an advertisement for\nPDF Pronto that I've never even heard of.\n\n345\n00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.850\nI've got the little Ad Choices\nbuttons right hear.\n\n346\n00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.840\nThat's the only way that I could\ntell that was an advertisement and\n\n347\n00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.900\nI could misinterpret that and\nhit Download Now.\n\n348\n00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.440\nI'm not downloading CyberDuck now,\n\n349\n00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.340\nI'm downloading some software\nthat I didn't expect.\n\n350\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.690\nThat's the risk that we don't\nhave with the App Store.\n\n351\n00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.220\nYou know what you're\ngetting in the App Store.\n\n352\n00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.500\nAnd so then I can scroll down and\nI can find that download from Mac,\n\n353\n00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.590\nand it turns out the Cyberduck\nis in the app store also.\n\n354\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.550\nBut remember what I said\nabout how the vendors have to\n\n355\n00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.620\npay money to get their apps and\nstuff like that?\n\n356\n00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.450\nIf I download it here,\nit's completely free.\n\n357\n00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:36.040\nLet me show you Cyberduck\nin the app store.\n\n358\n00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.370\nSo, if I go, and I wanna get it from\nthe App Store, knowing that I can trust\n\n359\n00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:45.354\nthe download, and it'll automatically\nupdate, and I can pay $24 for it, right?\n\n360\n00:15:45.354 --> 00:15:48.843\nSo, $24 in the App Store,\nfree on their website.\n\n361\n00:15:48.843 --> 00:15:50.931\nAnd then it just encourages\nyou to make donations.\n\n362\n00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:52.239\nIt's Donationware.\n\n363\n00:15:52.239 --> 00:15:55.604\nIt's good software, you should send\nthem some money But he charges money in\n\n364\n00:15:55.604 --> 00:15:58.866\nthe App Store because you're getting\nthe convenience of autoupdates and\n\n365\n00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:00.930\nit costs him money to have\nit in the app stores.\n\n366\n00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.070\nSo that's kinda where\nthat breakdown happens.\n\n367\n00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.600\nSo I'm gonna download it here on my own,\nknowing that I'll have to update it.\n\n368\n00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.510\nBut I don't get the kind of\nbenefits of that App Store site.\n\n369\n00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.260\n>> Now a lot of apps,\n\n370\n00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.530\nthey do have automatic updates\nbuilt into their own system.\n\n371\n00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.630\nI use GNS3, and sometimes I don't use\nit for a while, cuz I'm not studying or\n\n372\n00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.970\nworking with that environment.\n\n373\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.481\nBut every time I launch GNS3, it will\ndo an automatic search for updates so\n\n374\n00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:27.120\nsometimes that does happen, and\nthat's a help, but still, it's up to me.\n\n375\n00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.553\n>> And it's inconvenient, so, hey,\nI want to write a Word document.\n\n376\n00:16:30.553 --> 00:16:32.520\nThis happens to me with\nExcel all the time.\n\n377\n00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.090\nHey, I wanna do a spreadsheet,\nso I fire up Excel.\n\n378\n00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.230\n>> And then the updater kicks in.\n\n379\n00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.888\nI need to do this worksheet,\nI don't have time to do the update.\n\n380\n00:16:38.888 --> 00:16:40.456\nCancel, right.\n\n381\n00:16:40.456 --> 00:16:43.472\nAnd if you let it go, then you got to\nwait ten minutes just to do the sheet.\n\n382\n00:16:43.472 --> 00:16:47.280\nWith the App Store,\nthe updates happen in the background.\n\n383\n00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.460\nIt's just already updated.\n\n384\n00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.610\nSo when I launch it, it's done.\n\n385\n00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.184\nI can get right into what I want,\nthat's kind of the advantage there.\n\n386\n00:16:52.184 --> 00:16:55.390\nAll right, so\nI downloaded CyberDuck, it's done.\n\n387\n00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.910\nAnd it's just in my Downloads folder.\n\n388\n00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.420\nSo here's my CyberDuck app and\nI'm just gonna drag that and\n\n389\n00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.750\ndrop that into my Applications folder.\n\n390\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:08.160\nAnd so now when I go into Applications and\nlook in here, I can find CyberDuck.\n\n391\n00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.280\nI can find Shazam somewhere in here,\nright here, and I can find Write.\n\n392\n00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.408\nThere's those three applications.\n\n393\n00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.790\nCyberDuck, I sideloaded.\n\n394\n00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.210\nShazam and\nWrite I installed through the App Store.\n\n395\n00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.660\nFor an end user,\nthey look the same, don't they?\n\n396\n00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.070\nWell, there's some differences.\n\n397\n00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:24.392\nLet me show you the difference.\n\n398\n00:17:24.392 --> 00:17:28.580\nFirst off, if I fire up Write, so I wanna\nfire up Write and write some markdown.\n\n399\n00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.670\nOkay, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nlaunch it, and\n\n400\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.590\nwhen I launch that application\nthe first time, here it is.\n\n401\n00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.280\nIt's my little Getting Started,\nI can sync to iCloud or Dropbox.\n\n402\n00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.229\nI'll just do on my Mac.\n\n403\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:41.340\nAnd we'll jump in here.\n\n404\n00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:44.597\nLet me skip the intro and\nI'm ready to start writing.\n\n405\n00:17:44.597 --> 00:17:46.320\nOkay, so\nhere I can fire up a new document.\n\n406\n00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.590\nI can create a note and\nnow I can start writing, all right?\n\n407\n00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.883\nAnd it is just my little mark down thing,\nso\n\n408\n00:17:53.883 --> 00:17:58.300\nyou can do all sorts of stuff with it and\nget it going and you're in business.\n\n409\n00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.800\nRight, I ran the app and it's good to go.\n\n410\n00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.100\nIt's a trusted application.\n\n411\n00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.630\nBut what if I do the same\nthing with Cyberduck?\n\n412\n00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.220\nI just downloaded Cyberduck\nfrom the Internet, right.\n\n413\n00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.860\nSo is that a trusted application?\n\n414\n00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.320\nWell, I don't know.\n\n415\n00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:16.160\nSo if I go in here and\nI fire up Cyberduck, what does it do?\n\n416\n00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.940\nWell, I get a prompt.\n\n417\n00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.970\nCyberduck is an application\ndownloaded from the Internet.\n\n418\n00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:21.339\nAre you sure you want to open it?\n\n419\n00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.570\nIs it trustworthy or not, right?\n\n420\n00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:29.000\nWhat happens is when you download\nan application, the vendor has a choice.\n\n421\n00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.959\nThey can get it digitally\nsigned from Apple.\n\n422\n00:18:30.959 --> 00:18:34.000\nAnd if it's digitally signed,\nyou'll see a message like this.\n\n423\n00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.910\nAnd you can choose to open it up and\nnow it's going to run.\n\n424\n00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.650\nIf it's not digitally signed,\nyou don't even get the Open option.\n\n425\n00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.284\nIt says, this is from an untrusted\nprovider, and that's the end of it.\n\n426\n00:18:43.284 --> 00:18:46.770\nAll right,\nthat's a little process called Gatekeeper.\n\n427\n00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:51.740\nGatekeeper runs in the background and it\nstops unauthorized software from running.\n\n428\n00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:57.130\nIf you have an untrusted application that\nis not signed by Apple, it won't run.\n\n429\n00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.040\nGatekeeper will stop it.\n\n430\n00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.220\nAnd then you got two choices.\n\n431\n00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.090\nOne, you can turn off Gatekeeper,\nwhich is not a great idea.\n\n432\n00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.680\nOr two, you can bypass Gatekeeper for\nthis one application.\n\n433\n00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.570\nIf you need to do that,\nwhat you do is you find the applications,\n\n434\n00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:14.020\nlike Cyberduck, and\nyou Ctrl+Click on it and choose Open.\n\n435\n00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.420\nWhen you manually choose the Open option,\n\n436\n00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.430\nthen you'll still get the Gatekeeper\nwarning but you'll have the Open button.\n\n437\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.900\nYou can hit Open and it'll launch.\n\n438\n00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.320\nAnd so that's how you get past it.\n\n439\n00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.150\nOnly an administrator can do that.\n\n440\n00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.250\nA standard user can't.\n\n441\n00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.290\nA standard user cannot bypass Gatekeeper.\n\n442\n00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.778\nSo you might have to disable it or\n\n443\n00:19:29.778 --> 00:19:33.320\nyou might have to change the way that\nGatekeeper works, and you can do that.\n\n444\n00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.810\nIt's tucked away in our\nsystem preferences.\n\n445\n00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:40.430\nIf I go back into my System Preferences,\nand I go into Security and Privacy.\n\n446\n00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:45.310\nInside of Security and Privacy,\nit's right here on the General tab,\n\n447\n00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.972\nright down here at the bottom,\nAllow Apps Downloaded From.\n\n448\n00:19:48.972 --> 00:19:52.240\nAnd by default,\nlet me unlock this real quick.\n\n449\n00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:57.480\nBy default, it's set to Mac App Store,\nand Identified developers.\n\n450\n00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.430\nCyberDuck is an identified\ndeveloper from Apple.\n\n451\n00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.940\nThey're digitally signed with\na certificate that Apple trusts.\n\n452\n00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.020\nSo that's why it let me open that.\n\n453\n00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.570\nAnd the ones from the App Store\nthey're allowed to open, too.\n\n454\n00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.460\nBut if I get a program that is not signed,\n\n455\n00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.470\nit's just from a third party site,\nit's not going to allow it to run.\n\n456\n00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.940\nAnd I'll have to bypass Gatekeeper for\nthat.\n\n457\n00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.322\nI can say only allow\nit from the App Store.\n\n458\n00:20:19.322 --> 00:20:21.959\nI'm gonna be really strict,\njust App Store apps and that's it.\n\n459\n00:20:21.959 --> 00:20:24.870\nOr I could disable Gatekeeper and\nallow it from anywhere.\n\n460\n00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.020\nAnd you get that nice big warning,\nare you sure you wanna do that?\n\n461\n00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.860\nAnd I don't so\nI'm going to cancel that, but\n\n462\n00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.020\nso that's where you can change\nthat Gatekeeper function.\n\n463\n00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.100\nNow notice how it doesn't say\nGatekeeper anywhere here on this page.\n\n464\n00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.340\nThe technology is called Gatekeeper, and\non the exam they'll refer to it that way.\n\n465\n00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.610\nSo be familiar with that name.\n\n466\n00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:41.660\nThat's the official name for\n\n467\n00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.601\nit, even though this little area here\ndoesn't show that name, all right.\n\n468\n00:20:45.601 --> 00:20:47.980\nSo that's a risk we take\nwhen we sideload apps.\n\n469\n00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.890\nWhen we get our own programs\nwe need to be aware of that.\n\n470\n00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:54.060\nBut the other thing is, apps that\nare downloaded and sideloaded are treated\n\n471\n00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.320\ndifferently than apps that\nare installed through the App Store.\n\n472\n00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.810\nAnd let me show you what I mean.\n\n473\n00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:02.890\nWhen I go in to that Applications folder,\nthe apps are right here and\n\n474\n00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.360\nthey really don't look any different.\n\n475\n00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.957\nSo I see, well, I try to see Cyberduck.\n\n476\n00:21:07.957 --> 00:21:10.941\nI scroll down I see Shazam, I see Write,\nthey're all just sitting here.\n\n477\n00:21:10.941 --> 00:21:11.782\nThey look the same.\n\n478\n00:21:11.782 --> 00:21:13.530\nThey're just programs, I run them.\n\n479\n00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.059\nAnd in fact,\nnow that I've run Cyberduck one time,\n\n480\n00:21:16.059 --> 00:21:19.296\nit's not gonna warn me anymore\nabout it being untrusted, right.\n\n481\n00:21:19.296 --> 00:21:22.402\nSo if I go back here, and\nI run Cyberduck again,\n\n482\n00:21:22.402 --> 00:21:25.810\nit's just gonna launch and\nthere's no prompts.\n\n483\n00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.460\nSo now it's effectively\nthe same as the others, right?\n\n484\n00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.855\nNot exactly, all right.\n\n485\n00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:32.360\nPermissions are a little\nbit different here.\n\n486\n00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:37.110\nWhen I install an app myself from\nthe Internet, the app gets sandboxed.\n\n487\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.300\nIt's sandboxed and\nprotected from all the other apps, so\n\n488\n00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.880\none app can't start to mess around with\nthe other apps that are out there.\n\n489\n00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.290\nIt's isolated.\n\n490\n00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.560\nAnd that sandbox is done by\ntying it to my user account.\n\n491\n00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.400\nWhen I install from the App Store,\nit's a trusted app.\n\n492\n00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.280\nIt doesn't have to be\ntied to my user account.\n\n493\n00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.306\nIt can still be sandboxed,\nbut it's trusted so\n\n494\n00:21:53.306 --> 00:21:54.936\nit can have a little bit more freedom.\n\n495\n00:21:54.936 --> 00:21:57.550\nI say that, that's the Apple line.\n\n496\n00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.870\nIn reality, App Store apps\nare a little more restricted.\n\n497\n00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:03.291\nBut on the exam we say\nthey have more freedom,\n\n498\n00:22:03.291 --> 00:22:06.875\nmore freedom to operate properly\nwithin the boundaries of Apple.\n\n499\n00:22:06.875 --> 00:22:09.314\nSo either way, the point is,\nyou don't see it.\n\n500\n00:22:09.314 --> 00:22:10.405\n>> You don't see equilibrium?\n\n501\n00:22:10.405 --> 00:22:15.410\n[LAUGH]\n>> You want to kill all your emotions.\n\n502\n00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.670\nSo anyhow, the apps are different though.\n\n503\n00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.030\nAnd let me, I'm just blabbering now.\n\n504\n00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.330\nLet me show you here in the terminal so\n\n505\n00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:25.210\nI can actually prove this point\ninstead of going on and on.\n\n506\n00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.450\nSo if I jump down into the terminal and\n\n507\n00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:32.290\nI browse into the Applications folder,\nright.\n\n508\n00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:36.891\nSo I'm gonna just kinda dig down\nin here and get into Applications.\n\n509\n00:22:36.891 --> 00:22:40.247\nAll right, and I'm gonna do an ls -la.\n\n510\n00:22:40.247 --> 00:22:42.500\nSo I'm gonna do a list.\n\n511\n00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.110\nI want the long view, so\nI see all the nitty gritty details.\n\n512\n00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:47.250\nAnd I'm gonna Show All Files,\neven hidden ones.\n\n513\n00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:51.200\nAnd I'm gonna look for,\nwe'll start with Cyberduck, okay.\n\n514\n00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.090\nSo I wanna find Cyberduck, and shoot,\n\n515\n00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:57.030\nthat's gonna show me\nwhat's in the directory.\n\n516\n00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:57.620\nWell, shoot.\n\n517\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.230\nLet me just do a full on ls-la.\n\n518\n00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.380\nWe'll find it this way.\n\n519\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.880\nAll right, and so actually here,\nI just want this be a little cleaner.\n\n520\n00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.380\nLet me just grab that for Cyberduck.\n\n521\n00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.550\nThere we go.\n\n522\n00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.680\nSo here's the Cyberduck app that\nI downloaded from the Internet.\n\n523\n00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.540\nAnd you can kind of see the sandboxing,\nwho owns it, dpezet.\n\n524\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.620\nI own it, I'm the one who installed it,\nI'm the owner.\n\n525\n00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.190\nAnd then the group is staff.\n\n526\n00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.850\nThat's anybody else who has\na user account on this machine.\n\n527\n00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.946\nSo we're the people that own it,\nand when we run it,\n\n528\n00:23:24.946 --> 00:23:27.247\nthe best privileges it's gonna\nget by default are mine.\n\n529\n00:23:27.247 --> 00:23:30.130\nAnd if I'm a regular user,\nthat's pretty limited, right?\n\n530\n00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.200\nSo that's what it's tied to,\nit's tied to me.\n\n531\n00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.430\nBut if I do that same thing for Write.\n\n532\n00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.670\nSo here's the Write app that I\ninstalled from the App Store.\n\n533\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.100\nAnd when you look at it,\nwho owns that one?\n\n534\n00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:44.420\nRoot.\n\n535\n00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.867\nThe system owns it.\n\n536\n00:23:45.867 --> 00:23:50.269\nThis is a trusted app\nthat Apple authorized.\n\n537\n00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:53.895\nAnd so they let it run from the system.\n\n538\n00:23:53.895 --> 00:23:57.290\nThat's where it gets that additional\npower, elevated privileges.\n\n539\n00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.120\nWe can grant that to third party apps,\nbut they're not trusted by default,\n\n540\n00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.740\nthey don't get those privileges.\n\n541\n00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.090\nSo this one is owned by the system.\n\n542\n00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:07.867\nNow to an end user, that's really not\ngonna make much difference, right?\n\n543\n00:24:07.867 --> 00:24:12.082\nBut it can influence\nthe way this stuff works.\n\n544\n00:24:12.082 --> 00:24:14.810\nFor example, what you can do is.\n\n545\n00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.070\nWell here, let me show you the difference\nthe way the end user would see it.\n\n546\n00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:22.250\nWhat if I wanna uninstall the app,\nI want to get rid of it?\n\n547\n00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:27.030\nWell, for an end user for a normal app,\nthey browse to their applications folder.\n\n548\n00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.860\nThey find Cyberduck.\n\n549\n00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.730\nAnd they just drag it and\ndrop it into their trash, right?\n\n550\n00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.090\nWhich is under my head.\n\n551\n00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:37.880\nBut if I drag old Cyberduck down and\nI drop that on my trash, it's gone.\n\n552\n00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.800\nI didn't get any prompts, any warnings.\n\n553\n00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.820\nIt's just gone.\n\n554\n00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:46.120\nIf I try and take Write and drag that and\ndrop it into the trash, what happens?\n\n555\n00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.660\nIt prompts me for admin credentials.\n\n556\n00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.860\nWhy?\n\n557\n00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.270\nCuz I don't own it!\n\n558\n00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.210\nRoot owns it.\n\n559\n00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.140\nIt's owned by Root, not me.\n\n560\n00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.840\nBut an end user could install apps,\nthey can't remove them?\n\n561\n00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.840\nWell, that's not necessarily true.\n\n562\n00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.910\nWhat it does,\nit treats it more like an iPad, right?\n\n563\n00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:05.540\nIf you fire up your launch pad.\n\n564\n00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.070\nSo, if i go to my launch pad view,\nI see all my apps, and\n\n565\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.510\nthere's Shazam and there's Write.\n\n566\n00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:15.790\nIf I click and hold my mouse like\nyou'd hold a finger on your iPad,\n\n567\n00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:19.450\neverything starts to shake\njust like on an iPad.\n\n568\n00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.850\nWell, if I hadn't zoomed in, there we go.\n\n569\n00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.990\nEverything starts to\nshake like on an iPad.\n\n570\n00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.850\nAnd I got little Xs.\n\n571\n00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.890\nAnd see how there's no Xs\non these guys up here?\n\n572\n00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:28.640\nThose are system apps.\n\n573\n00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.450\nThey're part of OS10.\n\n574\n00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.830\nThey're part of the system.\n\n575\n00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.130\nI can't mess with those.\n\n576\n00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:35.080\nBut Write,\nI installed that from the App Store.\n\n577\n00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.110\nAnd if I click on that X,\nI'm saying I don't want it anymore,\n\n578\n00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:39.452\nlet's get rid of it.\n\n579\n00:25:39.452 --> 00:25:41.850\nAnd [LAUGH].\n\n580\n00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.620\n>> And you can't.\n>> I know if I try and click on it.\n\n581\n00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.390\nWhat is it doing?\n\n582\n00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:49.285\nPlease go away.\n\n583\n00:25:49.285 --> 00:25:49.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So anyhow,\n\n584\n00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.700\nwhat you're supposed to do is click on it\nand it goes away, and something is wrong.\n\n585\n00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.585\nMy mouse is not clicking when I'm\nin the shake view for some reason.\n\n586\n00:25:55.585 --> 00:25:56.371\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n587\n00:25:56.371 --> 00:25:58.981\nnormally I click on it and it goes away,\nand it doesn't prompt you for\n\n588\n00:25:58.981 --> 00:26:01.240\nthose admin credentials cuz\nyou are allowed to install it.\n\n589\n00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.460\nYou're doing it through the App Store.\n\n590\n00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.610\nThis is the officially supported way.\n\n591\n00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.330\nI apologize,\nI don't know why my mouse is not.\n\n592\n00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.090\n>> It's gotta be something with the VM.\n\n593\n00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:13.288\n>> Yeah, it's probably intercepting my,\nwell now I'm really screwed.\n\n594\n00:26:13.288 --> 00:26:15.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So [LAUGH] anyhow, so\n\n595\n00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.220\nwe get rid of it that way.\n\n596\n00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.440\nSo it's handled differently, right?\n\n597\n00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.750\nAnd this is why we don't\nblend iPads with desktops.\n\n598\n00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.320\nI don't know why Apple hasn't\nquite learned that lesson.\n\n599\n00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.980\nSo that's kinda the key secret there,\nis that those apps are a little bit\n\n600\n00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.760\ndifferent than what we\nhave when we side load.\n\n601\n00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.990\nSo two differences there with\nhow we manage those apps.\n\n602\n00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:34.810\nThere's one more thing I wanna mention,\nand\n\n603\n00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.000\nthis one it kinda goes\noff the beaten path.\n\n604\n00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.510\nIt's not something we'd\nencounter in real life, but\n\n605\n00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.230\nit is something you might\nencounter on the exam.\n\n606\n00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.180\nWhen I talk about an application,\n\n607\n00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.890\nit's normally an application that's\nright there in your applications folder.\n\n608\n00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.860\nSomething you run, you use it in your user\ninterface, and you see it and there it is,\n\n609\n00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:49.830\neverything's very exciting.\n\n610\n00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:55.340\nBut there's also dashboard widgets.\n\n611\n00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:59.810\nNow, if you're like me, you're thinking\nwhat the heck is a dashboard widget,\n\n612\n00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:00.920\nwhat is Don talking about?\n\n613\n00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.320\n>> Is it like the Charms bar?\n\n614\n00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.404\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is!\n\n615\n00:27:03.404 --> 00:27:09.940\nA lot of people don't use this, but\nin Mac OS, there is this dashboard, right?\n\n616\n00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.050\nI'll just show you right\nhere on my laptop.\n\n617\n00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.510\nI disabled the thing, I hate it, but\na lot of people love it and they use it.\n\n618\n00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.190\nLet me turn on my dashboard real quick.\n\n619\n00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.310\nI'm gonna jump into my system\npreferences and turn this on.\n\n620\n00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:24.140\nIn your system preferences, the dashboard,\n\n621\n00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.890\nit's actually controlled\nby Mission Control.\n\n622\n00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.330\nSo I'm gonna go into Mission Control.\n\n623\n00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.500\nAnd in Mission Control, you can\nturn this dashboard on and off, and\n\n624\n00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.590\nyou see I've got mine off.\n\n625\n00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.510\nSo let me turn it back on,\nI'll turn it on as a space.\n\n626\n00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:35.810\nThat's the default.\n\n627\n00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:40.370\nSo by default, there's an extra\ndesktop space that exists.\n\n628\n00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.980\nAnd so, when I do my three finger\nswipe up, see how I've got my desktop,\n\n629\n00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.140\nI've got VMware Fusion, and\nnow I've got this dashboard.\n\n630\n00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.530\nI wouldn't have had that a minute\nago cuz I keep it turned off.\n\n631\n00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.420\nBut if I swipe over,\nhere's this dashboard.\n\n632\n00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.720\nThis dashboard that I\nliterally never use and\n\n633\n00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.720\nI turn it off on every\ncomputer that I use.\n\n634\n00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.619\nIt's just not something I use, right?\n\n635\n00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.570\nBut what it is, is a collection of\nwidgets, and those widgets, they're apps,\n\n636\n00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:04.500\nthey're programs.\n\n637\n00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.040\nThese are programs\nrunning on your computer.\n\n638\n00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.610\nAnd just like you could get a malicious\napp, you can get a malicious widget too,\n\n639\n00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.500\nand so you could have something\nhere that's doing bad things.\n\n640\n00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.630\nAnd so we have trusted widgets,\nand untrusted widgets.\n\n641\n00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.980\nWe have the same kind of restrictions with\napps that apply to these widgets too.\n\n642\n00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:25.290\nAnd so by default, I've got this super\nawesome calculator, and the weather, and\n\n643\n00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.940\na clock, and a calendar, and\nthey're amazing and great, right?\n\n644\n00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.280\nYou can hit the little\nplus sign down here,\n\n645\n00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.220\nand we can start to add more widgets.\n\n646\n00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.730\nAnd these are the widgets\nthat come with the system.\n\n647\n00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:35.670\nSo I can add ESPN.\n\n648\n00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.820\nSo I'm gonna add ESPN in.\n\n649\n00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.700\nAnd it's tied to your iCloud account,\nso it remembers that I like hockey.\n\n650\n00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.830\nAnd so it's showing me hockey\nscores by default, right?\n\n651\n00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:49.240\nBut all these widgets have settings\nthat you can go in and tweak and change.\n\n652\n00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.220\nAnd so, if I go in here, I can pick\nthe sport that I want it tied to.\n\n653\n00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.530\nSo, maybe I want,\ndefinitely not basketball.\n\n654\n00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:56.880\nHow about football?\n\n655\n00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.950\nSo, we'll switch it to football.\n\n656\n00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:00.840\nAnd so now it's gonna switch\nthose football scores.\n\n657\n00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.198\nWhile on the weather one, if we jump in\nto it, we might wanna set our location.\n\n658\n00:29:05.198 --> 00:29:08.310\nSo what you're looking for is when\nyou float your mouse over the widget,\n\n659\n00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:11.530\nthere's usually a little\nitalics letter i that appears.\n\n660\n00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:13.390\nSee that's appearing\ndown there in the corner?\n\n661\n00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:15.430\nAnd that's where you can into\nyour settings and so you can say,\n\n662\n00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:20.910\nhey we are in Gainesville Florida,\nwe do Fahrenheit, so that's what I want.\n\n663\n00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.710\nI'll hit Done, and so\n\n664\n00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:26.700\nnow we get the weather here where it is,\naccording to it, 69 degrees.\n\n665\n00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.300\n>> 69 degrees.\n\n666\n00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.100\n>> I can't believe that's right.\n\n667\n00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:28.740\n>> That's a lie.\n\n668\n00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.040\n>> That's what it says.\n\n669\n00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.570\nAll right, so anyhow, we can start to see\nthat weather, customize these things.\n\n670\n00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:37.780\nBut when you add those applications,\nthese are just ones that are built in.\n\n671\n00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.550\nWhen you install third party applications,\n\n672\n00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.570\nmany of them carry along\ntheir own widgets.\n\n673\n00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.252\nAnd so when you hit this plus sign,\n\n674\n00:29:43.252 --> 00:29:46.900\nyou might start to see widgets from\nother programs you've installed.\n\n675\n00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.480\nI haven't installed any,\nit's not terribly popular.\n\n676\n00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.140\nIn real life land, the odds are you never\neven use this, you never even see it,\n\n677\n00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.700\nyou never even care about it.\n\n678\n00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.600\nBut it is on the exam.\n\n679\n00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.270\nSo I wanted to kinda single it out,\nand show you guys that these widgets,\n\n680\n00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:01.510\nthey are programs, they are executables,\nthey are running on your system.\n\n681\n00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.950\nAnd, if you're like me, and\nyou never use the darn things?\n\n682\n00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:04.890\nTurn them off, right?\n\n683\n00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.630\nThat's the best way to do it, is just\ngo into your system preferences, and\n\n684\n00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.840\ngo into Mission Control.\n\n685\n00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:15.670\nAnd where it says, the dashboard shows up\nas a space, I just turn the thing off.\n\n686\n00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.930\nTurn it off and that way the dashboard\ndoesn't exist, it's not there,\n\n687\n00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:23.650\nthose widgets aren't running unless you\nspecifically go into Mission Control, and\n\n688\n00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:25.130\nthen you'll trigger that and launch it.\n\n689\n00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.650\nBut I just turn the thing off and\nthat way I don't have to worry about it.\n\n690\n00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:32.403\nAnd now it doesn't show up in my desktops,\nand it's just not executing.\n\n691\n00:30:32.403 --> 00:30:35.470\nSo that's another example of\nan application that you might have\n\n692\n00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:36.378\non your system.\n\n693\n00:30:36.378 --> 00:30:40.280\nI doubt it'll show up on the exam,\nbut just for the thoroughness,\n\n694\n00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.760\nthose widgets are stored not in your\napplications folder, but in your library.\n\n695\n00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.952\nSo, where you'll expect to see those\nif I jump into my terminal here, and\n\n696\n00:30:48.952 --> 00:30:53.480\nlet me see how big I can make this,\nprobably about that big.\n\n697\n00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.080\nSo if I jump into my terminal here and\npoke around the two places the widgets\n\n698\n00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:02.760\nhide out is,\nwe got /Library/Widgets, right?\n\n699\n00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.600\nThat would be the system location,\nand so there I see Calculator, ESPN,\n\n700\n00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.540\nFlight Tracker, Web Clip, and so on.\n\n701\n00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.040\nThese are the ones that come with OS10.\n\n702\n00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.450\nAnd then the ones that we install\nend up under our user account.\n\n703\n00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:21.149\nSo if I go into\n/Users/donpezet/library/widgets,oh,\n\n704\n00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:23.510\nfolder doesn't exist.\n\n705\n00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:27.530\nSo I haven't installed any widgets so I\ndon't have them, but if I installed some,\n\n706\n00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:29.740\nthey would actually be right\nhere under that widgets folder.\n\n707\n00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.740\nSo be aware that those can show up there.\n\n708\n00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.330\nSame thing goes for applications.\n\n709\n00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:36.580\nRemember that when an administrator\ninstalls an application,\n\n710\n00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.210\nit shows up under\nthe /Applications folder.\n\n711\n00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.160\nBut if an end user installs\nan application and\n\n712\n00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.390\nthey don't have admin privileges,\nit'll end up going in their user folder.\n\n713\n00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:51.910\nSo it will go under\n/users/donpezet/library, or not library.\n\n714\n00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.040\nJust /applications.\n\n715\n00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.500\nThere we go.\nSo it'll show up there.\n\n716\n00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.530\nIf they haven't done anything like that,\nthen it would be separate.\n\n717\n00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.180\nBut here you can see where I've installed\n\n718\n00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.687\nsome mission critical\napps like GoToMeeting.\n\n719\n00:31:59.687 --> 00:32:01.310\n>> Gotta have that.\n>> GoToMeeting, and\n\n720\n00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.750\nBaldur's Gate II Enhanced Edition,\nvery important stuff.\n\n721\n00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:09.860\nSo I installed these, and maybe I was in a\nhurry and didn't give it admin privileges.\n\n722\n00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.740\nOr maybe just that app chose\nto install in my user space.\n\n723\n00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.360\nSome of the installers will ask you, do\nyou want to make this available for you or\n\n724\n00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.390\nfor everyone?\n\n725\n00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:17.860\nAnd maybe I chose just me.\n\n726\n00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.480\nWell, I'm the only one who uses this\nlaptop, so it didn't really matter.\n\n727\n00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.660\nBut now I've got it right here, and\nthat's tied to just my account.\n\n728\n00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.910\nSo just a couple little odds and ends you\nmight bump into in the real world, but\n\n729\n00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:29.390\nyou'll definitely bump into on the exam.\n\n730\n00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:32.440\n>> Yeah, my grandmother will be thrilled\nto find out there's widgets there.\n\n731\n00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.500\nThat's the kind of thing\nshe just goes nuts over.\n\n732\n00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.280\nRight, I'll just have every\none of them enabled, and\n\n733\n00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.392\nI'll be chomping off\na lid before too long.\n\n734\n00:32:39.392 --> 00:32:40.735\n[LAUGH]\n>> Gotta know those sports cars,\n\n735\n00:32:40.735 --> 00:32:41.412\nit's important.\n\n736\n00:32:41.412 --> 00:32:42.119\n>> Very important.\n\n737\n00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:44.740\nAll right Don, well now that we\nknow how to work with applications,\n\n738\n00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:48.240\nwe know how to get them installed, we\ncan use the app store, we can side load.\n\n739\n00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.990\nAnd if you're so inclined,\nyou can play with the widgets as well.\n\n740\n00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.390\nThat's all there for us.\n\n741\n00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:55.850\nYou've done a great job of explaining\nto us how we can get things installed,\n\n742\n00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:59.250\nhow we can uninstall them, and\nwork with those different systems.\n\n743\n00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:02.180\nIs there anything else that we need to\nadd to this episode before we wrap it up?\n\n744\n00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.600\n>> That's about it for applications.\n\n745\n00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.780\nObviously it's a big topic.\n\n746\n00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:08.070\nThere's a lot of things that come in\nplay that when you deploy a third-party\n\n747\n00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.620\napplication, you'll need to read that\nvendor's documentation to find out what\n\n748\n00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.590\nthey say they've got\ntheir own best practices.\n\n749\n00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:15.170\nBut for the exam, we've seen\neverything that Apple recommends, and\n\n750\n00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.094\nit's pretty straight forward.\n\n751\n00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:18.820\n>> All right, well thank you so\nmuch for explaining this for us, and\n\n752\n00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:22.870\nshowing us the way to get applications\ninstalled onto our Mac systems.\n\n753\n00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:25.690\nWith that being said, looks like we've\nwrapped up yet another great episode.\n\n754\n00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.140\nHopefully you've enjoyed it and\ngot a lot of it.\n\n755\n00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.830\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n756\n00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:31.620\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n757\n00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.615\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n758\n00:33:32.615 --> 00:33:41.270\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.497 --> 00:00:19.863\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we're continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:21.994\nour Apple Certified Support Professional\nseries.\n\n5\n00:00:21.994 --> 00:00:25.601\nAnd joining us back again today in our\nstudio to help us out that very endeavour\n\n6\n00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:28.020\nother than our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.070\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.910\nHow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.610\n>> It is going great, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.111\nThanks for having me back, and\n\n11\n00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:36.574\nI'm here to continue on our Apple Support\nProfessional journey, adventure, whatever.\n\n12\n00:00:36.574 --> 00:00:37.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n13\n00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.410\nthis is another one of those fun episodes\nwhere we're gonna dive into a topic that\n\n14\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.700\nis for all intense and\npurposes not stuff an end user.\n\n15\n00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.510\nThings that are hidden be scenes, these\nare my favorite things to learn and talk\n\n16\n00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.912\nabout because there is a lot of cool stuff\nthat goes on behinds the scenes in Mac OS.\n\n17\n00:00:53.912 --> 00:00:56.680\nThat if you embrace the magic of Mac OS,\n\n18\n00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.720\nyou'd never know about it, it's\nan operating system on training wheels.\n\n19\n00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.950\nBut behind the scenes is very powerful,\nthere's a lot of really cool stuff.\n\n20\n00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.563\nAnd so in this episode, we're gonna\ntake a look at one of those things and\n\n21\n00:01:06.563 --> 00:01:07.995\nthat's Application Data.\n\n22\n00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:12.546\nSo any application that you have, when\nyou fire up a program it has settings,\n\n23\n00:01:12.546 --> 00:01:15.708\nit has preferences,\nit has data it has information.\n\n24\n00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.839\nAnd it's gotta put it somewhere and\n\n25\n00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:22.540\nthe way that OS 10 is structure is that\ndata can end up a few different places.\n\n26\n00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.988\nSo we're gonna take look at those places\nwe're gonna find where those settings\n\n27\n00:01:25.988 --> 00:01:28.467\nare and get an idea of what that\nlooks like on the back end.\n\n28\n00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:32.849\nNow, I know what you're thinking, is hey,\nDon, if we're not supposed to see this,\n\n29\n00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:34.430\nthen, why do we care?\n\n30\n00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.418\nAnd well, you could follow that, right?\n\n31\n00:01:36.418 --> 00:01:39.610\nYou could say, I don't care,\nwhatever, it's all behind the scenes.\n\n32\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.090\nBut the moment you have a problem\nwith an application, and\n\n33\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.970\nyou have to try and\nfigure out what's going wrong with it,\n\n34\n00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.520\nyou're gonna wanna know\nwhere this date is.\n\n35\n00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.240\nAnd let me just give you a great example,\non the show, I use VMware Fusion a lot.\n\n36\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.143\nVMware Fusion,\n\n37\n00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:55.282\nit's a virtualization product that lets\nme have more than one Mac desktop.\n\n38\n00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:59.440\nI keep showing you guys a stock\ninstall of El Capitan in the show.\n\n39\n00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.970\nI didn't format my laptop before\nthe show to get a stock install.\n\n40\n00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.640\nI use a virtual machine for\nthat and VMware Fusion's great,\n\n41\n00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.930\nI can go into my preferences.\n\n42\n00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.620\nAnd I've got tons of little options in\nthere, things that I can check off and\n\n43\n00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.100\nsay, yes, I want this or\nno, I don't want that.\n\n44\n00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.610\nBut at the end of the day,\n\n45\n00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.550\nthere are some options that VMware Fusion\nhas that don't show up in the GUI.\n\n46\n00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.870\nThere are advanced options hidden away,\nand\n\n47\n00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.840\nyou can only get to them by messing with\nthe configuration files behind the scenes.\n\n48\n00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.430\nAnd I know what you're thinking,\nwell, Don, that's VMware,\n\n49\n00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.359\nApple would never do that.\n\n50\n00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.330\nApple does it.\n\n51\n00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.750\nThere's plenty of options that Apple has\nthat you can't adjust through the GUI.\n\n52\n00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.210\nSo for example, your Dock bar, right?\n\n53\n00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.070\nThe Dock at the bottom of your screen.\n\n54\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.790\nIf I want it to auto-hide,\nI can turn that option on.\n\n55\n00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.190\nIf I go into the Dock's preferences,\nit has an option for that.\n\n56\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.570\nBut when I put my mouse at\nthe bottom of the screen,\n\n57\n00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.080\nthe Dock automatically comes back up.\n\n58\n00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.990\nDo you know there is actually\na little bit of a delay?\n\n59\n00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.640\nYou mouse has to sit down there for like\nhalf a second before it actually pops up.\n\n60\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.570\nWhat if you wanna adjust that delay?\n\n61\n00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.840\nWhat if I wanted to wait five\nseconds before the bar comes up?\n\n62\n00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.220\nWell, guess what?\nThere's no GUI option for that, but\n\n63\n00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.740\nthere is an option.\n\n64\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.310\nApple just didn't put it in the GUI,\nso I can drop to the command-line and\n\n65\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.410\nI can modify the preferences for the Dock\nand I can add that five second delay in.\n\n66\n00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.986\nSo there's a lot of options that we can\ncustomize if we just know where to go,\n\n67\n00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:25.790\nwhere to go to find them and\nmove away from the training wheels.\n\n68\n00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.740\nMove away from the nice little\nGUI that makes things easy and\n\n69\n00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.755\ndive into the advance side, so\n\n70\n00:03:28.755 --> 00:03:30.802\nthat's what we're gonna look\nat right here in this episode.\n\n71\n00:03:30.802 --> 00:03:34.718\n>> So Don, there's really, our Mac OS is\nkinda like the Great and Powerful Oz.\n\n72\n00:03:34.718 --> 00:03:35.498\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n73\n00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:38.436\nthere's really a guy behind the curtain\nover there spinning dials and\n\n74\n00:03:38.436 --> 00:03:41.162\nturning cranks and stuff and\nthat's what we wanna learn today.\n\n75\n00:03:41.162 --> 00:03:44.340\nWe wanna become him so\nthat we can make our own OZ.\n\n76\n00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.420\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\nthat's exactly how this is,\n\n77\n00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.590\nwe're gonna have to pull\nthat curtain aside and look.\n\n78\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.164\nWhen you install an application,\nyou go out to the Internet,\n\n79\n00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:53.106\nyou find that application,\nyou download it.\n\n80\n00:03:53.106 --> 00:03:55.863\nAnd then, you drag and\ndrop it to your applications folder and\n\n81\n00:03:55.863 --> 00:03:57.730\nwe saw that in the applications episode.\n\n82\n00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.622\nIn fact, I downloaded Cyberduck, for\nexample here and let me show you.\n\n83\n00:04:01.622 --> 00:04:05.360\nSo I've got this, that is no longer\na stock [INAUDIBLE] about El Capitan.\n\n84\n00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.259\nI've got El Capitan and I've installed\nCyberduck and when I installed Cyberduck,\n\n85\n00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:12.260\nit's installed here somewhere.\n\n86\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.198\nI downloaded it from the website\nin my downloads folder, and\n\n87\n00:04:16.198 --> 00:04:18.143\nthen I just copied it into Applications.\n\n88\n00:04:18.143 --> 00:04:22.677\nAnd once it was copied into Applications,\nhere it is, it's installed, and\n\n89\n00:04:22.677 --> 00:04:24.299\nwhat are we doing here?\n\n90\n00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:27.180\nWhatever, so it's installed,\nand I've only done one thing.\n\n91\n00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.490\nI've added one FTP site to it, so\n\n92\n00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.150\nthere's a site that I go to when I\nneed to download a copy of Linux.\n\n93\n00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.420\nI added that site to Cyberduck, all right.\n\n94\n00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.388\nWell, the application itself is stored\nin the Applications folder, and\n\n95\n00:04:38.388 --> 00:04:41.210\nI know that I can browse\nto the Applications folder.\n\n96\n00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.209\nAnd I can find Cyberduck, and\nI learned from that other episode, right?\n\n97\n00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:49.911\nThat this is not a single file, this is a\nbundle, and so, if I Ctrl+click on it, and\n\n98\n00:04:49.911 --> 00:04:51.724\nchoose Show Package Contents.\n\n99\n00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:57.241\nI can browse inside of it, and we can\nstart to see what makes up that program.\n\n100\n00:04:57.241 --> 00:05:00.000\nAnd there's a lot of stuff in here, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.255\nAll of these are files that make Cyberduck\nwork, it uses a couple of libraries here.\n\n102\n00:05:07.255 --> 00:05:10.534\nIt's got some kind of sparkle framework,\nit's got extra sparkle,\n\n103\n00:05:10.534 --> 00:05:12.350\nDavid Beam will appreciate that one.\n\n104\n00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.891\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We've got our library settings down\n\n105\n00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:18.504\nhere, we've got all sorts\nof different things, but\n\n106\n00:05:18.504 --> 00:05:20.765\nI added an FTP server to this one.\n\n107\n00:05:20.765 --> 00:05:23.530\nI added ftp.usf.edu\n\n108\n00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.530\nis one of the colleges here in Florida\nthat makes Linux distros available.\n\n109\n00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.540\nI have a good connection cuz we're here\nin Florida also, so we can reach out and\n\n110\n00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.670\ndownload those nice and fast.\n\n111\n00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.230\nI added it, where is it in here?\n\n112\n00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.310\nWell, the short answer\nis it's nowhere in here.\n\n113\n00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.745\nApplications don't store their settings\nin the application itself, and\n\n114\n00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:41.772\nthere's a very important reason for that.\n\n115\n00:05:41.772 --> 00:05:46.240\nWhen you download an application,\nit needs to be digitally signed.\n\n116\n00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.886\nIf it's from the App Store it's digitally\nsigned by Apple, if it's downloaded\n\n117\n00:05:49.886 --> 00:05:53.388\nfrom a third party like I did with mine\nhere, it's digitally signed by them.\n\n118\n00:05:53.388 --> 00:05:57.914\nThe point of the digital signature is\nthat if somebody modifies the application\n\n119\n00:05:57.914 --> 00:05:59.408\nthe signature will fail.\n\n120\n00:05:59.408 --> 00:06:02.470\nIt'll show that it's been modified,\nit might have malware in it, right?\n\n121\n00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.040\nAnd so, it's not gonna modify itself\ncuz it would invalidate its signature.\n\n122\n00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.620\nSo it's gotta store its settings,\nits preferences,\n\n123\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.590\nits other stuff,\nit's gotta store it at somewhere else.\n\n124\n00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.280\nWhere does it store it?\n\n125\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.100\nWell, there's two different types of\ndata that applications generate and\n\n126\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.310\nthere's four different places\nthat things can be stored.\n\n127\n00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.030\nSo, it gets a little bit frustrating.\n\n128\n00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.800\nFirst off, we have preferences.\n\n129\n00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.180\nWhen I go into a program like Cyberduck I\ncan jump into Cyberducks menu,\n\n130\n00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.830\nwhich actually let me get\nback to Cyberduck there.\n\n131\n00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.180\nI can go into Cyberducks menu and\nI can go to Preferences.\n\n132\n00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.940\nAnd in here, I will see the Preferences\nscreen with all the little settings that I\n\n133\n00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.630\ncan tweak based on what I wanted.\n\n134\n00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.650\nYou'll notice when I launched Cyberduck,\n\n135\n00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.060\nit already had me\nconnected to an FTP server.\n\n136\n00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.820\nBecause right here,\nI have it set to save my Workspace.\n\n137\n00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.720\nIt will save all open\nbrowsers when quitting and\n\n138\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.970\nrestore the connections upon relaunch.\n\n139\n00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.530\nSo that's what happened with that option,\nright?\n\n140\n00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.238\nWhen I was connected to this FTP site,\nso here I am logged in, maybe I'm\n\n141\n00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:05.195\ngonna browse in here to CentOS and\nI wanna get the latest version of CentOS.\n\n142\n00:07:05.195 --> 00:07:11.794\nSo I'm gonna find CentOS 6.7,\nI think, or 7.2.\n\n143\n00:07:11.794 --> 00:07:15.730\nThere we go, so I'm gonna browse in here\ncuz that's what I wanna download, right?\n\n144\n00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.613\nAnd then I quit the application, so\nI'll just quit out of Cyberduck and\n\n145\n00:07:19.613 --> 00:07:20.334\nthere we go.\n\n146\n00:07:20.334 --> 00:07:23.462\nNow, when I relaunch it,\nit's gonna come back up and\n\n147\n00:07:23.462 --> 00:07:26.323\nbecause the option was\nset to save my Workspace.\n\n148\n00:07:26.323 --> 00:07:29.274\nIt should take me right back in and\nit took a second but\n\n149\n00:07:29.274 --> 00:07:33.190\nhere we are, I'm connected and\nI'm in that CentOS folder, right?\n\n150\n00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.580\nBecause that Preference was set,\nif I go and change the Preference,\n\n151\n00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.010\nand I'll just turn that off.\n\n152\n00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.500\nSo Save Workspace, I'm gonna turn that\noff and now I'm gonna close that and\n\n153\n00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.950\nI'll close out at Cyberduck.\n\n154\n00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.213\nThis time, when I launch Cyberduck,\nit should not remember where I was.\n\n155\n00:07:49.213 --> 00:07:52.665\nIt could remember but it chooses not to,\nbecause I turned that option off, and\n\n156\n00:07:52.665 --> 00:07:55.717\nsure enough, I see my list of Bookmarks\nof services I can connect to.\n\n157\n00:07:55.717 --> 00:07:59.470\nSo that's a Preference,\nwell Where did it store that?\n\n158\n00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.200\nWhere did it store whether I\nhad that box checked or not?\n\n159\n00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.490\nWell one of two places.\n\n160\n00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.940\nWell this is really one of four,\n\n161\n00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.410\nbut there's two different\nways it can be stored.\n\n162\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.650\nMost applications will store\nthese as a preference.\n\n163\n00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.960\nThat's why we have the preferences screen.\n\n164\n00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.770\nSo it's normally gonna be stored\nwhere preferences are stored.\n\n165\n00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.610\nAnd by default your preferences\nend up one of two places.\n\n166\n00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:24.644\nThere's /library/preferences, that's\nwhere the system wide preferences are.\n\n167\n00:08:24.644 --> 00:08:29.980\nOr /users/your user\nname/library/preferences.\n\n168\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.360\nOne of those two.\n\n169\n00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.110\nAnd when it goes in there,\nit's a preference file and\n\n170\n00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.270\nit stores all those little boxes,\nis this checked, or not.\n\n171\n00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.460\nAnd it's a text file so it's going to say\nlike, a one or a zero, one if it's on,\n\n172\n00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.320\nzero if it's off and so on, but\nit stores it as a preference.\n\n173\n00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.340\nThat's how most of these\nare going to work.\n\n174\n00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.800\nSome applications don't do that though,\n\n175\n00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.140\nespecially applications that\nported from other OS's.\n\n176\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.030\nSo you might have an application that\nwas written in, written for Windows and\n\n177\n00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.210\nthen they ported it over to OS 10.\n\n178\n00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.390\nWell, Windows has this registry and\n\n179\n00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.880\nit's a completely different system then\nthe preference files inside of Mac OS.\n\n180\n00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.480\nThey're not compatible.\n\n181\n00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.120\nSo the vendor might say, you know what\nforget it, I'm not gonna do either one,\n\n182\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.390\nI gonna store it in my own file,\nI wanna do it my own way.\n\n183\n00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:11.170\nAnd if they do it their own way, they're\nnot allowed to put it in the preferences\n\n184\n00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.780\nfolder, they have to put it in what's\ncalled the application support folder.\n\n185\n00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.010\nAnd there's two of those also.\n\n186\n00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:21.370\nWe've got on our main system,\nthere's /library/application support.\n\n187\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:27.650\nOn your individual user, it's /user/your\nusername/library/application support.\n\n188\n00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.320\nSo one of those two places\nare where it's going to end up.\n\n189\n00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.490\nNow CyberDuck, I don't actually\nremember which one it does.\n\n190\n00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.210\nSo let's go and browse around and\nsee what we can find.\n\n191\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.800\nI'm gonna fire up my terminal.\n\n192\n00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.390\nAnd let's start with\nthe system wide stuff.\n\n193\n00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.390\nI\"m gonna browse into\n/Library/Preferences.\n\n194\n00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.890\nAnd when I get into that path,\nif I take a look at what's in there,\n\n195\n00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:53.330\nyou'll see there's a lot of files and\nit's a big long name .plist.\n\n196\n00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.080\nPlist is short for preference list.\n\n197\n00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.170\nThis is a list of your preference settings\nand what they're currently set at.\n\n198\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.880\nSo that's a plist file.\n\n199\n00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.930\nThe first part is suppose to be\nthe company that wrote the program,\n\n200\n00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.800\nfollowed by the program itself.\n\n201\n00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.230\nSo the one I just highlighted\nhere is noticeboard.apple.com.\n\n202\n00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.410\nIt's kinda written backwards.\n\n203\n00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.650\nSo apple.com, I can go to that website,\nthat's the company, and\n\n204\n00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.870\nthen noticeboard is the program.\n\n205\n00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.320\nAnd so you know, you should be able\nto find other programs in here too.\n\n206\n00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.340\nThere's the dock, right,\nremember I mentioned that dot,\n\n207\n00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.020\nthat it has that delay timer?\n\n208\n00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.940\nThe delay timer is stored right in\nthis file right here and I can go and\n\n209\n00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.670\nmodify that and now I'm changing\na setting that is not present in the GUI.\n\n210\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.480\nThe GUI settings are present here also.\n\n211\n00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.590\nEverything is present in the text file,\nbut not necessarily in the GUI.\n\n212\n00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:41.480\nBut what I'm looking for is CyberDuck,\nand I don't see CyberDuck in this list.\n\n213\n00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.810\nSo it doesn't have a system\nwide preferences setting.\n\n214\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.410\nLet's see if it has application support.\n\n215\n00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:53.230\nSo the directory I'm in right now\nis /Library/Application Support.\n\n216\n00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.824\nAnd this would be if they chose to store\ntheir settings not as a plist file.\n\n217\n00:10:57.915 --> 00:11:02.525\nA great example would be,\nwell maybe not so\n\n218\n00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:05.605\nmuch a business example, but\nlet's say you install the Steam client.\n\n219\n00:11:05.605 --> 00:11:08.945\nSo Steam, it's a video game\nmanagement solution platform,\n\n220\n00:11:08.945 --> 00:11:11.125\nwhatever you want to call it, storefront.\n\n221\n00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:14.595\nAnd it maintains a little Steam database,\nit tracks everything.\n\n222\n00:11:14.595 --> 00:11:16.445\nThe database is not a plist file.\n\n223\n00:11:16.445 --> 00:11:18.415\nAnd so the database goes\ninto application support.\n\n224\n00:11:18.415 --> 00:11:20.255\nThat's where it gets tucked\naway because it's different.\n\n225\n00:11:20.255 --> 00:11:22.030\nAnd you have a different kind of content.\n\n226\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.520\nSo when I look in here,\nI'm not seeing much at all, right?\n\n227\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.180\nWe've got iLifeMediaBrowser, ProApps,\nApple, App Store, VMware Tools, right.\n\n228\n00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.775\nSo here's the VMware Tools,\ntheir settings,\n\n229\n00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:34.450\nthey're being stored right in here.\n\n230\n00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.690\nSo these are some applications on the\nsystem life side, but still no CyberDuck.\n\n231\n00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.440\nWell, that's because CyberDuck is\nmaintaining separate settings for\n\n232\n00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.430\neach user.\n\n233\n00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.170\nI'm looking at the system line settings.\n\n234\n00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.730\nLets look at the user side.\n\n235\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.120\nIf i go into\n/users/dpezet/Library/Preferences,\n\n236\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:55.270\nwhen I get into that folder right there,\nI can\n\n237\n00:11:55.270 --> 00:12:01.080\npull up a listing and the first thing on\nthe list is a lot more stuff in here.\n\n238\n00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.790\nMost of your preferences are tracked\nper user so I expect to see a lot more.\n\n239\n00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.790\nAnd right here I can find CyberDuck.\n\n240\n00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.450\nNow, it looks like they're\nusing a fake company.\n\n241\n00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:16.720\nI can't imagine they have a sudo.ch,\nmaybe they do like the ch is China, right?\n\n242\n00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.552\n>> Yeah.\n\n243\n00:12:17.552 --> 00:12:19.018\n>> Sudo.china.\n\n244\n00:12:19.018 --> 00:12:21.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe I've installed a malware-laced\n\n245\n00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:22.990\nversion, I don't know.\n\n246\n00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.980\nBut usually it is the company name,\nI don't think it is in this case.\n\n247\n00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.100\nLet's find out, let's be adventurous here.\n\n248\n00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.020\nI'm gonna go to sudo.ch and\nsee what I get.\n\n249\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:37.158\nCuz the actual website for\nCyberDuck is CyberDuck.io, and\n\n250\n00:12:37.158 --> 00:12:39.600\nwhen I go here, yeah this is not it.\n\n251\n00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.440\nNow, just because it doesn't\nmatch doesn't necessarily\n\n252\n00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.290\nmean this is malware or whatever.\n\n253\n00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.970\nIt could be that whoever\nwrote the software just\n\n254\n00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.200\nhappens to have this on their website,\nthey're a developer.\n\n255\n00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.090\nSo companies have more than one identity,\nI don't actually know\n\n256\n00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.560\nthe history of CyberDuck, so\ni'm not sure if that's legitimate or not.\n\n257\n00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.920\nBut this could be a red flag for\nme or it could be legit.\n\n258\n00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.410\nBut either way,\nit is a preference file, so\n\n259\n00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.480\nright there I can see where CyberDuck\nis storing its preferences.\n\n260\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.902\nBut it might also have application\nsupport also, so if I take a look at\n\n261\n00:13:05.902 --> 00:13:11.730\n/users/deposits/libraries/application\nsupport,\n\n262\n00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.290\nand look around there I might\nsee CyberDuck in there, too.\n\n263\n00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:15.940\nI don't.\n\n264\n00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.470\nUsually it's applications that\nhave to store some kind of files,\n\n265\n00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.530\nlike the Steam database, and\nit would store it in there.\n\n266\n00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.740\nYour application might\nhave something similar.\n\n267\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.550\nBut with CyberDuck, if you think about it,\nit's an FTP client.\n\n268\n00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:30.160\nSo it just needs to maintain a list\nof the servers it can connect to, and\n\n269\n00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:30.800\nit stores those.\n\n270\n00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.355\nActually, it stores those\nin an address book.\n\n271\n00:13:32.355 --> 00:13:34.090\nYou'd think the address\nbook would be in here.\n\n272\n00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.100\nBut I certainly don't see it.\n\n273\n00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.580\nSo I'm not quite sure where\nit stores its address book.\n\n274\n00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.750\nBut the preferences, we saw that right\nhere inside of the preferences folder.\n\n275\n00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.050\nNow let's talk a little\nabout that plist file, okay?\n\n276\n00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.180\nIn older versions of Mac OS,\nit was just a text file.\n\n277\n00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.790\nAnd they are really XML.\n\n278\n00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.850\nSo their extensible markup language.\n\n279\n00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.690\nA text file with settings in it and\n\n280\n00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.030\nyou could open it up in text edit and\nread it to your heart's content.\n\n281\n00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.060\nWell, they're not like that anymore.\n\n282\n00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.320\nSo a few versions ago,\nApple introduced the new binary format for\n\n283\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.650\nthose preference files.\n\n284\n00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.840\nSo, I may be able to open this file.\n\n285\n00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.880\nI may not,\ndepending on what format it's in.\n\n286\n00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.110\nSo let's take a look at this one.\n\n287\n00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:18.570\nI'm gonna use VI, which is a text\neditor from the UNIX world.\n\n288\n00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.100\nNot user friendly by any means, but\n\n289\n00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.060\nI'm going to use it to open\nup this CyberDuck plist file.\n\n290\n00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.190\nAnd when I open it up, look at what I see.\n\n291\n00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:33.770\nWell looking at it right off the bat\nhere I've got this bplist and\n\n292\n00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:34.775\nblah, blah, blah right?\n\n293\n00:14:34.775 --> 00:14:37.290\nThat bplist is important.\n\n294\n00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.940\nWhat that's letting me know is\nthat this is a binary plist.\n\n295\n00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:41.860\nIt's not a text one.\n\n296\n00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.960\nThis isn't just a plain old text file.\n\n297\n00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.820\nThis is a binary.\n\n298\n00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.230\nAnd so\nI'm probably not gonna be able to read it.\n\n299\n00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.340\nAs I scroll down I'll see,\nthere's text, I can read the text, but\n\n300\n00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.450\nthere's these junk characters in between\nand everything's kind of a mess.\n\n301\n00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:01.430\nAnd as you continue to scroll down, you'll\nsee where it just gets weird, right?\n\n302\n00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.590\nAnd it's not intended to be read\nthe way that I'm reading it.\n\n303\n00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.950\nIt's messed up because it's a binary.\n\n304\n00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.645\nAnd so if I wanna work with these, I\nactually have to convert it back to a text\n\n305\n00:15:09.645 --> 00:15:13.595\nformat again, and then I can put it\nback into a binary when I'm done.\n\n306\n00:15:13.595 --> 00:15:17.725\nAnd Apple gives us a utility for that,\nit's the plutil, the preference list\n\n307\n00:15:17.725 --> 00:15:21.945\nutility, and if you run it, you'll\nsee it does a lot of different stuff.\n\n308\n00:15:21.945 --> 00:15:25.015\nBut the key thing that I use it for\nis just converting back and\n\n309\n00:15:25.015 --> 00:15:27.365\nforth between the text and binary formats.\n\n310\n00:15:27.365 --> 00:15:35.390\nSo I can come in here and\nI can say plutil -convert, XML one.\n\n311\n00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.350\nApple does XML one and binary one,\n\n312\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:42.280\nsaying this is the XML version one\ntext plist, or the binary version one.\n\n313\n00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.470\nBecause they might have a binary version\ntwo or an XML version two in the future.\n\n314\n00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.900\nThey don't yet, but that's what they have.\n\n315\n00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:52.614\nSo, I'll say convert XML one, and\nthen I'll point it to that file.\n\n316\n00:15:52.614 --> 00:15:58.297\nOkay, and when I run that it's gonna\nconvert it from a binary to a text file.\n\n317\n00:15:58.297 --> 00:16:04.920\nSo now, when I go and edit that file,\nnow I can see it's a straight up XML file.\n\n318\n00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.400\nThere's my XML header.\n\n319\n00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.510\nWe start to get into our table views.\n\n320\n00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:12.740\nAnd now it starts to lay out information\nin some kind of legible form.\n\n321\n00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.640\nNow I say legible.\n\n322\n00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.990\nIt looks like, unless I'm mistaken,\n\n323\n00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.960\nI think Cyberduck is\nencrypting its settings.\n\n324\n00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.510\nBecause if you look at-\n>> It's pretty garbled.\n\n325\n00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.880\n>> Yeah, all these settings are,\nI might have picked a bad example here.\n\n326\n00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.738\nI can see this is set to 270, but\nI don't know what this setting is because\n\n327\n00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:33.865\nit appears to be encrypted, I bet that's\nwindow position or something simple.\n\n328\n00:16:33.865 --> 00:16:37.802\nLet's see if we can find some things\nthat are a little more normal.\n\n329\n00:16:37.802 --> 00:16:40.070\nSome kind of table display mode.\n\n330\n00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.160\nThere's more window frame sizes.\n\n331\n00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.550\nSomewhere in here what I was hoping to do\nwas just immediately spot that setting\n\n332\n00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.190\nthat says, do I save the workspace or not?\n\n333\n00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.640\nIn fact, maybe we can just search for\nthe word space.\n\n334\n00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.950\nNah, of course not.\n\n335\n00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.610\nSo somewhere in here there\nwill be that setting, and\n\n336\n00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.090\nthe way the settings work you have\na key which defines what you're doing.\n\n337\n00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.990\nSo right here, queue.maxtransfers.\n\n338\n00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:06.860\nWhat's the maximum number of\ntransfers I can do, simultaneously?\n\n339\n00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.950\nAnd I can see the default is set to 2.\n\n340\n00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.850\nI can edit that and change it to\nanother number, and now it'll be 5, or\n\n341\n00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:13.510\n10, or whatever.\n\n342\n00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.400\nHere, I'll change it.\n\n343\n00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.792\nSo, I'm gonna take the maximum transfers\nfor the queue, bump it up to 20.\n\n344\n00:17:18.792 --> 00:17:20.209\nWell, that might be\na little too aggressive.\n\n345\n00:17:20.209 --> 00:17:21.215\nLet's go 9.\n\n346\n00:17:21.215 --> 00:17:22.350\n9's a nice weird number.\n\n347\n00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.260\nIt's an odd number.\n\n348\n00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.200\nI can choose that and put it and and\nwe'll be able to recognize that.\n\n349\n00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:31.310\nSo my max transfer, I'm just changing\nthat to 9, and then I'm going to save it.\n\n350\n00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:35.590\nNow if I leave it like it is,\nthe plist file still works.\n\n351\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.300\nBut your program is probably\nexpecting it to be a binary.\n\n352\n00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.570\nAnd I've converted it to XML.\n\n353\n00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.000\nSo I needed to put it back to a binary\nto get it back to the way that it was.\n\n354\n00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.440\nSo I'm gonna run that plutil command,\nexcept this time, I'm gonna say convert\n\n355\n00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.990\nbinary1 instead of saying xml1, okay?\n\n356\n00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:57.280\nAnd by doing that, it's gonna\nconvert it back to a binary, and so\n\n357\n00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.050\nif I go and edit it,\nnow it's back to a binary again.\n\n358\n00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.150\nAnd it's just jumbled up and\nmessed up, all right.\n\n359\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.790\nBut now when I run Cyberduck, Cyberduck\nis going to read that preference file.\n\n360\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.190\nIt's going to see the data\nthat's inside of it.\n\n361\n00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.540\nAnd once it does that,\nit's going to read its settings.\n\n362\n00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.010\nAnd so\nif I go into my Cyberduck preferences, and\n\n363\n00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.830\nwe find that max queue length.\n\n364\n00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.199\nRight, that will be in here somewhere.\n\n365\n00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.610\nLet's see.\n\n366\n00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:21.380\nWhere would that be?\n\n367\n00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.020\nSomewhere in here we'll find that setting,\nand it should be set to 9 now,\n\n368\n00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.480\nbecause that's what I changed it to.\n\n369\n00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.170\nAnd, I just have to find\nthe stinking setting.\n\n370\n00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.670\nYeah, I don't know where that setting is.\n\n371\n00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.100\nOr, this might have been a setting\nthat doesn't have a corresponding\n\n372\n00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.390\nGUI value, right?\n\n373\n00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.460\nThat some settings aren't\navailable in the GUI and\n\n374\n00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.910\ncan only be done from the preference file,\nand this may have been one of them cuz\n\n375\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.180\nI would expect it to be here\nunder Transfers, right?\n\n376\n00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.020\nSee how it's got,\nit allows multiple connections.\n\n377\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.180\nYou would expect it to let you limit\nthe amount of simultaneous queued items or\n\n378\n00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:51.990\nwhatever right here.\n\n379\n00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.040\nBut I'm not seeing that.\n\n380\n00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.100\nSo that may have been\na preference only change, and\n\n381\n00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.900\nyou'll bump into these from time to time.\n\n382\n00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.920\nThat's why it's important that we\nunderstand how those preference files work\n\n383\n00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.750\nand what they do.\n\n384\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.400\n>> So Don,\nI've watched you modify that file.\n\n385\n00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.530\nThat didn't seem too difficult.\n\n386\n00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.100\nYou had to know a little bit about using\nthe utility that's built in there to\n\n387\n00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.990\nconvert that, so\nthat you could change that setting.\n\n388\n00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:17.880\nBut anybody that wanted to could\neasily do that, and obviously,\n\n389\n00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.340\nif you start kicking\naround in preferences,\n\n390\n00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.645\nit's probably a really quick way\nto start really messing stuff up.\n\n391\n00:19:22.645 --> 00:19:23.280\n>> Yeah.\n\n392\n00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.982\n>> Is there anyway we can\nstop people from doing that?\n\n393\n00:19:25.982 --> 00:19:29.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> There is, and if it's the systemwide\n\n394\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.610\nsettings you have to be an admin to do it,\nright, so there's protection there.\n\n395\n00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.690\nFor the user settings though,\nit is up to you.\n\n396\n00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:36.310\nYou're the user.\n\n397\n00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.400\nYou can dink with your own settings and\nmess it up all you want.\n\n398\n00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.630\nIt's just gonna mess up your account.\n\n399\n00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.450\nSo there's not a whole\nlot of protection there.\n\n400\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:45.888\nBut I know one trick that some admins use,\nand some developers even use it,\n\n401\n00:19:45.888 --> 00:19:50.340\nis you can lock a file, even a preference\nfile, to not allow changes to it.\n\n402\n00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.700\nNow file locking Is an interesting thing.\n\n403\n00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.610\nI've used it in scripts and automation to\nmake sure that somebody couldn't modify\n\n404\n00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.340\na preference file when it was set\nexactly the way that I wanted it to.\n\n405\n00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.730\nIt will usually result in application\nerrors though if they try and\n\n406\n00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:01.340\nchange something.\n\n407\n00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.240\nBut, at least they know what happened.\n\n408\n00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.160\nLike, well, I tried to change that and\nI got an error as a result.\n\n409\n00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.700\nFile locking is supported in the GUI and\nthe command line.\n\n410\n00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.030\nLet me show you here.\n\n411\n00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.480\nSo I'm gonna go in my Finder, and\nI'm gonna go into My Documents.\n\n412\n00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.610\nAnd I have a very impressive\ndocument right here.\n\n413\n00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.090\nI know that because that's what\nit's called, Impressive Document.\n\n414\n00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:23.010\nAnd if I pull up its information,\nI can look at the document and\n\n415\n00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.080\nI can see information about it.\n\n416\n00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.670\nAnd right here, Locked.\n\n417\n00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.890\nYou can lock a file.\n\n418\n00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.790\nAnd when you lock it, see what happens?\n\n419\n00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.360\nSee how that little lock\nappeared on the icon?\n\n420\n00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.273\nIt's really little, this is gonna get\nsuper blurry, I'm gonna zoom in so much,\n\n421\n00:20:36.273 --> 00:20:38.273\nbut you can see that little\nlock right there in the icon.\n\n422\n00:20:38.273 --> 00:20:41.660\nThat it's now locked for changes.\n\n423\n00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.410\nSomebody could come along and\nthey could open it.\n\n424\n00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.620\nSo I'll just open up that\nimpressive document and\n\n425\n00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.470\nI'll make some kind of change to it.\n\n426\n00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.480\nI don't know.\n\n427\n00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.570\nLet's make some text red or something.\n\n428\n00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.810\nAnd.\n>> Did you\n\n429\n00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.294\nget in trouble with your teacher, Don?\n\n430\n00:20:55.294 --> 00:20:57.370\n>> [LAUGH] We're going to red line this.\n\n431\n00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.320\nWell, I can't.\n\n432\n00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.850\nI can't because the document is locked.\n\n433\n00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:03.810\nAnd it's asking if I want to unlock it or\nmake a duplicate of it, right?\n\n434\n00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.000\nSo I can unlock that file.\n\n435\n00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.870\nNow, from the GUI, this is pretty easy.\n\n436\n00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.340\nWe've got that lock option.\n\n437\n00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.290\nSo we can make that change\nfrom the Terminal, too.\n\n438\n00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.530\nI moved it here so I've got the little\nlock, it's showing on that icon right\n\n439\n00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:18.415\nup there and down here I've got my\nterminal and I can find that document.\n\n440\n00:21:18.415 --> 00:21:21.494\nSo there it is, Impressive Document,\nand I can lock and\n\n441\n00:21:21.494 --> 00:21:26.028\nunlock it from the command line, too, and\nI do that by doing the chflags command.\n\n442\n00:21:26.028 --> 00:21:27.584\nI'm going to change a file flag.\n\n443\n00:21:27.584 --> 00:21:32.072\nAnd the file flag that I want to\nchange is the user change flag and\n\n444\n00:21:32.072 --> 00:21:33.970\nI'm gonna say, nouchg.\n\n445\n00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.120\nI'm actually turning it off.\n\n446\n00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.160\nThe flag itself is uchg.\n\n447\n00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.620\nWhen I stick no before, that means turn it\noff, so I want to turn off that flag, and\n\n448\n00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.050\nthen I'll give it the name of that file.\n\n449\n00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.600\nAnd, as soon as I run it,\ndid you see that lock disappear, right?\n\n450\n00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.540\nI'd unlocked it, and\nnow it's able to be written to.\n\n451\n00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.030\nAnd then I can run that again, I'm just\ngoing to get rid of the word no, so\n\n452\n00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:58.810\nit'll be chflags, uchg, like that, and\nyou see the lock reappear again, right?\n\n453\n00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.420\nIt comes right back, and now it's locked.\n\n454\n00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.270\nSo we can lock and unlock these from\nthe command line programmatically,\n\n455\n00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.270\nyou can do it through the GUI if you want,\nbut\n\n456\n00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.880\nthis is a great way to flag it to\nstop people from modifying it.\n\n457\n00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.390\nNow, if they're an administrator\nthey can just unlock it and\n\n458\n00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:11.950\nit's not a big deal right?\n\n459\n00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.900\nSo it stops you from accidental changes\nbut somebody could still do it on purpose.\n\n460\n00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.740\nIf you're not an administrator,\nit's a different story, right?\n\n461\n00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.960\nYou can't unlock it.\n\n462\n00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.070\nWe can also achieve this\nwith file permissions.\n\n463\n00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:24.170\nI could just give somebody read\nonly permissions on the file.\n\n464\n00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.820\nThat gets a little bit hard\nwith preferences, where they're\n\n465\n00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.840\ntucked away in the system side and we\nare not supposed to mess with them, right?\n\n466\n00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.200\nBut with other files we can\ndo this pretty readily.\n\n467\n00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.092\n>> Yeah Don, I can see this\nactually coming in handy as,\n\n468\n00:22:35.092 --> 00:22:39.144\non the administrative side, maybe we\nwant our users set up ubiquitously,\n\n469\n00:22:39.144 --> 00:22:41.776\nwe want everybody to\nhave the same settings.\n\n470\n00:22:41.776 --> 00:22:43.000\nAnd then you've got that user that goes,\n\n471\n00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.490\nwell it's in my user preferences,\nI can make that change, and they do.\n\n472\n00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.720\nWe don't want that, so\nwe would probably go in there and\n\n473\n00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.270\nset that so we can lock that file,\nkeep them from making those changes.\n\n474\n00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:57.330\nThat way if I have to support them, I know\nexactly how that system is gonna be set up\n\n475\n00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:02.105\nand it should be that way, that'd be\nthe most benefit I could find from it.\n\n476\n00:23:02.105 --> 00:23:02.865\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n477\n00:23:02.865 --> 00:23:03.565\n>> By the way Don.\n\n478\n00:23:03.565 --> 00:23:08.465\nI did check out the sudo.ch and\n\n479\n00:23:08.465 --> 00:23:13.810\nit looks to be, the guy that runs\nthat site is a part of Cyberduck,\n\n480\n00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.450\nmaybe he's one of\nthe authors of Cyberduck.\n\n481\n00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:16.620\nThere's definitely a correlation.\n\n482\n00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.340\n>> Okay, all right.\n>> There's a link to Cyberduck.\n\n483\n00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:18.890\n>> That was legit.\n\n484\n00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:19.860\n>> That was legit.\n\n485\n00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.900\n>> I didn't download malware.\n\n486\n00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.090\n>> No, not yet.\n\n487\n00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.140\n>> All right, well, we've talked about\nsome of the preferences for applications,\n\n488\n00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.830\nbut remember that OS X\nhas preferences also.\n\n489\n00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.790\nIt tracks a lot of things,\nas far as who's allowed to open what.\n\n490\n00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:36.490\nAnd some of the preferences are stored\nin preferences files, just like we saw.\n\n491\n00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.695\nLike the doc has its own plist file.\n\n492\n00:23:38.695 --> 00:23:42.395\nBut there's other things that are stored\nand registered with the system as a whole,\n\n493\n00:23:42.395 --> 00:23:44.687\nthat are a little more core\nto the operating system,\n\n494\n00:23:44.687 --> 00:23:46.217\nand they don't have plist files.\n\n495\n00:23:46.217 --> 00:23:49.289\nAnd one example is something that I\nknow we talked about in another episode,\n\n496\n00:23:49.289 --> 00:23:50.490\nwe talked about extensions.\n\n497\n00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.030\nAnd how every file has a file extension,\nlike this impressive document.\n\n498\n00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:58.490\nIf we look at my terminal,\nit's Impressive\\Document.rtf.\n\n499\n00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.680\nThat rtf lets me know it's\na rich text file, right?\n\n500\n00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.610\nSo when you open it up, or\nrich text format, and we can open it up,\n\n501\n00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.800\nwe can look at it and\neverything looks nice and pretty, right?\n\n502\n00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.250\nSo if I open this thing up, here it is.\n\n503\n00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.800\nIt knew to open it in TextEdit, right?\n\n504\n00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:16.492\nIt knew that TextEdit could read an rtf\nfile like this, and here it is and\n\n505\n00:24:16.492 --> 00:24:17.670\nI can see it.\n\n506\n00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.740\nNow, how did it know that\nTextEdit could open that?\n\n507\n00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:21.910\n>> It's a brilliant genius.\n\n508\n00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:23.360\n>> Well, I suppose there's that.\n\n509\n00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.904\nBut OS X is also keeping track of what\napplications can open what documents,\n\n510\n00:24:27.904 --> 00:24:29.466\nit keeps a record of that.\n\n511\n00:24:29.466 --> 00:24:33.560\nAnd you can see that when you\nCtrl+click on a file like this one and\n\n512\n00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.826\nyou go to Open With,\n\n513\n00:24:34.826 --> 00:24:39.920\nit'll give you a list of the programs\nyou have installed that can open that.\n\n514\n00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.175\nI've only got one,\nI've got TextEdit and that's it.\n\n515\n00:24:42.175 --> 00:24:44.384\nBut you might have other\napplications installed,\n\n516\n00:24:44.384 --> 00:24:48.120\nthey'd all be right here in the list\nof programs that are able to open it.\n\n517\n00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.900\nWhen you install an application,\nit has to tell OS X hey,\n\n518\n00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.590\nI can open all these different files.\n\n519\n00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.710\nAnd then OS X keeps a record of that and\nstores it.\n\n520\n00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:58.580\nSo that's part of the way\nthat it's tracking that.\n\n521\n00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.632\nAnd it's actually storing\nthat information,\n\n522\n00:25:00.632 --> 00:25:02.125\nlet me show you where it stores it.\n\n523\n00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:05.672\nThe main one for\nthe system is stored in Library and\n\n524\n00:25:05.672 --> 00:25:10.600\nit's under Preferences, and\nit's in one of the com.apple files.\n\n525\n00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:16.820\nIt's under LaunchServices,\nwhich apparently, I don't have.\n\n526\n00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.363\nWhen a program is able to open a file,\nthey call it a LaunchService.\n\n527\n00:25:19.363 --> 00:25:21.820\nYou can launch that file\nup in this application.\n\n528\n00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.451\nSo applications have to register\nas a LaunchService and apparently,\n\n529\n00:25:25.451 --> 00:25:28.167\nhow is this possible that\nI don't have a system one?\n\n530\n00:25:28.167 --> 00:25:29.970\nSeems like you'd have to have one.\n\n531\n00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:33.010\nLet me see if I can you know what?\n\n532\n00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.518\nI'm doing cd to change directory, and\n\n533\n00:25:35.518 --> 00:25:39.171\nI'm specifying a non-directory\nis what my problem is.\n\n534\n00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:45.040\nLet me just come in here, and\nbasically what we're looking for\n\n535\n00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.150\nis com.apple.launchservices.plist.\n\n536\n00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.356\nAnd I don't have one,\nI guess maybe I haven't installed.\n\n537\n00:25:52.356 --> 00:25:54.676\nThe only third party software\nI installed was Cyberduck, and\n\n538\n00:25:54.676 --> 00:25:56.780\nCyberduck doesn't have any\nfile types attached to it.\n\n539\n00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.712\nSo I guess I just don't have any so\nit hasn't registered any new ones yet.\n\n540\n00:26:00.712 --> 00:26:02.770\nLet me see if I've got\none on my own desktop.\n\n541\n00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.310\nSo here's my desktop and I've got,\n\n542\n00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:08.160\nGod only knows how many programs\ninstalled on this thing.\n\n543\n00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.220\nAnd so if we go and\ntake a look at this one.\n\n544\n00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.605\nLet me get into that folder and\nwe'll look for\n\n545\n00:26:15.605 --> 00:26:19.202\ncom.apple.launch services in,\nyou know what?\n\n546\n00:26:19.202 --> 00:26:21.080\nI don't have one here either, right?\n\n547\n00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.110\nSo at the system side, I don't have one.\n\n548\n00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.952\nWell, if I don't have one,\n\n549\n00:26:23.952 --> 00:26:27.280\nhow does it know what programs\nto use to launch things?\n\n550\n00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.412\nWell, there's a second one\nthat's stored for the user too.\n\n551\n00:26:30.412 --> 00:26:34.478\nSo you've got, much like everything else\nwe've seen, you've got a system one and\n\n552\n00:26:34.478 --> 00:26:35.630\nyou've got a user one.\n\n553\n00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.219\nSo let's go see if I have a user one.\n\n554\n00:26:37.219 --> 00:26:41.060\nI will be absolutely shocked\nif I don't have a user one.\n\n555\n00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:46.280\nSo let's just jump into my Library and\nmy Preferences.\n\n556\n00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:53.233\nAnd what I'm looking for\nin here is com.apple.launchservices.\n\n557\n00:26:53.233 --> 00:27:00.850\nSo let's see if we can find it,\ncom.apple.launchservices.\n\n558\n00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.483\nWhoa, well, Daniel I guess I\nget to be absolutely shocked,\n\n559\n00:27:03.483 --> 00:27:04.630\nbecause I do not have one.\n\n560\n00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:09.768\nAnd I'm not sure where that file is,\nand actually I do know.\n\n561\n00:27:09.768 --> 00:27:11.145\nI'm forgetting something\nkind of important.\n\n562\n00:27:11.145 --> 00:27:15.410\nIf I would go back and watch my own show\nsometimes, then I'd remember these things.\n\n563\n00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.840\nBut you guys might remember,\nin some of the earlier episodes of ACSP,\n\n564\n00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.870\nI mentioned something called\napplication sandboxing.\n\n565\n00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.900\nThat when you run an application,\n\n566\n00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:28.490\nMac OS is kind of isolating it into its\nown little bubble, its own little world.\n\n567\n00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:31.889\nWell, think about what that\nlaunch services file would do.\n\n568\n00:27:31.889 --> 00:27:35.467\nThe launch services file says,\nhere's these extensions and\n\n569\n00:27:35.467 --> 00:27:40.020\nif I wanna fire open a RTF file,\nhere's this application that can do it.\n\n570\n00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:44.220\nWhat if malware gets installed and\nthe malware says I can open RTF files.\n\n571\n00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.120\nAnd now when you open it up it\nfeeds it over to the malware and\n\n572\n00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.210\nthe malware sends it off\nto some third party, right?\n\n573\n00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.870\nWe don't want that to happen.\n\n574\n00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:54.815\nAnd so as part of the sandboxing, Apple\ndoesn't let them access a centralized\n\n575\n00:27:54.815 --> 00:27:56.806\nlaunch service file anymore, right?\n\n576\n00:27:56.806 --> 00:27:59.020\nIt doesn't let them register\nthemselves that way.\n\n577\n00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.680\nSo instead, they register with a fake\n\n578\n00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.680\nlaunch services file that's maintained\njust for them, just for their application.\n\n579\n00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.558\nAnd then OS X goes and\n\n580\n00:28:06.558 --> 00:28:10.033\nharvests all that together to assemble\nthe real list that's actually in play.\n\n581\n00:28:10.033 --> 00:28:11.041\n>> Sneaky [LAUGH].\n\n582\n00:28:11.041 --> 00:28:13.505\n>> I know it's tricky, we just have\nto remember that's happening, and\n\n583\n00:28:13.505 --> 00:28:14.310\nI completely forgot.\n\n584\n00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:16.858\nSo I'm looking in\nthe centralized location,\n\n585\n00:28:16.858 --> 00:28:19.750\nI expected to see that\nlaunch services file.\n\n586\n00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.750\nAnd if I were in an older version of\nMac OS then yes, I'd see that, right?\n\n587\n00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:28.730\nBut if I'm in Yosemite or El Capitan,\nI'm in El Capitan here, I don't have it.\n\n588\n00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.950\nSo where the heck are these files?\n\n589\n00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:31.801\nThey're in the sandbox.\n\n590\n00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:32.911\nLet me show where that sandbox is,\n\n591\n00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:35.610\ncuz I don't think I've actually\nshown you guys here on the show yet.\n\n592\n00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.680\nSo here, I am on my laptop.\n\n593\n00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.323\nAnd I'm gonna browse into\nmy own users directory.\n\n594\n00:28:41.323 --> 00:28:44.390\nIf you ever just type cd and press Enter,\nit'll just change into your own directory.\n\n595\n00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.190\nSo I'm in /Users/donpezet.\n\n596\n00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:50.007\nAnd from here,\nI'm gonna get into my Library.\n\n597\n00:28:50.007 --> 00:28:52.480\nAnd a moment ago I was going\ninto my Preferences folder,\n\n598\n00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.650\ncuz that's where I expected\nto find this launch control.\n\n599\n00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.710\nBut this time I'm gonna go\ninto a different folder.\n\n600\n00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:01.130\nThere's a folder in\nhere called Containers.\n\n601\n00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.690\nAnd those containers, those are the jails,\nthe little sandboxes for\n\n602\n00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:05.910\nyour applications.\n\n603\n00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:09.780\nAnd so when I go into Containers,\nI'm gonna see a container for\n\n604\n00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.160\neach of the programs\nthat I've got installed.\n\n605\n00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.619\nThe Apple programs,\nas well as third parties.\n\n606\n00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:17.504\nAnd so we can see like here\nMicrosoft Word, we'll take that one.\n\n607\n00:29:17.504 --> 00:29:21.430\nSo Microsoft Word has its own container.\n\n608\n00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.872\nMicrosoft Word can open RTF files, right?\n\n609\n00:29:23.872 --> 00:29:26.400\nIt can open up DOC files,\nit can open up all sorts of things.\n\n610\n00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.226\nAnd so\nit's gonna have that registered in there.\n\n611\n00:29:28.226 --> 00:29:33.530\nSo let me get into com.microsoft.Word/.\n\n612\n00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:38.430\nAnd inside of there, I see my\ncontainer preferences and then Data.\n\n613\n00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:42.960\nAnd if I get into Data,\nnow I see Desktop, Documents, Downloads,\n\n614\n00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.580\nLibraries, Movies, Music,\nPictures, I see my user profile.\n\n615\n00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.330\nIs it my user profile?\n\n616\n00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:52.717\nWell, if I do an ls -la it is, all of\nthese are pointers, they're pointers,\n\n617\n00:29:52.717 --> 00:29:56.246\nthe Documents folder that points\nto my real Documents folder.\n\n618\n00:29:56.246 --> 00:29:58.940\nMy Desktop that points to my real Desktop.\n\n619\n00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.920\nThese are all links,\nsymbolic links on the hard drive.\n\n620\n00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:07.400\nSo I know it's a symbolic link cuz it's\ngot a little l over here on the side.\n\n621\n00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.690\nVersus like a hard link, that would have\na dash, so these are symbolic links.\n\n622\n00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:14.520\nAnd they're pointing to ../../,\nit's basically going up,\n\n623\n00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.640\nup, up,\nfour tiers to get to my real Desktop.\n\n624\n00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:22.545\nBut when Word goes to write to my Desktop,\nit doesn't go right to the real Desktop.\n\n625\n00:30:22.545 --> 00:30:24.160\nIt goes here to this link first.\n\n626\n00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.293\nAnd that way, if the operating system ever\nwants to, the operating system can yank\n\n627\n00:30:27.293 --> 00:30:29.440\nWord's access to the Desktop\nat a moment's notice.\n\n628\n00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.610\nAnd it could say nope, you don't\nhave access to the Desktop anymore.\n\n629\n00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:34.837\nPulls this link and it's gone,\nWord is stuck in this container, right?\n\n630\n00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.745\nBut the one that's important\nto me is Library, and\n\n631\n00:30:38.745 --> 00:30:40.996\nnotice that Library is not a link, is it?\n\n632\n00:30:40.996 --> 00:30:44.230\nWord has its own Library folder.\n\n633\n00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:47.610\nAnd if I change into that Library folder,\nand\n\n634\n00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:52.780\npoke around in there, I'll see that\nit's got its own Preferences folder.\n\n635\n00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.770\nAnd if I go into it's very\nown Preferences folder and\n\n636\n00:30:55.770 --> 00:31:00.470\npull up a listing,\nthere is a ton of stuff in here, right?\n\n637\n00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:02.495\nIt's not as big as my real\nPreferences folder, but\n\n638\n00:31:02.495 --> 00:31:03.774\nit's got a lot of stuff in here.\n\n639\n00:31:03.774 --> 00:31:06.680\nThis is everything that Word\nhas ever tried to modify.\n\n640\n00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.880\nSo you see Words own Preference file,\nof course, it's gonna try and modify that.\n\n641\n00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.741\nBut I'll also see some other things in\nhere like [LAUGH] I couldn't see it for\n\n642\n00:31:15.741 --> 00:31:17.064\na moment, Daniel.\n\n643\n00:31:17.064 --> 00:31:19.200\nI thought it wasn't gonna be there,\nI was about to freak out.\n\n644\n00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.550\nBut there it is,\nthat's the file I've been looking for\n\n645\n00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:24.730\nthis whole time,\ncom.apple.LaunchServices.plist.\n\n646\n00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:30.431\nThat's where Microsoft Word is saying\nI can open up .doc, .docx, .pdf, .rtf,\n\n647\n00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:35.851\n.txt, all the different files that Word\ncan open, it's putting them right there.\n\n648\n00:31:35.851 --> 00:31:38.902\nAnd then what MacOS is gonna do is\ntake that and aggregate it together\n\n649\n00:31:38.902 --> 00:31:43.020\nwith all the other applications to build\nthe final list that's actually being used.\n\n650\n00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.090\nSo that's where that stuff\nis being registered.\n\n651\n00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:48.268\nNow if we know about where the physical\nfile is that's great obviously,\n\n652\n00:31:48.268 --> 00:31:49.842\nit's littered all over the place.\n\n653\n00:31:49.842 --> 00:31:51.410\nI say, it's littered all over the place.\n\n654\n00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:52.518\nThere are tons of these files.\n\n655\n00:31:52.518 --> 00:31:56.280\nLet me show you, let me get out of Word.\n\n656\n00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.790\nAnd so\nhere I am just in my Containers folder.\n\n657\n00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:03.960\nAnd I'm gonna do a Find on this directory,\nand I'm gonna look for\n\n658\n00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:12.360\nany one that is\ncom.apple.LaunchServices.plist.\n\n659\n00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.159\nSo I'm looking for that and you'll see\nthat I've got a ton of them, right?\n\n660\n00:32:16.159 --> 00:32:18.505\nAnd these are all the different\napplications I've installed on my laptop.\n\n661\n00:32:18.505 --> 00:32:23.300\nThere's Apple ones,\nI've got Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word,\n\n662\n00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:28.460\nPowerPoint, Pixelmator, Twitter,\nvarious applications that I've installed.\n\n663\n00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.205\nEach one maintaining their\nown LaunchServices.plist.\n\n664\n00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:33.242\nSo for an end user, obviously,\n\n665\n00:32:33.242 --> 00:32:35.130\nI don't wanna go and\nmess with all these individual files.\n\n666\n00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:38.269\nIf we wanna change what a default is for\nopening,\n\n667\n00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:41.630\nall we do is we come in and\nwe take the file.\n\n668\n00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:45.560\nAnd you can always Ctrl+click on it and\ndo an Open With.\n\n669\n00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.910\nBut if you do a Get Info,\nyou can set the default.\n\n670\n00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:52.930\nAnd when come in here and take a look\nat that default, it will be right here.\n\n671\n00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.940\nOpen With, and\nsee how it's defaulting to TextEdit?\n\n672\n00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.208\nAnd I can drop that and\nchange it to others.\n\n673\n00:32:57.208 --> 00:33:00.412\nAnd I can change it just for\nthis document, or I can change it for\n\n674\n00:33:00.412 --> 00:33:02.180\nevery document of that same type.\n\n675\n00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.363\nI've got that control and\nthat access all right there.\n\n676\n00:33:04.363 --> 00:33:06.900\nI don't have to worry about\nthe plist files behind the scene.\n\n677\n00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.140\nBut they are back there,\nthey are existing,\n\n678\n00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.600\nthey're just in those containers, in those\nlittle sandboxes, for each application.\n\n679\n00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.375\n>> Wow, there definitely is\na whole lot of knob twisting and\n\n680\n00:33:15.375 --> 00:33:19.130\ndial turning going on behind the scenes,\nunder the Mac OS X hood.\n\n681\n00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.820\nAnd we got a little taste of that today.\n\n682\n00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.422\nDon, I know there's a lot more\nthat we need to talk about, or\n\n683\n00:33:24.422 --> 00:33:27.088\nsome really cool features when\nit comes to application data.\n\n684\n00:33:27.088 --> 00:33:31.140\nBut I'm looking at the clock man, and you\nhave yammered on like a crazy person for\n\n685\n00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.521\nthe last, easy half hour.\n\n686\n00:33:32.521 --> 00:33:34.255\n>> Yeah, yeah, we went a little long.\n\n687\n00:33:34.255 --> 00:33:36.145\nI do have some odds and\nends that I wanna tackle though.\n\n688\n00:33:36.145 --> 00:33:38.423\nOther types of data that get stored for\napplications,\n\n689\n00:33:38.423 --> 00:33:40.200\nwe definitely need to see that.\n\n690\n00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.750\nSo stay tuned for part two.\n\n691\n00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.916\n>> That will be in our future.\n\n692\n00:33:42.916 --> 00:33:44.360\nHopefully, you will be there as well.\n\n693\n00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.400\nDon, thanks for stopping by,\nwe'll look forward to seeing you there.\n\n694\n00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.418\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n695\n00:33:49.418 --> 00:33:50.780\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n696\n00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.552\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n697\n00:33:51.552 --> 00:33:53.535\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n698\n00:33:53.535 --> 00:34:01.310\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:17.849\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.429\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe already continued forward with our\n\n5\n00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.700\nApple Certified Support Professional\nseries.\n\n6\n00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.750\nJoining us back in the studio today, for\na little more part two on application data\n\n7\n00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.460\nis none other than our\ngood friend Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.870\nDon, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n9\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.470\nHow are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.600\n>> Thanks for having me back Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.970\nReady to jump right back in and\ntalk about some of our app data.\n\n12\n00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.895\nAnd in the last episode we focused\non things like preferences,\n\n13\n00:00:37.895 --> 00:00:39.673\nwhich we could find them right there.\n\n14\n00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.722\nWell after a while, we could find\nthem right there on the hard drive.\n\n15\n00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:44.720\nThose plist files sitting there with\nall the data tucked away in them.\n\n16\n00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.200\nSometimes things are really,\n\n17\n00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.140\nreally obvious like that,\nsimilar to the documents themselves.\n\n18\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.260\nSo if you have a word processor or\na spreadsheet program or whatever,\n\n19\n00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.940\nthe data that it generates just goes right\ninto your documents folder by default.\n\n20\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.010\nReally visible, really easy to see.\n\n21\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.610\nBut there are sometimes where\nthe data that an application creates\n\n22\n00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.600\nIs mysteriously hidden away in\nwhat would seem like nothing.\n\n23\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.460\nAnd there's some neat features that\nare put inside of OS X that can\n\n24\n00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.050\ntake advantage of that, they can use that\ndata to really pull up some good stuff.\n\n25\n00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.163\nSo that's what we're gonna take a look at.\n\n26\n00:01:18.163 --> 00:01:21.232\nI've got quick look on the list and\nautosave are two of the big features that\n\n27\n00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:23.890\nI didn't get to in the last\nepisode that we need to see.\n\n28\n00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.150\nThey show up on the exam but\nthey show up in real life too,\n\n29\n00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.710\nbecause they're neat features and\nthey're definitely useful.\n\n30\n00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.705\nSo let's kick things on QuickLook.\n\n31\n00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:34.165\nQuickLook is one of those features that\nwas introduced in Mac OS just a few\n\n32\n00:01:34.165 --> 00:01:34.914\nversions ago.\n\n33\n00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:39.783\nAnd it's a really neat system that builds\non the idea of the launch services\n\n34\n00:01:39.783 --> 00:01:41.680\nwe saw in the last episode.\n\n35\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.790\nSo well launch services if you don't\nremember, if I install a word processor.\n\n36\n00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.720\nAnd it can read PDFs and documents and\nso on, like Word documents,\n\n37\n00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.760\nit registers itself with Mac OS\nto say hey, I can open that.\n\n38\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.263\nAnd so when Mac OS comes\nacross one of these files,\n\n39\n00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:01.253\nyou can double-click on it in\nnose hook program to open it.\n\n40\n00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:03.430\nSo it's registered that extension.\n\n41\n00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.300\nWell applications where the developers\nhave really put some effort in\n\n42\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.868\ncan register it with QuickLook also.\n\n43\n00:02:09.868 --> 00:02:13.510\nAnd what QuickLook does is\nit lets you see information\n\n44\n00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.450\nabout the file without even opening it.\n\n45\n00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.037\nSo for example, here on my desktop,\nlet me just browse here.\n\n46\n00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:23.030\nI'm gonna browse into my Documents folder.\n\n47\n00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.300\nAnd or actually,\n\n48\n00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.840\nI'll go to all Documents cuz let's see,\nI've got a few different things here.\n\n49\n00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.640\nI've got three different documents,\ntwo of them are RTFs.\n\n50\n00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.714\nThey're Rich Text Format files,\nand one of them is a PDF.\n\n51\n00:02:35.714 --> 00:02:38.710\nSo an Adobe Portable Document Format.\n\n52\n00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.870\nAnd when you look at them,\nI'm not just seeing generic file icons.\n\n53\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.130\nWhat I'm seeing on the RTFs\nis actually a miniature\n\n54\n00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.400\nthumbnail preview of what's\ninside of that file.\n\n55\n00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.480\nSo it's showing it and\nI know it just looks kind of generic, but\n\n56\n00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.190\nthat's because of what I put in there.\n\n57\n00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.310\nWhat I put in there is generic.\n\n58\n00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.624\nLet's make it a little less generic.\n\n59\n00:03:00.624 --> 00:03:04.250\nSo maybe if I take the first three lines,\nand I'll make them red.\n\n60\n00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.950\nAnd I'll take a few more lines down here,\nand maybe I'll make them blue.\n\n61\n00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.240\nSo I'm just adding a little character\nto my file, so now it kinda stands out.\n\n62\n00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.790\nA little patriotic red white and\nblue or if you're French,\n\n63\n00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.970\nyou can go backwards on it,\nblue white red.\n\n64\n00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:20.978\nThey'd say, ours is backwards.\n\n65\n00:03:20.978 --> 00:03:22.311\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I do that,\n\n66\n00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:26.710\nnow when I look at the thumbnail, see\nhow it's showing that, the red and blue?\n\n67\n00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.200\nThis is an actual preview\nof the file itself.\n\n68\n00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.760\nI haven't even opened the darned thing and\nit's showing me what it looks like.\n\n69\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.170\nHere's a PDF that I would\nnormally open in Adobe Acrobat or\n\n70\n00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.240\nthe preview client here inside of\nMac OS or something like that.\n\n71\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.520\nAnd I can see there's the little X logo\nthat's on the first page of that document.\n\n72\n00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.880\nIf I open it up, and I go in here and\n\n73\n00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.490\nlook at the first page of\nthe document what do I see?\n\n74\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.650\nThere it is, there's that big X.\n\n75\n00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.306\nIt's a preview of the document itself.\n\n76\n00:03:57.306 --> 00:04:01.768\nSo what it's effectively doing is\nopening the document to generate\n\n77\n00:04:01.768 --> 00:04:06.230\nthe thumbnail without actually\nrunning the program itself.\n\n78\n00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.300\nHow the heck does it do that?\n\n79\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.238\nWell it's all done through\nthe QuickLook service.\n\n80\n00:04:11.238 --> 00:04:12.370\nAnd the QuickLook service,\n\n81\n00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.850\nis a collection of libraries that tell\nit how to generate these thumbnails.\n\n82\n00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.170\nSo I don't need all of Microsoft Word,\nI don't need all of Adobe Acrobat\n\n83\n00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.040\njust to generate a quick\nthumbnail of the first page.\n\n84\n00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.874\nAnd so Adobe and Microsoft or whoever have\nreleased little libraries that Apple can\n\n85\n00:04:29.874 --> 00:04:31.955\nuse to generate these thumbnails.\n\n86\n00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:34.024\nThere's some of them Apple wrote\nit themselves, the PDFOne,\n\n87\n00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.390\nApple wrote it themselves.\n\n88\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.280\nThe Word one, Microsoft provided that.\n\n89\n00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.700\nAnd so we're now able to see that and\nit looks kinda pretty.\n\n90\n00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.400\nAnd that little thumbnail,\nit shows up in more than one place.\n\n91\n00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.530\nSo for example, if I do the Get Info\nscreen, when I do the Get Info,\n\n92\n00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.690\nsee that's the generic icon that we'd\nsee if we didn't have QuickLook.\n\n93\n00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.410\nBit if I look down here, I get a Preview.\n\n94\n00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.680\nHere's a preview of that document\nright here in my Get Info screen.\n\n95\n00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.830\nAnd because it's just an RTF, it actually\nloads the first handful of lines.\n\n96\n00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.330\nAnd I can get that preview of the data\nright here in the Get Info screen.\n\n97\n00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.862\nI haven't launched TextEdit, but\nI'm seeing it here in the Preview.\n\n98\n00:05:14.862 --> 00:05:17.520\nLet's see if that PDF\nwill do the same thing.\n\n99\n00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.210\nSure enough, in the Preview for\nthe PDF I see the entire first page.\n\n100\n00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.200\nAnd I've even got little\nnavigation buttons right here.\n\n101\n00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.642\nSo I can sit and start to read.\n\n102\n00:05:26.642 --> 00:05:28.173\nAnd if you're crazy you can sit here and\n\n103\n00:05:28.173 --> 00:05:30.274\nread the whole sticking thing\nin the Get Info screen.\n\n104\n00:05:30.274 --> 00:05:31.980\n>> Well Don,\nthis is a really cool feature.\n\n105\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.280\nWe can actually get an idea of what it is\nwe're gonna look at before we even ever\n\n106\n00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.215\nopen the thing.\n\n107\n00:05:37.215 --> 00:05:41.790\nDoes this work with every file\nthat you throw on a Mac system?\n\n108\n00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.193\n>> Not every one.\n\n109\n00:05:43.193 --> 00:05:45.044\nIt works with a lot of them.\n\n110\n00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:48.481\nWhen Apple ships OS X, they package in\nsome QuickLook libraries to be able to\n\n111\n00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:50.680\nreference, to be able to pull these up.\n\n112\n00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.770\nSome are built in to the system, but\n\n113\n00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.670\nthen there are others you may\nneed to install by yourself.\n\n114\n00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.760\nAs you install applications\nyou'll find that it grows.\n\n115\n00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.943\nSo this is a stock install of OS X,\nit's not very exciting.\n\n116\n00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:03.130\nLet me jump over to my own desktop.\n\n117\n00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.866\nAnd on my desktop,\nI've got El Capitan installed, but\n\n118\n00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:10.373\nI've obviously installed\na ton of other software.\n\n119\n00:06:10.373 --> 00:06:13.982\nAnd as I've installed that software,\nit's added more and more and\n\n120\n00:06:13.982 --> 00:06:18.493\nmore of those little QuickLook libraries\nto increase what's able to be previewed.\n\n121\n00:06:18.493 --> 00:06:22.360\nIf you wanna see what\nones you have installed,\n\n122\n00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.140\nif you take a look in /library/QuickLook.\n\n123\n00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.961\nSo the path is /Library/QuickLook,\nand just pull up a listing in there.\n\n124\n00:06:30.961 --> 00:06:33.970\nAnd you'll get a listing of all\nthe things you can do with QuickLook for.\n\n125\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.980\nI've got a massive list here.\n\n126\n00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.193\nI work in iBooks.\n\n127\n00:06:37.193 --> 00:06:38.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not very spectacular.\n\n128\n00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.235\nWell this isn't the only place\nthat QuickLook things can go.\n\n129\n00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:43.613\nThis is the main one, /Library/QuickLook.\n\n130\n00:06:43.613 --> 00:06:47.150\nSome of the other places,\nthe ones that are built into Mac OS.\n\n131\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.286\nThey're tucked away in\n/System/Library/QuickLook.\n\n132\n00:06:52.286 --> 00:06:54.650\nAnd so I go over there,\nhere's the system ones.\n\n133\n00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.070\nThe ones that are built in.\n\n134\n00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:02.800\nSo I'll see Audio, Contact, APS,\nthat's a printing format, PDF.\n\n135\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.280\nSo that's the PDFOne that we saw menu.\n\n136\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.532\nI don't have Acrobat installed on\nthat other machine, mail movie notes.\n\n137\n00:07:08.532 --> 00:07:10.051\nWell, I guess we have two PDFOnes.\n\n138\n00:07:10.051 --> 00:07:12.770\nWell I'm not quite sure what\nthe difference is between those two.\n\n139\n00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.436\nEven a Microsoft Office QuickLook\ngenerator is installed.\n\n140\n00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.743\nSo each of these are ones that\nare gonna work for these file formats.\n\n141\n00:07:19.743 --> 00:07:21.865\n>> I wonder who's winning\nbetween the two PDF readers?\n\n142\n00:07:21.865 --> 00:07:24.463\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, I imagine if you install\n\n143\n00:07:24.463 --> 00:07:26.597\nthe Adobe one than that would win-\n>> Yeah.\n\n144\n00:07:26.597 --> 00:07:27.651\n>> But who knows.\n\n145\n00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:28.463\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now,\n\n146\n00:07:28.463 --> 00:07:30.810\nthis is still not a whole heck of a lot.\n\n147\n00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.455\nI mentioned that I have\nMicrosoft Office installed and\n\n148\n00:07:33.455 --> 00:07:35.190\nI see this generic office one here.\n\n149\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.832\nBut as you install applications,\n\n150\n00:07:36.832 --> 00:07:39.760\nthe bulk of them will end\nup under your user account.\n\n151\n00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:46.872\nSo if I look under\n/Users/donpezet/Library/QuickLook.\n\n152\n00:07:46.872 --> 00:07:47.772\nDo I not have any?\n\n153\n00:07:47.772 --> 00:07:52.549\nI might not have any, so looking under my\nuser account in my own library/QuickLook\n\n154\n00:07:52.549 --> 00:07:54.541\nyeah, I don't have any in there.\n\n155\n00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:56.937\nSo there's none tied to my user,\nthese are just the only ones that I have.\n\n156\n00:07:56.937 --> 00:07:57.835\nSo you may have a ton.\n\n157\n00:07:57.835 --> 00:07:58.644\nYou may have a few.\n\n158\n00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:02.682\nIt just depends on what all you've\ninstalled on your system, but these little\n\n159\n00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:06.966\ngenerators, these libraries, are what's\nallowing us to pull up that preview and\n\n160\n00:08:06.966 --> 00:08:11.130\nsee it without actually opening\nthe application, it's pretty neat stuff.\n\n161\n00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.890\nBy default, there's a lot of file\nformats that are supported, but\n\n162\n00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:19.460\nif you're working with AutoCAD or\nAdobe Illustrator or something like that,\n\n163\n00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.270\nthose aren't included by default,\nthe vendors will provide those.\n\n164\n00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.510\nAnd that's when they'll start to\nshow up on your user account or\n\n165\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.010\nin the other folders, and it'll grow\nwith the applications that you install.\n\n166\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.350\n>> Yeah I remember the first\ntime I actually ran into this.\n\n167\n00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.370\nI thought that obviously Mac\ndoes a lot of things by default.\n\n168\n00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.250\nAnd I got my first Mac when\nI started working here, and\n\n169\n00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.590\nI was working with our markdown editors.\n\n170\n00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.020\nAnd I had, I started using Atom,\n\n171\n00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.640\nwell before that, I tried out a few\nothers, one of them was Textwrangler.\n\n172\n00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.240\nAnd when I was looking at the files,\nit was showing me that preview,\n\n173\n00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.600\nbefore I opened the file,\nletting me see if I have the right one.\n\n174\n00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.400\nWell then I uninstalled Textwrangler,\nand that preview option went away,\n\n175\n00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.390\nand I was like,\nwhy isn't that doing that anymore?\n\n176\n00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.502\nAnd I ran into this, and\nI figured out what was going on.\n\n177\n00:08:57.502 --> 00:09:00.080\n>> Yeah, Textwrangler,\nthat was natively written for\n\n178\n00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.640\nMac OS versus Atom that's multiplatform,\nso\n\n179\n00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.710\nthey didn't bother with the quick\nlook stuff, yeah, that happens a lot.\n\n180\n00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.740\n>> I actually have Textwrangler installed,\neven though I don't use it, just so\n\n181\n00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.905\nI can get the preview feature.\n\n182\n00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:12.425\n>> [LAUGH] Well,\nthat's one way to get around it.\n\n183\n00:09:12.425 --> 00:09:15.973\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so that's pretty much it for\n\n184\n00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:20.010\nquick look, I feel like I'm leaving\nsomething out, but that's about it.\n\n185\n00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.090\nIt's not amazingly spectacular,\nit's just you get nice little icons.\n\n186\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:29.600\nI guess one thing worth mentioning is\nyou don't always see these previews,\n\n187\n00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.000\nso, actually, wait a minute,\nlet me talk about the actual previews.\n\n188\n00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.801\nSo depending on the view that we're in, so\n\n189\n00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:37.500\nthe view that I'm in\nhere is the icon view,\n\n190\n00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.370\nif I switch to my listview it goes to\nthe generic icon, see how their generic.\n\n191\n00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.310\nAnd it's just because they're so\nsmall that I don't see the previews, so\n\n192\n00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.740\nwe don't always see the preview for that.\n\n193\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.060\nWhen we start going into some\nof our other views though\n\n194\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.070\nyou might get the full on preview.\n\n195\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.820\nSo when I switch into this view here,\nwhich is the show items as\n\n196\n00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.550\nicons in a list blah blah blah, or cover\nview, you got a couple of different views,\n\n197\n00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:07.370\nsome of these views get really detailed\nas far as showing what's going on.\n\n198\n00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.450\nSo depending on the view that you're\nin in the finder, you may not see that.\n\n199\n00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.070\nAnd you can switch views right\nhere using these buttons, or\n\n200\n00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:20.410\nyou can always go up top to your view menu\nand it's got show preview as an option.\n\n201\n00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.490\nAnd if you choose show preview, when you\nclick that, that makes that right bar\n\n202\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.920\nappear, and so now I'm able to look\nover there and there's that quick view,\n\n203\n00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.390\nsame thing that I saw in the get info\nscreen is now being rendered over here.\n\n204\n00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.870\nAnd as I click on each one I\ncan see that preview coming up,\n\n205\n00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.400\nso if you don't see it by default\nyou can just go and turn it on.\n\n206\n00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.870\nBut just remember, it does matter\nwhich view you're in whether or\n\n207\n00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.180\nnot you're going to be\nable to see this area.\n\n208\n00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.420\nBut even in the ones that don't normally\ninclude the preview you can turn it on\n\n209\n00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.659\nby just going to your view menu and\nchoosing show preview.\n\n210\n00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.660\nAll right so, enough about that,\nlet's talk about another one.\n\n211\n00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.950\nThat was really just a quick look\n\n212\n00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.230\nlibrary that's installed that\nallows us to preview things.\n\n213\n00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.880\nBut there is another thing\nthat we need to be aware of,\n\n214\n00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.620\nthere's an interesting behavior that\nhappens, let me show you a text edit.\n\n215\n00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.710\nSo I've been working in textedit and\nin my documents I've got two files,\n\n216\n00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.860\nI've got my impressive document and\nI've got another impressive document.\n\n217\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.990\nSo these are the two amazing documents\nthat I've been working with and\n\n218\n00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.620\nI'm gonna hide that preview.\n\n219\n00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.490\nLet's say I wanna create another document,\n\n220\n00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.370\nthat's gonna be even more\nimpressive than the other two.\n\n221\n00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.310\n>> Stupendous document.\n\n222\n00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.610\n>> All right we'll go with stupendous.\n\n223\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:31.580\nI think I can spell that.\n\n224\n00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:36.180\nSo I'm going to fire up this new\ndocument and I'm going to create\n\n225\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:42.410\nDon's Stupendous Document,\nwhich I did spell wrong after all.\n\n226\n00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.910\nSo this is my stupendous document,\nit's going to be amazing.\n\n227\n00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.902\nI start to work with it,\nnow, as I work with it,\n\n228\n00:11:49.902 --> 00:11:55.610\nI'm you writing all of my stuff and\ngetting things done and\n\n229\n00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:00.890\nI don't save it, I take a lunch break I\nget up and I walk away and I got to lunch.\n\n230\n00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:05.140\nWhile I'm at lunch somebody comes up to\nmy computer and says, yeah well Don's not\n\n231\n00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.480\nhere, l'm gonna use the computer, let me\njust log him out, and they log me out.\n\n232\n00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.360\nWell, what happens when\nan application closes, and\n\n233\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.530\nI've got a document that I never saved?\n\n234\n00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.510\nSo, this one still shows up here\nas untitled, it's been edited,\n\n235\n00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.060\nI haven't saved it.\n\n236\n00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.930\nIf somebody tries to\nclose out of Textedit,\n\n237\n00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:26.020\nit's gonna offer to save it, it's offering\nto save, so that I don't lose my data.\n\n238\n00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.965\nWell, it gets kind of annoying,\nif you're in a hurry to shut down,\n\n239\n00:12:28.965 --> 00:12:30.788\nyou got all these windows asking to save.\n\n240\n00:12:30.788 --> 00:12:33.880\nAnd you got to name them and stuff, so\nwhoever it is just says, you know what?\n\n241\n00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.110\nForget it, I'm just gonna say don't save,\nI'm gonna quit it and\n\n242\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.150\nif Don couldn't be bothered to hit\nthe save button, I'm not either.\n\n243\n00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.980\nI'm gonna hit don't save,\n\n244\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.925\nand that document is now gone, I don't\nhave the stupendous document anymore.\n\n245\n00:12:44.925 --> 00:12:49.490\nBut starting back with Mavericks,\n\n246\n00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.780\nApple introduced a neat new\nfeature that was called autosave.\n\n247\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.890\nAnd what auto save would do is it would\ntake your documents that you've been\n\n248\n00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:02.300\nediting, and even though you haven't\nsaved it, it would retain a copy.\n\n249\n00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.720\nAnd that way the next time I\nfired up Textedit, like here,\n\n250\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.964\nI fire up Textedit Textedit doesn't care\nthat I was working on a document before.\n\n251\n00:13:08.964 --> 00:13:12.380\nI get an all new one,\nI lost that document, but\n\n252\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.390\nwith autosave,\nit'll take me right back to where I was,\n\n253\n00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:19.940\nright into that document that I was\nediting, and I never had to save it.\n\n254\n00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.940\nObviously, I want to save it, I need to\nsave it eventually, but I haven't, here,\n\n255\n00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.480\nit brings it right back and I get into it.\n\n256\n00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.070\nNow that's not the default,\nsee how it didn't do it here,\n\n257\n00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.940\nI lost my document, I'm mad now, well,\nI'm mad at myself cuz I didn't hit save,\n\n258\n00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.610\nI shouldn't be mad at somebody else.\n\n259\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:38.430\nBut we need to turn on autosave if we\nreally wanna take full advantage of it,\n\n260\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.880\nand as you see right here\nit is off by default.\n\n261\n00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.430\nSo the way we get it configured,\n\n262\n00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.160\nis there's two options that\nwe need to manipulate.\n\n263\n00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.940\nI'm gonna go to my system preferences,\nand in the system preferences,\n\n264\n00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.280\nI'm gonna go into the general preferences.\n\n265\n00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.530\nAnd inside of general,\nthere's two options that impact autosave,\n\n266\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.480\nnow it doesn't say autosave anywhere\nhere on these preferences, but\n\n267\n00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.910\nthat's what this is called,\non the exam, this is called autosave.\n\n268\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.392\nThese two options\nare the ones I care about,\n\n269\n00:14:04.392 --> 00:14:09.380\nfirst off, ask to keep changes\nwhen closing documents.\n\n270\n00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.150\nIf I have a document and\nI start to make changes and\n\n271\n00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.100\nI close it,\nshould it ask me if I wanna keep changes?\n\n272\n00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.290\nThe default is that it's not going to,\nit's not gonna ask me to keep the changes.\n\n273\n00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.880\nWell I just saw that text that it does,\n\n274\n00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.550\nwell that's a function inside\na text that it's gonna ask.\n\n275\n00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.290\nBut here it's saying should I ask\nto keep those changes or not?\n\n276\n00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.790\nIf I say yes,\nevery time I close the document it's gonna\n\n277\n00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:36.170\nask me if I want to keep those changes,\nand normally you'd save at that point.\n\n278\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.270\nAnd the other option is close\nwindows when quitting an app, if\n\n279\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:44.250\nyou have an application open, and you've\ngot two or three different windows and\n\n280\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:49.030\nyou quit out of that application,\nwhat happens the next time you launch it?\n\n281\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.100\nWhat's it gonna go back to?\n\n282\n00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.490\nWell, you guys saw with Textedit\nwhen I closed that one app and\n\n283\n00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:57.270\nI launched it again, it just took me\nto a blank window and that was that.\n\n284\n00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:02.100\nSo, for example,\nlet me leave it the way that it is,\n\n285\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.210\nI'm gonna go back to my documents.\n\n286\n00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:08.245\nI'm gonna open up my impressive document\nso there's one text edit window, and\n\n287\n00:15:08.245 --> 00:15:10.900\nI\"m gonna open up my other\nimpressive document, so\n\n288\n00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.280\nnow, I've got two text edit windows open.\n\n289\n00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.620\nI'm gonna go into Textedit, and I'm gonna\nquit, so I just quit out of Textedit.\n\n290\n00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.985\nAnd now, I'm gonna launch Textedit again,\n\n291\n00:15:21.985 --> 00:15:25.870\nand it takes me to a blank window,\nI lost my previous session.\n\n292\n00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:30.760\nWell, as anybody who uses a tabbed web\nbrowser has probably learned, it's kinda\n\n293\n00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.620\nnice when you launch that web browser up\nand all your old tabs are still there.\n\n294\n00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.710\nYou pick up right where you left,\n\n295\n00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.410\nI love that feature I miss\nit when I don't have it.\n\n296\n00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.150\n>> It's heaven on earth literally.\n\n297\n00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.100\n>> You get addicted to it.\n\n298\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.337\nI get really ticked off when I launch\nthe browser and all my tabs are gone,\n\n299\n00:15:43.337 --> 00:15:44.888\nI'm like [SOUND], I needed those.\n\n300\n00:15:44.888 --> 00:15:49.709\nWell, we can extend that functionality\nto every application by using this\n\n301\n00:15:49.709 --> 00:15:51.016\noption right here.\n\n302\n00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:55.783\nWhen you say don't close the windows when\nquitting an app, what does that mean?\n\n303\n00:15:55.783 --> 00:15:57.978\nI'm gonna close the app and\nthe windows are gonna stay open?\n\n304\n00:15:57.978 --> 00:16:03.590\nNo, you're gonna close the app and it's\ngonna remember the windows you had open.\n\n305\n00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.850\nIt's gonna store app data,\n\n306\n00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.870\nthat's why this is part of app data,\nsomewhere other than the app, right?\n\n307\n00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.034\nWe're gonna remember\nthe windows that were open so\n\n308\n00:16:11.034 --> 00:16:12.703\nthat you can return right back to them.\n\n309\n00:16:12.703 --> 00:16:14.329\nSo I'm gonna turn that off.\n\n310\n00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:18.270\nI'm gonna say don't close the windows\nwhen quitting the app, right?\n\n311\n00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.500\nAnd now, I'm gonna open up\nthese two TextEdit windows.\n\n312\n00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.647\nI thought we turned that preview off.\n\n313\n00:16:23.647 --> 00:16:25.410\nAll right, well, we'll do it twice.\n\n314\n00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:26.980\nSecond time, much more authority.\n\n315\n00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.510\nSo there we go, I've got my two\nlittle windows open, right?\n\n316\n00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.100\nAnd I'm gonna quit out of TextEdit,\nso I quit TextEdit.\n\n317\n00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.640\nAnd then I'm gonna launch TextEdit again.\n\n318\n00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.086\nAnd this time when I launch it,\n\n319\n00:16:39.086 --> 00:16:41.190\nthere's the documents that\nI was working on last time.\n\n320\n00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.200\nIt took me right back to\nthe windows I was working on.\n\n321\n00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.340\nOkay, that's a pretty neat feature, right?\n\n322\n00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.020\nIt takes me right back to where I was.\n\n323\n00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:54.000\nWell, where it gets really neat is\nwhen we talk about a new document.\n\n324\n00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.610\nSo I go into TextEdit, and\nI create a new document, right?\n\n325\n00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.280\nAnd, I guess I could have\nleft those other ones open.\n\n326\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.040\nSo there's my very impressive document,\nhere's my impressive document.\n\n327\n00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:10.250\nAnd now I'm gonna create the stupendous\ndocument that Daniel was referencing.\n\n328\n00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:16.047\nSo, this is my stupendous,\nI spelled it wrong twice?\n\n329\n00:17:16.047 --> 00:17:17.305\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Document, apparently,\n\n330\n00:17:17.305 --> 00:17:18.700\nI don't know how to spell stupendous.\n\n331\n00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.590\nSo there it is,\nthis is my stupendous document.\n\n332\n00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.341\nAnd I'm not gonna save it,\ncuz that's the kinda guy I am, right?\n\n333\n00:17:23.341 --> 00:17:24.874\nSo I'm not gonna save it.\n\n334\n00:17:24.874 --> 00:17:28.137\nI'm gonna go to TextEdit,\nI'm gonna quit out.\n\n335\n00:17:28.137 --> 00:17:32.160\nIt didn't ask me, hey,\ndo you wanna save that document, Don?\n\n336\n00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.410\nYou were kinda working on it,\nyou might want it.\n\n337\n00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.400\nIt just closed, all right?\n\n338\n00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.140\nIf I launch TextEdit again,\nit's gonna take me right back.\n\n339\n00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:46.030\nThere's the two documents I was editing,\nand this is my stupendous document.\n\n340\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.530\nIt's still untitled, it's still marked\nas edited, I've never saved it.\n\n341\n00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.670\nBut now I get right back to where I was.\n\n342\n00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:54.330\n>> That's a heck of a magic trick there,\nDon.\n\n343\n00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:54.978\n>> It's a cool feature.\n\n344\n00:17:54.978 --> 00:17:55.605\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n345\n00:17:55.605 --> 00:17:58.690\n>> And it's called Auto Save.\n\n346\n00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.810\nAs I work with a document, it's\nautomatically saving it in the background\n\n347\n00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.740\nwhether I choose to or not, right?\n\n348\n00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.090\nAnd so, as I edit it, as I make those\nchanges, I don't have to worry about,\n\n349\n00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.410\nI forgot to save or, the power went out.\n\n350\n00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.610\nPower goes out, who cares?\n\n351\n00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:13.820\nYou power your system back on,\n\n352\n00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.620\nit goes back into TextEdit,\nthere's the program right there.\n\n353\n00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:21.150\nNow, I've stayed in TextEdit this\nwhole time, and why did I do that?\n\n354\n00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.880\nWell, Apple just introduced\nthis a few versions ago.\n\n355\n00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.230\nAnd when it first came out, the only stuff\nthat supported it were Apple programs.\n\n356\n00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.990\nSo you had to be using TextEdit or\nPages, Numbers,\n\n357\n00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:34.520\none of those applications in\norder to get the support.\n\n358\n00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.560\nThey were the only ones that did it.\n\n359\n00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.560\nBut it's been a few versions now, there's\nthe Mavericks and there's Yosemite,\n\n360\n00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.120\nnow there's El Capitan.\n\n361\n00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.570\nAnd so the third parties have\nreally started to jump onto it.\n\n362\n00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:51.340\nAnd so most applications support it now,\nmost applications support Auto Save.\n\n363\n00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.500\nBut how do you know?\n\n364\n00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.720\nWell, you could test it like I just did,\nbut there's actually an easy way to tell.\n\n365\n00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.200\nWhen you're working on a document,\nnormally,\n\n366\n00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.460\nwhen you're working on a document,\n\n367\n00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:05.050\nif you go to your File menu, you'll\nsee things like Save and Close, right?\n\n368\n00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:08.520\nI can close a document, I can save it,\nthose are normal activities.\n\n369\n00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.910\nBut if Auto Save is supported,\nyou'll see more.\n\n370\n00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:16.540\nYou'll start to see things like Duplicate,\nRename.\n\n371\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.440\nI can rename the file right here\nfrom inside of the application.\n\n372\n00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.240\nBelieve it or not,\nthat's a function of Auto Save.\n\n373\n00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.880\nWhen I rename the file in the background,\n\n374\n00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.920\nAuto Save is saying let's\nchange this file's location.\n\n375\n00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.260\nNormally you can't rename a file while you\nhave it open, it's gonna break things.\n\n376\n00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.350\nBut with Auto Save, you can.\n\n377\n00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.900\nAnd it just says, okay, yeah,\nit's got a different name now, who cares?\n\n378\n00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.360\nAnd we'll write to this other filename,\nwe're in business.\n\n379\n00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.046\nOr move it, normally you can't\nmove a file while it's open,\n\n380\n00:19:40.046 --> 00:19:42.200\nit's locked by the operating system.\n\n381\n00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.440\nBut with Auto Save, it's just,\nokay, I'll save a copy over here.\n\n382\n00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.830\nAnd now you're writing over there,\nand I can remove the other one.\n\n383\n00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.400\nAnd so\nI can move it while the file is open.\n\n384\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.950\nBut the biggest indicator that\nwe've got Auto Save is Revert To.\n\n385\n00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.910\nIt's got a miniature\nTime Machine built into it.\n\n386\n00:19:58.910 --> 00:19:59.945\nYeah, I know that just sounds weird.\n\n387\n00:19:59.945 --> 00:20:02.349\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's got a miniature Time Machine.\n\n388\n00:20:02.349 --> 00:20:07.370\nSo as I start to edit the document, right,\nso if I go back here to this one, right.\n\n389\n00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.450\nSo this document where I made it red and\nblue, right,\n\n390\n00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.870\nwe started adding a little\nbit of color to it.\n\n391\n00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:20.000\nWell, on it, if I go up here to File >\nRevert To, I've got Browse All Versions.\n\n392\n00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.460\nAnd I can click on that,\nand it's gonna come up, and\n\n393\n00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.360\nhere's my Time Machine for this one file.\n\n394\n00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.420\nHere's the current document, and\nthen my head's covering it up, but\n\n395\n00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.340\nI got some little arrows over here.\n\n396\n00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:39.492\nAnd I can start to scroll back in time to\nlook at early versions of the document.\n\n397\n00:20:39.492 --> 00:20:45.370\nAnd so I can get back to, maybe I really\ndon't like that red, white, and blue.\n\n398\n00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:49.915\nAnd so, somebody is gonna edit\nthat audio bit out, anyhow.\n\n399\n00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:50.567\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n400\n00:20:50.567 --> 00:20:53.121\nI'm gonna just kinda get rid of that part,\nand\n\n401\n00:20:53.121 --> 00:20:57.950\nI can hit Restore and it's gonna put me\nback to the way that it was at that time.\n\n402\n00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.540\nThat was a previous version,\nit kept track of it.\n\n403\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.690\nNow the red, white, and blue one,\nthat one's still a previous version too,\n\n404\n00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.680\nI can still roll back to it,\nbut now I've got it.\n\n405\n00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.136\nMiniature Time Machine\ncreated by Auto Save.\n\n406\n00:21:07.136 --> 00:21:10.030\nAnd Auto Save is doing it a lot\nmore frequently than Time Machine.\n\n407\n00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.842\nTime Machine runs a backup once an hour.\n\n408\n00:21:11.842 --> 00:21:16.082\nAuto Save is running it every couple\nof minutes, it's very, very frequent.\n\n409\n00:21:16.082 --> 00:21:19.280\nAnd then once I save it,\nthen those things kinda go away.\n\n410\n00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.440\nBut it's keeping track of those changes so\nI don't lose them.\n\n411\n00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.930\nAnd if I don't save this document, so if\nI just start making a bunch of changes in\n\n412\n00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.540\nhere and I type whatever,\nright, and I don't save it.\n\n413\n00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.610\nWell, it's just like a brand new\nfile that, if I go in here and\n\n414\n00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.580\nI quit TextEdit, it didn't ask me to save.\n\n415\n00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:43.123\nAnd when I relaunch Text Edit,\nit's gonna go back into TextEdit, and\n\n416\n00:21:43.123 --> 00:21:45.750\nthere's my changes that I never saved.\n\n417\n00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.360\nAnd now that's my another\nimpressive document.\n\n418\n00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:54.100\nIf I quit out, and I go to the base\nfile here, look at the preview.\n\n419\n00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:58.550\nI can actually see in the preview\nthat junk text that I injected there.\n\n420\n00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:02.534\nAnd if I turn on my sidebar and\nlook at it,\n\n421\n00:22:02.534 --> 00:22:06.770\nin the preview, there's that junk text.\n\n422\n00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:12.270\nSo even though I never hit Save, it\nautomatically saved the document for me.\n\n423\n00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.405\nNow I never have to worry\nabout hitting Save again.\n\n424\n00:22:14.405 --> 00:22:19.100\nFrom now on I can start writing documents\nand hey, I didn't hit Save, who cares?\n\n425\n00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.350\nNo big deal, right,\nwe just leave it be and that's it.\n\n426\n00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:26.660\nAnd it's fine,\nit just kinda runs through and that's it.\n\n427\n00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.257\nTechnically, if your\napplication supports Auto Save,\n\n428\n00:22:29.257 --> 00:22:31.140\nyou never need to manually save.\n\n429\n00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.011\n>> That almost seems dangerous, Don.\n\n430\n00:22:33.011 --> 00:22:37.335\nBecause you wanna get into a good habit\nof saying, I'm saving this document,\n\n431\n00:22:37.335 --> 00:22:38.800\nI know it was saved.\n\n432\n00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.500\nAnd if I turn on Auto Save,\nthat might hinder me.\n\n433\n00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.170\nI might get on another laptop or\nwork on another computer, and I'm so\n\n434\n00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:50.100\nused to not hitting Save, I don't\nsave the document and then it's gone.\n\n435\n00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.889\nSo I guess it's like a double edged sword.\n\n436\n00:22:52.889 --> 00:22:56.129\n>> It is, it is, and all right,\nobviously I know how this works.\n\n437\n00:22:56.129 --> 00:22:59.620\nRight, I just explained it, I showed\nyou guys, I understand how it works.\n\n438\n00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.290\nI still hit Cmd+S all the time when\nI'm working, I'm always hitting Save.\n\n439\n00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.130\nAnd the reason I do it is for\na couple of reasons.\n\n440\n00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.190\nOne, I just don't trust computers,\nI guess there's that.\n\n441\n00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.120\nBut two,\nnot every application supports it.\n\n442\n00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.210\nSo I was pointing out how,\nI got on a sidetrack,\n\n443\n00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.580\nbut what I was pointing\nout was that in TextEdit,\n\n444\n00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:21.530\nif you go up here to File, I've got\nDuplicate, Rename, Move To, Revert To.\n\n445\n00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:22.590\nThose are the Auto Save options.\n\n446\n00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:27.700\nNot every application supports Auto Save.\n\n447\n00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:32.330\nSo for example, if I'm editing a document\nin a Markdown editor or something,\n\n448\n00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:35.218\nI think, Daniel,\nyou mentioned that, right?\n\n449\n00:23:35.218 --> 00:23:38.960\nSo let me take, here,\nwe'll take some show notes, for example.\n\n450\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.310\nSo if I take the show notes for\nthis episode,\n\n451\n00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.520\nwe write all our show notes in Markdown.\n\n452\n00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.260\nAnd Apple doesn't really\nhave Markdown support.\n\n453\n00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.170\nSo when I take a look at the file,\nit's got the generic icon for\n\n454\n00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.400\nMarkdown and\nthere's no preview for it, right?\n\n455\n00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.276\nSo it doesn't support that,\nit doesn't have Quick Look for it.\n\n456\n00:23:56.276 --> 00:24:00.035\nAnd if I open it, I use a little\ntext editor called Sublime Text.\n\n457\n00:24:00.035 --> 00:24:06.408\nAnd when I go into Sublime Text, if I go\nup here to File, I don't have Rename,\n\n458\n00:24:06.408 --> 00:24:11.870\nI don't have Move To,\nI don't have previous versions.\n\n459\n00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:16.320\nAnd that's the indicator right there that\nthis program does not support autosave.\n\n460\n00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.275\nAnd so I've gotta be careful,\n\n461\n00:24:17.275 --> 00:24:19.480\nif I'm working in here I've\ngotta remember to hit Save.\n\n462\n00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.180\nSo how do we remember which programs\nsupport it and which ones don't?\n\n463\n00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.340\nIt's kinda tough to, right,\nit's tough to remember that.\n\n464\n00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:32.400\nAnd you'd be surprised, even some of the\nbigger ones like Microsoft Word, depending\n\n465\n00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.920\non the version you're running, if you're\nrunning Word 2011 it doesn't support it.\n\n466\n00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.060\nAnd actually I don't\nremember in the new one.\n\n467\n00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.757\nThis is 2016 I believe,\nlet's see what version of Word this is.\n\n468\n00:24:42.757 --> 00:24:47.400\nThis is Microsoft Word,\n15.2 which is 2016.\n\n469\n00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.661\nAnd so if I'm in here working and\nI go to File,\n\n470\n00:24:51.661 --> 00:24:57.619\nI've got their little Restore but\nit's not the autosave one.\n\n471\n00:24:57.619 --> 00:24:59.530\nSo it looks like they\nhave not integrated it.\n\n472\n00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.862\nLet me just actually save this real quick.\n\n473\n00:25:01.862 --> 00:25:08.120\nI'll just save that wherever and see if I\nget those menu options and yeah, I don't.\n\n474\n00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:13.310\nI don't have it because Microsoft\nhas chosen not to incorporate it\n\n475\n00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.560\nwith the autosave feature.\n\n476\n00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.910\nSo it's up to the third parties to do it.\n\n477\n00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.220\nSo just beware it's not\nsupported everywhere.\n\n478\n00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.042\nBut Safari, TextEdit, Pages, Numbers,\nthose applications, the ones from Apple,\n\n479\n00:25:24.042 --> 00:25:25.224\nthey all support it.\n\n480\n00:25:25.224 --> 00:25:27.800\nAnd a lot of the third parties\nare starting to incorporate that in.\n\n481\n00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.520\n>> Yeah Don, I think of it more as\nlike a backup parachute, right.\n\n482\n00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.710\nI try to get really good\nat doing the Save function.\n\n483\n00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:38.130\nThe, what is that, Cmd+S or\nwhatever it is for your feature.\n\n484\n00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.695\nBut if I forget,\nit might be there as a backup.\n\n485\n00:25:40.695 --> 00:25:45.690\nSo I try to do that, but if I forget,\na lot of them will do it for\n\n486\n00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:46.900\nyou with the autosave.\n\n487\n00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.597\nSo it can be just like that backup for me.\n\n488\n00:25:48.597 --> 00:25:50.586\n>> Yeah, and remember,\nyou can turn it off, right,\n\n489\n00:25:50.586 --> 00:25:52.790\nit's right there in your preferences.\n\n490\n00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.960\nLet me go back to it here.\n\n491\n00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.530\nSo in my System Preferences,\nin General and\n\n492\n00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.970\nthen right down here, Ask to keep\nchanges when closing documents.\n\n493\n00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.520\nClose windows when quitting an app.\n\n494\n00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.898\nWhen you get those set,\n\n495\n00:26:02.898 --> 00:26:05.870\nthen it's gonna work like I just\ndemonstrated for you, right.\n\n496\n00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:09.050\nWhere I said Ask to keep changes,\nit never did ask cuz it didn't have to,\n\n497\n00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.850\nwe supported autosave.\n\n498\n00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:14.090\nBut for programs that don't\nsupport autosave it'll still ask.\n\n499\n00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:16.670\nAnd then the Close windows, that's the\nother important part to turn that on to\n\n500\n00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:17.760\nmake sure you're getting autosave.\n\n501\n00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.000\nBut when those two are set, autosave works\ngreat, you never have to hit Save again\n\n502\n00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.330\nunless you're in an application\nthat doesn't support it.\n\n503\n00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.030\n>> Well Don, do we have any other\ncool features when it comes to\n\n504\n00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:31.240\napplication data that we'd like to\nshow before we wrap up our show?\n\n505\n00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.400\n>> That's about it,\n\n506\n00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.130\nI mean we've obviously got a lot more\nsupport professional stuff to cover.\n\n507\n00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.810\nBut as far as our application data,\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n508\n00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:41.100\n>> Well, it is really cool and\nknowing that's how it turn on autosave,\n\n509\n00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.500\nthat's a really good\nthing to know how to do.\n\n510\n00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.756\nSo Don, we thank you for\nexplaining this things, showing us, and\n\n511\n00:26:46.756 --> 00:26:50.323\nwalking us through the all cool behind\nthe scenes features of our Mac OS.\n\n512\n00:26:50.323 --> 00:26:52.760\nThat being said, looks like we've come\nto the end of another great episode.\n\n513\n00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.050\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n514\n00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.927\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n515\n00:26:55.927 --> 00:26:57.344\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n516\n00:26:57.344 --> 00:26:58.342\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n517\n00:26:58.342 --> 00:27:00.418\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n518\n00:27:00.418 --> 00:27:07.700\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.090\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and today's\nepisode we're continuing on with our\n\n5\n00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.500\nApple certified support\nprofessional series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.880\nJoining us back in the studio again today,\n\n7\n00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.610\nto lend to that effort,\nis our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.710\nDon, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.360\nHow's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.370\n>> It is going great, Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.880\nReady to jump right back into\nthe world of Apple support.\n\n12\n00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.320\nAnd in this episode, we're going\nto talk about application support.\n\n13\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.580\n[LAUGH] And it's kind of funny that\nthe whole show is about support.\n\n14\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.430\nBut what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nfocus on the applications themselves.\n\n15\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.880\nUp until this point, we've really been\ntalking about the operating system.\n\n16\n00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.960\nAnd how we make sure our operating\nsystem is up and running and\n\n17\n00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.050\nhealthy and all the things\nthat Apple builds into Mac OS,\n\n18\n00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.530\nand I'll say it's a great\noperating system.\n\n19\n00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.790\nIt's got a lot of power, a lot of\nfunctionality, but like most operating\n\n20\n00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.900\nsystems, out of the box it's really\njust a fancy platform for a web browser.\n\n21\n00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.580\nThat's what you've got.\n\n22\n00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.930\nSo you're gonna end up installing\nthird party applications.\n\n23\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.260\nEverybody does it, you've got things\nthat you need, you wanna work with.\n\n24\n00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.920\nMaybe it's something\nsimple like a web browser.\n\n25\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.680\nSo I don't like Safari, so\nI wanna install Google Chrome.\n\n26\n00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.110\nGreat you can do that.\n\n27\n00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.210\nOr I need a fully featured office suite so\nI install open office, or\n\n28\n00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.980\nMicrosoft office or whatever.\n\n29\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.780\nPages and numbers are great but\nI prefer one of these other ones.\n\n30\n00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.584\nYou have third party\nsoftware that you need and\n\n31\n00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:29.000\nit made me inhouse software developer,\nthings that you wrote yourself.\n\n32\n00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.981\nSo there's a lot that you may need to add\nto OS10 to get it working the way that\n\n33\n00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:34.020\nyou want.\n\n34\n00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.380\nAnd in our last set of episodes, we talked\nabout application data, where the programs\n\n35\n00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.880\nthat we run, where they store their data\nand kinda the preferences and things.\n\n36\n00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.890\nNow I wanna talk about just\nrunning those applications at all,\n\n37\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.470\ngetting them up and going.\n\n38\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.560\nAnd one of the first things I wanna\nkick off with, our frameworks.\n\n39\n00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.800\nThat a lot of applications,\nthe authors don't write them from scratch.\n\n40\n00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.910\nThey don't write everything\nfrom the bare minimum.\n\n41\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.720\nIf they did,\neverybody would be writing in assembly,\n\n42\n00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.670\none of the really base core languages.\n\n43\n00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.120\nBut people use languages like C++ or\n\n44\n00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.800\nVisual Basic, you got C#, you've got\na ton of the languages out there.\n\n45\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.780\nJava and JavaScript and so on.\n\n46\n00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.280\nThey write applications in\nthese programming languages.\n\n47\n00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.595\nAnd those programming languages have\nlibraries associated with them that\n\n48\n00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:21.060\nalready have some of the easier,\nmore mundane tasks already done.\n\n49\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.490\nSo for example, let's say you have an idea\nfor the next great golf score app.\n\n50\n00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.770\nI need a program to keep\ntrack of golf scoring.\n\n51\n00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.042\nI hate golf.\nSo it doesn't really matter, but.\n\n52\n00:02:31.042 --> 00:02:32.990\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> But if that's what you want to write.\n\n53\n00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.890\nThink about what that app is gonna be.\n\n54\n00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.930\nYou've got 18 holes in golf.\n\n55\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.880\nAnd you need to be able to store how\nmany strokes you had on each hole.\n\n56\n00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.050\nSo you've gotta write that down.\n\n57\n00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.050\nSo, you're gonna need some little\nfields to be able to type numbers in.\n\n58\n00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.730\nAnd you're probably gonna\nneed a save button, or\n\n59\n00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.170\na print button to be able to print,\nand so on.\n\n60\n00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.490\nWell, you're not the first person\nto think of text entry in a field.\n\n61\n00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.260\nYou're not the first person to think\nof a save button or a print button,\n\n62\n00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.130\nplenty of other people have\nalready thought of that before.\n\n63\n00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.780\nSo why reinvent the wheel,\nwhy do a task that's already been done?\n\n64\n00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.610\nSo these libraries that are out\nthere already have buttons,\n\n65\n00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.940\nthey already have text fields.\n\n66\n00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.645\nAnd so now when you say I need\na text field for hole number seven.\n\n67\n00:03:10.645 --> 00:03:15.440\nI just add this pre-built text field and\nassign a variable name to it and\n\n68\n00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.250\nnow I've got it.\n\n69\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.470\nIt saves a ton of time and it makes\ndevelopment a lot more consistent and\n\n70\n00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.450\na lot more fast.\n\n71\n00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.400\nYou get things done more quickly.\n\n72\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.050\nSo applications rely on that.\n\n73\n00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.890\nSo when you install a program,\nit may or may not be self contained.\n\n74\n00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.530\nNow thanks to Apple sandboxing,\n\n75\n00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.050\na lot of applications these\ndays are self contained.\n\n76\n00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.400\nThey've got all the components\ninside of them that are necessary.\n\n77\n00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.650\nBut that's not always the case.\n\n78\n00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.250\nSo if I'm gonna be supporting third party\napplications that need a framework,\n\n79\n00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.240\nI might need to install that framework.\n\n80\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.090\nAnd one of the best\nexamples of that is Java.\n\n81\n00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.790\nAnd I know I've made fun\nof Java in other shows.\n\n82\n00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.040\nJava, it started from a company\ncalled Sun Microsystems.\n\n83\n00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.240\nAnd they had this idea of,\nhey when I write a program,\n\n84\n00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.210\nI don't wanna have to write a Windows\nversion and a Mac version, and\n\n85\n00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.100\na Linux version, and\na mobile phone version.\n\n86\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.780\nWouldn't it be nice if I get to\nwrite one version of the app and\n\n87\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.598\nthen it runs every where, right?\n\n88\n00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.270\nWrite once, run everywhere.\n\n89\n00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.940\nThat was their motto\nwhen they created Java.\n\n90\n00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.440\nAnd that's exactly what they did, is they\ncreated this Java runtime environment,\n\n91\n00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.020\na framework.\n\n92\n00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.170\nSun wrote the framework for Mac, and\n\n93\n00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.900\nthey wrote the framework for\nWindows and they wrote it for Linux and\n\n94\n00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.770\nthey wrote it for mobile devices like\nBlackberry iOS and Windows Mobile.\n\n95\n00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.950\nAnd so and Android and\nwhatever other ones I've left out.\n\n96\n00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.720\nI mean they really were very\nthorough they wrote this engine for\n\n97\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.530\nevery platform that was out there.\n\n98\n00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.000\nSo that if you as a developer wanted to\nwrite an app you could write it in Java\n\n99\n00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.620\nand you now supported all these platforms.\n\n100\n00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.640\nThe old argument was, hey, if I'm\ngonna write a commercial application,\n\n101\n00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.290\nI'm just gonna write it for\nWindows because in the business world,\n\n102\n00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.360\n90% of computers are on Windows, that's\ngoing to be the bulk of the user base.\n\n103\n00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.270\nMac has a 5% market share, so I'll just\ngive up those 5% because it's not worth\n\n104\n00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.520\nthe expense of rewriting the application\nfor Mac for just 5% of the users.\n\n105\n00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.780\nBut if I can just write it in Java,\nand now I support Mac and\n\n106\n00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.000\nLinux anyway, why not?\n\n107\n00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.060\nRight?\nWhy not go that way?\n\n108\n00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.260\nNow, I make fun of Java for two reasons.\n\n109\n00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.050\nAnd one reason is that it's slow.\n\n110\n00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.530\nSo, their old model was,\n\n111\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.300\nwrite once run everywhere, I always\nsay write once run slowly everywhere.\n\n112\n00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.090\nIt's just not very fast and that's\nbecause it uses a just in time compiler.\n\n113\n00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.280\nIt's actually compiling that code for\n\n114\n00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.340\nthat operating system as\nthe application is running.\n\n115\n00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.400\nSo it's not as fast as\na natively written app.\n\n116\n00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.110\n>> Yeah, original Blu-Ray players,\ntheir interfaces ran Java, and\n\n117\n00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.250\nthey were painfully slow.\n\n118\n00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.180\n>> Yeah, it was that, and then people\nwould use these cheap hardware components\n\n119\n00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.710\nbecause they knew that Java would run on\nit, and they were doing the bare minimum.\n\n120\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.810\nAnd it was terrible.\n\n121\n00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.140\nYeah, to this day I've got a,\nwhat is my tv at home?\n\n122\n00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.410\nA Samsung, a Samsung Smart TV.\n\n123\n00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.590\nSo I can pull up it's little Smart TV\nDashboard, but you know, I never do it,\n\n124\n00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.350\nbecause it's so stinking slow.\n\n125\n00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.650\nAnd it's just frustrating.\n\n126\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.490\nSo that's one reason I make fun of Java.\n\n127\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.370\nThe other reason is security.\n\n128\n00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.350\nBecause Java applications\ncan run everywhere,\n\n129\n00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.830\na lot of hackers target Java for exploits.\n\n130\n00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.820\nThey look for vulnerabilities,\nthey find a way to exploit them so\n\n131\n00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.540\nthey can write a virus.\n\n132\n00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.860\nBecause if they can write a virus,\nthe virus can run everywhere.\n\n133\n00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.700\nI can write one virus\nthat runs everywhere.\n\n134\n00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.280\nSo in the Mac world we traditionally\ndon't have to worry about viruses.\n\n135\n00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.520\nThere aren't a lot that are out there.\n\n136\n00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.520\nThere are some but there's not a lot.\n\n137\n00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.250\nNow we open ourselves up.\n\n138\n00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.460\nBut, you may have\napplications that need Java.\n\n139\n00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.190\nAnd in the past, there were two solutions.\n\n140\n00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.080\nNow we've got a new one.\n\n141\n00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.770\nSo I want to talk about all three.\n\n142\n00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.570\nSo, the first one is that if you needed\nJava support, you could go to Adobe,\n\n143\n00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.280\nnot Adobe.\n\n144\n00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.060\nYou could go to Oracle's website and\ndownload it.\n\n145\n00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.660\nNow, where does Oracle come into the mix?\n\n146\n00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.130\nJava was invested by Sun Microsystems,\nOracle bought Sun Microsystem.\n\n147\n00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.880\nSo it's now Oracle Java.\n\n148\n00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.990\nSo if we need to install,\nI got my Mac right here.\n\n149\n00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.310\nLet's pull up my Desktop.\n\n150\n00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.330\nAnd I don't have a Java installed.\n\n151\n00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.350\nIt's easy to tell if you do.\n\n152\n00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.850\nIf you go in your System preferences.\n\n153\n00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.000\nThen in your System Preferences,\nremember there's five categories.\n\n154\n00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.040\nThe first category is Personal,\nthat's the stuff that affects you.\n\n155\n00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.780\nThe second one is Hardware,\nthe third one is Internet and\n\n156\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.310\nSharing, and the fourth one is System.\n\n157\n00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.430\nAnd so the fifth one is not showing up,\nand that's Other,\n\n158\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.350\nthat's where third-party\nstuff would show up.\n\n159\n00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.660\nIf I had the Java framework installed,\nit would show up right there.\n\n160\n00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.450\nI would actually see this fifth\nentry with the Java control panel.\n\n161\n00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:22.610\nNow, if I fire up Safari, and I go to\nJava dot com, if I want to install Java,\n\n162\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.690\nI would just come here and\ndownload it and install it, right?\n\n163\n00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:26.679\nAnd we can install it and get it in place.\n\n164\n00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:31.651\nNow they problem here is,\nit's installing Java as part of my system,\n\n165\n00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:35.460\nand any application will be\nable to call and use Java.\n\n166\n00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.460\nSo now I can run Java apps, that's great.\n\n167\n00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.070\nBut, there's Java exploits\nthat are out there.\n\n168\n00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.420\nAnd this is software\nthat is not from Apple.\n\n169\n00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.310\nI didn't get it from the Apple app store.\n\n170\n00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.440\nSo, it's now up to me,\nto keep it up to date.\n\n171\n00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.110\nI've gotta make sure\nthe Java stays up to date.\n\n172\n00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.804\nCuz if there's an exploit that's out\nthere, my system is now vulnerable.\n\n173\n00:07:54.804 --> 00:07:58.680\nAnd Apple can't do anything about it\nbecause, it's not their software.\n\n174\n00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.914\nI chose to install it, right.\n\n175\n00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:02.235\nWell, I downloaded it,\nI haven't installed it yet.\n\n176\n00:08:02.235 --> 00:08:04.076\nLet me get it installed.\n\n177\n00:08:04.076 --> 00:08:05.834\nI'm on a virtual machine so\nI don't mind installing it.\n\n178\n00:08:05.834 --> 00:08:08.220\nOn my own machine,\nI choose not to install it.\n\n179\n00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.380\nBut I'll install it here.\n\n180\n00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:15.990\nNow when I'm installing it, notice that\nthis is Java version 8, update 77, okay.\n\n181\n00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.060\nLet's talk about that a little bit.\n\n182\n00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.384\nWith Java, it's actually Java version 1.8.\n\n183\n00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.850\nThey used to have these minor versions,\nand then they got to 1.0, and after that\n\n184\n00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.720\nit was 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and they just\ndropped the one point, at the beginning.\n\n185\n00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.901\nSo Java 8 is actually version 1.8.\n\n186\n00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:33.339\nSo this is Java version 8.\n\n187\n00:08:33.339 --> 00:08:40.920\nUpdate 77, they've pushed 77 updates\nsince Java 8 came out, right?\n\n188\n00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.620\nJava 9 is not out yet, and this number is\njust going to keep going up and up and up.\n\n189\n00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.800\nThat shows you how many\nupdates I need to do, and\n\n190\n00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.990\nthe last update was March 23, 2016.\n\n191\n00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.560\nToday is April 1st, so\nthat was seven or eight days ago.\n\n192\n00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.400\nSo last week there was an update,\n\n193\n00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.960\nand I need to apply that update\nif I've already got it installed.\n\n194\n00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.470\nNow I'm gonna install it, and\n\n195\n00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.690\nyou'll notice the installer,\nJava is not an application.\n\n196\n00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.520\nI don't just drag it and\ndrop it in applications folder.\n\n197\n00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.210\nIt's a package.\n\n198\n00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:08.430\nI have to install it.\n\n199\n00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.660\nAnd that's because this is a framework,\nan extension that's going to be installed\n\n200\n00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.430\nunder the hood, behind my GUI, that'll be\na part of the operating system behind it.\n\n201\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.460\nSo I'm going to open this up and\n\n202\n00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.040\nI do have to be an administrator to\ninstall it because it is under the hood.\n\n203\n00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.340\nThis will affect all of\nthe users on my system.\n\n204\n00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.320\nEverybody on this system will\nhave access to Java, all right.\n\n205\n00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.750\nAnd then conveniently,\nI can set my homepage to be Yahoo and\n\n206\n00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.200\nget the best of the web if I want.\n\n207\n00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:34.915\nI'm gonna turn that off.\n\n208\n00:09:34.915 --> 00:09:36.360\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Apparently Oracle has gotta make\n\n209\n00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.880\ntheir money somehow.\n\n210\n00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.500\nAnd there we go.\n\n211\n00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.400\nNow, notice a little advertising here.\n\n212\n00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.660\nThree billion devices running Java.\n\n213\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.820\nThat's that throwback to the fact\nthat it's supported on all these\n\n214\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.520\ndifferent platforms.\n\n215\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.180\nAnd they count mobile phones,\nand that's why it's so big.\n\n216\n00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.750\nTechnically every Android\nphone is Java based.\n\n217\n00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.780\nSo, that's where that's coming from.\n\n218\n00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.090\nSo once it's installed,\nI'm now up and running Java.\n\n219\n00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.360\nI've got it installed in the system.\n\n220\n00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.570\nI can now run Java applications.\n\n221\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:06.620\nAnd I know I've got it because, let me\nclose out of system preferences here.\n\n222\n00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.600\nIf I go back into my system preferences,\nwhen I go in here,\n\n223\n00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.160\nmy screen is a little different.\n\n224\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.810\nI now have a fifth section down\nat the bottom, way down here.\n\n225\n00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.080\nThis is that other section,\nand I've got Java.\n\n226\n00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.540\nSo I can spot that I've got\nit installed right here, and\n\n227\n00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.710\nif I click on that to launch it,\nhere is my Java control panel.\n\n228\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.210\nThat is going to open up\nin a separate window.\n\n229\n00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.090\nHere we go.\n\n230\n00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.643\nAnd so now I can see my Java settings.\n\n231\n00:10:29.643 --> 00:10:34.461\nI am running Java version 8 update 77.\n\n232\n00:10:34.461 --> 00:10:38.185\nI've got an update tab right here and\nhere is where I can configure for updates.\n\n233\n00:10:38.185 --> 00:10:41.620\nIt's set to check automatically and\nit's saying it last ran well,\n\n234\n00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.498\njust minutes ago and I am up to date.\n\n235\n00:10:43.498 --> 00:10:46.570\nBut I've gotta let those\nupdate checks happen.\n\n236\n00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.480\nAnd so every now and then I'm gonna get\nprompted that Java is doing an update and\n\n237\n00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.010\nan update has been found and it's up to\nme to make sure they get installed, and\n\n238\n00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.860\nif I don't install them\nI'm now vulnerable, right?\n\n239\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.690\nAnd Java is a big target and\nit's not very well written,\n\n240\n00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.200\nso there's a lot exploits and\nvulnerability that are out there for it.\n\n241\n00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.190\nA lot security professionals will tell\nyou don't install it, all right, but\n\n242\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.360\nbe careful with that\nbecause you might need it.\n\n243\n00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.310\nI might say, I don't want to run Java, but\nI've got this line of business application\n\n244\n00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.500\nwhere I need to have it,\nI don't have that choice anymore.\n\n245\n00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.120\nNow I have to install it and\nI don't have a choice.\n\n246\n00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.220\nWell, about five years ago, it's probably\nlonger than that, probably six or\n\n247\n00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.150\nseven years ago now,\nApple finally had enough.\n\n248\n00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.880\nAnd they said, look, all right, we can't\ntrust Oracle to do the updates, right, and\n\n249\n00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.640\nwe can't trust them to\nkeep them secure and\n\n250\n00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.210\nit's weakening our system because our\nusers feel like they need to have it.\n\n251\n00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.930\nA lot of vendors out there are writing\nMac's software specifically,\n\n252\n00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.760\nthey're writing Java so it'll run here.\n\n253\n00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.500\nAnd in turn it's weakening our system.\n\n254\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.780\nAnd we're done with it.\n\n255\n00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.910\nAnd so what Apple did,\nis they created their own Java.\n\n256\n00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.560\nThey created their own Java engine,\ntheir Java Runtime Environment.\n\n257\n00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.300\nAnd so, instead of using Oracle's,\ndownloading it right from their website,\n\n258\n00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.790\nwe can download one from Apple.\n\n259\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.320\nNow, you will find many, many, many, many,\n\n260\n00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.720\nmany, many websites out there\ntelling you to do this.\n\n261\n00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.580\nThey'll say, yeah,\ndon't download it from Oracle.\n\n262\n00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.470\nGo and download it from Apple.\n\n263\n00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.375\n>> Is it written in Java?\n\n264\n00:12:07.375 --> 00:12:08.520\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think it's actually\n\n265\n00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.140\nwritten in Coco or whatever.\n\n266\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.830\nBut it's designed to\nexecute the Java apps.\n\n267\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.220\nBut let me just tell you, I'm going\nto go on official record here and\n\n268\n00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.140\nsay it, don't install the Apple one.\n\n269\n00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.520\nBecause six or seven years ago\nwhen Apple did it, it was great.\n\n270\n00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.560\nAnd they kept it up to date,\nand I absolutely ran it.\n\n271\n00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.208\nAnd I did not run the Java one, okay?\n\n272\n00:12:27.208 --> 00:12:33.020\nBut about three or four years ago,\nApple stopped supporting it.\n\n273\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.730\nThey stopped supporting it and\nthey don't update it anymore.\n\n274\n00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.010\nAnd so if you go in and\ninstall Apple's version of Java,\n\n275\n00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.400\nall those websites that are telling\nyou that it's better, more stable,\n\n276\n00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.000\nmore secure, they're now wrong,\nbecause it hasn't been updated in years.\n\n277\n00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.220\nAnd so be really careful.\n\n278\n00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:50.393\nI know people to this very day,\nthat swear by the Apple version,\n\n279\n00:12:50.393 --> 00:12:52.340\nit's a recipe for disaster.\n\n280\n00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.480\nIt's got exploits,\nit's got vulnerabilities and\n\n281\n00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.810\nit did have not been passed because\nApple no longer supports it.\n\n282\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:57.510\nThey made that decision.\n\n283\n00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.590\nThey just said, look,\nApple's gotten a lot more popular.\n\n284\n00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.370\nPeople are writing native\nMac apps these days.\n\n285\n00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:04.840\nWe don't need to rely on Java.\n\n286\n00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.060\nLet's get rid of that, right?\n\n287\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.090\nAnd they stopped supporting it.\n\n288\n00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:12.790\nSo if you go and find it, here, let me\njust see if I can find it real quick.\n\n289\n00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.670\nIf you find the page for it, here it is.\n\n290\n00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.990\nYou'll notice that it's dated,\nactually it's dated 2015.\n\n291\n00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.960\nSo last update came out last year,\nthat's not too terribly long ago.\n\n292\n00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.940\nBut here it is.\n\n293\n00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:31.080\nJava for OS X 2015-001 installs\nthe legacy Java 6 run time, okay.\n\n294\n00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.390\nWe just saw, we're on Java 8,\nupdate 77, and\n\n295\n00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:39.070\nthis is installing Java 6, so\nwe are two versions back, right?\n\n296\n00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:43.270\nAnd it's designed to be installed and\nthey've got it here for\n\n297\n00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.180\nwell El Capitan if I want to stall it and\nMountain Lion and so on.\n\n298\n00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:51.383\nThe package is exclusive intended for\nsupport of Legacy software, and\n\n299\n00:13:51.383 --> 00:13:56.933\ninstalls the same depricated version\nof Java 6 included in the 2014 and\n\n300\n00:13:56.933 --> 00:13:58.511\n2013 releases.\n\n301\n00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:01.914\nSo even though this is the 2015-001,\n\n302\n00:14:01.914 --> 00:14:07.509\nit's the same version of Java\nincluded in the 2013-005 released.\n\n303\n00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:12.170\nThat means it is not being updated\nin over three years, right.\n\n304\n00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.040\nThat is not something that you wanna run.\n\n305\n00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.030\nAnd that's why you\nreally shouldn't run it.\n\n306\n00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.710\nIt's just here in case you have some\nkind of software that depends on it.\n\n307\n00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.140\nSome software that it is written and\nneeds it.\n\n308\n00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.770\nBut if you got that,\nyou really need to replace it.\n\n309\n00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.930\n>> Well, Don, the good news is that\nJava was bad cross platform because\n\n310\n00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.610\nI've supported a Windows environment.\n\n311\n00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.310\nAnd there were a line of business\napplications that were telling me to\n\n312\n00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.260\ninstall older versions of Java,\nbecause that's what they required to run.\n\n313\n00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.130\nAnd again, then you start well there's\na nice security issue right here.\n\n314\n00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.660\nAnd we had to try to work with\nthose people, they were like, no,\n\n315\n00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.900\nwe need that for\nthe way we wrote this code.\n\n316\n00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.930\nIt's gotta have the older version so-\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n317\n00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.090\n>> We're stuck with it.\n\n318\n00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:49.620\n>> Now, fortunately, Apple has kind\nof created a better solution for us.\n\n319\n00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.981\nAnd they said, look, some applications\nare gonna use Java, we understand that.\n\n320\n00:14:52.981 --> 00:14:56.690\nBut those applications are gonna be\ninherently less secure because of it.\n\n321\n00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.870\nSo, in El Capital we have\napplication sandboxing, right,\n\n322\n00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.360\nwe create these little jails for\neach application.\n\n323\n00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.920\nSo what Apple did is they said look,\nfrom now on,\n\n324\n00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.400\nif you need Java,\nbuild Java into your application.\n\n325\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.760\nInclude it with the application.\n\n326\n00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.540\nThat way when you run it,\nyou can call your own instances of Java.\n\n327\n00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.890\nYou can have the exact versions and\nfiles that you need, and\n\n328\n00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.790\nif an exploit is used,\nit's only that application that's weak.\n\n329\n00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.950\nSo, and we've actually kind of\nseen it in the show already,\n\n330\n00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.930\nI use Cyberduck in another episode, right?\n\n331\n00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.200\nSo if I go in and pull Cyberduck again,\nI'm gonna go to their website,\n\n332\n00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.060\nI'm gonna download Cyberduck.\n\n333\n00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.710\nAnd so I'll download it for Mac, and\n\n334\n00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:39.750\nonce it gets downloaded, it's gonna\ndownload that Cyberduck app, right?\n\n335\n00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:43.150\nAnd remember that an application,\nall an application is,\n\n336\n00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.680\nis a folder that stores the various\nother application data inside of it.\n\n337\n00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.652\nAnd if I browse into\nCyberduck's application,\n\n338\n00:15:49.652 --> 00:15:53.936\nyou'll actually find where it's got\na copy of Java inside of the app.\n\n339\n00:15:53.936 --> 00:15:56.070\nSo I don't have to install\nit on my computer.\n\n340\n00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:59.369\nWhen I install it on the computer\nit weakens the computer as a whole.\n\n341\n00:15:59.369 --> 00:16:05.240\nWhen it's sand-boxed inside the app,\nit only weakens that one app.\n\n342\n00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.350\nSo now if I've got a single app that\nrequires Java, it can be weak, and\n\n343\n00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.560\nall my other apps will be fine and\n\n344\n00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.460\nprotected and safe cuz they're\nall isolated from each other.\n\n345\n00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.050\nAnd we'll see that as soon as I\nfinish this download, all right.\n\n346\n00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.350\nNow if you're ever curious which\nversion of Java you have installed,\n\n347\n00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.030\nit's kinda hard to find it in the GUI.\n\n348\n00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.780\nIn fact, I don't even know that I can\ntell you a way to find it in the GUI.\n\n349\n00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.944\nThe easiest way to find is\nto jump into your terminal.\n\n350\n00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:33.102\nAnd in your terminal you can just\nrun Java --version, like that.\n\n351\n00:16:33.102 --> 00:16:36.890\nAnd when you run Java --version, it'll\ntell you which version you're running.\n\n352\n00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.390\nAnd notice what I got the first\ntime is it's warning me hey,\n\n353\n00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.080\nI was running this and I don't have\nthe command line utilities installed.\n\n354\n00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.320\nApparently, when I installed it,\nI only did the runtime environment.\n\n355\n00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.690\nSo it wants to install the command line.\n\n356\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.590\nBut when you run Java -- version, it'll\ntell you which version you got installed.\n\n357\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.910\nIf I had installed the Apple one,\nit would have reported back and\n\n358\n00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.260\ntold me that it was running the Apple one,\nversion six.\n\n359\n00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.490\nAnd here, if I install the command line,\nit'll show it there.\n\n360\n00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:00.500\nSo that's one of the easy ways.\n\n361\n00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.350\n>> I believe you can also\ngo to the Java website and\n\n362\n00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.790\nit will detect what version you have and\nlet's you know.\n\n363\n00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.960\nSo it's a little more graphical,\nif you're into that.\n\n364\n00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.510\n>> Yeah, I didn't run it, but\nafter I did the download,\n\n365\n00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.460\nthat button changed to a Verify Install\nand that's where you'd go and see that.\n\n366\n00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.517\nSo yep,\nyou can find it a few different ways.\n\n367\n00:17:15.517 --> 00:17:18.170\nAll right, so let's see if Cyberduck\nis done installing, it is, all right.\n\n368\n00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.420\nSo if I take Cyberduck, right,\nand I can drag all Cyberduck and\n\n369\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.790\ndrop it into my application so\nit's installed.\n\n370\n00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:27.690\nBut if I Ctrl+click on that and\ndo Show Package Contents,\n\n371\n00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:31.330\nwe can browse into this thing and\ntake a look at what's inside of it.\n\n372\n00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.170\nAnd as we look inside of it,\n\n373\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.270\nyou can start to spot some of\nthe frameworks that are part of it.\n\n374\n00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.400\nAs well as some of the other libraries and\n\n375\n00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.920\nother things that are associated\nwith getting it to run.\n\n376\n00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.762\nNow when I go under MacOS where\nthe executables are, right there,\n\n377\n00:17:44.762 --> 00:17:49.820\nRuntime.jre, it's got the Java\nruntime environment packaged\n\n378\n00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.440\nright here with the application, whoops.\n\n379\n00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.990\nWith the application,\nif I can get it to expand, and\n\n380\n00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:59.750\nwhat I'm seeing right here are all\nthe Java files that are necessary.\n\n381\n00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.670\nSo here's the Java applets,\nthese JAR's, those are Java archives.\n\n382\n00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.370\nAnd so it's got all the classes and\n\n383\n00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:10.280\nall the other information that a Java app\nneeds to run built right into the app.\n\n384\n00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.070\nSo I don't have to install\nJava just to run CyberDuck.\n\n385\n00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:17.850\nI can do it, just with CyberDuck, cuz it's\nbuilt in, it's a part of the sandbox.\n\n386\n00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.680\nSo that's the way most applications\nare moving these days so\n\n387\n00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.720\ndon't feel like you have to install Java,\nalways test your applications\n\n388\n00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.740\nbecause they might have it built in,\nand that problem kind of solves itself.\n\n389\n00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.640\n>> Awesome, well Don,\n\n390\n00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.660\nwe were talking about applications on our\nMac operating systems, I guess we'd be\n\n391\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.500\nreally remiss if we didn't mentioned\nsomething like I don't know, iCloud.\n\n392\n00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.560\n>> You know, a lot of applications\nare starting to package in iCloud support.\n\n393\n00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.960\nAnd some of them do\na really good job with it.\n\n394\n00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.260\nAnd some of them do a poor job with it.\n\n395\n00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.980\nIt just kinda depends.\n\n396\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.020\nSome of them,\nit's as simple as account synchronization.\n\n397\n00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.630\nSo if I have Microsoft Outlook\ninstalled and I set it up for\n\n398\n00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:58.040\nmy email account, it can store that\naccount information in iCloud.\n\n399\n00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.630\nAnd so if I go to another Mac and\nI log in to my iCould account, and\n\n400\n00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.320\nI launch Outlook over there, I can already\nhave that same account configured.\n\n401\n00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.960\nMy account configuration is carried over,\nthat's great.\n\n402\n00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.270\nOther applications use iCloud storage.\n\n403\n00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.130\nIt's cloud storage.\n\n404\n00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:14.450\nI can save data to the iCloud, and\nwhen I go to any of my machines, my iPad,\n\n405\n00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.720\niPhone, Macbook, whatever,\nthey're all gonna see that storage and\n\n406\n00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.350\nhave access to my documents.\n\n407\n00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.550\nThat iCloud functionality which\nwas originally rolled out,\n\n408\n00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:22.360\nwas just kind of standalone.\n\n409\n00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.510\nIt was just by itself.\n\n410\n00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.840\nBut now it's actually getting\nintegrated into the applications.\n\n411\n00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.770\nSo when you run a program like pages or\n\n412\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.090\nnumbers, they default to\nwanting to save to iCloud.\n\n413\n00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.460\nOr when you fire up Microsoft Word it\nshows iCloud as a destination to save\n\n414\n00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.040\nyour data too.\n\n415\n00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.245\nSo they've got that functionality and\nthat support.\n\n416\n00:19:37.245 --> 00:19:40.160\nNow, in order to get it to work,\nwe've got to turn it on.\n\n417\n00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.690\nAnd I think I showed it\nin another episode but\n\n418\n00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.940\nlet's just through it\nagain here to see it.\n\n419\n00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:49.090\nIf I get back to my system preferences,\nwhoops, well, we'll go this way.\n\n420\n00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.930\nOnce I'm back into my system preferences,\n\n421\n00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.730\nyou've got your iCloud button\nright here that you can choose.\n\n422\n00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:54.960\nAnd when you click on that, you can go and\n\n423\n00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.290\nyou can attach an iCloud\naccount to your system.\n\n424\n00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:59.850\nNow I don't have to do it this way.\n\n425\n00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.500\nIf I do it this way, I get all\nthe various features of iCloud, so\n\n426\n00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.980\nthis is the way we normally want it.\n\n427\n00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.730\nBut if you just want your iCloud email and\ncalendar,\n\n428\n00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:13.130\nyou could go to Internet Accounts, and\nI could add my iCloud account here.\n\n429\n00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.850\nBut when you add it this way, it's really\ntrying add things like your email and\n\n430\n00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:17.560\nyour calendar,\n\n431\n00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.870\nnot necessarily some of the other\nthings like keychain synchronization.\n\n432\n00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.750\nSo if you want the full iCloud\nfunctionality and support, you'll come in\n\n433\n00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.930\nhere under iCloud and you'll login\nwith your Apple ID right here.\n\n434\n00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:33.540\nAnd here's the test of the day,\ndoes Don know his password?\n\n435\n00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.555\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which ironically is your password.\n\n436\n00:20:35.555 --> 00:20:37.550\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes it's just password all lowercase\n\n437\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.930\nthat way I could remember it.\n\n438\n00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.060\nBut once we get logged in,\nit's going to setup a lot of services.\n\n439\n00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.960\nAnd I'll actually see a little\nthing that'll pop-up and\n\n440\n00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.950\ntell me because it's going to\nsetup messages and Facetime.\n\n441\n00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:51.170\nIt's going to setup iCloud storage,\nkey change synchronization.\n\n442\n00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.430\nBack to my Mac, find my Mac,\nall these other different things.\n\n443\n00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.030\nAnd those are all pretty darn useful,\nright?\n\n444\n00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:01.430\nThe first part here, these are the\ncollaboration programs, so iCloud email,\n\n445\n00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:04.930\nwhich would be,\nif you have a me.com address or\n\n446\n00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:09.690\na .me address,\nwhatever that crazy thing is.\n\n447\n00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:10.705\nThe account nobody uses.\n\n448\n00:21:10.705 --> 00:21:14.460\n[LAUGH] I say that and\nnobody knows what it is.\n\n449\n00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.890\nThe email that Apple uses for free, you\ncontacts, your calendars, your reminders,\n\n450\n00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.490\nyour notes, and Safari, right?\n\n451\n00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.650\nAll of our bookmarks on Safari.\n\n452\n00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.200\nI use that feature all the time,\nit's really nice because I can\n\n453\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.400\nbookmark something on the desktop and\nthen it shows up on my cellphone.\n\n454\n00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.050\nI like having those bookmarks everywhere.\n\n455\n00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.850\nSo that kind of functionality,\nFind My Mac.\n\n456\n00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:33.590\nFind My Mac is really useful on an iPhone.\n\n457\n00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.300\nIf you ever lose your iPhone, you can use\nFind My Mac to locate your iPhone and\n\n458\n00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.210\nfigure out where it was.\n\n459\n00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.360\nIt reports GPS coordinates.\n\n460\n00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.710\nWell, your laptop can do the same thing.\n\n461\n00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.190\nIt's not always on like a cell-phone.\n\n462\n00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.540\nSo it's not as reliable, but it does work.\n\n463\n00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.030\nSo it's offering to turn that on.\n\n464\n00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.820\nSo I'll go ahead and turn that on.\n\n465\n00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.220\nNow, those aren't all the things.\n\n466\n00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.110\nThese are just some of\nthe default ones that we turn on.\n\n467\n00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.290\nAs soon as this is done,\nI'll see the full list of what we can do.\n\n468\n00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.130\nI'm gonna share my location.\n\n469\n00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.170\nMan, what's the password again?\n\n470\n00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.220\nIt's asking about my Keychain, right?\n\n471\n00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.880\nSo if I want to synchronize\nmy passwords across systems,\n\n472\n00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.000\nI can store them in a Keychain and\nshare the Keychain between my computers.\n\n473\n00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.330\nAnd so it needs a password for that which,\nagain, I should have a simpler password.\n\n474\n00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:15.900\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n475\n00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:16.530\n>> We'll punch that in.\n\n476\n00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.480\nBut you can see in the background,\niCloud drive.\n\n477\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.940\nI didn't see iCloud drive a minute ago.\n\n478\n00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.382\nGee whiz, how much do I have to do here.\n\n479\n00:22:24.382 --> 00:22:25.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n480\n00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:26.940\nas somebody who films videos,\n\n481\n00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.750\nlike I do, I've got multi-factor\nauthentication turned on.\n\n482\n00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.840\nSo if I want to authenticate\non this system,\n\n483\n00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.580\nI've got to provide a password,\nand a code.\n\n484\n00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:35.850\nThat's another advantage of iCloud.\n\n485\n00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:39.218\nWith a local account you don't have that,\nso there's an added layer of security.\n\n486\n00:22:39.218 --> 00:22:42.250\nI know there's probably at least one\nof you out there is thinking, boy,\n\n487\n00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.870\nDon's logging in with an actual\naccount here on the show.\n\n488\n00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:45.962\nIsn't that risky?\n\n489\n00:22:45.962 --> 00:22:47.890\nWell, I'll tell you two things.\n\n490\n00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:51.430\nOne, I don't worry about it so much\nbecause I have multifactor authentication\n\n491\n00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.720\nturned on, so\nyou'd have to have my code also.\n\n492\n00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:58.725\nAnd then two, this account that I am\nusing is actually registered as a child.\n\n493\n00:22:58.725 --> 00:23:00.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I have a family account and\n\n494\n00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:01.890\nthis is a child.\n\n495\n00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.320\nSo in order for purchases or\n\n496\n00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.830\nanything like that to happen,\nI would have to approve it.\n\n497\n00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.380\nSo I'm not too terribly worried about it,\nbut you\n\n498\n00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.690\nneed to take precautions with these cloud\naccounts cuz they can expose you to that.\n\n499\n00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.310\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\nI'll just do request approval.\n\n500\n00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.040\nAnd what that's gonna do is send\na message to my other devices\n\n501\n00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.100\nto make sure that it's approved.\n\n502\n00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.650\nAnd I can just login here\non my cell phone, and\n\n503\n00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.120\nI'll get that approval message\nhere in just a moment.\n\n504\n00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.020\nAnd I'll just be able to authorize\nthat and let the system in.\n\n505\n00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.840\nBut while I wait on that message to\nshow up, we can see what it's doing,\n\n506\n00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.810\niCloud Drive, there's that shared\nstorage that's being setup.\n\n507\n00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.730\nSo I can save something here and\nit'll show up on my other devices.\n\n508\n00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.020\nPhotos, right?\n\n509\n00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.630\nThe same thing really goes\nalong with the iCloud drive.\n\n510\n00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.810\nMail, contacts, calendars, reminders,\nthat's all my collaboration.\n\n511\n00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:43.270\nNotes are the same thing.\n\n512\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.140\nSafari is my web browser bookmarks.\n\n513\n00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.170\nThe Keychain I already talked about,\nthose are my passwords.\n\n514\n00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.859\nSee how that one's waiting for approval?\n\n515\n00:23:49.859 --> 00:23:54.577\nSo I'm waiting for that message to pop up\non my phone so I can say yes approve it or\n\n516\n00:23:54.577 --> 00:23:55.804\ndon't approve it.\n\n517\n00:23:55.804 --> 00:23:57.240\nIt still hasn't popped up on my phone.\n\n518\n00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.644\nSo we'll have to see what happens there.\n\n519\n00:23:59.644 --> 00:24:02.210\nFind My Mac, I talk about that one,\nwe can locate if we lose it.\n\n520\n00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.900\nAnd then Back to My Mac.\n\n521\n00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.330\nWhat is Back to My Mac?\n\n522\n00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:09.690\nWell, with Back to My Mac you\ncan go to the iCloud website and\n\n523\n00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:12.918\nyou can remotely view\nthe screen of your Mac.\n\n524\n00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:15.490\nSo I could be traveling,\nI could be at somebody else's office and\n\n525\n00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.810\nI want to go Back to My Mac to\nsee the screen and work on it.\n\n526\n00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:22.900\nI can check that and\nthat's gonna turn it on and\n\n527\n00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.790\nit's gonna turn on sharing of the machine.\n\n528\n00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.600\nAnd if I go into the details of this,\ntell me a little bit about it here.\n\n529\n00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.700\nSo it's gonna turn on\nthose sharing services.\n\n530\n00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.860\nAnd it's warning me here that my screen\nsharing is turned off, so let me go in and\n\n531\n00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.240\nturn that on real quick.\n\n532\n00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.600\nSo I'm gonna turn on screen sharing.\n\n533\n00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.390\nAnd it's on for\nadministrators of the system.\n\n534\n00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:39.780\nSo, that's exactly what I want.\n\n535\n00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.200\nYou need to turn on file sharing, too,\n\n536\n00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.730\nif you wanna use Back to My Mac\nto browse the hard drive.\n\n537\n00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:44.970\nSo I'll just turn that one on, too.\n\n538\n00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.940\nBut that should be enough for\nme to get that working.\n\n539\n00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.860\nAnd so now I've got all those\nservices configured and up and going.\n\n540\n00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.190\nAnd I can see on my iCloud storage,\n\n541\n00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:56.680\nI've got 4.99 GB available of\nmy 5 GB of iCloud storage.\n\n542\n00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.100\nI'm really not using it, right?\n\n543\n00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:03.570\nBut now that that's turned on,\nwhen I go into my Finder,\n\n544\n00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.010\nI've got my iCloud drive right here.\n\n545\n00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.850\nAnd I can put documents and\nfiles in there,\n\n546\n00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:12.982\nand they'll be there if I go to my iPhone,\nor my iPad, or whatever.\n\n547\n00:25:12.982 --> 00:25:14.340\nBecause it's stored in the Cloud.\n\n548\n00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.480\nIt's being shared and\nit's available there.\n\n549\n00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.700\nSo let's see if I can't find\nsomething to throw in there.\n\n550\n00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.160\nI guess I can just make a quick TextEdit.\n\n551\n00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.608\nSo I'll make another document, and I'm\ngonna save it in my iCloud Drive, right?\n\n552\n00:25:26.608 --> 00:25:29.354\nAnd I didn't show it, but it actually\ndefaulted to the iCloud Drive, so\n\n553\n00:25:29.354 --> 00:25:32.144\nit's trying to save there by default\nbecause it knows that I wanna store my\n\n554\n00:25:32.144 --> 00:25:32.925\nstuff in the Cloud.\n\n555\n00:25:35.906 --> 00:25:39.028\nAnd, whoop, where did TextEdit go?\n\n556\n00:25:39.028 --> 00:25:41.270\nAnd I lost my TextEdit.\n\n557\n00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:41.860\nCome on TextEdit.\n\n558\n00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.480\nThere we go.\nAll right.\n\n559\n00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.650\nSo we're gonna be going\nto the iCloud Drive.\n\n560\n00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:47.680\nI'm gonna create a new document.\n\n561\n00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.640\nAnd this is my document.\n\n562\n00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.620\nAnd we'll give it a quick Save command.\n\n563\n00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.280\nAnd I'll save it.\n\n564\n00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.580\nI'll call it My Document.\n\n565\n00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.755\nAnd it's gonna save it\ninto my iCloud Drive.\n\n566\n00:26:01.755 --> 00:26:02.970\nThat's exactly what I want.\n\n567\n00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:03.740\nAll right.\n\n568\n00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:09.510\nSo, once I do that, it's now saved and\nit's present right here on My Document.\n\n569\n00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:11.650\nAnd notice how TextEdit got a folder also.\n\n570\n00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.060\nTextEdit has its own\nstorage in iCloud Drive.\n\n571\n00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.730\nEach application can\ncreate its own storage.\n\n572\n00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:17.950\nOr you can just save it right to the root.\n\n573\n00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.510\nIt's a nice way to kind\nof organize things.\n\n574\n00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.291\nAnd I can make my own folders too, so\nif I just wanna say like Don's Stuff.\n\n575\n00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:25.770\nAnd I can put whatever I want in there.\n\n576\n00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.250\nIt's just a hard drive, right?\n\n577\n00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.303\nNow on another computer, if I'm on a Mac,\nI can sign into iCloud and\n\n578\n00:26:31.303 --> 00:26:33.241\nI'll have access to all of that stuff too.\n\n579\n00:26:33.241 --> 00:26:35.390\nIt'll synchronize down\nto the other machine.\n\n580\n00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:39.610\nBut even if I'm on Windows machine,\nI can go to icloud.com and\n\n581\n00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.530\nI can login on that website.\n\n582\n00:26:44.188 --> 00:26:46.420\nAnd I'll have access to most of that.\n\n583\n00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.850\nYou don't have access to everything.\n\n584\n00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:52.300\nLike I can't access my email if I've\nadded a third-party email account, right?\n\n585\n00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.720\nSo if I've added a Office\n365 account to Outlook,\n\n586\n00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.210\nI'm not gonna be able to\nget to that here in iCloud.\n\n587\n00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:03.550\nBut if it's my Apple account, then when I\nlog in, I will be able to access that and\n\n588\n00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.990\ngain access to my email,\nmy files, my other things.\n\n589\n00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:09.640\nSo once I get logged in, shoot,\nI haven't verified my identity, right?\n\n590\n00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.540\nI didn't get my approval\ncode on the phone.\n\n591\n00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.430\nSo say I've got a lock\non all these things.\n\n592\n00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.390\nI'm still not allowed to get to it, right?\n\n593\n00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:19.270\nSo let me just send a,\nthis'll do it by text message.\n\n594\n00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.690\nI'll definitely get that.\n\n595\n00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.110\nSo I'm gonna get a text\nmessage code any moment.\n\n596\n00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.380\nThere it is.\n\n597\n00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.150\nAnd I'll just punch that code in.\n\n598\n00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.976\nMine is 2651.\n\n599\n00:27:27.976 --> 00:27:31.728\nAnd I don't mind sharing that with the\nworld because if you were to try this now,\n\n600\n00:27:31.728 --> 00:27:33.390\nit's a one time use code.\n\n601\n00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.560\nI just used it once.\n\n602\n00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.270\nSo if somebody tries to log in again\nI'm gonna have to get a new code.\n\n603\n00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.990\nBut now everything's unlocked.\n\n604\n00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:42.520\nI can get to my mail,\nassuming that it's Apple's iCloud mail.\n\n605\n00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.400\nI can get to my Contacts, Calendars,\nPhotos, iCloud Drive, right?\n\n606\n00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.130\nSo if I click on iCloud Drive,\nit's gonna browse in there.\n\n607\n00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.490\nI'll see my files and folders.\n\n608\n00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.070\nAnd there they are.\n\n609\n00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.900\nThere's Don's Stuff and\nTextEdit and so on.\n\n610\n00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.250\nAnd I can go into my other applications,\nincluding Find my iPhone and so on.\n\n611\n00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:02.060\nAll right so\nI can start to leverage that stuff.\n\n612\n00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.650\nEven better, if I'm on a Mac and\n\n613\n00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:09.390\nI've logged into iCloud, then what I\ncan do is I can fire up the Finder.\n\n614\n00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.300\nAnd no matter where I am,\n\n615\n00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.630\nunder Shared I'll see my computers\nif I had Back to My Mac turned on.\n\n616\n00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:19.380\nThey'll show up right here and\nI can choose that machine.\n\n617\n00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.860\nAnd, so I've got DPLAPTOP here.\n\n618\n00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.520\nAnd so I can choose DPLAPTOP.\n\n619\n00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:28.110\nAnd I can hit Share Screen, and\nit'll connect to that remote system so\n\n620\n00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.160\nI can see its screen and work with it.\n\n621\n00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.040\nAnd it'll show up even if that\nmachine's on a different network\n\n622\n00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.840\nbecause it's synchronizing through\nApple servers, through iCloud.\n\n623\n00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.020\nSo those are all different\nfunctions of iCloud.\n\n624\n00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.372\nAnd their integrated into the OS and\n\n625\n00:28:41.372 --> 00:28:43.710\nthird-party vendors are starting\nto integrate that too.\n\n626\n00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:48.650\nSo when you fire up your next application,\nyou may see where it defaults to iCloud or\n\n627\n00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:50.980\nit wants to store its\napplication data in iCloud.\n\n628\n00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.376\nI use a little application called Jump\nDesktop to be able to remotely connect to\n\n629\n00:28:54.376 --> 00:28:55.718\nservers and things like that.\n\n630\n00:28:55.718 --> 00:28:58.063\nAnd it stores all its servers in iCloud.\n\n631\n00:28:58.063 --> 00:29:01.149\nAnd that's kinda nice because when I go\nto different computers I can have all my\n\n632\n00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:03.950\nservers defined right there to\nreach out and connect to them.\n\n633\n00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.810\nThat's the power of having\nsomething like iCloud.\n\n634\n00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:06.983\n>> Yeah that's very cool software, right?\n\n635\n00:29:06.983 --> 00:29:09.400\nAs we're moving into that\nwhole cloud-based world,\n\n636\n00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.572\nthat whole cloud-based environment,\nstart taking advantage of it.\n\n637\n00:29:12.572 --> 00:29:16.180\n[COUGH] Apple's been on this train for\nquite some time now so go ahead and\n\n638\n00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.902\nmake sure that you\nunderstand these things.\n\n639\n00:29:17.902 --> 00:29:19.940\nDon, you did a great\njob of explaining how,\n\n640\n00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.763\nthere was a lot on there I didn't\nknow we could leverage [LAUGH].\n\n641\n00:29:22.763 --> 00:29:24.120\nBut as iCloud user,\n\n642\n00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.750\nI might actually be a little more\nof an Apple fanboy than I realized.\n\n643\n00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.010\nThat being said,\n\n644\n00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:31.130\nI know you've got a whole lot more,\nas far as application support goes.\n\n645\n00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.933\nBut I'm looking at our clock.\n\n646\n00:29:31.933 --> 00:29:34.040\nOur time is dwindling down quickly.\n\n647\n00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.130\nSo it looks like we're\nheaded to part two land.\n\n648\n00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:37.540\n>> Yeah, yeah,\nwe've got some more things to cover.\n\n649\n00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.030\nAnd I do wanna clarify something.\n\n650\n00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:40.870\nI can't remember,\ncuz it's been more than two minutes.\n\n651\n00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.450\nWhen I was talking about Back, we talked\nabout Back to My Mac, where I can remotely\n\n652\n00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:48.490\nsee the screen, and we talked about\nFind My Mac, where you can locate it.\n\n653\n00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.720\nI can't remember which one I said\nyou could use in the iCloud website.\n\n654\n00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.320\nSo, let me just clarify that real quick.\n\n655\n00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.630\nWhen you go to the iCloud website,\nyou have Find My Mac.\n\n656\n00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.670\nAnd you can use Find My Mac to figure\nout where the heck the thing went.\n\n657\n00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.570\nSo, you can go to any computer in\nthe world, log in to the iCloud website,\n\n658\n00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:04.870\nand use Find My Mac to figure\nout where your Mac is.\n\n659\n00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:07.720\nBut Back to My Mac,\nthe remote screen sharing,\n\n660\n00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.840\nthat's actually not a part\nof the iCloud website.\n\n661\n00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.940\nYou have to do that from another Mac,\nyou gotta go to another Mac and\n\n662\n00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.640\nyou gotta log into iCloud and\nyou'll see it in the Finder.\n\n663\n00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.605\nSo Find My Mac is in the webpage.\n\n664\n00:30:18.605 --> 00:30:20.035\nBack to My Mac is in the Finder.\n\n665\n00:30:20.035 --> 00:30:22.395\nI'm not sure if I was clear\nthat when I said it earlier.\n\n666\n00:30:22.395 --> 00:30:24.215\nSo I just wanted to make\nsure I laid that out.\n\n667\n00:30:24.215 --> 00:30:24.790\n>> Nice save, Don.\n\n668\n00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:25.365\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nice save.\n\n669\n00:30:25.365 --> 00:30:26.105\nGood job.\n\n670\n00:30:26.105 --> 00:30:27.287\nAll right, well it looks like\nwe're headed, like I said,\n\n671\n00:30:27.287 --> 00:30:28.007\nwe're headed to the part two land.\n\n672\n00:30:28.007 --> 00:30:29.055\nWe'll see you there.\n\n673\n00:30:29.055 --> 00:30:30.425\nThanks for dropping by today.\n\n674\n00:30:30.425 --> 00:30:31.545\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n675\n00:30:31.545 --> 00:30:33.453\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITPro.TV.\n\n676\n00:30:33.453 --> 00:30:35.235\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n677\n00:30:35.235 --> 00:30:35.935\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n678\n00:30:35.935 --> 00:30:36.541\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n679\n00:30:36.541 --> 00:30:45.450\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:19.783\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in\ntoday's episode we're continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:19.783 --> 00:00:21.747\nour Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:21.747 --> 00:00:23.847\nAnd joining us back in\nthe studio today for\n\n6\n00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:27.340\na little more application support\nis our good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.400\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.020\nHow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.050\n>> It is going great, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.150\nThanks for having me back, and we're ready\nto dive into some neat technologies that\n\n11\n00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.390\nare kinda built into OS X that\na lot of people don't make use of.\n\n12\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.890\nSo it's kinda cool to talk about,\nand that is well, talking, right?\n\n13\n00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] We're gonna talk about talking.\n\n14\n00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.300\nSo when you work with your computer,\nright?\n\n15\n00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.600\nYour traditional way of interacting with\na computer is a keyboard and a mouse.\n\n16\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.770\nWe're starting to see new things,\nwe're starting to see touch screens and\n\n17\n00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.990\ntouch pads and all sorts of\ntouchy-feely stuff with your computers.\n\n18\n00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.550\nBut at the end of the day,\nit's a very tactile experience and\n\n19\n00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.160\na very visual experience.\n\n20\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.878\nWell, in the past, that hasn't worked\nout so well for people will visual or\n\n21\n00:01:02.878 --> 00:01:04.436\nauditory impairments.\n\n22\n00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:06.713\nSo it makes using the computer difficult,\n\n23\n00:01:06.713 --> 00:01:10.712\nand we've talked in other episodes\nabout accessibility features in OS X.\n\n24\n00:01:10.712 --> 00:01:14.782\nThere's a lot of stuff that helps make the\noperating system more accessible to people\n\n25\n00:01:14.782 --> 00:01:16.960\nwho have various impairments.\n\n26\n00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.050\nWell there's actually some of these\nfeatures that have started making it into\n\n27\n00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.920\nthe mainstream, things like text\nto speech and speech to text.\n\n28\n00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.170\nThese are two that are becoming really,\n\n29\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.020\nreally common place and you see it\nmore in the mobile devices, right.\n\n30\n00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.980\nSo if you have an iPhone or\nan iPad you've got Siri.\n\n31\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.390\nAnd Siri, when you receive a text message,\nshe can read it out to you.\n\n32\n00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.900\nOr you can ask her a question and\nshe'll answer you.\n\n33\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.300\nYou can tell her a message to text and\nshe'll send it.\n\n34\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.170\nShe's taking text on the phone,\nand speaking it to you.\n\n35\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.540\nText to speech.\n\n36\n00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.130\nAnd you're giving her commands,\nand she's turning those into text.\n\n37\n00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.380\nThat's speech to text.\n\n38\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.400\nThat's moving into the desktop world also.\n\n39\n00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.840\nSo in OS X, on your MacBook, your MacPro,\n\n40\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.970\nwhatever, you've got that\nsame type of functionality.\n\n41\n00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.070\nNow it's not exactly the same.\n\n42\n00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.410\nSiri is really powerful, and\nApples put a lot of work in that.\n\n43\n00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.870\nThe functionality on OS X,\nis not at that same level.\n\n44\n00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.950\nSo it's a much more basic one.\n\n45\n00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.600\nIt's more like the predecessor to Siri.\n\n46\n00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.850\nI wouldn't be surprised if we see\nSiri like functionality introduced\n\n47\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.940\ninto OS X before too long.\n\n48\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.860\nBut for right now we gotta deal with some\nof these features that are really just\n\n49\n00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.332\nslightly evolved from the accessibility\nfeatures that we had years ago.\n\n50\n00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:27.570\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at these and\n\n51\n00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.690\nwe'll start with text to speech, right.\n\n52\n00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.540\nIf you have a visual impairment,\nwhen you go to use a computer,\n\n53\n00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.040\nthere's a lot of text on there and\na lot of it's very small.\n\n54\n00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.100\nAnd it can be very difficult to read.\n\n55\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.150\nAnd so if you have a visual impairment,\n\n56\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.060\nyou've got a find a way\nto work around that.\n\n57\n00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.180\nThe other thing is,\nthe artsy creative types over at Apple.\n\n58\n00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.380\nThey come up with these new themes and\nthese ways of laying things out.\n\n59\n00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.710\nTheir current trend is light\ngray text on a white background.\n\n60\n00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.660\nI absolutely hate it.\n\n61\n00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.880\nIt's the worst thing in the world.\n\n62\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.970\nThere's very little contrast to it.\n\n63\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.490\nIt's hard.\n\n64\n00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.870\nEven without a visual impairment,\nit is hard to read that kind of text.\n\n65\n00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.510\nI mean you just have to go to Apple's\nwebsite to see this all over the place.\n\n66\n00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.730\nOr right here in the address bar\nof Safari is a great example.\n\n67\n00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.040\nIn light gray text, on a white background,\nsearch or enter a website name.\n\n68\n00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.750\nAnd it's a little on the small side,\nisn't it?\n\n69\n00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.400\nRight.\nI mean it's tough to see that and\n\n70\n00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.240\nI'm actually using one of\nthe accessibility features right here.\n\n71\n00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.380\nI'm using the zoom function.\n\n72\n00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.810\nSo it'll zoom in just so I can read it and\nI don't have visual impairment,\n\n73\n00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.150\nI mean I have contact lenses,\nthat doesn't really count.\n\n74\n00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.960\nAnd it's hard for me to read.\n\n75\n00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:45.440\nSo imagine if you had tunnel vision or\nwhat is it, ocular degeneration?\n\n76\n00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.630\nOne of those various symptoms.\n\n77\n00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.600\nGlaucoma.\n\n78\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.550\nAnything that impairs your vision.\n\n79\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.950\nOr clinical blindness.\n\n80\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.750\nYou just can't see then this\nabsolutely doesn't do any good for you.\n\n81\n00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.140\nSo what text to speech does is it\ntakes these elements on the screen and\n\n82\n00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.440\nit reads them out to you.\n\n83\n00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.789\nAnd so that functionality, Apple calls\nthat voice over, but voice over,\n\n84\n00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:11.190\nit was originally designed\nas an accessibility feature.\n\n85\n00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.013\nBut over time they pulled\nit out of accessibility and\n\n86\n00:04:14.013 --> 00:04:15.819\njust made it a standard feature.\n\n87\n00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.421\nSo text to speech because we have\nthings like Siri that's reading to us\n\n88\n00:04:20.421 --> 00:04:24.640\nour notifications, or\nour text messages, or whatever.\n\n89\n00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.750\nSo people are using it\nbeyond accessibility.\n\n90\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.780\nSo if we wanna configure this,\nif you wanna configure text to speech,\n\n91\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.610\nthere's two different places you can go.\n\n92\n00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.420\nIf I go into my system preferences,\n\n93\n00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.310\nwhat you'll notice is way down\nhere we've got accessibility.\n\n94\n00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.272\nIn older versions of Mac OS\nthat's where all this was.\n\n95\n00:04:40.272 --> 00:04:43.610\nBut now I've also dictation and speech.\n\n96\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.070\nAnd the dictation and speech side,\n\n97\n00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.880\nthis has the text to speech functionality\nthat's designed for everyone, but\n\n98\n00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.130\nthen we can go into accessibility and\nget to the really advanced features.\n\n99\n00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.930\nThe ones that are useful for\n\n100\n00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.980\npeople that have a true impairment that\njust need the system to be easier to use.\n\n101\n00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.690\nNow for the common person who just\nwants to be able to have text read\n\n102\n00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.260\nout to them right?\n\n103\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.515\nSo I get a notification on my screen and\nit reads it out to me.\n\n104\n00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.090\nThere's not a whole lot that I need\nto configure for that to work.\n\n105\n00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.830\nFirst off I've got to pick a voice.\n\n106\n00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.790\nThe default voice in Mac OS is Alex.\n\n107\n00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.520\nSo Alex is our default voice.\n\n108\n00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.650\nAnd if I play that in my virtual\nmachine it is a little quiet.\n\n109\n00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.170\nLet me do it on my regular desktop.\n\n110\n00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.830\nSo I'm going go into my system preferences\nand go into text to speech and\n\n111\n00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.050\nI'll pick old Alex right there.\n\n112\n00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.230\nAnd let's listen to\na sample of Alex talking.\n\n113\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.360\n>> Most people recognize me by my voice.\n\n114\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.870\n>> All right.\n\n115\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.750\nSo the voice, it's a pretty good voice.\n\n116\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.060\nIt's robotic, you can tell the inflection,\nthe flow is not quite right.\n\n117\n00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.110\nIt's not perfect by any means.\n\n118\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.920\nBut it's pretty passable.\n\n119\n00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.000\nYou could listen to that, and\nit wouldn't be too terribly inconvenient.\n\n120\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.352\nThese types of voices\nare very difficult to create.\n\n121\n00:05:50.352 --> 00:05:54.789\nAnd so Apple has packaged a few with OS X\nand I think Daniel and I both agree,\n\n122\n00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.307\nAlex is probably [CROSSTALK] the best one.\n\n123\n00:05:57.307 --> 00:05:58.362\n>> By far, yeah.\n\n124\n00:05:58.362 --> 00:06:00.170\n[LAUGH]\n>> If you listen to some of\n\n125\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.680\nthe other ones, like Bruce, and\n\n126\n00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.820\nFred, these are some other male voices\nthat are included with the system.\n\n127\n00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.190\n>> I sure like being inside\nthis fancy computer.\n\n128\n00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.820\nThat one's.\n\n129\n00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.780\n>> That's fantastic right there.\n\n130\n00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.780\n>> Even more robotic.\n\n131\n00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.390\nFred's not so bad.\n\n132\n00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.620\n>> What's it like being\ninside this fancy computer?\n\n133\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.380\n>> Kinda like Stephen Hawking's chair,\nright?\n\n134\n00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.710\n>> Yeah.\n>> Sounds very similar to his.\n\n135\n00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.560\n>> That is very similar.\n\n136\n00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.986\nYeah, that, so\nyou can re-create 1970s technology.\n\n137\n00:06:21.986 --> 00:06:24.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you want.\n\n138\n00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.690\nBut there's female voices also.\n\n139\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.700\nAnd I'll be honest with you,\nthese are even worse.\n\n140\n00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.190\nSo if we take, like Kathy.\n\n141\n00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.940\n>> Isn't it nice to have\na computer who will talk to you?\n\n142\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.550\n>> That's almost unintelligible [LAUGH].\n\n143\n00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.260\nLet's be honest.\n\n144\n00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.290\n>> Yeah that's pretty bad.\n\n145\n00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.240\nAnd you can tweak the speed.\n\n146\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.350\nSo I can make them speak faster or slower.\n\n147\n00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.150\nIf I'm just having it read to me\nnotifications I probably want it at\n\n148\n00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.370\na normal speed.\n\n149\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.120\nBut if I have a visual impairment and\nI'm trying to determine all the different\n\n150\n00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.960\nelements that are on the screen I\nprobably want it to be a lot faster.\n\n151\n00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.965\nAnd so you can speed that up to move\nthrough the screen more quickly.\n\n152\n00:06:53.965 --> 00:06:55.057\nAnd some of the voices,\n\n153\n00:06:55.057 --> 00:06:58.558\nlike Vicki are actually designed to go\na little bit faster, so I speed it up.\n\n154\n00:06:58.558 --> 00:07:01.401\n>> [INAUDIBLE].\n\n155\n00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:03.170\n>> And see how that was.\n\n156\n00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.500\nThe inflection's not great,\nbut she was able to read fast.\n\n157\n00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.550\nIt was very intelligible, which is kind\nof what that was designed for, and\n\n158\n00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.520\nthat works out very well.\n\n159\n00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.380\nShe's actually somewhat\npainful at normal speed.\n\n160\n00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.130\n>> It must be nice to have\na computer that will talk to you.\n\n161\n00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.850\n>> it's almost like this one\nis designed to be done faster.\n\n162\n00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.060\nSo you can tweak these to get them\nkind of set the way that you want and\n\n163\n00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.110\nget it in place.\n\n164\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.475\nNow we've got the option here to\nannounce when alerts are displayed.\n\n165\n00:07:24.475 --> 00:07:28.254\nSo if an alert pops up on my screen,\nit will automatically read it out.\n\n166\n00:07:28.254 --> 00:07:31.612\nAnd so if you've got messages set up and\nyou're doing the unity feature where\n\n167\n00:07:31.612 --> 00:07:34.969\na text message comes in on your cell phone\nand it shows up on your desktop also,\n\n168\n00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:37.733\nit can read out that text message\nto you while you're working.\n\n169\n00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:39.517\nYou don't even have to\nswitch your applications.\n\n170\n00:07:39.517 --> 00:07:43.986\nThen you can set your alert options in\nhere to figure out what voice it's gonna\n\n171\n00:07:43.986 --> 00:07:48.523\nuse as well as the application name that\nit's gonna say when it starts to talk,\n\n172\n00:07:48.523 --> 00:07:49.859\nwhat's it gonna say?\n\n173\n00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:50.630\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n174\n00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.451\n>> Read that out, you can kind of\npick how it's gonna pronounce that.\n\n175\n00:07:54.451 --> 00:07:56.284\nSo you got some options right there.\n\n176\n00:07:56.284 --> 00:08:00.150\nYou can also set a manual way for\nit to read the text.\n\n177\n00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.970\nInstead of just having it\nautomatically trigger,\n\n178\n00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.990\nI can have it where I highlight text and\nthen hit a button and it will read it out.\n\n179\n00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.260\nAnd the default key is Option+Esc and\nyou see where you can change that key.\n\n180\n00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.030\nIf you want to switch it to something\nelse, you can certainly do that and\n\n181\n00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.030\nit will read it, all right?\n\n182\n00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.650\nSo if I were to fire up\na program like TextEdit, and\n\n183\n00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.240\nlet me just whip up a new document here.\n\n184\n00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:25.490\nAnd we type in a message like,\nDaniel, you are fired, right?\n\n185\n00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:30.300\nMaybe I don't wanna have that conversation\nwith Daniel in person for obvious reasons,\n\n186\n00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.980\nthen I might wanna let\nthe computer do it for me, right?\n\n187\n00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.411\nSo we can go ahead and\ndo that, and hit Option+Esc.\n\n188\n00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:34.549\n>> It's like Back To the Future 2.\n\n189\n00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:35.442\n>> You are fired.\n\n190\n00:08:35.442 --> 00:08:38.077\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let the computer do it.\n\n191\n00:08:38.077 --> 00:08:38.693\n>> Yeah.\n\n192\n00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.500\n>> But\nyou can certainly have some fun with it.\n\n193\n00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.940\nBut you can also use this for\nvery practical purposes, right?\n\n194\n00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.890\nText to speech is incredibly useful.\n\n195\n00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.900\nOne example that I have is I\nlove to listen to audiobooks.\n\n196\n00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.950\nWhen I drive, so when I drive to work or\n\n197\n00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.760\ndrive down the interstate, you can listen\nto music, but I read a ton of books.\n\n198\n00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.590\nI love to read.\n\n199\n00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.160\nAnd I'd love to do that while I drive but\nI can't, right?\n\n200\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.030\nSo I use text to speech to take books,\nbook that I purchase as EPUBs or\n\n201\n00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.910\nwhatever, PDFs.\n\n202\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.470\nAnd it will read those out loud to me.\n\n203\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.930\nSo now I can be driving down\nthe interstate and reading a book.\n\n204\n00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.620\nYou know sometimes books have an audiobook\nform, but a lot of them don't,\n\n205\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.100\nespecially technical manuals.\n\n206\n00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.430\nSo I'll have the robot voice reading\nto me a technical manual, and\n\n207\n00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.250\nthat's part of how I learn these things.\n\n208\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.260\nSo that stuff,\nI've listened to literally thousands of\n\n209\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.226\nhours of text being read through\na text to speech engine like this.\n\n210\n00:09:29.226 --> 00:09:31.790\nThe secret is not so much the technology,\n\n211\n00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.650\nthe technology is great,\nthe secret is finding a voice you like.\n\n212\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.040\nYou've gotta find a voice.\n\n213\n00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.350\nAnd the six default voices that\nare built in, they're okay.\n\n214\n00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.900\nBut, if you're gonna use this a lot\nI encourage you to go out there,\n\n215\n00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.090\nthere's third-party providers that you can\nfind that have created customized voices\n\n216\n00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.660\nthat are very smooth.\n\n217\n00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.210\nSome of them are extremely realistic, and\nboy, they really make a big difference and\n\n218\n00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.060\nthey make it a lot more\nof a pleasant experience.\n\n219\n00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.544\n>> I want Morgan Freeman\nto read books to me, right?\n\n220\n00:09:56.544 --> 00:09:57.587\n[LAUGH]\n>> I wonder if somebody has a [CROSSTALK].\n\n221\n00:09:57.587 --> 00:09:59.560\nThat would be awesome.\n\n222\n00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.730\nAll right, so that's kind of\nthe regular end users exposure.\n\n223\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.100\nLet's talk about if you\nactually have an impairment.\n\n224\n00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.260\nThere are are some really advanced\nfunctions that are available in here.\n\n225\n00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.680\nSo, if I go back to my system preferences,\n\n226\n00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.870\nwhat we were looking at were\njust these basic options and\n\n227\n00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.308\nthen right down here at the bottom\nyou've got change VoiceOver settings.\n\n228\n00:10:17.308 --> 00:10:20.910\nNow I called this VoiceOver earlier and\nif you look at this screen\n\n229\n00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.290\nwhen it's talking about text to speech\nit doesn't call a VoiceOver right.\n\n230\n00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.100\nVoiceOver is the name of the actual\naccessibility feature but\n\n231\n00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.610\nit's all powered by VoiceOver in the exam\nthey'll always refer to as VoiceOver.\n\n232\n00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:35.150\nAnd so is I go into Accessibility,\nnow I can find VoiceOver and\n\n233\n00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:36.190\nI can tweak the settings,\n\n234\n00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:41.040\nbut there's not a whole lot here, just\nenable VoiceOver, well what does that do?\n\n235\n00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.070\nYou can use this check mark or\nyou can just hit Cmd+F5, and\n\n236\n00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:47.870\nwhat it does is it tells the system to\nstart reading every element on the screen.\n\n237\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.060\nNow I'm gonna turn it on for\na second and you'll see,\n\n238\n00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.850\nI've got a lot of elements on my screen.\n\n239\n00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.870\nSo it's gonna start telling\nme what I'm looking at,\n\n240\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.700\nwhat I'm doing, so when I click Enable.\n\n241\n00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.140\n>> Welcome to OS X, VoiceOver is on.\n\n242\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.060\nSystem preferences, Accessibility,\nWindow accessibility features,\n\n243\n00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.410\nTable, VoiceOver, VoiceOver image.\n\n244\n00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.250\nSelective has keyboard focus.\n\n245\n00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.590\nYou are currently on a table.\n\n246\n00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.350\nTo enter this table,\npress Ctrl+Option+Shift+down arrow.\n\n247\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.540\n>> Okay.\n\n248\n00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.980\nSo it let me know the window I was in.\n\n249\n00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.020\nIt let me know I was in\nSystem Preferences and Accessibility.\n\n250\n00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.280\nIt let me know that I was currently\nclicked inside of this table and\n\n251\n00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.100\nthat VoiceOver had focus.\n\n252\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.895\nAnd that if I want to navigate\nthe table I could hit, I think it was,\n\n253\n00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:27.700\nCmd+Shift+Option and down arrow or\nsomething like that.\n\n254\n00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.580\nOr whatever sequence it just told me,\ncuz apparently I wasn't paying attention.\n\n255\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.440\nThen I can hit that and now I can\nstart to navigate through this table.\n\n256\n00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.760\nI don't have to use my mouse because\nif I have a visual impairment,\n\n257\n00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.190\nI'm gonna have a hard time\nfinding where to click, right?\n\n258\n00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.940\nBut, if I can hit a keyboard\nshortcut to move up or down,\n\n259\n00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.630\nthen I can stat to navigate this.\n\n260\n00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:46.390\nAnd, as I click on different things,\nit's gonna tell me what I'm doing.\n\n261\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.975\nAnd, as my mouse changes focus, so\nfor example, if I click on zoom.\n\n262\n00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:50.810\n>> Zoom, zoom image.\n\n263\n00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.820\n>> It tells me that I've\nnow highlighted Zoom.\n\n264\n00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.430\nAnd as we move forward and\n\n265\n00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:56.810\nstart doing this-\n>> System off.\n\n266\n00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.140\n>> This is probably not the best example.\n\n267\n00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:58.950\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Table.\n>> There we go.\n\n268\n00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.770\n>> Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom,\nuncheck checkbox.\n\n269\n00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.210\nYou are currently on a checkbox.\n\n270\n00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.450\nTo select or deselect this checkbox.\n\n271\n00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.120\n>> If it will let me\nget a word in edgewise.\n\n272\n00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.230\n>> Very verbose.\n\n273\n00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.102\n>> I can hit Tab to move around\nthrough the screen elements, but\n\n274\n00:12:10.102 --> 00:12:12.989\nif I can't see that I don't\nknow what I've tabbed to right?\n\n275\n00:12:12.989 --> 00:12:15.760\nSo every time I hit Tab it's gonna\nread to me what I'm now highlighting.\n\n276\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.540\n>> Use scroll gesture with modifier\nkeys to zoom, check checkbox.\n\n277\n00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.010\n>> And-\n>> You are currently on a checkbox.\n\n278\n00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.590\nTo select or deselect this checkbox,\npress Ctrl+Option+Space.\n\n279\n00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.430\n>> There we go so\n\n280\n00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.050\nyou can see how it's helping me\nthrough this, through text to speech.\n\n281\n00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.370\nIt's reading to me what's on the screen so\nthat I don't have to see it and\n\n282\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.880\nI can just use a keyboard to interact.\n\n283\n00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.070\nSo that's one example.\n\n284\n00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:36.020\nI'm gonna-\n>> VoiceOver off.\n\n285\n00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.700\n>> I'm just gonna turn VoiceOver off so\nit doesn't keep talking.\n\n286\n00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.690\nBut if I go back to VoiceOver\nthere's even more that we can do.\n\n287\n00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.950\nYou have this thing called\nthe VoiceOver utility, and\n\n288\n00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.440\nthe VoiceOver utility is powerful.\n\n289\n00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.920\nWe can jump in there and\nreally tweak what VoiceOver does.\n\n290\n00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.330\nSo you see some of the basic things,\nlike do we say a welcome message.\n\n291\n00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.640\nAnd what is that welcome message\nwhen it starts to do VoiceOver?\n\n292\n00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.860\nAnd then you can set up some\nother preferences and options.\n\n293\n00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.840\nYou can allow it to be\ncontrolled by AppleScript.\n\n294\n00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.540\nYou can also do the verbosity.\n\n295\n00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.180\nHow detailed do I want it to be\nabout what text is on the screen?\n\n296\n00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.790\nCuz it can summarize,\nit can just read the big headers.\n\n297\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.770\nYou can configure other speech\noptions like what voice.\n\n298\n00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.390\nIt's using Alex here by default.\n\n299\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.625\nWell the default's actually Vicki,\nI've changed to Alex cuz Vicki's annoying.\n\n300\n00:13:14.625 --> 00:13:16.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you can pick which one you want.\n\n301\n00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.900\nThe voices are right here\njust like the system side.\n\n302\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.860\nYou can define how you wanna navigate.\n\n303\n00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.100\nSo you can set up Keyboard-Based\nNavigation that VoiceOver is aware of.\n\n304\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.600\nYou can define how it interact with web\npages cuz you've got tabs and page loading\n\n305\n00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.180\nand also to other information, our sound,\nour visuals and even on the Braille side.\n\n306\n00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.680\nIf you have a Braille monitor\nattached to your computer.\n\n307\n00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.220\nThat's a Tactile Monitor that you can hook\nup and any text on the screen appears\n\n308\n00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.610\ndynamically generated is\nBraille on the Braille Monitor.\n\n309\n00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.260\nThose things are really impressive.\n\n310\n00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.470\nI don't have a visual impairment but\nI've worked with people who do and\n\n311\n00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.310\nthey've told me that, hey,\n\n312\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.380\nwhen you get used to it, when you\nlearn how to use that Braille Monitor.\n\n313\n00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.330\nIt is way faster than waiting for some\nvoice to read things out on the computer.\n\n314\n00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.440\nAnd so now,\nthey can have a really quick experience.\n\n315\n00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.650\nBut they can combine it with VoiceOver and\nget the best of both worlds, so\n\n316\n00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.570\nthey've got the Braille\nmonitor as well as VoiceOver.\n\n317\n00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.780\nSo for simple small bits of\ntext VoiceOver can do it.\n\n318\n00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.680\nBut then when they're reading a big\ndocument, they can go to that Braille\n\n319\n00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.360\nmonitor and they can read way faster and\nget to that information.\n\n320\n00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.120\nSo all different\nfunctionalities of VoiceOver.\n\n321\n00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.310\nRemember for the exam,\nthat VoiceOver is text to speech.\n\n322\n00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:26.190\nYou've got text on the screen and\nOS X is reading it out to you out loud.\n\n323\n00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:30.608\nIt's turning what would be a visual\nexperience into an auditory experience.\n\n324\n00:14:30.608 --> 00:14:34.288\nAll right, but\nwhat about the other way around, right?\n\n325\n00:14:34.288 --> 00:14:38.237\nThe other way around is I\ntalk to the computer and\n\n326\n00:14:38.237 --> 00:14:42.110\nit turns it into text, speech to text.\n\n327\n00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.020\nAnd that's voice dictation.\n\n328\n00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.980\nVoice dictation, it originally came\nabout as an accessibility feature.\n\n329\n00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.410\nA way for somebody who couldn't\nnecessarily type on the keyboard or\n\n330\n00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.830\nuse the mouse to be able\nto still use the computer.\n\n331\n00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:59.780\nAnd the example I get is, one of the more\npopular ones is like Parkinson's disease.\n\n332\n00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.140\nIf you have Parkinson's disease,\n\n333\n00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.160\nyour motor control on your hands\nreally starts to break down.\n\n334\n00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.990\nSame thing with like multiple sclerosis or\nother, any kind of\n\n335\n00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.980\nmuscular degeneration where you just don't\nhave the fine motor control of your hands.\n\n336\n00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.610\nIf you've got that it is\ninsanely difficult to type.\n\n337\n00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.990\nYou'll spend more time correcting typos\nthan you will actually typing and\n\n338\n00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.370\nthen using your computer becomes\na very frustrating experience.\n\n339\n00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.140\nSpeech to text tries to solve that.\n\n340\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:30.300\nIt solves it by allowing you not to\ntype on the keyboard but to just talk.\n\n341\n00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.960\nYou can talk to the computer and\nit'll type it out.\n\n342\n00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.700\nNow, when I say dictation, I always think\nof like, I'm going to write the next great\n\n343\n00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.690\nAmerican novel, and I'm just going\nto tell it to the computer and\n\n344\n00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.275\nthe computer will sit there and\ntype it out like a secretary, right.\n\n345\n00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:45.334\nSo, it was the best of times,\nit was the worst of times, and\n\n346\n00:15:45.334 --> 00:15:48.286\nit starts to write that out and\nI get sued for plagiarism.\n\n347\n00:15:48.286 --> 00:15:51.658\nI can say the computer did it, not me.\n\n348\n00:15:51.658 --> 00:15:53.771\nSo that's one way of using it.\n\n349\n00:15:53.771 --> 00:15:56.900\nBut with OS X, you can actually use it for\nvoice commands.\n\n350\n00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.360\nYou can tell it to do things and\nit will perform those actions.\n\n351\n00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.420\nSo now it's not really voice to text.\n\n352\n00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.740\nIt's voice to command.\n\n353\n00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.750\nIt's giving orders to the system.\n\n354\n00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.650\n>> It's Star Trek time at that point.\n\n355\n00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.170\n>> Yeah, it's like in a Star Trek\nmovie where Scotty says computer, and\n\n356\n00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.720\nhe goes to tell it to do something.\n\n357\n00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.330\nIt's kind of like that,\nand we can speak with it.\n\n358\n00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.940\nThis is the technology that led to Siri,\nso\n\n359\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.970\na lot of you guys have used Siri on your\niPhone or iPad, and you talk to Siri.\n\n360\n00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.790\nYou ask her questions,\nand she gives you answers.\n\n361\n00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.520\nYou tell her to do things like, hey,\nnavigate to work, and she maps it out and\n\n362\n00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.700\ngets the map fired up and\ngets all that done.\n\n363\n00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.360\nThat is voice to text.\n\n364\n00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.260\nYou're telling her a command,\nshe's converting it to text and\n\n365\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.950\nthen performing that action.\n\n366\n00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.480\nWell we don't have Siri in OS ten,\nbut it's kinda close.\n\n367\n00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.860\nWe can tell it to do certain things, and\n\n368\n00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.140\nespecially when it comes to typing\ndocuments and emails it's pretty handy.\n\n369\n00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.760\nAll right let me show you how this works.\n\n370\n00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.470\nI'm gonna jump over to my virtual machine.\n\n371\n00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.780\nThis is a stock install at El Capitan,\n\n372\n00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:56.920\nand when I go to dictation, you'll\nnotice that dictation is off my default.\n\n373\n00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.370\nSo when I go this screen dictation is set\nto off, and it's testing my microphone.\n\n374\n00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.250\nSee how it's moving because I'm talking?\n\n375\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.010\nIt's picking me up,\nit knows that I'm talking,\n\n376\n00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.850\nit's showing that my\nmicrophone is working.\n\n377\n00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.880\nIf I had more than one\nmicrophone I can pick it.\n\n378\n00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.890\nMaybe I've got a headset that has\na microphone, and I could choose that.\n\n379\n00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.690\nBut if I stop talking,\nthat will stop moving.\n\n380\n00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.230\nAnd so it's a good test to let us\nknow that microphone is working.\n\n381\n00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:23.400\nAnd after that the only real option I\nhave is to turn it on, and that's it.\n\n382\n00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.440\nWell, when you turn it on,\na lot of different things happen.\n\n383\n00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.210\nFIrst off, it starts listening for\nyour language, right?\n\n384\n00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:33.720\nIf we need to pick our language,\nif I'm English or French or whatever, it\n\n385\n00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.800\nneeds to know the language you're speaking\nso they can do the proper recognition.\n\n386\n00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.980\nDifferent languages have\ndifferent requirements.\n\n387\n00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.420\nThe other thing is, it's not always on.\n\n388\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.090\nIt's not always listening to what you do.\n\n389\n00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.760\nYou have to turn it on when you need it.\n\n390\n00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.600\nThe default is,\nthere's a simple shortcut key.\n\n391\n00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.780\nYou just tap the function key\ntwice on your keyboard and\n\n392\n00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.910\nthen it starts listening.\n\n393\n00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.440\nYou tell it a command and it does it.\n\n394\n00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.890\nOr, you tell it a sentence and it does it.\n\n395\n00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.990\nSo, easy to turn that on and you can\nchange that to different things, so\n\n396\n00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.230\nif you want to change it to another\nkeyboard shortcut, you certainly can.\n\n397\n00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:07.180\nNow when I turn it on,\nit's gonna offer to run in enhanced mode,\n\n398\n00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.810\nthe standard mode works okay, right?\n\n399\n00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.430\nYou talk to it,\nit tries to figure out what you're doing,\n\n400\n00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.290\nif you've got an accent, if you've got any\nkind of variation from standard speech,\n\n401\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.430\nit's not gonna work very well.\n\n402\n00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.800\nBut enhanced mode\nEnhancement will download\n\n403\n00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.210\nabout 1.2 gigabytes of data from\nApple's website down to your computer.\n\n404\n00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.410\nAnd once it's downloaded,\nnow when you talk,\n\n405\n00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.890\nit's able to run your voice against\nthese massive signatures, and\n\n406\n00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.580\nit's far more accurate, and\nit's got far more commands supported.\n\n407\n00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.230\nIt's much more powerful, so\nyou wanna do this, right?\n\n408\n00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.018\nIf you wanna do it,\nwhy isn't it included by default?\n\n409\n00:18:38.018 --> 00:18:41.470\nWell, it's 1.2 gigs in size.\n\n410\n00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.310\nWhen you install OS ten,\nit's less than ten gigs.\n\n411\n00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:48.210\nThis would be ten percent of\nthe size of the OS X install itself.\n\n412\n00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:53.090\nAnd if you've only got like a 128 gig SSD\nin your laptop, space is at a premium.\n\n413\n00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.850\nSo you don't want to waste it, and\nthat's why it's not done by default.\n\n414\n00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.620\nIf I hit enable, it's going to\nstart downloading from Apple.\n\n415\n00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.190\nSo I can hit enable and\n\n416\n00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:03.840\nit's going to reach out to them and,\nwell I say it's going to do it.\n\n417\n00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.550\nThere it goes.\n\n418\n00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.780\nPreparing to download.\n\n419\n00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.930\nI had to hit use enhanced.\n\n420\n00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:11.430\nSo now it's downloading and it's going to\nstart reaching out and getting that data.\n\n421\n00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.070\nOkay.\n\n422\n00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:17.120\nNow that's important because I'm not going\nto have enhanced mode until it actually\n\n423\n00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.770\nfinishes downloading, right.\n\n424\n00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.900\nOtherwise it's going to keep downloading\nand it's got seven minutes remaining.\n\n425\n00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.550\nLet me turn that off.\n\n426\n00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.400\nI'm gonna turn that off cuz I've already\ngot it downloaded on my desktop.\n\n427\n00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.100\nSo let me just switch over to my\nregular desktop and we'll see it here.\n\n428\n00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:33.897\nSo on my desktop,\nif I go into my System Preferences and\n\n429\n00:19:33.897 --> 00:19:38.780\nDictation & Speech, and\nI go up to Dictation, I can turn it on,\n\n430\n00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.910\nmine's already on, and I'm already\nusing that enhanced dictation mode.\n\n431\n00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.930\nIt's already downloaded the files.\n\n432\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.840\nIt's ready to rock, okay.\n\n433\n00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.270\nWell, we'll see this thing in action.\n\n434\n00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.330\nI'm gonna fire up text edit.\n\n435\n00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.500\nAnd let me bump this up to a larger font\nsize so we'll all be able to see it.\n\n436\n00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.560\nAnd let's test it out.\n\n437\n00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.870\nThe way you use it is you just\ntap that function key twice and\n\n438\n00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.320\nthen you can just start reading to it.\n\n439\n00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.988\nSo, if I wanna tell it\nsomething like [SOUND],\n\n440\n00:20:07.988 --> 00:20:10.678\nthis is my document.\n\n441\n00:20:10.678 --> 00:20:11.820\nThere is goes.\n\n442\n00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.380\nRight?\nSo\n\n443\n00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.000\nnow it's listening to me and\nit's typing out what I'm saying.\n\n444\n00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.290\nNow, notice I'm talking and\nit's not typing.\n\n445\n00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.430\nWell, the reason is I'm just going on and\non and on and it's trying to sort it out.\n\n446\n00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.270\nAnd if I would just shut up for a second,\nthen it would start to type it out.\n\n447\n00:20:29.765 --> 00:20:30.710\nThere we go.\n\n448\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.470\nAnd so it's getting a little\nupset at me cuz I'm not pausing.\n\n449\n00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.210\nYou're supposed to pause between sentences\nand I'm just going on and on and on.\n\n450\n00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.370\nSo let me stop that real quick, there.\n\n451\n00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.820\nSo if I really want to type something\nout I need to be a little more\n\n452\n00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.940\nprepared for that.\n\n453\n00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.690\nSo I want to send an email to Daniel,\nso I come in here and\n\n454\n00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:48.818\nI hit the function key twice.\n\n455\n00:20:48.818 --> 00:20:51.588\nHello Daniel.\n\n456\n00:20:51.588 --> 00:20:55.482\n[SOUND] I think I went too fast.\n\n457\n00:20:55.482 --> 00:20:58.690\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna just screw it up.\n\n458\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:59.510\n>> Winterfest.\n\n459\n00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> Let's try it again.\n\n460\n00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.140\nI didn't wait for it to actually activate.\n\n461\n00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.328\nWinterfest, sounds fun.\n\n462\n00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:07.180\n[SOUND] Hello Daniel.\n\n463\n00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:07.730\nHow are you doing?\n\n464\n00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.290\nIt was nice seeing you today.\n\n465\n00:21:13.785 --> 00:21:17.730\nAll right so see how when done properly,\nits recognition is pretty accurate.\n\n466\n00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.280\nNow I didn't give it any punctuation, so\n\n467\n00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.420\nyou'd probably wanna do that to make\nsure that it knows to put in a period or\n\n468\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:27.140\nwhatever, but I can sit here and\nvoice dictate to it and not have to type.\n\n469\n00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.200\nIt punches it in and it puts it in place.\n\n470\n00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.040\nAnd you can do a lot more than\njust what I'm doing here.\n\n471\n00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:38.040\nSo for example, if I fire up Safari and\nI go to a website.\n\n472\n00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.830\nWhat's a nice long website?\n\n473\n00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.080\nSomething like, we'll go to Slashdot.\n\n474\n00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.790\nSo if I go to the Slashdot website,\nthis is a long website, right.\n\n475\n00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.020\nAnd so, I can scroll up and down.\n\n476\n00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.550\nWell, if I've got my mouse, I can do that.\n\n477\n00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.070\nOr, I can say things to Siri.\n\n478\n00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.908\nSo I can say, not Siri,\nbut, voice dictation.\n\n479\n00:21:55.908 --> 00:21:58.339\n[SOUND] Scroll down.\n\n480\n00:22:02.529 --> 00:22:03.875\nWell that was terribly effective.\n\n481\n00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:08.660\n[LAUGH] So we are supposed to be able to\nsay scroll down and it will scroll down.\n\n482\n00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.730\nOr it will scroll up.\n\n483\n00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:10.420\nLet me try it.\n\n484\n00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.780\n>> Maybe it thinks scroll\nup is what you want.\n\n485\n00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:15.320\nIt's confused.\n\n486\n00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.160\n>> Well it's wrong.\n\n487\n00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.340\n>> Let's just do a longer document here.\n\n488\n00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:19.900\nThere we go.\n\n489\n00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.695\nAnd we'll try that again.\n\n490\n00:22:20.695 --> 00:22:25.319\n[SOUND] Scroll down.\n\n491\n00:22:25.319 --> 00:22:27.220\nThere we go.\nScroll up.\n\n492\n00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:32.130\nAll right,\nnow I'm just going to tap Fn to stop it.\n\n493\n00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.920\nSo telling it to scroll down and\nscroll up and move forward and backwards.\n\n494\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.170\nIt didn't work in Safari for\nwhatever reason.\n\n495\n00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.450\nBut right here in TextEdit you\ncan see it kind of doing that.\n\n496\n00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.730\nThere's a lot of other\nthings that you can do.\n\n497\n00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:44.670\nSo When you have it type a line,\nor whatever,\n\n498\n00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.290\nyou can tell it to highlight things,\nyou can copy things, paste things.\n\n499\n00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:54.974\nSo if you were to double click on Daniel,\nI could say something like copy that.\n\n500\n00:22:54.974 --> 00:22:58.270\nPaste that.\n\n501\n00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.562\nPaste that.\n\n502\n00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.440\nThere.\n\n503\n00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.950\nSo we've got basic copy,\ncut, paste, you got bold and\n\n504\n00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:13.090\nitalics, you can do other things, so\nif I come in and I select things,\n\n505\n00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:17.236\nyou can actually do text selection for\nit, I forget the command for it though.\n\n506\n00:23:17.236 --> 00:23:21.925\nSelect sent, select sentence.\n\n507\n00:23:21.925 --> 00:23:23.841\nBold that.\n\n508\n00:23:23.841 --> 00:23:28.090\nItalicize that.\n\n509\n00:23:30.551 --> 00:23:32.734\nSo now I just told it to select,\nbold, italicize, and\n\n510\n00:23:32.734 --> 00:23:34.590\nit's all just being done\nwith voice command.\n\n511\n00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.770\nSo again, trying to make things as simple\nas possible so that I don't have to do it.\n\n512\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:39.390\nAnd my biggest problem?\n\n513\n00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.170\nI don't use this that often,\nso I forget the command.\n\n514\n00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:42.771\nSo my favorite command?\n\n515\n00:23:42.771 --> 00:23:48.287\n[NOISE] Show commands.\n\n516\n00:23:48.287 --> 00:23:49.141\nOops.\n\n517\n00:23:49.141 --> 00:23:52.192\nDarnit.\n\n518\n00:23:52.192 --> 00:23:53.007\nThere we go.\n\n519\n00:23:53.007 --> 00:23:57.520\nSo now I can look right here and I've got\na big list of all the dictation commands.\n\n520\n00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.960\nAnd you'll see there's a ton of them.\n\n521\n00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.740\nStart Dictation.\n\n522\n00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:00.560\nStop Dictation.\n\n523\n00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.380\nShow commands.\n\n524\n00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.360\nHide commands.\n\n525\n00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.930\nWe've got Undo that, Redo that,\nall of these that are being listed.\n\n526\n00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:07.480\nSee how they got really small?\n\n527\n00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:11.430\nIt heard me talking and it's trying to\nfilter based on what I'm talking about.\n\n528\n00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:12.050\nThere we go.\n\n529\n00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.130\nSo here's all the selection ones,\nSelect all, Select word,\n\n530\n00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.060\nprevious word, sentence,\nprevious sentence, next sentence.\n\n531\n00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:22.250\nWe've got Go to beginning,\nGo to end, Replace, Capitalize.\n\n532\n00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.610\nTons of commands are available for\nworking with this document.\n\n533\n00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.360\nAnd again it's all about\nmaking this easy for\n\n534\n00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.520\npeople that don't have that\nability to use the keyboard.\n\n535\n00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.980\n>> One command that might help you with\nthis, Don, is the stop listening command.\n\n536\n00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.229\n[LAUGH].\nSo when you're done you can say,\n\n537\n00:24:36.229 --> 00:24:39.735\nstop listening, and it will stop\npicking up your text as you go.\n\n538\n00:24:39.735 --> 00:24:40.887\n>> You certainly could.\n\n539\n00:24:40.887 --> 00:24:43.143\nYou can tap your function key\ntwice again to stop it but\n\n540\n00:24:43.143 --> 00:24:45.460\nStop listening would probably\nbe a little more handy.\n\n541\n00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.105\nI just keep having to\ncomplain at it I guess.\n\n542\n00:24:48.105 --> 00:24:51.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So anyhow those are different functions\n\n543\n00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.390\nin here as far as this\nvoice over functionality.\n\n544\n00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:59.670\nNow, or I'm sorry, that was the speech\ndetects, right, or dictation.\n\n545\n00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.800\nIt's important you don't\nconfuse those on the exam.\n\n546\n00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.680\nThe text to speech that's voice over.\n\n547\n00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.450\nThe speech to text.\n\n548\n00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:08.220\nThat's dictation.\n\n549\n00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.940\nAnd you see there's some\nneat functionality there.\n\n550\n00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.170\nAnd just, while we're on it, some of the\nother accessibility items that are there.\n\n551\n00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.360\nLet me get back to my other machine.\n\n552\n00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.340\n>> I used to just think of it as your\ncomputer is your secretary, right?\n\n553\n00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.170\nSecretaries take dictation.\n\n554\n00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.690\nSo, if you think of it as I'm speaking\nto somebody that's going to write these\n\n555\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.770\nthings down, and that is my computer\nthat happens to be my secretary.\n\n556\n00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.290\nYou'll remember that's dictation.\n\n557\n00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:35.110\n>> Absolutely, yep, those are all, there's\nan unlimited number of ways that you can\n\n558\n00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.350\nuse this, it's really powerful stuff if\nyou just get in and kinda figure it out.\n\n559\n00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.480\nSome of the other things that we've\ngot that are kind of along the lines\n\n560\n00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.860\nwith this, things like captions, right?\n\n561\n00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.970\nYou can have subtitles\nthat appear in videos and\n\n562\n00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:47.490\nyou can specify how you\nwant that text to be.\n\n563\n00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.930\nAnd I know a lot of videos are subtitled\nlike this, where it looks terrible.\n\n564\n00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.640\nBut I can come in and I can tell it\nto do large text or the default size.\n\n565\n00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.320\nAnd now it's much more easier to read.\n\n566\n00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.720\nThere's nothing worse than getting it\nwhere it's like white text on a white\n\n567\n00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.380\nbackground when you're watching some show.\n\n568\n00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.420\nAnd so having it blocked out\nlike this is really handy.\n\n569\n00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.530\nSo you can come in and do quite a few\ndifferent things to tweak that behavior.\n\n570\n00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.150\nYou've got other audio\noptions that you can tweak.\n\n571\n00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:16.270\nI like this one, flash the screen\nwhen an audio alert occurs.\n\n572\n00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.501\nSo if you have an audio impairment,\nif you're not able to hear, and\n\n573\n00:26:19.501 --> 00:26:23.034\na bell happens to let you know you got\na new email, that doesn't help you.\n\n574\n00:26:23.034 --> 00:26:24.331\nYou couldn't hear the bell.\n\n575\n00:26:24.331 --> 00:26:27.632\nSo having this you get a little screen\nflash, and I'm pretty sure that doesn't\n\n576\n00:26:27.632 --> 00:26:31.590\nwork in a virtual machine, yeah let me go\nto my regular machine I'll show you guys.\n\n577\n00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:36.730\nSo, When I jump in here and\nI go into Accessibility and\n\n578\n00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:39.350\nAudio, we can test the screen flash.\n\n579\n00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.140\nAnd see how that flash happened?\n\n580\n00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.470\nIt's leveraging the video card driver.\n\n581\n00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.790\nThat's why it didn't work\nin my virtual machine.\n\n582\n00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:49.410\nBut now if I'm using it I know hey,\nSomething just happened.\n\n583\n00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:50.420\nThere was a bell, right.\n\n584\n00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:54.170\nAnd I can look from my notifications,\nor whatever it is that happened.\n\n585\n00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.770\nYou can say, play stereo audio as mono.\n\n586\n00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.570\nNow, this is an interesting one.\n\n587\n00:26:58.570 --> 00:26:59.490\nI use this all the time,\n\n588\n00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.330\nbecause I might hook up an earpiece\nthat's only in one ear.\n\n589\n00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.780\nWell I don't want just the left channel,\nor just the right channel.\n\n590\n00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:06.500\nI want it to be mono.\n\n591\n00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:10.300\nAnd so this converts everything to mono,\nSo we don't get that stereo effect.\n\n592\n00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.600\nThese are just features that\nmost people never think about.\n\n593\n00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.130\nThey're buried here in OS 10,\nif you just go and explore through,\n\n594\n00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.310\nyou'll see there's a lot of\nthem that are really powerful.\n\n595\n00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:22.810\nThey really make a difference and\nthey're just great things to have.\n\n596\n00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:26.450\nWith dictation, I'm still in my\naccessibility system preference and\n\n597\n00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:30.460\nif I go down here under Dictation You'll\nsee Dictation Commands right here.\n\n598\n00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.100\nAnd under Dictation Commands,\n\n599\n00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.450\nhere's where we see all the different\ncommands that are available.\n\n600\n00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.910\nAnd you can turn them on and off.\n\n601\n00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:40.110\nAnd by default you see\na standard set of commands, but\n\n602\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.550\nyou can enable advanced commands.\n\n603\n00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:42.740\nAnd as soon as you do that,\n\n604\n00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:48.150\nnot only do you get more commands,\nyou also get the ability to add commands.\n\n605\n00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.010\nAnd so I can add a custom command.\n\n606\n00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:56.730\nWhen I say this while using\na particular application do this.\n\n607\n00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:02.170\nSo I could say,\nwhen I say Browse the Internet,\n\n608\n00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:09.600\nwhen I'm in any application then I\nwant it to Open a finder item and\n\n609\n00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.880\nwhen I choose open a finder item I can\nbrowse and I can find my web browser.\n\n610\n00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.240\nSo I can go under applications and\nI can find Safari,\n\n611\n00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:22.830\nit is buried in here somewhere,\nthere we go, and I can open up Safari.\n\n612\n00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:28.210\nSo now, if I say browse the internet, in\nany application it's gonna launch Safari.\n\n613\n00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.680\nAnd now that will fire up and\nI'm now got that command.\n\n614\n00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.340\nAnd so when I get out,\nlet's see if I get this to work.\n\n615\n00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.010\nBrowse the internet.\n\n616\n00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.390\nAnd there we go.\n\n617\n00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:39.878\nIt launches Safari, stop listening.\n\n618\n00:28:39.878 --> 00:28:41.468\n[LAUGH].\n\n619\n00:28:41.468 --> 00:28:44.450\nStop listening.\n\n620\n00:28:46.417 --> 00:28:47.760\nThe fun we can have with this.\n\n621\n00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.600\n>> Yeah.\n>> So anyhow it launches Safari and\n\n622\n00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.790\nwent right to the URL\naddress bar right there.\n\n623\n00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:55.970\nSo I immediately could of said,\nGoogle.com and\n\n624\n00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.120\nit would of typed that out and\nbrowsed to it.\n\n625\n00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.960\nSo now I have to create custom commands to\nstart working with the system in a more\n\n626\n00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.030\noptimal manner.\n\n627\n00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.370\nIt just takes working with it.\n\n628\n00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.290\nYou gotta take some time and\nsit down with it.\n\n629\n00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.235\nOn the exam they want you to\nbe aware of the two functions.\n\n630\n00:29:09.235 --> 00:29:13.970\nVoice-over as well as dictation or\ntext to speech versus speech to text, so\n\n631\n00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.360\nthey want you to be aware of that.\n\n632\n00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.890\nAnd be aware of some of the power and\nfunctionality of it.\n\n633\n00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:20.000\nThey don't want you to\nknow all the ins and outs.\n\n634\n00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.320\nBut just for your own personal benefit,\nspend some time learning these.\n\n635\n00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.730\nAnd let me tell you,\neven if you don't have an impairment,\n\n636\n00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:30.110\nbe aware that there\nare other people that do.\n\n637\n00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:34.200\nAnd it you're able to help them make\nusing the computer a better experience,\n\n638\n00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:34.900\nthat's a gift.\n\n639\n00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.550\nThat is a really rewarding thing.\n\n640\n00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.340\nThat you can make somebody\nmore productive at work.\n\n641\n00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.080\nYou can make somebody more\nhappier in their life.\n\n642\n00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.710\nThat their able to use these\nfunctionalities that they wouldn't\n\n643\n00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:46.580\nnormally be able to use, or that would\nbe extremely frustrating to use so\n\n644\n00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.640\nthey choose not to.\n\n645\n00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.400\nSo, take the time to learn it.\n\n646\n00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.100\nThey're pretty easy.\n\n647\n00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.740\nYou just have to know what's there.\n\n648\n00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.260\nGet in and turn them on and\nmake the best use out of it.\n\n649\n00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.430\nTotally agree with you, Don.\n\n650\n00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.460\nAnd thank you for\nshowing us how to use these things.\n\n651\n00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.280\nAnd, you know what?\n\n652\n00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.030\nI might want to start enabling some of\nthese features just for my own benefit.\n\n653\n00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.780\nThere's a lot of cool stuff in there.\n\n654\n00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.830\nWe do want to eventually\nget to that Star Trek level\n\n655\n00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:09.090\nof technology in our everyday\nenvironment so why not start here.\n\n656\n00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:10.610\nWe've already got some of it enabled.\n\n657\n00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:11.250\nGo ahead and turn it on.\n\n658\n00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:11.960\nStart playing with it.\n\n659\n00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.990\nAnd, like Don said,\nthen somebody comes around and\n\n660\n00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.220\nthey need help with that,\nyou can show them that as well.\n\n661\n00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.720\nSo its very cool stuff.\n\n662\n00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.710\nNow that being said Don, guess what?\n\n663\n00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.590\nWe are out of time on this show.\n\n664\n00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:25.500\nWe're moving into\na mini-series territory here.\n\n665\n00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.140\nBut that is cool, because now we're\ngoing to be the likes of v right?\n\n666\n00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.861\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yea, yea.\n\n667\n00:30:31.861 --> 00:30:35.256\nSo, what we got a chance to see\nthe last two episodes were some\n\n668\n00:30:35.256 --> 00:30:39.730\nof the the different features in OS10\nthat other applications can leverage.\n\n669\n00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:44.500\nSo, we talked about Java in the last\nepisode, we talked about voice over and\n\n670\n00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.280\nstuff here.\n\n671\n00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.200\nOur third party applications\ncan leverage all that,\n\n672\n00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:51.170\nthey can use it and\nit really improves their functionality.\n\n673\n00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.670\nWe haven't really talked\nabout the core OS itself.\n\n674\n00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:55.970\nAnd so I do want to get into that and\n\n675\n00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.240\nhow we can manage those apps if we\nhave problems and other things.\n\n676\n00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.640\nSo we're gonna see that in our part three.\n\n677\n00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.760\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGHS] All right, Don,\n\n678\n00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.000\nwell thanks again for stopping by.\n\n679\n00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.380\nThanks again for showing us how\nto use these really cool features\n\n680\n00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.350\nthat we have built into\nour operating system.\n\n681\n00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:13.020\nWe thank you guys for stopping by and\nenjoying, joining us.\n\n682\n00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.290\nWe hope you enjoyed it, and\nmaybe learned a little bit of something.\n\n683\n00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.640\nThat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n684\n00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.490\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n685\n00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.150\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n686\n00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.307\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n687\n00:31:23.307 -->

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:19.171\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode that's right,\n\n4\n00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:22.390\nwe're continuing on with more\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.480\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nfor just a little more of that application\n\n6\n00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.150\nsupport action,\nthat's our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.430\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.138\n>> Thanks for having me back, Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:30.138 --> 00:00:33.490\nWe're ready to hopefully wrap up our\napplication support episode here.\n\n10\n00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.990\nSo we started talking about some of\nthe features in OS X that help to\n\n11\n00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.560\nsupport our applications,\nthat extend their functionality.\n\n12\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.780\nAnd we saw Java.\n\n13\n00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.780\nWe saw iCloud.\n\n14\n00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.900\nWe saw Voice Over.\n\n15\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.070\nWe saw Voice Dictation.\n\n16\n00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.160\nWe saw all these different bells and\n\n17\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.000\nwhistles that extend the function\non their applications.\n\n18\n00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.770\nNow let's talk about what the core\noperating system itself does.\n\n19\n00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.690\nNow, there was a big change in\nthe OS X ecosystem back, well,\n\n20\n00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.762\nit's been a while,\nit's been like seven years.\n\n21\n00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:03.935\nIn Mac OSX 10.6.8, back then, that and\n\n22\n00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:09.170\nearlier, OS X was a 32-bit\noperating system.\n\n23\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.260\nAnd as a 32-bit operating system,\n\n24\n00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.210\nit meant that no one program\ncould use more than 4 GB of RAM.\n\n25\n00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.540\nThat if a single program wanted\nto use more than 4 GB of RAM,\n\n26\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.160\nit had to split itself out into multiple\nprograms, which most people didn't do.\n\n27\n00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.920\nSo it didn't matter if I had 16 gigs of\nRAM, no one program could use all of it.\n\n28\n00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.500\nI can have four programs using 4\ngigs each and that would work, but\n\n29\n00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.290\nno one program could get more.\n\n30\n00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.476\nWell, after 10.6.8, Apple went 64-bit.\n\n31\n00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:42.586\nSo OS X is now a 64-bit operating system\nand El Capitan is no exception, right?\n\n32\n00:01:42.586 --> 00:01:44.620\nIt's still 64-bit.\n\n33\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.940\nAnd that removes that 4 gig limitation.\n\n34\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.180\nSo now if I have 16 gigs\nof memory in my computer,\n\n35\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.560\nI can have one app that\nuses all of it if it wants.\n\n36\n00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.830\nIt can use a ton of extra memory.\n\n37\n00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.950\nAnd for most of us, it doesn't matter.\n\n38\n00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.933\nIf you're firing up Safari or\nChrome or whatever,\n\n39\n00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:01.418\nyou probably don't care about that.\n\n40\n00:02:01.418 --> 00:02:06.017\nBut if you're firing up Adobe Photoshop or\nAdobe Illustrator or AutoCAD,\n\n41\n00:02:06.017 --> 00:02:09.813\nthose programms will consume huge\namounts of memory to run and\n\n42\n00:02:09.813 --> 00:02:14.630\nthey will certainly benefit from\nhaving more than 4 gigs of RAM.\n\n43\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.910\nSo our core operating system by itself,\n\n44\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.350\njust by being 64-bit, makes it easier for\nprograms have access to additional memory.\n\n45\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.108\nSo 4 gigs is the old limit.\n\n46\n00:02:25.108 --> 00:02:29.040\nThe new limit, there actually is\na new limit, it's 18 exabytes.\n\n47\n00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.400\nNow, most of us, we know what megabytes\nare, we know what gigabytes are.\n\n48\n00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.820\nYou probably know the next one,\nwhich is a terabyte.\n\n49\n00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.248\nBut after a terabyte is a petabyte, right?\n\n50\n00:02:38.248 --> 00:02:40.880\nAnd after a petabyte is an exabyte.\n\n51\n00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.046\n>> That's like a skin condition,\nright Don?\n\n52\n00:02:42.046 --> 00:02:43.066\n>> [LAUGH] Where you scratch a bunch.\n\n53\n00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:44.786\n>> [LAUGH] Rash, irritation.\n\n54\n00:02:44.786 --> 00:02:45.906\n>> Yeah.\n\n55\n00:02:45.906 --> 00:02:50.546\n>> So but the exa, it's huge,\nit's a massive amount of memory.\n\n56\n00:02:50.546 --> 00:02:54.510\nAnd in fact, you can't even buy a computer\ntoday that has a single exabyte of memory.\n\n57\n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.860\nSo the fact that we can\naddress 18 exabytes of memory,\n\n58\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.900\nthat means we've got a little bit of\ngrowing room here with 64-bit before\n\n59\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.320\nwe need to go up to the next one.\n\n60\n00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.850\nSo this should carry us at least for\nthe next ten years.\n\n61\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.176\nAnd then we'll see what happens, right?\n\n62\n00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:08.976\nMaybe we'll get a 128 bit systems or\nmaybe it'll skip to 256, who knows?\n\n63\n00:03:08.976 --> 00:03:10.556\n>> Quantum computing.\n\n64\n00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:12.216\n>> Well, yeah,\nthat changes a lot of things too.\n\n65\n00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:15.170\nSo, but 18 exabytes, it's huge, right?\n\n66\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.450\nWe've got a lot of growth room there.\n\n67\n00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.450\nFor applications to take advantage of it,\nit's not enough for\n\n68\n00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.410\njust the OS to support it.\n\n69\n00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.690\nThe OS is now 64-bit.\n\n70\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.510\nBut you can run 32-bit or\n64-bit applications.\n\n71\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.430\nIt'll run both, right?\n\n72\n00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.978\nYou can run a 32-bit app on a 64-bit OS.\n\n73\n00:03:34.978 --> 00:03:36.018\nYou can't do it the other way around.\n\n74\n00:03:36.018 --> 00:03:39.375\nI can't run a 64-big app on a 32-bit OS,\nthat doesn't work.\n\n75\n00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:44.530\nBut 32-bit apps, the old apps,\nwill run on a 64-bit OS, the new OS.\n\n76\n00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.250\nSo you've got backwards compatibility.\n\n77\n00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.050\nBut when you run a 32-bit app, it's\nstill gonna have the 4 gig limitation.\n\n78\n00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.090\nIt's still gonna have that,\n\n79\n00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.360\nbecause it can only see 4 gigs of RAM\nno matter how much you actually have.\n\n80\n00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.940\nSo on my laptop, I've got 16 gigs of RAM.\n\n81\n00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.037\nA 32-bit app will only see 4 gigs of it.\n\n82\n00:04:00.037 --> 00:04:03.950\nA 64-bit app will see all 16 gigs and\npotentially use it.\n\n83\n00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.980\nNow your app doesn't\nhave exclusive access.\n\n84\n00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.520\nIt's not gonna use all the memory.\n\n85\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.950\nIt's gotta share it with\nthe operating system,\n\n86\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.270\nit's gotta share it with other programs.\n\n87\n00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.490\nSo we have to keep track of that, but\n\n88\n00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.348\nit does have the possibility of\naccessing all of that memory.\n\n89\n00:04:16.348 --> 00:04:20.407\nAll right now one problem that you may\nbump into as a support professional,\n\n90\n00:04:20.407 --> 00:04:21.650\n64-bit's great.\n\n91\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.570\nIt's the way you want to go.\n\n92\n00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.040\nApple is pushing us that way, most\nvendors out there are supporting 64-bit.\n\n93\n00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.510\nThe ones that don't, they stay in\n32-bit and those still run fine.\n\n94\n00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.870\nSo it's pretty easy to support,\nmost of us don't have to worry about it.\n\n95\n00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.490\nBut there is a time where we can\nhave a little problem with it.\n\n96\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.970\nSome vendors have not done a great\njob of moving over to 64-bit.\n\n97\n00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.580\nAnd a great example of that is Firefox.\n\n98\n00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.495\nAnd it's not their fault necessarily,\nI shouldn't say it that way.\n\n99\n00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:48.118\nFirefox is a web browser.\n\n100\n00:04:48.118 --> 00:04:52.645\nAnd as a web browser, it used to have the\n4 gig limitation and web browsers, boy,\n\n101\n00:04:52.645 --> 00:04:57.170\nwhen you start opening up a bunch of tabs,\nthey love to get a bunch of memory.\n\n102\n00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.084\nSo if I jump into Firefox here, let me\nget it, I downloaded it before the show,\n\n103\n00:05:00.084 --> 00:05:01.468\nlet me install it here on my machine.\n\n104\n00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:04.902\nAnd so if we take a look at my desktop and\nI go into downloads,\n\n105\n00:05:04.902 --> 00:05:06.428\nI got Firefox right here.\n\n106\n00:05:06.428 --> 00:05:10.608\nAnd if I take Firefox and throw it\ninto my applications, I can launch it.\n\n107\n00:05:10.608 --> 00:05:14.027\nAnd notice how it's not\ntelling me that it's 64-bit,\n\n108\n00:05:14.027 --> 00:05:18.977\nit just shows us Firefox 45.0.1, and when\nI go to install it, I just drag it and\n\n109\n00:05:18.977 --> 00:05:22.080\ndrop it into applications,\nit's gonna copy over.\n\n110\n00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.590\nAnd inside of applications I'm\ngonna see it as just any old app.\n\n111\n00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.187\nAnd when I run it, it looks no different,\n\n112\n00:05:30.187 --> 00:05:33.837\nI just know it's 64-bit because well,\nI've used it.\n\n113\n00:05:33.837 --> 00:05:37.960\n[LAUGH] So, I know it's 64-bit but\nas an end user I don't see that.\n\n114\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.721\nAs an end user, I don't notice\nthe difference between it being 64-bit or\n\n115\n00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:42.968\n32-bit, all right.\n\n116\n00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:47.008\nNow, where Firefox benefits from the extra\nmemory, is that every little tab\n\n117\n00:05:47.008 --> 00:05:50.720\nthat I open up in Firefox is kind\nof spinning off another process.\n\n118\n00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.880\nAnd so\neach one needs a certain amount of memory,\n\n119\n00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.520\nand it's about 200 megs in some cases,\nsometimes a little more.\n\n120\n00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.330\nGoogle Chrome is the same way.\n\n121\n00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.463\nSo the more tabs I have open,\nthe more memory I need, and\n\n122\n00:06:01.463 --> 00:06:04.808\nI can hit that 4 gig limit\npretty quick if I'm not careful.\n\n123\n00:06:04.808 --> 00:06:09.081\nLet me just cancel this import and\nget into the stinking browser,\n\n124\n00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:11.030\nthere we go, and there we go.\n\n125\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.890\nAll right, so now I'm in Firefox,\n\n126\n00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.450\nI'm up and running, and I'm ready to\nstart browsing the Internet, right?\n\n127\n00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.010\nAnd each of these little tabs\nup top is consuming some memory.\n\n128\n00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:26.840\nAnd so the more of these tabs I open,\nand the more websites that I browse to,\n\n129\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.980\nand so on, each one,\nis consuming some RAM.\n\n130\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.200\nSo the more memory I have,\n\n131\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.140\nthe more tabs I can open,\nthis benefits from being 64-bits.\n\n132\n00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.570\nSo Mozilla was really fast,\nabout getting this ported over to 64-bit.\n\n133\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.180\nSo where's the problem?\n\n134\n00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.490\nThe problem is, Firefox supports\na ton of extensions, add-ons.\n\n135\n00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.850\nAnd if you look up here you'll see\nwhere it's even got some by default.\n\n136\n00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.440\nSave to Pocket, and then I can go in and\ninstall third party ones too.\n\n137\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.530\nIf we browse in here you'll\nfind there's add-ons.\n\n138\n00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.160\nAnd I can go into their\nget add-on screens and\n\n139\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.638\nI can find a ton of extensions and\nadd-ons that we can put in place.\n\n140\n00:07:03.638 --> 00:07:07.120\nWell, these add-ons aren't\nwritten by Mozilla.\n\n141\n00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.910\nThey're written by third parties.\n\n142\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.430\nAnd those third parties were really\nbad about updating to 64-bit.\n\n143\n00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.615\nMost of these add-ons\nare still 32-bit add-ons.\n\n144\n00:07:17.615 --> 00:07:24.493\nAnd so if I fire up a 64-bit browser, it\ncan't talk to 32-bit add-ons, they break.\n\n145\n00:07:24.493 --> 00:07:27.600\nI need 32-bit add-ons for\na 32-bit browser.\n\n146\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.700\nI need 64-bit add-ons for\na 64-bit browser.\n\n147\n00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.047\nSo when I fire up Firefox,\nit's running in 64-bit mode.\n\n148\n00:07:35.047 --> 00:07:38.360\nBut these add-ons,\nI'm gonna see just a handful,\n\n149\n00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.070\nI'm not gonna see a full list,\nbecause they aren't updated.\n\n150\n00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.950\nThey're missing.\n\n151\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.510\nAnd so I just see a small selection,\n\n152\n00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:50.300\nwhereas Firefox has hundreds upon hundreds\nof add-ons that I can normally use.\n\n153\n00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.506\nSo it's up to the vendor.\n\n154\n00:07:52.506 --> 00:07:56.775\nBut some vendors said, look,\nwe're gonna release this as 64-bit, but\n\n155\n00:07:56.775 --> 00:07:58.721\nwe'll still support 32-bit.\n\n156\n00:07:58.721 --> 00:08:01.574\nNot every application does this but\nFirefox is one of them.\n\n157\n00:08:01.574 --> 00:08:06.032\nBefore you launch Firefox,\nif you take the application icon, and\n\n158\n00:08:06.032 --> 00:08:07.590\nyou pull up its info.\n\n159\n00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.170\nSo if you do a Cmd+I or\nCtrl+Click and get info.\n\n160\n00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.390\nWhen you look at the information for\n\n161\n00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:17.880\nthat app, notice this option right here,\nopen in 32-bit mode.\n\n162\n00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.870\nI've got the 64-bit version of Firefox,\nbut\n\n163\n00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.350\nI can open it in 32-bit mode if I want.\n\n164\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.160\nWhy would I want to do that?\n\n165\n00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.150\nWhy would I want to put that\nfour gig memory limit on it?\n\n166\n00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.600\nBecause their might be extensions\nthat I need that are 32-bit.\n\n167\n00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.390\nSo that's going to put it in 32-bit mode.\n\n168\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.170\nPackaged inside of this bundle it's\ngot he 64-bit and the 32-bit version.\n\n169\n00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:41.170\nYou've got both of them right here and\nI can choose which one I want to run.\n\n170\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.910\nSo now when I choose that run in\n32-bit mode, I can launch it, and\n\n171\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.750\nas an end user is it going\nto look any different?\n\n172\n00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:52.710\nNo, it looks the same, but it's got a four\ngig memory limit, and now the extensions\n\n173\n00:08:52.710 --> 00:09:00.180\nthat I might want to add on will be\n32-bit and they'll work properly.\n\n174\n00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.860\nThey'll work the way that we want it to.\n\n175\n00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.760\nSo now we can get in, and we can add\nthe like why slow or other add ons\n\n176\n00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.350\nthat we might want to install, and\nit doesn't matter that's a 32 bit add on.\n\n177\n00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.660\nIt's gonna work properly for me,\nand now I can use that system,\n\n178\n00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.220\nand everything's gonna work,\nand it's all in 32-bit mode.\n\n179\n00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:16.980\nAll right.\n\n180\n00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:22.210\nNot every application has that, so for\nexample, if I start browsing around in my\n\n181\n00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:28.040\napps folder I might find other ones that\ndo, lets take Cyberduck as an example.\n\n182\n00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.540\nYeah, see Cyberduck it doesn't even\nhave that open in 32-bit option.\n\n183\n00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.480\nThey ported it over 64 and that's\nthe end of it, and that's what you got.\n\n184\n00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.410\nSo just be aware that you do still have\nthat compatibility in some applications.\n\n185\n00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.110\n>> Don do you think that those 32-bit\napplications are gonna continue to\n\n186\n00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:43.450\nlinger around?\n\n187\n00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.490\nEventually everything's going to\nbe on the 64-bit architecture.\n\n188\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.270\n>> Eventually everything\nwill be 64-bit but\n\n189\n00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.000\nthere are a lot of developers that\nare super dragging their feet.\n\n190\n00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.350\nAnd it's because there is still\ncompatibility, Apple is saying look,\n\n191\n00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.960\nwe are still going to\nsupport those 32-bit apps.\n\n192\n00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.880\nIf your an old time Mac user,\nyou'll remember that back in the day,\n\n193\n00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.400\nMac's had Power PC processors and\nApple switched to Intel.\n\n194\n00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.850\nDevelopers had to recompile their apps for\nIntel and\n\n195\n00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:09.840\nthey dragged their feet back then too.\n\n196\n00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.250\nSo, when the original OS10 came out and\n\n197\n00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:18.580\nthen 10.1 came out we still had\nsupport for PowerPC and Intel.\n\n198\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.690\nBut then when, it was either 10.2 or\n10.3, Apple said, that's it.\n\n199\n00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.470\nWe're not supporting PowerPC anymore.\n\n200\n00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.320\nSo with this version,\nyou can't run those apps.\n\n201\n00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.890\nAnd that's when developers said, crud,\nI got Got to go and update my stuff or\n\n202\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.300\nI won't be able to run it any more.\n\n203\n00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.000\nSo eventually Apple will\nhave to force the hands.\n\n204\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.413\n>> Yeah.\n>> They'll have to say look,\n\n205\n00:10:33.413 --> 00:10:34.655\nfrom now on we're 64-bit only.\n\n206\n00:10:34.655 --> 00:10:35.867\nThat just hasn't happened yet.\n\n207\n00:10:35.867 --> 00:10:37.733\n>> Never underestimate\nthe power of inertia, right?\n\n208\n00:10:37.733 --> 00:10:40.965\n[LAUGH] If you're gonna allow me to\ndo this, I'm gonna continue to do it\n\n209\n00:10:40.965 --> 00:10:45.675\nUntil you make me do something else, so\njus need to cut the cord for everyone,\n\n210\n00:10:45.675 --> 00:10:49.405\nget on out there, it's 64-bit-world,\nlet's embrace it, right, Doug?\n\n211\n00:10:49.405 --> 00:10:51.935\n>> Absolutely, absolutely,\nnow there's other\n\n212\n00:10:51.935 --> 00:10:55.157\nthings that are going on behind the scenes\n>> Means to help increase the stability\n\n213\n00:10:55.157 --> 00:10:56.817\nand reliability of the system.\n\n214\n00:10:56.817 --> 00:10:59.797\nThere's sandboxing which I know we've\ntalked about it in other episodes.\n\n215\n00:10:59.797 --> 00:11:03.867\nWhen every application runs, it's kinda\nisolated to its own little world.\n\n216\n00:11:03.867 --> 00:11:07.588\nSo Firefox and Cyberduck and\nall these programs are isolated Insulate.\n\n217\n00:11:07.588 --> 00:11:10.528\nSo that if they have a vulnerability or\nweakness it just affects them, or\n\n218\n00:11:10.528 --> 00:11:13.808\nif they crash, it just affects them,\nit doesn't affect everybody else.\n\n219\n00:11:13.808 --> 00:11:17.608\nAnd I won't dive into it to deep, cuz I\nknow we've seen sandboxing in like three\n\n220\n00:11:17.608 --> 00:11:20.658\nepisodes now, so I'm kinda hitting\nit over and over and over again.\n\n221\n00:11:20.658 --> 00:11:22.698\nBut it is on the exam,\nit's important to know.\n\n222\n00:11:22.698 --> 00:11:25.211\nSo just recognize that when\nI run these apps, 32-bit or\n\n223\n00:11:25.211 --> 00:11:27.198\n64-bit, they're all running in a sandbox,\n\n224\n00:11:27.198 --> 00:11:31.220\nthey're all isolated into their own little\nenvironment in their own little world.\n\n225\n00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:36.030\n>> Now, with 64-bit apps,\nthese apps can see a lot more memory.\n\n226\n00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.920\nAnd so I always have the risk\nof one application eating\n\n227\n00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.160\nup all the memory on my system.\n\n228\n00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.520\nHow do I know if that's happening?\n\n229\n00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.340\nRight?\nHow do I see that that's occurring?\n\n230\n00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.200\nHow do I know that that problem is there?\n\n231\n00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.010\nWell, there's one tool baked\ninto our system that's really\n\n232\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.350\ngreat at showing that, and\nthat's called the activity monitor.\n\n233\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.600\nThe activity monitor is\nin your applications, and\n\n234\n00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.370\nlet me just browse my hard drive here and\nwe will find it.\n\n235\n00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.460\nIf you go into applications and\n\n236\n00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:04.010\nyou browse in your utility folder,\nit's right in there, the activity monitor.\n\n237\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.750\nAnd the activity monitor will\nshow you all the programs that\n\n238\n00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.530\nare running on your system right now.\n\n239\n00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.170\nWhen I come in, I can see,\nthere's Firefox running right now.\n\n240\n00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.620\nAnd I can see it's eating up 5% of my CPU.\n\n241\n00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.320\nNow it's the background, it's minimized.\n\n242\n00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.370\nI'm not using it.\nAnd it's still consuming 5% of my CPU.\n\n243\n00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.970\nI wouldn't know that normally.\n\n244\n00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.240\nI would think hey it's in the background,\nit's doing nothing.\n\n245\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.880\nBut here it is, I can actually see\nit's eating up resources on my system\n\n246\n00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.130\njust by sitting there idling.\n\n247\n00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.240\nAnd that's because it's\nkeeping its pages alive.\n\n248\n00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.390\nThere's probably some animated video or\nsomething that's updated on one of\n\n249\n00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.700\nthe screens And it's doing that in the\nbackground, now that's just CPU though.\n\n250\n00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.640\nMemory is the one I want to point out,\n\n251\n00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.040\nbecause here I can see how much memory\neach of these applications are consuming.\n\n252\n00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:49.070\nAnd I got Firefox open right now and\nit is consuming a 150 megabytes of memory.\n\n253\n00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.450\nIf I pull Firefox back up,\nI don't have a whole lot open.\n\n254\n00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.400\nBut if I start opening, we'll do CNN.com,\n\n255\n00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.880\nwe'll do a little FoxNews.com,\nwe can do ITProTV, right.\n\n256\n00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.940\nEach one of these are basically processes,\nright.\n\n257\n00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:06.950\nIt's launching these tabs.\n\n258\n00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.020\nIt's accessing the webpages\ninside of these.\n\n259\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.090\nThey've got images and stuff.\n\n260\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.558\nSo, you know a lot of times,\ngood old Donald Trump there.\n\n261\n00:13:14.558 --> 00:13:20.100\nOur website, ITPro.TV, it's SSL so\nit's having to do encryption and\n\n262\n00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.330\nit's got a video that's gonna\nplay here in the background.\n\n263\n00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.731\nActually, if my resolution is low enough,\nthe video might not play.\n\n264\n00:13:25.731 --> 00:13:26.860\n>> No Donald Trump?\n\n265\n00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.443\n>> No, no Donald Trump on our website.\n\n266\n00:13:28.443 --> 00:13:29.977\n>> He's on every other website.\n\n267\n00:13:29.977 --> 00:13:31.028\n>> He's not here.\n\n268\n00:13:31.028 --> 00:13:34.820\n[LAUGH] But we see the website,\neach one of these is consuming resources.\n\n269\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.730\nAnd if I go back to my Activity Monitor,\n\n270\n00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:40.330\nFirefox was consuming 150 megs\nof memory now it's 350 MB.\n\n271\n00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.690\nRight?\n\n272\n00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:45.050\nThat's five tabs,\nif you're one of those people that\n\n273\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:49.850\nopens 20 tabs throughout the day of\n>> I know a guy like that.\n\n274\n00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:50.580\n[LAUGH] That guy.\n\n275\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.420\n>> I keep tons of tabs open.\n\n276\n00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.900\nYou come in here and\nFirefox will be eating 2 GB of RAM.\n\n277\n00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.430\nRight?\n\n278\n00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.550\nIf you start playing Netflix\nvia the web browser,\n\n279\n00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:03.010\nall that stuff eats up memory, and you\nstart to get to close to the 4 GB limit.\n\n280\n00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.630\nAnd if you're in 32 bit mode,\nthat is your limit.\n\n281\n00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.570\nIf you have more, it could even go\nhigher and things could run away.\n\n282\n00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.130\nYou could have a memory leak.\n\n283\n00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.750\nWhere a program starts consuming memory,\nand\n\n284\n00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:15.020\nwhen you close it, it keeps holding\non to it, it never gives it back.\n\n285\n00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.500\nYou can spot it right in here.\n\n286\n00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.800\nNow, what do I do if I have\nan application that's runaway crazy?\n\n287\n00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.030\nThat's just out of control,\nit's all over the place, what do I do?\n\n288\n00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.930\n>> Reboot.\n\n289\n00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:26.580\n>> You could reboot.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n290\n00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.510\n>> You certainly could.\n\n291\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.115\nThat would be the Microsoft solution.\n\n292\n00:14:29.115 --> 00:14:32.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we could also kill the process.\n\n293\n00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.870\nWhen you find an application in\nhere that's running out of control,\n\n294\n00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.810\nyou can choose it and\nsee this little x button up here?\n\n295\n00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:44.550\nThat'll let you quit the application and\nsee how it says Force a process to quit.\n\n296\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.050\nNow the best thing to do would\nbe if Firefox is going nuts,\n\n297\n00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.640\njust go over to Firefox and close it.\n\n298\n00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.300\nRight, I could switch back to Firefox.\n\n299\n00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.850\nI can go up here to Firefox and\n\n300\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.300\nquit Firefox and\nthat would probably help our situation.\n\n301\n00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.110\nOr close some tabs or whatever.\n\n302\n00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.660\nBut what if it's not responsive?\n\n303\n00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.650\nIf it's frozen, I'm clicking on it and\nnothing's happening,\n\n304\n00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.500\nit's just frozen and stuck.\n\n305\n00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.410\nWell, if that's the case, I can't go\nin here and quit, cuz it won't let me.\n\n306\n00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.510\nSo I got two options, one option, or\nI guess I kind of have three options or\n\n307\n00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.070\nfour, right,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n308\n00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.090\n>> There's always options, right?\n\n309\n00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:19.528\nBut one of the easier ways, is if I go to\nthe Firefox icon down here in my dock,\n\n310\n00:15:19.528 --> 00:15:24.610\nI can Ctrl+Click on it and\nin the menu, I can choose Quit.\n\n311\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:29.190\nNow, if the application is\nbehaving nicely, you'll have Quit.\n\n312\n00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.710\nIf the application is frozen,\nthat'll actually change and\n\n313\n00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.990\nit'll say Force Quit, like that, okay?\n\n314\n00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:40.180\nIf the app is frozen, you'll see Force\nQuit and that'll force it to die out.\n\n315\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.020\nNow, my applications not frozen,\n\n316\n00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.730\nI can see the little video\nplaying in the background.\n\n317\n00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.800\nSo how am I making force quit show up?\n\n318\n00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.160\nIf you hit the Alt + Option\nkey on your keyboard.\n\n319\n00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.150\nWhen you hit Option,\nit changes that from Quit to Force Quit.\n\n320\n00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:56.595\nAnd so even if the application is happy\nI can force it to quite right here, but\n\n321\n00:15:56.595 --> 00:15:57.985\nusually we use this if it's frozen.\n\n322\n00:15:57.985 --> 00:16:00.920\nIf it's stuck and I just can't get\nit to respond, I can force quit.\n\n323\n00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.714\nAnd then you can do that from\nthe activity monitor also.\n\n324\n00:16:03.714 --> 00:16:06.364\nSo in the activity monitor\nI can choose Firefox And\n\n325\n00:16:06.364 --> 00:16:09.202\nthis little x button up here,\nthat is force quit, and\n\n326\n00:16:09.202 --> 00:16:13.770\nwe can hit that and it's gonna say\nare you sure you want to force quit it?\n\n327\n00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.780\nOr I can try to gracefully quit it.\n\n328\n00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.660\nGracefully quitting is nice cuz if you're\nin a web browser it'll remember the tabs\n\n329\n00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.790\nyou were on and all that good stuff, but\nif I force quit it that may not happen.\n\n330\n00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.810\nI'm gonna force quit and\nthat's gonna kill Firefox.\n\n331\n00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.840\nAnd it will go away, and I just saw it\ndrop out of my process counts here.\n\n332\n00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.450\nFirefox is no longer running on my system.\n\n333\n00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.110\nSo a neat way that we can spot that.\n\n334\n00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.430\nYou can see CPU and memory utilization\nright here in the activity monitor.\n\n335\n00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:37.350\nYou can see more.\n\n336\n00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.550\nYou can see who's consuming\nthe most battery power.\n\n337\n00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.900\nWho's generating the most disk activity,\nand\n\n338\n00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.800\nwho's consuming the most\nnetwork bandwidth.\n\n339\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.710\nAnd so you can spot who those are.\n\n340\n00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.230\nIsolate what that problem is and\n\n341\n00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.930\ndetermine how healthy your system is,\nactivity monitor is really powerful.\n\n342\n00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:53.730\n>> Yeah, this is great stuff for\nwhen people call you up and\n\n343\n00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.880\nsay my computer is not running\nlike I would like it to be.\n\n344\n00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.390\nThere's something wrong here.\n\n345\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.790\nYou can jump into the activity monitor and\nstart to see well, okay,\n\n346\n00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:06.470\nwhere are the resources for\nthis computer going and here we got it,\n\n347\n00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.540\nare you running Firefox with 95 tabs?\n\n348\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.320\nIs that something you wanted?\n\n349\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.210\nI didn't know it was there.\n\n350\n00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.480\nAnd there you go, you kill that,\nand then you're off to the races.\n\n351\n00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.420\nYou get those resources back,\ncomputer should start speeding up.\n\n352\n00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.050\n>> Absolutely, yep, absolutely.\n\n353\n00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.020\nNow, some of the other\nthings that we can do,\n\n354\n00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.870\nyou might just need to find out\ninformation about your system.\n\n355\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:24.990\nSomebody says, hey I'm running Firefox and\nit's running slow.\n\n356\n00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.820\nAnd you wanna see if they've got updates,\nor what version of OS 10 they're running.\n\n357\n00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.820\nThe system information utility is\nanother one that's really handy for\n\n358\n00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.010\nfinding that out.\n\n359\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:37.990\nSo here in my utilities folder if I keep\nlooking around you'll see this guy right\n\n360\n00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.050\nhere system information has got\na little caliper on the microchip and\n\n361\n00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:45.080\nif I fire that up, I'll get my system in\nfront and this not how normally get to it,\n\n362\n00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.780\nI normally go top the upper menu and\ngo to about this Mac, and\n\n363\n00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:53.930\nyou can pull up the system report, and the\nsystem report, that is this right here,\n\n364\n00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:58.120\nsystem information, and when this fires\nup, I can pull up hardware information.\n\n365\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.938\nAnd I can also pull up software\ninformation and on the hardware side,\n\n366\n00:18:00.938 --> 00:18:03.140\nhere's where I can see\nhow much memory I've got.\n\n367\n00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.940\nThis machine only has 2 gigs of RAM,\nand so I can spot that right here.\n\n368\n00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.890\nAnd I can see what type of\nprocessors it has and so on.\n\n369\n00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.540\nThis is a virtual machine to see\nhow it shows us a VMware machine.\n\n370\n00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.220\nLet's take my actual laptop here so\nif I go into\n\n371\n00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.260\nAbout This Mac and\nSystem Report, here we go.\n\n372\n00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.890\nSo you can see mine's a MacBookPro 11,1,\ngot an i7 2.8 GHz,\n\n373\n00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.420\nI've got 16 GB of RAM so\nI can see how much memory I have.\n\n374\n00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.970\nI don't see my utilization.\n\n375\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.900\nI don't see how much memory I'm using,\nI just see that I happen to have it.\n\n376\n00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.280\nIf I wanna see how much memory I'm\nactually using, well you can browse down\n\n377\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.640\nhere into some of these other areas, like\nsoftware, and network, and you can see\n\n378\n00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.110\nwhat applications are there, but you don't\nactually see what there utilizations are.\n\n379\n00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.850\nSo for the utilization, you're going\nright back to that activity monitor.\n\n380\n00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.740\nAnd the activity monitor,\nyou can go in memory, and I was\n\n381\n00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.070\nhighlighting this stuff up here so i could\nsee who was eating up the most memory.\n\n382\n00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.070\nSo on mine, see this kernel task\nthat's eating 1.2 gigs of memory?\n\n383\n00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.090\nThat's my virtual machine,\nright the VM's are eating that memory.\n\n384\n00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.210\nAfter that, Dropbox, my little file\nsynchronization is eating up 200 megs,\n\n385\n00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.050\nmy software update daemon at 127 megs,\n\n386\n00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:17.310\nI can see who's eating up\nthe memory on my system.\n\n387\n00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.620\nDown at the bottom of the screen though,\nand\n\n388\n00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.870\nthis is what I didn't point out,\nis that I can get a nice, little summary.\n\n389\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:26.570\nAnd I can see right here that all\nof my applications added together\n\n390\n00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:31.690\nare consuming about 3.5 gigs of\nmemory out of the 16 that I've got.\n\n391\n00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.990\nAnd so once we add that in with\nthe other operating system memories,\n\n392\n00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:40.110\nwe end up with right now where I'm\nusing 7.2 gigs out of my total of 16.\n\n393\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.780\nThat means that I've got like 8.5\ngigs of available memory right now.\n\n394\n00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.540\nI've got plenty available which I could\nhave just seen here in the nice little\n\n395\n00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.380\npicture, right?\n\n396\n00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.920\nIf you're seeing that you had 100%,\nif you're out of memory and\n\n397\n00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.440\nyour system's gonna be really slow.\n\n398\n00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.600\nIt's gonna start writing to the hard\ndrive instead of RAM, it's gonna be slow,\n\n399\n00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.740\nyou'll see it right here\nbased on this indicator.\n\n400\n00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.960\nRight?\nSo an easy to way to see that, and\n\n401\n00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.030\nthe same thing for CPU.\n\n402\n00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.510\nIf I got to the CPU tab, we get those\nlittle charts down here too of this CPU\n\n403\n00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.450\nload and whether you're running\nit at 100% or whatever.\n\n404\n00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.790\nWhat you want is a nice big\nfat idle number right here.\n\n405\n00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:15.370\nThe more idle your system is,\nthat's the available CPU power you've got.\n\n406\n00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:20.090\nIf you're at like mine is 91%,\n96%, you got plenty of resources.\n\n407\n00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.500\nBut if you're at 100% utilization up here,\n\n408\n00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.970\nthese little bars are all the way up at\nthe top, your system is gonna be running\n\n409\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:30.470\nslow because it's busy\ndoing lots of crazy things.\n\n410\n00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.900\nSo just be aware that you can see all\nthat right here in the activity monitor.\n\n411\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.325\nAnd then we can use the system information\nscreen just to see what software's\n\n412\n00:20:38.325 --> 00:20:40.128\ninstalled and pull up version numbers.\n\n413\n00:20:40.128 --> 00:20:42.723\n>> Now Don,\nI've worked on help desks plenty, and\n\n414\n00:20:42.723 --> 00:20:46.470\na lot of times people call me up and\nsay, I had an error on the screen.\n\n415\n00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.480\nAnd I say, okay, well,\nwhat did that error say?\n\n416\n00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.155\nAnd they said, well I don't know,\nI clicked okay and it's gone.\n\n417\n00:20:51.155 --> 00:20:52.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I said, okay,\n\n418\n00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.410\nthat's not really helpful.\n\n419\n00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:57.090\nThe errors help me know what\nwas wrong with your computer.\n\n420\n00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:01.840\nNow a lot of times, most computers do\nthis, they say well, just because you\n\n421\n00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.890\nclicked okay doesn't mean I didn't\nmake an entry of what that error was.\n\n422\n00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.910\nI'm assuming our Mac OS is\nnot different then that.\n\n423\n00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.800\n>> Absolutely,\nremember under the hood OS10 is Unix.\n\n424\n00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.980\nAnd in the Unix world everything gets\nlogged, everything gets recorded.\n\n425\n00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.570\nAnd so you have system logs,\na lot of people call them sys logs, and so\n\n426\n00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.000\nyou've got sys logs.\n\n427\n00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.920\nThat are recording every activity\nthat happens on the system.\n\n428\n00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.880\nIf there's an error, if there's an alert,\n\n429\n00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.880\nif there's a warning message of some sort,\nit's getting recorded to the system logs.\n\n430\n00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.120\nSo your end users, they might have\ncleared that error on the screen but\n\n431\n00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.970\nit's still there, we've still got a record\nof it and that's another utility for us.\n\n432\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.230\nIf I browse into my applications and\nI go into utilities, we've seen so\n\n433\n00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:44.860\nfar activity monitor.\n\n434\n00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.570\nWe've seen a system information.\n\n435\n00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:50.630\nThe other one that I wanna\npoint out is Console.\n\n436\n00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:56.240\nConsole is probably one of the most\nobnoxiously named entries, right?\n\n437\n00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:00.280\nBecause it's, Console,\nwhat the heck does it even mean?\n\n438\n00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.040\nRight?\nBut this is the logs, right?\n\n439\n00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.890\nThis is where I can go to see the system\nlogs up of my operating system and\n\n440\n00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.740\nwe can find out what that message\nwas even though it's gone.\n\n441\n00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:13.278\nSo if you run Console, what it's gonna do\nis it's gonna start off by showing you\n\n442\n00:22:13.278 --> 00:22:15.666\nthe system log creation, all messages.\n\n443\n00:22:15.666 --> 00:22:18.094\nYou're gonna see every single\nthing that's been logged.\n\n444\n00:22:19.365 --> 00:22:20.715\nBut you can filter that down.\n\n445\n00:22:20.715 --> 00:22:23.635\nHow about just the diagnostic reports,\nright?\n\n446\n00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:27.645\nSo when a program crashes, it generates a\ndiagnostic report and emails it to Apple.\n\n447\n00:22:27.645 --> 00:22:29.215\nI can see those reports right here.\n\n448\n00:22:29.215 --> 00:22:31.685\nIf I've had a crash and\nit looks like I've had one.\n\n449\n00:22:31.685 --> 00:22:32.515\nMy goodness.\n\n450\n00:22:32.515 --> 00:22:34.635\nThe ScreenSaverEngine crashed.\n\n451\n00:22:34.635 --> 00:22:35.935\nI don't know what we're gonna do.\n\n452\n00:22:35.935 --> 00:22:36.435\n>> Life is over.\n\n453\n00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.120\n>> It crashed,\nI didn't even realize it crashed.\n\n454\n00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.290\nSo it must have happened when I\nwasn't paying attention and so\n\n455\n00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.550\nI can see the exact data that\nit sent to Apple right here.\n\n456\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.720\nThis is the information about that crash.\n\n457\n00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.940\nThere's a little bit in here, I probably\ndon't care about most of it, but if I'm\n\n458\n00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.720\nthe screen saver developer, then this\nmeans something to me and I can use that.\n\n459\n00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.460\nBut more useful for\nus are gonna be these all messages.\n\n460\n00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.730\nHere's where I'm seeing all the things\nthat are going on on my system.\n\n461\n00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.540\nAnd some of these are errors.\n\n462\n00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.380\nSome of these aren't.\n\n463\n00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:07.240\nSo for example right here unmount\ninitiated on Firefox on device disk1s2.\n\n464\n00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.330\nI installed Firefox.\n\n465\n00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.410\nI double clicked the dmg and it mounted.\n\n466\n00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.460\nAnd when I was done with it I ejected it.\n\n467\n00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.712\nHere's the recording that I ejected it.\n\n468\n00:23:14.712 --> 00:23:15.700\nAll right?\n\n469\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.910\nSo it's got it right there,\nwe can see that we ask to exit for\n\n470\n00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.410\nthat disc, I try to eject it.\n\n471\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:25.490\nIf there was a problem ejecting it, I\nwould see it right here, would tell me and\n\n472\n00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:29.660\nso you can look in most of\nthese are just status messages.\n\n473\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.150\nWhich means there's no action to take,\nthere's nothing for you to worry about,\n\n474\n00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:35.070\nthey're just status messages but\nsome of these are legitimate errors.\n\n475\n00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:39.600\nIf a user has a crash,\nthe crash will be logged in here, and\n\n476\n00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.610\nyou'll be able to see that data.\n\n477\n00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.150\nSo even when the user says I just,\nI cleared it.\n\n478\n00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:44.080\nIt's still in here.\n\n479\n00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.830\nSo, I can start to find some of these.\n\n480\n00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.360\nIn a virtual machine you see weird logs.\n\n481\n00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.430\nLet me pull up my actual system.\n\n482\n00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.800\nHere we go.\n\n483\n00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.120\nAnd so, here I am in my actual system and\nI can see messages in here.\n\n484\n00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.184\nSome of them might actually be a problem,\nso like this guy right here.\n\n485\n00:23:59.184 --> 00:24:02.992\nMy address book tried to save and\nit failed.\n\n486\n00:24:02.992 --> 00:24:04.849\nWhy did my address book fail to save?\n\n487\n00:24:04.849 --> 00:24:06.953\nWell my address book is synced to iCloud.\n\n488\n00:24:06.953 --> 00:24:09.164\nAnd so maybe I have some\niCloud connectivity issues.\n\n489\n00:24:09.164 --> 00:24:11.500\nSo it couldn't connect\nup to sync with that.\n\n490\n00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.670\nLooks like my splashtop streamers\nthrowing up some messages which\n\n491\n00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.870\nit's got some kinda problems so\nI might need to update that.\n\n492\n00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:21.860\nThis might just be status messages though.\n\n493\n00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.540\nI don't really see like an error in here,\nits just give me information about it.\n\n494\n00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.480\nBut information every couple\nof seconds it would appear so\n\n495\n00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.090\nthat may indicate a problem.\n\n496\n00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:31.960\nYou can look through here and\nsee what you've got.\n\n497\n00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.210\nHere I've got a transport layer\nsecurity session error so\n\n498\n00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.310\nI was trying to do an encrypted session\nwith something and it failed for\n\n499\n00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.920\nsome reason, it was spotlight doing it.\n\n500\n00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.150\nSpotlight, it used to be when you searched\nspotlight it would only search your\n\n501\n00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.130\nlocal stuff.\n\n502\n00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:48.060\nNow it searches the internet too so\nit'll find your files but\n\n503\n00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.550\nit'll also do some background searches\nto try to find these on the internet.\n\n504\n00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.750\nSo, it can be an overwhelming\namount of information.\n\n505\n00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:59.810\nSo over here, you can can where you can\nfilter it down based on the application.\n\n506\n00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:04.870\nSo maybe I just want to see errors\nthat are related to VMware.\n\n507\n00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.500\nI run VMware Fusion, so\nI can come in here and take a look at it.\n\n508\n00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.180\nAnd it's got USB arbitrators, and so\nI can come in and look at them and\n\n509\n00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.530\nsee if they generated any errors.\n\n510\n00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.100\nThey all appear to be empty, yeah,\n\n511\n00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.720\nhere's just showing where\nthe daemon started, and that's it.\n\n512\n00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.500\nSee if we can't find something\na little more exciting.\n\n513\n00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.265\nPostgres, it's empty.\n\n514\n00:25:24.265 --> 00:25:26.009\nWell, these are boring.\n\n515\n00:25:26.009 --> 00:25:26.880\n[LAUGH].\n\n516\n00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.790\n>> They're supposed to be boring.\n\n517\n00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.120\n>> I know, Hope I can find something\nthat had like an actual error.\n\n518\n00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.000\nBut I'm pretty crash free lately.\n\n519\n00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.880\nSo not a whole lot going on in\nhere as far as, as crashes or\n\n520\n00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.530\nfailures, but you can dive through.\n\n521\n00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.610\nAnd here's a bunch, so\nhere's some application that crashed.\n\n522\n00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:44.490\nAnd it's got binary data that's logged.\n\n523\n00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.610\nThat's incredibly useful.\n\n524\n00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.838\nSo binary data like this is\nnot terribly useful to us, but\n\n525\n00:25:49.838 --> 00:25:53.200\nit looks like we had some\nkind of wireless card crash.\n\n526\n00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.510\nAnd so what it's doing is it's dumping\nthe USB data from my system and saying,\n\n527\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.710\nhere's all the USB stuff I had plugged in.\n\n528\n00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:03.090\nI had a hub, I had a USB key,\nI had an Apple keyboard, Bluetooth,\n\n529\n00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.740\na few different things.\n\n530\n00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.040\nThese are what was plugged in on my\nsystem when it crashed So we can find out\n\n531\n00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:12.270\none of those hardware devices was\nlikely the problem, what was it?\n\n532\n00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:15.800\nAnd so this is just dumping information\nabout that that it then sent to Apple.\n\n533\n00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.160\nSo you'll see different things logged in\nhere based on whatever the crash was.\n\n534\n00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.950\nApparently we're having a lot of crashes.\n\n535\n00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.710\nAnd as far as hardware issues.\n\n536\n00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.040\nSo that's the kind of stuff\nyou can find here in console.\n\n537\n00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.890\nAll the information is\nbeing logged right here.\n\n538\n00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.190\nAnd you can clear it out if you want,\nbut normally, you want it to stay.\n\n539\n00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:33.030\nYou want it to keep, just staying\npresent and having that information so\n\n540\n00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.620\nthat it's there when you need it.\n\n541\n00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.460\n>> That's right, and\nif it gets a little too large,\n\n542\n00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.440\nyou can always just copy them\noff to some removable media and\n\n543\n00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.420\nkeep it off your actual\ncomputer to save that space.\n\n544\n00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.840\nThey're just small text files.\n\n545\n00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.930\nThey usually don't take up a ton of space,\n\n546\n00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.835\nunless you got a really junky computer\nthat's creating a lot of errors.\n\n547\n00:26:48.835 --> 00:26:51.745\n[LAUGH] Then you've probably got\nbigger problems than your storage.\n\n548\n00:26:51.745 --> 00:26:53.580\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n549\n00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.930\nAnd all this stuff is being\nstored on the hard drive, it is.\n\n550\n00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:57.420\nThey are just text files,\nfor the most part.\n\n551\n00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.890\nIt's not that bad, and most of us never\nabsolutely have to worry about it.\n\n552\n00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.370\nI mean, if you have a ton of crashes,\nI mean, every few seconds,\n\n553\n00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.390\nover a course of a few weeks,\nyeah, it could fill things up.\n\n554\n00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.540\nBut you'll spot that, you'll see\nyour disk space kinda declining.\n\n555\n00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.240\nYou know Daniel,\nI think that's about it on this.\n\n556\n00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.810\nI did forget to mention one thing,\nthat it can show up on the exam.\n\n557\n00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:19.550\nWhen you force quit an app, remember I\nsaid there's more than one way to do it,\n\n558\n00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.300\nand I showed you guys\nthe activity monitor and\n\n559\n00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.210\nI showed you using the dock,\ncontrol clicking on the icon.\n\n560\n00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.570\nYou can do it through the Apple menu also.\n\n561\n00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:32.180\nSo for example, here I'm in the console\nand if I wanna force quit out of this,\n\n562\n00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.400\nif I go up to the Apple menu,\nsee how I've got Force Quit right there?\n\n563\n00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.240\nSo that's one more place we can\ngo to Force Quit something, so\n\n564\n00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.460\nI can Force Quit out of the console,\nand we can dump it out that way.\n\n565\n00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.160\nBut when we do Force Quit\nthrough the Apple Menu,\n\n566\n00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.800\nsee how it gives me the choice.\n\n567\n00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.890\nI can pick the applications\nthat I wanna Force Quit, and\n\n568\n00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:51.890\nI can even pick more than one item at\na time, and I can Force Quit them all.\n\n569\n00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.060\nAnd kinda have some fun there but\nI'll just Force Quit the console.\n\n570\n00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.680\nAnd there we go and\nnow it's closed out and that's that.\n\n571\n00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.380\nSo that different functionality,\nit's whichever way works best for you.\n\n572\n00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.620\nYou can do it through activity monitor,\nthrough the dock or\n\n573\n00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.060\nthrough the Apple menu.\n\n574\n00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.020\n>> I like having the option of being\nable to Force Quit anything because\n\n575\n00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.510\nthose pesky little apps, they do tend\nto get locked up from time to time.\n\n576\n00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:17.110\nAnd having a multitude of ways in which\nwe can get those suckers to stop and\n\n577\n00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:21.180\nthen restart without having to reboot\nthe computer is always a nice function.\n\n578\n00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.270\nDon, you said we've come to quite a,\nwe've got through a lot of stuff.\n\n579\n00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:29.050\nAnd before the exam, are we covered,\nhave we hit every base?\n\n580\n00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.860\n>> I think we are.\nLet me throw in one last little thing just\n\n581\n00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.260\nin case this turns up on the exam.\n\n582\n00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.970\nI don't think it will but\nI mentioned all those console logs and\n\n583\n00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:40.150\nDaniel said the size and\nhow they are stored on the disk.\n\n584\n00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:42.980\nLet me show you where they are just in\ncase you ever have to encounter this.\n\n585\n00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:47.330\nI doubt you will but\njust in case if you fire up your terminal\n\n586\n00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.560\nI'm gonna jump into my\nterminal real quick.\n\n587\n00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:55.250\nThe main system logs, the ones that are\nfor the entire computer, the Unix syslogs.\n\n588\n00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:59.790\nThey're stored in the directory\nat /var/log, okay?\n\n589\n00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.500\nSo if you ever go to /var/log and\n\n590\n00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.410\ntake a look in there you'll see\nthat it's full of log files.\n\n591\n00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:07.520\nAnd I've got log files for\n\n592\n00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.900\nopen directory cause I've got the server\napp installed and other ones.\n\n593\n00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:15.960\nBut the main log is this guy right here,\nsystem.log, okay?\n\n594\n00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.450\nThat's the syslog for your computer.\n\n595\n00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.280\nIt's got the main stuff in it.\n\n596\n00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.640\nBut all these other logs\nare pretty useful, too.\n\n597\n00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.200\nIf you ever wanna come in here, though,\nand monitor the size of your log and\n\n598\n00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.980\nsee how big that thing has grown to.\n\n599\n00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.380\nYou can spot it and\nI'm gonna do an OS dash LAH.\n\n600\n00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.180\nAnd there's my system log.\n\n601\n00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.450\nYou see mine's 1.4 megabytes in size.\n\n602\n00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:36.165\nI've got a 500 gig drive.\n\n603\n00:29:36.165 --> 00:29:37.650\n[LAUGHS] I think I can handle that.\n\n604\n00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.520\nBut if it grows,\nI can spot it here and deal with it.\n\n605\n00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.440\nIf it gets too big your Mac will\nactually start to do log rotation and\n\n606\n00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.500\nit will change that out.\n\n607\n00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.980\nSo like let me take my actual computer\nhere and show you real quick.\n\n608\n00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.250\nCuz my actual computer will\nhave more errors I'm sure.\n\n609\n00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.960\nSo if I do an ls -lah and\nI'm gonna try and\n\n610\n00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.030\nfind my syslog in here.\n\n611\n00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:02.900\nHere we go.\n\n612\n00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.620\nYou can see where mine's rotating.\n\n613\n00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:10.350\nSo I've got system.log, but then I've\nsystem.log.0.gz.1 all the way through .6.\n\n614\n00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:15.150\nAs one fills up it creates another one,\nit takes the old one and it gzips it.\n\n615\n00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:18.770\nIt archives it to make it smaller so\nit's a compressed log.\n\n616\n00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:21.230\nAnd so you'll see my current log is 800k.\n\n617\n00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.750\nThese other guys are only 130, 160k.\n\n618\n00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.200\nWell, text compresses really well.\n\n619\n00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.671\nThose things are probably 8 or 9 megabytes\nthat it compressed all the way down to\n\n620\n00:30:29.671 --> 00:30:31.712\n160k, so\nit's taking care of that for me and\n\n621\n00:30:31.712 --> 00:30:35.256\nthat's why I don't normally have to worry\nabout coming in and checking on these.\n\n622\n00:30:35.256 --> 00:30:38.272\nBut just be aware that's\nwhere they're stored, so\n\n623\n00:30:38.272 --> 00:30:42.454\n/var/log If your users have diagnostic\nreports, if a program crashes\n\n624\n00:30:42.454 --> 00:30:46.650\nthe diagnostic reports are actually\nstored as part of the user account.\n\n625\n00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:48.217\nLet's see if I can remember\nwhere those things are.\n\n626\n00:30:48.217 --> 00:30:55.798\nIt is /library/log/diagnosticreports\nthere we go.\n\n627\n00:30:55.798 --> 00:30:57.934\nThat tab auto complete will\nhelp you find the way.\n\n628\n00:30:57.934 --> 00:31:00.634\nAnd so I can look in here and\nsee diagnostic reports that have been\n\n629\n00:31:00.634 --> 00:31:03.160\ngenerated from this machine\non the server level.\n\n630\n00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.960\nAnd then for the user, if they have any,\n\n631\n00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.670\nit'll be in their home\ndirectories library folder/logs.\n\n632\n00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:12.890\nAnd so they'll have log files\nhere that are tied to that user.\n\n633\n00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:17.400\nSo, like, if you look at mine I'm\nin /Users/dpezet/Library/Logs\n\n634\n00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.290\nthat's the other place.\n\n635\n00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:22.435\nSo three places, /var/Logs,\nthat's for the whole system,\n\n636\n00:31:22.435 --> 00:31:28.230\n/library/logs, that's for\nthe diagnostic reports.\n\n637\n00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:33.020\nAnd then /user/theusername/library/logs,\nthat's for the individual users.\n\n638\n00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.890\nDifferent places those log files could be.\n\n639\n00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:37.080\nIf you fire up the console app,\nit's looking at all three so\n\n640\n00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.530\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n641\n00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:41.100\nBut just in case that's where\nthey are on the hard drive.\n\n642\n00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.222\n>> Okay Don, really quick question\ncoming from the chat room.\n\n643\n00:31:43.222 --> 00:31:48.100\nThey wanna know, can we filter by\nseverity or something like that?\n\n644\n00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.330\nGet rid of the informational and just give\nme the stuff that's actually an error.\n\n645\n00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:52.320\n>> Yeah, to an extent.\n\n646\n00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.450\nIn the console app you can,\nhere in the command line we can't.\n\n647\n00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:59.730\nBut in the console app when you pull\nthis up you've got a search box up here.\n\n648\n00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:02.450\nAnd the search box is basically a filter.\n\n649\n00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:06.600\nSo if I want to look for you know,\nactual errors or crashes.\n\n650\n00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.820\nLike let's say I'm looking for\nsegment fall segmentation faults.\n\n651\n00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.070\nSeg faults that's when\na program crashes out.\n\n652\n00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.140\nSo I could look for\nthe word fault and filter that out.\n\n653\n00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.500\nWell, then I got default and\nall that other stuff.\n\n654\n00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.960\nSo maybe I'll search for segmentation.\n\n655\n00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.530\nSo I'm gonna search for a segmentation.\n\n656\n00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:26.160\nI don't have any seg files, so let me do\nmy actual desktop, it will be more fun.\n\n657\n00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:31.670\nYou could also look for a segv is another\nterm that's used for those faults.\n\n658\n00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.570\nSo let me just look for segment.\n\n659\n00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.625\nI don't have any segment\nfaults on my computer?\n\n660\n00:32:36.625 --> 00:32:39.411\n[CROSSTALK] Run a clean shop apparently.\n>> Well I'm a person apparently, yeah so.\n\n661\n00:32:39.411 --> 00:32:43.162\nI could look for the word error,\nyou could look for the word critical,\n\n662\n00:32:43.162 --> 00:32:47.400\nyou can search for those things and\nit will filter this stuff down.\n\n663\n00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.420\nSo if I just look for error then\nthat's gonna filter that down and\n\n664\n00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:54.490\nI can see where TextEdit had some errors,\nfailed to update bookmarks.\n\n665\n00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.190\nOther things here that were kind of\ncrashing out for me for some reason.\n\n666\n00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.950\nAnd that way you can filter it down a bit.\n\n667\n00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:59.950\n>> All right, very cool.\n\n668\n00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:01.520\nWell, Don, thank you so much for\n\n669\n00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.930\nshowing us on all these cool features\nthat are built into El Capitan.\n\n670\n00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:08.890\nThey definitely brought this thing up\ninto the new world, that is for sure.\n\n671\n00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:12.010\nIt's gotta lot of cool,\nunder the hood kinda stuff going on.\n\n672\n00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:15.670\nThank you, Apple, for hearing our\ncries and for fulfilling our needs.\n\n673\n00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.050\nDon, thank you again for stopping by.\n\n674\n00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:18.810\nWe thank our viewers for watching.\n\n675\n00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.350\nHope you enjoyed this episode.\n\n676\n00:33:20.350 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:20.267\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we're continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:20.267 --> 00:00:22.790\nour Apple Certified Support Professional\nseries.\n\n5\n00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.049\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto help us out with that very endeavor is\n\n6\n00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:29.604\nour totally righteous guest,\nMr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:29.604 --> 00:00:31.293\nWhat's up Don, how's it going today?\n\n8\n00:00:31.293 --> 00:00:32.520\nParty on Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.054\nYeah, party on, party on.\n\n10\n00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:33.610\nExcellent.\n\n11\n00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.887\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Like to have a little fun.\n\n12\n00:00:35.887 --> 00:00:37.033\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n13\n00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:39.910\nwe're gonna be diving right back into\nour Certified Support Professional.\n\n14\n00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.610\nAnd you may remember,\nI know it's been a while now,\n\n15\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.440\nbut way back in the very beginning of\nthe series we talked about some of\n\n16\n00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.840\nthe initial setup you do with a Mac.\n\n17\n00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.610\nAnd one of the things we talked about was\ngetting connected to a network, right?\n\n18\n00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.550\nNetworking is extremely important\nthese days, almost everybody expects\n\n19\n00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.370\nto be connected to the Internet,\nand you have to get that set up.\n\n20\n00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.887\nAnd so way back in, I don't know,\nepisode one or two of this series,\n\n21\n00:00:59.887 --> 00:01:02.937\nwe showed the bare minimum to\nget your network configured.\n\n22\n00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:06.556\nBut it was literally the bare minimum,\nlike here's exactly what you gotta put in,\n\n23\n00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:07.400\nand you're done.\n\n24\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.450\nIn this episode we're gonna take\na look at networking again.\n\n25\n00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.420\nAnd we're gonna go a little deeper this\ntime because there's a lot of additional\n\n26\n00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.000\nfunctionality inside of Mac OS that you\nhave to configure, you have to set it up.\n\n27\n00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.653\nYour Mac will try, and\nfigure out your network, it'll try and\n\n28\n00:01:20.653 --> 00:01:21.969\nlearn what you got connected.\n\n29\n00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.000\nThat way it can just get on the network\nand you don't have to worry about it.\n\n30\n00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.600\nBut networks, they can be complex,\nthey can be very difficult to set up,\n\n31\n00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.830\nthey can be challenging,\nespecially in an enterprise environment.\n\n32\n00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.600\nSo for a home user, they don't\nnormally have to worry about it,\n\n33\n00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.280\nthe stuff we saw way back in episode two,\nthat was automatic.\n\n34\n00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.660\nFor a home user, it's no big deal.\n\n35\n00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.180\nBut as an enterprise user,\nyou'll likely have to jump in and\n\n36\n00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.180\nconfigure some of these settings.\n\n37\n00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.260\nSo we're gonna start walking through\nit and get a bit of a deeper dive.\n\n38\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.530\nNow I'll tell you, for\n\n39\n00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.360\nthose of you that have watched our\nNetwork+ training, we're gonna have\n\n40\n00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.230\na little bit of an overlap here cuz we've\ngotta talk about some network basics.\n\n41\n00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.260\nSo if you've done that,\n\n42\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.010\nyou're not gonna hurt my feelings\nif you fast forward a bit.\n\n43\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.240\nBut if you haven't done Network+,\n\n44\n00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.460\nif you're just sticking straight\nwith Apple certifications,\n\n45\n00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.100\nthis might be your first exposure to\nsome things like basic IP addressing.\n\n46\n00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.860\nAnd it's really important that\nyou understand these because\n\n47\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.210\nthey expect you to know it for the exam.\n\n48\n00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.391\nBut it's also useful in real life.\n\n49\n00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:14.285\nBut that's what we're going to\nbe laying out right here, and\n\n50\n00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:18.770\njumping right into what I'm sure will be\na multi part adventure on networking.\n\n51\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.501\nWell, Don, networking,\nit's a pretty broad topic.\n\n52\n00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:23.692\nSo it's hard to find\na good starting point, so\n\n53\n00:02:23.692 --> 00:02:25.665\nI know that you're really great at that.\n\n54\n00:02:25.665 --> 00:02:29.015\n[LAUGH] Where do we begin when you\nstart talking about networking?\n\n55\n00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.741\nAll right, let's just start with\nthe different types of networks,\n\n56\n00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:32.920\ncuz that's really changed.\n\n57\n00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.200\nBack in the 80s, and even the 90s,\nyou had Apple Talk networks.\n\n58\n00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.115\nAnd so, if you had a couple of Macs, and\nyou wanted them to talk to each other,\n\n59\n00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:44.966\nyou stuck those Apple Talk\ndongles onto your computer.\n\n60\n00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:48.188\nAnd this is way back, a lot of you guys\nhave probably never even heard of these.\n\n61\n00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:50.388\nBut there were these little\ndongles that would plug in, and\n\n62\n00:02:50.388 --> 00:02:52.380\nthey basically had two\nphone jacks on them.\n\n63\n00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.910\nAnd you would daisy chain\nthese RJ11 phone cables,\n\n64\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.570\nfour wire category three cable,\nrunning from computer to computer.\n\n65\n00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.380\nAnd you'd get this insanely slow but\nfunctional network,\n\n66\n00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.310\nand that was how it was done back then.\n\n67\n00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.590\nWell, in the 90s things changed a lot, and\n\n68\n00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.260\npeople started moving into one standard\ntype of network called Ethernet.\n\n69\n00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.940\nAnd Ethernet networking worked\nacross Apple, Unix, Windows,\n\n70\n00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.870\nit worked everywhere, and so\npeople really latched onto that.\n\n71\n00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.032\nAnd that became the standard, and\nso Ethernet networks are common,\n\n72\n00:03:24.032 --> 00:03:26.554\nthat's the one that we're\nnormally gonna deal with.\n\n73\n00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:30.480\nNow, in the 90s it was\ncopper based cabling.\n\n74\n00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.220\nYou had these network cables that\nwould run between your computers and\n\n75\n00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.130\nthat's how you got\nconnected to the network.\n\n76\n00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.520\nAnd so everybody was connecting\nusing basically the same technology.\n\n77\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.657\nWell, at the end of the 90s things\nwent crazy, things went nuts, right.\n\n78\n00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:46.848\nThe dot-com boom happened,\ntons of money was getting thrown into IT.\n\n79\n00:03:46.848 --> 00:03:50.696\nAnd now we find ourselves today with\nnumerous different networking technologies\n\n80\n00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:51.920\nthat are out there.\n\n81\n00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.150\nSo we don't all have the same\nstandard network connection anymore.\n\n82\n00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.585\nIt used to be that everybody had a copper\nbased network jack in their computer that\n\n83\n00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:01.700\nyou'd plug a physical cable into.\n\n84\n00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.085\nBut now you might not be using that, you\nmight be using Thunderbolt, or Bluetooth.\n\n85\n00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:10.850\nYou might be using FireWire or\nwireless networks, right?\n\n86\n00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.997\nNow, I know what you're thinking,\nDon, FireWire's not a network,\n\n87\n00:04:13.997 --> 00:04:15.844\nthat's not gonna get me on the Internet.\n\n88\n00:04:15.844 --> 00:04:19.040\nOr Bluetooth, that's not a network,\nthat's not gonna get me on the Internet.\n\n89\n00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.736\nWell, for the most part you'd be right.\n\n90\n00:04:20.736 --> 00:04:24.654\nNormally when I hook something up\nthe FireWire it's a printer, right, or\n\n91\n00:04:24.654 --> 00:04:26.591\na hard drive or something like that.\n\n92\n00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:29.718\nBut FireWire actually\ndoes create a network,\n\n93\n00:04:29.718 --> 00:04:33.093\nyou're using a network to\ntalk to those devices.\n\n94\n00:04:33.093 --> 00:04:36.700\nAnd you can get FireWire network adapters,\nthere's not many of them, but you can.\n\n95\n00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.915\nThunderbolt, on the other hand, right,\n\n96\n00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:39.518\nThunderbolt we're normally\nplugging in hard drives.\n\n97\n00:04:39.518 --> 00:04:43.550\nBut you can plug in monitors,\nyou can also plug in network adapters.\n\n98\n00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.158\nAnd I've got one on my laptop right here,\na Thunderbolt Ethernet jack that I just\n\n99\n00:04:47.158 --> 00:04:50.150\nstick onto my laptop so\nI can have a physical connection.\n\n100\n00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.010\nBecause my laptop doesn't have a network\ncard in it, well not a physical one.\n\n101\n00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.420\nIt's got a wireless card in it, and so\nit's designed to connect to wireless\n\n102\n00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.580\nnetworks, which most\nof us have these days.\n\n103\n00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.449\nBut I also have Bluetooth support,\nwhich is a network.\n\n104\n00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.368\nI have Thunderbolt support so\nI can plug in a physical Ethernet jack and\n\n105\n00:05:05.368 --> 00:05:06.170\nconnect that way.\n\n106\n00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.900\nI've got several different choices for\nhow I want to do that networking.\n\n107\n00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.920\nNow the choice for you is largely\ngonna be based on whatever hardware's\n\n108\n00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.650\nbuilt into your computer, right?\n\n109\n00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.250\nSo what options do you have?\n\n110\n00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.740\nIf you get one of the new MacBook Airs,\nall it has is a wireless\n\n111\n00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.440\nnetwork adapter and a USB C connector,\nand that's it, that's all it's got.\n\n112\n00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.472\nSo the wireless connector,\n\n113\n00:05:29.472 --> 00:05:31.752\nthat's gonna be the one that you\nuse to get out on the Internet.\n\n114\n00:05:31.752 --> 00:05:35.470\nBut it's also got Bluetooth built into it,\nand you can do Bluetooth networking.\n\n115\n00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.984\nSo for example, you can take an iPhone,\nand you can put it in hotspot mode,\n\n116\n00:05:39.984 --> 00:05:44.944\nwhat do they call it, personal hotspot,\nyou can put it in personal hotspot mode.\n\n117\n00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:48.536\nAnd so now you can take your laptop and\nconnect to your cellphone via Bluetooth,\n\n118\n00:05:48.536 --> 00:05:52.137\nand use your cell phone's Internet access\nto go out over the cellular network.\n\n119\n00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:56.660\nSo you can tether, there, that's the word\nI was looking for, wireless tethering.\n\n120\n00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.760\nIs that we can tether to our phones, and\n\n121\n00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.950\nthat's all done through\nnetworking over Bluetooth.\n\n122\n00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.840\nSo a lot of neat little\nfeatures out there,\n\n123\n00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.400\nand it's up to you how\nyou want to support that.\n\n124\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.608\nNow, let me just show you an example here,\nso I've got a stock install of OS X.\n\n125\n00:06:09.608 --> 00:06:16.220\nAnd this is El Capitan, and\nyou might have a Mac Pro or something that\n\n126\n00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.820\nis just super simple in its configuration,\nthat it only has one network adapter.\n\n127\n00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.430\nIt's pretty rare though, these days Apple\npackages multiple adapters in everything.\n\n128\n00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.870\nBut this is a virtual machine here and so\nwhen I go into my System Preferences and\n\n129\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.810\nI go into my Network Adapters,\nI've only got one.\n\n130\n00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:32.860\nSo in System Preferences,\n\n131\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.200\nif I go to Network, I'm gonna see\njust one connection, Ethernet.\n\n132\n00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.910\nIt says I've got an Ethernet connection,\nand it's connected, right,\n\n133\n00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.480\na physical cable and it's plugged in.\n\n134\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.310\nBut that's not what you're\ngonna see in real life land.\n\n135\n00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.481\nLet me show you my laptop.\n\n136\n00:06:46.481 --> 00:06:49.510\nSo here on my laptop\nI've got a MacBook Pro.\n\n137\n00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.797\nAnd if I go into my System Preferences,\nand I go into Network, I have so\n\n138\n00:06:53.797 --> 00:06:57.214\nmany stinking networks that I\nhave to have a scroll bar to\n\n139\n00:06:57.214 --> 00:07:01.092\nscroll through them because\nthey're off the screen, right.\n\n140\n00:07:01.092 --> 00:07:03.050\nSo let's talk about what we've got.\n\n141\n00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.590\nThe very first one is\na Thunderbolt Ethernet connection.\n\n142\n00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.650\nThat's the Thunderbolt Ethernet jack\nthat I've got plugged in my laptop.\n\n143\n00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:15.570\nI use it here in the studio because wired\nconnections are reliable and trustworthy.\n\n144\n00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.764\nI've got wireless built in my laptop and\nthere's a wireless network here.\n\n145\n00:07:17.764 --> 00:07:22.850\nIn fact, you can see, Wi-Fi Connected, I'm\nconnected to the ITProTV wireless network.\n\n146\n00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.210\nSo why don't I just use that?\n\n147\n00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.820\nIt'd be one less cable.\n\n148\n00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.990\nWell, wireless networks\naren't as reliable.\n\n149\n00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.345\nDepending on how many walls\nare between me and that access point,\n\n150\n00:07:32.345 --> 00:07:36.809\nI might have a weak signal versus a strong\nsignal, who knows, it fluctuates, right.\n\n151\n00:07:36.809 --> 00:07:39.244\nLet me see if I can show you guys that,\n\n152\n00:07:39.244 --> 00:07:43.350\nI have a little program called\nNetSpot that I like to use.\n\n153\n00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.730\nAnd what this program does\nis it scans your network and\n\n154\n00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.330\nit shows all the access\npoints that are out there.\n\n155\n00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:55.195\nSo the ITProTV wireless network right\nhere, look over at its signal strength,\n\n156\n00:07:55.195 --> 00:07:55.712\nright.\n\n157\n00:07:55.712 --> 00:08:00.087\nIf I look at that signal strength I've\ngot like a -43 dB on it right now.\n\n158\n00:08:00.087 --> 00:08:02.745\nIs that the strongest one that I've got?\n\n159\n00:08:02.745 --> 00:08:06.606\nYeah, that's the strongest It Pro TV\nwireless signal that I'm getting and\n\n160\n00:08:06.606 --> 00:08:08.550\nsee how it just went to negative 42?\n\n161\n00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.210\nAnd as we watch it,\nit'll sit here and it'll change.\n\n162\n00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.220\nThis program is tracking the maximum and\nthe minimum and\n\n163\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.530\nyou'll see some of these\ncan vary pretty widely.\n\n164\n00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.660\nWe've got 68 to 71, that's not very wide.\n\n165\n00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.090\n37 to 41, but if I were to start walking\naround, these numbers would change.\n\n166\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.920\nWireless networks are nice\nbecause they're convenient,\n\n167\n00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.740\nbut they don't give you\nreliable performance.\n\n168\n00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.350\nYou don't get the same\nlevel of performance,\n\n169\n00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:35.099\nand in this case,\nits an 802.11 b/g/n network.\n\n170\n00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:39.015\n802.11b only runs at 11 megabits.\n\n171\n00:08:39.015 --> 00:08:41.843\n11 megabits per second,\nthat's the amount of data it moves.\n\n172\n00:08:41.843 --> 00:08:45.970\nG can go up to 54 megabits per second.\n\n173\n00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.370\nN starts to get a little weird, right?\n\n174\n00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.150\nBut it's usually around\n200 megabits per second.\n\n175\n00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.320\nIt's kinda weird, it caps out.\n\n176\n00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.290\nYou hear people can get more if they're\nstanding right next to the access point.\n\n177\n00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.400\nBut, in practice, it's usually around 200.\n\n178\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.440\nFirst, there's a wired network.\n\n179\n00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.960\nWhen you plug in a wired network,\nyou might have a 100 megabit connection.\n\n180\n00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:07.840\nWell, 802.11n can do 200 megabit,\nthat's better, isn't it?\n\n181\n00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.030\nIt is when it's working, right,\nwhen I've got a good, strong signal.\n\n182\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.290\nBut when the signal gets weak,\nI don't get 200,\n\n183\n00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.400\nit starts to drop down,\nI can't rely on it always being there.\n\n184\n00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:20.280\nBut when I plug in a physical connector, a\n100 megabit connector, I get 100 megabit.\n\n185\n00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.760\nI'm wired in and it's always there, it's\nalways available, I've got that access,\n\n186\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.620\nso there's no real good substitute for\nphysical connectivity.\n\n187\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.240\nWe're seeing wireless come a long way but\nyou'll have that and\n\n188\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.230\nwhat you'll see is that your Mac may or\nmay not be preferring to use it.\n\n189\n00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.190\nSo I can see that mine is using the\nThunderbolt connection over the wireless,\n\n190\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.470\nso whatever's first in the list\nis gonna be preferred.\n\n191\n00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.180\nI'm using my wired connection.\n\n192\n00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.030\nEven though technically my wireless might\nhave more bandwidth, I'm still preferring\n\n193\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.430\nthe wired because it's more reliable,\nif we've got that access.\n\n194\n00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.150\nAll right, so Thunderbolt,\nWi-Fi, what do I have here?\n\n195\n00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.414\nUSB Ethernet, you can buy USB 2.0 or\nUSB 3.0 adapters,\n\n196\n00:10:00.414 --> 00:10:03.120\nthey give you a physical network jack.\n\n197\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.330\nAnd I have a docking station in my office,\nwhen I put my laptop in the docking\n\n198\n00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.020\nstation, I've got that physical adapter\nover there, and so it connects and\n\n199\n00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.770\nI'm able to get that,\nI've actually got two of those.\n\n200\n00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.510\nI've got some AJA mini converters.\n\n201\n00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.970\nWhat the heck are those?\n\n202\n00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.310\nWell, we have these little devices,\nthere's one under my desk here,\n\n203\n00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.100\nthat takes the video on my laptop screen\nand sends it into our video switch.\n\n204\n00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.510\nIt's how you guys see my laptop right now.\n\n205\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.120\nIf I want to configure it,\n\n206\n00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.130\nit's got this little software\npackage we use called MiniConfig.\n\n207\n00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.030\nAnd what MiniConfig does is it\nconnects to that device, and\n\n208\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.710\nit lets us see it and\nconfigure its settings, and so on.\n\n209\n00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:38.750\nAnd it does it over USB.\n\n210\n00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.800\nBut it's actually building a network,\na network between the mini config software\n\n211\n00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.920\nand the physical device\nthat it's out there with.\n\n212\n00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.180\nSo here I see it.\n\n213\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.100\nSo it's building a network\nconnection to that device.\n\n214\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:56.810\nAnd when it does that, well, it's using\none of these little virtual adapters here.\n\n215\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.940\nThese are fake adapters,\nthey're not real adapters.\n\n216\n00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.690\nIn fact, let me see if I have one.\n\n217\n00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.690\nHere maybe I can plug that in and\nI can show you guys.\n\n218\n00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:07.290\nSo I'm gonna take this USB 2.0 connector,\nwe plug it in.\n\n219\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.030\nLet's see if that device is actually\nthere, and we'll get that connected.\n\n220\n00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.630\nSo what's gonna happen is one of\nthese little AJA mini-converter\n\n221\n00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.530\nports will light up because it's now\ngot this virtual network connection.\n\n222\n00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:19.960\nThat allow me to see the device,\n\n223\n00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.980\nso these network adapters aren't\nalways true physical things.\n\n224\n00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:28.200\nI've got air console, air console's a\nlittle serial report utility that I use to\n\n225\n00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.470\nconnect to Cisco routers and\n\n226\n00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.870\nswitches over the wireless, so\nthat's a virtual connection.\n\n227\n00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.190\nYou may have VPNs, Virtual Private\nNetworks, right, VPNs are virtual.\n\n228\n00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.150\nThey're not a real network adapter,\nit's a fake one.\n\n229\n00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.680\nThis design to build an encrypted\ntunnel between you and\n\n230\n00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.210\nsome other destination out there.\n\n231\n00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.760\nThe only other exciting one I\nhave here is Bluetooth PAN.\n\n232\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.310\nPAN is a personal area network.\n\n233\n00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:53.940\nSo a Bluetooth PAN is me talking to one or\nmore Bluetooth devices.\n\n234\n00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.270\nI might have a Bluetooth keyboard,\nmouse, network adapter.\n\n235\n00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.990\nI might have a Bluetooth What else\nis out there that's Bluetooth?\n\n236\n00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.090\nAll sorts of crazy gadgets.\n\n237\n00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.080\nYeah.\nThey got fingerprint reader, right?\n\n238\n00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.910\nWhatever it is that I've got.\n\n239\n00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:05.580\nSpeakers.\n\n240\n00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.380\nYeah.\nBluetooth speakers.\n\n241\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.850\nYup.\nYou see those all over the place.\n\n242\n00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.110\nSo I would show,\n\n243\n00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.760\nshow those devices as connected via\nthis Bluetooth personal area network.\n\n244\n00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.730\nYou really see it with mobile phones,\nthough.\n\n245\n00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.340\nSo if you notice over here,\na device that's not connected.\n\n246\n00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.710\nDon Pezet's iPhone, right?\n\n247\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:23.010\nSo I can connect to my iPhone via\nBluetooth and it creates a network and\n\n248\n00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.740\nthat network would allow me to get\nout to the Internet or whatever.\n\n249\n00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.810\nAt least transfer files,\ndo AirDrop with my phone if I connect.\n\n250\n00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.780\nSo I've only got the one and\nin fact, that's my old iPhone.\n\n251\n00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.640\nI got a new iPhone.\n\n252\n00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.000\nSo I'd have to add that one\nin to get that connected.\n\n253\n00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.880\nAnd you'll see right down here.\n\n254\n00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.950\nI got Set Up Bluetooth device.\n\n255\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.370\nSo I can do that,\nI can connect it to my phone.\n\n256\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.130\nAnd create this new\nnetwork if I choose that.\n\n257\n00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.010\nSetup bluetooth device.\n\n258\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.300\nIt's scanning.\n\n259\n00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.290\nAnd it showing an iPhone.\n\n260\n00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.590\nI'm pretty sure that's my old iPhone,\nso let me just take my new one here.\n\n261\n00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.760\nI had an iPhone 5S, now it's a 6S and\nI'm pretty sure that's my old one.\n\n262\n00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.870\nSo if I go in and I turn on my Bluetooth,\n\n263\n00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:04.090\nso what's gonna happen is I\nstart scanning it, there it is.\n\n264\n00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.450\nI see Don Pezet's iPhone,\nI'll go ahead and pair to it.\n\n265\n00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.750\nAnd so it's gonna connect up to my phone,\nand when it does it shows a code.\n\n266\n00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.530\nI can look on my phone and make sure\nI see the same code, which I do, and\n\n267\n00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.850\nI'll hit pair, and\nnow it's gonna connect up.\n\n268\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:20.750\nI'm building a bluetooth connection\nbetween Mac OS on my laptop And\n\n269\n00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.110\niOS on my iPhone.\n\n270\n00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.980\nAnd so there it shows, it shows as\nnot connected but give it a second.\n\n271\n00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.560\nSee up here it's kind of thinking.\n\n272\n00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.690\nSo it's there, it's working through its\nissues and then it'll be connected.\n\n273\n00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.850\nWhen it's connected, I'll have\na bluetooth personal area network,\n\n274\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.700\na PAN, between my laptop and the phone.\n\n275\n00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:45.670\nAnd as long as I have my personal hotspot\nturned on, which it turns out I don't.\n\n276\n00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.420\nNow let me turn that on.\n\n277\n00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.800\nAs long as I have my\npersonal hotspot turned on,\n\n278\n00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.210\nI'll be able to use that\nas a network adapter.\n\n279\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.890\nI'll have another way to get connected to\nthe Internet by using this other device.\n\n280\n00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:59.390\nAnd that's what shows up when we look\nhere in our networking settings.\n\n281\n00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.440\nWhen you look at that bluetooth pan for\nexample, and now I've got the two phones.\n\n282\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.940\nAnd so I can use my new phone and connect.\n\n283\n00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.970\nAnd it's gonna reach out and try and\nestablish a connection to the phone and\n\n284\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.600\nbuild that fake network adapter.\n\n285\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.280\nI'll know it works when\nthat turns green and\n\n286\n00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.540\nI know I've got a good connection and\nI'm off to go.\n\n287\n00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.750\nThis is useful if you want to\nuse your laptop in the car.\n\n288\n00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.900\nSo, not when you're driving, right.\n\n289\n00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.150\nLike the police.\n\n290\n00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.730\nYou know what?\n\n291\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.070\nI'll give you a great example.\n\n292\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.085\nNot the band.\n\n293\n00:14:23.085 --> 00:14:27.530\n[LAUGH] My wife and I, we drove from\nGainesville Florida to Seattle Washington,\n\n294\n00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:28.750\nwe drove across the entire country,\n\n295\n00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:32.490\nand when we did it we didn't\nreally plan hotels along the way.\n\n296\n00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.540\nAnd, what we would do is when we got\nto about an hour away from where we\n\n297\n00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.110\ndecided to stop each day, she'd fire up\nthe laptop that was tethered to the phone.\n\n298\n00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.750\nIn that way, you would get internet\naccess via the cellular network.\n\n299\n00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.000\nAnd she look up the hotel that was\nin the next town down the street and\n\n300\n00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.790\nbook the hotel and we'd pull in and\nhave our hotel rooms.\n\n301\n00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.600\nAnd we did that for days and\nit worked out really well.\n\n302\n00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.740\nYou had internet access wherever you went.\n\n303\n00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.640\nSo those technologies are really useful\nbecause they give you that extra\n\n304\n00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.840\nfunctionality of being able to reach out\nthere and get connected on these networks.\n\n305\n00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.390\nAll right, now,\nwhen we fire up these networks,\n\n306\n00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.570\nI've kind of been talking about what\nwe call the physical network, right?\n\n307\n00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.150\nAnd it's not always physical,\nit's not something you can touch.\n\n308\n00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.200\nWhen we talk about Ethernet networks,\nwe're only talking about copper cabling.\n\n309\n00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.380\nYou've got network cables.\n\n310\n00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.320\nYou can touch them.\n\n311\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.230\nThey're real things you can hold.\n\n312\n00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.630\nBut wireless networks, you're\ntalking about radio frequency waves.\n\n313\n00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.620\nLittle air waves that are out\nthere floating around.\n\n314\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.660\nYou can't touch those.\n\n315\n00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.390\nYou can't see them.\n\n316\n00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.418\nThe tumors you get are real.\n\n317\n00:15:26.418 --> 00:15:28.747\n[LAUGH] Unseen benefits.\n\n318\n00:15:28.747 --> 00:15:32.190\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] But\nwhich has sadly not been fully tested.\n\n319\n00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.750\nBut, sometimes it's virtual like that.\n\n320\n00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:35.780\nBluetooth is virtual.\n\n321\n00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.200\nI can't touch the Bluetooth waves.\n\n322\n00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.170\nThey apparently can touch me.\n\n323\n00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.800\nSo sometimes it's physical,\nsometimes it's wireless.\n\n324\n00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.300\nBut they all work\nbasically the same thing.\n\n325\n00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.280\nThat's said to be down at what's\ncalled our physical layer.\n\n326\n00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.840\nBut once you have a physical\nconnection that's not enough.\n\n327\n00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.000\nThen you need a logical\nconnection on top of it.\n\n328\n00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.300\nSome protocol,\na language that your devices can speak.\n\n329\n00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.374\nAnd it's just like when people talk.\n\n330\n00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:00.251\nSo, if I wanna talk to Daniel,\nDaniel speaks English.\n\n331\n00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:01.334\nI speak English.\n\n332\n00:16:01.334 --> 00:16:02.761\nWe can talk, it's no problem.\n\n333\n00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:06.001\nBut what if Daniel spoke German and\nI spoke French?\n\n334\n00:16:06.001 --> 00:16:08.730\nWe'd have a hard time talking, right?\n\n335\n00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.430\nWe've gotta have a common\nlanguage between us.\n\n336\n00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.630\nAnd so in networking we have protocols and\n\n337\n00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.650\nthose protocols are the languages\nthat we talk to other computers.\n\n338\n00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:20.600\nSo back in the day,\nwe used to have Appletalk on macs, and\n\n339\n00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.890\non Windows machines you had SMB or\nNetBIOS.\n\n340\n00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.208\nAnd on Linux and\nUnix machines you had TCP/IP.\n\n341\n00:16:27.208 --> 00:16:29.551\nSo you had these three\ndifferent languages, and\n\n342\n00:16:29.551 --> 00:16:31.820\nnobody would talk to each other.\n\n343\n00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.770\nAnd so third party started writing\nsoftware to make it where one device could\n\n344\n00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.170\nsee the other, and sometimes a company\nlike Apple would license technology from\n\n345\n00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.930\nMicrosoft to make them talk together.\n\n346\n00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.870\nBut over time,\nthey realized how impractical that was.\n\n347\n00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.910\nAnd TCP/IP became the standard language,\nthe language that everybody ran.\n\n348\n00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.160\nAnd so today,\nif you're on Windows, Lennox, or\n\n349\n00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.730\nMAC they all support TCP/IP,\nall of them do.\n\n350\n00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.900\nAnd they might still have AppleTalk as\na protocol that can run on top of TCP/IP,\n\n351\n00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.650\nor NetBIOS that can be run\non top of TCP/IP, but for\n\n352\n00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:06.000\nthe most part we just do\nstraight up TCP/IP networking.\n\n353\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.120\nNow that name, TCP/IP,\nlet's talk about that just a little bit.\n\n354\n00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.200\nI'm gonna just write\nit here on the screen.\n\n355\n00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:18.215\nIf you've never seen it, it's normally\nwritten like this, right, TCP/IP, right.\n\n356\n00:17:18.215 --> 00:17:20.990\nAnd what it is is actually two protocols.\n\n357\n00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:29.172\nTCP is the Transmission Control Protocol\nand IP is the Internet Protocol.\n\n358\n00:17:29.172 --> 00:17:31.910\nAll right, these two protocols\nare combined into what's called a protocol\n\n359\n00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.690\nsuite and\ntogether they create our network stack.\n\n360\n00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.300\nThey make it where we can\ncommunicate on the network and\n\n361\n00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.090\neach of the protocol does\nsomething a little different.\n\n362\n00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:46.880\nIP, the Internet Protocol, what it\ndoes is it gives everybody an address,\n\n363\n00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.940\na number, for two computers to\ntalk they have to have numbers.\n\n364\n00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.570\nThink of it as like phones.\n\n365\n00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.350\nIf I wanna call Daniel on the phone,\nI need his phone number, but\n\n366\n00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.280\nI have to have a phone number too.\n\n367\n00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.450\nAnd those phone numbers need to be unique,\ndon't they?\n\n368\n00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:01.360\nIf two people have the same phone number,\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n369\n00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.630\nI'm gonna call them and\nI'm gonna get both of them, right?\n\n370\n00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:04.870\nThat's how networking is.\n\n371\n00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:09.560\nEverybody has to have a unique individual\nnumber and that's what IP does.\n\n372\n00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.390\nAnd with IP we can do routing\nto find those numbers,\n\n373\n00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:16.610\nto get out there on the network and locate\nthe person that we're trying to talk to.\n\n374\n00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.100\nTCP comes next.\n\n375\n00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.120\nI know it's first in the name\njust because it sounds better but\n\n376\n00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.620\nit actually comes after IP.\n\n377\n00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.630\nAnd what TCP does is\nit's the transmission.\n\n378\n00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:28.710\nOnce I've found Daniel,\n\n379\n00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.970\nonce I've gotten connected to Daniel,\nhow do I share information with him?\n\n380\n00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.840\nTCP is what handles that.\n\n381\n00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.190\nIt handles me sending packets, frames,\n\n382\n00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.150\ndata, sending that data over to Daniel and\nmaking sure it gets there.\n\n383\n00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:46.170\nAnd if it doesn't get there, it makes sure\nthat I resend it so that it does, right?\n\n384\n00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.090\nIt tries to do what's\ncalled guaranteed delivery.\n\n385\n00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:52.080\nIf I think I've sent something, then it\nactually gets to where it's going, right?\n\n386\n00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.560\nThat's what TCP does.\n\n387\n00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.410\nAnd the two of those together allow us\nto establish communications to anyone on\n\n388\n00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.380\nthe entire planet, right?\n\n389\n00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.630\nBecause everybody is\nrunning TCP/IP these days.\n\n390\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.240\nIf somebody's not running TCP/IP,\nthey're running something proprietary and\n\n391\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.600\nwe probably won't be able to talk to them\nunless we run that same proprietary thing,\n\n392\n00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.760\nbut that's why this one's kind of been\nstandardized and we see it everywhere.\n\n393\n00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.460\nNow, Don, you said that everyone\nhas to have a unique IP address.\n\n394\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.443\nRight?\nThat's how you know who is who.\n\n395\n00:19:19.443 --> 00:19:23.931\nBut I know I've been on networks and\nI look at the IP information and\n\n396\n00:19:23.931 --> 00:19:29.222\nit's 192168.1.1 and then I go home and\nI buy a new wireless router,\n\n397\n00:19:29.222 --> 00:19:34.546\nI plug it in and I go to configuration\npage and it's 192.168.1.1.\n\n398\n00:19:34.546 --> 00:19:38.120\n[LAUGH] You're telling me that\nthey can have the same address but\n\n399\n00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.710\nthat they can't have a same address.\n\n400\n00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.310\nHow the heck does that work out?\n\n401\n00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.350\nAll right, so to understand that we\nneed to understand a little bit about\n\n402\n00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.730\nhow the IP addresses work okay.\n\n403\n00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:50.407\nSo let's take, we'll take your example\nthat you gave, that 192.168.1.1.\n\n404\n00:19:50.407 --> 00:19:53.326\nAnd we'll kind of build on that and\ntalk about where it's coming from.\n\n405\n00:19:53.326 --> 00:19:56.444\nNow one thing that I do want to throw out\nbecause this gets a little bit complex,\n\n406\n00:19:56.444 --> 00:19:59.940\nthere's actually two different versions\nof IP and Mac OS supports both of them.\n\n407\n00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.590\nSo let me just go back\nto our notes here and\n\n408\n00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:06.440\nwe'll say that there's IP version 4 and\nIP version 6.\n\n409\n00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.910\nNow, there is no IP version 1, 2,\n3, and there is no IP version 5.\n\n410\n00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.920\nSo they're really just two,\nversion 4 and version 6.\n\n411\n00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.679\n1, 2, and 3 were all proof of concepts\nthat never made into production,\n\n412\n00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:20.990\nIP version 5 actually turned out\nbe trademarked by some company.\n\n413\n00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.850\nSo they had to skip it and go to IP\nversion 6, and that's where we are today.\n\n414\n00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.408\nSo there's two protocols\nthat are out there.\n\n415\n00:20:27.408 --> 00:20:32.273\nIP version 4, is the one that odds are\nevery one of you are running right now.\n\n416\n00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:37.030\nI mean 99.9% of the people that\nare establishing TCP/IP based networks\n\n417\n00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.690\nare running IP version 4.\n\n418\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.780\nBut it is the older of the two protocols.\n\n419\n00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.900\nAnd IP version 6 is being\ncreated to replace IPv4,\n\n420\n00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.610\nto take over and become the new standard.\n\n421\n00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:52.170\nAnd it's slowly been doing that, right.\n\n422\n00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:56.130\nMost systems support IPv6, but\npeople aren't using it, all right.\n\n423\n00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.340\nAnd even in Mac OS you'll see that\nthe default is it's turned on but\n\n424\n00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.610\nit's not being used.\n\n425\n00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.290\nSo this is one that's kind\nof coming in the future.\n\n426\n00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:07.420\nSo the address Daniel gave,\nhe mentioned 192.168.1.1.\n\n427\n00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.750\nAll right, that's an IP version 4 address.\n\n428\n00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.160\nAnd I know that because\nof the way it's written.\n\n429\n00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.630\nIP version 4 addresses are written as\nfour numbers separated by periods.\n\n430\n00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:18.260\nOkay?\n\n431\n00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.430\nThey call this a dotted decimal number.\n\n432\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.630\nIt's four decimal numbers and\nthey're separated by, well, dots.\n\n433\n00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:25.310\nRight?\nDotted decimal.\n\n434\n00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.045\nSo, there's four numbers.\n\n435\n00:21:27.045 --> 00:21:29.788\n192.168.1.1.\n\n436\n00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:31.960\nEach number means something.\n\n437\n00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.500\nBut just based on this right here,\nI don't really know what they mean.\n\n438\n00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.135\nSo these numbers are normally provided\nwith what's called a subnet mask.\n\n439\n00:21:40.135 --> 00:21:45.716\nSomething like this, 255.255.255.0.\n\n440\n00:21:45.716 --> 00:21:46.420\nThat's a subnet mask.\n\n441\n00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:51.321\nAnd when we assign a net work address,\nso like if I look at my network here,\n\n442\n00:21:51.321 --> 00:21:53.075\nmy thunderbolt adapter.\n\n443\n00:21:53.075 --> 00:21:56.520\nSee how I'm 10.1.230.132.\n\n444\n00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.178\nAnd my subnet mask is 255.255.255.0,\nright?\n\n445\n00:22:00.178 --> 00:22:02.760\nI've got that subnet mask that's\nassociated with my number.\n\n446\n00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.490\nThat's important because it\ntells me about that number.\n\n447\n00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.430\nIt tells me additional\ninformation that I need\n\n448\n00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.970\nin order to figure out what\nthat address is, all right?\n\n449\n00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:17.200\nAnd what it's telling me is what\npart of this is the network ID and\n\n450\n00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.890\nwhat part of this is the host ID, right?\n\n451\n00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:23.210\nSo every IPv4 address is made up two\npieces, the network ID and the host ID.\n\n452\n00:22:24.265 --> 00:22:26.020\nThink of them as a street address, right?\n\n453\n00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:30.220\nSo the ITProTv studios,\nif you were to want to come visit us,\n\n454\n00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.600\nwe are at 6933 NW 4th Blvd.\n\n455\n00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:41.070\nOkay?\n6933, that is our building number.\n\n456\n00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.060\nRight?\n\n457\n00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.605\nSo our building has the number 6933.\n\n458\n00:22:45.605 --> 00:22:51.670\nAnd NW 4th Blvd,\nthat is our street name right?\n\n459\n00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.930\nSo the street that we're on.\n\n460\n00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:57.330\nNow there are many\nbuildings on the street.\n\n461\n00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:00.460\nSo, I can think of at least\n12 that are on NW 4th Blvd.\n\n462\n00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.640\nHow do we know one building from another?\n\n463\n00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.060\nIf I tell you, hey, you can visit the\nITProTV studios, just come to NW 4th Blvd.\n\n464\n00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.150\nWell, there could be\nhundreds of buildings,\n\n465\n00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.110\nthousands of buildings on NW 4th Blvd,\ndepending on how long it is.\n\n466\n00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.752\nTurns out it's a pretty short road,\nit's about 12 buildings.\n\n467\n00:23:15.752 --> 00:23:20.280\nWell, I tell you additional information,\n6933.\n\n468\n00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.401\nFind 4th boulevard, and once your on it,\njust look for building number 6933,\n\n469\n00:23:24.401 --> 00:23:25.977\nyou'll find us, there we are.\n\n470\n00:23:25.977 --> 00:23:31.746\nWe're the only 6933 on NW 4th Blvd,\nall right.\n\n471\n00:23:31.746 --> 00:23:38.210\nThere might be 6935, there might be 6931,\nbut there's only one 6933.\n\n472\n00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:44.638\nWell, on this street there might\nbe a 6933 NW 5th Blvd, right?\n\n473\n00:23:44.638 --> 00:23:49.066\nThat may happen and there may\ncertainly be a 6931 NW 4th Blvd and\n\n474\n00:23:49.066 --> 00:23:54.285\nyou'll see how these addresses are close\nbut they're not identical, right?\n\n475\n00:23:54.285 --> 00:23:57.179\nThere's something different.\nWe don't have two buildings with the exact\n\n476\n00:23:57.179 --> 00:23:58.075\nsame address.\n\n477\n00:23:58.075 --> 00:24:00.376\nThat's something we have to prevent,\nall right?\n\n478\n00:24:00.376 --> 00:24:03.950\nSo when it comes to network numbers,\nnetwork numbers are the same way.\n\n479\n00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:07.360\nYou don't want two people on the same\nnetwork with the same IP address.\n\n480\n00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.500\nThat would cause problems and\nthings would break.\n\n481\n00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.990\nThings wouldn't work right.\n\n482\n00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.200\nSo we have to have unique addresses.\n\n483\n00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.060\nNow, in an address,\nthinking in like the streets, right?\n\n484\n00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.100\nWe have a building number and\na street name.\n\n485\n00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.570\nThe street name is something\nI share with other people.\n\n486\n00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.460\nThe building number is unique to me.\n\n487\n00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.460\nThat's how IP addresses are.\n\n488\n00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.800\nIf we look at Daniel's address and\nmy address, so\n\n489\n00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:34.260\nif we look at the 192.168.1.1,\nthis subnet mask, where there's a 255,\n\n490\n00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.960\nthat's telling me that's the network ID,\nthat's like the street.\n\n491\n00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.716\nAnd then the zero, that's the host ID,\nthat's the computer, that's unique.\n\n492\n00:24:42.716 --> 00:24:49.705\nSo 192.168.1 is a common network a network\nthat might have hundreds of machines.\n\n493\n00:24:49.705 --> 00:24:52.283\nBut .1, that's a single person.\n\n494\n00:24:52.283 --> 00:24:54.883\nThat's one person, they should\nbe the only person that has it.\n\n495\n00:24:54.883 --> 00:24:58.711\nSo there might be a 192.168.1.12.\n\n496\n00:24:58.711 --> 00:25:04.964\nA 192.168.1.250,\nthere might be something like that.\n\n497\n00:25:04.964 --> 00:25:08.765\nBut at the end of the day,\nthere's only one .1, there's only one .12,\n\n498\n00:25:08.765 --> 00:25:12.353\nthere's only one .250, they just\nhappen to be on the same network.\n\n499\n00:25:12.353 --> 00:25:15.640\nNow if you're on the same network,\nyou can talk to each other.\n\n500\n00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.170\nThese two laptops or desktops or\nwhatever, they can talk to each other.\n\n501\n00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.860\nThat's no big deal.\n\n502\n00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.223\nBut look at my address down here,\nI'm 10.01.230.\n\n503\n00:25:23.223 --> 00:25:26.609\nMy network ID is 255.255.255, so\n\n504\n00:25:26.609 --> 00:25:32.354\nmy network ID is 10.1.230\nthat doesn't match 192.168.1.\n\n505\n00:25:32.354 --> 00:25:34.257\nThat means I'm on a different network.\n\n506\n00:25:34.257 --> 00:25:37.090\nDaniel's on one network, I'm on another.\n\n507\n00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:40.600\nWe can't talk to each other, I don't\nknow how to get to him, I can't get\n\n508\n00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.900\nto Daniel's computer to talk to it, he\ncan't get to my computer and talk to it.\n\n509\n00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.490\nWe can't see each other,\nat least, not without some help.\n\n510\n00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.500\nAnd that help comes in\nthe form of a router.\n\n511\n00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.670\nA router can sit in between networks and\nhelp us to see each other.\n\n512\n00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.940\nWe can see each other and\ncommunicate going through the router.\n\n513\n00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.610\nAnd so when we connect to the Internet,\nsomewhere in your building you will likely\n\n514\n00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.890\nhave a router just connecting\nyou to the Internet.\n\n515\n00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.931\nSo you can find the whole\nrest of the world,\n\n516\n00:26:04.931 --> 00:26:08.661\notherwise you're just all by your\nlonesome- It's like Waze for the Internet.\n\n517\n00:26:08.661 --> 00:26:11.738\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nexcept it doesn't give the police reports.\n\n518\n00:26:11.738 --> 00:26:12.922\nYeah, it doesn't give the [LAUGH].\n\n519\n00:26:12.922 --> 00:26:15.070\nCaution, vehicle on the side of the road.\n\n520\n00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.970\nBut you gotta find your way and\nthe router is what does it, all right.\n\n521\n00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:23.750\nNow Daniel mentioned hey, sometimes\nI see 192.168.1.1 on one device and\n\n522\n00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.760\nthen I see it on another\ndevice somewhere else.\n\n523\n00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.757\nSo maybe at Dan's house he has\na router that's 192.168.1.1 and\n\n524\n00:26:29.757 --> 00:26:33.015\nat my house I have a router\nthat's 192.168.1.1.\n\n525\n00:26:33.015 --> 00:26:35.530\nAren't they using the same address?\n\n526\n00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:36.840\nWell, they are.\n\n527\n00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.870\nIt actually stems from a little bit\nof a problem we have with IPv4.\n\n528\n00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:44.604\nWhen we look at these addresses,\nlet me see if we can't break this down.\n\n529\n00:26:44.604 --> 00:26:46.732\nAnd I don't want to get too crazy\ntechnical on this stuff, so\n\n530\n00:26:46.732 --> 00:26:49.920\nI'm trying to hold it to what's on\nthe exam, but this can actually turn up.\n\n531\n00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.699\nWhen you've got an address\nlike 192.168.1.1,\n\n532\n00:26:53.699 --> 00:26:55.929\nI mentioned it's dotted decimal.\n\n533\n00:26:55.929 --> 00:26:57.994\nDotted decimal is how\nwe as humans see this.\n\n534\n00:26:57.994 --> 00:27:00.400\nThis is a number that we can remember.\n\n535\n00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.680\nBut the computer is gonna take it and\nturn it into binary.\n\n536\n00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.930\nAnd what you've actually got\nare four eight-bit binary values.\n\n537\n00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:15.983\nAll right, if I were to write this\nthe way the computer sees it,\n\n538\n00:27:15.983 --> 00:27:20.438\nthe computer sees this as, let's see it's,\n\n539\n00:27:20.438 --> 00:27:24.569\n11000000.10101000.\n\n540\n00:27:24.569 --> 00:27:28.065\nYou might have to fact-check me on this\none Daniel, but I think I got it right.\n\n541\n00:27:28.065 --> 00:27:28.813\nI think you're right.\n\n542\n00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:31.840\nThis is what happens when\nI do binary in my head.\n\n543\n00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.640\nThere we go.\n\n544\n00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.470\nAll right, so\nthis is what the computer sees.\n\n545\n00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.358\nAnd in reality,\nthe computer even sees that a little bit\n\n546\n00:27:38.358 --> 00:27:41.676\ndifferent because the dots are just\nthere for our convenience so\n\n547\n00:27:41.676 --> 00:27:44.087\nthe computer really sees\nit without the dots.\n\n548\n00:27:44.087 --> 00:27:49.330\nWhat it sees is that number as 32 1s and\n0s.\n\n549\n00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:50.900\n32 bits, right?\n\n550\n00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:55.650\nIt's a 32 bit number, right?\n\n551\n00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.900\nSo an IPv4 address is 32 bits.\n\n552\n00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:03.620\nNow if you think of this in binary,\neach bit can only be at 1 or a 0.\n\n553\n00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.257\nBut there's various\ncombinations you can have.\n\n554\n00:28:05.257 --> 00:28:06.824\nAll right,\nlet's say we had a 2 bit number.\n\n555\n00:28:06.824 --> 00:28:11.421\nA 2 bit number, so\nI'm just gonna take a 2 bit number here,\n\n556\n00:28:11.421 --> 00:28:17.210\nI could have 00, I could have 01,\nI could have 10, I could have 11.\n\n557\n00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:19.760\nA 2 bit number only has four combinations.\n\n558\n00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.718\nHow many combinations does\na 32 bit number have?\n\n559\n00:28:22.718 --> 00:28:25.022\nRight, well if you're trying\nto crunch it in your mind,\n\n560\n00:28:25.022 --> 00:28:26.280\nhere I'll save you some time.\n\n561\n00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.311\nIt's roughly 4.3 billion.\n\n562\n00:28:28.311 --> 00:28:34.447\nIt's actually 4 billion,\nI've got it written down 200,\n\n563\n00:28:34.447 --> 00:28:40.025\nI'm gonna cheat here, 4,294,967,295.\n\n564\n00:28:40.025 --> 00:28:41.464\nLike Rainman, Don, amazing.\n\n565\n00:28:41.464 --> 00:28:42.683\nI didn't even know that.\n\n566\n00:28:42.683 --> 00:28:45.170\nSo it's because I know\nhow to use a printer.\n\n567\n00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:52.560\nSo any how, so that is what a 32 bit\nnumber can give us, 4.3 billion addresses.\n\n568\n00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.284\nWhen they were creating the Internet,\nwhen they were creating TCPIP, just IP in\n\n569\n00:28:56.284 --> 00:29:01.140\ngeneral, when they were creating it, this\nwas back in the late 70s and early 1980s.\n\n570\n00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.230\nBack then, how big was a computer?\n\n571\n00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.240\nMost of them were gigantic.\n\n572\n00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.040\nThe personal computer was\nreally just coming out.\n\n573\n00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.886\nThe Apple Lisa was coming\nout around that time.\n\n574\n00:29:07.886 --> 00:29:10.180\nAnd that was when they were\nfinally getting to be small.\n\n575\n00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.220\nBut the Internet really didn't exist.\n\n576\n00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.750\nWhen people wanted to\nconnected to somebody else,\n\n577\n00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.410\nthey dialed up a phone modem.\n\n578\n00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.600\nRight, they hooked the phone up to their\ncomputer, it sounds archaic, doesn't it?\n\n579\n00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.080\nWe were all doing this just a handful of\nyears ago, but they would connect via\n\n580\n00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.590\nphone modem and it would be a point\nto point connection, just two people.\n\n581\n00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.720\nNobody, ever envisioned the Internet\nbeing this global network with\n\n582\n00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.083\nmillions upon millions of\npeople on it at any given time.\n\n583\n00:29:33.083 --> 00:29:35.103\nThey just didn't see that coming.\n\n584\n00:29:35.103 --> 00:29:38.683\nSo at the time, the world's population\nwas around 4.3 billion, and\n\n585\n00:29:38.683 --> 00:29:42.170\nthey created an addressing scheme\nto have 4.3 billion addresses.\n\n586\n00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:43.930\nThat made sense.\n\n587\n00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.711\nMaybe one day, everybody will\nhave their own computer, maybe.\n\n588\n00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:49.624\nRight, these people were trying\nto predict the future, and\n\n589\n00:29:49.624 --> 00:29:51.320\nthey did the best they could.\n\n590\n00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.130\nThey just didn't see\nwhat was gonna happen.\n\n591\n00:29:53.130 --> 00:30:00.374\nThey didn't know that in the year 2016\neverybody was going to have a cellphone,\n\n592\n00:30:00.374 --> 00:30:04.670\na tablet, a laptop,\na smart watch, a smart car.\n\n593\n00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:05.907\nSmart TV.\n\n594\n00:30:05.907 --> 00:30:08.165\nYeah, TVs Rokus.\n\n595\n00:30:08.165 --> 00:30:09.778\nYou name it.\nMillions of objects.\n\n596\n00:30:09.778 --> 00:30:13.840\nThink about the amount of network\ndevices that you have in your own home.\n\n597\n00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.330\nIt's not that one person\nhas one device anymore.\n\n598\n00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:20.095\nHey, I personally have at least five\ndevices that need addresses to talk on\n\n599\n00:30:20.095 --> 00:30:20.829\nthe network.\n\n600\n00:30:20.829 --> 00:30:22.826\nSo 4.3 billion's just not enough.\n\n601\n00:30:22.826 --> 00:30:24.670\nWe run out of addresses.\n\n602\n00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:27.010\nAnd it was this threat that they\nrecognized pretty early on.\n\n603\n00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:31.080\nThey actually recognized it in I'd say\nthe mid 90s was where it really kind of\n\n604\n00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.854\nstarted reaching a fever pitch,\nwhere people said,\n\n605\n00:30:33.854 --> 00:30:35.535\nhey we're gonna run out of IPs.\n\n606\n00:30:35.535 --> 00:30:38.217\nAnd so they had to come up with\na solution, a way to get around that.\n\n607\n00:30:38.217 --> 00:30:41.364\nWell they came up with\na solution called IPv6.\n\n608\n00:30:41.364 --> 00:30:45.240\nIPv6 creates a massive address base.\n\n609\n00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:51.480\nInstead of a 32 bit number it uses\na 128 bit number, a massive number.\n\n610\n00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:57.290\nAnd it creates so many addresses,\nit's hard to fathom, right?\n\n611\n00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.505\nI've got it in the show notes.\n\n612\n00:30:59.505 --> 00:31:02.770\nThe number, it doesn't even have a name.\n\n613\n00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:07.540\nIt's so insanely long that it's not\neven necessarily worth me typing it out.\n\n614\n00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.070\nLet's put it in terms\nthat make sense to us,\n\n615\n00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.090\nsomething that our human minds can grasp,\nright.\n\n616\n00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:16.840\nSo I see that IPv4 has an address\nbase of 4.3 billion addresses,\n\n617\n00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.172\nright, roughly 4.3 billion.\n\n618\n00:31:19.172 --> 00:31:23.764\nThe Earth's population is floating\na little bit over 6 billion right now.\n\n619\n00:31:23.764 --> 00:31:28.843\nThe IPv6 address base is so big that\nevery single person on the planet,\n\n620\n00:31:28.843 --> 00:31:33.161\nall 6 billion people,\ncould have not just one address, but\n\n621\n00:31:33.161 --> 00:31:36.830\neach person could have\n4.3 billion addresses.\n\n622\n00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:40.811\nI could take all 6 billion people and\nI can give every one of them 4.3 billion\n\n623\n00:31:40.811 --> 00:31:44.200\naddresses, and\nstill have plenty of room left over.\n\n624\n00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.806\nThat's how big the IPv6 address base is.\n\n625\n00:31:45.806 --> 00:31:47.071\nIt's massive, all right.\n\n626\n00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:51.001\nSo with an address base that large, we're\nnever gonna run out of addresses, right?\n\n627\n00:31:51.001 --> 00:31:55.905\n[LAUGH] Well that's the stuff we say I\ncan't wait to see that clip 20 years\n\n628\n00:31:55.905 --> 00:31:56.446\nfrom now.\n\n629\n00:31:56.446 --> 00:31:59.576\n[LAUGH] But Don said Well Don's a moran.\n\n630\n00:31:59.576 --> 00:32:02.540\n640k memory is plenty right?\n\n631\n00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.410\nSo that's what happens\nthe IBP 60 space is massive.\n\n632\n00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:10.150\nIt's big right and\nas a result the addresses are big to.\n\n633\n00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:14.920\nSo for example, the address\nthat Dano gave the 192.168.101,\n\n634\n00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:20.000\nthat's a pretty good\nexample of a IPv4 address.\n\n635\n00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.590\nAn IPv6 address is gonna look\na little more like this.\n\n636\n00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:33.180\nLet's just say like,\nI'm sorry I didn't run it.\n\n637\n00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:37.106\nRandomly coming up with-\nHexidecimal numbers.\n\n638\n00:32:37.106 --> 00:32:39.038\nYeah.\nIt's kind of hard, good point though so\n\n639\n00:32:39.038 --> 00:32:42.620\nwhile I'm stalling with this here,\nDaniel mentioned it's hexidecimal.\n\n640\n00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:46.280\nYou'll notice as I'm typing\nthis IPv6 address that it's\n\n641\n00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.192\ngot letters in the darn thing, all right.\n\n642\n00:32:49.192 --> 00:32:54.140\nWell IPv4 used binary ones and\nzeros, and we turned it into\n\n643\n00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.890\ndecimal which is what we read as\nhumans decimal is zero through nine.\n\n644\n00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:58.880\nRight?\nEvery digit is going to be\n\n645\n00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.000\nzero through nine.\n\n646\n00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.240\nHexadecimal is zero through F.\n\n647\n00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.710\nIt goes zero through nine and\nthen A through F.\n\n648\n00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:09.200\nSo, you actually have 16 values for\neach digit.\n\n649\n00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.510\nThat's partly how it can have an address\nspace as large as it is 16 values for\n\n650\n00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.510\neach digit.\n\n651\n00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:14.920\nAnd then the address rattles on.\n\n652\n00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.600\nIn fact,\nwhy am I even trying to invent one,\n\n653\n00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.830\nlet me just show you the one\non my actual laptop.\n\n654\n00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:23.880\nOn my laptop here, if I just do a quick IF\nconfig, it'll pull up my interfaces and as\n\n655\n00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.810\nI look at my interfaces here, you can see\nwhere I'm got a ton of addresses, right?\n\n656\n00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:30.810\nBecause I've got too\nmany network adapters.\n\n657\n00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:34.060\nBut here's 192.169.41.1,\nthat's an IPv4 address.\n\n658\n00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.779\nRight beneath it I can see\n\n659\n00:33:36.779 --> 00:33:42.353\nfe80::8da:363f:7e81:4c6 that\n\n660\n00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:46.896\nright there, that's an IPv6 address.\n\n661\n00:33:46.896 --> 00:33:48.454\nIt's much longer,\nit's much harder to remember.\n\n662\n00:33:48.454 --> 00:33:52.400\nIt's not like phone number that you can\njust remember, it's a long address.\n\n663\n00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.220\nAnd, as a result,\n\n664\n00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.010\nthey're very difficult to work with and\na lot of people hate them.\n\n665\n00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.840\nBut they serve a specific purpose.\n\n666\n00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.680\nThey give us enough IPs that we'll never\nhave to worry about running out of IPs,\n\n667\n00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.890\nand we'll have plenty,\nthat's what their purpose is.\n\n668\n00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.360\nBut the addresses are so\nhard to work with and\n\n669\n00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.290\nwe normally just let the network\nassign them for us automatically.\n\n670\n00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:10.720\nWe don't get involved with\nthem as much as we with IPv4.\n\n671\n00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.310\nIPv4, the numbers are easy to remember,\nso some people manually put them in.\n\n672\n00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.990\nBut, you can just learn\nthem from the network.\n\n673\n00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:18.400\nThat, that's usually the easier way to go.\n\n674\n00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.820\nSo those are IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and\n\n675\n00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.910\neach one is kind of serves\na different purpose, right?\n\n676\n00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:31.320\nThey both provide IP functionality,\nwhich we need.\n\n677\n00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.510\nIt lets us find other people\non a different network.\n\n678\n00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:38.210\nBut they provide different\nsize address basis right?\n\n679\n00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.080\nOtherwise they are kinda\nproviding that same functionality.\n\n680\n00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.700\nAll right.\n\n681\n00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:44.240\nWhen we go to set up a network,the\nwhole point of this episode\n\n682\n00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.400\nis that when we go set up a network in\nMac OS we are gonna be using TCPIP.\n\n683\n00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.610\nThat's the standard protocol that\neverybody's using, Mac, Windows,\n\n684\n00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:53.690\nLinux that's what's out there.\n\n685\n00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.616\nYou may or may not have to configure those\naddresses and you may have to go and\n\n686\n00:34:56.616 --> 00:34:57.275\npunch those in.\n\n687\n00:34:57.275 --> 00:35:00.006\nNow Daniel mentioned,\nI think it was three times,\n\n688\n00:35:00.006 --> 00:35:03.522\nhe mentioned that shared address\nwhere does that come into play.\n\n689\n00:35:03.522 --> 00:35:07.919\nWell, IPv4 is not big enough,\nwe've run out of addresses.\n\n690\n00:35:07.919 --> 00:35:11.421\nAs of now, the central agency that\nissues the addresses is run out,\n\n691\n00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:15.240\nthey've run out of addresses,\nyou can still get them, there out there.\n\n692\n00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.769\nBut the central place is out.\n\n693\n00:35:17.769 --> 00:35:19.060\nThey came up with a replacement, IPv6.\n\n694\n00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:22.560\nIt's big, so\nwe're all running it now, right?\n\n695\n00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.100\nNo.\nEven though we've run out,\n\n696\n00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.310\npeople are still dragging their feet.\n\n697\n00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:27.630\nAnd the main reason is thanks to 1999.\n\n698\n00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:32.060\nBack in 1999,\nwe had that dot.com boom, right?\n\n699\n00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.820\nIf you were involved in computers back\nthen, or if you just liked football.\n\n700\n00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.940\nAll you have to do is remember\nthe Super Bowl from 1999.\n\n701\n00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:42.060\nAnd there were commercials for\npets.com and all these Internet start ups.\n\n702\n00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.040\nAnd they weren't making any money but\n\n703\n00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.290\nthey were making millions\nof dollars from investors.\n\n704\n00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.610\nAnd they were taking those millions\nof dollars they were getting,\n\n705\n00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:51.495\nbillions of dollars they were getting and\ndumping them into the The IPv4\n\n706\n00:35:51.495 --> 00:35:55.115\ninfrastructure of the Internet to bolster\nit up so they could have their online\n\n707\n00:35:55.115 --> 00:35:58.742\nstores that all completely failed a year\nlater, with the exception of Amazon.\n\n708\n00:35:58.742 --> 00:36:01.105\n[LAUGH] So that's what was going on.\n\n709\n00:36:01.105 --> 00:36:05.919\nWell, after the dot-com bubble burst and\nall of those companies closed up shop,\n\n710\n00:36:05.919 --> 00:36:10.524\nthe Internet service providers of\nthe world had great, amazing, brand new,\n\n711\n00:36:10.524 --> 00:36:14.851\nshiny hardware that could handle way\nmore traffic than they ever needed,\n\n712\n00:36:14.851 --> 00:36:16.350\nall built around IPv4.\n\n713\n00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:20.970\nAnd they said, let's stall, let's delay,\nlet's not go to IPv6 just yet.\n\n714\n00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.400\nLet's run IPv4 so we can get our\nmoney's worth out of the hardware.\n\n715\n00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.440\nWell here we are 16,\n17 years later and they're still\n\n716\n00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.260\ntrying to get their money's worth out of\nhardware they're not even running anymore,\n\n717\n00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.320\nso it's kind of BS, right.\n\n718\n00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.240\nBut they just, they're not being\npushed to make the change.\n\n719\n00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.770\nAnd they're not making the change.\n\n720\n00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:41.270\nSo you'll still see IPv4\nused very commonly.\n\n721\n00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:43.990\nSo if we're out of\naddresses what do we do?\n\n722\n00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:48.640\nWell they set aside specific networks\nthat were available for private use,\n\n723\n00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.970\nthat you can use privately that\nare not allowed to go on the internet.\n\n724\n00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.290\nAnd you can use them to your heart's\ncontent inside of your own networks.\n\n725\n00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:57.560\nYou don't have to worry about having IPs.\n\n726\n00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.530\nYou've got these reserved ranges.\n\n727\n00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.390\nBut other people are using them too.\n\n728\n00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:03.600\nAnd if you want to go out on the Internet,\n\n729\n00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.680\nsomebody has to change your address\nfrom a fake address to a real address.\n\n730\n00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.360\nAnd that's something your router can do.\n\n731\n00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.360\nMost routers these days run what's called\nnetwork address translation, or NAT.\n\n732\n00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.170\nAnd they take your fake address and\n\n733\n00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.390\nthey turn it into a real one\nas you go out on the Internet.\n\n734\n00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:20.510\nAnd all the computers on your network\nwill share that one real address.\n\n735\n00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:24.310\nAnd that way you can have 100\ncomputers with one real address.\n\n736\n00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:26.450\nBut they've all got their fake\naddresses behind the scene, and\n\n737\n00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:27.380\nthey're easy to spot.\n\n738\n00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.600\nSo let me go back to my\nlittle slide thing here.\n\n739\n00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.820\nSo, in IPv4 you can spot fake addresses\nbecause they all follow a certain\n\n740\n00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.060\npattern, right?\n\n741\n00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.965\nThere's addresses that start with 10.\n\n742\n00:37:36.965 --> 00:37:40.100\n.x.x.x right, so 10 dot whatever.\n\n743\n00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.070\nIf you see that, that's a fake address.\n\n744\n00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.055\nRemember my laptop?\n\n745\n00:37:44.055 --> 00:37:46.170\n10.1.230.132?\nIt's a fake address, all right.\n\n746\n00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:54.100\nIf they start with 172.16 all\n\n747\n00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:59.310\nthe way through 172.31.x.x,\nthose are fake addresses.\n\n748\n00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:03.340\nWould it be better to say that they are\nnon-routeable addresses, not fake [LAUGH]?\n\n749\n00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.960\nAll right, we'll use the official terms.\n\n750\n00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.220\nAll right, so\nlet me throw out the last range and\n\n751\n00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.930\nthen I'll get all official on you guys.\n\n752\n00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.470\nSo the other range is 192.168.x.x.\n\n753\n00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:15.330\nSo if you see anything in these three\nranges, They're what I'm gonna call fake.\n\n754\n00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:19.283\nBut the official terms,\nthis is all defined RFC 1918.\n\n755\n00:38:19.283 --> 00:38:22.810\nSo that's an IEEE standard that\nwas created to define these.\n\n756\n00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:29.540\nAnd what they defined was the difference\nbetween public and private addresses.\n\n757\n00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:34.370\nThese addresses are what\nare called private addresses.\n\n758\n00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:38.220\nYou can use them privately in the comfort\nof your own home or business.\n\n759\n00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.090\nBut they're not allowed\nout on the Internet,\n\n760\n00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.070\nthey're not allowed to go out\nthere on the public side.\n\n761\n00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.400\nSo I call them fake but\nthey're not really fake.\n\n762\n00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.620\nThey are real IPs, they're just private,\nthey're not allowed to be sent out.\n\n763\n00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.220\nThe official terminology by the Apple.\n\n764\n00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.125\nWhich one of these are fake?\n\n765\n00:38:51.125 --> 00:38:52.410\n[LAUGH] Which are fake?\n\n766\n00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.989\nSo Yeah, you probably won't see\nthem called fake all right.\n\n767\n00:38:54.989 --> 00:38:57.840\n[LAUGH] All right so private,\nprivate's what we call it.\n\n768\n00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.140\nBut on the public side that's\neverything else, right.\n\n769\n00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.320\nEverything else that's outside of\nthese ranges is considered public and\n\n770\n00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.690\nis routable on the Internet.\n\n771\n00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.970\nSo while my laptop might have a fake IP,\n\n772\n00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:10.780\nwhen I go out to the Internet,\nI'm getting translated to something else.\n\n773\n00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:15.342\nSo for example if I go to\na website like IP Monkey.\n\n774\n00:39:15.342 --> 00:39:17.410\nIP Monkey.com.\n\n775\n00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.915\nIt's telling me when I go out to\nthe internet here's my address.\n\n776\n00:39:19.915 --> 00:39:22.881\n209.251.159.179.\n\n777\n00:39:22.881 --> 00:39:24.272\nThat's not my IP.\n\n778\n00:39:24.272 --> 00:39:28.102\nWe saw my IP was 10.1.230.132.\n\n779\n00:39:28.102 --> 00:39:30.753\nWell, the router is changing\nme on the way out and\n\n780\n00:39:30.753 --> 00:39:32.954\nI'm getting this address right here and\n\n781\n00:39:32.954 --> 00:39:37.718\nthe monkey's telling me and are you gonna\nbelieve an orangutan or whatever that is?\n\n782\n00:39:37.718 --> 00:39:39.130\nIt actually has the disclaimer.\n\n783\n00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.570\nMonkey is actually an orangutan.\n\n784\n00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:41.626\nThat is too funny.\n\n785\n00:39:41.626 --> 00:39:45.609\nSo anyhow, so we're getting translated,\nand that's that important piece there,\n\n786\n00:39:45.609 --> 00:39:47.003\nis that we have that address.\n\n787\n00:39:47.003 --> 00:39:50.544\nNow In IPv6, we don't have that.\n\n788\n00:39:50.544 --> 00:39:55.100\nTechnically they do, but nobody uses it\nbecause the IPv6 address space is so big.\n\n789\n00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.540\nIt's so\nbig that everybody has tons of addresses.\n\n790\n00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:01.940\nWe dont need to use fake private\naddresses anymore and so\n\n791\n00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.420\neverybody can use public addresses.\n\n792\n00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.540\nAnd that's where we'll get in the future,\nbut\n\n793\n00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.580\nfor right now we're kind of\nreliant on this old technology.\n\n794\n00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:12.320\nRight, so that's a lot to swallow\nright there on IPv6, IPv4.\n\n795\n00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.550\nThere is one other address type\nI just wanna mention real quick.\n\n796\n00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:19.170\nWhen you're doing local\ncommunications between your systems,\n\n797\n00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.960\nyour computers have a MAC address.\n\n798\n00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.270\nAnd I wanna mention this one because\na lot of people hear it's a MAC address,\n\n799\n00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:25.500\nit's from Apple, right?\n\n800\n00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:29.420\nWell, it's not,\nit's media access control, M-A-C.\n\n801\n00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:33.580\nAnd MAC addresses are hardware addresses\nthat are burned into your network adapter.\n\n802\n00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:37.500\nAnd they're designed to be unique\nacross the globe also, all right?\n\n803\n00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.920\nBut they're not routable, you can't\nuse them to talk on the Internet.\n\n804\n00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.560\nMAC addresses don't have a network ID and\na host ID.\n\n805\n00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.770\nAll a MAC address has just it's ID,\nthat's it.\n\n806\n00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:50.850\nSo when I went into my\nterminal a minute ago and\n\n807\n00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:54.050\nI showed you guys my addresses,\nwhen you look in here,\n\n808\n00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:59.800\nyou'll actually see additional information\nsometimes about that hardware address.\n\n809\n00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:04.320\nAnd-- you know I say that-- where,\nhere's one, so if you look at my en0,\n\n810\n00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:09.810\nthat's my ethernet zero, my physical\nnetwork jack, it's got 10.1.230.241,\n\n811\n00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:14.280\nI actually got my IP wrong earlier, and\nthen there's this ethernet address.\n\n812\n00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:18.520\nThat ethernet address is my media\naccess control, my MAC address.\n\n813\n00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.900\nAnd when I talk to other\ncomputers on the same network,\n\n814\n00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.340\nI can use that address to talk.\n\n815\n00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.310\nAnd it is made of two pieces, but\n\n816\n00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:29.820\nthe first piece doesn't identify the\nnetwork, it identifies who made the card.\n\n817\n00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.030\nSo if I take this address right here,\nthis is my Mac address,\n\n818\n00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:37.980\nthe last six values here,\nthat identifies my network card.\n\n819\n00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.850\nThat's me, that's Don Pizette.\n\n820\n00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:44.500\nBut the first six characters is just\nidentifying who made the thing.\n\n821\n00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.790\nWell, you can guess who that is right?\n\n822\n00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:50.500\nIf you're using a Mac,\nit's probably made by Apple right?\n\n823\n00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:55.646\nSo if I take my MAC address and punch it\nin like an OUI search, that is what they\n\n824\n00:41:55.646 --> 00:42:00.705\ncall equipment identifiers, OUI, and\nI do a search I can see right there\n\n825\n00:42:00.705 --> 00:42:05.880\n3C:15:C2 is Apple Incorporated,\nthat's who made that adapter.\n\n826\n00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.810\nRight, that's who made it,\nit's recognized right there.\n\n827\n00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:11.190\nYou might have one made by Intel or\nsomebody else.\n\n828\n00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:14.060\nIf you have a USB adapter it might show\nas being made by somebody else, but\n\n829\n00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.650\nthe one that's built into your\ncomputer will show as Apple and\n\n830\n00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:19.360\nthat's just to identify the manufacturer,\nit doesn't help with routing.\n\n831\n00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.970\nSo while MAC addresses do exist, they\nare there, we don't really use them for\n\n832\n00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:25.560\nnetwork communications\nbeyond our local network.\n\n833\n00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.890\nWell Don, obviously networking is\na large barrel of monkeys, right?\n\n834\n00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:31.300\nThere's a lot going on in there.\n\n835\n00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.660\nWe've really just scratched\nthe surface on how we need to--\n\n836\n00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.698\nthings that we need to know to make sure\nwe can support a networked environment.\n\n837\n00:42:38.698 --> 00:42:41.760\nSo,wow, we've completely exhausted.\n\n838\n00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.820\nThis is definitely a long episode but\nit was good information.\n\n839\n00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:47.960\nThis is foundational stuff\nthat our viewers need to know.\n\n840\n00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.320\nFantastic job of demonstrating that and\nexplaining it for us.\n\n841\n00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.260\nWe appreciate it.\n\n842\n00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:51.840\nAbsolutely.\n\n843\n00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.460\nAnd we talk about addresses,\nwe never actually use them.\n\n844\n00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.770\nAt no point in this episode\ndid I use my addresses.\n\n845\n00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:00.560\nSo in the next episode, we're gonna\nsee how to apply those addresses and\n\n846\n00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.420\nactually use them, test them out,\nmake sure they're working.\n\n847\n00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:05.270\nSo we're gonna get to the little more\npractical side in the next episode.\n\n848\n00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:06.650\nYeah, really looking forward to that.\n\n849\n00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:09.280\nThanks again, Don, for stopping by,\nwe'll see you in part 2.\n\n850\n00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.960\nHopefully you guys got\na lot out of this episode,\n\n851\n00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.860\nmaybe even learned a little bit,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n852\n00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.580\nsign off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n853\n00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.420\nAnd I'm Dan Possette.\n\n854\n00:43:16.420 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:18.820\nI'm your host Daniel Lowery and\nin today's episode we're continuing on\n\n4\n00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.520\nwith a little more of that Apple\ncertified support professional,\n\n5\n00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.070\nlet me get them in the right order there.\n\n6\n00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.840\nAnd, joining us back in the studio again\ntoday to help us out a little more on\n\n7\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.660\nthe networking side is our good friend,\nMr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.150\nDon, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n9\n00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.090\n>> Thanks for having me back Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.640\nReady to dive right back into it.\n\n11\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.670\nThis is part two.\n\n12\n00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.250\nIf you watched the last episode, we talked\nabout some, kind of network fundamentals.\n\n13\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.370\nHow IP addresses work, and\nwhat they're made up of.\n\n14\n00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.970\nHow the numbers are kind of built and\nassigned.\n\n15\n00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.640\nBut we spent that whole episode and\nwe never actually used the numbers.\n\n16\n00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.450\nAnd so in this episode we're\ngonna get a little more hands on,\n\n17\n00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.030\nand we're gonna see using these addresses\nto communicate between two computers.\n\n18\n00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.820\nNow in order to get two computers to\ntalk on the network they have to be\n\n19\n00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.440\nable to see each other.\n\n20\n00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.600\nThey have to be able to communicate.\n\n21\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.360\nAnd I mentioned in the last episode,\nthey have to speak a common language.\n\n22\n00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.700\nAnd in this, today's IT world,\nTCPIP is that common language.\n\n23\n00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.340\nSo if you've got a Windows machine,\na Linux machine or\n\n24\n00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.400\na Mac, they all default to using TCPIP and\nif configured properly,\n\n25\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.320\nyour machines will see each other and\nthat's the end of the day.\n\n26\n00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.080\nEverything works, everything's great.\n\n27\n00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.440\nWell, a lot of network's leverage a neat\nprotocol that's out there called DHCP.\n\n28\n00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.260\nDHCP DHC, how do you spell DHCP?\n\n29\n00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.175\n>> I think there's a J in there,\nit's silent.\n\n30\n00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:35.590\n>> [LAUGH] A silent J, so it's stands for\ndynamic host configuration protocol.\n\n31\n00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.340\nAnd what it is,\n\n32\n00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.060\na little service that runs on your\nnetwork that helps people get addresses.\n\n33\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.440\nSo when you plug in your computer\non the network for the first time,\n\n34\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.280\nyour computer sends out a message on the\nnetwork that says hey guys I'm new here.\n\n35\n00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.620\nI'm new.\nI don't know the network.\n\n36\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.290\nI don't know the numbers,\ncan somebody help me?\n\n37\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.550\nCan somebody give me an address, please?\n\n38\n00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.670\nAnd a DHCP server on your network will\nreply back and say, hey, I'm here,\n\n39\n00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.470\nI got your back, here is an address\nyou can use, good luck on the network.\n\n40\n00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.260\nAnd your computer will\nautomatically configure itself.\n\n41\n00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.360\nAnd then you're able to talk and\ncommunicate.\n\n42\n00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.300\nAnd that's all fine and good but on the\nexam obviously it's not going to be that\n\n43\n00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.490\neasy, yeah it's done, shortest exam ever.\n\n44\n00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.840\nInstead, you're going to have to\nkinda know the manual side of it.\n\n45\n00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.160\nSo let's take a look at that process and\nsee what's going on.\n\n46\n00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.460\nNow, I've got a Mac here.\n\n47\n00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.740\nThis is a stocking stall of El Capitan,\nand I haven't really done anything to it.\n\n48\n00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.390\nI just installed it and as part of\nthe install it asked me for my name, so\n\n49\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.030\nI put my name in.\n\n50\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.660\nIt knows I'm Don Pazzet.\n\n51\n00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.800\nBut otherwise,\nit's plugged in to the network.\n\n52\n00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.030\nAnd when I fire up Safari, and\ntry and browse out to the Internet.\n\n53\n00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.650\nLet's let's see if we can\nget to the ITProTV website.\n\n54\n00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.810\nSo if I go and browse out to the Internet,\nit's gonna reach out.\n\n55\n00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.890\nAnd it gets to the website, right?\n\n56\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.950\nI didn't configure the network at all.\n\n57\n00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.930\nAll I did was plug in a cable.\n\n58\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.150\nWell, when you plug in that\ncable it needs an address and\n\n59\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.070\nit had to have gotten\nthe address from somewhere.\n\n60\n00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.580\nNow even on a wireless network or\n\n61\n00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.380\nmaybe you did have to do a little\nsomething right and the wireless network\n\n62\n00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.930\nyou might have to pick the network\nthat you're connected to right?\n\n63\n00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.490\nSo if you look at like\nmy actual laptop here.\n\n64\n00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.400\nI've got that wireless symbol up top and\nI've got all the networks that it can see,\n\n65\n00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.030\nand if I wanna connect to a network,\nif it has a little lock on it,\n\n66\n00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.850\nit's gonna ask me for a password.\n\n67\n00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.350\nAnd so I provide a password and\n\n68\n00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.950\nget connected, but then after that\nI'm connected, I'm out there,\n\n69\n00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.030\nI'm on the internet, and\neverything's working great, right?\n\n70\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.530\nBut I never see IP addresses,\ndoesn't mean I don't have an IP address,\n\n71\n00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.000\nI just didn't see it.\n\n72\n00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.890\nSo if I go in to my System Preferences,\nand I go into networking.\n\n73\n00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.699\nInside of Network I can choose my adapter,\nand I'll see those addresses, all right?\n\n74\n00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.700\nBut where do these addresses come from?\n\n75\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.110\nI got 192.168.0.150.\nWhere did I get that?\n\n76\n00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.455\n>> The magic DHCP fairy.\n\n77\n00:03:44.455 --> 00:03:45.940\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's exactly it,\n\n78\n00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.520\nthe DHCP fairy visited.\n\n79\n00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.250\nAnd I got it using DHCP dynamic\nhost configuration protocol.\n\n80\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.880\nNow, it's not a fairy, necessarily.\n\n81\n00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.770\nIt certainly could be.\n\n82\n00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.530\nBut it's more than likely some kind\nof appliance on your network and\n\n83\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.280\nit's very commonly your router.\n\n84\n00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.710\nSo in homes or small offices,\nyou normally get these wireless\n\n85\n00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.980\nrouters slash access access\npoint mega combo devices, right?\n\n86\n00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.420\nAnd you plug your broadband connection\ninto it and your whole house or\n\n87\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.480\nwhole office gets internet access.\n\n88\n00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.420\nWell, that router can do DHCP so\nit may be a DHCP server.\n\n89\n00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.960\nOr maybe you have a server\nthat's running OS 10 and\n\n90\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.430\nit's got the server app installed on it.\n\n91\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.070\nThe server app has a DHCP server too.\n\n92\n00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.990\nYou can configure it right in there and\nset it to hand out these addresses.\n\n93\n00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.130\nBut somewhere on your network, somebody\nhas to be handing out these addresses.\n\n94\n00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.500\nIt's not magic.\n\n95\n00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.120\nSomebody has to set that device up.\n\n96\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.930\nIf you don't have that device\nyour computer's going to boot up,\n\n97\n00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:36.620\nit's going to try and\n\n98\n00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.550\nget an address and it's going to fail,\nit's not going to get an address.\n\n99\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.550\nAnd at that point it's just going\nto create a placeholder address,\n\n100\n00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.720\none that it hopes works,\nbut usually doesn't.\n\n101\n00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.540\nSo we either need to have\na DHCP server helping us out or\n\n102\n00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.380\nwe need to manually specify our addresses.\n\n103\n00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.500\nWell let's see the manual side.\n\n104\n00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.290\nSo instead of using DHCP I'm gonna\ndrop it down and choose Manual, okay.\n\n105\n00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.260\nI'm gonna do a manual connection and\nwhen I do that now I can come in and\n\n106\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.060\nI can type in an address and\na Subnet Mask.\n\n107\n00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.700\nAll right.\n\n108\n00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.320\nSo if I wanna use 192.168.1.150 or\nshoot what was it?\n\n109\n00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.310\n0?\nI think it's 192, 168 at 0, 150.\n\n110\n00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.190\nI should have paid attention.\n\n111\n00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.510\nSo if I wanna use that address and\nSubnet Mask, I can type those in.\n\n112\n00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.930\nAnd so now I've got an address.\n\n113\n00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.950\nNow what if somebody else is\nalready using that address, right?\n\n114\n00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.530\nSomebody could be.\n\n115\n00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.480\nYou know what?\n\n116\n00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.200\nI've actually go another machine, so\nthis guy, let's see what happens.\n\n117\n00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.560\nSo if I take this computer, this is\nanother El Capitan machine, I've got it\n\n118\n00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.000\nset up as a server so I've turned off\nthe wallpaper and all that stuff.\n\n119\n00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.830\nThis one is 192.168.0.151.\n\n120\n00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.490\nAll right.\n\n121\n00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.080\nSo what if I take that same address.\n\n122\n00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.320\nI'm gonna take the same address and\npop that right in there, okay.\n\n123\n00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.090\nWhen I apply it,\nmy system's gonna go to use that address.\n\n124\n00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.380\nI'm using the same address\nas somebody else and so\n\n125\n00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.870\nI get a warning you can't do that.\n\n126\n00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.090\nYou can't have two people\nusing the same address.\n\n127\n00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.990\nSo it's already in use, I can't use it.\n\n128\n00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.840\nSo my network adapter\nis now kind of broken\n\n129\n00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.070\nbecause I'm using somebody else's IP.\n\n130\n00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.600\nBut if I pick an IP that's not in use.\n\n131\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.820\nLike I'll pick 152, right.\n\n132\n00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.340\nNobody else is using that,\nI can hit apply.\n\n133\n00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.370\nAnd now I'm gonna have an address and I'm\ngonna be able to talk on the network and\n\n134\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.870\nbe happy, okay?\n\n135\n00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.610\nSo it's applied,\nI've got this address and that's it.\n\n136\n00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.370\nWell, what the address lets me do,\n\n137\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.010\nis it lets me talk to anybody\nelse that's on the same network.\n\n138\n00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.884\nMy network is 192.168.0.\n\n139\n00:06:35.884 --> 00:06:39.231\nThe server is 192.168.0.\n\n140\n00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:41.008\nWe're on the same network, we can talk.\n\n141\n00:06:41.008 --> 00:06:42.670\nI'm .152.\n\n142\n00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.650\nThe server is .151.\n\n143\n00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.730\nWe should be able to see each other.\n\n144\n00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:47.390\nHow do I know?\n\n145\n00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.180\n>> You try to send information [LAUGH]\n>> Hopefully the servers doing something.\n\n146\n00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.150\nAnd we can do whatever that\nsomething is to test it out.\n\n147\n00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.240\nMaybe it's a web server, maybe it's a file\nserver, maybe it's who knows what, right?\n\n148\n00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.020\nOr we can just try and Ping it.\n\n149\n00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.510\nPing is a neat little utility that\nsends a message out on the network.\n\n150\n00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.790\nIt just says hey,\nif you're out there, reply to me.\n\n151\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.220\nJust let me know you're there, right?\n\n152\n00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.700\nIt's a way of saying hi.\n\n153\n00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.180\nSo we can use ping to test that out.\n\n154\n00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.480\nAnd there's a few ways to do it in Mac OS.\n\n155\n00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.810\nI normally drop to the terminal and do it\nfrom there cuz you have a command line\n\n156\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.230\nutility for ping but on the exam,\nthey love the GUI on the exam.\n\n157\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.750\nAnd there is a GUI utility called\nthe network utility, and we can use that.\n\n158\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.040\nSo let me fire that up here on my Mac.\n\n159\n00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.280\nSo I'm gonna go into my\napplications folder.\n\n160\n00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.120\nAnd in the applications folder you\nhave a folder called utilities.\n\n161\n00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:40.830\nAnd in utilities you have a utility in\nhere somewhere called The network utility.\n\n162\n00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.390\nAnd, you know I was pretty certain that\nit was in the, did it get moved off?\n\n163\n00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.708\nBack in Mavericks, Apple decided to start\nmoving some of the utilities off into\n\n164\n00:07:48.708 --> 00:07:51.801\nthe core services folder so it's tucked\naway under the system folder now and\n\n165\n00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:53.757\nit looks like network\nutility was one of those.\n\n166\n00:07:53.757 --> 00:07:56.273\nSo, the easier way to run it\nis just to use Spotlight.\n\n167\n00:07:56.273 --> 00:07:59.192\nSo, I'm just gonna fire up my\nSpotlight and I'll just type network.\n\n168\n00:07:59.192 --> 00:08:00.413\nAnd utility there we go.\n\n169\n00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:02.771\nSo here's my network\nutility I can fire that up.\n\n170\n00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:05.180\nAnd let's be one of the ones that got\nmoved off to the core services folder.\n\n171\n00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.280\nBut when you fire up the network utility\nyou basically see this little screen.\n\n172\n00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.950\nAnd it's a tool that has\na number of different\n\n173\n00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.440\nthings that we can use\nto test our network.\n\n174\n00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.950\nIt shows our IP address,\nit shows our MAC address,\n\n175\n00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.360\nthe hardware address assigned\nto your network adapter.\n\n176\n00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.450\nYou see the speed of your network,\nwho makes your network adopt.\n\n177\n00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.250\nYou see all these details\nabout your system.\n\n178\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.950\nAnd that's really useful just from\nthe basic troubleshooting standpoint.\n\n179\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.910\nJust to see that information.\n\n180\n00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.350\nBut I wanna ping and\nyou'll see right up here.\n\n181\n00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.450\nI've got a nice Ping button and\n\n182\n00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.590\nI'm gonna type in that server,\n192.168.0.151 I'm 192.168.0.152.\n\n183\n00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.160\nThat one is .151,\n\n184\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.640\nwe're on the same network,\nwe should be able to talk to each other.\n\n185\n00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.970\nTalk to each other no problem and\ncommunicate all right.\n\n186\n00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.790\nSo if I go and hit Ping, there it goes and\n\n187\n00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.980\nsure enough I can communicate\nwith that server.\n\n188\n00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.080\nThese little messages here, what it's\ndoing is it's saying I'm getting 64 bytes\n\n189\n00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.130\nI'm sending a message to say please reply,\n\n190\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.340\nand the other side is replying\nwith 4-bytes of data.\n\n191\n00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.720\nAnd that data is coming back and\nacknowledging the other system is online.\n\n192\n00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.420\nI can talk to it.\n\n193\n00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.760\nSo I'm now able to\ncommunicate on the network.\n\n194\n00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.910\n>> Now Don, there obviously had to be some\nother type of communication happening as\n\n195\n00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.860\nwell, because when you typed in\nthe 1921680.151, which was the same\n\n196\n00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.790\naddress as another machine it came\nback and said, hey, you can't do that.\n\n197\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.140\nIt knew that there as another machine\non that network with the same address.\n\n198\n00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.162\nhow the heck did it know that?\n\n199\n00:09:29.162 --> 00:09:32.350\n>> All right, so there are a number of\nprotocols running under the hood and\n\n200\n00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:37.120\nwe don't need to get into the deep\ndown engineering details of it all.\n\n201\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.820\nBut one of the key protocols\nyou need to be aware of is ARP.\n\n202\n00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.430\nARP is the address resolution protocol.\n\n203\n00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.280\nWhenever you go to talk to somebody,\nwhen I went to talk to 151,\n\n204\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.650\nI went to send a ping to 151.\n\n205\n00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.710\nBefore I can even do that,\nhave to know the hardware address of 151.\n\n206\n00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.160\nI have to know the Mac address.\n\n207\n00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.870\nAnd so we send out what's called an arp\nbroadcast, or an arp query, to say,\n\n208\n00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.420\nhey I'm trying to talk to this IP.\n\n209\n00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.760\nWho is it?\n\n210\n00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.020\nWho's got that and\nwhat's their Mac address?\n\n211\n00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.450\nAnd the other machine will hear that and\napply back and say, hey that's me.\n\n212\n00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.870\nYeah that's me and that's my IP\naddress and here's my Mac address,\n\n213\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.110\nhere's my hardware address and\nyou can use it to communicate with me.\n\n214\n00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:18.930\nWell when I said I was gonna use\n151 the first thing my Mac did\n\n215\n00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.400\nwas send out an ARP request for 151 and\nsay hey is anybody out there 151,\n\n216\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.760\nif you are I need to know\nyour hardware address.\n\n217\n00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.620\nAnd 151 replied cuz it was out there.\n\n218\n00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.870\nAnd when it replied my system said oops,\nsomebody's already got that address,\n\n219\n00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:31.950\nwe can't use it.\n\n220\n00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.110\nWe can't use it cuz it's\nalready in use on the network.\n\n221\n00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:38.800\nSo I never technically did use 151,\nI got an error.\n\n222\n00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.580\nBut I never actually used that address,\n\n223\n00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.800\nI saw somebody else was\nalready out there using it.\n\n224\n00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.560\nAll right so that ARP process,\nAddress Resolution Protocol,\n\n225\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.800\nit's pretty important.\n\n226\n00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.320\nWe can use it to find duplicate IPs but\n\n227\n00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.560\nwe can also use it to find\nthe person we want to talk to.\n\n228\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.450\nSo if I were to drop to my terminal.\n\n229\n00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.180\nActually, yeah, we don't have a,\nyou have a lot of tools\n\n230\n00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.050\nhere on the network utility, but\none you don't have is the ARP utility.\n\n231\n00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:06.330\nSo when I communicated to 151, I said that\nI had to do an address lookup, right?\n\n232\n00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.340\nWell, how do I know that even happened?\n\n233\n00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.320\nWell, you can run an ARP-a\nfrom the terminal.\n\n234\n00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.012\nAnd this will show you anybody\nthat you've talked to, and\n\n235\n00:11:16.012 --> 00:11:20.160\nthe Mac address you learn from them.\n\n236\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.460\nSo I talked to 192.168.0.151 and\nwhen I did,\n\n237\n00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.670\nthis is the Mac address that came back.\n\n238\n00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:30.360\nAs I talk to other people,\nI'll register their Mac addresses also.\n\n239\n00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.980\nSo as I start to talk to like,\n192.168.0.2, right,\n\n240\n00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.940\nI can take that one And\nI'll just do another arp -a.\n\n241\n00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.650\nAnd now my arp table has two entries,\none for 192.168.0.2 and\n\n242\n00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.850\nits Mac address and another one for\n192.168.0.151 and its Mac address.\n\n243\n00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:52.230\nI'm keeping track of that, and\nwhen I go to talk to those guys,\n\n244\n00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.810\nthe Mac address is part of the frame,\nthe packet that I'm gonna be sending on\n\n245\n00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:59.550\nthe network to the other side so that it\nreaches it and gets the other system.\n\n246\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.680\nAnd, it knows who it came from and\nit knows where I was going to and\n\n247\n00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.030\nwe can identify traffic that\ncomes to us that's not for us.\n\n248\n00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.840\nA frame might make it to my network\nadapter that's meant for somebody else and\n\n249\n00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.250\nso I just throw it away.\n\n250\n00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.300\nThat doesn't happen so\nmuch on physical networks anymore but\n\n251\n00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.390\non wireless networks it\nhappens all the time.\n\n252\n00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.550\nWith a wireless signal,\nthat frame is just sent out there.\n\n253\n00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.656\nI almost whacked you in the head.\n\n254\n00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just sitting right out there\n\n255\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.120\non the airwaves, right?\n\n256\n00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.890\nSo if I have a wireless\ncard in my computer,\n\n257\n00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.080\nI'm receiving not just data from me.\n\n258\n00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.980\nBut data for everybody else\nthat's on that wireless network.\n\n259\n00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.850\nAnd so when I get it I'm able to look at\nthat address and say, that's not me, and\n\n260\n00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.090\nthrow it away so that I only\ndeal with the data that I want,\n\n261\n00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.680\nunless I'm the nefarious type,\nin which case we record it all.\n\n262\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.300\nAnd then you've got everybody's traffic,\nwhich is a good time.\n\n263\n00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.090\nSo that's basically what's\ngoing on behind the scenes.\n\n264\n00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:49.010\nIt's this whole process of resolving\na network, resolving an IP and\n\n265\n00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.870\na MAC address and\nthen starting to communicate.\n\n266\n00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:56.220\nAll right, but\nI do have a little problem here.\n\n267\n00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.770\nI'm on the 192.168.0 network.\n\n268\n00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.360\nAnd my machine is .152,\nthat server is .151.\n\n269\n00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.070\nI can talk to it.\n\n270\n00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.830\nBut what if I wanna talk to somebody else?\n\n271\n00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.370\nSomebody on a completely\ndifferent network.\n\n272\n00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.270\nWell I know I said it in the last episode,\nbut I'll say it again.\n\n273\n00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:15.600\nWe need a router,\nrouters help us cross between networks.\n\n274\n00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.140\nI can't get out of my network without\nusing a router, and I don't have one.\n\n275\n00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.510\nYou probably noticed when I set up\nmy IP address here, I gave it an IP,\n\n276\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.700\nI gave it a Subnet Mask,\nI did not give it a router.\n\n277\n00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.330\nWithout a router,\nI can't get out to the internet.\n\n278\n00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:30.830\nAll right.\n\n279\n00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.540\nI can't get out to other networks.\n\n280\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.300\nSo right now, if I were to try to do\na ping to an internet address, right?\n\n281\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.220\nHere, I'll use the network\nutility like I'm supposed to.\n\n282\n00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.810\nSo let me punch in an internet address.\n\n283\n00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:43.750\n4.2.2.1.\n\n284\n00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.370\nThat's one of level three's DNS servers.\n\n285\n00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:53.140\nI'm gonna try and ping that address,\nand when I do No route to host, okay?\n\n286\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.470\nI don't have a way to get to that host,\nI can't get there, right?\n\n287\n00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.706\nI'm sending 56 bytes,\nI'm not getting anything back,\n\n288\n00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:02.109\nno route to host, can't do it, all right?\n\n289\n00:14:02.109 --> 00:14:07.518\nIf I jump over to my server and\nI fire up the old network utility,\n\n290\n00:14:07.518 --> 00:14:13.147\nand I do a ping And\nI'll ping the same address, 4.2.2.1.\n\n291\n00:14:13.147 --> 00:14:18.350\nWhen I go to ping that,\nit's getting responses, all right?\n\n292\n00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.740\nI'm on the 192168 network.\n\n293\n00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.350\nThe server is on the 192168.0 network.\n\n294\n00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.650\nIt can get to the Internet.\n\n295\n00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.730\nAnd I can't.\n\n296\n00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.340\nAnd the only difference is that I just\ndidn't tell my system what router to use.\n\n297\n00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.730\nSo that's the next piece,\n\n298\n00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.840\ncuz I need to go back to my machine and\nassign a router to use.\n\n299\n00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.070\nSo if I get into my network settings\nagain, I can punch in the router.\n\n300\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.480\nNow what's the IP address of your router?\n\n301\n00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.170\nShort answer?\nI don't know.\n\n302\n00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.551\nWhoever set up your router,\nthey picked it.\n\n303\n00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:49.610\nAnd on most networks, people default to\nusing .1, it's just kind of this habit,\n\n304\n00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.865\ncuz the router's usually the first\nthing you set up on a network, so\n\n305\n00:14:52.865 --> 00:14:53.810\nthey make it .1.\n\n306\n00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.648\nSo if I'm on the 192.168.0 network,\nit's usually a pretty safe guess,\n\n307\n00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:01.424\nthat it's gonna be 192.168.0.1.\n\n308\n00:15:01.424 --> 00:15:05.841\nBut it doesn't have to be, there's no\nrule, there's no requirement that says you\n\n309\n00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:10.030\nhave to use .1 for your router In your\nhome, do you use dot one for your router?\n\n310\n00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.930\n>> I do use dot one for my router, but\n\n311\n00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.340\nI also use the last one in that range,\nwhich that would be .254.\n\n312\n00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.340\nI've used that as well.\n\n313\n00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.150\n>> Yeah, some people do that.\n\n314\n00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.420\nSome systems default to that.\n\n315\n00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.879\nAt my home, I use .1.\n\n316\n00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:23.520\nHere at the office, we use .1.\n\n317\n00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.390\nSo, it's pretty commonly .1,\nbut don't let that fool you.\n\n318\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:27.150\nIt's not a rule.\n\n319\n00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.060\nIt's not a requirement.\n\n320\n00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.270\nIn fact, right here in my lab,\n\n321\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.880\nI don't use dot one because it's\nbeing used for something else.\n\n322\n00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.563\nSo I use 0.2.\n\n323\n00:15:33.563 --> 00:15:38.361\n>> To be honest with you I started\nusing .1 because everyone was using .1,\n\n324\n00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:41.426\nI was like well I wanna be\nlike all the cool kids.\n\n325\n00:15:41.426 --> 00:15:43.364\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna use .1 too.\n\n326\n00:15:43.364 --> 00:15:45.172\nNot .12, .1 also.\n\n327\n00:15:45.172 --> 00:15:47.036\n[LAUGH]\n>> Confusing.\n\n328\n00:15:47.036 --> 00:15:50.376\nAll right so on mine though, I need to use\n.2 so I'm gonna change my router here and\n\n329\n00:15:50.376 --> 00:15:52.599\nI'm gonna make it .2 cuz\nthat's where my router is.\n\n330\n00:15:52.599 --> 00:15:55.223\nSo, just be aware, you may need to\ncheck your network documentation and\n\n331\n00:15:55.223 --> 00:15:56.565\nfind out what that actual router is.\n\n332\n00:15:56.565 --> 00:15:58.475\nAll right so I'll go ahead and apply that.\n\n333\n00:15:58.475 --> 00:16:02.140\nAnd as soon as that's applied I should\nnow be able to talk to the internet.\n\n334\n00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.560\nSo if i repeat this ping that failed\na moment ago, now it succeeds.\n\n335\n00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.510\nNow I know the router to go to and the\nrouter gets me out the rest of the wan.\n\n336\n00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.810\nI'm able to get to wherever\nit is that I need.\n\n337\n00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.160\nSo, simple system.\n\n338\n00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.890\nWe need an IP address and a subnet mask.\n\n339\n00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.060\nThat identifies who we are.\n\n340\n00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.630\nAnd then we need a router\nto get everywhere else.\n\n341\n00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.890\nOkay.\n\n342\n00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.840\nThere is one other thing that\nis kind of important, though.\n\n343\n00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.340\nI'm done.\nI can talk on the network.\n\n344\n00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.370\nI can get out to the Internet.\n\n345\n00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.010\nI'm, I'm pinging out to this server.\n\n346\n00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:30.620\nNo problem.\n\n347\n00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.970\nEverything is working great, right?\n\n348\n00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.680\nBut I'm not really done.\n\n349\n00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.210\nIf I were to do something\nlike fire up Safari and\n\n350\n00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:44.450\ngo to www.google.com,\nSafari can't find the server.\n\n351\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:46.650\nWhy can't it find the server?\n\n352\n00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.690\nThe server's out there,\nit's Google they don't go down.\n\n353\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.570\nWell maybe they do,\nlet's try Apple instead right?\n\n354\n00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.740\nApple wouldn't go down,\nso I'm gonna go to Apple.\n\n355\n00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.160\nSafari can't find the server.\n\n356\n00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.310\nSo far, I can't find anything, all right?\n\n357\n00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:58.940\nWhy is that?\n\n358\n00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.770\nWell, IP addresses\naren't easy to remember.\n\n359\n00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.200\nPeople don't like them.\n\n360\n00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.115\nPeople don't like phone numbers.\n\n361\n00:17:04.115 --> 00:17:05.160\n>> 4.3 billion of them.\n\n362\n00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.380\n>> There are quite a few.\n\n363\n00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.520\nIt's not really practical to try and\nremember those.\n\n364\n00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:14.440\nSo instead, people give names, and\nthe names point to the IP addresses.\n\n365\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.880\nWell not the name specifically,\n\n366\n00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.940\nwe have what's called a DNS Server,\na domain naming system.\n\n367\n00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.630\nAnd the DNS Server,\nlets you map a name to an IP address.\n\n368\n00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:27.530\nSo now you don't have to remember an IP,\nyou can just remember a name, and\n\n369\n00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.850\nthat's far easier.\n\n370\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.100\nWhen I want to go to Apple's website,\nI type apple.com.\n\n371\n00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.430\nWhen I want to go to ITPro.TV's website,\nI type itpro.tv.\n\n372\n00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:39.040\nI type a name I don't type an address but\nwho's doing that translation?\n\n373\n00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.760\nWho's translating it from the name to the\naddress cuz the compter needs the address,\n\n374\n00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.950\nfor your computer we're talking\nneeds the IP address but\n\n375\n00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.700\nsomebody's gotta translate it\nnot somebody's a DNS server.\n\n376\n00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.820\nNow you may have your\nown DNS servers right?\n\n377\n00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.220\nIf you've got a Mac running the sever\napp It can do DNS, it's right there,\n\n378\n00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.000\nit's super easy,\nwe cover it in the server shows.\n\n379\n00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.130\nBut most of the time you're\ninternet service provider\n\n380\n00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.870\nwill give you DNS servers to use.\n\n381\n00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:07.240\nSo if you have Time Warner Cable or\nCox Cable,\n\n382\n00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.250\nyou have AT&T's U-verse DSL, or whatever.\n\n383\n00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.040\nWhoever your provider is\nwill give you DNS servers.\n\n384\n00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.890\nAnd there's plenty of other companies that\nare out there that have their own DNS\n\n385\n00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.740\nservers, like Google.\n\n386\n00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.520\nGoogle has DNS servers that\nyou're more than welcome to use,\n\n387\n00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.260\nthey're public,\neverybody can use them if you want.\n\n388\n00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.290\nBut if you have special domain needs, you\nmight need to set up your own DNS server.\n\n389\n00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.100\nSo in a corporate environment,\nit's very, very common for\n\n390\n00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.550\nyou to have your own DNS servers.\n\n391\n00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.450\nBut in a small business or\na home environment,\n\n392\n00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.140\nyou're probably just using\nwhatever your ISP gave you.\n\n393\n00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.590\nBut either way you've\ngotta have something.\n\n394\n00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:39.680\nAnd those DNS servers are what\nlets us resolve our names.\n\n395\n00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.920\nSo if I go back to the network utility,\nand\n\n396\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.470\nI kind of look at my settings under info\nhere, I can see I've got IP addresses.\n\n397\n00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.130\nI can see I've got those settings.\n\n398\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:52.430\nBut it doesn't really mention\nanything about naming.\n\n399\n00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.470\nWell actually it does,\nthere's this tab here called Lookup and\n\n400\n00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.440\nLookup is all about name lookups.\n\n401\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.270\nSo if I type apple.com in here and I do\na lookup for that, it's going to try and\n\n402\n00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:07.340\nlook it up against DNS servers and I get\nan error cuz I don't have DNS servers.\n\n403\n00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.110\nSo I need to get a DNS server.\n\n404\n00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:13.420\nSo, I'm going to go back to my network\nsettings and I can see it right here.\n\n405\n00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.860\nDNS server is blank, I can't fill it in.\n\n406\n00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.530\nWell, it's just on the advanced screen.\n\n407\n00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.210\nSo I need to hit the advanced button.\n\n408\n00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.470\nAnd under advanced,\nDNS has it's own fancy tab.\n\n409\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:27.070\nAnd right here I can set two things: DNS\nservers and search domains, alright.\n\n410\n00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.390\nEach of these are kind of important\nThe DNS service is the most important,\n\n411\n00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.440\nI need to have those, search domains\nyou can leave off if you want, but\n\n412\n00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.970\nI've gotta have DNS service.\n\n413\n00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:37.090\nAnd you can have as many as you want,\nright?\n\n414\n00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:38.740\nSo I know Google has two, all right.\n\n415\n00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:44.410\nSo Google has 8.8.8.8, and they have,\nlet's see, it's 8.8.4.4, all right.\n\n416\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.876\nSo those are two that Google has.\n\n417\n00:19:47.876 --> 00:19:50.970\nI know that Level Three has,\noddly enough three.\n\n418\n00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.568\nThey have 4.2.2.1.\n\n419\n00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:55.428\nThey have, oops.\n\n420\n00:19:55.428 --> 00:19:56.890\nCome on, there we go.\n\n421\n00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:03.125\n4.2.2.2 and, sorry guys my zoom\nis going a little nuts on me.\n\n422\n00:20:03.125 --> 00:20:05.691\nAnd, 2.2.2.3.\n\n423\n00:20:05.691 --> 00:20:06.980\nSo, I now have five DNS servers.\n\n424\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:07.810\nThat's pretty awesome.\n\n425\n00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.730\nI'm DNS-errific, right?\n\n426\n00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:10.490\nWell, I do.\n\n427\n00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.820\nI'm kinda wasting my time because what's\ngonna happen is I'm only gonna use\n\n428\n00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.940\nthe very first one.\n\n429\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.880\nI'll use that one.\n\n430\n00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.000\nAnd only if that one fails will\nI ever go to the next one.\n\n431\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.940\nAnd only if that one fails also, so\nboth of these have to fail before I go to\n\n432\n00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.160\nthe third one and all three of those have\nto fail before I go to the fourth one.\n\n433\n00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.510\nAnd all four of them have to fail\nbefore I go to the fifth one.\n\n434\n00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:35.570\nSo the odds of me ever getting to the\nfifth one are extremely low, extremely.\n\n435\n00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.960\nSo it's kinda silly to put\nmore than two in here.\n\n436\n00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.810\nSo you normally have a primary and\nif it fails a secondary.\n\n437\n00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.740\nSo most people do stop at two.\n\n438\n00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.340\nI might choose to say well,\nlet's choose Google as the primary and\n\n439\n00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.340\nLevel Three as the secondary,\ntwo different companies.\n\n440\n00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.480\nThat's nice,\nkind of hedge our bets, right?\n\n441\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.290\nIf one entire company goes down I've got\nthe other but I can specify those and\n\n442\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.920\nnow whenever I go to do a name lookup,\n\n443\n00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.460\nit will take the name and\nit will send it to one of these servers.\n\n444\n00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.310\nThe first one that's up.\n\n445\n00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.880\nAnd then that server will respond back\nwith the address that we need to use to\n\n446\n00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.610\nget to that server.\n\n447\n00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.480\nSo once I've got that in place,\nnow I can start to do those look ups.\n\n448\n00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.720\nAnd it's important,\n\n449\n00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.050\nit's important to understand that all\nof this is going on behind the scenes.\n\n450\n00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:24.350\nWe don't normally see this It's all\nkinda hidden from us behind the scenes.\n\n451\n00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.970\nAll right,\nnormally when we do a DNS lookup,\n\n452\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.420\nwe do a fully qualified domain name.\n\n453\n00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.720\nFully qualified domain name, FQDN.\n\n454\n00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.690\nAnd FQDNs normally look\nsomething www.apple.com, right.\n\n455\n00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.970\nThat's a fully qualified domain name.\n\n456\n00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:44.440\nBut if you've got a local network and\nall your machines share a domain name,\n\n457\n00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.350\nYou can use what are called\nsingle name look ups.\n\n458\n00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:51.110\nAnd a single name look up is where you\njust look for that first part of the name.\n\n459\n00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:57.150\nSo for example I've got OS X Client01,\nOS X Client02, OS X Server01,\n\n460\n00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:02.100\nOS X Server02, these are server names and\nworkstation names that I use in my lab.\n\n461\n00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:06.540\nBut they're all .lab.itpro.tv.\n\n462\n00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.975\nIf I just wanna do look up sa\nsingle name I don't wanna type\n\n463\n00:22:08.975 --> 00:22:12.040\nosx-server01.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n464\n00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.680\nI could come into this search domains and\n\n465\n00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.770\nI could add in lab.itpro.tv and\n\n466\n00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:25.310\nnow anytime I do a lookup for\nosx-server01 and\n\n467\n00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:31.400\njust leave it at that It'll automatically\nstick lab.itpro.tv on the end of it and\n\n468\n00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.040\nturn it into a fully qualified domain\nname which is what a DNA server requires.\n\n469\n00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.970\nSo this allows me to use like shortcuts\nand you could put all sort of things in\n\n470\n00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:44.020\nhere it just depends on what you need so\nme maybe I wanna put apple.com.\n\n471\n00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.161\nso now when I do a search if I have\nto do a single name it'll add-on,\n\n472\n00:22:48.161 --> 00:22:51.360\nit'll append apple.com\nto whatever I typed.\n\n473\n00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.130\nAnd if that fails,\nthen it'll try lab.itpro.tv.\n\n474\n00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.280\nSo it appends them, kinda in order,\n\n475\n00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.280\ntrying to figure out which\none is the one that works.\n\n476\n00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.090\nAll right, I've got this in place.\n\n477\n00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:02.680\nI'm gonna hit okay on that and Apply.\n\n478\n00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.770\nAnd I can see those DNS\nsettings right here.\n\n479\n00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:08.740\nLet's see if they're working, all right.\n\n480\n00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.150\nSo if I go back to my network utility.\n\n481\n00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:13.390\nI tried to look up apple.com earlier,\nand it failed.\n\n482\n00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:17.270\nLet me just do a lookup,\nand now it succeeds.\n\n483\n00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.965\nAnd I get not one, but\nthree different addresses for Apple.\n\n484\n00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:21.280\nCuz, well they know what they're doing.\n\n485\n00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.970\nIf one fails,\nwe want to have backups, right?\n\n486\n00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:24.450\nSo they've got backup servers.\n\n487\n00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.790\nAnd I can see all three of\nthose servers right there.\n\n488\n00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.700\nThose are the addresses for Apple,\nso I can get to their website.\n\n489\n00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.170\nOr I can get to Google or\nI can get wherever.\n\n490\n00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.070\nIf I go back to Safari,\nSafari's already reloaded, see,\n\n491\n00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.660\nI've got my iPhone SE\nadvertisements popping up here or\n\n492\n00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:43.110\nI try to go to Google and\nnow I can get to Google's page.\n\n493\n00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.300\nThat's working because it's\ndoing these name lookups.\n\n494\n00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:48.122\nHow do I know I was actually\ndoing the name lookup?\n\n495\n00:23:48.122 --> 00:23:51.970\nWell let's, I know I said I'm not going\nto get into the engineering details,\n\n496\n00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.555\nbut let me show you how this\nworks behind the scenes.\n\n497\n00:23:54.555 --> 00:23:58.700\nWhen I go to communicate to\nsomebody like Google or like Apple.\n\n498\n00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.210\nLet's just take Apple as the example,\nright.\n\n499\n00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:06.240\nSo I want to browse to apple.com,\nI want to browse to that website, okay.\n\n500\n00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.070\nWell several steps occur and\nit's all going on in the background.\n\n501\n00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.540\nThe first thing is a name look up happens,\nright.\n\n502\n00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:17.880\nSo if I jump into my terminal,\nthe very first thing is that Safari\n\n503\n00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.410\ndoes basically an NS look up,\na name server look up for apple.com.\n\n504\n00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.243\nRight?\nSince that's what I typed.\n\n505\n00:24:23.243 --> 00:24:25.088\nOr www.apple.com.\n\n506\n00:24:25.088 --> 00:24:28.080\nAnd they get addresses back.\n\n507\n00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.760\nAnd so here's the addresses they get back\nand they pull that name and they go.\n\n508\n00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.730\nNow I could have just done www,\nbecause remember I have\n\n509\n00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:40.790\nthe search domains listed, and\nApple.com was one of my search domains.\n\n510\n00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.080\nSo see when I search for\njust www it found the same thing, right?\n\n511\n00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.544\nAnd it's because of those search domains.\n\n512\n00:24:47.185 --> 00:24:50.740\nSo the name lookup happens first,\nthen I need to talk to it.\n\n513\n00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:55.900\nBut the problem is,\nit compares this IP to my IP.\n\n514\n00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:01.801\nI'm 192.168.0.152 and\nmy subnet mask is 255.255.255.\n\n515\n00:25:01.801 --> 00:25:04.274\nThat means that 192.168.0 is my network.\n\n516\n00:25:04.274 --> 00:25:07.653\nDoes this one start with 192.168.0?\n\n517\n00:25:07.653 --> 00:25:10.330\nNo, it's a different network.\n\n518\n00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:14.020\nSo, I know their IP, but\nI don't know how to get there.\n\n519\n00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.590\nSo the next thing I need to do\nis I need to talk to my router.\n\n520\n00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.513\nThe router's gonna help me.\n\n521\n00:25:17.513 --> 00:25:20.311\nWell, my router is 192.168.0.2.\n\n522\n00:25:20.311 --> 00:25:22.500\nDo I know how to get there?\n\n523\n00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.830\nMaybe.\nMaybe not.\n\n524\n00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:27.910\nI'll need to do an ARP\nbroadcast to find that router.\n\n525\n00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.170\nAnd we got to find the router first.\n\n526\n00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:34.310\nAnd so if I do an arp -a,\nI expect to see 192.168.0.2 right there.\n\n527\n00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.340\nAnd I do, right?\n\n528\n00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.690\nWe found our router.\n\n529\n00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.270\nNow I can talk to the router.\n\n530\n00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.740\nAnd I can send a message\nto the router saying, hey,\n\n531\n00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.220\nI'm trying to get to Apple and\nI don't know how to get there.\n\n532\n00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:47.570\nAnd the router will figure out\nthe rest of the way to get to Apple.\n\n533\n00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.300\nWhen you talk to a server,\nyou'll pass through a number of different\n\n534\n00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.830\nrouters that are all behind the scenes,\nright?\n\n535\n00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:56.470\nAnd so,\nif I go back to my Network Utility.\n\n536\n00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:57.930\nWhere is my Network Utility?\n\n537\n00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:01.570\nThere, there's a neat utility\ncalled Traceroute that we can use.\n\n538\n00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:06.220\nAnd you can punch in something\nlike apple.com and do a trace.\n\n539\n00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:11.820\nAnd it will show all the routers you\npassed through on your way to Apple.\n\n540\n00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.662\nAnd so I hit my router, 192.160.0.2.\n\n541\n00:26:14.662 --> 00:26:16.484\nAnd then, shoot.\n\n542\n00:26:16.484 --> 00:26:18.424\nI'm in a virtual machine.\n\n543\n00:26:18.424 --> 00:26:21.320\nAnd the virtual machine has a little\nfirewall that's stopping that.\n\n544\n00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.150\nLet me switch to my real machine and\nI'll show you here.\n\n545\n00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.987\nSo on my Network Utility if\nI do a quick traceroute, and\n\n546\n00:26:26.987 --> 00:26:33.560\nI'll trace route to apple.com and\nI'll trace it out there we go.\n\n547\n00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.400\nSo you can see I'm passing through our\nISP Gainsville regional utilities, so\n\n548\n00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.520\nI'm passing through gru.\n\n549\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.220\nAnd from gru,\nthey're hopping me out to some\n\n550\n00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.480\nother servers on the internet before\njumping me over to wherever Apple is and\n\n551\n00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.370\nthen, now it looks like I'm\nhitting one of Apple's firewalls.\n\n552\n00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.270\nSome people block these types of\ncommunications on the firewall, but\n\n553\n00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.040\neach of these hops, so I see nine things.\n\n554\n00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.450\nThose nine things are all routers.\n\n555\n00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.120\nDifferent routers I had to pass\nthrough to get to the destination.\n\n556\n00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.670\nI didn't know where to go.\n\n557\n00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:01.750\nThey figured it out for me.\n\n558\n00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.680\nThat's what routers do, that's their job.\n\n559\n00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.710\nAnd so they're completing that to make\nsure that I get over to that destination.\n\n560\n00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.000\nSo that's all happening in the background.\n\n561\n00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.380\nAnd then once we are connected,\nnow we are talking to that server.\n\n562\n00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.170\nRight now I am talking to Apple.\n\n563\n00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.130\nAnd so I've got a live connection.\n\n564\n00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.230\nAnd if I dive into the background here.\n\n565\n00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.529\nLet's do a netstat.\n\n566\n00:27:20.529 --> 00:27:22.443\nNetstat's a neat little utility,\n\n567\n00:27:22.443 --> 00:27:26.750\nbecause it can show you everything\nthat is going on behind the scenes.\n\n568\n00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:32.351\nWell, if I do a netstat and\nI look for 96.17.34.103,\n\n569\n00:27:32.351 --> 00:27:36.154\nthat was the IP address\nthat I got from Apple.\n\n570\n00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:37.478\nI get nothing.\n\n571\n00:27:37.478 --> 00:27:40.009\nWhat the heck's that all about?\n\n572\n00:27:40.009 --> 00:27:40.671\nI should've seen something, right?\n\n573\n00:27:40.671 --> 00:27:42.490\nThat's the IP I connected to.\n\n574\n00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.180\nUnfortunately, it's not\nnecessarily the IP I connected to.\n\n575\n00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.654\nSee how this says akamaiedge.net?\n\n576\n00:27:48.685 --> 00:27:51.530\nAkamai is a company that specializes\nin content distribution.\n\n577\n00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.690\nThey have servers all over the world.\n\n578\n00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:57.450\nSo when you go to connect to Apple,\nthey may redirect you to a server nearby.\n\n579\n00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:01.640\nSo I know this is the IP for Apple, but\nthey may have sent me somewhere else and\n\n580\n00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.070\nI'll don't see that connection.\n\n581\n00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.620\nLet me pick somebody I\ncan test a little better.\n\n582\n00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.640\nSo IT PRO TV, right?\n\n583\n00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:14.441\nIf I do an nslookup for itpro.tv,\nthere's only one address, 192.124.249.6.\n\n584\n00:28:14.441 --> 00:28:16.124\nNow, that looks like a private IP,\ndoesn't it?\n\n585\n00:28:16.124 --> 00:28:17.340\n>> It does.\n\n586\n00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.760\n>> Starts with 192, but\nit's not a private IP.\n\n587\n00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.567\nRemember, private IPs start with 192.168.\n\n588\n00:28:23.567 --> 00:28:26.620\nThis is 192.124, that's a valid,\npublic IP, right?\n\n589\n00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.500\nIt's just an example of how\nthose boundaries are defined.\n\n590\n00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.240\nBut that's the IP.\n\n591\n00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.585\nSo if I go out, and I browse to itpro.tv,\n\n592\n00:28:35.585 --> 00:28:39.320\nI'm going to that one IP address.\n\n593\n00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.430\nAnd the routers are helping me get there.\n\n594\n00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:48.300\nAnd if I go back to my command prompt,\nand I do a netstat -an.\n\n595\n00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.826\nAnd I look for 192.124.249.6.\n\n596\n00:28:52.826 --> 00:28:55.126\nAll right, and I look for that.\n\n597\n00:28:55.126 --> 00:28:57.053\nLook at all these connections I've got.\n\n598\n00:28:57.053 --> 00:28:59.711\nAll right, I've got,\nwhat is that, seven connections?\n\n599\n00:28:59.711 --> 00:29:02.370\nSeven connections that\nare all using port 443.\n\n600\n00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:04.216\nThey're SSL, secure socket layer, right?\n\n601\n00:29:04.216 --> 00:29:06.538\nSo I'm establishing an encrypted\nconnection to ITProTV.\n\n602\n00:29:06.538 --> 00:29:10.260\nIn fact if I look back here, you can see\non the title bar we've got the green lock.\n\n603\n00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.000\nSo it is using SSL, we've got\nan encrypted connection to that website.\n\n604\n00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.290\nAll right, now why seven connections?\n\n605\n00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.670\nWell, one connection was to\nget a copy of the web page.\n\n606\n00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:25.030\nIn the web page there's pictures, videos,\nthere's images, things like that.\n\n607\n00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.270\nEach of those are a separate connection.\n\n608\n00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.960\nWe connect to download the images and\nso they all show up.\n\n609\n00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.170\nBut over time they'll age out.\n\n610\n00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.620\nThose connections come and go.\n\n611\n00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.480\nSo if you're ever bored and you just sit\nhere and keep running netstat over and\n\n612\n00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.490\nover and over again.\n\n613\n00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:39.348\nYou'll see these things increase and\nthen decrease as you sit there in idle.\n\n614\n00:29:39.348 --> 00:29:40.900\nNow that video's gonna play over and\nover so\n\n615\n00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.640\nI don't know how long\nit'll take that to idle.\n\n616\n00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.460\nBut the images and stuff,\nthose'll idle out.\n\n617\n00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.480\nAnd usually in the next\ntwo to three minutes,\n\n618\n00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.210\nyou'll start to see these drop away.\n\n619\n00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.630\nAnd if I close the web page, well then\nthey drop away even faster, right?\n\n620\n00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:55.690\nSo if I get out of Safari,\nI'm not looking at that page anymore.\n\n621\n00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.690\nAnd now I'm down to one connection.\n\n622\n00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:00.430\nWhy do I still have one connection?\n\n623\n00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:03.740\nWell If I fire up my browser,\nand I go back to ITProTV,\n\n624\n00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:07.590\nit can save some time because\nit still has a connection open.\n\n625\n00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:10.380\nIt's still holding one little\nfoot in the door, right?\n\n626\n00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.040\nBut even that'll age out in\nfive minutes and go away.\n\n627\n00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.750\nBut if I go back in the next few minutes,\nI'm already there.\n\n628\n00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.385\nI've already got a connection and\nI'm in business.\n\n629\n00:30:17.385 --> 00:30:19.320\nBut, those will trickle away.\n\n630\n00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.980\nAnd eventually, I'll have none listed.\n\n631\n00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.520\nBut that's where all\nthose connections are.\n\n632\n00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.855\nAll that's happening in the background and\nit's all thanks to IP addresses.\n\n633\n00:30:26.855 --> 00:30:31.050\nAnd I'm able to find that server,\nget connected to it and view that content.\n\n634\n00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:35.690\n>> Now Don, how often is it the problem,\na lot of times people call up,\n\n635\n00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:37.110\nyou're a support professional,\n\n636\n00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:41.580\nyou're gonna have users that say I'm\nhaving trouble getting to our website.\n\n637\n00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.410\nI'm having trouble getting\nto our internet site.\n\n638\n00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:46.420\nHow often is it something like\nDNS that's causing the issue?\n\n639\n00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.600\n>> It can be pretty common,\n\n640\n00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.460\nexcept the thing with DNS is if you've got\nit wrong, usually everything's broken.\n\n641\n00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.460\nIt's not like some things work and\nsome things don't.\n\n642\n00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.710\nIf you got it wrong, everything's broken,\nso it's usually easy to spot.\n\n643\n00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:59.970\nDNS servers you don't change them very\noften, you normally set it and forget it.\n\n644\n00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.776\nSo sometimes your DNS servers change and\nthen you gotta remember to go and\n\n645\n00:31:02.776 --> 00:31:03.940\nupdate your clients.\n\n646\n00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.610\nIf you're using DHCP,\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n647\n00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:09.770\n>> So would just say probably DHCP\nwould be our bigger culprit than\n\n648\n00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:12.030\njust not getting\nthe information to our clients.\n\n649\n00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:12.820\n>> Yeah, usually.\n\n650\n00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.960\nYeah usually something on the server,\nsomething can go wrong.\n\n651\n00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.190\nYou know those attacks that people\nperform against the DNS servers?\n\n652\n00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:19.110\nThose can all cause\nthings to get derailed.\n\n653\n00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.760\n>> All right, well Don we've covered a lot\nof ground again here in this episode.\n\n654\n00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.700\nBut I'm looking at the clock.\n\n655\n00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.400\nIt's starting to dwindle down, and\n\n656\n00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.620\nwe haven't even, we're basically\njust talking about configuration.\n\n657\n00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.300\nWe haven't even got into\nthings like WiFi and all that.\n\n658\n00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.900\nA lot of other great topics left to go.\n\n659\n00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.190\nAnything that you'd like to add to\nthis episode before we close it down?\n\n660\n00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.200\n>> One last thing worth mentioning is,\nI showed you guys IPv4 addresses.\n\n661\n00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.450\nCuz that's what you're\ngonna use in real life, and\n\n662\n00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:41.470\nthat's what's gonna be on the exam.\n\n663\n00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.610\nBut let me just show you\nreal quick IPv6 addresses.\n\n664\n00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:49.650\nSo, when I went into the settings here,\nit's got of this IPv4 stuff to setup.\n\n665\n00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.820\nIPv6 doesn't even show up does it?\n\n666\n00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.460\nBut if I go into advanced, inside of the\nadvanced screens, we get our TCP options.\n\n667\n00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.410\nIt's got configure IPv4.\n\n668\n00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:01.920\nAnd you can see right\ndown here on the bottom,\n\n669\n00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.680\nconfigure IPv6 automatically,\nrouter IPv6 address and prefix length.\n\n670\n00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.420\nIPv6 is turned on by default but it's\nnot in use, it doesn't have an address.\n\n671\n00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:11.880\nIt's trying to get one on the network but\n\n672\n00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.720\nthere's no one on our network that's\nrunning it, so it doesn't get an address.\n\n673\n00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.928\nIf you want to manually assign IPv6\naddresses, you just change that to\n\n674\n00:32:17.928 --> 00:32:21.142\nmanually and then you can come in here and\nyou can specify that address.\n\n675\n00:32:21.142 --> 00:32:24.550\nAnd in IPv6 you have,\nI clicked in the wrong spot.\n\n676\n00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.050\nYou have a router, just like in IPv4.\n\n677\n00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:27.590\nYou have an address, and\n\n678\n00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.390\nyou have a prefix link,\nwhich is the equivalent of a subnet mask.\n\n679\n00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:32.090\nSo you can plug that data right in there.\n\n680\n00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:34.010\nSo IPv6 is done right along IPv4.\n\n681\n00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:36.540\nIt's just in the advanced screen, right?\n\n682\n00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.790\nSo you get to this screen here,\nyou got to go into advanced.\n\n683\n00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.540\nAnd that's where IPV6 is tucked away.\n\n684\n00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:41.180\n>> Awesome.\nWell,\n\n685\n00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.426\nwe know this was going to be\na multi-part series here.\n\n686\n00:32:44.426 --> 00:32:47.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Networking is not a small topic.\n\n687\n00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:51.340\nSo it's gonna take us at least one\nmore episode to get through all\n\n688\n00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:55.420\nthe myriad of different elements that\nthey want you to know for their exam.\n\n689\n00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.700\nAnd the good thing is it's gonna help you\nout in your day to day life as you support\n\n690\n00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.750\ncomputers on a network system.\n\n691\n00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.670\nSo, Don, thanks for dropping by.\n\n692\n00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:06.150\nThanks for explaining how the heck\nwe actually get this information\n\n693\n00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:07.950\ninto our client's systems.\n\n694\n00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:08.830\nAnd I look forward to seeing what\n\n695\n00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:11.360\nelse you got up your sleeve\nin the upcoming episode.\n\n696\n00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.520\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n697\n00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.580\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n698\n00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.280\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n699\n00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.010\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n700\n00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:17.566\n>>

00:00:17.325\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:18.088\nI'm your host,\n\n5\n00:00:18.088 --> 00:00:22.121\nDon Pezet, back again with another episode\nof Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n6\n00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:24.930\nAnd as you might have noticed\nI'm kind of all by myself today.\n\n7\n00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.290\nDaniel had to get pulled aside for\n\n8\n00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.280\nanother show but that's okay cuz today\nwe're taking a look at networking.\n\n9\n00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.460\nAnd networking is all about getting\ncomputers to talk together so\n\n10\n00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.510\nyou're never by yourself, right?\n\n11\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.150\nThere's always somebody else out\nthere on the network you can talk to.\n\n12\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.020\nWell unless things are broken, in which\ncase we have to figure that out too.\n\n13\n00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.150\nSo in this episode though we're gonna\nfocus back on network configuration.\n\n14\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.180\nAnd I know this is part three,\nwe've already spent some time doing this.\n\n15\n00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.520\nIn part one we learned about IP addresses,\nIPv4 and IPv6.\n\n16\n00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.710\nWe talked about how network\ncommunications worked.\n\n17\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.240\nAnd in part two we got a set up, right?\n\n18\n00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.330\nWe configured IP addresses and\nour router and DNS and\n\n19\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.020\nwe got that configured on a system.\n\n20\n00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.240\nBut the whole time,\nI was working with a wired connection.\n\n21\n00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.920\nIt was my Thunderbolt connection here.\n\n22\n00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.040\nAnd in this episode, I kind of wanna\nchange gears a little bit, and\n\n23\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.860\nlook at that same process,\nbut for a wireless adapter.\n\n24\n00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.550\nWireless adapters are different, right?\n\n25\n00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.770\nThey're different than Ethernet,\nbecause with Ethernet, you just plug,\n\n26\n00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.310\nyou know I should say Ethernet, right?\n\n27\n00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.330\nBecause wireless uses Ethernet too,\nit's just using it differently.\n\n28\n00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.860\nSo a wired connection,\njust a regular copper based Ethernet jack.\n\n29\n00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.820\nWhen you plug that thing in the link\ngoes hot and you're ready to talk.\n\n30\n00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.340\nOn wireless though, it's not like that.\n\n31\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.600\nOn wireless you've got an antennae and\nthat antennae is looking at radio\n\n32\n00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.350\nfrequency waves that are floating\nabout there in the air and\n\n33\n00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.070\nwe have to tell it which\nnetwork to connect to.\n\n34\n00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.090\nAnd when we tell it to connect, there may\nbe encryption and authentication enabled.\n\n35\n00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.070\nExtra steps we have to go\nthrough to get connected.\n\n36\n00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.650\nWe don't normally see that on the copper\nbased, the physical Ethernet connections.\n\n37\n00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.720\nYou don't normally see it.\n\n38\n00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.450\nYou can, right,\nlet me show you an example.\n\n39\n00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.750\nSo if I take this work station,\nso this is a virtual machine,\n\n40\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.730\nand the virtual machine only\nhas a physical adapter in it.\n\n41\n00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.840\nIt doesn't have wireless at all.\n\n42\n00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.660\nSo when I go into its\nsystem preferences and\n\n43\n00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.800\nI go into Networking, I'm gonna see\na physical Ethernet connection.\n\n44\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.920\nSo right there, Ethernet connected.\n\n45\n00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.790\nAnd when we go into its settings,\nwell that's where you can come in here and\n\n46\n00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.260\nsay, I'll do this manually.\n\n47\n00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.130\nI'll specify IP addresses and so on.\n\n48\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.740\nThat's what we expect to\nsee on a normal connection.\n\n49\n00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.203\nIt may be that you've got a DSL modem and\n\n50\n00:02:25.203 --> 00:02:30.370\nyou're plugging this Ethernet jack\ndirectly into your DSL modem.\n\n51\n00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.860\nNow I'll be honest with you guys,\nvery, very few people do that.\n\n52\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.530\nYou almost always have\na router these days, and\n\n53\n00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.550\nthe router's what the DSL\nmodem plugs into.\n\n54\n00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.170\nBut if you plug your computer directly\ninto it, most DSL connections\n\n55\n00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.750\nrequire you to authenticate,\nto have a username and password.\n\n56\n00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.610\nAnd physical jacks don't normally ask for\nthat.\n\n57\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.880\nWireless does, not wired.\n\n58\n00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.700\nWell, on the wired side there\nare actually two exceptions to that rule.\n\n59\n00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.920\nAnd one is PPPoE, or\npoint to point protocol over Ethernet.\n\n60\n00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.280\nAnd DSL uses this a lot.\n\n61\n00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.926\nSo if you plug into DSL\nmodem you'll likely have\n\n62\n00:03:02.926 --> 00:03:04.580\nto pass that username and password.\n\n63\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.320\nIt doesn't give me that option here.\n\n64\n00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.880\nWell under configure IPv4,\nwhen I drop that down,\n\n65\n00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.120\nyou'll see Create a PPPoE Service.\n\n66\n00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.810\nI can create a virtual adapter\nthat's tied to this real adapter\n\n67\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.850\nthat can provide a username and\na password.\n\n68\n00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.980\nSo that's one way that I can do\nauthentication on a physical connection.\n\n69\n00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.540\nIf I go into Advanced,\nI'll see the other way.\n\n70\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.758\nOops, let me put back DHCP.\n\n71\n00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:31.360\nAll righty, it got happy with it.\n\n72\n00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.430\nBack here in my physical settings.\n\n73\n00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.720\nIf you look at the options up top,\nwhen we talked TCP/IP,\n\n74\n00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.490\nwe talked about DNS,\nwe didn't talk about WINS, right?\n\n75\n00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.740\nThat's the old Windows naming solution,\nand Microsoft doesn't even use it anymore,\n\n76\n00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.610\nso we rarely use that one.\n\n77\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.910\nAnd then, there's 802.1X, okay.\n\n78\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.680\nWhat is 802.1X?\n\n79\n00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.378\nWell it's a standard that's designed\nto provide authentication on\n\n80\n00:03:55.378 --> 00:03:57.165\na physical network jack.\n\n81\n00:03:57.165 --> 00:04:01.990\nAnd 802.1X is part of what provides\nauthentication on wireless networks also.\n\n82\n00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.940\nA lot of people think that it was created\nfor wireless and it's true, it is used for\n\n83\n00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.450\nwireless a lot.\n\n84\n00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.070\nBut it was actually created for\nwired networks first and\n\n85\n00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.550\nthen it was moved over\nto the wireless world.\n\n86\n00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.760\nSo when you plug into that physical jack,\nyou don't necessarily just get allowed to\n\n87\n00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.720\ntalk and you're on the network and\nthat's it.\n\n88\n00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.930\nBecause what if you,\nlet's say you work for a hospital.\n\n89\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.430\nYou've got a massive building, right,\n\n90\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.660\nthousands of rooms spread\nout through this building.\n\n91\n00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.710\nAnd every room has at least\none network jack in it for\n\n92\n00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.670\nall the computer equipment\nthe hospitals use.\n\n93\n00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.130\nWell whats to stop a hacker from checking\ninto the hospital, getting into a room,\n\n94\n00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.480\nunplugging the medical equipment, and\njust plugging in their laptop in?\n\n95\n00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.510\nAnd now they're on your network.\n\n96\n00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.680\nThat's a very real risk, and\nyou can't monitor for that physically.\n\n97\n00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.670\nYou can't be watching every single room.\n\n98\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.560\nEspecially with sensitive patient data.\n\n99\n00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.940\nIt's not gonna happen.\n\n100\n00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.133\nSo it's very hard to look after that.\n\n101\n00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:55.197\nSo 802.1x looks to solve that.\n\n102\n00:04:55.197 --> 00:05:00.710\nWhat 802.1x has is if you plug in to this\njack, you've gotta show me a certificate.\n\n103\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.980\nYou've gotta show me some kind of\nauthentication that proves you are who you\n\n104\n00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.140\nsay you are.\n\n105\n00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.800\nAnd then I'll determine whether\nyou're allowed on the network.\n\n106\n00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.560\nAnd if you're allowed, yeah, you can talk.\n\n107\n00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.520\nIt works great.\n\n108\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.600\nBut if you're not allowed?\n\n109\n00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.379\nThe port just sets they're dead and\nyour all traffic gets dropped.\n\n110\n00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.703\nThat's 802.1x and we've got support for\nthat right here in Mac OS.\n\n111\n00:05:18.703 --> 00:05:19.555\nSo, PPPoE and\n\n112\n00:05:19.555 --> 00:05:25.400\n802.1x are two ways that we can provide\nauthentication on physical network jack.\n\n113\n00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.458\nThe other tabs in here\nare things like proxies.\n\n114\n00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:32.740\nProxies are where I'm not allowed to\ngo out to the Internet for example.\n\n115\n00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.960\nBut I'm allowed to talk\nto a proxy server and\n\n116\n00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.630\nthe proxy server can go out\nto the Internet on my behalf.\n\n117\n00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.370\nIt can reach out there for me.\n\n118\n00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.380\nThis is neat because all\nthe computers in your\n\n119\n00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.350\norganization don't need Internet access.\n\n120\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.250\nOnly one computer needs Internet access\nthe you have full control of it,\n\n121\n00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.340\nthat proxy.\n\n122\n00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.230\nYou can dictate what websites\nare allowed to go to the what\n\n123\n00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.620\nwebsites you not allowed to go to.\n\n124\n00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.990\nYou can really control that stuff.\n\n125\n00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.120\nAnd you can require usernames and\n\n126\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.710\npasswords to be able to\nget out on the Internet.\n\n127\n00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.990\nNow technically you're already\ntalking on the network.\n\n128\n00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.320\nIt would just be a username and\npassword for passing through the proxy.\n\n129\n00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.510\nSo it's not the same level of\nsecurity as 802.1x and PPPoE.\n\n130\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.680\nAnd our last tab here is hardware.\n\n131\n00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.150\nThere's not much that\nwill ever configure here.\n\n132\n00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.320\nThis is where you can hard set your\nspeeds and your duplex and your MTUs.\n\n133\n00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.480\nSpeed, that's just how fast you talk.\n\n134\n00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.060\nAnd most Macs these days have\na gigabit adapter in them so\n\n135\n00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.220\nyou'll see 1000baseT so we're gonna\ncommunicate at 1000 megabits per second.\n\n136\n00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.250\nYou might have a 100 megabit connection or\na 10 megabit connection so\n\n137\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.440\nyou'll see each of those\nare listed in here.\n\n138\n00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.810\nAuto is the default, which means it'll\njust figure out what your connection is.\n\n139\n00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.840\nNow if you're a 10 or 100, you can be\nin full duplex or half duplex mode.\n\n140\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.180\nFull duplex means you can send and\nreceive data at the same time.\n\n141\n00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.120\nHalf duplex means you can only send or\nreceive, you can only do one at a time.\n\n142\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.870\nSo if I have a 100 megabit connection, and\n\n143\n00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.980\nI'm a half duplex,\nI can only move 100 megs of data.\n\n144\n00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.150\nBut if I'm in a 100 megabit and\nI'm full duplex,\n\n145\n00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.200\nI could be sending 100 megabits of data\nwhile i'm receiving 100 megabits of data.\n\n146\n00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.250\nIt's actually 200 megabits of data so you\ncan get a lot more bandwidth out of that.\n\n147\n00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.520\nWhen you're on a gigabit connection,\ngigabit only does full duplex so\n\n148\n00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.820\nI lose that option to choose half duplex.\n\n149\n00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.160\nIf I leave it on auto, it will\nautomatically figure out what's supported.\n\n150\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.560\nAnd then MTU is the maximum\ntransmission unit.\n\n151\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.545\nWhen you send data on the network,\nif it's under 1,500 bytes, or I'm sorry,\n\n152\n00:07:26.545 --> 00:07:31.256\n1,500 k, if it's under 1,500 k,\nno actually I was right, 1,500 bytes.\n\n153\n00:07:31.256 --> 00:07:32.960\n[LAUGH] I had straight in my head.\n\n154\n00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.840\nIf it's under 1,500 bytes, it'll send it\nin one packet, one segment on the network.\n\n155\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.990\nIf it's bigger than that,\n\n156\n00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.760\nit breaks it up into multiple packets to\nsend it in pieces across the network.\n\n157\n00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.410\nAnd so this is the size.\n\n158\n00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.110\nMost systems, Linux, Windows,\n\n159\n00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.360\nMac, they pretty much all default\nto 1500 bytes these days.\n\n160\n00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.260\nYou can tweak that.\n\n161\n00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.488\nYou can come in and change it and set it\nto other values, but the default is 1500.\n\n162\n00:07:56.488 --> 00:07:58.737\nAll right now,\nI know what you're thinking.\n\n163\n00:07:58.737 --> 00:08:01.443\nI said we are going to talk about\nwireless and this is all wired stuff.\n\n164\n00:08:01.443 --> 00:08:02.511\nSo, why am I talking about it here?\n\n165\n00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:06.071\nWell it actually comes into play,\nin the wireless world too but\n\n166\n00:08:06.071 --> 00:08:08.680\nit's a little bit different, right?\n\n167\n00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.350\nSo let's talk about Duplex.\n\n168\n00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:15.890\nWith Duplex if I'm full Duplex I can\nsend and receive data at the same time.\n\n169\n00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.250\nI can have data going in both directions.\n\n170\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.060\nSimultaneously.\n\n171\n00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.560\nWell in the wireless world,\nwe have antennas.\n\n172\n00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.100\nYou have antennas built into your laptop,\n\n173\n00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.780\nyou have antennas built into\nyour airport or access point or\n\n174\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.170\nwhatever it is that you're using,\nto communicate on your wireless network.\n\n175\n00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.970\nAnd a wireless antenna.\n\n176\n00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.560\nCan only send or receive.\n\n177\n00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.430\nWireless antenna's are half Duplex.\n\n178\n00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.690\nSo just like in the wired\nworld where we have Duplex,\n\n179\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.870\nyou have it in the wireless world also.\n\n180\n00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.960\nNow we get around that\na few different ways.\n\n181\n00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.300\nif you were to rip open, like if you\nwere to take my MacBook here and\n\n182\n00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.480\nrip open the monitor.\n\n183\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.510\nThere's actually two antennas.\n\n184\n00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.870\nThere'll be a black and white cable\nrunning up each side of the monitor.\n\n185\n00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.530\nThat's on a laptop that's\nwhere they nest this.\n\n186\n00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.430\nLike if we kinda take\na look at my laptop here.\n\n187\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.930\nSo there'll be one antenna that runs\nup this side of the screen, and\n\n188\n00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.640\nmore than likely wraps around the top.\n\n189\n00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.210\nI don't know on this one if it does or\nnot.\n\n190\n00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.690\nAnd then there will be another one runs\nup the other side like that, and so\n\n191\n00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.130\nthe antennas is actually build\ninto the lead of your laptop\n\n192\n00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:16.100\nwhich pretty cool cuz you normally have\nthat laid out in the open on the table,\n\n193\n00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.040\nthe monitor is pointing straight\nup it a great place for antennas.\n\n194\n00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.570\nOn a desktop, not so\nconvenient anymore, right?\n\n195\n00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.180\nSo if I have a Mac mini.\n\n196\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.480\nThe wireless antennas are in the Mac mini\ntoo and they wrap around the edges, but\n\n197\n00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.800\na Mac mini is flat and a lot of people\nstick it in a drawer or in a shelf and\n\n198\n00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.370\nnow you got all of this interference\nwith the wireless signal.\n\n199\n00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.000\nWe have to worry about that.\n\n200\n00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.090\nBut the key thing is that you've two\nantennas, and the two antennas are so\n\n201\n00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.730\nthat you can send and\nreceive at the same time.\n\n202\n00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.240\nSo that you get full Duplex, you just\nhave to have two antennas to do it.\n\n203\n00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.640\nNow we don't see that in the software.\n\n204\n00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.510\nIn the software we just\nsee one wireless card, and\n\n205\n00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.950\nwe don't necessarily know\nabout the multiple antennas.\n\n206\n00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.790\nBut on your access point.\n\n207\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.090\nThink about the last wireless\naccess point you saw.\n\n208\n00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.240\nMaybe not in airport cuz\nthey're internal antennas.\n\n209\n00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.220\nBut if you look at third party ones,\ngo to the local computer store.\n\n210\n00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.690\nBest Buy or whatever, and\n\n211\n00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.030\nyou'll see most of the wireless\nrouters have two antennas, right?\n\n212\n00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.080\nTwo antennas sticking out of it.\n\n213\n00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.110\nIt's the same idea, send in or receive.\n\n214\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.080\nNow If you get the really expensive ones\nthese days they might have six antennas or\n\n215\n00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.750\neight they look like spaceships, right?\n\n216\n00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.720\nAnd the reason they're doing that is\nhow many people are on your network,\n\n217\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.040\nis it just you?\n\n218\n00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.250\nIf it's just you, you can send and\nreceive all day and that's it.\n\n219\n00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.720\nBut what if you have five people\nsharing the same wireless network?\n\n220\n00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.960\nWell, we can only send or\nreceive on a single antenna.\n\n221\n00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.920\nAnd an antenna can only be\ndoing one thing at a time.\n\n222\n00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.880\nIt can only talk to one person at a time.\n\n223\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.830\nSo the more people we have.\n\n224\n00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.510\nThe weaker that signal gets,\nthe less traffic that we can move.\n\n225\n00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.880\nAnd so it's not as efficient.\n\n226\n00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.340\nAnd the solution is\njust add more antennas.\n\n227\n00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.500\nThe most antennas the better.\n\n228\n00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.180\nSo the next time you're at the store and\nyou see that access point and\n\n229\n00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.450\nyou're like, it looks like a spaceship.\n\n230\n00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.410\nIt's got eight antennas on it.\n\n231\n00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.100\nKnow that that's a really\ngood access point.\n\n232\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.750\nBecause it can handle a lot of traffic,\nand a lot more people connected to it.\n\n233\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.340\nWhen you buy like an Apple AirPort, the\nAirPorts, all the antennas are internal so\n\n234\n00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.700\nyou really can't see it.\n\n235\n00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.670\nBut they have four or six antennas\ndepending on which one you get.\n\n236\n00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.310\nAnd so they've actually got\nmultiple antennas in them trying\n\n237\n00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.300\nto provide us same basic functionality.\n\n238\n00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.196\nBut you might need external antennas\nto really get the range that you want.\n\n239\n00:11:12.196 --> 00:11:14.590\nAll right so, we're not gonna see\nit here on this virtual machine but\n\n240\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.260\nlet me flip over to my actual desktop.\n\n241\n00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.940\nAnd we'll get a chance to see\na wireless configuration.\n\n242\n00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.700\nSo here on my laptop I've got both\na wired and a wireless configuration.\n\n243\n00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.040\nIf I go into my System Preferences.\n\n244\n00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.640\nAnd I go into Network.\n\n245\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.940\nI'm gonna see that I'm connected\nto two different networks.\n\n246\n00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.670\nThe first one is my\nThunderbolt Ethernet connection, right.\n\n247\n00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.640\nSo, I've gotta Thunderbolt Ethernet\nadapter right here's the official\n\n248\n00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.550\nApple One.\n\n249\n00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.470\nAnd that's when I'm\nplugging to using the show.\n\n250\n00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.360\nWe talked about it in the last episode.\n\n251\n00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.770\nBut then I've got Wi-Fi right beneath it.\n\n252\n00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.540\nAnd they've got two different icons\nto represent what they are right?\n\n253\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.670\nThe little greater than and\nless than with the dots, that's for\n\n254\n00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.360\nthe physical connector and\nthe wireless waves, that's for wireless.\n\n255\n00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.548\nAnd the blue lines here for\n\n256\n00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.420\nthe wireless signal actually\nreflect how strong my signal is.\n\n257\n00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.820\nI've got five bars.\n\n258\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.830\nThe access point is let's\nsee it's two walls away but\n\n259\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.400\nit's maybe a whopping 15 feet\nfrom where I'm standing.\n\n260\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.420\nSo, that's why I've got a good strong\nsignal and I see it right here.\n\n261\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.670\nNow the order of this list is important.\n\n262\n00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.490\nSee how the Thunderbolt Ethernet\nadapter is on top?\n\n263\n00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.380\nAnd the Wi-Fi adapter is second.\n\n264\n00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.190\nThat means that my system is going to\nprefer the Thunderbolt adapter over Wi-Fi.\n\n265\n00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:24.210\nAnd that's normally what I want, I want it\nto prefer the Thunderbolt adapter because\n\n266\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.410\nit's a wired connection\nthat I can count on.\n\n267\n00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.150\nThat I can always send and\nreceive data, and\n\n268\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.720\nI'm not gonna have to worry\nabout bumping into anybody out.\n\n269\n00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.230\nOr about antennas.\n\n270\n00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.200\nI've got a good strong signal.\n\n271\n00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:37.820\nBut on wireless, it could be that your\nwireless connection is better, right?\n\n272\n00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:38.970\nIn fact, I think mine might be.\n\n273\n00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:39.770\nLet's see.\n\n274\n00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.390\nSo if I look at my\nThunderbolt Ethernet adapter, right,\n\n275\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.220\nI can see some basic information\nabout it right here.\n\n276\n00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.030\nAnd if I fire up my network utility.\n\n277\n00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.120\nWhen I look at my Network Utility, and\n\n278\n00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.170\nI go to the info tab, it's gonna\ntell me about my connection, and\n\n279\n00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.610\nlet me shrink this down a bit here so\nI can get it all on the screen at once.\n\n280\n00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.330\nSo when I look at my Network Utility,\n\n281\n00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.780\nI can look at my Thunderbolt\nethernet adapter.\n\n282\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.990\nAnd this one says that I'm not connected,\nright?\n\n283\n00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.930\nSo this is our Thunderbolt Ethernet\nadapter that's apparently not plugged in.\n\n284\n00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.580\nCuz it doesn't have an IP address, and\nthere's no traffic moving across it.\n\n285\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.040\nI've got more than one so\nlet's try until I find the right one.\n\n286\n00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.730\nThere we go.\n\n287\n00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.250\nHere's the, nope, this is the one\nthat's running I wonder why it's.\n\n288\n00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.740\nI know why it's not showing an address.\n\n289\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.030\nSo this is my\nThunderbolt Ethernet adapter.\n\n290\n00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.650\nIt's plugged in.\n\n291\n00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.280\nIt's got this MAC address\nthat ends in 80:b2.\n\n292\n00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.020\nIf I have any doubts that this is\nthe one I'm actually using, I can go and\n\n293\n00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.600\nverify it from the command line.\n\n294\n00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.070\nBut the real way I know\nI'm using it is over here.\n\n295\n00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.370\nI can see my sent and receive packets and\nsee how they're increasing.\n\n296\n00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.020\nThat means I've got data\nmoving over this line.\n\n297\n00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.300\nSo I know it's the right one, okay.\n\n298\n00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:48.200\nThis is my Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter,\nand notice, it's 100 megabits.\n\n299\n00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.850\nIt's a gigabit adapter.\n\n300\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.790\nIt's plugged into a Thunderbolt port which\ncan do 10 gigabit if it really wants.\n\n301\n00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.080\nBut the network that I'm plugged into,\n\n302\n00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.200\nthe port on the switch on the port that\nI'm plugged into is only a 100 megabit.\n\n303\n00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.600\nWhen I look at my wireless network,\nwhen I go over to Wi-Fi.\n\n304\n00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.940\nHere it is.\n\n305\n00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.490\nAnd notice my Wi-Fi is 300 megabit.\n\n306\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.800\nIt's because there's an 802.11N network\nand I'm really close to that access point.\n\n307\n00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.530\nI'm getting a really strong signal.\n\n308\n00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.690\nI might prefer to use the wireless\nover wired in this case cuz I'm\n\n309\n00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.990\ngonna get a faster connection\nthrough that wireless.\n\n310\n00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.905\nAccess point, right?\n\n311\n00:14:18.905 --> 00:14:21.100\nBut that's not what your\nMac's gonna default to.\n\n312\n00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.835\nYour Mac is gonna default to\npreferring wired over wireless,\n\n313\n00:14:23.835 --> 00:14:25.380\ncuz wired is more reliable.\n\n314\n00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.420\nAnd we can change all that.\n\n315\n00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.670\nNow before I go and change it,\nI just wanna point out one thing.\n\n316\n00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.830\nWhen I went to my Thunderbolt Ethernet,\nand\n\n317\n00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:34.830\nit showed that it had no IP Address,\nthat seems a little weird, doesn't it?\n\n318\n00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.160\nWell, the reason is that I have\na Thunderbolt Ethernet bridge.\n\n319\n00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.690\nIt's because my virtual machines, and\nthe IP address is tied to that bridge,\n\n320\n00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.520\nand not tied to the physical adapter.\n\n321\n00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.710\nThe network utility doesn't show me that\nbridge, so it doesn't show up in here.\n\n322\n00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.902\nBut that's why it doesn't have an IP.\n\n323\n00:14:47.902 --> 00:14:53.580\nAll right, so if I jump back in here, I\nmight want to prefer wireless over wired.\n\n324\n00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.760\nAnd so down at the bottom of the screen,\nI can hit the little gear.\n\n325\n00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.010\nAnd under the gear,\nyou'll see Set Service Order.\n\n326\n00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.420\nAnd this is where we can define\nwhich one is preferred over another.\n\n327\n00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.100\nAnd so I'm gonna do that.\n\n328\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.410\nI'll hit Set Service Order, and\nthen in here, I can find my Wi-Fi.\n\n329\n00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:13.635\nAnd I'm gonna move it up to the top, and\nso Thunderbolt Ethernet will be second.\n\n330\n00:15:13.635 --> 00:15:15.150\nWi-Fi is preferred, right?\n\n331\n00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.670\nSo there's my connections the way that\nI want them to be, and when I say OK.\n\n332\n00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.010\nThey flipped around in the background,\nand now I prefer the wireless.\n\n333\n00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.520\nSo now when I communicate,\nI'm gonna use that 300 megabit connection.\n\n334\n00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.000\nUnderstand that most\ncompanies are investing\n\n335\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.740\nheavily in their wireless networks.\n\n336\n00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.030\nAnd they're not investing in their\nphysical networks anymore, and so\n\n337\n00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.570\nyou may find that your wireless network is\nactually better than the physical one, and\n\n338\n00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.075\nyou wanna change that search order\njust like I did right there.\n\n339\n00:15:38.075 --> 00:15:39.250\nRight?\n\n340\n00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.330\nNow, when they're connected they\nappear at the top of the list.\n\n341\n00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.390\nIf I disconnect they're gonna drop, right?\n\n342\n00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.440\nSo if I disconnect my wireless connection.\n\n343\n00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.510\nI'm going to turn off Wi-Fi.\n\n344\n00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.400\nWhen I turn it off, see how\nThunderbolt jumped back up to the top,\n\n345\n00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.295\nand Wi-Fi dropped down here.\n\n346\n00:15:54.295 --> 00:15:56.980\nOkay.\nWhat's going on is it's off.\n\n347\n00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.316\nWhy prioritize something that's off?\n\n348\n00:15:58.316 --> 00:16:00.114\nThat's off and moves it down in the list.\n\n349\n00:16:00.114 --> 00:16:04.683\nAnd if I turn it back on, well, then it's\ngonna move back up to the top of the list.\n\n350\n00:16:04.683 --> 00:16:05.693\nAnd so, there it goes.\n\n351\n00:16:05.693 --> 00:16:10.000\nAnd it's gonna jump back up as\nsoon as it gets an address.\n\n352\n00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.058\nAnd see how it's not above\nThunderbolt Ethernet yet.\n\n353\n00:16:14.058 --> 00:16:14.998\nIt's right here.\n\n354\n00:16:14.998 --> 00:16:17.220\nEither one of two things happened.\n\n355\n00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.910\nEither one it hasn't\ngotten an IP address yet.\n\n356\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.910\nSo it takes it a second for\nit to take over.\n\n357\n00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.698\nOr two, I don't think I hit Apply when\nI changed the order [LAUGH] and so,\n\n358\n00:16:24.698 --> 00:16:26.470\nit's reverted my change back.\n\n359\n00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.080\nSo let me go back in here to\nset the service order and\n\n360\n00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.440\nsure enough I didn't hit Apply.\n\n361\n00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.525\nSo let me move that one back up and\n\n362\n00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:36.547\nas soon as I've got it back\nup I can hit OK in it.\n\n363\n00:16:36.547 --> 00:16:39.474\nIt takes effect right away when you hit\nOK, but you actually have to hit Apply\n\n364\n00:16:39.474 --> 00:16:41.790\ndown here at the bottom for\nit to save it, I didn't do that.\n\n365\n00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.720\nSo there we go.\n\n366\n00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.210\nSo that's how we can set our system for\nwireless.\n\n367\n00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.241\nThen, we gotta configure our system\nto actually get connected to it.\n\n368\n00:16:50.241 --> 00:16:52.770\nAnd I'm connected to a network right now.\n\n369\n00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.460\nAnd so, it shows that I'm connected and\nI'm on it.\n\n370\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.300\nBut when we go to connect to a network\nthere's actually a few different\n\n371\n00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.370\nthings that happen.\n\n372\n00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.860\nFirst off, you're gonna see your\nwireless signal right up here.\n\n373\n00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.330\nSo you'll have that little wireless\nlogo right up in your menu bar.\n\n374\n00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:07.620\nAnd when you click it,\n\n375\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.740\nit's gonna show you each of the different\nnetworks that are out there.\n\n376\n00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.670\nAnd so, I see the ones that I'm able\nto view in this studio right now.\n\n377\n00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:21.740\nThere's ITProTV, there's NH-ASO, Private,\nPublic, all these different networks.\n\n378\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.013\nThis is ours, ITProTV.\n\n379\n00:17:23.013 --> 00:17:24.683\nThese other ones are our\nneighbors I guess,\n\n380\n00:17:24.683 --> 00:17:26.560\nother people that are in the building.\n\n381\n00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.910\nSo you see these different networks.\n\n382\n00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.950\nWhen you go to connect,\n\n383\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.230\nthese little symbols here will\nshow that signal strength.\n\n384\n00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:38.410\nHow strong is the access point signal and\nthen whether it's a secured network.\n\n385\n00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.201\nMost wireless networks these days\nare secured, so they have a lock and\n\n386\n00:17:41.201 --> 00:17:43.632\nthat means you've got provide\na password to get connected.\n\n387\n00:17:43.632 --> 00:17:45.334\nIf they don't have a lock,\nthey're unsecured,\n\n388\n00:17:45.334 --> 00:17:47.030\nyou can connect it without a password.\n\n389\n00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.130\nThat's not very safe, is it?\n\n390\n00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.650\nAnybody can just come up and connect.\n\n391\n00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.535\nWell, you'll see like here,\n\n392\n00:17:51.535 --> 00:17:56.250\nTim's printer he's got it setup\nwhere it doesn't require a password.\n\n393\n00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.780\nAnybody can walk up with their tablet or\nphone and connect his printer and\n\n394\n00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:00.900\nprint things.\n\n395\n00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.950\nYou might not want that in a busy office\nbuilding where people like to pull pranks,\n\n396\n00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.650\nbut if it's just in your office and\n\n397\n00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.660\nit's a weak wireless signal that\ndoesn't get very far, then this works.\n\n398\n00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.110\nNow, I'll tell you, that printer,\nit's on the other side of the building.\n\n399\n00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.550\nSo this is a pretty strong signal.\n\n400\n00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.420\nHe might wanna change that and\nturn on some security.\n\n401\n00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.460\nAnd when you connect to a network though,\nit's gonna connect up and\n\n402\n00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.440\nit's gonna require a password.\n\n403\n00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.880\nNow, notice these two other wireless\nnetworks that are showing up here.\n\n404\n00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.360\nDon Pezet's iPad and Don's iPhone 6s.\n\n405\n00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.541\nThat's my phone and my iPad.\n\n406\n00:18:28.541 --> 00:18:30.760\nNow, my phone is right here in my pocket.\n\n407\n00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.130\nMy iPad is on the other side\nof the building also but\n\n408\n00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.660\nit's strong enough that\nI'm able to see it here.\n\n409\n00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.930\nAnd instead of a wireless signal,\nit's got this two little links.\n\n410\n00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.970\nAnd what those are, are personal hotspots.\n\n411\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.734\nI can tether to them.\n\n412\n00:18:43.734 --> 00:18:47.204\nIn other words, if I don't have Internet\naccess I can tether to that phone,\n\n413\n00:18:47.204 --> 00:18:48.880\nI can tether to that iPad.\n\n414\n00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.930\nAnd I can use them to get on the Internet\nthrough their cellular connections.\n\n415\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.111\nI'm gonna use WiFi.\n\n416\n00:18:54.111 --> 00:18:58.430\nWiFi from my laptop to that device and\nthen from that device we'll use a cellular\n\n417\n00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.540\nnetwork to get out that's another type\nof wireless network that's out there.\n\n418\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.330\nNow, those are normally be\nsecured to minor my key chain, so\n\n419\n00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.070\nright there I'm ready to connect to them.\n\n420\n00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.590\nBut if a stranger were to\nwalk into the building,\n\n421\n00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:12.653\nthey might see these networks and\nthey might have to provide authentication.\n\n422\n00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:16.168\nNow, I'm already connected to ITProTV,\nbut let's do this.\n\n423\n00:19:16.168 --> 00:19:20.040\nLet's say that I wasn't\nconnected to these things.\n\n424\n00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.850\nWhen you go into your WiFi connection,\n\n425\n00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.480\nit already shows networks\nthat you know about.\n\n426\n00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.140\nIt's ready to connect.\n\n427\n00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.790\nYou can even join other networks.\n\n428\n00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.000\nIf you go into Advanced, under Advanced,\n\n429\n00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.990\nit will show you every network\nyou've ever connected to.\n\n430\n00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:33.520\nIt stores them, it saves them right here.\n\n431\n00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.440\nAnd it actually saves them\ninto your key chain, too.\n\n432\n00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.640\nSo if you have multiple devices and\nyou're synchronizing your key chain,\n\n433\n00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.010\nall those devices will be able to\nconnect to the wireless network.\n\n434\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.355\nSo for example, here's the DeltaSkyClub.\n\n435\n00:19:43.355 --> 00:19:46.535\nWell, I was at an airport at some point,\nI must have flown Delta, and\n\n436\n00:19:46.535 --> 00:19:48.315\nI got on one of their wireless networks.\n\n437\n00:19:48.315 --> 00:19:51.335\nOr In-room Guest WiFi (Disney).\n\n438\n00:19:51.335 --> 00:19:52.325\nI must have been at Disney world.\n\n439\n00:19:52.325 --> 00:19:55.735\nI don't remember when, but [LAUGH] or\nsomebody stole my laptop and\n\n440\n00:19:55.735 --> 00:19:58.655\nwent to Disney world, and they connected\nto that wireless network and it stored and\n\n441\n00:19:58.655 --> 00:19:59.565\nit's saved right there.\n\n442\n00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:02.093\nAnd see how it says security none,\nthey don't have passwords.\n\n443\n00:20:02.093 --> 00:20:06.830\nBut here's Pezet-Private,\nthat's my wireless network at home.\n\n444\n00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.900\nI can't see it right now, it's not in\nrange and so it doesn't show up up here,\n\n445\n00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.610\nbut it shows up in this list because\nwhen I go home I wanna connect to it.\n\n446\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.820\nAnd at home,\nI've got it secured with WPA2 Personal.\n\n447\n00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.150\nWhat is that?\n\n448\n00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.440\nWell, there's three types of\nencryption that are available on most\n\n449\n00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.670\nwireless networks.\n\n450\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.140\nThere's WEP, WEP is\nthe Wired Equivalent Privacy Protocol.\n\n451\n00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.330\nSo what WEP does, is it provides\na basic level of encryption and\n\n452\n00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.910\nit was designed back in the late 1990s or\nearly 2000s where they just wanted to\n\n453\n00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.720\ncreate basic encryption\non a wireless network.\n\n454\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.568\nWell, it wasn't very good.\n\n455\n00:20:43.568 --> 00:20:45.751\nAnd within a year it was showing\nthat it could be broken.\n\n456\n00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:51.550\nAnd now, like 16 years later,\nyou can break WEP really easy.\n\n457\n00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.126\nSo WEP encryption is not acceptable,\nyou really don't wanna use that one.\n\n458\n00:20:55.126 --> 00:20:57.263\nSo the replacement for WEP was WPA.\n\n459\n00:20:57.263 --> 00:21:00.134\nWPA is the WiFi Protected Access, and\n\n460\n00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:04.970\nWPA provided a stronger type\nof encryption called TKIP.\n\n461\n00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:09.340\nAnd it was good at the time, but\nit's been shown to be weak, and\n\n462\n00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.540\nit actually can be broken today.\n\n463\n00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.190\nAnd so, the replacement for it was WPA2,\nand WPA2 has been around for\n\n464\n00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:16.040\nover ten years now.\n\n465\n00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.300\nIt's been around a long time.\n\n466\n00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.090\nAnd it uses AAS CCMP encryption.\n\n467\n00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:21.960\nDon't worry about memorizing\nthe encryption for the exam.\n\n468\n00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.390\nJust know that it's really strong.\n\n469\n00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:26.680\nAnd that WPA2 is the only one that's\nreally trustworthy these days.\n\n470\n00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.620\nSo if you're gonna secure\nyour wireless network,\n\n471\n00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.254\nyou're gonna wanna secure it with WPA2.\n\n472\n00:21:30.254 --> 00:21:32.298\nNow, your Mac supports all three.\n\n473\n00:21:32.298 --> 00:21:34.818\nIt supports WEP, WPA and WPA2.\n\n474\n00:21:34.818 --> 00:21:38.393\nSo it'll connect to any of them but\nyou want to use WPA2.\n\n475\n00:21:38.393 --> 00:21:40.488\nAnd so, you can see I'm using that\non my own network right there.\n\n476\n00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.022\nSo when I go to get connected\nto a wireless network,\n\n477\n00:21:44.022 --> 00:21:46.914\nif it's using encryption I'm\ngoing to have to authenticate.\n\n478\n00:21:46.914 --> 00:21:50.600\nAnd you'll see where 802.1X is there also.\n\n479\n00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.480\nWell, 802.1X, I talked about that for\nphysical authentication.\n\n480\n00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.630\nIt can be used in wireless also.\n\n481\n00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.160\nAnd in fact, if you're using WPA2,\n\n482\n00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.990\nthe way it does it's\nauthentication is by using 802.1X.\n\n483\n00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:05.120\nSo it's really leveraging 802.1X with\nan encryption protocol to give you\n\n484\n00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:05.826\nnice security.\n\n485\n00:22:05.826 --> 00:22:08.010\nSo that's kinda what I see here and\n\n486\n00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.510\nthese are all the different networks\nthat are present and if I go in here and\n\n487\n00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:15.180\nfind some of these,\nI've connected with ton networks.\n\n488\n00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.802\nThere's ITProTV.\n\n489\n00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:19.704\nI'm gonna remove ITProTV, so\nI'm gonna disconnect from that.\n\n490\n00:22:19.704 --> 00:22:21.820\nAnd it looks like I got\na few of them here.\n\n491\n00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:26.305\nSo let me just remove each of the various\nITProTV networks that I've seen as we've\n\n492\n00:22:26.305 --> 00:22:29.108\nupgraded our equipment or\ndowngraded equipment.\n\n493\n00:22:29.108 --> 00:22:31.670\nWe get this networks to appear and\ndisappear.\n\n494\n00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:35.092\nSo let me just remove every\nITProTV one from the list.\n\n495\n00:22:35.092 --> 00:22:39.633\nSo let's say that I am just walking\ninto this building for the first time.\n\n496\n00:22:39.633 --> 00:22:42.510\nI'm gonna see this signal up here.\n\n497\n00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.190\nMy wireless network is not connected.\n\n498\n00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.210\nIt's scanning, it's looking for\nnetworks that I know about.\n\n499\n00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.220\nAnd if it can find them, great.\n\n500\n00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.850\nAnd if it can't,\nI get the little gray symbol right here,\n\n501\n00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.100\nlet's me know I'm not connected\nto a wireless network at all.\n\n502\n00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.462\nAnd if I click on that,\nI'll see that I've got some options.\n\n503\n00:22:59.462 --> 00:23:01.389\nNow, these are the networks\nthat I've found and\n\n504\n00:23:01.389 --> 00:23:03.160\nI can connect to any one\nof them that I want.\n\n505\n00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.160\nAnd so, if I choose ITPRoTV, it's locked.\n\n506\n00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.670\nAnd it's gonna tell me that it's\nusing WPA2 so I know it's secure.\n\n507\n00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.210\nAnd I need to provide a password.\n\n508\n00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.740\nAnd if I'm only gonna connect one time,\n\n509\n00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.790\nthen I can enter in that password and\nI can uncheck this.\n\n510\n00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.090\nI'll connect one time,\nthen it won't remember it.\n\n511\n00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.238\nThat's probably what I should\nhave done in the airport or\n\n512\n00:23:24.238 --> 00:23:26.128\nat Disney cuz I know I'm\nnot gonna connect again.\n\n513\n00:23:26.128 --> 00:23:30.250\nBut if this is something I'm connecting to\nall the time, I can remember the network.\n\n514\n00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.710\nAnd when I do that, it's gonna save\nit along with the passwords, so\n\n515\n00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:34.740\nif I ever come back and\n\n516\n00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.220\nhit this network again, it will be able\nto jump right on it and I'm connected.\n\n517\n00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.740\nSo that system works, it's in place,\nand it's a great thing.\n\n518\n00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.894\nAnd if I've got my key chain\nsynchronization configured and iCloud,\n\n519\n00:23:44.894 --> 00:23:47.086\nit will synchronize that\nbetween the systems and\n\n520\n00:23:47.086 --> 00:23:49.184\nI never have to remember\nthat password again.\n\n521\n00:23:49.184 --> 00:23:53.078\nI know my sister in law's network was in\nthere, so every time I go to their house,\n\n522\n00:23:53.078 --> 00:23:55.943\nI can never remember their password,\nbut I don't have to,\n\n523\n00:23:55.943 --> 00:23:58.038\ncuz it's remembered there in the laptop.\n\n524\n00:23:58.038 --> 00:24:00.794\nFor most people that's the extent of\nyour wireless configuration right there.\n\n525\n00:24:00.794 --> 00:24:01.641\nYou don't have to do anything more.\n\n526\n00:24:01.641 --> 00:24:04.045\nBut there are a lot of\nother things we can do.\n\n527\n00:24:04.045 --> 00:24:07.600\nSo let me just highlight some of those\nones that might show up on the exam.\n\n528\n00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.870\nFor example there might be more\nthan one network in your building.\n\n529\n00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.240\nAnd so you might have to pick and choose.\n\n530\n00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.740\nYou'll connect to whatever one you\nwere connected to last time but\n\n531\n00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:15.530\nyou might need to switch.\n\n532\n00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.720\nAnd you can switch easily\nby using the menu bar,\n\n533\n00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.080\nwhich I think I've already shown but\nlet me bring it up here again.\n\n534\n00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.640\nIn my menu bar up here on the laptop\n\n535\n00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.760\nif I bring that down I can just\nquickly switch to another network.\n\n536\n00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.510\nAnd I'll jump over to it.\n\n537\n00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.990\nYou can do the same thing through\nsystem preferences right here.\n\n538\n00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.690\nIf you just drop this down and\npick the other network.\n\n539\n00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.040\nNow some networks advertise themselves\nlike what you're seeing here.\n\n540\n00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.660\nThe ITProTV network was advertised.\n\n541\n00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.450\nMy laptop found it.\n\n542\n00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.440\nBut some networks hide themselves.\n\n543\n00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.950\nIf it's a hidden network you might need\nto go down to Join Other Network...\n\n544\n00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:47.870\nAnd when you do that you have to type\nin the name of the network cuz it's not\n\n545\n00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:48.850\nadvertising itself.\n\n546\n00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.990\nSo I would have to say\nthat it's ITProTV and\n\n547\n00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:55.100\nthen you have to tell it\nwhat security it's using.\n\n548\n00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.170\nIs it using WEP, WPA, or WPA2?\n\n549\n00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:01.500\nAnd notice how it does WPA/WPA2.\n\n550\n00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.890\nIt's actually mixed mode.\n\n551\n00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.760\nOr just WPA2.\n\n552\n00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.740\nAll right, notice how there's personal and\nenterprise.\n\n553\n00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.170\nWhat's the difference?\n\n554\n00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.820\nWell, personal is what we're most used to.\n\n555\n00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.290\nIt's what I showed you just a minute ago.\n\n556\n00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.690\nYou connect, and you type in a password.\n\n557\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:18.320\nThe problem with personal is\nthere's only one password.\n\n558\n00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.990\nSo, if a hundred people come visit, I have\nto give a hundred people that password.\n\n559\n00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:24.220\nWhat happens when I wanna\nchange that password?\n\n560\n00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.010\nIf I wanna change that, have to tell all\n100 people, hey there is new password,\n\n561\n00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:28.890\nsorry about that guys.\n\n562\n00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:33.620\nWPA Enterprise fixes that, it fixes\nthat by using certificates instead.\n\n563\n00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.450\nEvery user is given a certificate,\na little digital\n\n564\n00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:41.430\nkey it basically a password that each\nof them has that's unique to them.\n\n565\n00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.910\nAnd when they connect,\nthey connect with their unique key.\n\n566\n00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.250\nIf somebody gets fired,\nyou get a disgruntled employee,\n\n567\n00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.730\nI just wanna cut somebody off.\n\n568\n00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.410\nAll I do is disable their key.\n\n569\n00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:51.540\nIt doesn't affect anybody else.\n\n570\n00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.780\nEverybody else has their own keys.\n\n571\n00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:57.050\nWith WPA-Personal everybody shares a key.\n\n572\n00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.780\nSo if I change it, it affects everybody.\n\n573\n00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:04.000\nWith WPA-Enterprise everybody has\ntheir own key, their own certificate.\n\n574\n00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.560\nNow certificate management is a big deal\nand we talk about it in the server shows,\n\n575\n00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.970\nso definitely check it out there.\n\n576\n00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:11.250\nBut you can't just turn it on and\nsay it's on.\n\n577\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.160\nYou have to set up a certificate server.\n\n578\n00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.610\nYou have to issue the keys to people.\n\n579\n00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.810\nAny time you hire somebody new\nyou gotta issue a key to them and\n\n580\n00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:17.770\nadd it to the system.\n\n581\n00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:18.620\nIt's a lot of work.\n\n582\n00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.360\nYou have to setup what's call the PKI,\na Public Key Infrastructure.\n\n583\n00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.670\nSo, most people just use WPA-Personal\neven in businesses cuz it's simpler,\n\n584\n00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:27.960\nit's easy to deploy.\n\n585\n00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.571\nBut WPA-Enterprise gives you the best\nsecurity, the best solution.\n\n586\n00:26:32.742 --> 00:26:34.983\nAll right, so if I'm gonna connect\nto a network that's hidden,\n\n587\n00:26:34.983 --> 00:26:35.930\nI gotta punch that data in.\n\n588\n00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.810\nBut after that, I connect up and\nit's no big deal.\n\n589\n00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.070\nIt's just like any other network.\n\n590\n00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:40.369\nI just have to tell the system about it.\n\n591\n00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.820\nThe other thing is, you'll notice, the\nadvanced button down here at the bottom.\n\n592\n00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.830\nIf I go into advanced,\nI can configure a ton of other things.\n\n593\n00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.490\nLike whether I remember\nthe networks I connect to,\n\n594\n00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.080\nwhether I want to create\ncomputer to computer networks.\n\n595\n00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.870\nThese are called ad hoc networks.\n\n596\n00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:58.390\nMaybe I've got my laptop and\nDaniel comes in with his laptop and\n\n597\n00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.390\nI just want to exchange\nsome photos with him.\n\n598\n00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.110\nWe can create an ad hoc network.\n\n599\n00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:04.840\nJust a wireless network that\nonly exists between our laptops.\n\n600\n00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.170\nWe don't need a router or an access point.\n\n601\n00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:09.360\nWe're just communicating directly and\nyou can build that pretty easily.\n\n602\n00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.740\nNow most of us don't use that anymore\nbecause you've got AirDrop and\n\n603\n00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.450\nother technologies.\n\n604\n00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:15.570\nBut this one's been here a long time,\nthe support's still there.\n\n605\n00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:19.440\nYou can change networks, so you can make\nit require an administrator to change\n\n606\n00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.429\nthe networks if you wanna flip or\nkeep people locked to one and\n\n607\n00:27:22.429 --> 00:27:26.315\nrequire an administrator to authorize\nwhether wireless is on or off, right?\n\n608\n00:27:26.315 --> 00:27:27.560\nTo turn it on or to turn it off.\n\n609\n00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.100\nSome other things we can adjust,\nwe can manually set IP's.\n\n610\n00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.370\nJust like on physical adapters\nyou can manually set an IP.\n\n611\n00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:37.850\nYou can do DNS settings, WINS, 802.1x\nall this things you can do in a regular\n\n612\n00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:41.460\nphysical adapter,\nyou can do it right here on wi-fi, right?\n\n613\n00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:47.150\nSo pretty easy to get that stuff put\nin place and get it off and running.\n\n614\n00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:48.920\nSo that's pretty much it for\nwireless networks today.\n\n615\n00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.770\nThey're pretty straightforward,\neasy things to get connected to.\n\n616\n00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.460\nThat technology in it of\nitself is really prevalent.\n\n617\n00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.920\nEvery Mac Mini has\nwireless in it these days.\n\n618\n00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.930\nEvery Macbook Pro has wireless, and\nthe Mac Pros, they have wireless in them,\n\n619\n00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.660\nso tt used to be that it\nwas a laptop only thing.\n\n620\n00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.950\nNow laptops and desktops all have wireless\ntechnologies built right in to them.\n\n621\n00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:10.810\nYou are going to have to configure it and\n\n622\n00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:15.740\nthere are times when the wireless network\nmaybe preferred over the wired network.\n\n623\n00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.890\nAnd so just be aware that you might need\nto change that order to make it prefer\n\n624\n00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:19.770\none network over the other.\n\n625\n00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:23.220\nSo those are all different things that\nwe need to be aware of with wireless.\n\n626\n00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.950\nLast thing I wanna mention is that if\nyou're having problems with wireless,\n\n627\n00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:30.270\nthe number one problem with\nwireless is signal strength.\n\n628\n00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:34.630\nThat your access point might\nbe right next to you, but\n\n629\n00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.005\nthere's things that can\ncause Interference.\n\n630\n00:28:37.005 --> 00:28:39.465\nSo a lot of modern access points\nrunning more than one frequency.\n\n631\n00:28:39.465 --> 00:28:42.795\nA lot of them run at 2.4 gigahertz and\nsome of them run 5 gigahertz but\n\n632\n00:28:42.795 --> 00:28:44.385\nmost of them run at both.\n\n633\n00:28:44.385 --> 00:28:48.625\nAnd so your access point will reflect\nthat and we've got it's an Apple airport.\n\n634\n00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:53.525\nIt is literally if I can walk straight to\nit it's about 15 feet away from here so\n\n635\n00:28:53.525 --> 00:28:55.720\nit is not far away at all.\n\n636\n00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.870\nBut I've got the studio wall\nright here about six feet away,\n\n637\n00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:02.320\nand then there's a four foot hallway,\nand then there's another wall.\n\n638\n00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.090\nAnd on the other side of that\nwall is the access point is.\n\n639\n00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:07.220\nSo there are two walls in between me and\nthat access point.\n\n640\n00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.700\nAt only 15 feet away,\nI take signal degradation.\n\n641\n00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.330\nLet me show you,\nI've got a little program called NetSpot.\n\n642\n00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:18.930\nIn Mac OS you get these\nlittle status bars here.\n\n643\n00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:20.690\nAnd see how it shows me with four bars?\n\n644\n00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:23.480\nI've got the strongest signal possible,\nright?\n\n645\n00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.580\nBut if I go into NetSpot I can see that\nmy signal actually isn't that strong.\n\n646\n00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.830\nSo the network that I'm connected\nto is this one right here.\n\n647\n00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:30.750\nIt's in bold.\n\n648\n00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.520\nSo this is the ITProTV\nnetwork I'm connected to.\n\n649\n00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.270\nAnd see how there's four ITProTV networks?\n\n650\n00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:36.670\nWhy are there four?\n\n651\n00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:41.240\nWell, we have two airports,\none at each end of the studio.\n\n652\n00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:46.043\nAnd each airport is running at 2.4 GHz and\n5 GHz.\n\n653\n00:29:46.043 --> 00:29:49.597\nThey're running at both frequencies and\nbecause they're doing that I can connect\n\n654\n00:29:49.597 --> 00:29:52.095\non either frequency which\never one is stronger.\n\n655\n00:29:52.095 --> 00:29:55.540\n2.4 GHz gets longer range but\nslower speeds.\n\n656\n00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.960\n5 GHz has a shorter range but\nhigher speeds.\n\n657\n00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.020\nSo hopefully I'm connected 5 GHz but\nI might not be.\n\n658\n00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.820\nAnd so\nwhen I scroll over here I'll see I am.\n\n659\n00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.130\nI'm connected to the 5 GHz one.\n\n660\n00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:09.150\nAnd I hope so cuz the access point's\nright there, it's just 15 feet away.\n\n661\n00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.730\nBut when I go and look at the strength.\n\n662\n00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:16.830\nApple is telling me I've got four bars,\nI got the strongest signal possible.\n\n663\n00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:20.550\nBut you can see right here my\nsignal strength is only about\n\n664\n00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.490\nhalf is good as it should be.\n\n665\n00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.980\nIf I were standing right next to that\naccess point with no interruptions\n\n666\n00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.390\nthis green bar would be\nall the way over here.\n\n667\n00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.270\nBut instead I'm right on the cusp\nwhere it's turning orange and\n\n668\n00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.040\ngreen because I have two\nwalls in between me.\n\n669\n00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.520\nSo walls really impact wireless.\n\n670\n00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.000\nAnd that's why a lot of us\nprefer the wired connection.\n\n671\n00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.460\nWith a wired connection you plug it in,\nyou got 100% signal strength all the time.\n\n672\n00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.090\nWireless depends on other things.\n\n673\n00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.070\nIt depends on how many obstructions\nare between you and the access point.\n\n674\n00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:53.410\nHow many other people are on the network.\n\n675\n00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:57.620\nAnd whether there's other wireless\ndevices generating interference.\n\n676\n00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.820\nNotice when I look at this network,\n\n677\n00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.180\nI scroll over here it shows\nthat channels it's running on.\n\n678\n00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.760\nSo I'm running on channel 157.\n\n679\n00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.220\nIf somebody else was on channel 157,\n\n680\n00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.780\nthey would be battling my signal,\nthey would weaken my signal.\n\n681\n00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.530\nSee how there's more than one\naccess point on channel 11?\n\n682\n00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.595\nThose three guys are all\nfighting against each other.\n\n683\n00:31:17.595 --> 00:31:21.110\nThey're bumping in each other and\nit's weakening their signal as a result.\n\n684\n00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:24.410\nSo those are things that we need to\nbe aware of in the wireless world\n\n685\n00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.541\nthat kind of are different\nthan on a wired connection.\n\n686\n00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.520\nAll right, well that's a pretty good\nrun down of wireless network and\n\n687\n00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.610\nthe things we need to know.\n\n688\n00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:35.470\nWe'll talk just a here more about wireless\nnetworking and troubleshooting but\n\n689\n00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:38.410\nas far as getting us setup once\nyou attach the wireless network,\n\n690\n00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:40.045\nit's really just like\nany physical networks.\n\n691\n00:31:40.045 --> 00:31:41.390\nSo nothing too crazy there.\n\n692\n00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:42.630\nAll the other settings are present.\n\n693\n00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:45.030\nYou can jump in, make the changes and\ndo what you need.\n\n694\n00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:48.620\nSo that's pretty much that and this is\na pretty good spot to wrap this one up.\n\n695\n00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.130\nSo in this episode we talked\nabout wireless networking.\n\n696\n00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:52.450\nWe talked about physical too.\n\n697\n00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.850\nAll the different settings\nin between them and\n\n698\n00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.020\nthe concerns we have\nwith wireless networking.\n\n699\n00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.530\nIt's a pretty good run down of all the\nthings we need to know for the exam and\n\n700\n00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.330\nstuff that you are going\nto see in the real world.\n\n701\n00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:03.210\nWell, I hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n702\n00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:06.550\nStay tuned, cuz we got more Apple\nCertified Support Professional coming up.\n\n703\n00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:09.530\nI know, we still need to talk to about\nnetwork locations and troubleshooting, so\n\n704\n00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.390\nwe'll see those in the next part.\n\n705\n00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:12.420\nHopefully you'll be there for it.\n\n706\n00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.480\nI hope to see you then.\n\n707\n00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.400\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n708\n00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:19.125\nAnd signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet, and I'll see you next time.\n\n709\n00:32:19.125 --> 00:32:24.011\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.280\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.480\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\nback again with another episode of\n\n5\n00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.500\nApple Certified Support Professional,\nand once again I'm all by my lonesome.\n\n6\n00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.011\nBut that's all right, because we're still\ndealing with some network configurations.\n\n7\n00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:29.360\nWe're gonna jump right in,\nand start to work with that.\n\n8\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.900\nNow this is part three,\nor part four actually,\n\n9\n00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.380\nI'm losing track myself,\nof network configuration.\n\n10\n00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.860\nAnd I know what you're thinking, what else\ncan I even talk about, it's been so much.\n\n11\n00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.560\nAnd you're right, I've kinda run\nout of things to talk about.\n\n12\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.570\nSo what we're gonna talk about\nthis time is troubleshooting.\n\n13\n00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.690\nIn the first three episodes, we got\na chance to see how to configure things,\n\n14\n00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.060\nhow to get them set up.\n\n15\n00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.170\nBut what about when things aren't\nworking the way they're supposed to?\n\n16\n00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.600\nWell, there are a whole collection of\ntools and features that are available for\n\n17\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.700\nus to use to verify whether or\n\n18\n00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.500\nnot the network is functioning\nthe way that it's supposed to.\n\n19\n00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.020\nSo we're gonna look at that and kind of\nrehash some of those tools and the stuff\n\n20\n00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.060\nthat we can use just to make sure that\nthings are running the way that we want.\n\n21\n00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.230\nThe thing I wanna start out with\nfirst are network locations.\n\n22\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.780\nAnd the reason I wanna start with\nnetwork locations is because they're\n\n23\n00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.170\npretty commonly misconfigured.\n\n24\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.620\nIn fact people usually\nturn them on by accident.\n\n25\n00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.350\nNetwork locations are not turned on by\ndefault, and so when somebody accidentally\n\n26\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.810\nturns them on, it can cause the network\nadapters to be configured wrong.\n\n27\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.830\nYou plug in your computer and\nit's not talking.\n\n28\n00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.630\nAnd so I'm kinda gotten in this habit\nwhere somebody brings me the computer and\n\n29\n00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.290\nsays, hey I can't talk on the network.\n\n30\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.640\nThe first thing I do is check to see\nwhether network locations are turned on.\n\n31\n00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.680\nAll right, now if you're not\nfamiliar with network locations,\n\n32\n00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.570\nI think we covered it\nbriefly in another episode,\n\n33\n00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.500\nlet's just take a quick kind of\ntour of that and how that works.\n\n34\n00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.560\nI've got a Mac set up here and\nit is stock installed El Capitan,\n\n35\n00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.318\nso I haven't really messed with it,\nit's just a base install.\n\n36\n00:01:47.318 --> 00:01:50.260\nAnd on a base install the network\nlocation feature is turned off,\n\n37\n00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.080\nit's not on by default and\nyou can spot it really easily.\n\n38\n00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.540\nLet me show you, so\nwhen I look at this desktop,\n\n39\n00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.090\nif I just go to my Apple menu,\nyou can spot if network locations\n\n40\n00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.910\nare turned on cuz you actually have an\nApple menu item here that says location.\n\n41\n00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.100\nYou can change your network location\nright there from the Apple menu and\n\n42\n00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.560\nif it's not there on the menu, it's not\nturned on so I can immediately rule\n\n43\n00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.710\nthat out as a problem on this\nlaptop if it's not connecting.\n\n44\n00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.500\nIf it is turned on we'll see it, right,\n\n45\n00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.600\nnow if you don't remember network\nlocations, let me explain what it is.\n\n46\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.950\nWhen you have a network adapter\nlike a wired network adapter,\n\n47\n00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.210\nyou might have certain settings you\nwant when you're at one location, and\n\n48\n00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.980\ndifferent settings at another location.\n\n49\n00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.200\nSo, for example, when I'm at home,\nI might want a static IP address.\n\n50\n00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.960\nBut when I'm here at the office,\nI might wanna use DHCP, or vice versa.\n\n51\n00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.450\nI might want DHCP at home, and\na static IP here at the office, right?\n\n52\n00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.220\nSo I can configure network\nlocations to allow that.\n\n53\n00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.610\nWith a wireless network,\nit happens automatically.\n\n54\n00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.610\nThe Mac remembers, when you're on this\nwireless network, you want this IP.\n\n55\n00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.310\nWhen you're on that wireless\nnetwork you want another one.\n\n56\n00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.410\nBut on a wired network,\n\n57\n00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.980\nwhen I physically plug in, how does it\nknow one network apart from another?\n\n58\n00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.320\nWell it has ways,\nit has ways to figure that out but\n\n59\n00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.600\nit's only got one configuration.\n\n60\n00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.640\nIf I jump into my System Preferences and\nI go into Network and\n\n61\n00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.110\nI choose an an Ethernet adapter,\nI just have one set of configurations,\n\n62\n00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.770\none IP address, I can set it to DHCP or\nI can set it manual, or that's it.\n\n63\n00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.440\nWell, there's actually\nanother option here,\n\n64\n00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.200\nuse DHCP with the manual address,\nthat says use DHCP by default, but\n\n65\n00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.280\nif you can't find a DHCP server use\nthis manual address, and you put one in.\n\n66\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.870\nSo you can do that.\n\n67\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.520\nBut what I want is I wanna use DHCP at\nwork and I wanna use a static IP at home.\n\n68\n00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.820\nSo to do that I need to define\nlocations and by default,\n\n69\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.650\nyou'll just see location, Automatic.\n\n70\n00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.025\nWhich means it works for\nwireless networks and for wired networks,\n\n71\n00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:43.949\nit really doesn't work.\n\n72\n00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.670\nYou can drop that down and\ncreate locations.\n\n73\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.790\nSo I'm gonna create two locations.\n\n74\n00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.920\nI'll create one location\nthat will be Home.\n\n75\n00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.390\nAnd I'll create another\nlocation that'll be Work.\n\n76\n00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.410\nAnd I'm just naming them.\n\n77\n00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.640\nYou can name them whatever you want.\n\n78\n00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.900\nThey can be airport or\n\n79\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.080\nwhatever you kind of name them, and all\nyou can really do is duplicate or rename.\n\n80\n00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.430\nYou can't really do anything here from\nlocation menu other than create them and\n\n81\n00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.180\ngive them a name, all right.\n\n82\n00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.240\nBut once you got that, you're gonna see\nyour network connections kinda reset.\n\n83\n00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.770\nAnd if you have virtual connections like\nVPN's and stuff, they'd all disappear.\n\n84\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.330\nDon't panic, they still exist.\n\n85\n00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.700\nThey existed under the Automatic profile.\n\n86\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.400\nAnd now when we go to Home or\nWork, that's an all new profile.\n\n87\n00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.730\nSo if you want to VPN to work from home,\nyou'll have to define it again under Home.\n\n88\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.930\nYou'll have to attach it to the different\nlocations where you want that to\n\n89\n00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:36.770\nwork from.\n\n90\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.110\nSo now if I choose Home,\nI get one group of settings.\n\n91\n00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.560\nSo maybe at home I want to use DHCP,\nthat's what I want.\n\n92\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.460\nBut when I'm at work,\nI want to use a static IP.\n\n93\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.962\nSo I can chose Work and I can come\ndown here and I can say Manually.\n\n94\n00:04:52.962 --> 00:04:57.596\nAnd I want to use 192.168.0.222 right,\n\n95\n00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:02.540\nthat's the IP address that I\nwant to use when I'm at work.\n\n96\n00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.100\nAnd so I come in and\nI punch in all of that information.\n\n97\n00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.820\nAnd I don't stop there, right, cuz I\nprobably need DNS servers and things.\n\n98\n00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.830\nSo maybe I go into my manual configuration\nand DNS and I'll add in some DNS servers.\n\n99\n00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.760\nI get that one punched in and\nlet me just add another one.\n\n100\n00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.079\nAll right, so those are gonna be\nthe two DNS servers that I use.\n\n101\n00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.030\nAnd so I've got those defined, all right.\n\n102\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.570\nI'm gonna hit apply to\nmake that take effect.\n\n103\n00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:36.590\nAnd now, when I'm at work, I'll have a\nstatic IP address with this configuration.\n\n104\n00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.635\nIf I'm at home, I'll choose Home,\nand see how it went back to DHCP.\n\n105\n00:05:41.635 --> 00:05:44.750\nSo it says at home use DHCP,\nat work use the static IP.\n\n106\n00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.790\nAll right, now it'll try and figure out\nwhich network I'm at based on my settings,\n\n107\n00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.460\nbut it doesn't necessarily do the greatest\njob and that's where the trouble comes in.\n\n108\n00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.770\nIs you get a user that comes in and\n\n109\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.920\nthey've accidentally turned\non locations like this and\n\n110\n00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.060\nthe Mac can't figure out which network\nit's on and it picks the wrong one.\n\n111\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.680\nAnd so now,\nmaybe I'm trying to use my work static IP\n\n112\n00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.770\nwhile I'm at home and\nthe IPs don't match up.\n\n113\n00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.840\nThe networks aren't the same.\n\n114\n00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.200\nThe router isn't the same or\nwhatever, and things break, right.\n\n115\n00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.020\nNetwork locations can\ncause a lot of problems.\n\n116\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.760\nThey're very convenient as long\nas people are educated to use it.\n\n117\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.010\nBut if they turn it on by accident,\nthen, you got a bit of a problem, right.\n\n118\n00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.720\nSo, once it's configured properly though,\nit's kinda nice because\n\n119\n00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.890\nall the user has to do is when they go to\nwork, they can hit their Apple menu and\n\n120\n00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.740\nsee my Apple menu,\nI now have this location item, and\n\n121\n00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.930\nthen go to location and they can choose,\nhey, I'm at work, let me choose Work.\n\n122\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.770\nI'm at home, let me choose Home.\n\n123\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.620\nIf they choose Automatic,\nit's gonna try and figure it out.\n\n124\n00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.720\nAre you at work or at you at home?\n\n125\n00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.440\nLet's figure it out for you.\n\n126\n00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.260\nAnd then it'll use the settings\nthat are appropriate, and\n\n127\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.230\nit may not pick the right ones, right?\n\n128\n00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.620\nIt has a hard time figuring out.\n\n129\n00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.888\nWireless is easy because\nyou can use the SSID,\n\n130\n00:06:54.888 --> 00:06:56.818\nit uses the identifier of the network.\n\n131\n00:06:56.818 --> 00:06:59.572\nOn a wired network, it uses the IP range,\n\n132\n00:06:59.572 --> 00:07:03.530\nbut you could have the same IP\nrange at home as you do at work.\n\n133\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.080\nAnd so then it relies on DNS suffixes.\n\n134\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.250\nWell, I didn't add any\nDNS suffixes to mine so\n\n135\n00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.650\nit doesn't know to use those either.\n\n136\n00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.190\nSo in my scenario,\nit doesn't have a way to tell that apart.\n\n137\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:15.980\nSo when I come in here and\n\n138\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.870\nI look at my Ethernet network, I set it\nto automatic and I'm just using DHCP.\n\n139\n00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.258\nIt didn't know that I\nwanted that static one.\n\n140\n00:07:23.258 --> 00:07:25.840\nSo when somebody says they can't connect,\nit's really easy to jump in to\n\n141\n00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.350\nthe configuration and\nstart to look at it and overlook location.\n\n142\n00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.038\nSo always pay attention to that.\n\n143\n00:07:31.038 --> 00:07:32.915\nI've gotten in the habit\nof hitting the Apple menu,\n\n144\n00:07:32.915 --> 00:07:36.850\ncuz if you see that Location item,\nthat's the dead giveaway that they got it.\n\n145\n00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.180\nIf it's on purpose,\nthen you just educate the user.\n\n146\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.650\nYou say,\nthese are the networks you need to choose.\n\n147\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.154\nFor you as the admin,\nyou need to know to come in here and\n\n148\n00:07:44.154 --> 00:07:46.065\nmake sure you're editing the right one.\n\n149\n00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:49.247\nIf I'm changing values I need to make\nsure I'm changing the work one and\n\n150\n00:07:49.247 --> 00:07:51.113\nnot the home one so that it'll function.\n\n151\n00:07:51.113 --> 00:07:54.185\nIf they turn it on by accident though,\nyou can turn it off,\n\n152\n00:07:54.185 --> 00:07:56.964\nthe way you turn it off is\nby deleting the locations.\n\n153\n00:07:56.964 --> 00:08:00.544\nSo, if I go to Edit Locations,\nI can take Home and delete it,\n\n154\n00:08:00.544 --> 00:08:02.311\nI can take Work and delete it.\n\n155\n00:08:02.311 --> 00:08:05.510\nLeave Automatic alone,\nyou don't wanna mess with Automatic.\n\n156\n00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.544\nAnd when I say that I'm done, now I've\nonly got the Automatic location and\n\n157\n00:08:09.544 --> 00:08:10.980\nthat's it.\n\n158\n00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:11.580\nAnd when I apply that,\n\n159\n00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.830\nI can go to my Apple menu and,\nshoot it's going to stay there.\n\n160\n00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.265\nThere it goes.\n\n161\n00:08:17.265 --> 00:08:19.665\nYou probably noticed that the location\nmenu was still there for a second.\n\n162\n00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.005\nIt takes a minute for it to go away.\n\n163\n00:08:21.005 --> 00:08:22.115\nAnd there, it's gone now.\n\n164\n00:08:22.115 --> 00:08:25.515\nSo location menu is gone,\nI know that I've only got one location.\n\n165\n00:08:25.515 --> 00:08:27.395\nSo, now when I go to edit\nthat network adapter,\n\n166\n00:08:27.395 --> 00:08:31.240\nI know that I'm looking at the single\nconfiguration for that adapter.\n\n167\n00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.405\nAnd I don't have more than one.\n\n168\n00:08:32.405 --> 00:08:34.730\nAll right, so that's one of\nthe first things that I look at.\n\n169\n00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.780\nWhen somebody's got network\nconnectivity issues,\n\n170\n00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.370\nI always double check to see\nif they have a location.\n\n171\n00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.290\nJust a super easy to check,\ntakes a second.\n\n172\n00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:41.900\nLook under the Apple menu and\nyou'll see it.\n\n173\n00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.210\nAll right, so\nthat's one thing to look for.\n\n174\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.580\nAnother thing are VPN's, right?\n\n175\n00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.800\nVPN, Virtual Private Networks.\n\n176\n00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.120\nWith VPN you build an encrypted tunnel\nbetween you and somewhere else.\n\n177\n00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.810\nNow, I use VPN's every single day.\n\n178\n00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.540\nWhen I go home at the end of the day,\nI still do work.\n\n179\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.150\nI still wanna connect to\nthe network here at the office.\n\n180\n00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.640\nBut I don't have a direct point to\npoint connection between my house and\n\n181\n00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.730\nthe office that's really,\nreally expensive.\n\n182\n00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.650\nSo instead I use the internet, but the\ninternet is not a trusting network, right?\n\n183\n00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.530\nIt's a network full of\npeople that I don't know and\n\n184\n00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.990\nsome of those people do bad things.\n\n185\n00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.820\nI don't want them to see my data, so\n\n186\n00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.120\nI built an encrypted tunnel between\nmy computer at home and the office.\n\n187\n00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.230\nThose are VPNs, Virtual Private Networks.\n\n188\n00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.750\nAnd Mac OS has VPN support\nbuilt right into it.\n\n189\n00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.220\nAnd for the most part, there's not\na whole lot to troubleshoot with a VPN.\n\n190\n00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.290\nYou just plug in the settings that are\ngiven to you by the network administrator.\n\n191\n00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:40.181\nSo whoever set up your VPN server, the\ndevice that you connect to it, it might\n\n192\n00:09:40.181 --> 00:09:44.570\nbe a firewall, it might be a dedicated VPN\nservice called the VPN concentrator, it\n\n193\n00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.450\nmight be a dedicated device like that, but\nwhoever set that up will give you a set\n\n194\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:53.220\nof information, the information consists\nof usually user name and the password.\n\n195\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.710\nIt might also have a group name and\na group password,\n\n196\n00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.060\nyou might see two sets of authentication.\n\n197\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.720\nThere may also be a, well, there will be\na server IP address you have to talk to.\n\n198\n00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.770\nThere maybe encryption\nprotocols you have to define.\n\n199\n00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.150\nThere's also the little\nthings you have to configure.\n\n200\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.870\nIf any one of them is wrong,\nthe VPN tunnel doesn't work.\n\n201\n00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.800\nNow if you've never set up VPN tunnels,\n\n202\n00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.880\nthey're done right here\nin the same screen.\n\n203\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.960\nWhen we come into our network connections,\nwhat you normally see are just your\n\n204\n00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.360\nphysical adapters, so\nyou might see your WiFi connection,\n\n205\n00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.730\nyou might see a Thunderbolt Ethernet\nadapter plugged in, and so on.\n\n206\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.620\nThe real connectors.\n\n207\n00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.400\nBut there can be virtual\nconnectors in here too.\n\n208\n00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.730\nI think I showed you that on my laptop,\nI've got more than I need.\n\n209\n00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:36.570\nDown here at the bottom, you can hit the\nplus sign and that's where you can add in\n\n210\n00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.610\nphysical adapters which may or\nmay not exist and virtual adapters.\n\n211\n00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.680\nAnd notice the virtual adapter there, VPN.\n\n212\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:48.980\nSo I can add a VPN connection in, and so\nI might call this the ITProTV Studio VPN.\n\n213\n00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.500\nJust give it a name,\nso I can recognize it.\n\n214\n00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.740\nAnd then in the box right above it,\nit's asking me what type of VPN it is.\n\n215\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.170\nAll right, IKEv2 is the default.\n\n216\n00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.460\nAnd that stands for\nInner-Network Key Exchange version two.\n\n217\n00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.270\nAnd IKEv2 is probably one of the most\ncommon VPN's that are out there.\n\n218\n00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:08.650\nIt uses a protocol suite called IPSec to\nprovide authentication and encryption.\n\n219\n00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.960\nIt's really good stuff and it's compatible\nwith a ton of systems that are out there.\n\n220\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.580\nBut, not everybody does that.\n\n221\n00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.000\nYou'll see that Cisco,\nCisco's a big networking company.\n\n222\n00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.140\nThey have their own version\nof IPSec that they use,\n\n223\n00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.960\nwhich is not directly compatible\nwith IKE version two.\n\n224\n00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.580\nSo I can choose Cisco if I want,\nall right?\n\n225\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.410\nOr I can choose PPTP, that's\nthe Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol.\n\n226\n00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.420\nPPTP is the most compatible\nwith everything, but\n\n227\n00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.140\nit uses 40 bit encryption by default,\nwhich is really, really weak.\n\n228\n00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.280\nSo it can be broken.\n\n229\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.783\nIt's not the strongest of protocols,\nso most people don't like it.\n\n230\n00:11:42.783 --> 00:11:47.337\nL2TP over IPSec, that's the layer\nto tunneling protocol being\n\n231\n00:11:47.337 --> 00:11:51.490\nused on top of IPSec,\nthat one is mostly Microsoft.\n\n232\n00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.400\nSo if you are connecting\nto Microsoft servers and\n\n233\n00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.250\nMicrosoft networks,\nyou'll use that L2TP over IPSec.\n\n234\n00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.040\nIt's a great protocol.\n\n235\n00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.050\nIt's very strong.\n\n236\n00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.090\nIt's just not very compatible, right?\n\n237\n00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.940\nI can't set up a Mac L2TP server.\n\n238\n00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.950\nI can't set up a Cisco L2TP server, they\ncan be clients, but they can't be servers.\n\n239\n00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.010\nSo I have to have a Windows server,\nsomewhere powering that.\n\n240\n00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.750\nThere are some third parties\nthat have started to do it.\n\n241\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.180\nThey've licensed that technology.\n\n242\n00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.520\nBut you don't see it as much.\n\n243\n00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.180\nIKE version two is what you normally see.\n\n244\n00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.020\nIt's an open standard.\n\n245\n00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.198\nAnybody can support it.\n\n246\n00:12:17.198 --> 00:12:18.380\nAnd so, they all do.\n\n247\n00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.550\nThis is the one that we'll\nnormally see out there.\n\n248\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.880\nAll right, now they're not asking me for\na lot of details here, are they?\n\n249\n00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.540\nJust a name and what kind of VPN it is.\n\n250\n00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:32.300\nSo I might define this one, I'll just call\nit IKEv2 VPN, and I'll create that one.\n\n251\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.100\nAnd I'm gonna create another one.\n\n252\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.790\nSo let me just add in one more.\n\n253\n00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.430\nAnd this one, I'll call it a Cisco, right?\n\n254\n00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.480\nSo this one I'm gonna\nchoose the Cisco IPSec, and\n\n255\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.012\nI'll just call it a Cisco IPSec VPN.\n\n256\n00:12:46.012 --> 00:12:53.295\nAll right, so I have two VPN's\ncreated IKE version two and Cisco.\n\n257\n00:12:53.295 --> 00:12:57.407\nNow when I choose IKEv2, over here you'll\nsee some information that provide.\n\n258\n00:12:57.407 --> 00:12:59.058\nI have to have a server address.\n\n259\n00:12:59.058 --> 00:13:01.442\nThat's the IP address of\nthe server that I'm gonna talk to.\n\n260\n00:13:01.442 --> 00:13:06.056\nAnd it needs to be a public address,\na real Internet accessible address.\n\n261\n00:13:06.056 --> 00:13:07.892\nThis is the VPN server.\n\n262\n00:13:07.892 --> 00:13:10.412\nThen, a remote ID and a local ID.\n\n263\n00:13:10.412 --> 00:13:12.646\nAnd what these normally are?\n\n264\n00:13:12.646 --> 00:13:14.276\nAre the networks that\nyou're gonna be using.\n\n265\n00:13:14.276 --> 00:13:19.876\nSo for example, my server address,\nlet's say it's one of our addresses here.\n\n266\n00:13:19.876 --> 00:13:20.406\nThat's our router.\n\n267\n00:13:20.406 --> 00:13:21.656\nWe don't actually have a VPN on it.\n\n268\n00:13:21.656 --> 00:13:22.746\nI'm just gonna point to it.\n\n269\n00:13:22.746 --> 00:13:24.056\nSo that's the server\nthat I'm gonna point to.\n\n270\n00:13:24.056 --> 00:13:25.466\nIt's a real public IP.\n\n271\n00:13:26.526 --> 00:13:28.346\nAnd then, my remote ID.\n\n272\n00:13:28.346 --> 00:13:31.336\nThat would be the network\nhere in the studio, and\n\n273\n00:13:31.336 --> 00:13:37.870\nthe studio we use 10.1.230.0/24, to 24-bit\nsubnet, that's the network that we use.\n\n274\n00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.870\nAnd then, my local ID from my laptop\nis usually gonna be the network that\n\n275\n00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:42.960\nwe're on here.\n\n276\n00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.930\nBut since this is just my machine,\n\n277\n00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.800\nI might have a single IP address that\nI use, and so I can punch that in.\n\n278\n00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.520\nOr I might even have a name that\nthe network admins have assigned me, and\n\n279\n00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.078\nI would put in that name here.\n\n280\n00:13:54.078 --> 00:13:56.987\nSo there are several different things\nthat can go in this field, but\n\n281\n00:13:56.987 --> 00:13:58.580\na lot of times it is your own network.\n\n282\n00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:04.610\nSo maybe I've got a network like that that\nand I want to provide and put in there.\n\n283\n00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.700\nOn tunnel networks,\nwe normally see it this way.\n\n284\n00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.720\nOn point to point like this one,\nit might just be my individual IP.\n\n285\n00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.700\nAnd so I'll put that in.\n\n286\n00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.130\nAnd that's the IP that I'm using or\nwhatever my laptop happens to have.\n\n287\n00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.790\nNow, that's enough to get me\nto find the server to see it.\n\n288\n00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.700\nBut to actually connect, I've got to\nauthenticate and it's gonna prompt me for\n\n289\n00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.230\nauthentication credentials.\n\n290\n00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.840\nIf I click on authentication\nsettings here, I can tweak it.\n\n291\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.690\nAnd I can provide a user name and\na password.\n\n292\n00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.260\nThat's one way to authenticate.\n\n293\n00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:36.070\nWith IP SEC, username and passwords is\nwhat's called the Pre Shared Key or PSK.\n\n294\n00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.200\nSomebody's given me\na password ahead of time.\n\n295\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.950\nBut if I dropped that down,\nI can choose certificate.\n\n296\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.620\nThey might've given me\nan X.509 certificate.\n\n297\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.260\nWhich is kind of like, well,\n\n298\n00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.530\nit's what we use for 802.1x that we\ntalked about in the last episode.\n\n299\n00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.880\nAnd that certificate identifies\nme specifically, and\n\n300\n00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.161\nit's not something that can be brute\nforced, like Like a password can.\n\n301\n00:14:54.161 --> 00:14:57.075\nSo it's much more secure,\nI will just to browse and\n\n302\n00:14:57.075 --> 00:14:59.485\nfind that certificate\nfile that I was given.\n\n303\n00:14:59.485 --> 00:15:03.362\nAnd once I've got that put in, now I can\nauthenticate or if I had a user name and\n\n304\n00:15:03.362 --> 00:15:07.122\na password I would just punch in whatever\nthat username and password was and\n\n305\n00:15:07.122 --> 00:15:09.170\nI would punch those in here, all right.\n\n306\n00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:13.480\nOnce those are set, now it's in place and\nI'm ready to connect.\n\n307\n00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.920\nNow one feature I like to turn on is\nthe Show VPN status in the menu bar,\n\n308\n00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.960\nbecause that way you can see right here,\n\n309\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.410\nthis little icon let's you know\nif you're connected or not.\n\n310\n00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:26.490\nThere's nothing I hate worst than thinking\nI'm on a secure network, when I'm not.\n\n311\n00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.060\nSo I go to a hotel somewhere and\nI VPN into the office and\n\n312\n00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.820\nit fails to connect my own notice.\n\n313\n00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.380\nAnd so, the icon is grey here.\n\n314\n00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.530\nI can see it right away.\n\n315\n00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:34.130\nI'm not connected.\n\n316\n00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.460\nI'm not secured.\n\n317\n00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.840\nIf it's connected, it lights up green.\n\n318\n00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.080\nSo I know that I am connected.\n\n319\n00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.020\nI am secured.\n\n320\n00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.910\nSo you want to be able\nto tell that difference.\n\n321\n00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.660\nThe other thing is just convenient,\ncuz I can click right here and\n\n322\n00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.580\nI can connect to a VPN once it's defined.\n\n323\n00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.990\nI haven't hit apply yet,\nso let me hit apply.\n\n324\n00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.590\nSo now that I've hit apply, oops,\nit didn't look like one of my settings.\n\n325\n00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.420\nProbably the fact that I\nleft the Cisco in blank.\n\n326\n00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.727\nYeah, I left the Cisco in blank,\nso it deleted it for me.\n\n327\n00:15:56.727 --> 00:15:57.960\nBut the IKE one was filled out.\n\n328\n00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.773\nSo now, when I click up here,\nsee how I can connect to that IKE VPN.\n\n329\n00:16:00.773 --> 00:16:03.032\nIt's super easy to get connected to it.\n\n330\n00:16:03.032 --> 00:16:07.500\nAnd be up and running, I don't have to go\ninto my system preferences to connect.\n\n331\n00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.510\nNow on the Cisco one,\nyou'll see that it's largely the same.\n\n332\n00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.330\nLet me recreate it.\n\n333\n00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.010\nBut it's got some slightly\ndifferent settings in it.\n\n334\n00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.510\nBecause well, Cisco doesn't follow up\nthe standard, they created their own\n\n335\n00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.070\nproprietary connectivity and so\nit's a little bit different.\n\n336\n00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.480\nWhen you go to set it up,\nnotice how I have a server address, so\n\n337\n00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:34.030\nI would punch in that server address and\nthen an account name and a password.\n\n338\n00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.280\nWell, that's like a username and\na password.\n\n339\n00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:36.910\nWell, not really.\n\n340\n00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.160\nIn the Cisco world, they call this\na group name and a group password.\n\n341\n00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.620\nThis is one that's gonna be\nshared across all the employees.\n\n342\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:47.240\nAnybody who wants to connect to the VPN\nis gonna connect with a account.\n\n343\n00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.300\nSo it'll be like your VPN group name and\n\n344\n00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.900\nthen whatever that password\nhappens to be for the group.\n\n345\n00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.590\nBut that's just to get connected for\nthe VPN, you still to authenticate for\n\n346\n00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:58.070\nyou as a user.\n\n347\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:04.540\nAnd so under Authentication Settings,\nI'll see where I still have more data.\n\n348\n00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.320\nAnd actually you know\nwhat I got it backwards,\n\n349\n00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.300\nthat is my username and password.\n\n350\n00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.450\nHere's the Group Name right here and\nthe shared secret.\n\n351\n00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.390\nSo my group name and password will\nactually be here, sorry guys,\n\n352\n00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.380\nI got it kinda backwards,\nso let me fix that.\n\n353\n00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.450\nSo this should be my group name and\nwhatever that password was or certificate.\n\n354\n00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.290\nAnd I would punch that in here and\n\n355\n00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:24.630\nthen back out here I would put\nin my username and password.\n\n356\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.100\nThere we go.\nA little bit different on this one.\n\n357\n00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.470\nAnd then once we got that set,\n\n358\n00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.670\nnow it's got all the information\nthat you need to connect.\n\n359\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:35.390\nBut the key thing I want to drive through\nhere is for a troubleshooting standpoint,\n\n360\n00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.750\nif any one of those settings is wrong,\nit's not gonna connect, it's gonna fail.\n\n361\n00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.060\nIt's gonna fail to connect and\npeople won't be able to VPN in.\n\n362\n00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:48.760\nNow, I'm in my office right now,\nI can't VPN to the office from my office.\n\n363\n00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.790\nAnd so it's gonna fail for\nme no matter what.\n\n364\n00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:55.250\nBut if I'm out in the field,\nif I'm at home, if I'm at a hotel, and\n\n365\n00:17:55.250 --> 00:18:00.050\nI try to VPN in, any one of these settings\nbeing wrong could cause it to fail.\n\n366\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:04.140\nBut also being filtered on\nthe network can cause it to fail.\n\n367\n00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.510\nThere are plenty of hotels and\nconference centers that block VPNs.\n\n368\n00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.740\nAnd the reason they do it is because\n\n369\n00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.060\nthey usually want to block\nhigh bandwidth things.\n\n370\n00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.400\nThey don't want to allow Netflix or\nvideo streaming.\n\n371\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.410\nBut if you build a VPN all\nyour data's encrypted,\n\n372\n00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.040\nthey don't know what you're doing anymore.\n\n373\n00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.960\nThey don't know if you're\nwatching Netflix, and so\n\n374\n00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.760\nthey can't block that traffic.\n\n375\n00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.740\nAnd so that's why they block VPN so\nthey'll always have that visibility.\n\n376\n00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.410\nIt's not necessarily the best practice but\nplenty of them do it.\n\n377\n00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.880\nBut what you'll see is when you go to\nconnect, you get good error reporting.\n\n378\n00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.620\nIf I try and connect to this IKE VPN,\nit's gonna try to connect and\n\n379\n00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.530\nit failed pretty quickly there.\n\n380\n00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:43.140\nIf I go to connect, it tries to\nconnect and then it drops out and\n\n381\n00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.060\nit fails, so it's trying to connect.\n\n382\n00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.590\nAnd if it's a bad username and a password,\nI'll get a pop-up telling me that.\n\n383\n00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.210\nBut if the server can't be reached,\nI might get something like this.\n\n384\n00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:57.610\nThe VPN server did not respond,\nverify the server address and reconnect.\n\n385\n00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.740\nSo, I need to go and\ndouble check my settings.\n\n386\n00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.430\nMake sure I've got my server name right.\n\n387\n00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.930\nMake sure I've got my usernames and\npasswords right, verify those things.\n\n388\n00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:06.099\nThat's usually the number one cause.\n\n389\n00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.590\nBut in this case,\nI can't even get to the server.\n\n390\n00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.170\nAnd the reality is cuz I'm in\nthe building so I'm not allowed to do it.\n\n391\n00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.470\nBut if I were outside, that would usually\nmean there's a firewall in between me and\n\n392\n00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.350\nthe server stopping me from connecting.\n\n393\n00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.990\nAnd so that's why we can't get there.\n\n394\n00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.650\nSo it does do pretty good reporting there.\n\n395\n00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.260\nAnd it gets logged into the console.\n\n396\n00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.160\nSo if you fire up your console app and\n\n397\n00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.620\nyou start going into your logging,\nyou'll see where it logs in here.\n\n398\n00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.660\nYou know, there's enough of my\nstuff here that's going by,\n\n399\n00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.930\nso I might not be able to spot it.\n\n400\n00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:37.420\nBut it should be logged in here that\nthe VPN tried to connect and failed.\n\n401\n00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.949\nIt'll be in your system log also I got so\n\n402\n00:19:39.949 --> 00:19:43.640\nmuch stuff scrolling by that\nI think it's already past.\n\n403\n00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.880\nBut if we scroll back in here some more we\ncan find it where it tried to connect and\n\n404\n00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.030\nit just absolutely failed.\n\n405\n00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.670\nAnd that would happen for\nmy Cisco one too,\n\n406\n00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.040\ncuz it's, well, mainly cuz we don't\nactually have a Cisco one here.\n\n407\n00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.630\nBut it's gonna try and connect,\nand that one'll fail out.\n\n408\n00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.540\nSo just be aware that VPNs,\n\n409\n00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.650\nit almost always comes down\nto configuration settings.\n\n410\n00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:00.860\nYou just have to make\nsure that's squared away.\n\n411\n00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.470\nAfter that, we're left with\nother troubleshooting tools.\n\n412\n00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.530\nSo we've talked about verifying our\nsettings, that's kind of important.\n\n413\n00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.080\nWe used the network utility\nin an earlier episode.\n\n414\n00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.420\nLet me bring the network utility back up,\nand so here's the network utility, and\n\n415\n00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:19.280\nI really just use the handful of settings,\nhandful of the tools here but\n\n416\n00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.620\nthere's actually quite a few.\n\n417\n00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.750\nSo in the show, I know I used info because\nthat's how we can identify our IP address,\n\n418\n00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.190\nour speed,\nwe can see if we're moving data.\n\n419\n00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:31.240\nReally useful way to see whether\nyour basic network is functioning.\n\n420\n00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.210\nBut the other tools go beyond that.\n\n421\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.950\nNetstat, Netstat can\nshow me my routing table.\n\n422\n00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.230\nIn other words, what networks I know\nhow to get to, and it can also show any\n\n423\n00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:44.120\ncurrent connections I have open to\nother systems out there on the network.\n\n424\n00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.630\nSo you can get this\ncomprehensive network statistic\n\n425\n00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:51.950\nanalyst of all current socket connections,\nso everybody I'm connected to.\n\n426\n00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.940\nIf I view my routing table,\nthe routing table's normally pretty small.\n\n427\n00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.740\nIt normally just says you have this\ndefault route that points to whatever\n\n428\n00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.360\nrouter's on your network.\n\n429\n00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.080\nAnd it normally comes up faster than that.\n\n430\n00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.250\nThere we go.\n\n431\n00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.850\nAnd so I can see that I've got this\ndefault gateway of 192.168.0.2, and\n\n432\n00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:09.520\nthat's where my traffic is set to go to,\nand that's it.\n\n433\n00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.570\nI don't think I have any other networks.\n\n434\n00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.930\nThe more complex your network gets,\nthe more stuff you'll have in here.\n\n435\n00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:16.620\nNotice I've got more entries for\n192.168.0.\n\n436\n00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.460\nThere is my IP, or\nactually sorry that's the router.\n\n437\n00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.290\nThat's the routers IP that I'm gonna use.\n\n438\n00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.720\nThere's my IP, and\nthen there's the broadcast for\n\n439\n00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.490\nwhen I want to send\na message to everybody.\n\n440\n00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.560\nThat's a pretty simple table.\n\n441\n00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:35.010\nIf you were to look on my laptop though,\nmy laptop is a little bit more complex.\n\n442\n00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.210\nCuz I've got something\nvirtual adaptors on here.\n\n443\n00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:41.290\nAnd so when I pull up my Netstat, it's\ngonna have a ton of different routes for\n\n444\n00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.390\nall these virtual adaptors that I've got,\nall these virtual connections.\n\n445\n00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.670\nAnd so it could be pretty complex output,\nit just depend.\n\n446\n00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.360\nBut that's what Netstat is\ndesigned to do is to show you\n\n447\n00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.150\nthis stuff is behind the scenes.\n\n448\n00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:53.685\nNow, while it's loading, let me show you\nwhat's probably the most useful thing with\n\n449\n00:21:53.685 --> 00:21:58.730\nNetstat, is you can choose display\nthe state of all current sockets.\n\n450\n00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:02.780\nAnd when you view that, it's gonna show\nevery communication that your laptop or\n\n451\n00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.310\ndesktop is doing right now.\n\n452\n00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.870\nSo, here's all the systems\nI'm connected to.\n\n453\n00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:11.920\nWell, I'm only connected to the one,\n17.110.229.209, that one.\n\n454\n00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:13.600\nWho is that?\n\n455\n00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:15.740\nTo be honest with you, I don't know.\n\n456\n00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.230\nI've no idea who the IP that is.\n\n457\n00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:21.350\nI have an open connection to\nthat foreign address right now.\n\n458\n00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.340\nIs that malware or is it malicious?\n\n459\n00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.130\nMaybe.\n\n460\n00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:25.430\nIt's probably Apple updates.\n\n461\n00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.270\nIt's probably me talking to Apple.\n\n462\n00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.030\nBut I don't know.\n\n463\n00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.190\nI don't know who that IP is.\n\n464\n00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.760\nSo I might wanna look that up and\ntry and figure it out.\n\n465\n00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.160\nSo we can do a lookup and try and\nresolve who that IP belongs to.\n\n466\n00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.630\nThere's other ones that might\nbe a little more obvious.\n\n467\n00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.160\nLike if I go up here and\nfire up a web browser and\n\n468\n00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.230\nI'm gonna go to the ITProTV website.\n\n469\n00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.340\nSo I'm going to the ITProTV website right\nnow, I'm gonna get connected to it.\n\n470\n00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.220\nAnd if I go back to netstat and\n\n471\n00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.180\nupdate this screen,\nnow I see a lot more connections.\n\n472\n00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.900\nAnd when I look in here I can see\nconnections out to an IP address\n\n473\n00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.280\nthat's resolving to\ncloudproxy.security.net.\n\n474\n00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.490\nWho is that?\n\n475\n00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.290\nWe'll that's the web firewall\nthat we used for our website.\n\n476\n00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:09.510\nSo when you go to ITProTV you actually\npassed through a firewall first and\n\n477\n00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.580\nthat's the firewall\nshowing up right there and\n\n478\n00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.330\nI've got all these different\nconnections out to that firewall\n\n479\n00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.880\nas well as connections to Amazon AWS and\na few other places.\n\n480\n00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.760\nWell, Amazon AWS is Amazon Web Services,\n\n481\n00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.070\nall of our images are served up out of\nAWS, and so you see connections there.\n\n482\n00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.800\nWhen you connect to our server,\n\n483\n00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.250\nit actually built up more than\na few different connections.\n\n484\n00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.520\nThey're all laid out here.\n\n485\n00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.790\nAnd then there's that 17 dot whatever\nagain has more connections that it did\n\n486\n00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.010\na few moments ago,\n\n487\n00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:40.200\nif I'm talking to Apple in doing updates,\nthen that must be what that is.\n\n488\n00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.460\nI think it's actually\niCloud Sync is what it is.\n\n489\n00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.420\nCuz when you fire up Safari,\nwhat does it do?\n\n490\n00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.900\nIt synchronizes its bookmarks, and\n\n491\n00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.160\nso that's more than likely\nwhat all those are.\n\n492\n00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.040\nBut we can look any of these up,\nthat's another tool in our toolbox.\n\n493\n00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.670\nWe used ping earlier just to be able to\nsee if there was another node out there.\n\n494\n00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.837\nIf I wanted to try and\nping Apple.com, for example.\n\n495\n00:23:59.837 --> 00:24:00.737\nI can run a ping and\n\n496\n00:24:00.737 --> 00:24:04.881\nsee whether I got that basic network\nconnectivity and I'm getting timeout.\n\n497\n00:24:04.881 --> 00:24:06.231\nWhy am I getting timed out on Apple?\n\n498\n00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:08.460\nLet's try ITProTV instead.\n\n499\n00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.480\nSo, some websites block pings, and so\nthey don't allow you to ping them.\n\n500\n00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.570\nThat's maybe what's going on there.\n\n501\n00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:15.729\nThere we go.\nSo I'm successfully pinging ITProTV.\n\n502\n00:24:15.729 --> 00:24:18.130\nI can get there.\n\n503\n00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.300\nIf I go to Lookup, though,\nthat's the tool I want.\n\n504\n00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.746\nWith Lookup, you can go to name and\nit will tell you the IP.\n\n505\n00:24:23.746 --> 00:24:26.318\nSo if I punch in itpro.tv and do a Lookup,\n\n506\n00:24:26.318 --> 00:24:31.240\nit's gonna resolve that against DNS and\nshow me the IP address of our server.\n\n507\n00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:31.780\nSo there it is.\n\n508\n00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.300\nAnd that's actually the IP address of\nour firewall that you pass through, but\n\n509\n00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:34.950\nthat's what you see.\n\n510\n00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:40.350\nIf I punch in an IP though, this is\nsomething that a lot of people don't know,\n\n511\n00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.500\nis you can punch in an IP and\nit'll do a reverse lookup.\n\n512\n00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.870\nAnd so it'll change IP to name,\nor at least it'll try to.\n\n513\n00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.810\nA lot of companies don't register it,\nor they do like we're doing with that\n\n514\n00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:53.750\nfirewall, and so it reverse lookups\nto the firewall and not to us.\n\n515\n00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:57.002\nSo, if I punch that in and hit Lookup,\nit's gonna look it up and yeah,\n\n516\n00:24:57.002 --> 00:24:57.840\nthat one failed.\n\n517\n00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.516\nAll right, so it failed.\n\n518\n00:24:58.516 --> 00:25:00.490\nIt couldn't find that one,\nit's not registered.\n\n519\n00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.486\nSo again, I kind of have to guess,\nwho is this?\n\n520\n00:25:03.486 --> 00:25:06.470\nWho is 17.110.229.209?\n\n521\n00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.470\nWell, it more than\nlikely belongs to Apple.\n\n522\n00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.143\nApple actually has an entire class A.\n\n523\n00:25:10.143 --> 00:25:12.170\nSo they've got a ton of addresses.\n\n524\n00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.751\nAnd I can go and research that IP and\ntry and find out who that is.\n\n525\n00:25:15.751 --> 00:25:19.180\nAnd another thing you could do is\njust fire up a web browser and\n\n526\n00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.570\npunch in the IP and see what you get.\n\n527\n00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:22.650\nAnd sometimes it'll browse and\n\n528\n00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.530\nyou'll find a website or\nsomething that's present on that one.\n\n529\n00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.860\nBut if you don't find anything,\n\n530\n00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.680\nyou can always just do a good\nold Google search for the IP and\n\n531\n00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.710\nsee if it turns up from anybody else's\nlookups, any other entries here.\n\n532\n00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.580\nAnd so when we start to look this one up,\nthese guys are doing a lookup,\n\n533\n00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.080\nand they've got it tied to Cupertino,\nCalifornia.\n\n534\n00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.770\nI can think of a few companies there,\nbut the main one being Apple, right?\n\n535\n00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:46.909\nSo that's more than likely\none of Apple's IP ranges.\n\n536\n00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.490\nAll right, so that's another good,\nwhoops, that's not what I wanted,\n\n537\n00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.060\ngood trouble shooting tool for\nus that we can do lookups there.\n\n538\n00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.120\nNet's that reveal\nthe connections that we had and\n\n539\n00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.390\nthen we can use Lookup\nto try to find them.\n\n540\n00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.602\nAnother good one is Traceroute.\n\n541\n00:26:00.602 --> 00:26:03.230\nWhat Traceroute does is when\nI connect to a website,\n\n542\n00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:07.250\nlike when I connect to the ITProTV\nwebsite, I have to pass to a series of\n\n543\n00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:11.640\nrouters to get there, Traceroute\nwill show me all of those routers.\n\n544\n00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.580\nIt'll show me every device I've\npassed through on my way out there.\n\n545\n00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.902\nUnfortunately, a lot of people\nblocked these are firewalls, and so\n\n546\n00:26:17.902 --> 00:26:19.633\nI'm gonna see if this gets\ntrunked off right here.\n\n547\n00:26:19.633 --> 00:26:23.340\nLet me switch over to my machine cuz I'll\nbe able to show you a better one here.\n\n548\n00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.430\nI should be authorized to get to it,\nso if I trace it, there we go.\n\n549\n00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.460\nSo, it's running through and\ndoing that trace, and\n\n550\n00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.570\nit's showing all the routers I\nhave to pass through to get there.\n\n551\n00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.510\nSo we pass through our service provider,\nGRU.\n\n552\n00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.730\nSo it's GRU all the way over to here.\n\n553\n00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.922\nAnd then they hand us off to gtt.net.\n\n554\n00:26:37.922 --> 00:26:42.710\nAnd then from there, I hit the cloudproxy,\nthe firewall, and the ITProTV website.\n\n555\n00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.680\nThese are all systems I passed through.\n\n556\n00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.830\nIn addition to showing me the systems,\nit shows me their performance,\n\n557\n00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:54.520\nthe Maximum speed,\nthe minimum speed, and the average.\n\n558\n00:26:54.520 --> 00:27:01.470\nSo, at this particular hop, the worst\nsignal I got took 0.8 milliseconds right?\n\n559\n00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.020\nSo almost a full millisecond.\n\n560\n00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:08.161\nThe best one I got was 0.459.\n\n561\n00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:09.998\nSo the average is 0.58.\n\n562\n00:27:09.998 --> 00:27:14.157\nYou can use this information to figure out\nwhere the bottleneck is in your network.\n\n563\n00:27:14.157 --> 00:27:15.112\nWhere do things get slow?\n\n564\n00:27:15.112 --> 00:27:17.295\nSee here, I've got like 0.33.\n\n565\n00:27:17.295 --> 00:27:20.917\nAnd then 0.459 and then 1.394.\n\n566\n00:27:20.917 --> 00:27:22.600\nThat's a huge jump.\n\n567\n00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.221\nAnd then as we go on, we get these 1.3,\nand then it jumps to 10.17.\n\n568\n00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:28.400\nThen it jumps to 29.2.\n\n569\n00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.410\nThat's a huge jump between these two hops,\nright?\n\n570\n00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:37.010\nSo when we hand it off from one gtt\nserver to another, that was a bottleneck.\n\n571\n00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:38.501\nThat's not my ISP.\n\n572\n00:27:38.501 --> 00:27:40.637\nMy service provider is GRU, up here.\n\n573\n00:27:40.637 --> 00:27:44.850\nThis is a handoff from gtt to gtt,\nwhy the big jump?\n\n574\n00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.230\nWell look at what happened.\n\n575\n00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.950\nWe went from Miami Florida to Washington.\n\n576\n00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:54.557\nWe crossed the entire United States to\nget over to the West Coast somewhere, and\n\n577\n00:27:54.557 --> 00:27:55.960\nthat's a huge jump.\n\n578\n00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.570\nAnd that's why there was that big delay.\n\n579\n00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:01.469\nNow I'm complaining about a delay\nthat's measured in milliseconds, right?\n\n580\n00:28:01.469 --> 00:28:03.920\n11 milliseconds, is that a big deal?\n\n581\n00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.810\nTo me as a human, no.\n\n582\n00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:05.630\nI don't care.\n\n583\n00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:08.836\nBut to a computer, that's a long time.\n\n584\n00:28:08.836 --> 00:28:09.950\nAll right, some of the other things.\n\n585\n00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:11.240\nYou've got a Whois lookup.\n\n586\n00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.120\nSo you can punch in a domain and\nWhois lookups will show you who owns it,\n\n587\n00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.520\nwho it's registered to.\n\n588\n00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.890\nSo I can come in and I can do that lookup.\n\n589\n00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:19.560\nI'm gonna lookup Apple.com.\n\n590\n00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:24.150\nAnd so when I go into Apple.com it's\ngonna show me who that's registered to,\n\n591\n00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.820\nand it's actually turning\nup more than one lookup.\n\n592\n00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.150\nThat's the one I wanted right there.\n\n593\n00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:34.130\nAnd as we look down it'll start to show\nus just some basic terms of use here.\n\n594\n00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:35.760\nLet's see.\n\n595\n00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.760\nWe need to be a little more\nspecific it's telling me.\n\n596\n00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:42.630\nSo I need to add = to the beginning\n\n597\n00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.470\nto get a little more specific\nas we we'll try that again.\n\n598\n00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:45.180\nThere we go.\n\n599\n00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.940\nSo here we get Apple's, and\nit's showing me who it's registered to.\n\n600\n00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.550\nAnd they've registered it\nthrough another company.\n\n601\n00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:54.800\nSo it's showing this other corporation\nthat's holding that domain name, but\n\n602\n00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.040\nat the end of the day it looks\nlike it's registered through,\n\n603\n00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.600\nI don't know GoDaddy's\nthe Whois Server I use.\n\n604\n00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.847\nIt's registered, no it is,\nit's registered through GoDaddy.\n\n605\n00:29:01.847 --> 00:29:04.650\nSo apparently Apple registered\ntheir domain through GoDaddy.\n\n606\n00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:05.620\nI didn't know that.\n\n607\n00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.740\nGoDaddy's kinda like the bargain\nbin of domain registration.\n\n608\n00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.571\nApparently, Apple likes to\nsave a buck once in a while.\n\n609\n00:29:10.571 --> 00:29:12.440\n[LAUGH] So they've got that one.\n\n610\n00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.810\nIf we're to punch in something like\namazon.com and look that one up,\n\n611\n00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.150\nwe'll see that and\nwho they're registered through.\n\n612\n00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.829\nAnd it looks like they're\nregistered through COREHUB S.R.L.,\n\n613\n00:29:20.829 --> 00:29:22.005\nI'm not familiar with them.\n\n614\n00:29:22.005 --> 00:29:24.550\nBut you've got that basic\ninformation right there.\n\n615\n00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:28.825\nSo you can see who it's registered to and\nwho owns what.\n\n616\n00:29:28.825 --> 00:29:30.288\nSo that's one tool.\n\n617\n00:29:30.288 --> 00:29:33.075\nThe Finger tool is one\nthat is pretty useless.\n\n618\n00:29:33.075 --> 00:29:34.895\nI don't know why they\nstill include it here.\n\n619\n00:29:34.895 --> 00:29:36.405\nThe Finger utility,\n\n620\n00:29:36.405 --> 00:29:38.875\nit used to be really cool back in\nthe early days of the Internet, right?\n\n621\n00:29:38.875 --> 00:29:42.031\nSo, when I got my first Internet account,\nit was through a local ISP.\n\n622\n00:29:42.031 --> 00:29:45.535\nYou dialed up, and you got a UNIX shell,\nand that was your Internet access.\n\n623\n00:29:45.535 --> 00:29:48.545\nAnd if I sent an email to somebody,\nyou've probably done this, right?\n\n624\n00:29:48.545 --> 00:29:49.575\nYou send an email to somebody, and\n\n625\n00:29:49.575 --> 00:29:53.180\nyou're, like, I wonder if they've\nread my email, have they read it?\n\n626\n00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.166\nAre they ignoring me?\n\n627\n00:29:54.166 --> 00:29:54.866\nI sent them an email.\n\n628\n00:29:54.866 --> 00:29:57.500\nIt's been like ten minutes,\nthey haven't replied what going on?\n\n629\n00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.580\nWell, back in the day it would take people\ndays to reply to emails anyway cuz you're\n\n630\n00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.408\nnot always connected.\n\n631\n00:30:01.408 --> 00:30:03.953\nSo, you had this tool called Finger.\n\n632\n00:30:03.953 --> 00:30:05.613\nAnd what you can do is\nyou could type finger and\n\n633\n00:30:05.613 --> 00:30:07.021\npunch in somebody's email address.\n\n634\n00:30:07.021 --> 00:30:09.056\nAnd it would reach out to that server and\nit would say, hey,\n\n635\n00:30:09.056 --> 00:30:10.739\ncould you tell me a little\nbit about that person?\n\n636\n00:30:10.739 --> 00:30:15.533\nAnd the server would respond with\nhow many unread email they had and\n\n637\n00:30:15.533 --> 00:30:18.500\nthe last time they logged in.\n\n638\n00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.970\nAnd so I could reach out, and\nI sent somebody an email, so\n\n639\n00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:24.220\nI could see that they had one unread email\nand they hadn't logged in in two days.\n\n640\n00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.300\nAnd I would say, all right, well,\nthey haven't read my email.\n\n641\n00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.980\nSo it was a neat tool, but\nobviously it's kinda a privacy weakness.\n\n642\n00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.630\nIt's looking into somebody\nelse's mailbox and\n\n643\n00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.620\nit's giving information about\nthe last time they logged in.\n\n644\n00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.040\nSo Finger doesn't really work anymore.\n\n645\n00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.760\nIf I punch in don@itpro.tv and I try and\n\n646\n00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.450\nrun the Finger utility against that,\nit's just gonna fail.\n\n647\n00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.050\nNobody runs Finger on\ntheir servers anymore.\n\n648\n00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.460\nSo this is kinda a dead utility but\nApple still includes it for,\n\n649\n00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.740\nI don't know, posterity or something.\n\n650\n00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.780\nSo yeah, [LAUGH] failed to connect,\nkind of expect that.\n\n651\n00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:58.570\nThe last utility is the most useful for\ntroubleshooting firewall problems.\n\n652\n00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.060\nRemember I mentioned the firewall,\nand how I said if you try and\n\n653\n00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.970\nbuild a VPN connection up, the VPN\nconnection might fail because there might\n\n654\n00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.070\nbe a firewall in between you and\nthe destination.\n\n655\n00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.966\nYou can use a Port Scan\nto figure that out.\n\n656\n00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:11.490\nIf you try and\nconnect to a host on a particular port and\n\n657\n00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.010\nit gets blocked you'll see it right here.\n\n658\n00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:17.246\nSo, if I try and\nconnect to something, right?\n\n659\n00:31:17.246 --> 00:31:23.183\nLike if I wanna do a scan of, let me think\nof a device here in the building with me.\n\n660\n00:31:23.183 --> 00:31:25.200\nI think I've got like a network\nappliance that I can scan.\n\n661\n00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.830\nLet's do this one.\n\n662\n00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.758\nSo, this is a network-attached\nstorage appliance that's here\n\n663\n00:31:29.758 --> 00:31:30.980\nin the building with me.\n\n664\n00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.160\nI can scan it and test the ports.\n\n665\n00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.130\nCan I connect on these ports?\n\n666\n00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.511\nIf I'm trying to connect\nto its web server and\n\n667\n00:31:38.511 --> 00:31:42.146\nI know it's running a web server on\nport 80, I could come in here and\n\n668\n00:31:42.146 --> 00:31:45.112\njust test port 80 and say,\ncan I connect on port 80?\n\n669\n00:31:45.112 --> 00:31:48.100\nAnd I'll run a scan, and\nsure enough, I can connect.\n\n670\n00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.627\nIf I can't connect that means there's\nprobably a firewall blocking me.\n\n671\n00:31:51.627 --> 00:31:54.175\nOr maybe I just have network\nconnectivity issues in general, but\n\n672\n00:31:54.175 --> 00:31:55.252\nusually it's a firewall.\n\n673\n00:31:55.252 --> 00:31:56.413\nWell what about SSL?\n\n674\n00:31:56.413 --> 00:31:59.876\nI can switch that to 443 and I can test.\n\n675\n00:31:59.876 --> 00:32:01.435\nAnd I can connect on 443.\n\n676\n00:32:01.435 --> 00:32:04.538\nSo it's a great way to test whether you\ncan connect on individual ports and\n\n677\n00:32:04.538 --> 00:32:06.590\nto rule out a firewall being an issue.\n\n678\n00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:11.800\nAnd you can scan ranges of ports to\nsee what services a device is running.\n\n679\n00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.290\nSo when I start to scan it, I can see that\nnetwork attached to ours is running FTP,\n\n680\n00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:21.300\nit's running SSH, it's running SMB, Server\nMessage Block, from Microsoft Sharing.\n\n681\n00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.100\nHTTPS, it's got 548 for\nApple file protocol, so it's got several\n\n682\n00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.830\ndifferent protocols that it's running,\nand I can see all of that on the list.\n\n683\n00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.460\nThe port scan utility is really useful.\n\n684\n00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.440\nIt's not recommended that you\nrun it against public IPs.\n\n685\n00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.980\nIf you run it against a public IP, your\ninternet service provider might think that\n\n686\n00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.730\nyou're starting to do a reconnaissance\nattack, and they might block you.\n\n687\n00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.450\nBut for internal IPs,\nyou can scan your heart's content.\n\n688\n00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.836\nAnd you can see some really good\ninformation and you can test things.\n\n689\n00:32:46.836 --> 00:32:48.550\nIf you're going to run\nit on a public network,\n\n690\n00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:50.260\nyou should always limit it to one port.\n\n691\n00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:54.090\nIf you do a range of ports, it'll look\nlike you're starting an attack, right?\n\n692\n00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:54.940\nSo that gets blocked.\n\n693\n00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.575\nBut a single port is normally fine.\n\n694\n00:32:56.575 --> 00:33:00.255\nSo I can't get to Apple's website,\nbut I can ping it.\n\n695\n00:33:00.255 --> 00:33:01.295\nWell, can I connect on port 80?\n\n696\n00:33:01.295 --> 00:33:02.275\nI could find out.\n\n697\n00:33:02.275 --> 00:33:05.715\nYou could come in here and you could say,\nI'm going to put in apple.com.\n\n698\n00:33:05.715 --> 00:33:10.155\nAnd I'm just going to try port 80 and\nwhen I scan, I can connect.\n\n699\n00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:14.650\nAnd that helps me to rule out\nthe web browser is the problem.\n\n700\n00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:18.240\nThat I am able to connect, so\nmaybe I've got some other issue.\n\n701\n00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.130\nOr not rule out, but rule in web browser.\n\n702\n00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:21.525\nWeb browser could be the problem here,\n\n703\n00:33:21.525 --> 00:33:25.390\nbecause I am able to connect\nwith a port scan, right?\n\n704\n00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:29.390\nAnd there's Apple's range, starting with\n17, so, looks like there's 17 addresses or\n\n705\n00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:30.990\nApple that was me syncing with Apple.\n\n706\n00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.690\nAll right, so\nthis is some of the common issues.\n\n707\n00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:38.380\nNow, never underestimate, or overestimate\nthe knowledge of your end user.\n\n708\n00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.190\nI don't know the best way to put that.\n\n709\n00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.850\nSometimes it can be as simple as\nhaving an unplugged network cable.\n\n710\n00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:46.310\nSo, don't go diving deep into network\nutilities, and troubleshooting, and\n\n711\n00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:49.290\nall this crazy stuff, when we just\nneed to plug a network cable in.\n\n712\n00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.670\nIt could be as simple as that.\n\n713\n00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:52.600\nIt could be a wrong password, so\n\n714\n00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.620\nalways remember the simple\nthings when troubleshooting.\n\n715\n00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.530\nBut in this episode, we got a chance\nto see a lot of the tools that\n\n716\n00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.290\nare available for us and\nthe things that we look at.\n\n717\n00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:03.660\nWe started with network locations I always\ndouble-check that one because it's an easy\n\n718\n00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.760\none to mess up.\n\n719\n00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.030\nWe talked about VPNs and\nhow they've got so\n\n720\n00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:09.170\nmany settings that they can\nall be configured wrong.\n\n721\n00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:10.940\nAnd then last time we talked\nabout the network utility and\n\n722\n00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.870\nall the different ways that we can\nuse that to troubleshoot our network.\n\n723\n00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:15.440\nSo, we've got the tools,\n\n724\n00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.000\nwe've got the techniques,\njust don't underestimate the simple stuff.\n\n725\n00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.890\nAlways check the simple stuff first\nbecause that's usually the problem.\n\n726\n00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:23.940\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed that.\n\n727\n00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.390\nThat's pretty much it for network\ntroubleshooting and really the network\n\n728\n00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:29.920\nconfiguration section as a whole, I'm sure\nmost of you guys are tired of it because\n\n729\n00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.640\nthis is part four of the episode,\nbut we will wrap it up here.\n\n730\n00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:34.418\nI do hope you enjoyed it.\n\n731\n00:34:34.418 --> 00:34:37.530\nStay tuned, because we have more\nApple Certified Support Professional\n\n732\n00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:38.930\ncoverage coming up.\n\n733\n00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:40.580\nBut for now, singing off for ITProTV.\n\n734\n00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:45.306\nI'm Don Pezet, and I'll see you next time.\n\n735\n00:34:45.306 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.981\nAll right, good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening.\n\n3\n00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:17.240\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.000\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.730\nBack again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n6\n00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.450\nAnd in this episode we are kicking\noff an all new section.\n\n7\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.280\nFor those of you watching\nthe episodes in order,\n\n8\n00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.870\nyou just slugged through four\nparts of network configuration.\n\n9\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.500\nI appreciate you making it through.\n\n10\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.460\nBut we're gonna do all new stuff now.\n\n11\n00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.670\nAnd, I shouldn't say all new because\n[LAUGH] we're doing network services.\n\n12\n00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.240\nAnd the first network service that we're\ngonna kick off with is good, old, iCloud.\n\n13\n00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.470\nAnd I know what you're thinking.\n\n14\n00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.450\nDon, we covered iCloud\nback a few episodes ago.\n\n15\n00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.160\nDo we really need to hit it again?\n\n16\n00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.260\nThe short answer is yes.\n\n17\n00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.260\nWe do need to hit it again.\n\n18\n00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.710\nThere's certain things they want\nyou to be aware of on the exam.\n\n19\n00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.710\nAnd so I want to talk about\nsome of the iCloud features.\n\n20\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.220\nAnd I want to show them in action so\n\n21\n00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.140\nwe make sure we understand\nexactly how they work.\n\n22\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.450\nAnd talk a little bit about some\ntroubleshooting especially on the Back\n\n23\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.470\nto My Mac feature, cuz that one\nalways turns up on the exam and\n\n24\n00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.790\nit's a tricky one to\nget working sometimes.\n\n25\n00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.880\nSo, we're gonna look at that and\nkinda move through on that technology, so\n\n26\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.060\nbasically revisiting good old iCloud.\n\n27\n00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.830\nNow, if you didn't watch the other\nepisodes on iCloud then we'll start from\n\n28\n00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.890\nscratch and it's kinda a neat function.\n\n29\n00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.080\nSo iCloud is Apple's big\nforay into network services,\n\n30\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.350\nand through iCloud,\nthey provide all sorts of functionality.\n\n31\n00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.430\nIt really does a lot of things.\n\n32\n00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.940\nThey started way back in the day\nwith the whole .me thing\n\n33\n00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.970\nwhere you got your own little website.\n\n34\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.120\nAnd then they started\ndoing the email service.\n\n35\n00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.380\nAnd so you could get the .me email\naccount, and then they've expanded it and\n\n36\n00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.440\nadded file storage, and so\nnow we've got iCloud storage.\n\n37\n00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.990\nAnd that iCloud storage evolved to\ninclude bookmark synchronization,\n\n38\n00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.050\napplication synchronization,\npassword and key chain sync.\n\n39\n00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.150\nWe started getting other things like\nremote security so you can lock, wipe, and\n\n40\n00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.280\nfind your machine if you lost it.\n\n41\n00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.570\niCloud has really grown to be\na powerhouse of technology.\n\n42\n00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.150\nAnd, in a lot of respects,\n\n43\n00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.360\nApple didn't anticipate it being\nas successful as it has been.\n\n44\n00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.990\nAnd so it's grown a lot\nfaster than they intended.\n\n45\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.970\nWhen they originally launched it,\n\n46\n00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.440\nthey didn't have the hardware\ninfrastructure to support it and so\n\n47\n00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.480\nthey leveraged Amazon web services and\nMicrosoft Azure, two of their competitors.\n\n48\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.400\nI guess Amazon's not a direct competitor.\n\n49\n00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.320\nBut they leveraged their infrastructure\nto be able to support iCloud.\n\n50\n00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.920\nAnd so to this day, the majority of\niCloud services run from Microsoft and\n\n51\n00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.390\nAmazon servers.\n\n52\n00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.440\nBut Apple is steadily building up their\ndata centers to take over that and\n\n53\n00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.290\nbring it all in-house because they\nknow that iCloud is here to stay.\n\n54\n00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.800\nThey've incorporated it\nInto all of their devices.\n\n55\n00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.710\nIf you have an iPhone,\niPad, iPod, MacBook,\n\n56\n00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.780\nMac Pro, iMac, Mac Mini, whatever,\nif you got any of those devices,\n\n57\n00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.770\nthey all support iCloud, and\niCloud allows you to share that data and\n\n58\n00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.600\nhave a common experience\nbetween the systems.\n\n59\n00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.180\nAll you have to do is turn it on.\n\n60\n00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.910\nOn some devices like on iOS\ndevices they push it really hard.\n\n61\n00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.720\nOn a Mac though, when you're running OS10,\nit'll push very hard at all.\n\n62\n00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.858\nDuring the initial setup when\nyou login the first time,\n\n63\n00:03:04.858 --> 00:03:08.150\nit'll ask you if you wanna sign\nin with an iCloud account.\n\n64\n00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.605\nRight, with an Apple ID.\n\n65\n00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:10.815\nAnd the Apple IDs are free.\n\n66\n00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:13.105\nYou just go to Apple's site and\nyou sign up for it and\n\n67\n00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:16.187\nnow you've got an Apple ID and\nthe accompanying iCloud services.\n\n68\n00:03:16.187 --> 00:03:18.575\nAll right, now, there are certain\nthings you get for free and\n\n69\n00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:20.335\nthere are certain things you can pay for.\n\n70\n00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:23.235\nThe free side really covers\nthe majority of the services.\n\n71\n00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:25.510\nTons of synchronization and functionality.\n\n72\n00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.290\nOn iCloud storage site, you get\na blazing five gigabytes of storage.\n\n73\n00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.410\nNow, I'm being sarcastic.\n\n74\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.120\nFive gigabytes is not a lot of storage.\n\n75\n00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.280\nIt's like one DVD.\n\n76\n00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.960\nBut, it's enough for doing the\nsynchronization that we normally expect.\n\n77\n00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.270\nAnd if you want more storage,\nyou can buy it.\n\n78\n00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.480\nYou can update and\nchoose to purchase that.\n\n79\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.540\nSo when you sign in with your Apple ID,\nyou're connecting to an iCloud account.\n\n80\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.960\nYou'll immediately get all\nthe free services, and\n\n81\n00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.770\nthen there's some options to buy things.\n\n82\n00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.238\nWell, if you didn't sign up\nduring the initial setup,\n\n83\n00:03:52.238 --> 00:03:55.410\nlet me show you the process here\non the Mac that I skipped it on.\n\n84\n00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.130\nSo this is a Mac that I've got running\nEl Capitan, its a stock install.\n\n85\n00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.290\nDuring the install and I ask for\nmy username and I give it Don Pezet,\n\n86\n00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.590\nand it asked if I wanted to sign in\nwith an Apple ID and I said no thanks.\n\n87\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.170\nAnd so I didn't sign in.\n\n88\n00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.260\nAnd then I wanted to\ninstall some applications.\n\n89\n00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.850\nAnd so for applications and updates,\nyou need to use the App Store.\n\n90\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.230\nAnd the App Store needs\nto connect your Apple ID.\n\n91\n00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.790\nWell, you can put your apple\nID into the App Store.\n\n92\n00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.760\nThat's not connecting you to iCloud.\n\n93\n00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.820\nThat's connecting you to the App Store.\n\n94\n00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.400\nIf you wanna connect to iCloud and\n\n95\n00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.710\nget that full functionality, you actually\nhave to add it as iCloud, specifically.\n\n96\n00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.840\nThere's actually four different places\nyou can log in with an Apple ID.\n\n97\n00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.710\nLet me show you each of them, right?\n\n98\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.230\nThe App Store is the first one.\n\n99\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.640\nWhen you go into the App Store,\nin your store menu up top,\n\n100\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.380\nif you can ever get into it, you'll see\n\n101\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.860\nright here where you can sign in with\nan Apple ID and I'm already signed in.\n\n102\n00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.450\nSo it's got View My Account\n(don@itpro.tv) and I can sign out.\n\n103\n00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.360\nSo I've added iCloud right there,\nall right, sort of, not really iCloud,\n\n104\n00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.480\nthat is my Apple ID.\n\n105\n00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.290\nI can do the same thing in iTunes.\n\n106\n00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.100\nYou go into iTunes,\nyou go into the store menu and\n\n107\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.860\nyou've got where you can sign in there.\n\n108\n00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.290\nSo that's your account, and that doesn't\nnecessarily sync between systems.\n\n109\n00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.250\nYou can, and\nit would just be the App Store.\n\n110\n00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.760\nYou purchase apps on one, you can install\nthem on the other, and that's it, right?\n\n111\n00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.410\nSo that's the way that\nthe App Store works.\n\n112\n00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.050\nBut it's not the full\niCloud functionality.\n\n113\n00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.390\nI can also set it so that my user account,\nif I go into my System Preferences, and\n\n114\n00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.730\nI go into Users & Groups,\nand I find my user account.\n\n115\n00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.090\nSo here's the Don Pezet Admin account\nthat was made when I installed this.\n\n116\n00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.520\nOver here, it's got where I can\nchange my password and that's it.\n\n117\n00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.210\nWhen I create a user account,\n\n118\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.810\nyou can tell the user account\nthat it needs to be an Apple ID.\n\n119\n00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.430\nAnd so when I go and add a new account,\n\n120\n00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.860\nI could have created an admin account,\ncalled it Don Pezet.\n\n121\n00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.870\nIt's not gonna let me cuz it's already\nin use, but let's just say I did it.\n\n122\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.510\nAnd then right here,\nI could say use an iCloud password.\n\n123\n00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.160\nAnd now, my actual user account on my\nMac is linked to my iCloud account,\n\n124\n00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.529\nand that ties up together and\ngives me the full iCloud functionality.\n\n125\n00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.670\nAnother place that we could add it is\nif I go back to my Internet Accounts.\n\n126\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.710\nHere in System Preferences,\n\n127\n00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.160\nif you go to Internet Accounts,\nyou've got iCloud right there.\n\n128\n00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.010\nBut when we add iCloud this way, what it's\nreally doing is adding mail, contacts,\n\n129\n00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.732\ncalendar, those basic\ncollaboration features,\n\n130\n00:06:17.732 --> 00:06:20.550\nkind of like adding an email account.\n\n131\n00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.290\nNot necessarily the full\nset of iCloud features.\n\n132\n00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.240\nSo if I want the full\nset of iCloud features,\n\n133\n00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.730\nthe best place to add it is\nthe System Preference called iCloud.\n\n134\n00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.730\nThat's the fourth place.\n\n135\n00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:31.930\nThis is the one we want.\n\n136\n00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.630\nAnd so when you're doing your\ninitial install on it and\n\n137\n00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.940\nit offers to link up with your Apple ID,\nit's really syncing up with this.\n\n138\n00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.830\nSo if you skipped it like I did, you can\njust jump right back in here and set it.\n\n139\n00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.440\nAnd so now I'm gonna come in here and\nsign in with my Apple ID.\n\n140\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.180\nIf you don't have an Apple ID, you can go\nto Apple's website and you can create one.\n\n141\n00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.866\nYou can get that account created and now\nyou'll have it available to get set up.\n\n142\n00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:56.607\nAnd then once you provide the right\npassword, which I think I know,\n\n143\n00:06:56.607 --> 00:07:00.780\nthen you can get signed in and\nit's gonna get us connected.\n\n144\n00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.680\nNow there's a few steps you\nmight have to go through.\n\n145\n00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.610\nYou might have turned on multi-factorial\nauthentication, like I have.\n\n146\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.240\nSo, when I go to sign in to my account,\nit doesn't just let me connect,\n\n147\n00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.230\nit asks me to do some second step.\n\n148\n00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.610\nIt might send me an email that\nI need to click on to confirm.\n\n149\n00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.844\nIt might send a text message to my\nphone that I need to get a code off of.\n\n150\n00:07:16.844 --> 00:07:20.775\nOr, I might just need to manually\napprove it from another device.\n\n151\n00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:22.910\nSo one of my other devices'll\nget a message that'll pop up and\n\n152\n00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.510\nI'll have to approve it.\n\n153\n00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.110\nOnce you've done that,\nyou'll be able to connect everything.\n\n154\n00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.250\nAnd by default,\nit's gonna connect the core services.\n\n155\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.590\nThis is what I talked about\nin the other episode.\n\n156\n00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.620\nMail, contacts, calendar, reminders,\n\n157\n00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.120\nnotes, Safari as far as the bookmarks,\nFind My Mac.\n\n158\n00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.780\nSo if I lose the device I can find it.\n\n159\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.590\nI can pull up where it's located.\n\n160\n00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.230\nThose are cool services.\n\n161\n00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.060\nBut there's other services\nthat are just as important\n\n162\n00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.130\nlike key chain synchronization and\nback to my Mac.\n\n163\n00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.390\nAnd those are the two that I really\nwanna focus on this episode.\n\n164\n00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.230\nKey chain and back to my Mac.\n\n165\n00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.498\nAnd those don't even show up here.\n\n166\n00:07:54.498 --> 00:07:57.818\nWhen I hit next,\nit's gonna activate these services.\n\n167\n00:07:57.818 --> 00:07:59.378\nWhat about the other two?\n\n168\n00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:02.858\nWell the other two are really sensitive\nWas thinking about what they do.\n\n169\n00:08:02.858 --> 00:08:04.338\nThe Keychain, right?\n\n170\n00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:07.800\nOn the Keychain side that's\nsynchronizing passwords.\n\n171\n00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.520\nI take all the passwords\nthat I save on one machine,\n\n172\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.900\nand I synchronize them via\nthe internet to another machine.\n\n173\n00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.960\nWhat happens if somebody\ncould get that data?\n\n174\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.530\nThey'll have all my password,\nthat's not good, right?\n\n175\n00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.390\nSo I might not want that,\nthat's why I gotta come in here and\n\n176\n00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.940\nconfigure it if I want it.\n\n177\n00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.310\nAnd back to my Mac,\nwhat does back to my Mac do?\n\n178\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.630\nIt let's me remotely access the screen on\nmy computer from anywhere in the world.\n\n179\n00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.660\nWhat if somebody got access to that?\n\n180\n00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.770\nThey could access my computer.\n\n181\n00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.530\nI don't want that.\n\n182\n00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.860\nSo again, it's another one that\nwe've gotta get turned on.\n\n183\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.220\nThe two most sensitive ones.\n\n184\n00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.458\nWe have opt in for, right?\n\n185\n00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:42.676\nAnd that make sense,\nthat's kinda what we want.\n\n186\n00:08:42.676 --> 00:08:44.128\nAll right, so here,\n\n187\n00:08:44.128 --> 00:08:48.975\nit's asking whether we're going to\nallow location services on a Mac on\n\n188\n00:08:48.975 --> 00:08:54.248\nan iPad on an iPhone you definitely have\nGPS location support inside of them.\n\n189\n00:08:54.248 --> 00:08:58.216\nOn your MacBooks and your MacPros and\ndesktops, you don't really have GPS's and\n\n190\n00:08:58.216 --> 00:09:01.727\nso on these, it leverages the wireless\nnetworks you're connected to,\n\n191\n00:09:01.727 --> 00:09:03.530\nto be able to find these things.\n\n192\n00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.220\nAnd so, she's saying,\ndo I want to allow that?\n\n193\n00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.100\nAnd I'll allow it.\n\n194\n00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:10.290\nIt's also making it where I can\nallow locking and erasing the mac.\n\n195\n00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.528\nSo I'm gonna allow that, so\nit will have that functionality.\n\n196\n00:09:12.528 --> 00:09:14.260\nAnd I am just going to hit provide.\n\n197\n00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.300\nA password.\nNow,\n\n198\n00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.640\nhere it's setting up that keychain sync.\n\n199\n00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.760\nAnd for the keychain sync to work,\n\n200\n00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.250\nit's gotta have a private key\nto encrypt all the passwords.\n\n201\n00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.680\nAnd I've gotta use this same\nprivate key on each computer or\n\n202\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.590\nthey won't be able to read those\npasswords, the database is encrypted.\n\n203\n00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.860\nThat's where we get the safety and\nprotection.\n\n204\n00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.500\nI've gotta give it that key, right here.\n\n205\n00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:38.520\nSo, what I punch in here is\ngoing to become my private key.\n\n206\n00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.340\nSo you probably don't wanna use one,\ntwo, three, four.\n\n207\n00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.560\nYou probably wanna use something\na little bit stronger, so\n\n208\n00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.280\nthat you'll have a good\nstrong base of security.\n\n209\n00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.760\nAll right, so I'm gonna punch that in, and\n\n210\n00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.850\nnow it's gonna start synchronizing that\ndata, and because I turned on one of\n\n211\n00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:56.720\nthe sensitive features,\nhere's my strong approval coming up.\n\n212\n00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.930\nI can request approval\nfrom another device.\n\n213\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.060\nSo if I have an iPhone, an iPad,\n\n214\n00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.580\nanother Mac, that signed in with my Apple\nID, I can choose request approval and\n\n215\n00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.650\nI can go to any of those other devices and\nthey'll give a little pop-up.\n\n216\n00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.770\nSaying, do I wanna approve the device?\n\n217\n00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:10.810\nSo I can approve it.\n\n218\n00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.810\nSo by having one of those second devices,\nI can prove it as me.\n\n219\n00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.950\nOr, I can prove that I stole\nmore than one device from Don.\n\n220\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.770\nSo it's not necessarily foolproof.\n\n221\n00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.720\nSo the other option is we can use a code.\n\n222\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.160\nThe iCloud security code can\neither be emailed to you or\n\n223\n00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.610\nit can be texted to you based\non how your Apple ID is set up.\n\n224\n00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.470\nWhen you configure your Apple ID,\nyou configure that option and\n\n225\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:32.980\ndetermine how it's going to be set up.\n\n226\n00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:38.270\nSo I'm gonna whip out my cellphone here\nreal quick and what you'll usually see\n\n227\n00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.870\nis one of two things, either a little\nmessage telling you, you need to unlock\n\n228\n00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.610\nyour phone to see the code and the code\nwill be right there on your screen.\n\n229\n00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:49.500\nOr, you might see a text message\ncome in that's got the code and\n\n230\n00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.900\nI'm watching my text messages here,\nit normally happens pretty quick.\n\n231\n00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.700\nSo if we give that just a moment,\nthat code should come up and we get it.\n\n232\n00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.950\nIf you don't get it, if you get impatient\nlike I'm getting right now, and\n\n233\n00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.160\ndon't want to wait for it.\n\n234\n00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.560\nYou can always come in and\nswitch to a different mode.\n\n235\n00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.410\nI can cancel and choose the one of\nthe other methods for authenticating.\n\n236\n00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.970\nThis one, you know,\nI haven't gotten my text message yet.\n\n237\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.600\nThey normally just text you a four\ndigit number, you type it in, and\n\n238\n00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.670\nyou're in business.\n\n239\n00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.660\nWhatever reason, mine hasn't come in.\n\n240\n00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.020\nI'm gonna cancel that.\n\n241\n00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.540\nAnd when I cancel it,\nsee how the Keychain deactivated?\n\n242\n00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.670\nIt didn't activate Keychain sync, because\nI wasn't able to authenticate the phone.\n\n243\n00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.910\nAnd back to my Mac is turned off.\n\n244\n00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.260\nThe two sensitive ones,\nthey're off by default.\n\n245\n00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:34.720\nI'm gonna turn Keychain back on again and\nwe'll take another stab at this.\n\n246\n00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.740\nAnd once I get this put in, and\nI'm assuming I can get it put in,\n\n247\n00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.670\nI'm gonna choose the other method for\nauthenticating.\n\n248\n00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.045\nThere we go.\nSo instead of using a code,\n\n249\n00:11:45.045 --> 00:11:47.440\ncuz I never got my code,\nI'm going to choose request approval.\n\n250\n00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.580\nAnd when I request approval,\nit's sending out a push notification.\n\n251\n00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.118\nTo my iPad, to my iPhone,\nto the other devices that I have.\n\n252\n00:11:55.118 --> 00:11:57.048\nMy iMac at home will get this message too.\n\n253\n00:11:57.048 --> 00:12:00.584\nAnd on any one of them,\nI should be able to turn on the device and\n\n254\n00:12:00.584 --> 00:12:02.420\nsee that message to approve it.\n\n255\n00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.100\nAnd then I can prove it and\ngain access to the account.\n\n256\n00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.828\nAll right, well if I would stop and\nthink about it,\n\n257\n00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:09.088\nI think I know what's going on here.\n\n258\n00:12:09.088 --> 00:12:10.960\nI have a real Apple ID and a fake one.\n\n259\n00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.190\nThis is my fake one that I use, and so my\nMy phone's not signed in with my fake one,\n\n260\n00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.440\nit's signed in with my real one, that's\nwhy I'm not getting my notification.\n\n261\n00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.780\nSo I've got a couple of options here.\n\n262\n00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.110\nOne, I could go to another device where\nI'm logged in with my fake Apple ID,\n\n263\n00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.770\nwhich is,\nI don't think I have another device.\n\n264\n00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.630\nOr two, I can override the security code,\nso let me tell you about that process.\n\n265\n00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.340\nWhen you set up keychain synchronization,\n\n266\n00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.280\nyou obviously have to provide your\nApple iD, user name, and password.\n\n267\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.178\nBut you can also provide a security code,\na four digit code.\n\n268\n00:12:36.178 --> 00:12:39.416\nAnd when you provide that code, it's kind\nof like a little recovery mechanism that\n\n269\n00:12:39.416 --> 00:12:41.140\nyou can use to authorize\nthe second factor.\n\n270\n00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.520\nSo you've got username and\npassword, and the security code.\n\n271\n00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.500\nWell, because it's my fake account,\nI don't really remember what my code was.\n\n272\n00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.340\nI might be able to guess it.\n\n273\n00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.330\nThere's only so many four digit codes\nthat I use and there's always so\n\n274\n00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.820\nmany four digit codes I could sit here and\n\n275\n00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.260\ntry 10,000 times, I'll probably get it\neventually, but I can just reset the code.\n\n276\n00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.310\nNow, when you reset the code,\nwhat happens?\n\n277\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.860\nThis is my keychain, it's really\nimportant, so it empties out the keychain.\n\n278\n00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.140\nIt dumps everything from the keychain.\n\n279\n00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.160\nYou start new and empty.\n\n280\n00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.730\nThat way if I'm an attacker,\nI don't get anything.\n\n281\n00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.369\nBut I'm a legitimate user,\nI can just rebuild the keychain and go,\n\n282\n00:13:12.369 --> 00:13:15.118\nall of the passwords I enter from now\non will be synced and put on there.\n\n283\n00:13:15.118 --> 00:13:17.210\nSo that's what I'm doing,\nI'm gonna reset mine.\n\n284\n00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.790\nSo on my screen here, when I get to that\nenter your iCloud security code screen,\n\n285\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.970\nyou'll see where its got\na little Forgot Code button.\n\n286\n00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.580\nAnd if you hit Forgot Code,\nit's gonna offer to say,\n\n287\n00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.740\nwell, you could just use another device.\n\n288\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.690\nHit Use Other Device.\n\n289\n00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.150\nAnd the other device can give us approval.\n\n290\n00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.120\nWe don't have to know our code.\n\n291\n00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.540\nOr if it's lost and\n\n292\n00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:38.020\nI don't have another device like I don't,\nI can reset my keychain.\n\n293\n00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:42.780\nAnd when you reset it, it's gonna empty\nout the keychain on your computer.\n\n294\n00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.260\nAnd it's gonna reset it in iCloud.\n\n295\n00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.500\nSo I'm erasing my Keychain in iCloud,\n\n296\n00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.980\nall those passwords are now gone, and\nnow I can put in a new security code.\n\n297\n00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.410\nNow notice the security\ncode is six digits now.\n\n298\n00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.870\nIn the default install, it's four digits\ncuz we used to use four digit codes and\n\n299\n00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.250\nApple updated to a newer\nstandard with six digits, so\n\n300\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.830\nnew codes will be six, old will be four.\n\n301\n00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.480\nHence, now I can come in and\nI can punch in a six digit code.\n\n302\n00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.460\nThat only I remember.\n\n303\n00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.430\nWell, I say I remember it, but\nyou saw how well that worked out.\n\n304\n00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.200\nAnd I can move forward,\n\n305\n00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.670\nand it's gonna make me type it in again to\nmake sure that I actually do remember it.\n\n306\n00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.670\nAnd I can punch in a cell\nphone number to say,\n\n307\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.920\nif I ever wanna get this code by text,\nwhich is what I was waiting on a moment\n\n308\n00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.340\nago, I can punch that phone\nnumber in right here, okay?\n\n309\n00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.910\nNow I don't know.\n\n310\n00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.370\nI'll just put in the office phone number,\nso\n\n311\n00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.907\nI don't want to put in my cell\nphone here on Internet tv.\n\n312\n00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:36.830\n[LAUGH] So I'll put in our office number.\n\n313\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.500\nSo now, I'll get that verification.\n\n314\n00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.340\niCloud Keychain has been reset and\n\n315\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.130\nfrom now on passwords that I create\nwill get stored in the keychain.\n\n316\n00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.680\nThe other feature was back to\nmy Mac that I want to turn on,\n\n317\n00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.550\nbut let's just deal with the keychain for\nright now.\n\n318\n00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.180\nWe'll deal with back\nto my Mac in a second.\n\n319\n00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.260\nAll right, so\nthis system is now logged in to iCloud.\n\n320\n00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.690\nSo I've got iCloud storage.\n\n321\n00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.410\nI've got Safari bookmark sync.\n\n322\n00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.440\nI've got email.\n\n323\n00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.380\nYou see all the services\nright here in the list.\n\n324\n00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.580\nI showed most of these in the other show.\n\n325\n00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:09.549\nJust as a basic, if I fire up Safari and\nI go to a website like, slashdot.org.\n\n326\n00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.760\nI can go to their website and\nI can add a bookmark for it to say, hey,\n\n327\n00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:20.830\nI want to save this site and retain it,\nso that I'll have it in the future.\n\n328\n00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.610\nI want to be able to come to\nthis site every single day,\n\n329\n00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.100\nmake it really easy and\nI'll have that bookmark.\n\n330\n00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:32.420\nAnd because I have iCloud when I add\nit to my bookmarks over here, so\n\n331\n00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.870\nthere it is right on top of my bookmarks.\n\n332\n00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:39.040\nIt will get sync to other computers\nthat are also running iCloud.\n\n333\n00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.010\nNow my other system, it's an El Capitan\nbox, also it's not a stock and\n\n334\n00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.500\ninstall drive, installed the server\napp and turned off all the bells and\n\n335\n00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.180\nwhistles cuz I'm using it as a server.\n\n336\n00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.900\nBut I can still use iCloud here.\n\n337\n00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.110\nIt's not running by default.\n\n338\n00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.082\nIf I fire up Safari,\n\n339\n00:15:51.082 --> 00:15:54.526\nsure enough i don't see Slashdot\nhere on my list of favorites, right?\n\n340\n00:15:54.526 --> 00:15:58.226\nCuz I'm not running iCloud on it yet,\nI'm not synchronizing that data.\n\n341\n00:15:58.226 --> 00:16:02.626\nBut if I go into my system preferences And\nI go into iCloud, I can add it.\n\n342\n00:16:02.626 --> 00:16:05.908\nNow, there's not necessarily\na good reason or\n\n343\n00:16:05.908 --> 00:16:08.870\na bad reason to install\niCloud on a server.\n\n344\n00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.800\nIf I want to be able to remote manage it\nBack to my Mac, it's kind of useful, but\n\n345\n00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.400\nI'm probably not gonna use bookmark\nsynchronization to a server.\n\n346\n00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.410\nBut the functionality is possible.\n\n347\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.120\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\njust login with the same iCloud account.\n\n348\n00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.810\nAnd once I get logged in,\nI'm gonna configure the Keychain sync.\n\n349\n00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.810\nAnd with Keychain sync,\nit's gonna prompt me to verify my device,\n\n350\n00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:35.960\neither with a code or with an approval\nfrom another device that's signed in.\n\n351\n00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.860\nSo I'm gonna choose to get this set up,\nand it's only when it turns on\n\n352\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.450\nthe Keychain sync that's gonna happen,\nso as far synchronizing my bookmarks,\n\n353\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.640\nmy email and so on,\nit's gonna be happy with that.\n\n354\n00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.300\nIt's when we get to the Keychain that\nit's gonna require a little bit more.\n\n355\n00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.900\nSo here we are punching this in for\nthe Keychain, so I punch in that password,\n\n356\n00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.160\nwhich again, is my private key for this.\n\n357\n00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.320\nAnd now it's gonna ask me to authorize it.\n\n358\n00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.980\nAnd I'm just gonna use the code because\nI know my code now since I reset it.\n\n359\n00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.640\nIt's doing a quick query against Apple\nto find out whether it's a four digit or\n\n360\n00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.340\na six digit code.\n\n361\n00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:08.230\nAnd it sees that it is\nnow a six digit code.\n\n362\n00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.840\nSo I'll punch in that code and\nnow the extra verification.\n\n363\n00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.050\nIt's gonna send me a text message.\n\n364\n00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.080\nTo make sure that I am who I say I am.\n\n365\n00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.090\nAnd looks like that is going off.\n\n366\n00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:20.610\nAnd so here is my texted code.\n\n367\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:24.190\nIt is 173149, there we go.\n\n368\n00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.120\nAnd I don't mind saying that out loud.\n\n369\n00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.670\nIf you know my code,\nwell this is a one-time code.\n\n370\n00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.560\nIt's only useful now.\n\n371\n00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.000\nSo as soon as I hit OK, that code is gone.\n\n372\n00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.930\nAnd it's no longer usable.\n\n373\n00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.980\nSo the next time I do this\nI'd get a different code.\n\n374\n00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.930\nIt changes every time.\n\n375\n00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.010\nThat's the nice part about\na one time password.\n\n376\n00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.520\nAnd then lastly I'm gonna turn on\nBack to My Mac while I'm in here.\n\n377\n00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.460\nWe're gonna talk more about\nBack to My Mac in a minute.\n\n378\n00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.130\nOr actually,\nI didn't turn it on on the other side.\n\n379\n00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.360\nI'll leave it off here too.\n\n380\n00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.580\nAll right, so\nonce that's done now it's set up.\n\n381\n00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.820\nI've got iCloud, and I actually see some\naccounts are starting to come in and\n\n382\n00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:55.880\nother things.\n\n383\n00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.620\nThis is it trying to synchronize\nsettings through my iCloud account.\n\n384\n00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.000\nIt's learning things from iCloud,\nand I should see that right away,\n\n385\n00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.100\nespecially in Safari.\n\n386\n00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.760\nIf I fire up Safari, right there in\nmy favorites, I've got a Slashdot.\n\n387\n00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.620\nIt brought it back, okay.\n\n388\n00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.660\nBut I wanna focus on that keychain.\n\n389\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.410\nThe Keychain is the important part.\n\n390\n00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.400\nSo, back here on my original machine this\nis where we kind of set this stuff up\n\n391\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.062\noriginally, if I fire up\nthe Keychain access utility.\n\n392\n00:18:20.062 --> 00:18:24.740\nThe Keychain access utility is showing me\nall the different passwords, the logins,\n\n393\n00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.560\nthe iCloud data all of this,\nsecured notes and so\n\n394\n00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.380\non that's being stored in this\nencrypted Keychain database.\n\n395\n00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.630\nIf I come in and\nI create secure note or you know,\n\n396\n00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.820\nsome other type of information in here\nit's gonna get placed in here and\n\n397\n00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:44.560\nstored so\nmaybe this is my garage door code and\n\n398\n00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.900\nI just want to save it as 1234 and\nI'll add that in.\n\n399\n00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.510\nSo i'm now creating a secured node.\n\n400\n00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:53.440\nIt's secured because encrypted and\nstored in the Keychain database.\n\n401\n00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.570\nAnd if I browse to a website like if I,\n\n402\n00:18:55.570 --> 00:19:00.190\nlet me get out of Keychain\naccess here If I go to Slashdot.\n\n403\n00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.590\nThat was the favorite that I added.\n\n404\n00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.880\nAnd I log in.\n\n405\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.960\nWhen I go to log in.\n\n406\n00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.100\nIt's gonna ask if I wanna save\nmy username and password.\n\n407\n00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.550\nSo I'm gonna punch in my username and\npassword.\n\n408\n00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:13.800\nAnd I'm gonna log in.\n\n409\n00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.010\nAnd Safari is gonna prompt me with the\nold, hey do you wanna save that password?\n\n410\n00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:17.550\nI'm gonna say, yeah!\n\n411\n00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.400\nGo and save it.\n\n412\n00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.010\nAll right.\n\n413\n00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:22.360\nIt's saving that password\ninto my Keychain.\n\n414\n00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.190\nAnd now that it's in the Keychain,\nif I login again,\n\n415\n00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.370\nI don't have to provide the password.\n\n416\n00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.080\nIt will remember that password.\n\n417\n00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.510\nAnd if I go back into Keychain access,\nI can look in here and I can find it.\n\n418\n00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.080\nSee how you got like passwords right here?\n\n419\n00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.480\nAnd I see Apple ID, Apple Persist and\nall this Apple, Apple, Apple stuff.\n\n420\n00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.090\nRight?\n\n421\n00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.420\nAs we keep scrolling down, you'll start\nto see other logins that we've done.\n\n422\n00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.510\nSomewhere in here,\nif we browse around enough.\n\n423\n00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.728\nProbably would have been faster for\nme to search.\n\n424\n00:19:48.728 --> 00:19:52.960\nWe'll find Slashdot buried away where\nit saved my username and password for\n\n425\n00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.760\nthat site.\n\n426\n00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.086\nSo, it's being stored\nhere in the Keychain.\n\n427\n00:19:56.086 --> 00:19:57.017\nSomewhere.\n\n428\n00:19:57.017 --> 00:20:00.000\n[LAUGH] You know,\njust kind of glancing at it here,\n\n429\n00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.910\nI'm not spotting it right off-hand.\n\n430\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.630\nYou have more than one Keychain.\n\n431\n00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.000\nSo like I was looking\nat the login Keychain.\n\n432\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.065\nYou've got the iCloud Keychain.\n\n433\n00:20:09.065 --> 00:20:10.275\nThere it is.\n\n434\n00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:10.865\nWell, it makes sense.\n\n435\n00:20:10.865 --> 00:20:13.618\nThis is an iCloud show that I would\nsee that Keychain right there,\n\n436\n00:20:13.618 --> 00:20:15.385\nslashotdot.org I logged in with donpezet.\n\n437\n00:20:15.385 --> 00:20:20.005\nIt's a web form, I used it today,\nit's now stored in my iCloud Keychain.\n\n438\n00:20:20.005 --> 00:20:23.005\nSo this information is getting\nplaced in there and saved.\n\n439\n00:20:23.005 --> 00:20:24.075\nYou'll see some Google stuff.\n\n440\n00:20:24.075 --> 00:20:25.475\nI wonder where that come from.\n\n441\n00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:26.835\nWell, that came from iCloud already.\n\n442\n00:20:26.835 --> 00:20:29.885\nI already had that saved somewhere so\nit's being brought in that.\n\n443\n00:20:29.885 --> 00:20:32.740\nSo I've got that information and\nis being synchronized.\n\n444\n00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:37.720\nIf I jump over to my other system,\nthis system is logged in with iCloud.\n\n445\n00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.790\nAnd if I bring up my keychain access and\ngo into it and\n\n446\n00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:45.050\nlook at its iCloud,\nit sees Slashdot right there.\n\n447\n00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:46.810\nThat username and\npassword is synchronized over here.\n\n448\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.110\nAnd so when I go into Safari and\nI go to Slashdot and\n\n449\n00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.570\nI go to log in,\nthis system should remember, and\n\n450\n00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:57.230\nsure enough, it's already populating\nit with the username and a password.\n\n451\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.450\nNow, from a convenience standpoint,\nthat's really convenient.\n\n452\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.260\nThat made life easy.\n\n453\n00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.970\nFrom a usability standpoint, it's great.\n\n454\n00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:10.050\nFrom a security standpoint, well,\nwe're putting a lot of trust in Apple.\n\n455\n00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.200\nThey are encrypting all this.\n\n456\n00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.800\nThe Keychain is an encrypted\ndatabase that is encrypted with your\n\n457\n00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.820\nprivate key that Apple doesn't know.\n\n458\n00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.330\nSo they can't decrypt it.\n\n459\n00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.150\nAll they can do is erase it.\n\n460\n00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.440\nRemember when I couldn't\nremember my code what did I do?\n\n461\n00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.600\nI erased my Keychain.\n\n462\n00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.020\nThat's the only fallback\nthey give me on that, so\n\n463\n00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.360\nthat's where you get that added security.\n\n464\n00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.700\nSo that's the Keychain and how it works.\n\n465\n00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.710\nIt's mostly automatic, most users\ndon't even know the Keychain exists,\n\n466\n00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.720\nthey don't deal with that,\nit just runs in the background and\n\n467\n00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.240\nthat's it they don't think about it,\nbut it is kinda of important.\n\n468\n00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.560\nNow, Back to My Mac that's the other\none that's a bit of security concern.\n\n469\n00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.180\nIf I go to my system preferences and\n\n470\n00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:50.620\ngo into iCloud you'll see that Back to\nMy Mac is not turned on by default.\n\n471\n00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:54.320\nAnd the reason is, what Back to My Mac\ndoes is it lets somebody remotely view\n\n472\n00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.990\nyour screen,\nsee exactly what you're doing, all right?\n\n473\n00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.230\nThat's not something you'd\nwant just anybody to do.\n\n474\n00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:04.710\nSo when I turn on Back to My Mac,\nit's gonna turn it on, and\n\n475\n00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:05.730\nI'm allowing that feature.\n\n476\n00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.040\nSo I need to make sure that it's secure.\n\n477\n00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.400\nWell, it gives me some\nlittle warnings that well,\n\n478\n00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.560\nit should give me a warning,\nthat I need to turn on screen sharing and\n\n479\n00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.270\nI need to turn on file sharing in\norder for Back to My Mac to work.\n\n480\n00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.970\nSo if I pull up my details it'll\nprobably tell me that those are off.\n\n481\n00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.960\nYeah, it's telling me they're off and\nI need to go turn that on.\n\n482\n00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.030\nSo I'm gonna hit open sharing,\nand I'll turn those on.\n\n483\n00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:26.390\nAnd all you really need to do is click\nscreen sharing and click file sharing.\n\n484\n00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:27.070\nThat's gonna turn them on.\n\n485\n00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.630\nBut look at the permissions.\n\n486\n00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:34.490\nWhen I go to Screen Sharing, it's saying\nonly these users, Administrators.\n\n487\n00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.840\nIf I have more than one\nadministrator on this computer,\n\n488\n00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.430\nthey'll all be able to\nremotely see the screen.\n\n489\n00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.900\nThey'll be able to see the screen\neven if it's me logged in.\n\n490\n00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.580\nI can be logged in and another\nadministrator could be watching me.\n\n491\n00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.960\nI might not want that.\n\n492\n00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.940\nOdds are I shouldn't have\n\n493\n00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.220\nthem as administrators anyway if\nI don't have that level of trust.\n\n494\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.570\nBut you can change this\nto be very specific.\n\n495\n00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:59.320\nSo I could add it in and say,\nI just want Don Pezet to be able to\n\n496\n00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.780\ndo the Back to My Mac, and I could remove\nAdministrators from the group, right?\n\n497\n00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.330\nI'm the only admin anyway,\nso it doesn't really matter.\n\n498\n00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.210\nBut if I had more than one admin,\nI could do that.\n\n499\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.360\nOr I could make it where\nany user could do it.\n\n500\n00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.040\nIf this was a shared computer, any of\nthe users could get at it, all right?\n\n501\n00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.740\nSo that's what we're putting in there.\n\n502\n00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.120\nAnd notice that once screen sharing is on,\n\n503\n00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.890\nit's turning on VNC which is\nVirtual Network Computing.\n\n504\n00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.790\nIt's a screen-sharing program.\n\n505\n00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.780\nIt would normally only work\non our local area network.\n\n506\n00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.600\nBut now it's gonna work across\nthe internet thanks to Back to My Mac\n\n507\n00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.800\nthanks to attaching it to iCloud.\n\n508\n00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.670\nAll right, same thing goes for\nfile sharing.\n\n509\n00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:33.120\nFile sharing would normally only\nwork on our local network but\n\n510\n00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.970\niCloud is gonna make it where it'll\nwork over the internet using iCloud.\n\n511\n00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.130\nAll right, so now that those are on,\n\n512\n00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.140\nthe Back to My Mac functionality\nshould be nice and functional.\n\n513\n00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.720\nIf I go into iCloud, and\n\n514\n00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.940\nI look at the details from Back to my Mac,\nit's turned on.\n\n515\n00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.231\nBut it's warning me Back to my Mac may\nbe slow because NetPort mapping or\n\n516\n00:23:52.231 --> 00:23:55.608\nUniversal Plug and\nPlay is turned off on your computer.\n\n517\n00:23:55.608 --> 00:23:56.426\nOn your router.\n\n518\n00:23:56.426 --> 00:23:57.946\nWhat's that talking about?\n\n519\n00:23:57.946 --> 00:24:01.966\nWell, in order for back to my Mac to work\nThere's a number of ports that have to be\n\n520\n00:24:01.966 --> 00:24:03.168\nopen on your firewall.\n\n521\n00:24:03.168 --> 00:24:06.505\nWe have a firewall here at ITProTV,\nand those ports are not open for\n\n522\n00:24:06.505 --> 00:24:07.750\nthis computer.\n\n523\n00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.530\nAnd so it's saying hey, it'll work,\nbut it's gonna be slow.\n\n524\n00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:14.830\nIf you want it to be fast, you need to go\nand open up some ports on your firewall.\n\n525\n00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.420\nAnd there's about eight ports all\ntogether, I'll put them in the show notes,\n\n526\n00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.280\nso if any of you ever have to\nconfigure a firewall to do it,\n\n527\n00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.380\nyou'll be able to do that.\n\n528\n00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.934\nFor most home users UPMP Universal Plug\nand Play and NAT-PMP,\n\n529\n00:24:24.934 --> 00:24:29.208\nthese two things allow your system\nautomatically configure the router.\n\n530\n00:24:29.208 --> 00:24:31.670\nYour laptop will tell the router,\nhey can you point these ports to me,\n\n531\n00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.580\nand the router will do it.\n\n532\n00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.109\nAnd so you don't have to worry about it.\n\n533\n00:24:34.109 --> 00:24:36.470\nBut if you do it manually I'll\nput the port in the show so\n\n534\n00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.490\nthat you guys can access on it.\n\n535\n00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.710\nIf a firewall is blocking it though,\nthis isn't gonna work.\n\n536\n00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:42.910\nAnd it could actually be you.\n\n537\n00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:45.590\nRemember that MacOS does have a firewall.\n\n538\n00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.800\nIf I go back to my system preferences and\nI go to security and privacy and\n\n539\n00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:53.890\nI go to the firewall tab,\nthere is a firewall built in MacOS and\n\n540\n00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:57.010\nit can stop back to my\nMac from working also.\n\n541\n00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.700\nSo if it's turned on,\nyou'll want to check the settings.\n\n542\n00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.130\nLet me check this one real quick.\n\n543\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:01.970\nSo I'm gonna turn that on.\n\n544\n00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.210\nAnd once the firewall's on, you can go to\nfirewall options and you'll see what's\n\n545\n00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:10.250\nallowed through and see how file sharing\nand screen sharing are both allowed?\n\n546\n00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:10.780\nThat's good.\n\n547\n00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.550\nI want that.\n\n548\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.620\nI need that for Back to My Mac to work.\n\n549\n00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.130\nIf it's not there,\nit's going to be broken.\n\n550\n00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.890\nAnd you can hit the plus sign and\nadd in all sorts of other stuff,\n\n551\n00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:21.720\nall your other programs that you need,\nbut those are the two that I needed.\n\n552\n00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.150\nSo it's added them for\nme because it knows that I need them.\n\n553\n00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.440\nSo just be aware that your own\nfirewall could be causing the problem.\n\n554\n00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.680\nAll right.\n\n555\n00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.860\nI find that typically as long as\nyou list it, it's gonna work fine.\n\n556\n00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.510\nThe only one that really causes a problem\nis this guy down here at the bottom,\n\n557\n00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:36.230\nenable stealth mode.\n\n558\n00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.740\nOn a normal Mac you can\nping it on the network.\n\n559\n00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.000\nSo if somebody tries to ping your Mac,\nthey'll get a response.\n\n560\n00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.930\nWhen you're in stealth mode,\nyou stop responding to pings.\n\n561\n00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.700\nIf somebody tries to ping you, it looks\nlike you're not even on the network.\n\n562\n00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.540\nIt hides your computer from the network.\n\n563\n00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.580\nAnd that's good from\na security standpoint.\n\n564\n00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:58.420\nBut with Back to my Mac, I need to be\nanywhere in the world and find my Mac, and\n\n565\n00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.380\nif my Mac is running in stealth mode,\nI might not be able to do that.\n\n566\n00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.590\nI'll have to wait for\nthese various timed intervals or\n\n567\n00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.900\nmy system phones home to Apple's\nservers before I can find it.\n\n568\n00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.010\nAnd so\nthat slows the connection down too, and\n\n569\n00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:12.080\nsometimes you can actually break it and\nstop it from working altogether.\n\n570\n00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.290\nSo if you're in that stealth mode,\nyou might need to turn that off.\n\n571\n00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:18.200\nNow, the default is that the firewall\nisn't even turned on in the first place.\n\n572\n00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.360\nSo it's not likely your problem.\n\n573\n00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.050\nBut if it is turned on,\nyou'll definitely need to go in there and\n\n574\n00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:23.990\nmake sure that it's proved.\n\n575\n00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.170\nOnce it's turned on though,\nI'm now enabled with Back to My Mac.\n\n576\n00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.300\nIt's reporting back to Apple servers.\n\n577\n00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.690\nAnd I can use it.\n\n578\n00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.530\nNow most of this services I can\ngo anywhere in the world and\n\n579\n00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:38.790\nI go in iCloud.com, I can log in and\nI can remotely connect to this machine\n\n580\n00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.640\nback to my Mac is not like,\nI mentioned that in another show.\n\n581\n00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.970\nSo the way we connect is\nthrough using the finder,\n\n582\n00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.490\nnow the neat part is when you fire up\nyour finder you see network servers and\n\n583\n00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.910\nyou normally only see the servers\nthat are on the same network as you.\n\n584\n00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.920\nAnd workstations, not just servers.\n\n585\n00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.840\nBut when you're out in the world,\nyou only see people near you.\n\n586\n00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.850\nYou don't necessarily see people back\nat your office or back at your home.\n\n587\n00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.780\nSo what Back to my Mac does is let\nyou sync that information via iCloud.\n\n588\n00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.360\nSo I can be anywhere in the world,\nand I'll see this network system,\n\n589\n00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.490\neven though it's not on\nthe same network as me.\n\n590\n00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:12.360\nSo when I jump over to my other system,\nwhen I go to my other OS X system I can\n\n591\n00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:19.450\nlaunch my Finder and over here I'm gonna\nsee Shared devices including Don's Mac.\n\n592\n00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.590\nAnd see how it has a question mark by it?\n\n593\n00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.390\nNormally it identifies\nwhat that system is.\n\n594\n00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:26.850\nAnd it says, yeah it's a laptop so\nI'll give it a laptop icon.\n\n595\n00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.390\nOr it's desktop or an iMac,\nI'll give it the icon for that.\n\n596\n00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:31.250\nAnd it gives an icon that\nmatches the computer.\n\n597\n00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.050\nHere's a Mac Mini right?\n\n598\n00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:34.220\nBut if it can't identify it.\n\n599\n00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.790\nIf it's a remote machine it\ngives it a question mark.\n\n600\n00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:40.010\nAnd so\nthere's Don's Mac with a question mark.\n\n601\n00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.070\nAnd when I browse to it I see the files.\n\n602\n00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.480\nWell, I'm on the local network.\n\n603\n00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.550\nNormally I wouldn't see those but\nif you've got iCloud,\n\n604\n00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.050\nsee how it says connected as don@itpro.tv.\n\n605\n00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.400\nIt connected with my Apple ID.\n\n606\n00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.690\nI'll actually see the folders.\n\n607\n00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.490\nAnd I can browse into them even\nthough I'm not on the same network.\n\n608\n00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:57.870\nIt's doing it all through iCloud.\n\n609\n00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.310\nAnd I've got screen sharing.\n\n610\n00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:05.470\nI can hit share screen and it's going\nto reach out to that Mac and it's gonna\n\n611\n00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:10.060\nestablish a VMC session, and now I can see\nthe screen of that remote computer, and\n\n612\n00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.000\nnot only can I see it, I can work with it.\n\n613\n00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.460\nSo I can get in here and\nI can Jump into my system preferences.\n\n614\n00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.340\nI can start to use the computer\nas if I was sitting right there.\n\n615\n00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.170\nSo, maybe I fire up the web browser.\n\n616\n00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.794\nAnd I go to ITPro.TV, right.\n\n617\n00:28:24.794 --> 00:28:29.370\nI'm on my El Capitan server here, right.\n\n618\n00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.700\nBut if I go back to my\nworkstation Here it is.\n\n619\n00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.350\nIt's been running that web browser.\n\n620\n00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:36.010\nIt's been launching those programs or\ndoing whatever,\n\n621\n00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:37.630\ngoing into system preferences.\n\n622\n00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.790\nBack to my Mac is showing me that, and\nI can do that from anywhere in the world.\n\n623\n00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.000\nOn the local network,\nit will be nice and fast.\n\n624\n00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.170\nWhen you go out in the real world, things\nstart to get a little slower, right?\n\n625\n00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.810\nIt's based on your Internet bandwidth.\n\n626\n00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.990\nAnd so up top, you do have a few\nlittle options here for tweaking it.\n\n627\n00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.130\nSo for\nexample whether you just wanna view or\n\n628\n00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:57.360\nwhether you wanna control\nyou can do scaling.\n\n629\n00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.140\nA lot of time that might on a MacBook\nwith a small screen connected to a retina\n\n630\n00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:05.320\neye Mac that's got a massive screen and so\nI might need to try on scaling It's what I\n\n631\n00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.420\nsee it in the right resolution and so\nnow see I've got scroll bars here so\n\n632\n00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.820\nI can scroll around and just see parts of\nthe screen instead of trying to scale it,\n\n633\n00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.640\nsee the whole thing it\nmakes everything small.\n\n634\n00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.666\nI might have to tweak that.\n\n635\n00:29:15.666 --> 00:29:18.340\nAnd then you've got a shared clipboard,\nso you can copy and\n\n636\n00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:22.100\npaste stuff from your local machine to\nthe remote machine and vise versa, right?\n\n637\n00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:26.610\nThat's Back to my Mac that was me see\nthat remote desktop from anywhere.\n\n638\n00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:27.860\nAnywhere in the world.\n\n639\n00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.630\nReally cool feature but\nturned off by default.\n\n640\n00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:33.100\nSo for\nthe exam what do we need to remember?\n\n641\n00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:37.320\nWell we need to remember that iCloud has\nto be turned on, it's not on by default.\n\n642\n00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.930\nIt can be turned on during\nthe initial set up or\n\n643\n00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:42.400\nit can be turned on later by going\ninto the iCloud system preference.\n\n644\n00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:49.840\nThen by default It's doing collaboration\nstuff, mail, calendar, context, notes.\n\n645\n00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:56.170\nIt's doing that kind of basic stuff but\nyou can add on to it and\n\n646\n00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:00.860\nonce you add on to it, then you can\ndo key chain, and back to my Mac.\n\n647\n00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.420\nSharing your passwords and\nsharing your screens, really sensitive.\n\n648\n00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.940\nRemember that those two\nare off by default.\n\n649\n00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.380\nAnd the other thing to remember is\nI've used it right here through a Mac.\n\n650\n00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.500\nYou do have the iCloud.com web interface.\n\n651\n00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:17.330\nSo on this one on my server,\nI could have browsed to iCloud.com, And\n\n652\n00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:19.910\nonce I'm on icloud.com\nI can login with my ID.\n\n653\n00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.240\nSo, let me just get in here and\npunch that in.\n\n654\n00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.240\nAll right.\n\n655\n00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.490\nAnd once I'm logged in,\nI can start to access these resources.\n\n656\n00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:32.030\nWell, I gotta verify my systems.\n\n657\n00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.250\nLet me just verify that really quick.\n\n658\n00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:37.130\nIt's gonna send me a text message With yet\nanother code so I'll wait for that little\n\n659\n00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:40.860\ntext message to come in and as soon as I\ndo that it will unlock all of these tools.\n\n660\n00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.340\nHere comes my code which\nis seven three five one.\n\n661\n00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:48.880\nSo I punch in that code so it knows that\nI am who I say I am and now I can get\n\n662\n00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.040\ninto mail, contacts, calendar, photos,\nmy iCloud storage, I can get to that.\n\n663\n00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.820\nBut you'll notice that I'm missing things.\n\n664\n00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.900\nI'm missing Back to My Mac.\n\n665\n00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.040\nI'm missing Keychain.\n\n666\n00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.750\nAnd that's cuz those are sensitive.\n\n667\n00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:00.540\nThey're secure.\n\n668\n00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.700\nThey're not allowed to be\naccessed from the webpage.\n\n669\n00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.250\nBecause to access them from the webpage\nmeans that Apple would have to be able to\n\n670\n00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:06.300\nopen them for us.\n\n671\n00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.270\nAnd they don't wanna be able to do that.\n\n672\n00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.020\nThey don't wanna have that liability.\n\n673\n00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.990\nBut I can do other things.\n\n674\n00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.070\nI can use Find My iPhone.\n\n675\n00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:16.730\nSo if I have a, I've lost my device,\nI can fire this up and try and\n\n676\n00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:18.060\nlocate them, right?\n\n677\n00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:22.240\nAnd iOS has Find my iPhone, but it can\nfind all of your devices, your laptops,\n\n678\n00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.620\nyour servers, and so on.\n\n679\n00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.130\nAnd so here it's looking out, and\nI've got those two devices, right?\n\n680\n00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:30.740\nOne is my regular desktop and\none is my server.\n\n681\n00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.260\nAnd so it's trying to locate those, and\n\n682\n00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:37.800\nthis is supposed to be a nice little map\nthat is Not rendering for some reason..\n\n683\n00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.120\nIt's good old Apple Maps.\n\n684\n00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.660\nSo, it's trying to leverage Apple Maps to\nshow me where the heck this stuff is in\n\n685\n00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:48.800\nthe map, you can sort of see where\nit recognizes that I'm in Florida.\n\n686\n00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.340\nSo, it's trying to figure out where those\ndevices are and show them to me, right?\n\n687\n00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.660\nSo that's part of what we can do here.\n\n688\n00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.600\nBut one of the best features,\nin my opinion,\n\n689\n00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.300\nis that if you lose a device,\nyou can lock it and even remote wipe it.\n\n690\n00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.490\nSo, when I come in here and\npick a device, there's a DPLaptop,\n\n691\n00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.140\nI don't want to mess with that one.\n\n692\n00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:10.280\nIf I go to one of my other devices,\ndot iPad Pro,\n\n693\n00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.460\nI got a ton devices all\nin this one location.\n\n694\n00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.370\nMy iPhone Eventually,\nI'll find the other ones.\n\n695\n00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.530\nBut I can keep clicking here until\nI find the device that I want.\n\n696\n00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:23.780\nAnd when I manage the device,\nI can play a sound so I can find it.\n\n697\n00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.940\nI can put it in lost mode\nwhere it gets locked.\n\n698\n00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.120\nOr I can even just erase it,\nwipe it, and be done with it.\n\n699\n00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.380\nAnd that's my iPad but you can do the same\nthing with the laptops and the desktop.\n\n700\n00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.440\nThe other devices will do that too\nyou've got that functionality.\n\n701\n00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:39.050\nSo really cool stuff there that you\ncan kind of control and reset and\n\n702\n00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:43.170\nprotect these things, and\nhave it nice ad safe like that.\n\n703\n00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:45.190\nAll functionalities inside of iCloud.\n\n704\n00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:49.080\nSo from a security standpoint,\nyes you are putting your trust in Apple to\n\n705\n00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.780\nstore this data securely,\nbut at the same time,\n\n706\n00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.190\nyou're the one generating the encryption\nkeys, you're the one who holds those keys.\n\n707\n00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.160\nYou're the one who has access, right?\n\n708\n00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.380\nOther people don't have that access even\nif Apple gets subpoena, they only have\n\n709\n00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:04.110\naccess to some data we've seen that in\nthe news quite a bit especially lately.\n\n710\n00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:05.960\nBut that's about it for iCloud,\n\n711\n00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.160\nlet's me see if there's anything\nelse that I wanna mention.\n\n712\n00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.120\nI did mention those ports that we need\nto be open on a firewall from Back to\n\n713\n00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:12.780\nMy Mac to work.\n\n714\n00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.130\nI did put those in the ShowNotes,\nthey will be available definitely.\n\n715\n00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:16.300\nCheck that out.\n\n716\n00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.850\nAlright, in this episode we had a pretty\ngood run down of iCloud and what is does.\n\n717\n00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.560\nWe focused on those two\nsensitive features.\n\n718\n00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.450\nThe Key Chain and Back to my Mac.You\ndefinetly want to be aware of those,\n\n719\n00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:26.742\nespecially on the exam but\nin real life also.\n\n720\n00:33:26.742 --> 00:33:28.920\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n721\n00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.130\nThat's about it for this episode.\n\n722\n00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:32.018\nSo I am gonna go ahead and\nsign off on this one.\n\n723\n00:33:32.018 --> 00:33:36.100\nStay tuned, cuz we got more Apple\ncertified Support Professional coming up\n\n724\n00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.200\nbut for now, that's a wrap.\n\n725\n00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.410\nSo, signing off for ITProTV.\n\n726\n00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:43.385\nI'm Don Pezet, and I'll see you next time.\n\n727\n00:33:43.385 --> 00:33:49.190\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.731\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:19.350\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.670\nBack again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n6\n00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.379\nAnd yes, once again, I'm all by myself.\n\n7\n00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:28.168\nSo my host Eddie got pulled aside for\nanother show, so I'm running it solo.\n\n8\n00:00:28.168 --> 00:00:29.572\nBut that's okay because today,\n\n9\n00:00:29.572 --> 00:00:32.140\nwe're still gonna continue\nwith our networking concepts.\n\n10\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.588\nSo we're gonna be sharing things on the\nnetwork and it takes two people to share.\n\n11\n00:00:35.588 --> 00:00:39.081\nSo I'll have a virtual computer here\nto step in and be my co-host for\n\n12\n00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:39.830\nme this time.\n\n13\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.610\nBut this is an important topic because\nthere's actually a number of different\n\n14\n00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.970\nthings that we can share between two Macs.\n\n15\n00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.110\nWhen you have two Macs that are connected\nto a network, or I shouldn't say two Macs.\n\n16\n00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.130\nIt can be a Mac and a PC,\nfor all that matters.\n\n17\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.410\nIf you have two computers\non the same network,\n\n18\n00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.480\nyou can share all sorts of\nresources between them.\n\n19\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.957\nAnd for the exam and for real life,\nwe need to know how to set that up,\n\n20\n00:00:59.957 --> 00:01:02.583\nhow to get it configured,\nand how to make use of it.\n\n21\n00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:07.265\nSo that's what we're gonna walk through\ntoday, all about sharing resources.\n\n22\n00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:10.575\nWell let's kick this off by kind\nof looking at what's available for\n\n23\n00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:11.355\nus on our system.\n\n24\n00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:13.725\nAnd it does vary a little bit\nbased on what you've got.\n\n25\n00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:17.270\nSo for example,\nI can share a printer on the network.\n\n26\n00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.640\nBut that assumes that I have a printer.\n\n27\n00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.180\nIf I don't have a printer,\nI can't really share a printer, can I?\n\n28\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.600\nSo depending on what you have, you may or\nmay not be able to use all these options.\n\n29\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.380\nBut it's important to know what's\nout there and what's available.\n\n30\n00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.760\nAnd we can see that pretty easy.\n\n31\n00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.440\nI've got my trusty El Capitan\nvirtual machine fired up here,\n\n32\n00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.530\nwhich is a stock install, so\neverything is pretty basic.\n\n33\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.310\nThe only thing I've done is\nthrown a CD in the CD drive.\n\n34\n00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.070\nNow that's another good one right there.\n\n35\n00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.950\nWhat Macs come with a CD drive today?\n\n36\n00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.150\nI don't think any of them do.\n\n37\n00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.290\nI'm pretty sure if you\ngo to Apple's website,\n\n38\n00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.260\nnone of the current lineup of\nMacs come with an optical drive.\n\n39\n00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.220\nThey used to,\nnow it's an external super drive.\n\n40\n00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.610\nIt's an option that you can choose to buy,\nbut most of us don't have that.\n\n41\n00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.806\nWell, if you wanna share a CD or\nDVD on the network,\n\n42\n00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:00.400\nyou kind of need one of those drives.\n\n43\n00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.910\nSo I've added one in here.\n\n44\n00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.600\nBut if you go into your\nsystem preferences,\n\n45\n00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.890\nyou got a system preference and\nthey're called sharing.\n\n46\n00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.220\nThis little guy right here.\n\n47\n00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.350\nAnd all of our sharing options\nare tucked away right in that folder.\n\n48\n00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.144\nAnd I know I've come in to\nthis on other episodes,\n\n49\n00:02:13.144 --> 00:02:15.083\ncuz we've seen things that\nwere related to sharing.\n\n50\n00:02:15.083 --> 00:02:18.410\nBut we haven't gone through and\ncovered each of them individually.\n\n51\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.520\nAnd you'll see right off,\nthere's a lot of stuff that we can share.\n\n52\n00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.040\nWell, let's just run down the list and\nwe'll cover each one and\n\n53\n00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.080\nkind of how it works.\n\n54\n00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.160\nThe first one is DVD or CD Sharing.\n\n55\n00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.710\nSo I said, no Mac really comes\nwith this optical drive anymore.\n\n56\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.350\nIt's not built in to any of\nthe current lineup of devices.\n\n57\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.460\nNow, there are older ones.\n\n58\n00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.050\nYou might have the original Mac mini.\n\n59\n00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.120\nIt had an optical drive\nright in the top of it.\n\n60\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.390\nThere were a lot of MacBooks,\nthe older MacBook Pros.\n\n61\n00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.562\nThey had optical drives in there.\n\n62\n00:02:44.562 --> 00:02:46.190\nI know a lot of people\nwould rip them out and\n\n63\n00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.310\nput an extra hard drive into their place,\nso you had some kind of flexibility.\n\n64\n00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.960\nBut there were systems\nthat had optical drives.\n\n65\n00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.550\nSince our new systems don't,\nwhat if somebody sends me a DVD,\n\n66\n00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.960\nwhat am I going to do with it?\n\n67\n00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.680\nWell, I might have a super drive\nthat I share around the office, and\n\n68\n00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.130\nthat's actually what we\ndo here at the studio.\n\n69\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.580\nWe have one that we share around.\n\n70\n00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.370\nBut if you don't want to do that,\nyou could take it and attach it to\n\n71\n00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.550\none computer and have that one computer\nshare the disk on the network.\n\n72\n00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.560\nAnd that's what DVD or\nCD sharing is all about.\n\n73\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.620\nSo when we turn this option on, it's gonna\nsay that we're gonna allow that DVD or\n\n74\n00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.290\nCD to be shared out.\n\n75\n00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.498\nAnd here it's saying, ask me before\nallowing others to use my DVD drive.\n\n76\n00:03:22.498 --> 00:03:24.809\nIn other words,\nif somebody tries to connect to my drive,\n\n77\n00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.810\nit's gonna prompt me for permissions.\n\n78\n00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.140\nWell if this is like a headless unit,\nmaybe I've got a Mac Mini stuck in\n\n79\n00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.210\na closet somewhere that's\nserving this purpose.\n\n80\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.960\nI might not want to be prompted,\nI might want to turn that off.\n\n81\n00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.080\nUsually we wanna require authentication\nbecause we're worried about security,\n\n82\n00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.380\nwe're worried about privacy.\n\n83\n00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.370\nI don't want somebody going in and\n\n84\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.700\ndeleting files when\nthey're not supposed to.\n\n85\n00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.750\nWell can they delete files on a CD or DVD?\n\n86\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.990\nNo, it's already written, it's read only.\n\n87\n00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.780\nThey can't delete files, they can't change\nfiles, so I'm not gonna worry about that.\n\n88\n00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.510\nSo permissions are far less important.\n\n89\n00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.490\nWell, unless that disk has\ndata on it that is important.\n\n90\n00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.100\nMaybe you've got backups from\nyour accounting software.\n\n91\n00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.650\nYou don't want that out there, right?\n\n92\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.920\nSo in that case, we would turn on this\nAsk me before allowing, and in that way,\n\n93\n00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.380\nwe would get prompted when\nsomebody tried to connect.\n\n94\n00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.680\nNow once that's set up, I'm now\nbroadcasting via Bonjour on the network.\n\n95\n00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.830\nAnd telling everybody else, hey,\nI've got a CD drive attached.\n\n96\n00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.270\nAnd not only do I have a CD drive\nattached, it's got a disk in it.\n\n97\n00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.300\nAnd you'll see back here I've got the\nCentOS Linux disk popped into this drive.\n\n98\n00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.370\nSo on my system when I click on that and\n\n99\n00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.110\nbrowse to it,\nI see the contents of that disk.\n\n100\n00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.700\nSo here it is, right?\n\n101\n00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.090\nAnd it is a CD so if I try and delete\nfiles or whatever well, they're read only.\n\n102\n00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.210\nI can't mess with it.\n\n103\n00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.530\nIt's a read only media.\n\n104\n00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.060\nSo it's been written, it's right there,\nand now I'm sharing it on the network.\n\n105\n00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.590\nOther systems will start to see it, right?\n\n106\n00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.520\nSo if I jump over to another\nsystem like this one.\n\n107\n00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.160\nAnd I browse the network\nwhen I go into my finder,\n\n108\n00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.280\nI'm gonna see various computers\nthat are out there on the network.\n\n109\n00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.530\nSo I see like my laptop and\nEditing Station and so on.\n\n110\n00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.070\nWell I actually don't remember\nwhat this computer is called.\n\n111\n00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.830\nIt's right here.\n\n112\n00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.760\nIt's called Don's Mac.\n\n113\n00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.230\nSo they're gonna find it on the network.\n\n114\n00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.080\nIt's called Don's Mac.\n\n115\n00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.838\nWell I'm gonna rename that because\nthis computer's actually OSX-CLIENT01.\n\n116\n00:05:06.838 --> 00:05:09.010\nI just wanna be able to\ntell what machine this is.\n\n117\n00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.188\nI'm gonna change its name.\n\n118\n00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:12.400\nChanging the name is kind of important,\n\n119\n00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.760\nbecause what happens when\nyou install a new Mac\n\n120\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.860\nis it asks you to create a user account.\n\n121\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.800\nAnd it names the Mac off\nof that user account, so\n\n122\n00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.940\nyou'll see Don's MacBook Pro or\nDon's iMac or something like that.\n\n123\n00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.290\nWell, in an enterprise environment,\n\n124\n00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.980\nwhat if you have a computer that's\nshared by more than one person?\n\n125\n00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.890\nWell, it's named after the first person.\n\n126\n00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.100\nSo that doesn't necessarily\nmean anything to us.\n\n127\n00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.940\nOr what if that employee's terminated and\nsomebody else takes over?\n\n128\n00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.830\nSo it was Bob in accounting.\n\n129\n00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.970\nWe let Bob go, and\nnow we have Alice in accounting.\n\n130\n00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.040\nBut Alice is on Bob's Mac.\n\n131\n00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.070\nSo we might wanna change that name so\nthat people can find it,\n\n132\n00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.740\nand it's easy enough to\nchange it right there.\n\n133\n00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.500\nNotice the default format.\n\n134\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.560\nIt's OSX-CLIENT01.local.\n\n135\n00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.790\nDot local.\n\n136\n00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.340\nIf you're not bound to\nan open directory or\n\n137\n00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.110\nan active directory it will\njust end in dot local.\n\n138\n00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.320\nThis is a local name on my network.\n\n139\n00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.470\nBut if you're bound to a directory\nservice you might have a true DNS name,\n\n140\n00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.250\na fully qualified name, so\nI might have OSX-CLIENT01.lab.ITPro.tv.\n\n141\n00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.130\nAnd so I might need to change that .local.\n\n142\n00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.030\nAnd I can't really do that right here.\n\n143\n00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.270\nBut if I hit the Edit button,\nthat's where we start to see it.\n\n144\n00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.940\nAnd see how it says use\na dynamic global hostname?\n\n145\n00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.670\nIt's gonna try and figure out what my\nhost name should be, it's going to well,\n\n146\n00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.370\nuse .local unless I'm bound.\n\n147\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.770\nBut if I check that off, now I can come in\nand specify additional information to get\n\n148\n00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.910\nthat set and we can advertise\nthese services using Bonjour.\n\n149\n00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.090\nSo, we got some advance functionality\nif we need it, all right.\n\n150\n00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.620\nI'm just gonna leave it\nkind of the way that it is.\n\n151\n00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.840\nNow, back over here on this guy,\nhe's browsing the network.\n\n152\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.090\nHe's fires up the finder and looks under\nthe shared section in the finder and\n\n153\n00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.040\nwell, actually I don't\nsee that other machine.\n\n154\n00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.500\nI don't see Don's Mac, I don't see\nOSX-CLIENT01, why don't I see it?\n\n155\n00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.200\nWell there could be a few reasons.\n\n156\n00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.220\nFirst off, the way that we detect this,\nyour Macs are all running a series of\n\n157\n00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.930\nprotocols they can use to scan the network\nand find other hosts that are out there.\n\n158\n00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:08.980\nRight?\n\n159\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.010\nPrimarily they use two protocols.\n\n160\n00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.790\nThe main one is Bonjour.\n\n161\n00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.394\nBonjour is a protocol developed by Apple\nthat makes it really easy for computers\n\n162\n00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:20.022\nto find each other, locate them on\nthe network, get connected and go, right?\n\n163\n00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:22.621\nBonjour is all about easy.\n\n164\n00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:25.533\nBut there is also the SDP,\nthe Service Discovery protocol and\n\n165\n00:07:25.533 --> 00:07:28.788\nthat's part of IPv6 and some of\nthe other technologies in your Mac.\n\n166\n00:07:28.788 --> 00:07:31.094\nAnd that one's scanning\nthe network too and\n\n167\n00:07:31.094 --> 00:07:33.245\nlooking to find systems on the network.\n\n168\n00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:37.538\nThere's all different protocols that are\navailable, and there is several of them.\n\n169\n00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:40.770\nI've actually got a list tucked away here\nsomewhere of the different protocols.\n\n170\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.790\nSo I mentioned Bonjour.\n\n171\n00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.120\nThat's one of the big ones.\n\n172\n00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.660\nWe've got, well STP and\nthe functions in IPv6.\n\n173\n00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.200\nAnd then there's DNS also.\n\n174\n00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.490\nYou can do name lookups to find things.\n\n175\n00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.426\nBut that usually assumes that we're giving\nit a name in the first place to find it.\n\n176\n00:07:56.426 --> 00:07:58.643\nNow if you don't see a Mac on your system.\n\n177\n00:07:58.643 --> 00:08:01.265\nThat means your discovery\nprotocols are not working,\n\n178\n00:08:01.265 --> 00:08:04.500\nyou're not finding them out there,\nand what could cause that?\n\n179\n00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.440\nWell usually it's whether or\nnot they're on the same network.\n\n180\n00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.990\nIt could just be patience too.\n\n181\n00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.660\nThe discovery protocols aren't\nrunning 100% of the time.\n\n182\n00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.360\nIt may take it a little while to find it.\n\n183\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.170\nI kind of expected to see Don laptop or\nDon Mac or\n\n184\n00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.850\nwhatever it is that name was a minute ago.\n\n185\n00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.860\nI kind of expected to see the old name,\nbut I don't.\n\n186\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.730\nAnd since I don't see it I might\nhave network connectivity issues.\n\n187\n00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.370\nAnd that's easy enough to test right?\n\n188\n00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.980\nWhen we troubleshoot sharing,\nconnectivity is the base feature.\n\n189\n00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.490\nThat's the thing that\nwe really need to have,\n\n190\n00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.930\ncuz you can't share unless you\ncan talk to the other computer.\n\n191\n00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.456\nSo I can always fire up\nthe network utility and\n\n192\n00:08:38.456 --> 00:08:40.324\nsee if I have that connectivity.\n\n193\n00:08:40.324 --> 00:08:46.980\nSo here I can see my server is\n192.168.0.151, that's my IP address.\n\n194\n00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.047\nAnd if I jump over to my client and\nfire up network utility,\n\n195\n00:08:51.047 --> 00:08:54.706\nI can see that it's 192.168.0.150.\n\n196\n00:08:54.706 --> 00:08:56.065\nThey're on the same network.\n\n197\n00:08:56.065 --> 00:08:59.250\nThey're on the same network, they should\nbe able to see each other, right?\n\n198\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.680\nSo I can use ping to test that out.\n\n199\n00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.103\nI'm gonna try and\nping 192.168.0.151, and I can ping.\n\n200\n00:09:07.103 --> 00:09:10.324\nAnd if I jump over to this guy and\nI go to ping, and\n\n201\n00:09:10.324 --> 00:09:14.928\nI do 192.168.0.150,\nthat was the other guy I think.\n\n202\n00:09:14.928 --> 00:09:16.008\nYep.\n\n203\n00:09:16.008 --> 00:09:18.850\nSo if I go and ping that one,\nit can ping too.\n\n204\n00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.250\nSo why am I not seeing the other system?\n\n205\n00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.740\nWell, this is gonna come\ndown to configuration.\n\n206\n00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.660\nI guess,\nthere's two things that could happen here.\n\n207\n00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.240\nSo one, I could have the firewall\nturned on on one of these and\n\n208\n00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.060\nit's blocking that functionality,\nblocking that discovery.\n\n209\n00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.090\nThe firewall is off by default, these\nare stock installs for the most part, so\n\n210\n00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.600\nI don't believe that's the case,\nbut we can check that real quick.\n\n211\n00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.530\nIf we just jump into our System\nPreferences, and we go into Security &\n\n212\n00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.740\nPrivacy, you can jump to the firewall tab,\nand I see the firewall's off.\n\n213\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.350\nThat's not the problem here.\n\n214\n00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.730\nAnd on this other one I can\njump into the same thing.\n\n215\n00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:52.600\nI can go back,\n\n216\n00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.895\nI can go into Security & Privacy,\nI can go to firewall and it's off too.\n\n217\n00:09:58.985 --> 00:10:02.975\nThe main reason that I'm not seeing this\nsharing working, that it's not sharing it\n\n218\n00:10:02.975 --> 00:10:07.545\nout in the system, is that I'm\nactually not enabling the service yet.\n\n219\n00:10:07.545 --> 00:10:10.732\nSo when I turn this on,\nwhen I turn on DVD or CD sharing,\n\n220\n00:10:10.732 --> 00:10:15.222\nit says this allows users and other\npeople that access this drive remotely,\n\n221\n00:10:15.222 --> 00:10:18.012\ninformation is not encrypted,\nit's just been sent over network.\n\n222\n00:10:18.012 --> 00:10:19.912\nIt's actually using file sharing.\n\n223\n00:10:19.912 --> 00:10:23.782\nAnd file sharing is turned off,\nI haven't turn that on.\n\n224\n00:10:23.782 --> 00:10:28.512\nAnd since none of these other services\nare on, I'm not advertising my services.\n\n225\n00:10:28.512 --> 00:10:31.990\nThe other people don't know that\nI'm running the services yet and so\n\n226\n00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.400\nit doesn't show up.\n\n227\n00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.290\nSo I need to get that set before\nI can move beyond on this.\n\n228\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.150\nNow, I noticed my ask before\nsharing turned itself off.\n\n229\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.680\nLet me reset that.\n\n230\n00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.550\nIt's always a good idea to double check\nyour settings, and make sure they stay.\n\n231\n00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.350\nThere we go.\n\n232\n00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.850\nSometimes the setting might not stay and\nthen you've got a problem, but\n\n233\n00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.560\nthis one is set now.\n\n234\n00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.920\nSo let's look at some\nof these other options.\n\n235\n00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.230\nWell, file sharing.\n\n236\n00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.620\nWe covered file sharing when we talked\nabout file permissions in another episode,\n\n237\n00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.010\nbut this is if I want to share files and\nfolders on my system.\n\n238\n00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.280\nI can come in and I can turn this on, and\n\n239\n00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.830\nnow I'm gonna make my folders available to\nother people that are on the network, and\n\n240\n00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.400\nby default, it's gonna make\nyour public folder available.\n\n241\n00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.000\nSo see how it's doing\nDon Pezet's public folder?\n\n242\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.700\nSo in my user profile,\nif I fire up the Finder, and\n\n243\n00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:21.160\nI go into my home directory, which\ndoesn't actually show up here by default.\n\n244\n00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.820\nYou can add in the settings if you want,\nor\n\n245\n00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.450\nyou can just go up to your menu here and\ngo to Go, and choose your home folder.\n\n246\n00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.020\nAnd when you go to your home folder,\n\n247\n00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.020\nyou'll see that you've got\nthat folder called Public.\n\n248\n00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.000\nWe've talked about it in other episodes.\n\n249\n00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.100\nAnd so\nthat's what's being shared by default.\n\n250\n00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.330\nI can put files here and\npeople can access them and\n\n251\n00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.400\nthey'll have read-only access to it.\n\n252\n00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.610\nOr there's the Dropbox where\nthey can put files in it but\n\n253\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.850\nthey can't read them back out,\nthey can't change them once they're there.\n\n254\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.880\nBut I might wanna have something\na little more like centralized storage.\n\n255\n00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.980\nSo for example, this is my server.\n\n256\n00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.300\nI wanna have a folder here on the server\nthat everybody can use to store data.\n\n257\n00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.310\nSo I could go in My Documents folder for\nexample,\n\n258\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.340\nI might create a folder\ncalled Work Documents.\n\n259\n00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.150\nAnd I want everybody to use this,\nor maybe I call it Central Share.\n\n260\n00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.550\nAnd I tell everybody, hey, for\n\n261\n00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.010\nnow on this is the place that\nI want you to put your data.\n\n262\n00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.980\nEverybody puts their data here.\n\n263\n00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.160\nWell, I can jump back into\nmy system preferences,\n\n264\n00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.630\nI can go into sharing, and\nthis system is called OSX-SERVER01.\n\n265\n00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:31.045\nAnd I'm gonna go to File Sharing and\nI'm gonna add that folder.\n\n266\n00:12:31.045 --> 00:12:35.040\nSo now when I go to add that folder in,\nhere's the Central Share,\n\n267\n00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.180\nright in my documents,\nI'm gonna add that in.\n\n268\n00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.090\nI can now dictate who has access to it.\n\n269\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.250\nAnd we can start to specify that.\n\n270\n00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.485\nNow, notice how it didn't\nappear on my screen.\n\n271\n00:12:43.485 --> 00:12:46.550\nThere's this annoying thing that it\ndoes where it just doesn't seem to\n\n272\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.080\nupdate the screen sometimes.\n\n273\n00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.280\nSo if you hit this bug,\nall you have to do is, go back out and\n\n274\n00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.050\nif you go back into sharing,\nit'll normally just go back up.\n\n275\n00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.020\nLet me just close out of\nSystem Preferences altogether,\n\n276\n00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.440\nand then go back in and it should show up.\n\n277\n00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.550\nIt's kind of an annoying quirk\nthat happens, there we go, and\n\n278\n00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.210\nsee how Central Share shows up now.\n\n279\n00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.050\nIt's just odd behavior that\nhappens from time to time.\n\n280\n00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:09.750\nBut there's the Central Share, and\nnow I can come and set the permissions.\n\n281\n00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.520\nAnd by default I've got read write,\nbut everybody else is read only.\n\n282\n00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.820\nAnd I might wanna come in and assign\ngroups or other people and give them\n\n283\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.120\nthe access to read and write or whatever\nit is that I want them to have access to.\n\n284\n00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.350\nNow the instant that I do that,\nI'm now sharing it on the network.\n\n285\n00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:30.310\nI'm now advertising that I'm a server\nthat has resources people can connect to.\n\n286\n00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.000\nAnd the same thing goes for your client.\n\n287\n00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.362\nThe moment you turn on File Sharing you're\nnow advertising hey, I'm available,\n\n288\n00:13:37.362 --> 00:13:40.056\nyou can connect and\naccess resources on my system.\n\n289\n00:13:40.056 --> 00:13:44.911\nAnd so now when we go into the finder\nyou can jump into the finder and\n\n290\n00:13:44.911 --> 00:13:49.239\nlook at the shared section and\nyou should start to see other\n\n291\n00:13:49.239 --> 00:13:54.010\nsystems on the network like\nthat OSX-SERVER right there.\n\n292\n00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:58.020\nAnd if I click on it I may or\nmay not see any files or folders.\n\n293\n00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.410\nWhen I click on it,\nI'm connecting anonymously.\n\n294\n00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.660\nAnd anonymous users might not\nhave any access to the server.\n\n295\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.670\nSo I need to hit Connect As to tell\nit who I am, who my user account is.\n\n296\n00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:14.160\nSo I might wanna connect as Don Pezet, and\nI can tell it to remember that password so\n\n297\n00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.610\nI don't have to do it every time.\n\n298\n00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:22.010\nAnd, assuming I know my account and\npassword then I should be able to connect.\n\n299\n00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:23.010\nThere we go.\n\n300\n00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.020\nAnd now I start to see the folders and\nright there is the Central Share.\n\n301\n00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.910\nNow, I logged in as an administrator so\nI see my home folder as\n\n302\n00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.130\nwell as the Macintosh HD also,\nyou see more as an administrator.\n\n303\n00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.070\nAs a regular user,\n\n304\n00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.680\nyou would just see Don Pezet's\nPublic Folder and the Central Share.\n\n305\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.490\nBut now I can jump in here and I can start\ncopying files and things in there, so\n\n306\n00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:44.190\nmaybe I wanna copy just a few\nof these files over, so\n\n307\n00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.010\nwe'll copy them, and there we go.\n\n308\n00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.730\nNow I'm copying files\nin that Central Share.\n\n309\n00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:51.580\nSo if I don't wanna use the CD\nsharing piece, I don't have to.\n\n310\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.410\nI could just copy all the files\nright here into a drive.\n\n311\n00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.500\nBut it certainly easier just\nto be able to swap out CDs and\n\n312\n00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.880\nhave those files available or not.\n\n313\n00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.570\nVersus these, where I'd have to\ncopy it and delete them, and\n\n314\n00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.975\ndo all that to keep it updated.\n\n315\n00:15:02.975 --> 00:15:05.010\nThis CD sharing is a little bit easier.\n\n316\n00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.900\nBut now that I'm sharing that\nresource on the network,\n\n317\n00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:12.450\nif I jump over to the server, right there\nunder Shared, I see the OS X client.\n\n318\n00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.140\nIt shows up now,\nbecause it's advertising services,\n\n319\n00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.480\nit's got services that are available.\n\n320\n00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.320\nAnd when I click on that I can connect.\n\n321\n00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.140\nAnd it's gonna ask me to connect.\n\n322\n00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.630\nWe'll see if I do better with\na username and password, there we go.\n\n323\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:29.310\nAnd I can see dpezet, there's my home\nfolder, and so I can browse into it and\n\n324\n00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.330\nstart to access my resources that\nare right there on the network.\n\n325\n00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.850\nSo that's now available, and\nit's present on the system.\n\n326\n00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.310\nYou might have noticed that\nthe CD drive doesn't show up,\n\n327\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.530\nit's not there with my shared folders.\n\n328\n00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.750\nAnd the reason is it,\nit normally shows up under devices.\n\n329\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.950\nAnd I'm not seeing it here.\n\n330\n00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.798\nIf we look at the server under devices,\nI have my own Macintosh HD and that's it.\n\n331\n00:15:46.798 --> 00:15:49.864\nAnd the reason is,\nthat the CD sharing is designed for\n\n332\n00:15:49.864 --> 00:15:52.264\nMACs that don't have their own CD drive.\n\n333\n00:15:52.264 --> 00:15:53.704\nWell, this one does.\n\n334\n00:15:53.704 --> 00:15:55.724\nI know it does if I go\ninto system preferences.\n\n335\n00:15:55.724 --> 00:15:58.055\nI've got the CD and DVD icon right there,\n\n336\n00:15:58.055 --> 00:16:00.770\nwhich lets me know I\nhave an optical drive.\n\n337\n00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.770\nSince I have one, I don't need remote\ndisks, and so they don't show up.\n\n338\n00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.110\nSo I'm not seeing that.\n\n339\n00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.690\nBut let me switch over\nto my actual laptop.\n\n340\n00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.770\nSo this is my laptop, my MacBook Pro and\nI don't have an optical drive and so\n\n341\n00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.190\nwhen I go into my finder,\nI'll just bring that up.\n\n342\n00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:18.550\nWhen I look in my finder over here on\ndevices, normally you see your own I got\n\n343\n00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:24.055\nto turn it on, I see my computer, I see\nmy Macintosh HD and I see Remote Disc.\n\n344\n00:16:24.055 --> 00:16:27.725\nI can choose Remote Disc to connect to\npeople that are sharing their disc on\n\n345\n00:16:27.725 --> 00:16:31.705\nthe network and\nright there is OSX-CLIENT01.\n\n346\n00:16:31.705 --> 00:16:35.265\nThat's the machine we shared it out and\nI can double click on that.\n\n347\n00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:39.338\nAnd because it shared out on the not\ncenter required permissions I see the cd\n\n348\n00:16:39.338 --> 00:16:43.408\ndrive right there and it's got those\ncentral S disk inserted in the drive,\n\n349\n00:16:43.408 --> 00:16:47.887\nI can browse into it and I can sort to\naccess those resources of the slowly.\n\n350\n00:16:47.887 --> 00:16:48.588\nThere you go.\n\n351\n00:16:48.588 --> 00:16:49.747\nAnd I can browse and see it.\n\n352\n00:16:49.747 --> 00:16:50.427\nAll right.\n\n353\n00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:54.099\nIf we'd set it and required\na password then back on this screen,\n\n354\n00:16:54.099 --> 00:16:56.790\nI would have to click the request access.\n\n355\n00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.810\nAnd on the MAC,\nwe'd get a little pop up that would say,\n\n356\n00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.430\ndo you wanna allow this person,\nyou can allow them in or not, right.\n\n357\n00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.830\nBut this is a great way to make an optical\ndisc available to machines that don't\n\n358\n00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:05.860\nnormally have it.\n\n359\n00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.450\nAnd notice once I access it,\nit's mounted and now my MAC\n\n360\n00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:13.430\nthinks that I has an optical drive It\nshows up like an optical disc right there.\n\n361\n00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.990\nSo it's a different kind of file\nsharing from the regular folder\n\n362\n00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.650\nsharing that we see.\n\n363\n00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:21.210\nAll right so\nthose are a couple of things we can share.\n\n364\n00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.190\nWe saw file sharing, we saw CD and\n\n365\n00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.670\nDVD sharing, there's a lot of\nother things we can share too.\n\n366\n00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.730\nIf I go back into my\nsystem preferences and\n\n367\n00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:34.240\ntake a look at the other share options,\nthe next one is screen sharing.\n\n368\n00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.150\nNow we talked a little bit about screen\nsharing when we talked about back to my\n\n369\n00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.170\nMac in the iCloud episode.\n\n370\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.540\nBut you don't have to have\niCloud to use screen sharing.\n\n371\n00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.570\nWhen you turn on screen sharing,\nit adds the option for\n\n372\n00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.400\nother people to see your screen.\n\n373\n00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.340\nMacs can do it natively.\n\n374\n00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.615\nLinux and Windows machines can do it with\nany VNC compatible client out there.\n\n375\n00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.605\nThey can just go and\ndownload one and they can use it.\n\n376\n00:17:55.605 --> 00:17:59.425\nSo when you turn on screen sharing on\nthe Mac side we can use user accounts.\n\n377\n00:17:59.425 --> 00:18:01.525\nAnd so you'll see it's set to\nAdministrator's by default.\n\n378\n00:18:01.525 --> 00:18:03.645\nI can add myself in if I wanted.\n\n379\n00:18:03.645 --> 00:18:07.047\nOnce that's done,\nI could jump over to another Mac.\n\n380\n00:18:07.047 --> 00:18:09.097\nSo I'll take this one for example.\n\n381\n00:18:09.097 --> 00:18:12.187\nAnd if you use your go menu up top,\nwell, there's two ways to do it.\n\n382\n00:18:12.187 --> 00:18:13.427\nI usually use the go menu.\n\n383\n00:18:13.427 --> 00:18:15.687\nBut let's save that one cuz\nthat one's the harder way.\n\n384\n00:18:15.687 --> 00:18:21.147\nIf you browse to your finder, and you find\nthat client on the network, if screen\n\n385\n00:18:21.147 --> 00:18:24.627\nsharing is turned on, you'll get a second\nbutton right here called share screen.\n\n386\n00:18:24.627 --> 00:18:27.860\nAnd you could just hit share screen and\nit'll connect and\n\n387\n00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.750\nit will show you that desktop.\n\n388\n00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.250\nI'm authorized,\nI've got the right username and\n\n389\n00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.430\npassword I'm able to connect and\nnow I can see that desktop, all right.\n\n390\n00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.870\nIf I didn't have the right username and\npassword I wouldn't be able to connect and\n\n391\n00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.540\nI'd be kicked out or just prompt me for\nusername and password.\n\n392\n00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.210\nBut I'm connected now I can\nremotely see that screen.\n\n393\n00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:46.310\nI didn't need back to my mac,\nI didn't need iCloud.\n\n394\n00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.690\nThis is just done natively\nbetween the systems and\n\n395\n00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.640\nin fact if I jump over to\nlike a windows machine.\n\n396\n00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.780\nOn a Windows machine, if you install a VNC\nviewer, like I've got TightVNC installed,\n\n397\n00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.530\nyou can type in the IP address of\nthe Mac that you want to connect to and\n\n398\n00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:01.590\nyou can connect.\n\n399\n00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:05.075\nThe only problem is that VNC doesn't\nuse usernames and passwords by default.\n\n400\n00:19:05.075 --> 00:19:07.565\nNormally it just uses a password, so\n\n401\n00:19:07.565 --> 00:19:10.775\nwe have to change one extra\nsetting here on our client.\n\n402\n00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:14.495\nIf I want to connect to this client,\nI need to turn on screen sharing and\n\n403\n00:19:14.495 --> 00:19:17.245\nI need to go to the computer\nsettings right here and\n\n404\n00:19:17.245 --> 00:19:20.505\nunder computer settings,\nthis is where you can enable VNC viewers,\n\n405\n00:19:20.505 --> 00:19:23.615\nthis is if you want to allow Linux and\nWindows machines to connect and\n\n406\n00:19:23.615 --> 00:19:26.960\nyou put the password they're\ngoing to use to connect.\n\n407\n00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.570\nAll right.\nIt's not a username and password,\n\n408\n00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.540\nit's just a straight up password.\n\n409\n00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.810\nNow they will still have to\nhave a username and password.\n\n410\n00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.820\nLet me show you.\n\n411\n00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.210\nSo on this Windows machine I'm gonna\npunch in the IP address of that Mac and\n\n412\n00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.800\nI'm gonna connect and\nit's gonna prompt me for the VNC password.\n\n413\n00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.710\nSo I'll put that in and\nonce I specify it's gonna connect and\n\n414\n00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.460\nI'm going to see the screen\non the other machine.\n\n415\n00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.410\nBut, it's locked.\n\n416\n00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.940\nIt locked the screen.\n\n417\n00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.150\nIf I go and look at my Mac,\nit's not locked, right?\n\n418\n00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.470\nWhat's going on there?\n\n419\n00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.590\nWell, the VNC connection is not allowed to\njust walk right through the doors, right?\n\n420\n00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.570\nIt still has to authenticate.\n\n421\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.140\nAnd so back here,\neven though I have the VNC password,\n\n422\n00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.060\nI do still have to have\na valid user account.\n\n423\n00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.850\nAnd so\nI'll punch in the valid user account.\n\n424\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.100\nAnd now it's gonna connect and\nI see the actual desktop.\n\n425\n00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.440\nSo if I launch Safari, so\nhere Safari comes up and\n\n426\n00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.200\nI'll browse to maybe Apple's website.\n\n427\n00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.500\nSo I'm gonna browse to Apple's website.\n\n428\n00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.280\nIf I switch back to that machine,\nthere's Safari.\n\n429\n00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.240\nI'm seeing the same desktop even though\nthe lock screen is not represented that\n\n430\n00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.450\nway the desktop is.\n\n431\n00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.600\nIt's the same desktop that we're seeing.\n\n432\n00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.970\nAnd I'm now able to share it.\n\n433\n00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.640\nSo that screen sharing\nworks across platform.\n\n434\n00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.830\nIt's just VNC, Virtual Network Computing.\n\n435\n00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:40.244\nIt's a standard, it was actually\ncreated by some guys at the Bell AT&T\n\n436\n00:20:40.244 --> 00:20:42.930\nlaboratories but\nit's been distributed pretty widely.\n\n437\n00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.560\nThere's a lot of people that use it.\n\n438\n00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.110\nAnd it's built into Mac Pro labs.\n\n439\n00:20:47.692 --> 00:20:50.850\nAll right, let's see what else can we\nshare on our sharing adventure here.\n\n440\n00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.730\nSo if I go back into\nmy system preferences.\n\n441\n00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.820\nWe talked about CD and DVD drives,\nwe talked about file sharing,\n\n442\n00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.082\nwe talked about screen sharing.\n\n443\n00:20:59.082 --> 00:21:01.270\nWe've also, I'm on the wrong system,\nhere we go.\n\n444\n00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.170\nWe've also got printer sharing.\n\n445\n00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.930\nIf I've got a printer on my network,\nI can share it with other people.\n\n446\n00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:10.270\nNow today, most people buy printers and\ntheir directly on the network.\n\n447\n00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.800\nAnd so\nyou can just connect directly to it.\n\n448\n00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.430\nYou don't need it tied to a Mac.\n\n449\n00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.430\nBut if you had an older printer\nthat's just USB, for example.\n\n450\n00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.155\nYou could plug the USB\nprinter into your system.\n\n451\n00:21:19.155 --> 00:21:20.245\nAnd then share it on the network.\n\n452\n00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:22.325\nAnd then other people can connect to it,\n\n453\n00:21:22.325 --> 00:21:24.405\neven though that printer's\nnot really enabled.\n\n454\n00:21:24.405 --> 00:21:26.835\nYour machine makes it network enabled.\n\n455\n00:21:26.835 --> 00:21:29.755\nSo I don't have a printer on this client,\nbut on my server I do.\n\n456\n00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:33.855\nSo if I go back to my server, and\nI go into system preferences and\n\n457\n00:21:33.855 --> 00:21:37.685\nprinters, I can see where I've\ngot our studio printer added.\n\n458\n00:21:37.685 --> 00:21:41.090\nSo here's the studio printer,\nit's an HP Laserjet 400,\n\n459\n00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:43.990\nthis server is connected to that printer.\n\n460\n00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.810\nWe'll say that printer is USB, so\nit's plugged directly into my server.\n\n461\n00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.400\nThe client can't get to that printer,\nbecause USB is not a shared medium, but\n\n462\n00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.750\nour server can share it out.\n\n463\n00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:59.980\nIf we go back into the sharing system\npreference, and we go into printer\n\n464\n00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.210\nsharing we can pick any printer that we've\ngot and we can share it on the network.\n\n465\n00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.050\nAnd we can specify whether\npeople can print to it or not.\n\n466\n00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.410\nYou can require username and\npassword if you want.\n\n467\n00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:12.470\nThe default is that everyone who\ncan see it is allowed to print.\n\n468\n00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:13.730\nBut you might want to change that.\n\n469\n00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.110\nYou can add individual people and\nthen set this one to no access.\n\n470\n00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.630\nAnd now you get into specific people.\n\n471\n00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.440\nI'll just leave it open here, so anybody\nwho can see this will be able to print.\n\n472\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:27.810\nSo now when I go back to my work station,\nthis work station doesn't have a printer.\n\n473\n00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:33.146\nBut if I go to my printer options,\nwhich are buried right here.\n\n474\n00:22:33.146 --> 00:22:38.200\nAnd I go to add a printer,\nit's gonna scan.\n\n475\n00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.960\nAnd right there I can see\nstudio printer at OSX-SERVER01.\n\n476\n00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.350\nIt's seeing it on the server to\nshowing up as Bonjour Service and\n\n477\n00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:53.700\nnow I can connect and I can use that\nprinter by going through the server.\n\n478\n00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.750\nNow the problem here is what if\nsomebody turns the server off?\n\n479\n00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.780\nIf I go and power the server off,\n\n480\n00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.370\nI lose connection to the printer cuz\nthe printer was plugged into it.\n\n481\n00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:03.850\nThat's why so many people buy\nnetwork printers these days.\n\n482\n00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.090\nNetwork printers that have wireless or\nwired connections,\n\n483\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.230\nthose are a lot more reliable, cuz they\ndon't depend on a work station running.\n\n484\n00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.610\nBut if you have an older printer,\nyou can plug it right into a server,\n\n485\n00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.340\nyou can share it out, and\nnow we've got quick and easy access to it.\n\n486\n00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.300\nNow, I treat it just like\na directly plugged in printer.\n\n487\n00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.650\nAnd I can print to it, and off I go.\n\n488\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:20.490\nWe lose little things.\n\n489\n00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.590\nLike you might have noticed on\nthe server how it had the right icon,\n\n490\n00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:23.780\nthe icon that looked like my printer.\n\n491\n00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.120\nIt's a black printer.\n\n492\n00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.670\nBut now since it's over the network\nwe can't really identify it that way.\n\n493\n00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.630\nAnd so it just shows a generic\npicture of a printer.\n\n494\n00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.560\nAll right,\nsome of the other sharing that we've got.\n\n495\n00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.230\nIf we dig in, that was printer sharing.\n\n496\n00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:36.700\nWe've got remote login.\n\n497\n00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.930\nNow what the heck if remote login?\n\n498\n00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.831\nWell, OS X has a very pretty\ngraphical user interface, right?\n\n499\n00:23:42.831 --> 00:23:46.955\nWe can use it, it's very simple,\neverything that we need is right there in\n\n500\n00:23:46.955 --> 00:23:49.586\nthe GUI, but\nunder the hood it's running BSD.\n\n501\n00:23:49.586 --> 00:23:51.629\nAnd BSD is a flavor of UNIX.\n\n502\n00:23:51.629 --> 00:23:54.903\nAnd UNIX is powered by a command line.\n\n503\n00:23:54.903 --> 00:23:56.369\nIt is a command line environment.\n\n504\n00:23:56.369 --> 00:23:58.989\nDeep down under the hood\nthat's what UNIX is and\n\n505\n00:23:58.989 --> 00:24:02.940\nwe can make it where people can\naccess that command line remotely.\n\n506\n00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.660\nYou can access it right here in your own\nmachine, I can just run the terminal and\n\n507\n00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.420\nwhen I run the terminal, here I am.\n\n508\n00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.830\nI'm in the UNIX environment.\n\n509\n00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.080\nI can run UNIX commands.\n\n510\n00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.264\nAnd I can see it.\nAnd so, when I run uname-a,\n\n511\n00:24:15.264 --> 00:24:20.400\nuname-a is UNIX command that tells us\nwhat operating system we're running.\n\n512\n00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.948\nAnd when it comes back it tells me,\nnot that I'm running OS X,\n\n513\n00:24:23.948 --> 00:24:26.146\nit tells me that I'm running Darwin.\n\n514\n00:24:26.146 --> 00:24:27.710\nWhat the heck is Darwin?\n\n515\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:32.240\nWell, Darwin is the UNIX kernel,\nthe BSD kernel is running under the hood,\n\n516\n00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.650\nthe Darwin OS.\n\n517\n00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.180\nSo OS X is actually Darwin.\n\n518\n00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:41.420\nBut OS X adds all the GUI environment and\nstuff on top of that so I can see it.\n\n519\n00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.820\nI can now start to work as if\nI were in a UNIX environment.\n\n520\n00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:50.140\nI can issue all the UNIX commands that I\nmay or may not use on a regular basis,\n\n521\n00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.330\nthings like top, and\nnow I can view performance, and so on.\n\n522\n00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.470\nIt's for UNIX.\n\n523\n00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:59.050\nWell, if I wanna remotely manage\na system using UNIX technologies,\n\n524\n00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.810\nthat's what remote login does.\n\n525\n00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:02.650\nSo when we go to turn on\nthis sharing option for\n\n526\n00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:06.040\nremote login,\nit's going to enable people to use SSH,\n\n527\n00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.080\nthe Secure Shell protocol to get\nan encrypted terminal on my system.\n\n528\n00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.840\nOr to use SFTP, the Secure File Transfer\nProtocol, so I can copy files back and\n\n529\n00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.940\nforth encrypted.\n\n530\n00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.170\nWhen you turn on file sharing,\nfile sharing, I know I talked about it in\n\n531\n00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:25.140\nthe other episode but just to recap it,\nit uses AFP, the Apple File Protocol,\n\n532\n00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.910\nor SMB, Server Message Block which is\na part of Microsoft's technologies.\n\n533\n00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.090\nSo it uses those two protocols.\n\n534\n00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:34.500\nIt also has support for NFS, the Network\nFile System, that's the UNIX file sharing.\n\n535\n00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.750\nBut those are the three\nmain ones by default.\n\n536\n00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:41.380\nBut FTP, File Transfer Protocol,\nthat's one that works everywhere.\n\n537\n00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.320\nBut it's not encrypted.\n\n538\n00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.990\nIt's weak, and so\nthat's why it's not a default option.\n\n539\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.020\nBut when I turn on remote login,\nit turns on SFTP.\n\n540\n00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.418\nThat's file transfer protocol over SSH.\n\n541\n00:25:50.418 --> 00:25:52.100\nIt's encrypted and it's secure.\n\n542\n00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.240\nIt's a very reliable\nway to transfer files.\n\n543\n00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.470\nOur regular end user is\nnever going to need it.\n\n544\n00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:00.690\nBut if you're administering a thousand\nMacs and you wanted to put an application\n\n545\n00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:04.790\non a thousand Macs, you can write a script\nthat creates a secure encrypted tunnel\n\n546\n00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:07.610\nto every one of them and drops\nan application in the application folder.\n\n547\n00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:09.100\nAnd you can have it set permissions,\ndo other things.\n\n548\n00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.770\nYou can really do some cool stuff.\n\n549\n00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.130\nIf you're using Apple remote desktop,\n\n550\n00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:16.070\nApple Remote Desktop can connect to\nrun UNIX commands on these systems,\n\n551\n00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.170\nit needs this permission to\nbe able to connect and run.\n\n552\n00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:20.390\nSo I'm gonna turn that on.\n\n553\n00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.098\nI'm gonna turn on remote login.\n\n554\n00:26:22.098 --> 00:26:24.400\nAnd when I turn it on,\nI can specify who's allowed to use it.\n\n555\n00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.328\nThe default is only administrators,\nyou probably wanna leave it that way.\n\n556\n00:26:27.328 --> 00:26:31.378\nYou probably don't want your regular\nusers reaching out and connecting to it.\n\n557\n00:26:31.378 --> 00:26:33.120\nAnd then,\nit's telling me here how I can connect.\n\n558\n00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.240\nIf I wanna connect,\nhere's the command that I need to run.\n\n559\n00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.780\nSSH, followed by my username, @,\n\n560\n00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.940\nfollowed by the IP address of\nthe station I'm connecting to.\n\n561\n00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:47.510\nSo if I jump over to my server, and\n\n562\n00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:53.560\ndrop to a terminal, in the terminal,\nI'm normally connected to my own machine.\n\n563\n00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.660\nSo on this server,\nwhen I drop to a terminal,\n\n564\n00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:59.080\nsee how it says OSX-SERVER01,\nI'm on this machine.\n\n565\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.475\nAnd if I run the hostname command,\nI'm on OSX-SERVER01.local.\n\n566\n00:27:03.475 --> 00:27:06.235\nBut if I run ssh dpezet@192.168.0.150,\n\n567\n00:27:06.235 --> 00:27:11.945\nI'm gonna open up a secure\nshell to that other machine.\n\n568\n00:27:11.945 --> 00:27:14.585\nAnd it's gonna send me a certificate\nthat I can use to encrypt data.\n\n569\n00:27:14.585 --> 00:27:17.205\nAnd I'm gonna say that I trust it,\nso I'll say yes.\n\n570\n00:27:17.205 --> 00:27:19.635\nAnd now it's asking for my password.\n\n571\n00:27:19.635 --> 00:27:22.660\nSo I'll punch in my password,\nthe password for dpezet.\n\n572\n00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:26.520\nNow, I'm connected to OSX-CLIENT01 and\n\n573\n00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:30.040\nwhen I run commands there actually\nrunning on the other machine\n\n574\n00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.520\nthat are running on this machine they\nare running on the other machine.\n\n575\n00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.800\nI know have the secure shallow connection\nopen and start to execute programs and\n\n576\n00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.620\nscripts and things like that.\n\n577\n00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.420\nNow, this is a security vulnerability.\n\n578\n00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.790\nIf somebody gets my password,\nthey can remotely connect and\n\n579\n00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:43.450\nstart to mess with it.\n\n580\n00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.160\nSo I've gotta be careful with that,\nand you can leverage firewalls and\n\n581\n00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.490\nthings to protect you and\nensure that doesn't happen.\n\n582\n00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.450\nBut the best security here is to make\nsure you keep your password safe.\n\n583\n00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.960\nAnd that you don't let those get out.\n\n584\n00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.520\nSo this is off by default.\n\n585\n00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.500\nYou can turn it on, and\nnow you can remotely connect.\n\n586\n00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.084\nWe do it with some of our Mac Minis here,\n\n587\n00:27:58.084 --> 00:28:00.788\nour studio Mac Minis cuz we have\nscripts that run remotely on them.\n\n588\n00:28:00.788 --> 00:28:02.228\nAnd we turn this functionality on.\n\n589\n00:28:05.098 --> 00:28:07.670\nThe next one in line is Remote Management.\n\n590\n00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.860\nNow, I mentioned Apple Remote Desktop\njust a second ago.\n\n591\n00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.390\nApple Remote Desktop is a pretty,\nsweet utility that's set centrally on your\n\n592\n00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.760\nnetwork and let's you remotely\nconnect out and manage systems.\n\n593\n00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.490\nAnd it uses remote login, but\nit also uses Remote Management.\n\n594\n00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:24.900\nThis piece,\nif I wanna use Apple Remote Desktop,\n\n595\n00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.140\nI've gotta have this one turned on.\n\n596\n00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.360\nNow, I wanna show you guys Apple Remote\nDesktop and give you kind of a view\n\n597\n00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.150\nof how it works as a really neat\nutility if you've never seen it.\n\n598\n00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:36.010\nAnd it leverages a lot of the other\nthings that we've seen here.\n\n599\n00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:37.520\nBut I'm looking at the clock there.\n\n600\n00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.650\nI know I'm running short of time.\n\n601\n00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.550\nSo I don't think I can do it justice\nin the two minutes that I have left.\n\n602\n00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:45.080\nSo let's set that one aside and\nwe'll tackle that in part two.\n\n603\n00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.950\nWe will come back and visit that one.\n\n604\n00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.520\nThe last two are pretty easy though so\nlet me cover this last two and\n\n605\n00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.980\nwe will catch Apple Remote Desktop\nin the next one.\n\n606\n00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.940\nSo I've got Remote Apple Events,\nwhat the heck is that one?\n\n607\n00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.572\nWell, if you use the automator,\n\n608\n00:28:57.572 --> 00:29:01.366\nin the automator you can create various\nautomation activities that are Apple\n\n609\n00:29:01.366 --> 00:29:04.128\nevents that you can cause to\nexecute on other machines.\n\n610\n00:29:04.128 --> 00:29:07.894\nSo very similar to Remote Login where have\nshallows that can run like scripts, here,\n\n611\n00:29:07.894 --> 00:29:10.440\nI can do with automator or\nother Apple Software.\n\n612\n00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.510\nSo if I wanna allow Remote Apple Events,\nI can turn this on.\n\n613\n00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:18.300\nAnd now, other OS X computers will be able\nto send Apple Events to this machine.\n\n614\n00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.370\nWe can actually get logging\nto go this way too,\n\n615\n00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.760\nif you've got like\na centralized console screen.\n\n616\n00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.390\nYou can get a lot of different things to\npush over this, it's kind of up to you.\n\n617\n00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.038\nYou just have to turn that on.\n\n618\n00:29:28.038 --> 00:29:30.469\nAnd the last one was probably\nthe least used of all of these and\n\n619\n00:29:30.469 --> 00:29:32.440\nthat's Internet Sharing.\n\n620\n00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.460\nBack in the day, an Internet connection\nwas not a terribly common thing.\n\n621\n00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.810\nAnd when you had it, it was usually\na modem in one computer, and\n\n622\n00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:40.660\nit would dial up and connect.\n\n623\n00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.920\nWell, if I had five computers and\nI wanted all of them to get out,\n\n624\n00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.630\nI didn't wanna get five modems and\nfive phone lines.\n\n625\n00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:47.450\nSo you could have one\ncomputer dial out and\n\n626\n00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.400\nit could share its connection with\nthe other computers on the network.\n\n627\n00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.820\nOn today's world, you normally get like a\nwireless router, a wireless access point,\n\n628\n00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:58.410\nan Apple AirPort, something like that,\nand it does the Internet sharing for you.\n\n629\n00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:02.040\nBut there are some scenarios\nwhere you might still want it.\n\n630\n00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.920\nYou can turn that on in OS X.\n\n631\n00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.660\nAnd you can say,\nI've got an Internet connection,\n\n632\n00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.400\nI wanna share it with the other\npeople on my network.\n\n633\n00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.280\nAnd we just turn it on right here\nby turning on Internet Sharing.\n\n634\n00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.630\nNow, it only works if\nyou have two adapters.\n\n635\n00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.620\nI've only got one adapter so\nI can't really turn it on.\n\n636\n00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.780\nI'm telling you here which connection\nof mine is my Internet connection.\n\n637\n00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.198\nWell, I've only got an Ethernet jack and\nthat's it.\n\n638\n00:30:24.198 --> 00:30:28.326\nAnd then, which connection are my\ncomputers on and I would specify that.\n\n639\n00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:31.584\nLet me show you on my actual laptop.\n\n640\n00:30:31.584 --> 00:30:32.959\nSo if I go into my sharing,\n\n641\n00:30:32.959 --> 00:30:35.969\nbecause I do have multiple\nnetwork adapters on this one.\n\n642\n00:30:35.969 --> 00:30:39.520\nSo if I go into my Sharing, and\nI go under Internet Sharing,\n\n643\n00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.990\nyou'll see over here where I can say\nwho's my Internet connection and\n\n644\n00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.540\nhow do I wanna share it with people.\n\n645\n00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.990\nAnd look at some of the options.\n\n646\n00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.380\nI can say that my Internet connection\nis on my Thunderbolt Ethernet or\n\n647\n00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.720\nit's on my Wi-Fi or\non one of these other connections and\n\n648\n00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.420\nthen I can share it to people\nusing Bluetooth if I want.\n\n649\n00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.680\nI can add people Bluetooth\ntablet to my laptop and\n\n650\n00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.330\nget Internet access via\nmy wireless network.\n\n651\n00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.095\nThis is something that we use on,\n\n652\n00:31:03.095 --> 00:31:06.800\n[LAUGH] this is not necessarily\nthe fairest way to use it.\n\n653\n00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.760\nBut let's say you're on the airplane and\nyou need the gogo in-flight Internet.\n\n654\n00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.625\nSo you paid the money so you can get\nInternet access on your laptop and\n\n655\n00:31:12.625 --> 00:31:13.538\nit's using Wi-Fi.\n\n656\n00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:15.538\nBut then you get your cellphone and\nyour tablet, and\n\n657\n00:31:15.538 --> 00:31:18.510\nyou want them to have Internet access too,\nyou don't wanna pay three times.\n\n658\n00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.860\nWell, you could share your Internet\nconnection over Bluetooth.\n\n659\n00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.410\nAnd your phone and\nyour tablet could connect up.\n\n660\n00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.920\nAnd now they're using your laptop to\nbe able to get out to the Internet.\n\n661\n00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.810\nSo you're sharing that\nconnection between them.\n\n662\n00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:30.660\nI know I've done that with hotel,\nwireless before.\n\n663\n00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.630\nI didn't wanna have to\nactually multiple devices.\n\n664\n00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:34.560\nYou can share right there.\n\n665\n00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.450\nSo there's several different uses for it.\n\n666\n00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:41.090\nAnd because this laptop has Bluetooth,\nI see one more item Bluetooth sharing.\n\n667\n00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:42.410\nThere's Bluetooth sharing, I picked that.\n\n668\n00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:47.180\nRemember, I said that you only see\nitems that match up with your hardware.\n\n669\n00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.560\nSo I have Bluetooth sharing here,\nI don't have CD and\n\n670\n00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:53.000\nDVD sharing cuz I don't have a CD or\nDVD drive.\n\n671\n00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.450\nBut I do have Bluetooth.\n\n672\n00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:58.830\nWhen I looked at my workstation over here,\nit has CD and DVD sharing, but\n\n673\n00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.930\nit doesn't have Bluetooth cuz\nit's a virtual machine, and\n\n674\n00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.710\nit doesn't have a Bluetooth receiver and\ntransmitter.\n\n675\n00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:08.498\nSo you only see the sharing options that\nmatch up with the hardware that you have.\n\n676\n00:32:08.498 --> 00:32:11.678\nWell, that's a pretty good run down of\neach of the different sharing options and\n\n677\n00:32:11.678 --> 00:32:13.190\nwhat they do and how they work.\n\n678\n00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.928\nThere's a little more I\nwanna talk about though.\n\n679\n00:32:14.928 --> 00:32:16.680\nI definitely wanna hit on\nApple Remote Desktop, and\n\n680\n00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.830\nI wanna talk about some of the other\ncommand line ways that we can\n\n681\n00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:22.420\nconnect to network shares cuz\nthey do turn up on the exam.\n\n682\n00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.740\nSo a few more things to cover\nbefore we wrap this one up, but for\n\n683\n00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.890\nnow this is a good spot for\nus to stop this episode.\n\n684\n00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:31.110\nSo definitely tune back in for\npart two, but in this episode we\n\n685\n00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:34.390\ngot a chance to see a good run down\nof all the sharing technologies,\n\n686\n00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.860\neach of the ones are available as far\nas sharing files, folders, CDs and\n\n687\n00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:42.430\nDVDs, printers, Internet connections,\nall those different bells and whistles.\n\n688\n00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:44.390\nWhich we'll just keep\nrolling in the next part.\n\n689\n00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:49.504\nSo for now, signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet, and I'll see you next time.\n\n690\n00:32:49.504 --> 00:32:57.040\n[SOUND]\n\n",

another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n4\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.129\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back again with\nmore Apple technology coming at you live\n\n5\n00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:22.603\nfrom the ITProTV studio two.\n\n6\n00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:25.383\nIn this episode we're going to\nbe continuing on with well,\n\n7\n00:00:25.383 --> 00:00:28.790\nsharing resources, right, I was\ntalking about it in the last episode.\n\n8\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.650\nWe went through all the different\nsharing options on a Mac we can use\n\n9\n00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.989\nto make resources available.\n\n10\n00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.293\nBut there were a few things I didn't get\nto that I wanted to spend some time on.\n\n11\n00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:39.311\nThe big one that I left off\non was Apple Remote Desktop,\n\n12\n00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:44.030\nthat one of the sharing items we had that\nwe could turn on was remote management.\n\n13\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.010\nThat would allow one Mac to\ncontrol another Mac, and for\n\n14\n00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.239\na home user that's not terribly useful.\n\n15\n00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.704\nBut in an enterprise,\nif you've got 1,000 Macs out there,\n\n16\n00:00:52.704 --> 00:00:56.830\nwouldn't it be nice to have one central\nplace to go to manage all of them?\n\n17\n00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.407\nIf you wanted to roll out a new\napplication that you could deploy it from\n\n18\n00:00:59.407 --> 00:01:01.560\none central space, wouldn't that be nice?\n\n19\n00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.830\nIt certainly would and\nApple Remote Desktop does that.\n\n20\n00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.240\nNow first thing I want to mention about\nApple Remote Desktop is it's not free.\n\n21\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.310\nIt's not built into the operating system,\nyou actually have to buy it, but\n\n22\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.400\nit's really inexpensive.\n\n23\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.160\nAs a home user, it's not inexpensive,\nit's $80 in the App Store.\n\n24\n00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.760\nAnd so you might say, $80, that's crazy.\n\n25\n00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.780\nBut when you can manage 1,000\nmachines with it, it pays for\n\n26\n00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.460\nitself the first time you use it.\n\n27\n00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.910\nSo if you were to compare this to\nManagement Utilities in the Windows world,\n\n28\n00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.400\nthis is astronomically cheaper,\nit's really amazing.\n\n29\n00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.590\nSo it's a great product and\nit's super easy to use, so\n\n30\n00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.680\nlet me show you how it works,\nI'm gonna start here on my client.\n\n31\n00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.420\nAnd on my client, if I want this client\nto be managed by Apple Remote Desktop,\n\n32\n00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.070\nI've got to go into my system\npreferences and go into sharing.\n\n33\n00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.740\nAnd the option I need to turn on is\nthis guy right here, Remote Management.\n\n34\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.680\nNow, what that's gong to allow,\n\n35\n00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.510\nis a central station running Apple Remote\nDesktop to take over this machine.\n\n36\n00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.750\nAnd when it does,\n\n37\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.020\nit's going to take over some of the other\nfeatures like Screen Sharing, okay.\n\n38\n00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.137\nWatch what happens when I turn this on.\n\n39\n00:01:59.137 --> 00:02:02.505\nSo I'm going to come in here and\ngo into Computer Settings and\n\n40\n00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:06.020\nwe've got, sorry I don't need\nto go to Computer Settings.\n\n41\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.100\nI need to just to turn it on,\nthat's all I need to do, there we go.\n\n42\n00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.995\nWhen I turn it on that's\nwhat I was looking for\n\n43\n00:02:10.995 --> 00:02:14.950\n[LAUGH] it's gonna ask me what I'm going\nto allow Apple Remote Desktop to do.\n\n44\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.843\nAnd you'll see the first one Observe,\n\n45\n00:02:16.843 --> 00:02:19.891\ndo I wanna allow that software\nsuit to view my screen remotely?\n\n46\n00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:24.810\nWell, I do and\nthat's gonna replace Screen Sharing.\n\n47\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.620\nSo, Screen Sharing is gonna get disabled,\nbecause I'm turning these on, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.538\nSo, I'm gonna allow my system to be\nremotely controlled, or observed.\n\n49\n00:02:32.538 --> 00:02:36.460\nIf I just turn it on like this,\nApple Remote Desktop can view my screen,\n\n50\n00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.410\nand that's it.\n\n51\n00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.248\nAnd whenever they view it I'm\ngoing to get really nothing,\n\n52\n00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:43.731\nI don't see that it's happening it's\nkind of invisible to me, right.\n\n53\n00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:45.094\nI can turn on Control and\n\n54\n00:02:45.094 --> 00:02:49.400\nnow when they connect they can actually\ncontrol the mouse, they can type.\n\n55\n00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.320\nWhoever's remotely managing\nmy system can use my system.\n\n56\n00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.370\nIt's great for help desks, right?\n\n57\n00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.030\nIt's easier to do something than to try to\nwalk somebody through it over the phone,\n\n58\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.610\nso now we can actually do it.\n\n59\n00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.450\nAnd then show when being observed,\nsee how that wasn't checked by default?\n\n60\n00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.220\nIf somebody remotely views my screen\nI won't even know it's happening,\n\n61\n00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.350\nit's invisible to me.\n\n62\n00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.210\nBut if I turn that on,\nnow I'll get a little pop-up bubble,\n\n63\n00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.240\nit'll let me know if somebody\nis viewing my screen.\n\n64\n00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.390\nSo I may or may not want that,\nyou can turn it on in control here.\n\n65\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.960\nSome of the other things,\ngenerate reports.\n\n66\n00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.500\nDo I wanna allow Apple Remote Desktop\nto generate a hardware and\n\n67\n00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.310\nsoftware report on my system?\n\n68\n00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.900\nPeople might want to manage and make sure\nthat all the systems are up to date.\n\n69\n00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.070\nARD can do that if we've got\nGenerate reports turned on.\n\n70\n00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.916\nOpen and quit applications, ARD can\nactually launch and close programs.\n\n71\n00:03:34.916 --> 00:03:38.250\nSo if help desk is monitoring my system\nand they see a program is going crazy,\n\n72\n00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.375\nthey can kill it off and that'll free up\nCPU on my system will get working again.\n\n73\n00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:45.470\nOr they can launch a program, if they've\ngot a remote script they want to run to\n\n74\n00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.690\nperform some act and\nmaybe backup my system, they can run that.\n\n75\n00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.169\nThey can change my system preferences,\ndelete and replace files.\n\n76\n00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.290\nIt says items, but it's really talking\nabout files, so it can copy stuff.\n\n77\n00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.470\nIf they want to install an application,\nthey can just copy it right to my system.\n\n78\n00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.770\nThey can do a text chat, so\nmaybe I don't want to call on the phone.\n\n79\n00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.603\nBut Help Desk can open up\na chat session with me and\n\n80\n00:04:05.603 --> 00:04:07.455\ntalk to me while they're\nworking on the system.\n\n81\n00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:11.910\nRestart and shut down the machines,\nand then just straight up Copy files.\n\n82\n00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.230\nWe have delete and replace up here, but\nthis is copy, so creating something new.\n\n83\n00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.855\nThese are all different things that Apple\nRemote Desktop can do via the network\n\n84\n00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:19.995\nif we turn them on.\n\n85\n00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:21.675\nYou pick and\nchoose the settings that want.\n\n86\n00:04:21.675 --> 00:04:25.695\nNow I'll tell you, if you choose Change\nsettings, they can turn this on and\n\n87\n00:04:25.695 --> 00:04:26.255\noff too.\n\n88\n00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:28.575\nSo if you don't want them\nto be able to adjust these,\n\n89\n00:04:28.575 --> 00:04:29.885\nyou'd want to turn off Change settings.\n\n90\n00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:32.846\nAll right, so now that that's turned on,\n\n91\n00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:34.733\nsee how my Screen Sharing turned off,\nright.\n\n92\n00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:35.833\nAnd if I choose that it will tell me,\n\n93\n00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:38.016\nScreen Sharing is currently being\ncontrolled by Remote Management.\n\n94\n00:04:38.016 --> 00:04:40.626\nSo it's been taken over by that role,\nthat happens,\n\n95\n00:04:40.626 --> 00:04:43.050\nit takes over some of these pieces.\n\n96\n00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.030\nBut now I can go to a centralized\nmachine like my server.\n\n97\n00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.039\nAnd if you've bought Apple Remote More\ndesktop you can install it to App Store\n\n98\n00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.902\nand you run it and\nit looks something like this.\n\n99\n00:04:50.902 --> 00:04:55.832\nWhat is doing it is scanning my network,\nit's scanning the network looking for\n\n100\n00:04:55.832 --> 00:04:57.903\nmacs that are set up to be manage.\n\n101\n00:04:57.903 --> 00:05:01.191\nAnd so I see OS10 client 01 and\nI see Mac Mini Studio 2,\n\n102\n00:05:01.191 --> 00:05:05.100\nthat's the little chatroom machine\nwe have over here in the corner.\n\n103\n00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.010\nSo I see the machines they're up and\nthey're ready to be managed.\n\n104\n00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.740\nSo I can connect to theses and\nto start to take control of them.\n\n105\n00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.760\nNow it's this discovery them,\nI've talked about discovery protocols in\n\n106\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.540\nthe last episode and\nI mentioned Bonjour and a few other ones.\n\n107\n00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.620\nIf you look, here you'll see all\nthe ways we can discover machines.\n\n108\n00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.660\nBonjour, we can do the local\nnetwork based on TCP/IP.\n\n109\n00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.230\nWe can do a network range or network\naddresses if our management station is on\n\n110\n00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.990\ndifferent network that the clients.\n\n111\n00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.150\nYou can do all file import,\nwe can give it a CSV,\n\n112\n00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.290\na text file that has all\nthe machines listed in it.\n\n113\n00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.120\nYou can use a task server, I don't want\nto get into the nitty-gritty details, but\n\n114\n00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.370\nARD actually has two pieces, the graphical\nuser interface, and task server.\n\n115\n00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.020\nThe GUI is what we use to manage it, and\n\n116\n00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.420\nthen the Task Server's what\nactually does the work.\n\n117\n00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.860\nThe Task Server could be remote,\nand so I could specify that here.\n\n118\n00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.470\nOr a Directory Server, if I've got Open\nDirectory, or Microsoft Active Directory,\n\n119\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.960\nit can connect it and\nget the list of machines from there.\n\n120\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.150\nSo either way, it can find\nthe machines that are on the network.\n\n121\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.140\nAnd once it finds them,\nwe can manage them.\n\n122\n00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.304\nWell, sort of, it found it,\nI'm not managing it yet.\n\n123\n00:06:05.304 --> 00:06:08.410\nAnd that's because I need to\nhave permission to do it.\n\n124\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.850\nI need to have a valid administrator\naccount on that machine.\n\n125\n00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.780\nSo if I take that machine and\nI drag it and drop it up here to\n\n126\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.700\nthe All Computers folder,\nthat's me saying I want to manage it.\n\n127\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.800\nAnd when I do that, It's gonna ask me for\nan administrator password on that machine.\n\n128\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.096\nSo, I'm gonna punch in my account,\nbecause I'm an administrator.\n\n129\n00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:29.665\nA lot of people create like a help\ndesk account on all their machines so\n\n130\n00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:31.899\nthat it's there and\nit's that's what they connect with.\n\n131\n00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:37.646\nBut I'm gonna add this in,\nand did not work.\n\n132\n00:06:37.646 --> 00:06:40.020\nLet me see, my username might be wrong,\nlet's try it again.\n\n133\n00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.310\nThere we go, and\nnow it's under All Computers, and\n\n134\n00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.920\nonce it's under All Computers,\nnow I can manage it.\n\n135\n00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.670\nSee how the Mac Mini Studio\n2 doesn't show up?\n\n136\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.340\nCuz I didn't add that one, I didn't\ngive it credentials, I can't manage it.\n\n137\n00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.440\nBut once we're in here,\nnow we can manage it.\n\n138\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.990\nAnd the cool part is I can start\nto do things to this machine.\n\n139\n00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.090\nI can take it and I can observe it,\nI can click this button and\n\n140\n00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.920\nnow I'm observing the screen.\n\n141\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.940\nI didn't have to provide a username and\n\n142\n00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.580\npassword because I'm already authorized\nto manage the machine and I can see it.\n\n143\n00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.615\nAnd over here on the machine,\nthey're just working like normal.\n\n144\n00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:15.285\nThey're working like normal,\nthey see it and\n\n145\n00:07:15.285 --> 00:07:17.345\nthe other side just is\nmoderating what happens.\n\n146\n00:07:17.345 --> 00:07:19.057\nWe can switch the control mode and\n\n147\n00:07:19.057 --> 00:07:22.986\nwhen you're in a control mode now I can\nactually interact with the desktop.\n\n148\n00:07:22.986 --> 00:07:26.629\nWhen control mode is off I can't\ninteract what with it, I can see,\n\n149\n00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:28.726\nbut that's it, okay and I can point.\n\n150\n00:07:28.726 --> 00:07:32.088\nSee this circle that I'm making, so I'm\nholding my mouse down It makes a circle\n\n151\n00:07:32.088 --> 00:07:35.848\nand on the other side they see that\ncircle, they can see what I'm pointing at.\n\n152\n00:07:35.848 --> 00:07:39.588\nBut I can't actually do anything, so\nI could say 'could you please click here'\n\n153\n00:07:39.588 --> 00:07:42.901\nand I could put the circle over\nsomething and they'll see that circle.\n\n154\n00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:46.472\nSome of the other things we can\ndo in here, we can copy files,\n\n155\n00:07:46.472 --> 00:07:50.340\nyou can install applications and\nyou can execute UNIX commands.\n\n156\n00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.120\nRemember I said we might have a script\nthat we want to run remotely?\n\n157\n00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.763\nI can fire up a Unix\ncommand like uname -a,\n\n158\n00:07:55.763 --> 00:08:00.461\nand I can run that command on the system\nand I can queue that up and send it and so\n\n159\n00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:05.380\nnow it's gonna execute that on the remote\nmachine and here's the output.\n\n160\n00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.790\nI get that data back so\nI can now run scripts on it.\n\n161\n00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.450\nNow these are things that we could do\nwithout Apple remote desktop I could just\n\n162\n00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.390\nfire up an SSH client and connect.\n\n163\n00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.726\nSo, what's the value here?\n\n164\n00:08:15.726 --> 00:08:19.560\nIf I've got screen sharing\nturned on already,\n\n165\n00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.410\nif I've got the remote shelter on, why\nnot just use those, why pay the 80 bucks?\n\n166\n00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.440\nWell, where the 80 bucks comes in is that\nI can run this command not just once,\n\n167\n00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.760\nonce, but I can run it a thousand times.\n\n168\n00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.830\nI can tell to run it more than one\nmachine and it's really impressive.\n\n169\n00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.630\nWhat you do, and\nI'll just give you a quick overview,\n\n170\n00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.180\nthis isn't an Apple Remote Desktop show.\n\n171\n00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.210\nI just wanna give you an overview so\nyou understand how it works.\n\n172\n00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.010\nI've got this All Computers group here,\nright.\n\n173\n00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.880\nThat's a grouping that contains\nevery computer in my company.\n\n174\n00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.460\nBut I can create new groups,\nthey're actually called lists.\n\n175\n00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.990\nAnd so I can come up here and\nI can create a new list and\n\n176\n00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.000\nI'm gonna create one called Students.\n\n177\n00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.885\nAnd I'll create a, whoops.\n\n178\n00:08:57.885 --> 00:09:01.500\n[LAUGH] I'll create a lock message here.\n\n179\n00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.020\nI'll create another one called Teachers.\n\n180\n00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.610\nMaybe I create one called Laptops and\none called Desktops.\n\n181\n00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.080\nAnd when I add computers to be managed,\nI can drag them and\n\n182\n00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.010\ndrop them into these various lists.\n\n183\n00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.820\nSo when I take a look at OSX-CLIENT01,\n\n184\n00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.020\nmaybe that's used by students,\nand it's a desktop.\n\n185\n00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.400\nAnd see how I drag it but,\nit didn't disappear.\n\n186\n00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.010\nBut, it is under students and it's\nunder desktops, If not on your laptop,\n\n187\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.250\nit's not on you teachers.\n\n188\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.880\nSo, if I have a program that I wanna\npushed out to all of my students\n\n189\n00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.990\nI can have a thousand machines\nhere under the students list, and\n\n190\n00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.890\nI can push that program out once and\nit would appear on all 1000 machines.\n\n191\n00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.280\nOr if I wanted all of my laptops\nto get a software update,\n\n192\n00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.930\nI can push it to the laptop list and\nit would only go to them but\n\n193\n00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.800\nthere might be hundreds or thousands\nof them and it all happens at once.\n\n194\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.200\nSo, if I want to do something\ncrazy like install Cyberduck.\n\n195\n00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.040\nSo if I go back to this machine\nhere I'll bring up my spotlight and\n\n196\n00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.070\ndo a quick search for Cyberduck.\n\n197\n00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.100\nIt's not there.\n\n198\n00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.610\nJust to be doubly sure,\n\n199\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:06.110\nlet me go into my applications folder and\nlook, and Cyberduck is not present.\n\n200\n00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.380\nI don't have Cyberduck\ninstalled on this machine.\n\n201\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.469\nSo, I go here and\nI can download Cyberduck.\n\n202\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.890\nAnd as soon as I download it I can\npush it out to my client and so\n\n203\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.830\nI'll download the app.\n\n204\n00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.050\nAnd so there it goes it's downloading so\nwe'll give that a second.\n\n205\n00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.630\nAnd as soon as that's done downloading,\nI'll take that out and\n\n206\n00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.920\nI'll push it out to my clients.\n\n207\n00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.230\nSo it's almost done just got to extract.\n\n208\n00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.380\nAnd, there's good old Cyberduck.\n\n209\n00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:39.950\nNow I can go back in the remote desktop\nand I'm gonna take my students.\n\n210\n00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:46.230\nSo I decide that I want all of my\nstudents to get this application.\n\n211\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.120\nAnd so, I can take students and\nI come up here and I can use it.\n\n212\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.110\nI can use install which works really\nwell with the application as a PKG,\n\n213\n00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.150\nas a package.\n\n214\n00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.320\nBut this one doesn't,\nit's just a straight up dot app file,\n\n215\n00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.120\nso I'm gonna use copy to do it.\n\n216\n00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.450\nAnd so I'm gonna copy it and I'm gonna\ntell it the items I want to copy,\n\n217\n00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:06.260\nand I'll go and\nfind my Cyberduck file that I downloaded.\n\n218\n00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.140\nSo we'll choose that one and so\n\n219\n00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.690\nI'm gonna copy Cyberduck,\nI need to tell it where to place it.\n\n220\n00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.790\nI'm gonna place it in the applications\nfolder, cuz that's where I want it, and\n\n221\n00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.180\nif it already exists,\nI'm gonna say only replace it if the,\n\n222\n00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.020\nwe'll say, if the existing item is older.\n\n223\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.520\nIf they have an older version of Cyberduck\nwe'll replace it with this newer one.\n\n224\n00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.310\nAnd then we'll leave\nthe permissions alone.\n\n225\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.770\nWe'll let that copy over and\nwe'll leave it be.\n\n226\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:34.320\nAnd then right here what I would\nnormally see is a list of all thousand\n\n227\n00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.040\nstudent computers.\n\n228\n00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.500\nNow I only see OSX-Client01\ncuz I've only got that one.\n\n229\n00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.240\nBut you'd see all of them in that list and\nit shows whether they're available.\n\n230\n00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.660\nWhether they're on right now or\nwhether they're powered off.\n\n231\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.400\nAnd I can see them, and\nthen I can schedule it.\n\n232\n00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.430\nI could say deploy this tonight,\n\n233\n00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.530\nI don't wanna eat up the network\nbandwidth right now, do it tonight.\n\n234\n00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:51.640\nOr I can say just do it right now.\n\n235\n00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.700\nI'm gonna come over and\nhit copy and say just do it.\n\n236\n00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.820\nAnd so it's gonna create a task,\nand here's that active task for\n\n237\n00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.800\ncopying the item.\n\n238\n00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.310\nIt's reaching out to the client and\nthe client is receiving that item.\n\n239\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:08.430\nIt's copying over, and as soon as it's\ndone that client will have Cyberduck.\n\n240\n00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.660\nIt'll move down here to my history, and\nI can go to the history to see whether it\n\n241\n00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.470\nwas successful or not, and\nnow when I jump back over to my client,\n\n242\n00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.370\nit didn't have Cyberduck before,\nbut now it does right there.\n\n243\n00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.200\nAnd so the client just magically all\nof a sudden has this software, and\n\n244\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.570\nthey can come in and launch it,\nuse it, and there it is.\n\n245\n00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.450\nAnd notice because I pushed\nit with Apple Remote Desktop,\n\n246\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.960\nif I download Cyberduck from the internet\nand I run it, I get that warning that says\n\n247\n00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.500\nthis was downloaded from the internet\nare you sure you want to do it?\n\n248\n00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.340\nBut because I deployed it with\nApple Remote Desktop it knows that\n\n249\n00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.820\nI sideloaded it and\nthey didn't even get prompted.\n\n250\n00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.660\nI didn't have to provide\nany special credentials,\n\n251\n00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.740\nI was just allowed to run Cyberduck,\nit's now part of my system.\n\n252\n00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.570\nSo Apple Remote Desktop, really awesome.\n\n253\n00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.790\nRemember the value, it doesn't do anything\nthat you couldn't do on your own.\n\n254\n00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:59.160\nYou can do screen sharing you can do file\ncopies you can do Unix shell commands.\n\n255\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.400\nWhat Apple Remote Desktop does is\nlet you do it a thousand times.\n\n256\n00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.200\nDo it really easy across\na massive network.\n\n257\n00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.160\nThat's the value in that software, but\n\n258\n00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.710\nit's tied right here\ninto the sharing system.\n\n259\n00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.790\nSo that's why I wanted to spend\na minute and walk you through that.\n\n260\n00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.080\nThe other thing that I didn't get to in\nthe last episode is we talked about file\n\n261\n00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.950\nsharing and I mentioned how there\nwas more than one protocol used.\n\n262\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.300\nI mentioned there was SMB and\nthere was Apple file protocol or\n\n263\n00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.680\nAFP, and I kind of mentioned there was NFS\nin the background but you don't see it.\n\n264\n00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.800\nWell, there's actually five different\nprotocols that are running on your Mac,\n\n265\n00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.940\nyou just don't see them.\n\n266\n00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.430\nMost of the time they're\nhidden away from you and so\n\n267\n00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.990\nyou don't see that they're there.\n\n268\n00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:37.770\nBut they are there,\nthe Mac does support it.\n\n269\n00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.380\nSome of them it supports it as a host,\nsome it only supports as a client.\n\n270\n00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.730\nSo a host,\nthat's somebody that shares stuff out.\n\n271\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:48.820\nAnd if I wanna share stuff out, the\ndefault in GUI is that you have AFP and\n\n272\n00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.250\nyou have SMB.\n\n273\n00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.240\nAFP is Apple File Protocol.\n\n274\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.900\nSMB is Server Message Block.\n\n275\n00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.040\nSMB is from the Microsoft world,\nAFPs from the Apple world.\n\n276\n00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.478\nThose are the two that you can\nact as a host for by default.\n\n277\n00:13:59.478 --> 00:14:06.070\nNFS, FTP, and WebDAV,\nthose are the other three.\n\n278\n00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.090\nNFS, FTP, and\n\n279\n00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:14.310\nWebDAV, those three you can be a client\nfor, but not a server by default.\n\n280\n00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:17.070\nNFS you sort of can be a server but\nthere's no GUI tools whatsoever,\n\n281\n00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.650\nyou gotta do it all from the command line,\nso it's really hard to do it.\n\n282\n00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.830\nFTP, kind of the same thing.\n\n283\n00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.730\nYou gotta go to the command line or\nhave the server app installed to do it.\n\n284\n00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.400\nNow, those other technologies.\n\n285\n00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.320\nLet's talk about each one I guess.\n\n286\n00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.720\nAFP, Apple File Protocol.\n\n287\n00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.700\nIt's been around a long time.\n\n288\n00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.920\nApple created it awhile back but\nit's changed over the years.\n\n289\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.040\nAnd it's changed because\nthey've add new features.\n\n290\n00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.480\nThe biggest feature was Time Machine and\nAuto Save.\n\n291\n00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.640\nAuto Save, where as you edit a file it's\nautomatically saving in the background and\n\n292\n00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.360\nyou have previous versions of it.\n\n293\n00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.770\nMetadata, those are things that have been\nadded as the file systems have updated.\n\n294\n00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.770\nWell, Apple File Protocol had to\nbe updated to reflect those too.\n\n295\n00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:57.990\nSo Apple File Protocol took\na big update back in OS 10.2.\n\n296\n00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.090\nAnd that was when they rolled\nout Apple File Protocol 3.1.\n\n297\n00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.900\nAnd that gave us support for a lot of the\nstuff we use today as far as metadata and\n\n298\n00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.910\nTime Machine.\n\n299\n00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.000\nSo older versions of\nApple File Protocol can be a problem.\n\n300\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.892\nBut newer one's starting with OS 10.2 and\nnewer,\n\n301\n00:15:12.892 --> 00:15:15.864\nthey're fine you can do really you need.\n\n302\n00:15:15.864 --> 00:15:18.603\nThe current version of AFP is 3.4 and\n\n303\n00:15:18.603 --> 00:15:23.508\nnow is introduce in OS 10.8, so\nthat was introduced in Yosemite.\n\n304\n00:15:23.508 --> 00:15:29.050\n10.8 was a, shoot,\nI forgot my silly names.\n\n305\n00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:30.180\nIt was Mavericks.\n\n306\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.250\nSo in 10.8 is when that one came out.\n\n307\n00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.920\nBut Yosemite, El Capitan,\nthey've all got it,\n\n308\n00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.340\nthey have that support,\nthey're good to go.\n\n309\n00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.950\nAnd Apple file protocol works pretty well.\n\n310\n00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.250\nSMB, Server Message Block, well,\n\n311\n00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.080\nthe current version of SMB\nis actually version four.\n\n312\n00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.346\nApple devices only support\nup to SMB version three.\n\n313\n00:15:48.346 --> 00:15:51.052\nSMB version four introduced some\nnew encryption technologies that\n\n314\n00:15:51.052 --> 00:15:51.766\nare not present.\n\n315\n00:15:51.766 --> 00:15:54.291\nYou really only use it when you're\nconnecting to Windows machines.\n\n316\n00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:57.097\nIn the Window's world,\nyou can create these SMB shares,\n\n317\n00:15:57.097 --> 00:16:00.980\nthey're sometimes called CIFS shares,\na common internet file system.\n\n318\n00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.690\nAnd what it allows you to do is to be\nable to share resources on the network.\n\n319\n00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.450\nAnd it's really well supported\nup to version three.\n\n320\n00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.950\nVersion four,\nyou kind of end up in Microsoft only land.\n\n321\n00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.090\nBut it is there, we've got that support,\nwe can connect to those other systems.\n\n322\n00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.400\nBut how do you do it?\n\n323\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.443\nWell I showed you guys the Finder.\n\n324\n00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:19.001\nYou can browse in the Finder and\nyou can go and find them but\n\n325\n00:16:19.001 --> 00:16:20.340\nyou can also use your Go menu.\n\n326\n00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.040\nLet me show you what I mean,\nit's in my Go menu.\n\n327\n00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.800\nWhen I'm in the Finder,\nyou can go up here to Go and\n\n328\n00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.340\nthere's an option way down at\nthe bottom Connect to Server.\n\n329\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.910\nAnd if you choose Connect to\nServer you can actually type in\n\n330\n00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.110\na server address to connect to.\n\n331\n00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:39.280\nIf I want to connect to a server and\nmake sure that I'm using AFP,\n\n332\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.020\nI can type afp:// and\nthe name of the server.\n\n333\n00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.550\nAnd if I know the folder I want to\nconnect to, I can even type that in to.\n\n334\n00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.426\nAnd so now I'm going to connect using\nApple file protocol to OS X server 01\n\n335\n00:16:52.426 --> 00:16:55.764\nwhich actually I should probably\nadd a dot local to the end of it.\n\n336\n00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:58.060\nYou don't have to have that but\nit is a local system.\n\n337\n00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.340\nAnd then slash central share and\nI can connect to it.\n\n338\n00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.050\nI can save that to my favorites so\n\n339\n00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.860\nif I need it in the future I can\nalways connect back to it again.\n\n340\n00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:08.023\nRight, and when we connect it's\ngonna reach out to that server.\n\n341\n00:17:08.023 --> 00:17:11.500\nAnd I might have to provide a user\nname and password which I do.\n\n342\n00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.040\nSo we punch that in and if you\nchoose to save it in your key chain,\n\n343\n00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.130\nthat's kinda handy,\nyou won't type it every time.\n\n344\n00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.020\nAnd now it's gonna connect\nto that system and\n\n345\n00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.860\nI know I can connect it using\nApple file protocol, right?\n\n346\n00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.260\nSo I know I'm using AFP to get to it.\n\n347\n00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.590\nBut if I go into my system preferences,\nwhen we share that folder out, so\n\n348\n00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:34.720\nif I go into file sharing inside\nof file sharing, see what it says.\n\n349\n00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.160\nAdministrators can connect to all\nvolumes at AFP colon blah, blah, blah,\n\n350\n00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.840\nand SMB colon.\n\n351\n00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.090\nYour Mac actually does\nboth at the same time.\n\n352\n00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:46.650\nWhen you go into your options you\ncan see it right here, SMB and AFP.\n\n353\n00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:50.850\nSomebody's connected to me right now and\nit actually used SMB not AFP.\n\n354\n00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.020\nSo we can force it to disable SMB so\n\n355\n00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.360\nwe're only running AFP if that's\nwhat we want or you can run both.\n\n356\n00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.298\nAnd if you're running both you can\nguarantee you connect using that protocol\n\n357\n00:18:00.298 --> 00:18:01.560\nthrough the Go menu.\n\n358\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.660\nSo when I go back into my Go menu,\nI could have connected to that server\n\n359\n00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.145\nusing the exact same information\nexcept SMB at the beginning.\n\n360\n00:18:09.145 --> 00:18:11.505\nRight, and\nI'll add that to my favorites and so\n\n361\n00:18:11.505 --> 00:18:13.693\nnow I can connect with\nthat other protocol.\n\n362\n00:18:13.693 --> 00:18:15.938\nFor the most part it's not going\nto matter which one we connect on,\n\n363\n00:18:15.938 --> 00:18:17.410\nwe get to the files in the folders.\n\n364\n00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:18.820\nBut if it's a windows machine,\n\n365\n00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.552\nyou're going to want to connect SMB\ncause that's all it's going to support.\n\n366\n00:18:21.552 --> 00:18:22.670\nAnd then you can reach out and\n\n367\n00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.980\nyou can connect to the end user it's\nall the same once your connected.\n\n368\n00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.270\nAll right, other things that\nwe could type in that Go menu.\n\n369\n00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.650\nThe Go menu has other ones, so\n\n370\n00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.940\nif I was connected to NFS\nnetwork file system, right?\n\n371\n00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:40.990\nWhat you would type in here is nfs:// and\nthe server that you want to connect to and\n\n372\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:45.950\nso maybe you've got a server\nat 192.168.8.200 /export/,\n\n373\n00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:49.190\nI don't know, files or\nwhatever it is, right.\n\n374\n00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.429\nYou could punch that in and\n\n375\n00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:53.085\nyou can connect it with NFS\nthe support's right there.\n\n376\n00:18:53.085 --> 00:18:58.700\nSame thing for WebDAV except WebDAV's\na little different cuz it uses HTTP.\n\n377\n00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.943\nWebDAV stands for Web Distributed\nAuthoring and Versioning and\n\n378\n00:19:01.943 --> 00:19:05.075\nit basically use an HTTP protocol\nto access and edit systems.\n\n379\n00:19:05.075 --> 00:19:08.295\nIt might be using Secure,\nyou'll have to ask your administrator so\n\n380\n00:19:08.295 --> 00:19:09.602\nyou might have to do HTTPS.\n\n381\n00:19:09.602 --> 00:19:13.317\nThe only other one that's really\nimportant on here is FTP.\n\n382\n00:19:13.317 --> 00:19:15.977\nSo you can do File Transfer Protocol,\nso FTP.\n\n383\n00:19:15.977 --> 00:19:17.610\nAnd you point it at that system,\nand it'll connect.\n\n384\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.880\nIf you know an FTP server, for\n\n385\n00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.740\nexample let's say I want to\ndownload a copy of Linux.\n\n386\n00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.730\nAnd so I want to connect to ftp.usf.edu.\n\n387\n00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:31.320\nI can add that in and when I double click\non that, it's gonna try and connect.\n\n388\n00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.306\nI'll just tell it through a guest, right.\n\n389\n00:19:32.306 --> 00:19:35.066\nA lot of FTP servers allow\nanonymous connections and\n\n390\n00:19:35.066 --> 00:19:38.130\nwhen I connect now I'm\nbrowsing that FTP server.\n\n391\n00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.060\nAnd it just looks like\na folder on my hard drive.\n\n392\n00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.940\nBut I am browsing in FTP sever,\nand I can jump in here.\n\n393\n00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.186\nAnd I can start to download files or\nwhatever.\n\n394\n00:19:45.186 --> 00:19:47.190\nFTPs kind of characterize\nby how slow it is,\n\n395\n00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.690\nso see how it's taking a little while\nto load but I can browse in and\n\n396\n00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.700\nstart to navigate that system so\nyou got FTP support.\n\n397\n00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.873\nAnd then I think I already\nshowed you guys but\n\n398\n00:19:55.873 --> 00:19:58.821\njust in case I didn't under\nthe Go menu you can also use VNC.\n\n399\n00:19:58.821 --> 00:20:03.988\nSo I could type VNC colon slash slash and\nthe IP of a system and I'll be able\n\n400\n00:20:03.988 --> 00:20:09.440\nto connect for screen sharing if I want\nto use an actual VNC type connection.\n\n401\n00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.860\nMaybe I've got another, actually\nit could even be a Window machine.\n\n402\n00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.871\nThis Windows machine is running VNC.\n\n403\n00:20:15.871 --> 00:20:17.950\nLet's see what IP address it has.\n\n404\n00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.608\nIt is .146.\n\n405\n00:20:20.608 --> 00:20:25.876\nSo if I come in here and\nconnect to 192.168.0.146,\n\n406\n00:20:25.876 --> 00:20:28.666\nI can come in here and hit connect.\n\n407\n00:20:28.666 --> 00:20:31.510\nAnd then it's gonna try and connect, and\nthe system will ask for the password.\n\n408\n00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.810\nI'll punch that in,\nsave it in my Keychain and\n\n409\n00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:38.140\nonce it connects now I'm\nseeing that Windows machine.\n\n410\n00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.739\nSo here I am,\nI can fire up old Internet Explorer and\n\n411\n00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.530\nI can browse the internet\nthe exciting Microsoft way.\n\n412\n00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:47.490\nSo I've got that access, I'm just using\nVNC to connect up and manage that system.\n\n413\n00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.580\nYou can connect to Windows, Linux,\nMac, whatever it is you want.\n\n414\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.090\nI'll use Net VNC functionality.\n\n415\n00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:54.540\nSo pretty neat stuff all baked\naway in that one little menu.\n\n416\n00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.890\nWe don't normally see that stuff but\nit is all there.\n\n417\n00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.730\nAll right, a few other things that\nI wanna touch on before we move on.\n\n418\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:07.760\nIf you have El Capitan,\nEl Capitan is doing network discovery.\n\n419\n00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.030\nIt's finding machines on the network and\nit's using DNS to do that.\n\n420\n00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:15.495\nIf you're still supporting Yosemite or\nMavericks even, those two.\n\n421\n00:21:15.495 --> 00:21:19.494\nIf you still have a 10.9 on your\nnetwork or whatever then those\n\n422\n00:21:19.494 --> 00:21:23.580\nguys they actually used a slightly\ndifferent name look up system.\n\n423\n00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.930\nIt was called mDNS.\n\n424\n00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.037\nRight, it was a multicast DNS.\n\n425\n00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:29.470\nThe mDNSResponder is what\nthe little service was called and\n\n426\n00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.760\nit would locate machines on the network.\n\n427\n00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.150\nWell, it had a bug in it,\na really bad bug,\n\n428\n00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.765\nthis bug where it would cause your\nhostnames to show up as duplicated.\n\n429\n00:21:37.765 --> 00:21:40.520\nThe way mDNS would work is normally\n\n430\n00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.500\nwhen you're doing regular\ndiscovery you use Bonjour.\n\n431\n00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.590\nYou scan the whole network and\nyou'll look and see who's out there.\n\n432\n00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:49.290\nBut if you have 1,000 machines, all 1,000\nmachines are scanning the whole network.\n\n433\n00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.930\nThat's a lot of scanning.\n\n434\n00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:55.340\nSo what mDNS said was when one\nmachine scans the network,\n\n435\n00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.120\nit can cache it and\nstore what it scanned and what it found.\n\n436\n00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.260\nAnd if anybody else boots up and wants\nto scan the network, they can just ask\n\n437\n00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.110\nsomebody who's already online and\nsay hey, can you share me your cache?\n\n438\n00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:06.470\nShare your cache with me.\n\n439\n00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.910\nAnd that way they don't all have to scan.\n\n440\n00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.020\nIt was designed to optimize the network.\n\n441\n00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:14.852\nThe problem was if your laptop or\ndesktop was detected and cached and\n\n442\n00:22:14.852 --> 00:22:16.563\nthen you went offline.\n\n443\n00:22:16.563 --> 00:22:19.981\nAnd came back online it would\ndetect you as an all new system and\n\n444\n00:22:19.981 --> 00:22:22.426\nit would see you as\nhaving a duplicate name.\n\n445\n00:22:22.426 --> 00:22:25.891\nIt would say ooh there's already a down\nlaptop on the network I need to change\n\n446\n00:22:25.891 --> 00:22:28.310\nyour name and make you down laptop too.\n\n447\n00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.750\nAnd it was super annoying.\n\n448\n00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.240\nAnd they finally fixed that in El Capitan.\n\n449\n00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.130\nIn El Capitan, the way they fixed it\nis they turned off multi-cast DNS.\n\n450\n00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:36.800\nSo they got rid of it.\n\n451\n00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.830\nThey just said, you know what, forget it.\n\n452\n00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.640\nWe're not gonna fix it,\nwe're just gonna lose it.\n\n453\n00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.160\nBonjour works fine and\nthat's what's working.\n\n454\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:47.050\nSo when I launch my finder and\nI look in the shared section.\n\n455\n00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:51.070\nWhat I'm seeing here are either things\nthat I've specifically mounted, or\n\n456\n00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.740\nI'm seeing things that were\ndetected using Bonjour.\n\n457\n00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.060\nSo like Mac mini chat 3,\n\n458\n00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:59.870\nor Mac mini studio two,\nI'm seeing those by using Bonjour.\n\n459\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.350\nBut see how Mac mini chat has\nthat three in parentheses?\n\n460\n00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.420\nI didn't name it Mac mini chat three.\n\n461\n00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.171\nUnfortunately, that machine\nis still running Yosemite and\n\n462\n00:23:11.171 --> 00:23:15.813\nso it is running the multicast DNS\nresponder and it booted up at some point.\n\n463\n00:23:15.813 --> 00:23:17.556\nAnd saw that it was a duplicate, and\n\n464\n00:23:17.556 --> 00:23:20.945\nwhen it saw that it was a duplicate\nit renamed itself Mac Mini Chat 2.\n\n465\n00:23:20.945 --> 00:23:25.430\nAnd then at some point it rebooted again\nand it said there's already a chat 2 and\n\n466\n00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.339\nit renamed itself Mac Mini Chat 3.\n\n467\n00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:29.004\nWhen you see that parentheses and\n\n468\n00:23:29.004 --> 00:23:33.000\na number at the end that means that it\nwas a duplicate name on the network.\n\n469\n00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.390\nAnd prior to El Capitan,\nit happened all the time, and\n\n470\n00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:36.900\nyou were duplicating with yourself.\n\n471\n00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:37.930\nIt was silly.\n\n472\n00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.410\nAt one point my laptop\nwas Don's Macbook 14.\n\n473\n00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:44.908\nIt had done it 14 times, it's a laptop I\nkept coming in and out of the office, and\n\n474\n00:23:44.908 --> 00:23:47.208\nthe name kept changing and\nchanging, and changing.\n\n475\n00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:49.968\nSo that was a problem with\nthe old multicast DNS responder.\n\n476\n00:23:49.968 --> 00:23:51.528\nIt's gone in El Capitan.\n\n477\n00:23:51.528 --> 00:23:55.248\nIn El Capitan, we just use Bonjour and\nthat doesn't happen The problem is,\n\n478\n00:23:55.248 --> 00:23:58.272\nif you still have even one Yosemite\nsystem on your network, or\n\n479\n00:23:58.272 --> 00:24:00.890\neven one Mavericks system on your network,\nthey're\n\n480\n00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:05.280\nstill running the Multicast DNS responder,\nand these renames will still happen.\n\n481\n00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.970\nSo it's easy to spot that.\n\n482\n00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:07.980\nIt's easy to fix.\n\n483\n00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.310\nYou upgrade your systems.\n\n484\n00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.410\nUpgrade your systems to El Capitan,\nand once that's done, you can go and\n\n485\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.260\nrename your systems back,\nget rid of that parentheses number, and\n\n486\n00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.420\nthen it's back to normal.\n\n487\n00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:20.239\nSo it's just kind of a weird little\nquirk there that you may bump into in\n\n488\n00:24:20.239 --> 00:24:21.160\nthe real world.\n\n489\n00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.296\nAll right, the last thing that I need to\nmention before we wrap this section up is\n\n490\n00:24:25.296 --> 00:24:28.530\ntroubleshooting, if you can't\nconnect to another system.\n\n491\n00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.050\nI know way back in he\nbeginning of the last episode\n\n492\n00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:33.960\nI showed how if we're not actually sharing\nanything out, we're not gonna be seen on\n\n493\n00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.630\nthe network cuz we don't have\nany services to make available.\n\n494\n00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:41.820\nBut if you know you're sharing something\nout and people aren't still seeing you,\n\n495\n00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.620\nthen you probably got a network\nconnectivity issue and\n\n496\n00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.480\nyou need to test your network connection.\n\n497\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.600\nIf it's somebody on the same network\nas you, it's really easy to do that.\n\n498\n00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.640\nYou just ping their IP address.\n\n499\n00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.990\nBut if they're on a different network,\nit gets a little more difficult.\n\n500\n00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:59.730\nSo, for example I know there's\nan FTP server out there,\n\n501\n00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:03.480\nat a particular IP address, 10.1.10.4.\n\n502\n00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.390\nSo maybe I fire up my terminal,\nand I go to connect to it.\n\n503\n00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.580\nAnd so I say FTP 10.1.10.4, right.\n\n504\n00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.250\nAnd I go to connect and it fails.\n\n505\n00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.949\nI cant' get to it, but\nI know there's an FTP server there.\n\n506\n00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.100\nWhere's my problem, where's the breakdown?\n\n507\n00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.420\nOkay, where did that stop?\n\n508\n00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.910\nIt's kind of hard to say.\n\n509\n00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:27.230\nSo what you need to do is\nleverage the network utility, and\n\n510\n00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.250\nyou need to what I call\npinging from the inside out.\n\n511\n00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.990\nThere's a number of places where\nyou can have a failure and\n\n512\n00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:33.300\nwe need to figure out where.\n\n513\n00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.350\nI always start with my own machine.\n\n514\n00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:38.890\nSo looking at this machine\nit's 192.168.0.150.\n\n515\n00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.570\nYou can rung ping and\nyou can ping yourself.\n\n516\n00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.380\nNow why would you ping yourself?\n\n517\n00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.320\nWell, it's possible that you've got\na software problem on your own system.\n\n518\n00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.030\nIf the TCPIP stack is broken, for example.\n\n519\n00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.350\nAnd pinging yourself is\na great way to test that.\n\n520\n00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.818\nSo I'm gonna run a quick test,\nI'll just do four pings, and\n\n521\n00:25:56.818 --> 00:25:59.009\nI'll ping it, and I can ping myself.\n\n522\n00:25:59.009 --> 00:26:01.070\nSo TCPIP is working on my system.\n\n523\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.275\nNext I'm on the 192.68.0 network.\n\n524\n00:26:06.275 --> 00:26:09.105\nI'm trying to contact an FTP\nserver that's on the 10.1.10,\n\n525\n00:26:09.105 --> 00:26:10.800\nthat's a different network.\n\n526\n00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.350\nI'm gonna have to go through my router.\n\n527\n00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:15.050\nSo let me see if I can ping my router.\n\n528\n00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:19.430\nWell my router is 192.168.0.2,\nso I'm gonna try and\n\n529\n00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.140\nping that, and\nwhen I ping it I can pick it.\n\n530\n00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:25.180\nSo I can see my router,\nmy router is not the problem.\n\n531\n00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.170\nOr is it?\n\n532\n00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.810\nA router has two interfaces,\nan inside and an outside.\n\n533\n00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.410\nThis is the inside.\n\n534\n00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:35.030\nSo if I really want to test it I need\nto test the outside of that also, and\n\n535\n00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:41.630\nthe outside on this one is 10.1.230,\ntough, I think it's .1.\n\n536\n00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:46.740\nSo the outside on that particular\nrouter is this IP, can I ping that?\n\n537\n00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.860\nThis shows me not only can\nI get to the router, but\n\n538\n00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.960\nI'm able to be routed from the inside\ninterface to the outside interface.\n\n539\n00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.250\nI'm able to pass through the router.\n\n540\n00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:01.020\nThen can I get to the remote host?\n\n541\n00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.064\nNow the host in this case is 10.1.10.4,\nright?\n\n542\n00:27:05.064 --> 00:27:06.790\nSo can I get to that?\n\n543\n00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.427\nAnd if I fire up a ping here,\n\n544\n00:27:08.427 --> 00:27:12.940\nif this fails then it's more than\nlikely a problem on the other end.\n\n545\n00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:13.930\nIt's a problem on their end.\n\n546\n00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.820\nI can get to my router,\nI can get through my router.\n\n547\n00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.460\nBut it could be an addressing problem.\n\n548\n00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.150\nIt could be a problem out on the Internet.\n\n549\n00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:23.560\nSo there could be a problem\nin-between me and that destination.\n\n550\n00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.000\nSo the best thing to do there\nis to go to Traceroute.\n\n551\n00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.823\nAnd take a look and see what other systems\nare between you and that destination.\n\n552\n00:27:29.823 --> 00:27:33.350\nIf I punch in 10.1 10.4\nwhat's in between me and\n\n553\n00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:37.150\nthat IP and we can try and\ntrace that out and find it out.\n\n554\n00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.878\nThe only negative with Traceroute is\nthat it does get blocked sometimes,\n\n555\n00:27:39.878 --> 00:27:40.735\nlike this one is.\n\n556\n00:27:40.735 --> 00:27:43.185\nAnd that's because I've got the firewall\non my own laptop is killing it.\n\n557\n00:27:43.185 --> 00:27:45.145\nAnd you see,\nit's kind of stopping right here.\n\n558\n00:27:45.145 --> 00:27:48.355\nSo I'm not able to get past it and\nfind out those other hops.\n\n559\n00:27:48.355 --> 00:27:52.909\nSo if that is the case you could always\njust try other Internet hosts, like,\n\n560\n00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:53.989\ncan I ping Apple?\n\n561\n00:27:53.989 --> 00:27:55.095\nLet's just try and ping Apple.\n\n562\n00:27:55.095 --> 00:27:56.965\nWell, actually,\nI think Apple blocks their pings.\n\n563\n00:27:56.965 --> 00:27:58.775\nLet's take an Internet DNS server.\n\n564\n00:27:58.775 --> 00:28:00.255\nSo I'll take one of Google's DNS servers.\n\n565\n00:28:00.255 --> 00:28:01.415\nCan I ping that?\n\n566\n00:28:01.415 --> 00:28:06.110\nSo I'm gonna try to ping 8.8.8.8,\nand if I can, great.\n\n567\n00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:10.070\nIf I can't, then I've got\nInternet connectivity issues.\n\n568\n00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.590\nAnd shoot, I'm on the Traceroute tab.\n\n569\n00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.960\nLet me get to the right tool for\nthe job here and get back to Ping.\n\n570\n00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.280\nAnd I'll try that ping,\nand I can ping to Google.\n\n571\n00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.900\nSo I can get out to the Internet.\n\n572\n00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.790\nI just can't get to this FTP server.\n\n573\n00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:27.320\nBut in troubleshooting,\nI ruled out everything in between.\n\n574\n00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:32.260\nThat we need to find out what hops we\ngo through to get to that destination.\n\n575\n00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.030\nAnd let me just show you with Traceroute.\n\n576\n00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:35.580\nOops, that's not what I wanted.\n\n577\n00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.560\nLet me get back to my network\nutility here on my actual laptop.\n\n578\n00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.448\nAnd I'll traceroute to\nthe ITProTV website, right.\n\n579\n00:28:42.448 --> 00:28:45.970\nWhen I traceroute to the ITProTV website\n\n580\n00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:50.180\nI pass through a number of systems and\nwe see them all right here.\n\n581\n00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.790\nAny one of these systems could\nbe where the problem is.\n\n582\n00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.920\nIt may not be the destination, this is\nthe destination right here the ITProTV\n\n583\n00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.070\nwebsite, but\nthe problem could be anywhere in-between.\n\n584\n00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.940\nSo, Traceroute and Ping,\nthose are your friends.\n\n585\n00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.480\nAnd Traceroute's really just\npinging all these hops.\n\n586\n00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.810\nSo you could use Traceroute to\nknock this all out at once, right.\n\n587\n00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:09.470\nBut doing a ping from the inside out,\n\n588\n00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.650\nping yourself,\nping your router's inside interface,\n\n589\n00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.150\nping your router's outside interface,\nthen try and ping the destination.\n\n590\n00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:18.460\nThose four will help you\nestablish where that fault is.\n\n591\n00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.390\nAnd then Traceroute would show you where\non the Internet, if you were having some\n\n592\n00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:25.430\nkind of breakdown in here, like in Miami,\nor Washington, or wherever.\n\n593\n00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.990\nYou'd be able to spot that, and\nthen go through and fix it.\n\n594\n00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.160\nSo, that's kind of how we\ntroubleshoot these issues.\n\n595\n00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:31.940\nIf it's not one these,\n\n596\n00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.210\nif I can ping the host, then it usually\njust comes down to permissions.\n\n597\n00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.290\nGo and check your sharing settings and\nlook at the permissions.\n\n598\n00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.750\nMake sure that your user account is\nallowed to access those resources.\n\n599\n00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:43.780\nAs long as they are, you'll get in and\neverything will work fine.\n\n600\n00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.955\nSo that's basically it for\nsharing resources.\n\n601\n00:29:45.955 --> 00:29:47.520\nObviously, some of it is self-explanatory,\n\n602\n00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.640\nsome of it like file sharing\nwe've already talked about.\n\n603\n00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.390\nBut you probably saw some new stuff there.\n\n604\n00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:54.560\nThe screen sharing is kind of neat,\nApple remote desktop really cool,\n\n605\n00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.090\ndefinitely things that\ncan turn up on the exam.\n\n606\n00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:58.020\nBut things you can use in real life.\n\n607\n00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:02.130\nSo in this episode we wrapped up sharing\nresources, we talked about some of\n\n608\n00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:05.200\nthose last bells and whistles that we\ndidn't cover in the first episode.\n\n609\n00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.650\nHopefully, you guys enjoyed it but\nlooking at the clock, I'm out of time.\n\n610\n00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.400\nAnd it's a good spot to wrap this one\nup anyways, so we'll go ahead and\n\n611\n00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.040\nwrap this one up right here.\n\n612\n00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:16.745\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet and I'll see you next time.\n\n613\n00:30:16.745 --> 00:30:24.480\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:18.500\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.720\nBack again with more\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n6\n00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.930\nAnd in this episode,\nwe're gonna take a look at not so\n\n7\n00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.480\nmuch what's built into our Mac.\n\n8\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.592\nBut what we can add to it,\nthose peripheral devices.\n\n9\n00:00:30.592 --> 00:00:32.846\nThe computers, they keep getting\nsmaller and smaller each year.\n\n10\n00:00:32.846 --> 00:00:36.571\nAnd the way they get them smaller,\nin a large part, is by leaving stuff out.\n\n11\n00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:39.706\nLaptops got smaller when they\ncan leave optical drives out.\n\n12\n00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.976\nAnd then desktops got smaller when\nthey can put smaller hard drives in or\n\n13\n00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.443\nless hard drives or\neven no hard drives in some cases.\n\n14\n00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:50.007\nThese are making devices get small,\nslim, and\n\n15\n00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:53.210\na lot more generalized, right?\n\n16\n00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.038\nIt's harder to get a PC or laptop or\ndesktop that is specifically design for\n\n17\n00:00:57.038 --> 00:00:57.842\nwhat you need.\n\n18\n00:00:57.842 --> 00:01:01.393\nAnd if you want to customize it,\nto add hardware that you need,\n\n19\n00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:02.868\nit's got to be external.\n\n20\n00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:07.174\nSo peripheral devices, those are devices\nthat we hook up to the outside of our Mac,\n\n21\n00:01:07.174 --> 00:01:09.350\nthose become really important.\n\n22\n00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.529\nAnd depending on your Mac,\n\n23\n00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:13.771\nyou may have more than one different\nway that you can attach those devices.\n\n24\n00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:16.280\nIn the exam we need to know them, and\nin real life we need to know them.\n\n25\n00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.445\nSo we're gonna run through\nthose right here and\n\n26\n00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.401\nsee how we can expand that functionality.\n\n27\n00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:23.037\nNow, my laptop, for example,\nI've got a Macbook Pro.\n\n28\n00:01:23.037 --> 00:01:27.102\nAnd it's got a hard drive,\nit's got a keyboard, it has a touchpad,\n\n29\n00:01:27.102 --> 00:01:31.536\nit's got a monitor, it's got a wireless\nadapter, and that's about it.\n\n30\n00:01:31.536 --> 00:01:33.395\nWell, storage and memory, right?\n\n31\n00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:37.473\nSo I've got solid state storage inside\nof it, so it's got one hard drive.\n\n32\n00:01:37.473 --> 00:01:40.247\nBut what if I need more?\n\n33\n00:01:40.247 --> 00:01:41.433\nLet's talk about hard drive.\n\n34\n00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:45.441\nI've got a 500 gig SSD in this thing,\nwhich is a lot of storage,\n\n35\n00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:46.737\nit's enough for me.\n\n36\n00:01:46.737 --> 00:01:47.825\nBut what if I need more?\n\n37\n00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:51.800\nWhat if I bought this laptop and\nI only got the 256 gig storage option?\n\n38\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.960\nThat's not a lot of storage.\n\n39\n00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.500\nAnd now I start pressing my limit and\nso I need more storage.\n\n40\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.350\nWell you can go out and\nyou can get external storage and\n\n41\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.300\ndepending on your device, you may have\na few different ways you can connect.\n\n42\n00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.050\nRight, so for example,\none way that we might do it,\n\n43\n00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.050\nI've actually got it here on my Mac right\nnow, is that I've got a SD card installed.\n\n44\n00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.360\nSo you see how I've got Macintosh HD and\nthen I've got this SD card here.\n\n45\n00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.860\nAnd it's got the little SD card icon.\n\n46\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.740\nSo that's a digital card that's plugged\ninto the SD card slot on the side\n\n47\n00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.330\nof my laptop.\n\n48\n00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.210\nNow, SD cards have\nan interesting characteristic.\n\n49\n00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.960\nThey're really flexible,\nyou can use them in darn near everything.\n\n50\n00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.240\nA lot of cameras support them.\n\n51\n00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.880\nA lot of desktops do.\n\n52\n00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.030\nBut they're slow,\nthey are slow at communicating.\n\n53\n00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.379\nSD cards are basically hooked up\nto what's called USB 2.0 bus, and\n\n54\n00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.988\nUSB 2.0 is not terribly fast.\n\n55\n00:02:41.988 --> 00:02:45.982\nSo it's not a great technology for\nspeed, when I'm in a hurry.\n\n56\n00:02:45.982 --> 00:02:49.190\nBut it is available, I could throw that\nin and I could get some extra memory.\n\n57\n00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.810\nAnd if I look at mine,\nmine is 128 gigs, so\n\n58\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.980\nI've added 128 gigs of\nstorage to my laptop.\n\n59\n00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.960\nBut it's just slow storage.\n\n60\n00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.130\nI just have to be aware of that and\n\n61\n00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.110\nsay all right, well anything I put there\nI need to not be in a hurry about.\n\n62\n00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.990\nAnd I can get access to it.\n\n63\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.390\nSo that's a quick,\neasy way to add storage to your system.\n\n64\n00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.180\nWell, what if I want it faster?\n\n65\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.380\nYour Mac may have a couple of other\nports that are available on it.\n\n66\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.250\nThe best one is Thunderbolt.\n\n67\n00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.250\nYou may well have a Thunderbolt\nport on your system.\n\n68\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.240\nAnd you may have more than one.\n\n69\n00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.050\nSo my Macbook Pro,\nI have two Thunderbolt ports.\n\n70\n00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.340\nAnd so I can plug in Thunderbolt devices.\n\n71\n00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.880\nAnd Thunderbolt devices\nare not just hard drives.\n\n72\n00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.780\nI'm talking about hard drives, but\nyou can get all sorts of things.\n\n73\n00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.840\nThere's Thunderbolt network adapters,\nI've got one of those right here.\n\n74\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.780\nThere's Thunderbolt monitors, I mean you\ncan do display port over Thunderbolt\n\n75\n00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.660\nalso and hook even more monitors up to it.\n\n76\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.870\nThere's hard drives, there's all sorts\nof Thunderbolt peripherals out there and\n\n77\n00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.780\nmore are coming out all the time.\n\n78\n00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.040\nBut hard drives are pretty sweet\nbecause Thunderbolt is fast.\n\n79\n00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.606\nAnd so when we plug in a hard drive\ninto that Thunderbolt connector,\n\n80\n00:03:47.606 --> 00:03:49.821\nyou're really gonna get some\ngood speed and access on it.\n\n81\n00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:52.280\nAnd you can get that extra storage.\n\n82\n00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.490\nThe only problem with Thunderbolt\nis outside of the Mac world,\n\n83\n00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.120\nit's not really well-supported.\n\n84\n00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.020\nYou don't see a lot of it on the PC side,\nlike on Windows, but on Mac you do.\n\n85\n00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.440\nBut on Mac, we also have another port,\nthe USB port.\n\n86\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.280\nUSB is universal serial bus.\n\n87\n00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.260\nAnd USB, it's come a long way.\n\n88\n00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.531\nBack in the day, back in the olden days,\nwhen you bought a a Mac.\n\n89\n00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:14.718\nIf you hooked a keyboard up to it,\nor a mouse,\n\n90\n00:04:14.718 --> 00:04:17.030\nit had these proprietary\nconnectors on there.\n\n91\n00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.860\nSome of them had PS2 connectors,\nbut a lot of them were proprietary.\n\n92\n00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.700\nYou had different connectors for\ndifferent devices.\n\n93\n00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.480\nDedicated printer ports, you had SCSI\nports for external storage and scanners,\n\n94\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.290\nyou had these dedicated ports.\n\n95\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.200\nWhat Universal Serial Bus did was it\ntried to unify all of that into one port.\n\n96\n00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.000\nAnd so the USB 1.0 specification came out,\nand it was designed where it could handle\n\n97\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.940\nkeyboards, mice, printers,\nhard drives, all sorts of stuff.\n\n98\n00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.690\nOn this one standard port,\nbut it was slow.\n\n99\n00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.076\nAnd so over time, USB 2.0 came out.\n\n100\n00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:53.465\nAnd Apple didn't really get on the USB 2.0\nbandwagon because they started supporting\n\n101\n00:04:53.465 --> 00:04:54.740\nFireWire.\n\n102\n00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.020\nFireWire was faster at the time.\n\n103\n00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.946\nWhen USB 2.0 was running at like,\n200 megabit speeds,\n\n104\n00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:01.530\nFireWire was running at 400.\n\n105\n00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.580\nIt was significantly faster.\n\n106\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.810\nSo if you were hooking\nup a digital camera for\n\n107\n00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.020\ndoing videography work,\nyou wanted FireWire.\n\n108\n00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.330\nAnd back then, who used Apples?\n\n109\n00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.976\nCreative people, graphic designers,\nvideographers, people like that.\n\n110\n00:05:13.976 --> 00:05:15.230\nThey used Apple products.\n\n111\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.882\nIt's not like today,\ntoday all sorts of people use Macs.\n\n112\n00:05:17.882 --> 00:05:21.996\nBut ten years ago it was really just\nthe creatives, the marketing people,\n\n113\n00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:27.060\nphotographers, those people, they really\nkind of centered around the Mac world.\n\n114\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.610\nAnd so technologies that required\nfast storage were pretty prevalent,\n\n115\n00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.620\nso that's where FireWire came in.\n\n116\n00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.260\nWell, USB's continued to evolve,\nand now we have USB 3.0, and\n\n117\n00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.540\nthat's the newer, faster one.\n\n118\n00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.060\nFireWire hasn't really kept\nup with USB the same way.\n\n119\n00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.220\nAnd so Apple chose to move away from\nFireWire and moved to Thunderbolt.\n\n120\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.718\nWell in your newer devices, like in my\nMacbook here, I have Thunderbolt and\n\n121\n00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:52.528\nUSB 3.0.\n\n122\n00:05:52.528 --> 00:05:56.100\nThey're both fast, they're both reliable.\n\n123\n00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.900\nI get a little bit better performance\nout of a Thunderbolt connector than I do\n\n124\n00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.080\nUSB 3.0.\n\n125\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.070\nBut they're pretty close and so I get\npretty good performance out of those,\n\n126\n00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.120\nit's nice to have them.\n\n127\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.660\nIf you have a Macbook Air,\nthe newest Macbook Air's,\n\n128\n00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.690\nthey don't have Thunderbolt.\n\n129\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.216\nIn fact, they just have one USB\n3.0 connector and that's it.\n\n130\n00:06:12.216 --> 00:06:14.280\nThat's all they have in\nthe new Macbook Air's, so\n\n131\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.130\nApple's acknowledged that that's\nthe kind of the way to go.\n\n132\n00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.383\nIf you get your new iMacs,\nmy iMac at home is not new.\n\n133\n00:06:20.383 --> 00:06:24.626\nBut if you get one of the newer ones,\nit will have two Thunderbolt ports and\n\n134\n00:06:24.626 --> 00:06:26.830\nfour USB 3.0 ports, you get both.\n\n135\n00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.550\nSo we're starting to see both of\nthose ports available on each system.\n\n136\n00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.690\nSo when I go to buy a peripheral,\nlike an external hard drive, I can pick.\n\n137\n00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.679\nI can get a Thunderbolt hard drive\nthat I know will work on my Mac.\n\n138\n00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:41.839\nOr I can get USB 3.0 hard drive and\nit will work on Macs, Windows, Linux,\n\n139\n00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.840\nwhatever because everybody supports USB.\n\n140\n00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.260\nSo it's up to you which\none you wanna go with.\n\n141\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.470\nOne quick word of caution, in real life\nland it can be little hard to recognize\n\n142\n00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.860\nwhether you have a USB 3.0 or not.\n\n143\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.291\nSo I wanna show you guys,\nwe'll fire up our little Skycam.\n\n144\n00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:59.989\nI wanna show you how with USB 2.0,\nwe had connectors that weren't\n\n145\n00:06:59.989 --> 00:07:05.310\nreally standardized, so vendors could\nkind of do whatever they wanted.\n\n146\n00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.060\nSome of them had little white connectors.\n\n147\n00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.280\nSo this is a USB connector right here,\nand it's kind of a standard shape and\n\n148\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.078\nsize, and see how it's got a little\nwhite piece of plastic inside of it?\n\n149\n00:07:17.078 --> 00:07:20.760\nWith USB 2.0 it would normally\nbe either black or white.\n\n150\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.405\nSometimes you could see other colors,\nbut it was typically black or white.\n\n151\n00:07:23.405 --> 00:07:27.492\nWith USB 3.0, it was significantly faster.\n\n152\n00:07:27.492 --> 00:07:30.733\nAnd so they wanted to create some way\nto visually designate that you were on\n\n153\n00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:32.240\nthe faster connector.\n\n154\n00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.410\nSo USB 3.0 devices almost always\nhave blue inside of them.\n\n155\n00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.300\nThat blue connector, that's the clue\nthat this is a USB 3.0 connector.\n\n156\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.820\nWith USB 2.0, it's harder to tell, what\nyou would see is usually that coloring.\n\n157\n00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.630\nBut USB 1.0 and USB 2.0 looked identical.\n\n158\n00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:55.290\nSo most USB 2.0 devices would actually\nhave SS written on them for super speed.\n\n159\n00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.518\nSo when USB 2.0 came out, they thought\nit was super speed, now it's garbage.\n\n160\n00:07:59.518 --> 00:08:01.198\nSo you see super speed and\nyou just kind of laugh about it.\n\n161\n00:08:01.198 --> 00:08:02.858\nBut they would have that notation.\n\n162\n00:08:02.858 --> 00:08:05.366\nOf course, the device that\nI've got here in front of me,\n\n163\n00:08:05.366 --> 00:08:07.320\ndoesn't have that notation at all.\n\n164\n00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.500\nBut we can look at it, it's not blue,\nso that's a pretty good hint.\n\n165\n00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.340\nOn this USB 3 device, though,\n\n166\n00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.590\nI guess it'd be probably next to\nimpossible to see on the camera.\n\n167\n00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.910\nBut they've actually\nwritten USB 3.0 on it,\n\n168\n00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.970\nso that's kind of a nice little hint but\nthat blue coloring is a dead giveaway.\n\n169\n00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.304\nThe reason I bring that up,\n\n170\n00:08:23.304 --> 00:08:26.089\nis when you look at your Mac,\nif you've got an older Mac,\n\n171\n00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:30.402\nit might only have USB 2.0 ports on it and\nthey'll have black plastic inside of them.\n\n172\n00:08:30.402 --> 00:08:34.170\nBut if you have a newer Mac,\none that has USB 3.0 ports on it,\n\n173\n00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:37.100\nthen you'll actually\nsee where they're blue.\n\n174\n00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:43.114\nLet me, here, I'll take my laptop and\nI'm gonna drive our crew kind of crazy and\n\n175\n00:08:43.114 --> 00:08:48.155\nshow you, how it's really difficult\nbecause on the Macbook Pros,\n\n176\n00:08:48.155 --> 00:08:50.200\nlike this one, let me see.\n\n177\n00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.593\nCan we go to the skycam on that?\n\n178\n00:08:51.593 --> 00:08:56.328\nI'm not sure how well this is gonna show\nup but when we look at the port on my Mac.\n\n179\n00:08:56.328 --> 00:08:59.220\nI'm gonna try really hard not\nto drop this off the table,\n\n180\n00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.857\nsee how it's not blue, right?\n\n181\n00:09:00.857 --> 00:09:04.391\nOn the iMacs they actually made it blue\non this side too, so you could look and\n\n182\n00:09:04.391 --> 00:09:07.111\nyou could see that blue port and\nyou know it was USB 3.0.\n\n183\n00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:10.389\nBut on the MacBook Pros, they left it\nwhite cause it looks prettier, right?\n\n184\n00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:14.610\nIt's about appearance and\nmarketing, so it left it white.\n\n185\n00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.900\nSo unless you read the technical\nspecifications you don't necessarily know\n\n186\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.030\nthat it's USB 3.0, right?\n\n187\n00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.663\nAnd it is in the specs but you wanna make\nsure if you're doing external storage you\n\n188\n00:09:22.663 --> 00:09:24.331\nhave the fastest storage possible.\n\n189\n00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:28.061\nYou can see I've got the two\nThunderbolt ports here and USB 3.0.\n\n190\n00:09:28.061 --> 00:09:34.681\nAnd if I flip to the other side, you'll\nsee where I've got another USB 3.0 port,\n\n191\n00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:40.800\nan HDMI port, so I hook a television or\na monitor up via HDMI if I wanted.\n\n192\n00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.400\nAnd I've got my SD card slot and my little\nSD card fits flush with the laptop,\n\n193\n00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.430\nI always leave it in there.\n\n194\n00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.320\nSo it's in there filling up that gap, so\n\n195\n00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.900\nthese are all spots where\nI can attach peripherals.\n\n196\n00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.750\nHDMI, that would be for displays.\n\n197\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.400\nIf I'm travelling to do a presentation,\n\n198\n00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.460\nI might hook up with a projector there,\nright?\n\n199\n00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.980\nNow, Thunderbolt ports serve two purposes.\n\n200\n00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.830\nSo Thunderbolt is the same\nconnector as display port, so\n\n201\n00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.670\nI can hook up monitors with display ports,\ntoo.\n\n202\n00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.510\nThe nice part here is,\nI can throw adapters on it.\n\n203\n00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:11.230\nI can throw a VGA adapter or\na DVI adapter an HDMI adapter and\n\n204\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.130\nI could have more than one HDMI connector.\n\n205\n00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:18.780\nSo you can hook monitors up to it but you\ncan also hook up Thunderbolt peripherals.\n\n206\n00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.840\nThe nice little thing about Thunderbolt\nperipherals, is you can daisy chain them.\n\n207\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.550\nIf I have three hard drives,\nthe hard drives might have two\n\n208\n00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.790\nThunderbolt ports on them, and\nI can daisy chain, I can run into one.\n\n209\n00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.920\nRun out of hard drive one into hard drive\ntwo, run out of hard drive two into hard\n\n210\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.590\ndrive three, and\nhave them all plugged into one port.\n\n211\n00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.620\nOr I could have more than one monitor,\nI could have three monitors, and\n\n212\n00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.965\ndaisy chain them all off\nof one Thunderbolt port.\n\n213\n00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.990\nSo that's kind of the neat functionality\nthat you get this added functionality with\n\n214\n00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.680\nthese expansion ports, and\n\n215\n00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.000\non a laptop you usually have\na good range of ports like that.\n\n216\n00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.170\nOn a desktop you do too but\non the really thin ones, the Macbook Airs.\n\n217\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.300\nThey make them so small, they just\ncan't fit that many ports on them.\n\n218\n00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.320\nAnd so the newest Macbook Airs have just\na single USB C connector that's that\n\n219\n00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.550\nreally tiny one,\nalmost looks like a lightning connector.\n\n220\n00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.870\nAnd it is USB 3.0 but\nit can charge the laptop also, and\n\n221\n00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.910\nit can do all of that from\nright inside of that device.\n\n222\n00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:17.000\nNow, as far as peripherals, when you\nneed to add something to your device,\n\n223\n00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.850\nto your system, you can pretty\nmuch go out there and buy it.\n\n224\n00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.470\nTons of people make peripherals,\nit just depends on what you want.\n\n225\n00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.110\nI've got kind of arranged here on the desk\naround me several different things\n\n226\n00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.720\nthat I use.\n\n227\n00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.330\nThese are peripherals that I\nactually make use of every day.\n\n228\n00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.390\nFor example, Touchpad's are nice but\nI like a trackball and so\n\n229\n00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:36.100\nI've got a wireless trackball that I use\nand it's just got a little USB dongle\n\n230\n00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.310\nthat I plug into the USB port and\nthat makes it connected.\n\n231\n00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.530\nI don't need drivers or anything,\nI can just plug it right in,\n\n232\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.630\nmy Mac will recognize it, and\nnow I've got a trackball.\n\n233\n00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.781\nIt's really nice to have, okay?\n\n234\n00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:52.848\nNot every device is that easy,\nApple builds a lot of drivers in.\n\n235\n00:11:52.848 --> 00:11:56.630\nIf you're plugging in a trackball,\nif you're plugging in a hard drive.\n\n236\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.640\nThis is a USB 3.0 hard drive,\nit's got a little blue connector on it.\n\n237\n00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.010\nI can plug it right into my laptop,\nand I'll have it.\n\n238\n00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.270\nThis is actually my Time Machine drive,\nI backup my laptop to it.\n\n239\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:09.260\nSo, I can plug this in,\nI don't need drivers, it just works.\n\n240\n00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.180\nBut if you plug in a printer,\nif you plug in something like this.\n\n241\n00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.740\nThis is a USB network adapter,\nApple doesn't sell a USB network adapter.\n\n242\n00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.710\nWhat they sell is the Thunderbolt to\nethernet adapter which I've already got\n\n243\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.800\nhere and if you plug that it just works\nright out of the box and that's it.\n\n244\n00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.270\nBut this is from a third party,\n\n245\n00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.560\nthis is from who is this from Anchor,\nanother company, right?\n\n246\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.610\nI may not have a driver for this,\nI might plug it in, and it doesn't work.\n\n247\n00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.310\nAnd so, what do I do then?\n\n248\n00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.400\nWhen we add peripherals, a lot of times\nwe've gotta add support for them and\n\n249\n00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.860\nthere's a few different\nways that can happen, okay.\n\n250\n00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.180\nSometimes, a peripheral is designed\nto work with a specific application.\n\n251\n00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.620\nAnd so the application will\nhave the drivers built into it.\n\n252\n00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.500\nA great example of that is iTunes.\n\n253\n00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.790\nIf I hook an iPad or\n\n254\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:00.830\nan iPhone up to my laptop,\ndoes it have a driver for that software?\n\n255\n00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:04.040\nWell, on an Apple it does,\nif it's a Windows machine it doesn't, but\n\n256\n00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.840\nif I install iTunes, iTunes brings the\ndrivers for that hardware along with it.\n\n257\n00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.050\nSo that when you plug in an iPad or\niPhone, iTunes will recognize it and\n\n258\n00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.340\nallow you to synchronize music and\nset your library and all that.\n\n259\n00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:20.142\nThe driver for the hardware is\nincluded with the software.\n\n260\n00:13:20.142 --> 00:13:20.880\nThat happens,\n\n261\n00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.690\nespecially with really proprietary\nhardware like medical monitoring devices,\n\n262\n00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:31.210\nCAD or like CNC machines,\nthe big computer design machines.\n\n263\n00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.690\nThose things there are often turns had\ndrivers that are built into the software\n\n264\n00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.840\nbut other times we've gotta go out and\nget it ourselves.\n\n265\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.810\nSo let's talk about that.\n\n266\n00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.890\nLet's take this adapter\nhere as an example.\n\n267\n00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.540\nSo I'm pretty sure,\nI don't have a driver for this built in.\n\n268\n00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.251\nSo if I plug it in,\nI doubt it's gonna work.\n\n269\n00:13:46.251 --> 00:13:49.039\nSo before I plug it in,\nI'm gonna go to the vendor's website and\n\n270\n00:13:49.039 --> 00:13:51.045\nsee if I can find a driver package for it.\n\n271\n00:13:51.045 --> 00:13:54.025\nSo let's find out,\nwe'll find out together.\n\n272\n00:13:54.025 --> 00:13:56.525\nI've never used this adapter, so\nI'm kinda curious to see myself.\n\n273\n00:13:56.525 --> 00:13:59.075\nSo first off, the company is called Anker.\n\n274\n00:13:59.075 --> 00:14:02.865\nI don't really know their website, so I'll\ndo a quick Google search here and try and\n\n275\n00:14:02.865 --> 00:14:05.560\nfind them, Anker.com, all right.\n\n276\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.090\nAnd today we'll speak English and\nI can get a discount.\n\n277\n00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.140\nI'll pass on that.\n\n278\n00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.890\nAll right, so I wanna install a driver.\n\n279\n00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.040\nMost websites will have a support\npage that you can go to and\n\n280\n00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.970\nyou can jump to that support page.\n\n281\n00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.500\nFind your product, and\ndownload the driver.\n\n282\n00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.910\nAnd so when I to go to their support page,\n\n283\n00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.810\nright here we've got downloads and\ndrivers.\n\n284\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.396\nAnd they are asking me to pick\nwhat device I've got and boy,\n\n285\n00:14:25.396 --> 00:14:27.120\nlooks like they've got a lot of stuff.\n\n286\n00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.830\nWe've got Bluetooth speakers,\nbattery packs,\n\n287\n00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:35.875\nUSB chargers we are getting closer\nwhere is my USB network adapter?\n\n288\n00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:39.486\nI don't wanna spend all day searching for\nthis, so somewhere in here, we will find\n\n289\n00:14:39.486 --> 00:14:43.010\nthat network adapter and there is probably\nsome faster way for me to search this.\n\n290\n00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.396\nLet's see,\nif there is search box at the top?\n\n291\n00:14:44.396 --> 00:14:46.895\nThere is, all right, so\nwe've got a product name here.\n\n292\n00:14:46.895 --> 00:14:49.965\nSo I'm gonna type in this name,\n\n293\n00:14:49.965 --> 00:14:57.036\nthis is a USB3.0 GIGABIT ETHERNET ADAPTER,\nis the name of this thing.\n\n294\n00:14:57.036 --> 00:14:58.035\nActually, it has a model number,\n\n295\n00:14:58.035 --> 00:14:59.384\nI probably should have\ntyped that in instead.\n\n296\n00:14:59.384 --> 00:15:00.695\nLet's try that.\n\n297\n00:15:00.695 --> 00:15:08.032\nSo this one is Y-3461 and we get nothing.\n\n298\n00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:09.140\nAll right, let's go a little more generic,\n\n299\n00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.660\nthis is apparently not the best\npage to go and find stuff.\n\n300\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.568\nThere we go, all right.\n\n301\n00:15:12.568 --> 00:15:15.343\nSo we've got a couple adapters here we go,\n\n302\n00:15:15.343 --> 00:15:20.431\nUSB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter and\nif you look they've got drivers for\n\n303\n00:15:20.431 --> 00:15:25.379\nWindows, Windows 8, Windows 7,\nVista, XP, Mac OS 10.5 or above.\n\n304\n00:15:25.379 --> 00:15:27.633\nAll right, so they've got Mac drivers,\nthat's a good sign.\n\n305\n00:15:27.633 --> 00:15:30.130\nIf they didn't have Mac\ndrivers what could I do?\n\n306\n00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.900\nNothing [LAUGH] I can't use the adapter.\n\n307\n00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.390\nThey don't have a driver for it.\n\n308\n00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.940\nI plug it in, the adapter's dead\nin the water, and that's it.\n\n309\n00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.060\nThere are some devices that\njust will not work on a Mac,\n\n310\n00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.110\njust like there's some devices\nthat won't work on Windows.\n\n311\n00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.363\nIt's up to the vendor\nto write that driver.\n\n312\n00:15:43.363 --> 00:15:47.641\nSo, when I look, I can see right here that\nwe've got a few different options, and\n\n313\n00:15:47.641 --> 00:15:50.195\nI want this upgrade patch for\nMac OS 10.10.\n\n314\n00:15:50.195 --> 00:15:52.752\nNow, here's a little problem, all right.\n\n315\n00:15:52.752 --> 00:15:54.898\nAm I running 10.10?\n\n316\n00:15:54.898 --> 00:15:58.864\nWell, this is an El Capitan show,\nso I'm running 10.11.\n\n317\n00:15:58.864 --> 00:16:02.724\nThat means they have not updated\nthe driver for El Capitan yet\n\n318\n00:16:02.724 --> 00:16:03.940\nIs that a problem?\n\n319\n00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.248\nIt can be.\n\n320\n00:16:06.248 --> 00:16:10.590\nSometimes hardware won't work right\nuntil the right driver is written.\n\n321\n00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:13.090\nEl Capitan changed some security\npositions on the back ends,\n\n322\n00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.350\nespecially with how software\nwas allowed to access hardware.\n\n323\n00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.060\nSo I have, at home,\nI have a video capture card.\n\n324\n00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.120\nIt's an external video capture card.\n\n325\n00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.040\nAnd when I upgraded El Capitan,\nit started running extremely slow.\n\n326\n00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.880\nAnd it wasn't until the vendor put\nout an update that it started running\n\n327\n00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.890\nnormal again.\n\n328\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.660\nSo sometimes updates can break things.\n\n329\n00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.820\nSo we need to test this driver to make\nsure it's safe before we deploy it\n\n330\n00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.610\nwidespread throughout our company.\n\n331\n00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.590\nBut the odds are it's gonna be fine.\n\n332\n00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.675\nWhere we really run into risk is\nwhen you get drivers built for\n\n333\n00:16:42.675 --> 00:16:45.185\n10.6.8 or earlier, right?\n\n334\n00:16:45.185 --> 00:16:48.140\n10.6.8 is where Apple finally\nmade that code over and\n\n335\n00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.680\nsaid we're not gonna\nsupport 32-bit anymore.\n\n336\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.990\nWe're gonna go all 64-bit.\n\n337\n00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.350\nWell El Capitan is\na 64-bit operating system.\n\n338\n00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.150\nWe've gotta have a 64-bit driver or\nit's not gonna work.\n\n339\n00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:03.070\nIf you get a driver that was made for OS\n10.10.5, it might be a 32 bit driver and\n\n340\n00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.320\nthat's a problem.\n\n341\n00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.360\nSo we got to make sure that any\ndriver we install is 64 bit.\n\n342\n00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.205\nThis is for 10.10 so I know I'm safe.\n\n343\n00:17:10.205 --> 00:17:10.890\nRight?\n\n344\n00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.505\nBut if it didn't say that,\nthen I might be in trouble.\n\n345\n00:17:13.505 --> 00:17:14.040\nAl right.\n\n346\n00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.810\nSo I'm gonna click on that link and\ndownload that driver.\n\n347\n00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.670\nAnd so it's going to throw it\ndown into my downloads and\n\n348\n00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.780\nit is going to pull and\nthrow it somewhere.\n\n349\n00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.850\nHere, that must be this.\n\n350\n00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:26.830\nRTUNIC.\n\n351\n00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.270\nThere we go.\n\n352\n00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:32.180\nAll right, so here's the driver\nthat I just downloaded, okay?\n\n353\n00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.550\nNow, notice it's a PKG file.\n\n354\n00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:35.150\nThis is an app.\n\n355\n00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.760\nThe reason is drivers,\nthey have to insert themselves\n\n356\n00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.800\ninto the base operating system so\nwe can see the hardware.\n\n357\n00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.410\nWhat these typically are are what\nare called kernel extensions.\n\n358\n00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:47.860\nUnder the hood, we have Unix running.\n\n359\n00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.030\nWe have BSD.\n\n360\n00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.710\nAnd it's got the Darwin kernel.\n\n361\n00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.405\nAnd the Darwin kernel relies on\nthese kernel extensions, or KEXT.\n\n362\n00:17:54.405 --> 00:17:55.150\nK-E-X-T.\n\n363\n00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.760\nKernel extensions,\nto be able to support various hardware.\n\n364\n00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.400\nYou've got kernel extensions\ninstalled in your system already.\n\n365\n00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.450\nYou just don't normally see them.\n\n366\n00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.910\nI think I might have shown\nit in another episode,\n\n367\n00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.490\nbut just, in case you wanna see them.\n\n368\n00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.870\nIf you ever browse to\n/Library/Extensions/, you can look and\n\n369\n00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.810\nyou'll see some in here.\n\n370\n00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.130\nAnd I've installed some\nextensions on mine.\n\n371\n00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.260\nSo you'll see like these Blackmagic.kext.\n\n372\n00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.600\nWe have these Blackmagic converters.\n\n373\n00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.470\nOr SANLink, here.\n\n374\n00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.800\nI have a 10-gigabit ethernet adapter.\n\n375\n00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.710\nNo Mac has a ten gigabit\nethernet adapter in it so.\n\n376\n00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.590\nThere's a company that\nmakes a Thunderbolt one.\n\n377\n00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.820\nAnd you can plug it in via Thunderbolt and\nyou'll have a ten gig Ethernet Adapter.\n\n378\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.283\nWell, you need a driver for it.\n\n379\n00:18:34.283 --> 00:18:35.468\nThat's my driver right there.\n\n380\n00:18:35.468 --> 00:18:38.630\nThe SANLink2-10GE.kext.\n\n381\n00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.700\nI installed that so\nthat it would support it.\n\n382\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.540\nI didn't put that there myself.\n\n383\n00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.550\nI ran a PKG file, right?\n\n384\n00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.763\nSo when we go to install\nthis network adapter,\n\n385\n00:18:46.763 --> 00:18:48.821\nit's likely going to add something here.\n\n386\n00:18:48.821 --> 00:18:50.144\nThere's one other place.\n\n387\n00:18:50.144 --> 00:18:56.216\nThere's /System/Library/Extensions, right?\n\n388\n00:18:56.216 --> 00:18:59.520\nThose are the one's that Apple bakes\ninto the operating system for you.\n\n389\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.460\nThis come with El Capitan.\n\n390\n00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.010\nSo, we don't normally add anything here.\n\n391\n00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:06.970\nThis should all be one's that came with\nthe system and that were built into it.\n\n392\n00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.580\nAs you look at that list,\nthere's a lot of hardware.\n\n393\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.920\nI'm gonna start where you might not have.\n\n394\n00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.340\nFor example, in my laptop,\nif I go into About This Mac, and I look,\n\n395\n00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:20.680\nit'll tell me in here that I have an Intel\nIris, one and a half gig video card.\n\n396\n00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.630\nMy video card is an Intel Iris card,\nright?\n\n397\n00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.680\nBut if I look here in\nthe kernel extensions,\n\n398\n00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.050\nthere's all these GeForce\nkernel extensions.\n\n399\n00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.730\nThose are for the NVIDIA GeForce cards.\n\n400\n00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.560\nMy iMac at home, I have an NVIDIA GeForce\nvideo card in that one, right?\n\n401\n00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.500\nIf you wanna do 3D, or\nplay video games, or whatever.\n\n402\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.670\nYou need to have that NVIDIA card.\n\n403\n00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.420\nI don't have that in my laptop.\n\n404\n00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.670\nWell, Apple packages the kernel\nextensions with the operating system so\n\n405\n00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.900\nthat they're there if you need them.\n\n406\n00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.420\nIf you don't need them, they don't run.\n\n407\n00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.900\nThey don't take up extra memory or\nanything.\n\n408\n00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:51.710\nThey just sit there.\n\n409\n00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:52.990\nThey're very small on the hard drive, so\n\n410\n00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.850\nit's not even taking up\na lot of hard drive space.\n\n411\n00:19:54.850 --> 00:20:00.570\nSo you'll see a lot of kernel extensions\nin here that you may not even be using.\n\n412\n00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.070\nIt's for\nhardware that you don't necessarily have.\n\n413\n00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.050\nBut it's there so\nthat you don't necessarily need it later.\n\n414\n00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.680\nWhen I plug in this USB 3.0 hard drive,\n\n415\n00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.120\nit doesn't matter that my Mac didn't\ncome with a USB 3.0 hard drive.\n\n416\n00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.703\nThe kernel extension's already there.\n\n417\n00:20:13.703 --> 00:20:15.150\nRight?\nThose are baked into the system.\n\n418\n00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.950\nBut the ones that we see\nin /Library/Extensions,\n\n419\n00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:23.260\nthose are the ones that we add, right?\n\n420\n00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.680\nAnd some of these do actually come with\nthe OS but a lot of these are ones we add.\n\n421\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.940\nSo I've got ones that you probably don't\nhave on yours like the Blackmagic ones,\n\n422\n00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.290\nlike that SANLink adapter,\n\n423\n00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.720\nthose are the ones that I've installed\nthat you may not have, all right?\n\n424\n00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.900\nSo, when I go to install this package,\nwhen I run that,\n\n425\n00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.140\nit's gonna run and\nhere it's setting up a Realtek USB NIC.\n\n426\n00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.780\nAnd I can hit Continue on that.\n\n427\n00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:45.750\nIt's gonna install it.\n\n428\n00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.770\nIt's gonna install the driver.\n\n429\n00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:47.600\nIt's just kind of warning me.\n\n430\n00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.941\nIt's telling me this driver is for\nMac OS 10.6 or\n\n431\n00:20:50.941 --> 00:20:54.320\nnewer, which is their way of saying,\nhey this is a 64-bit extension.\n\n432\n00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.520\nSo it doesn't work on the earlier\nones that are 32 bit.\n\n433\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.090\nAnd I'll go ahead and hit Continue.\n\n434\n00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.410\nAnd I guess I'll speak English today.\n\n435\n00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.220\nI'll agree to their license,\nand we'll let it go.\n\n436\n00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.555\nNotice the kernel extension 319 K in\nsize very small, they're not big.\n\n437\n00:21:07.555 --> 00:21:10.100\nIt's just telling the operating\nsystem how to talk to the hardware.\n\n438\n00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.500\nBut it is important\nbecause if I don't have it\n\n439\n00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.810\nI can't talk to the hardware, can I.\n\n440\n00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:15.990\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n441\n00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.640\nSo we're going inside.\n\n442\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.510\nNow it's warning me that once\nit installs it's gonna reboot\n\n443\n00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.940\nmy system which is annoying but\nI'm gonna let happen and\n\n444\n00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:27.030\nthe reason is the kernel only\nloads extension at boot time.\n\n445\n00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:31.260\nSo when I start to add extensions,\nif they weren't there when I booted up,\n\n446\n00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.340\nthen they're not gonna be recognized.\n\n447\n00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.280\nSo they need to be there.\n\n448\n00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.230\nIt kind of indexes them all at boot time.\n\n449\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.780\nSo once they're installed,\nit's gonna reboot, and\n\n450\n00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.830\nthen I'll now have that new kernel\nextension support in there.\n\n451\n00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.950\nAnd now, my USB adapter should\nwork when I plug it in.\n\n452\n00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:44.540\nOkay.\n\n453\n00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.860\nNow, I showed you via the command line,\n\n454\n00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.590\nthere's other ways that we could go in and\nview it.\n\n455\n00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.130\nFor example,\n\n456\n00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.430\nif you wanna see the kernel extensions,\nyou can just go into your System Report.\n\n457\n00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.290\nIf I go into my About This Mac screen and\ngo into System Report,\n\n458\n00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.110\nwhich is the same as going to\nthe system information utility.\n\n459\n00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.735\nIn here I can see my\nhardware that's connected.\n\n460\n00:22:00.735 --> 00:22:03.750\nRight.\nThis is actual hardware that's present\n\n461\n00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:04.910\non the system.\n\n462\n00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:09.340\nBut if I scroll down to Software,\nunder Software I can go to Extensions.\n\n463\n00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.259\nAnd under Extensions it will show me all\nthe extensions that I've loaded whether\n\n464\n00:22:13.259 --> 00:22:14.881\nthe hardware's present or not.\n\n465\n00:22:14.881 --> 00:22:18.876\nAnd see mine looks empty is not actually\nempty it's just taking a minute to load.\n\n466\n00:22:18.876 --> 00:22:22.424\nI've got my little spinning pin will\ndown there cause it's looking all that\n\n467\n00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:25.696\nextensions in the library folder\nas well as the /System/Library and\n\n468\n00:22:25.696 --> 00:22:27.680\ntrying to build that list for me.\n\n469\n00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.990\nAnd when it builds the list,\nit shows me the extension,\n\n470\n00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.840\nthe version number,\nwhen it was modified, and so on.\n\n471\n00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.600\nSo I can probably sort them by\nmodification to figure out which ones I've\n\n472\n00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.460\ninstalled.\n\n473\n00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:41.850\nSome of these are Apple ones,\nbut if I start to look and see.\n\n474\n00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.010\nWell here.\n\n475\n00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:46.490\nI installed a program called\nParagon NTFS for Mac.\n\n476\n00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.970\nAnd what it lets me do is read and write\nto NTFS partitions from inside of a Mac.\n\n477\n00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.581\nNormally, Mac OS can only\nread NTFS drives, but\n\n478\n00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:55.881\nthis kernel extension lets me write also.\n\n479\n00:22:55.881 --> 00:22:57.537\nAnd so I've got it installed, and\n\n480\n00:22:57.537 --> 00:23:00.862\nit's telling me that it was last\nmodified January 4th, 2016.\n\n481\n00:23:00.862 --> 00:23:04.310\nI'm currently running version 14.1.187,\nright?\n\n482\n00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.210\nSo if there's an update,\nI can go and identify the update.\n\n483\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:12.310\nAnd over here, it's not from Apple but\nit is from an identified developer,\n\n484\n00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.360\nsomeone who's been registered with\nApple and has been digitally signed.\n\n485\n00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.150\nThat's important because\nEl Capitan had a big change.\n\n486\n00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.320\nPrior to El Capitan, even in Yosemite,\n\n487\n00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.400\nthe very last version, you could\ninstall kernel extensions from anybody.\n\n488\n00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.810\nAnybody you wanted,\nyou could just throw them in there.\n\n489\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.160\nBut with El Capitan,\nwe have system integrity protection.\n\n490\n00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.750\nAnd system integrity protection stops you\nfrom installing untrusted extensions.\n\n491\n00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:37.870\nIt stops them from working.\n\n492\n00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.560\nIt's to protect you from malware.\n\n493\n00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.710\nBut it breaks some software.\n\n494\n00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:46.170\nLike I have a software package, let me\nshow you this one, called SwitchResX.\n\n495\n00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.832\nSwitchResX is really cool, cuz it let me\nmanually set the resolution of my monitor\n\n496\n00:23:49.832 --> 00:23:52.498\nand when you share your screen\nlike I do that's important.\n\n497\n00:23:52.498 --> 00:23:56.545\nWell, you can create custom resolutions.\n\n498\n00:23:56.545 --> 00:23:59.672\nI can setup monitor resolutions that\naren't supported by Apple And so\n\n499\n00:23:59.672 --> 00:24:01.527\nit's modifying the video card drivers,\n\n500\n00:24:01.527 --> 00:24:04.630\nit's modifying that kernel\nextension to support it.\n\n501\n00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:08.699\nWell, that worked fine in 10.10 and\nearlier, but in 10.11,\n\n502\n00:24:08.699 --> 00:24:12.315\nI have to disable system integrity\nprotection for this to work.\n\n503\n00:24:12.315 --> 00:24:15.898\nAnd I don't like to do that, and so,\neffectively, this is broken for me.\n\n504\n00:24:15.898 --> 00:24:18.468\nI can use it with standard resolutions,\nbut I can't use it for\n\n505\n00:24:18.468 --> 00:24:22.040\ncustomer resolutions anymore unless\nI weaken the protection on my system.\n\n506\n00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.100\nSo that's a big change, that's important.\n\n507\n00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.040\nAnd so when we look at our\nsystem information here and\n\n508\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.610\nwe see these kernel extensions, we need\nto see Identified Developer on them,\n\n509\n00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.200\notherwise they're not\ngoing to function right.\n\n510\n00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.640\nAnd so\nif we look at some of my other ones,\n\n511\n00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.470\nsee how I've got two here that\nare showing as Not Signed.\n\n512\n00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:38.900\nWhat the heck is that all about?\n\n513\n00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:43.710\nWell, if I look over here, I've got\nLogitechUnifying, that's my track ball,\n\n514\n00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:47.460\nmy Airconsole, IONetworkingFamily,\nand Soundflower.\n\n515\n00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.960\nThese four are Not Signed or Unknown.\n\n516\n00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.520\nHow do I have those?\n\n517\n00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.100\nWell, it's because I upgraded\nfrom Yosemite, and so\n\n518\n00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.810\nthey were kind of grandfathered in.\n\n519\n00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.610\nBut if I tried to install\nthem now they'd be blocked.\n\n520\n00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.930\nSo you might see this\nif you did an upgrade.\n\n521\n00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.880\nHopefully, you see a bunch\nof Identified Developer,\n\n522\n00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.280\nthat's what you really want to see.\n\n523\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.720\nThat means they've been digitally\nsigned and they're trusted.\n\n524\n00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.701\nAnd I can look in here and I can find that\nSANLink extension that I installed, right\n\n525\n00:25:11.701 --> 00:25:16.106\nthere, or the Blackmagic ones, they've all\nbeen signed and they're trusted by Apple.\n\n526\n00:25:16.106 --> 00:25:19.962\nAll right,\nI'm gonna let my system restart, so\n\n527\n00:25:19.962 --> 00:25:25.148\nit's gonna restart which will\nactivate that kernel extension.\n\n528\n00:25:25.148 --> 00:25:30.350\nAnd what we should see is,\nas soon as fires back up, there we go.\n\n529\n00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.150\nSo it's gonna reboot, and as soon as\nthat reboots, what we'll see is that\n\n530\n00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.390\nI can plug in that USB adapter and\nit's gonna started working.\n\n531\n00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:37.720\nThe kernel extension will be there.\n\n532\n00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.930\nSo I'll go back into the system report,\nand\n\n533\n00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.968\nwe should be able to verify that\nkernel extension is present.\n\n534\n00:25:41.968 --> 00:25:44.930\nNow, while we're waiting on that,\nlet's talk about a few other things.\n\n535\n00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:48.100\nThe USB 2.0 device that I held up,\nthat was this Logitech web camera.\n\n536\n00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.150\nThis is a fairly new camera,\nI think we got it last year.\n\n537\n00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.950\nThey still sell them,\nyou can go to the store and buy them.\n\n538\n00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.040\nIt's still actively supported by Logitech.\n\n539\n00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.540\nWell, guess what?\n\n540\n00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.050\nThey don't make a driver for\nMacs, they didn't bother.\n\n541\n00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:04.920\nLogitech figured, hey, every Mac\nhas a built-in camera these days.\n\n542\n00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.486\nAnd if it doesn't, you buy a monitor,\nand the monitor has the built-in camera.\n\n543\n00:26:08.486 --> 00:26:12.930\nSo Mac users don't buy webcams, so\nLogitech never made a driver for it.\n\n544\n00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:16.080\nSo even if I wanted to use this on my Mac,\nI can't.\n\n545\n00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.063\nThere's third parties that have\nwritten kinda kludgy drivers,\n\n546\n00:26:18.063 --> 00:26:19.600\nso they don't work very well.\n\n547\n00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.520\nI just can't use this peripheral.\n\n548\n00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.260\nIf you can't find the driver, then\nyou're not gonna be able to install it.\n\n549\n00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.610\nSo that does happen.\n\n550\n00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:28.670\nAlways research before you buy peripheral\nhardware, it might not be supported.\n\n551\n00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.945\nOther things like your USB hard drives,\nthose are gonna work.\n\n552\n00:26:30.945 --> 00:26:32.530\nYou throw them on, it's gonna be fine.\n\n553\n00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.760\nReally any Thunderbolt device\nis gonna be supported.\n\n554\n00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.570\nI don't think I've had to,\nwell that ten gig Ethernet adapter,\n\n555\n00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.830\nthat was Thunderbolt and\nI had to install a driver for that.\n\n556\n00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.030\nSo that happens, too.\n\n557\n00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:42.380\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n558\n00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.790\nThere's a lot of Apple peripherals.\n\n559\n00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.235\nSo I've got my Apple Wireless Keyboard\nand, I'm pointing backwards.\n\n560\n00:26:47.235 --> 00:26:50.900\n[LAUGH] My Apple Wireless Keyboard and\nmy Magic Pad, right.\n\n561\n00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.660\nSo I use these things, they work great.\n\n562\n00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.090\nThey connect via Bluetooth.\n\n563\n00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.336\nSo they connect via\nBluetooth to the system so\n\n564\n00:26:57.336 --> 00:27:01.610\nI don't need a peripheral port on the\noutside or some crazy connector for that.\n\n565\n00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:05.050\nI just plug that in and it goes.\n\n566\n00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:05.780\nAnd that's that.\n\n567\n00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.860\nI say I plug it in, you don't even plug it\nin, right, it's Bluetooth, it's wireless.\n\n568\n00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.315\nIt just connects in, and that's it.\n\n569\n00:27:11.315 --> 00:27:16.518\nPeripherals that use Bluetooth, that use\ntechnologies like that, are even easier\n\n570\n00:27:16.518 --> 00:27:21.510\nbecause now it's really just software\nthat accesses it, a software language.\n\n571\n00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.760\nWe're not talking to hardware anymore,\nwe're talking to the Bluetooth receiver.\n\n572\n00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.890\nAnd the Bluetooth receiver driver\nis built into Mac OS, all right?\n\n573\n00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.380\nSo that one we don't have to worry about,\n\n574\n00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:34.230\nthose types of connectivities are nice,\neasy to run with.\n\n575\n00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.930\nNow, the devices on\nthe inside of your computer,\n\n576\n00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.620\nthey've got all sorts of other connectors.\n\n577\n00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:43.720\nSo, for example, your hard drives inside\nof your Mac are gonna connect using SATA,\n\n578\n00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.396\nSerial Attached, what is it,\nATA, Serial ATA.\n\n579\n00:27:47.396 --> 00:27:51.652\n[LAUGH] I can't remember\nwhat ATA stands for.\n\n580\n00:27:51.652 --> 00:27:55.850\nIt's like, I don't know, attachment\ntechnology, something like that.\n\n581\n00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:58.730\nSo it's a serial connector, though,\ndesigned for those hard drives.\n\n582\n00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.200\nIf you have SSD, they use SATA also.\n\n583\n00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.450\nYour cards that are built\ninto your system,\n\n584\n00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:08.090\nif you've got a Mac Pro you can actually\nput cards in it, and they use PCI Express.\n\n585\n00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:10.570\nThose are all internal, and\nthose don't really count as peripherals.\n\n586\n00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.940\nPeripherals are really things that are on\nthe outside of your device, right.\n\n587\n00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:17.060\nSo we can add these external devices and\nthen we'll get that connection.\n\n588\n00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.550\nSome of the other things we need to\nthink about is if we do use Bluetooth,\n\n589\n00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:25.060\nBluetooth is wireless and\nit does have an accepted range, right?\n\n590\n00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.356\nIt'll only go about maybe\n30 feet from your device.\n\n591\n00:28:28.356 --> 00:28:31.306\nSo having a wireless keyboard is nice,\nI can walk away from my device and\n\n592\n00:28:31.306 --> 00:28:32.640\nstill use it, right?\n\n593\n00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.260\nBut if I get more than 30 feet away,\nit stops to work, so\n\n594\n00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.540\nwe've got to be careful\nwith limitations like that.\n\n595\n00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.970\nWith USB you've got a cable.\n\n596\n00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.220\nThings directly plug in,\nwe don't have to worry about that range,\n\n597\n00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.720\nyou just get a longer cable.\n\n598\n00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.310\nThere is a limit to how long a USB\ncable can be, but that's it.\n\n599\n00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.860\nI do wanna call out Thunderbolt,\nThunderbolt is a little bit special.\n\n600\n00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.670\nDon't just go and\n\n601\n00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:54.690\nbuy a generic Thunderbolt cable\nthinking that it'll work.\n\n602\n00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.900\nA lot of them are just display port\ncables that don't work for storage,\n\n603\n00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.720\nthey only work for monitors.\n\n604\n00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.710\nWith Thunderbolt there's\nactually logic in the connector.\n\n605\n00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.240\nThere's a little chip that's built\ninto the connector that makes it\n\n606\n00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.410\nidentify to the system and show that\nit is authorized and functioning.\n\n607\n00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:12.530\nSo that's a key thing,\nit's a critical piece for that to work.\n\n608\n00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.730\nAnd that's why Thunderbolt cables are so\nexpensive because they've got to be Apple\n\n609\n00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.410\nlicensed and authorized, and\nthey've gotta contain that chip.\n\n610\n00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.920\nSo it's a rare day that you can find\neven a three foot Thunderbolt cable for\n\n611\n00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.780\nunder $35 because of that\nlogic that's in there.\n\n612\n00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.930\nSo some cables are more\nspecial than others when\n\n613\n00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:27.982\nit comes to peripheral devices.\n\n614\n00:29:27.982 --> 00:29:32.190\nAll right, well,\nit looks like my laptop has rebooted,\n\n615\n00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.890\nso now that network adapter's\nextension should be loaded.\n\n616\n00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:38.990\nWell, it might not be loaded,\nit's definitely recognized.\n\n617\n00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.018\nBut it probably won't load\nuntil I plug in this adapter.\n\n618\n00:29:42.018 --> 00:29:45.080\nSo I'm gonna go and plug in the adapter,\nand we'll see what happens.\n\n619\n00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.395\nMaybe it works,\nmaybe it doesn't, all right?\n\n620\n00:29:46.395 --> 00:29:49.445\nSo let me just get that plugged in,\nthere we go.\n\n621\n00:29:49.445 --> 00:29:52.037\nAnd let me, sorry,\nI unplugged my monitor, too,\n\n622\n00:29:52.037 --> 00:29:55.695\nlet me get that plugged back in otherwise\nwe're not gonna see very much here.\n\n623\n00:29:55.695 --> 00:29:59.885\nAll right, so I'm plugging in my USB\nadapter, how do I know if it's working?\n\n624\n00:29:59.885 --> 00:30:01.765\nWell, I could plug it in, right?\n\n625\n00:30:01.765 --> 00:30:06.213\nUSB adapters they always show up as\ndisconnected until you plug a cable in and\n\n626\n00:30:06.213 --> 00:30:07.615\nget link lights.\n\n627\n00:30:07.615 --> 00:30:12.363\nSo I'm gonna plug it in, and I'm gonna\ngo into my System Preferences and\n\n628\n00:30:12.363 --> 00:30:17.840\nI'm gonna go into Network, and I'm gonna\nsee if this little adapter shows up.\n\n629\n00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.860\nAnd so far it's not looking good.\n\n630\n00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.790\nI've got it plugged in and it's not here,\nright, it's not in the list.\n\n631\n00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:27.350\nAnd looking at the adapter, I don't\nknow if it has link lights on it or not.\n\n632\n00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:30.020\nI don't see any lights flashing or\nanything.\n\n633\n00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.190\nIt doesn't look like it's working.\n\n634\n00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:33.910\nWell, how do I know?\n\n635\n00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:37.190\nWell, the driver was for\n10.10 and I am on 10.11.\n\n636\n00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:40.534\nIt may not have installed,\nit may not be supported,\n\n637\n00:30:40.534 --> 00:30:45.035\nit may not be recognized,\nit could be getting kicked out, all right.\n\n638\n00:30:45.035 --> 00:30:48.855\nAnd it very likely is because that big\ndifference happened in El Capitan,\n\n639\n00:30:48.855 --> 00:30:50.295\nthat's a big thing.\n\n640\n00:30:50.295 --> 00:30:52.765\nSo looking at this,\nI'm just kind of pausing for\n\n641\n00:30:52.765 --> 00:30:55.895\na minute here because sometimes network\nadapters take a minute to be detected, but\n\n642\n00:30:55.895 --> 00:30:57.675\nit looks like it's not showing up.\n\n643\n00:30:57.675 --> 00:30:58.965\nHow can I verify that?\n\n644\n00:30:58.965 --> 00:31:00.765\nWell, the system report's the best way.\n\n645\n00:31:00.765 --> 00:31:03.876\nSo if I go to About this Mac,\nand I go to my System Report,\n\n646\n00:31:03.876 --> 00:31:05.850\nI can look at my hardware.\n\n647\n00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.850\nAnd under Hardware, you've got USB and\n\n648\n00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:12.120\nyou can see all the USB\ndevices that are plugged in.\n\n649\n00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.214\nI see my card reader, that's the SD card.\n\n650\n00:31:14.214 --> 00:31:17.155\nI see AX88179.\n\n651\n00:31:17.155 --> 00:31:19.830\nWhat is that?\n\n652\n00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:21.840\nI don't know, right,\nI don't know what that is.\n\n653\n00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.950\nActually, I'm pretty sure it's the USB\nnetwork adapter, but it may not be.\n\n654\n00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:26.580\nI don't really know what that is.\n\n655\n00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.500\nI've got my Apple Internal Keyboard and\nTrackpad.\n\n656\n00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.020\nThat's just built into the laptop.\n\n657\n00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.850\nAnd then I've got my\nBluetooth USB Host Controller.\n\n658\n00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.190\nSo most of these are devices\nthat are built into my laptop.\n\n659\n00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:39.210\nBut I've got this AX88179,\nI don't know what that is.\n\n660\n00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:43.950\nAnd as I look down here,\nit's showing ASIX Electronics Corp, but\n\n661\n00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:46.190\nlooking at the adapter,\nit's make by Anchor.\n\n662\n00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:47.150\nIs that it?\n\n663\n00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.390\nEasier way to find out,\njust unplug the darn thing.\n\n664\n00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:54.144\nIf I unplug it, right,\nin theory that AX8A179 should go away.\n\n665\n00:31:54.144 --> 00:31:55.845\nAnd so if I see it disappear, now,\n\n666\n00:31:55.845 --> 00:31:59.830\nthis screen doesn't always refresh\non its own so I'm gonna close it.\n\n667\n00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.648\nAnd go right back into it,\nso it refreshes.\n\n668\n00:32:02.648 --> 00:32:06.810\nAnd I'll go back to USB and\nAXA at 179 is gone.\n\n669\n00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:07.990\nAll right.\n\n670\n00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.790\nSo it's gone.\n\n671\n00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.560\nThat tells me that it was my USB adapter.\n\n672\n00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.730\nAnd it also tells me that it\nwas recognized by the system.\n\n673\n00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:18.340\nThe system did see it because\nit showed up right here.\n\n674\n00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.050\nBut it's not working, right.\n\n675\n00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.720\nThat's because I'm looking at it\nhere from the hardware perspective.\n\n676\n00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.610\nSo the USB bus recognizes that\nsomething's plugged into it, but\n\n677\n00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.740\nit's not necessarily able to use it.\n\n678\n00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.220\nWe'll see that under software.\n\n679\n00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:36.900\nSo if I go back into my system repair\nport, and I go down here, you've\n\n680\n00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.260\ngot Network, and information there, but\nthat's not actually what I'm looking for.\n\n681\n00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.340\nI'm looking down here for my Extensions.\n\n682\n00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.790\nAnd what I wanna see is I wanna see\nthe extension from Anker that's\n\n683\n00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.540\nin here loaded and recognized.\n\n684\n00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.850\nIf it's not in the list,\nthen it's not going to work.\n\n685\n00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:58.490\nAnd I don't necessarily have to\nwait on that screen to refresh.\n\n686\n00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:03.660\nIf I drop down to my terminal,\nI can jump into /libraries/extensions and\n\n687\n00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.560\nwe can take a look at what's in there.\n\n688\n00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:10.170\nAnd when I take a look at that list,\nI'm looking and\n\n689\n00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.900\nI don't see anything different\nthan when we were in here before.\n\n690\n00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.700\nAnd I already know what's happened.\n\n691\n00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.800\nLet's just sort these by date here and\nsee if there's anything dated today.\n\n692\n00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.800\nToday is dated April 6th, and\nso I've got some stuff from\n\n693\n00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:29.485\nApril 1st when I installed something but\nI don't see anything from today.\n\n694\n00:33:29.485 --> 00:33:30.436\nThe extension's not here.\n\n695\n00:33:30.436 --> 00:33:34.380\nIf the extension's not here\nthe adapter's not gonna work, and\n\n696\n00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:38.280\nthe reason it's not here, more than\nlikely system integrity protection\n\n697\n00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.900\nthat have said, hey you're trying\nto put in this unsigned driver,\n\n698\n00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:45.480\nwe're not gonna load it, it kicks it out\nand the adapter doesn't work, all right.\n\n699\n00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.150\nSo that's something we definitely have\nto pay attention to in El Capital.\n\n700\n00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:51.390\nJust because a driver says that it's for\nMac, and\n\n701\n00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:55.300\njust because it says it's 10.10 it\ndoesn't mean it's going to work in 10.11.\n\n702\n00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.769\nThat's a big change that happened.\n\n703\n00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:01.750\nAll right, let's see what else\ndo I wanna mention on this one\n\n704\n00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.690\nthe main part there was system\ninformation being able to recognize\n\n705\n00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.550\nthe Coronel extensions that are loaded.\n\n706\n00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:10.080\nThere's one other thing that you might\nwanna to poke around within here's\n\n707\n00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.640\nin the system report under hardware\nI would straight to USB but\n\n708\n00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.180\nthere's Thunderbolt right.\n\n709\n00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.970\nAnd you can see Thunderbolt devices that\nare plugged in I've got my Thunderbolt\n\n710\n00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:20.410\nto Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.\n\n711\n00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:22.440\nRight there's a network adapter\nthat I can actually using.\n\n712\n00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.420\nThat one shows up and\nworks and it's right here.\n\n713\n00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.770\nYou've also got all your other busses.\n\n714\n00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:29.920\nFor storage you're normally\nsee that on the SATA.\n\n715\n00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.830\nSo when I look at my SATA Express I\nlook up here and I see my SSD, right.\n\n716\n00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.160\nThat's the hard drive that's\nbuild into the laptop.\n\n717\n00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.280\nThis hard drive is SATA also,\n\n718\n00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.630\nif I were to crack open this case on\nthe inside it's a serial ATA connector.\n\n719\n00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:46.430\nBut it's got this USB three adapter,\nlet me add this to my system.\n\n720\n00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:51.600\nI'm gonna plug this in real quick and just\nto make sure I get a good fresh screen,\n\n721\n00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.268\nI'm gonna close out of that system\nreport and I'll go back into it.\n\n722\n00:34:55.268 --> 00:34:57.020\nActually, I'm gonna wait just a second for\n\n723\n00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.940\nthat hard drive to appear\nhere on my desktop.\n\n724\n00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.550\nSo the hard drive is plugged in but\n\n725\n00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.810\nit can take the system just a moment\nto recognize that and show it up.\n\n726\n00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:11.660\nThis is my time machine drive and\nusually it shows up faster than this.\n\n727\n00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:16.330\nHang on, let me relocate that\nreal quick to my other port.\n\n728\n00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.640\nAnd plug that in.\n\n729\n00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.990\nIf this doesn't show up I can wait just\na minute by see that little light flashing\n\n730\n00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:24.240\non my drive, so\nit should be recognizing it.\n\n731\n00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.360\nDiscs you can always monitor\nfrom inside of the disc utility.\n\n732\n00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.210\nAnd you should see them show up in there.\n\n733\n00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.000\nIt is my Time Machine, it's just I think\nI improperly unplugged it earlier.\n\n734\n00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.060\nSo it's probably running like a file\nsystem check, so I'll give it a second for\n\n735\n00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.220\nthat to turn up.\n\n736\n00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.970\nIt's a Serial ATA drive, but\nbecause there's a USB adapter on it,\n\n737\n00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:46.390\nit's gonna show up as a USB device,\nnot a serial ATA device.\n\n738\n00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:48.940\nIt's being translated by USB.\n\n739\n00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.270\nSo just be aware that sometimes there\ncan be more than one technology in\n\n740\n00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:53.880\nplay when you connect an extension.\n\n741\n00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.710\nThere we go.\n\n742\n00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:56.730\nSo there my time machine\ndrive just turned up.\n\n743\n00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:57.680\nThere it is.\n\n744\n00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.530\nAnd if I go back to my system report and\nI go and\n\n745\n00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:06.460\nlook at serial ATA I still\nonly see my SSD and that's it.\n\n746\n00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.470\nBut if I go down to USB,\n\n747\n00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:13.230\nunder USB I now see my\nWestern Digital Elements hard drive.\n\n748\n00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:15.560\nAnd I can look down here and\nsee information about that hard drive.\n\n749\n00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.100\nDrive.\n\n750\n00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:20.370\nYes it it serial ATA on the inside but\nit's connected via USB, so\n\n751\n00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:21.990\nthat's where I see it, right.\n\n752\n00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:26.040\nThunderbolt's another great place to\ngo for that SATA for internal storage.\n\n753\n00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.860\nYou'll usually see that.\n\n754\n00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.585\nYou got printers in here Parallel SCSI,\nyou really don't see on Macs anymore.\n\n755\n00:36:31.585 --> 00:36:35.955\nThe old old iMacs, the ones that were\ncolorful those used SCSI on the inside.\n\n756\n00:36:35.955 --> 00:36:39.695\nAll the really old Macs,\nif you ever used the SE20s or\n\n757\n00:36:39.695 --> 00:36:43.115\nthe Quadras,\nthose guys all had SCSI storage in them.\n\n758\n00:36:43.115 --> 00:36:45.430\nApple went to SATA many many years ago.\n\n759\n00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:48.600\nPCI, that's where you'll start\nto see cards that are inserted.\n\n760\n00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.260\nSo if you had a built-in\nadapter of some sort.\n\n761\n00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.870\nYou'll have your memory,\nyour other things there.\n\n762\n00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.780\nBut you don't really add things to memory.\n\n763\n00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.860\nFireWire, I don't have a FireWire port.\n\n764\n00:36:58.860 --> 00:36:59.720\nSo that's not gonna work for me.\n\n765\n00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.170\nBut if I had FireWire devices\nthey would show up here.\n\n766\n00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:04.790\nAnd then he also got your\ncard reader that turns up.\n\n767\n00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.670\nYou got that built in SD card\nreader that shows up here.\n\n768\n00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:11.520\nCamera, your Bluetooth and\nBluetooth devices that are attached.\n\n769\n00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.210\nThey all kinda get listed down here.\n\n770\n00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:16.620\nYou'll see things like my\nDon Pezet's Trackpad work.\n\n771\n00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.220\nActually, I have two Magic Pads.\n\n772\n00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.350\nOne here at the office and one at home,\nso I have to label them that way.\n\n773\n00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:25.790\nSo this is my work one that shows up,\nso I can see those and they're visible.\n\n774\n00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:27.240\nUnder ATA, I don't see anything.\n\n775\n00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.820\nThose are the really old\nparallel ATA drives.\n\n776\n00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.550\nSerial ATA is what we use now, so that's\nwhy all the storage is under Serial ATA,\n\n777\n00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:34.920\nand that's where we'll spot those.\n\n778\n00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.220\nSo there's many different bus types inside\nof your Mac, and depending on which bus\n\n779\n00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.570\nyou plug a device in it may show up under\none of those different ones, all right.\n\n780\n00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:47.630\nJust be aware, having hardware is one\nthing, having the bus is another but\n\n781\n00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:48.680\nwe've gotta have a driver.\n\n782\n00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.790\nYou've gotta have a kernel\nextension to make it all work.\n\n783\n00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:54.260\nAnd without that, you end up like my\nnetwork card here, no link lights,\n\n784\n00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.870\nI can't talk on the network, right.\n\n785\n00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:59.170\nSo that's the key thing to\nremember about peripherals.\n\n786\n00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:03.505\nWell I took what's as simple as plugging\nin a USB cable and turned it into a 30\n\n787\n00:38:03.505 --> 00:38:06.775\nminute episode here, so it's probably\na good spot for me to wrap up on that one.\n\n788\n00:38:06.775 --> 00:38:09.775\nIt is important on the exam,\nabsolutely remember,\n\n789\n00:38:09.775 --> 00:38:12.615\nsystem integrity protection is important.\n\n790\n00:38:12.615 --> 00:38:15.335\nEl Capitan requires drivers\nthat are designed to work\n\n791\n00:38:15.335 --> 00:38:16.995\nwith system integrity protection.\n\n792\n00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:19.485\nIf they aren't, they just don't work.\n\n793\n00:38:19.485 --> 00:38:20.530\nAbsolutely be aware of that.\n\n794\n00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:23.060\nAll right, well ladies and gentleman\nthis is a good spot to wrap this up.\n\n795\n00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.780\nIn this episode we went over\nour peripheral devices,\n\n796\n00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.710\nsome of the different buses we\ncould use to get connected.\n\n797\n00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:32.240\nWe got them in place, they're up and\ngoing and we saw how to report on that.\n\n798\n00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.120\nSo pretty much a good wrap on that one.\n\n799\n00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.410\nSo right here I'll go and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n800\n00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:40.796\nI've been your host Don Pezet and\nI'll see you next time.\n\n801\n00:38:40.796 --> 00:38:48.360\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.431\nand welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:19.130\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.090\nBack again with another episode of Apple\ncertified support professional and\n\n6\n00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.990\nI'm back by my lonesome again, Daniel\nhad to be pulled off for another show.\n\n7\n00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.060\nBut that's okay.\n\n8\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.710\nCuz we're kind of winding down on ACSP.\n\n9\n00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.860\nWe've only got a couple episodes left and\n\n10\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.230\nin this episode,\nit's a flash from the past.\n\n11\n00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.200\nWe're gonna reach back in time to\nthe days where printers were relevant.\n\n12\n00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200\nThat's right,\nwe're gonna talk about support printers.\n\n13\n00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.250\nAnd I know, for someone like myself,\nand probably like you,\n\n14\n00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.990\nwe really don't use printers\nnearly as much as we used to.\n\n15\n00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.860\nBut they are still out there and they\nare still important to a lot of people.\n\n16\n00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.900\nThere are many people out there that,\ntheir printer goes down,\n\n17\n00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.390\nthat's the end of their work day.\n\n18\n00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.050\nIt's so important for them to have that.\n\n19\n00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.120\nThen a lot of times they wouldn't even\ncomplain about their computer being slow.\n\n20\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.110\nBut the moment their printer doesn't work,\nyou'll never hear the end of it.\n\n21\n00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.790\nThere's all over you about\ngetting that printer.\n\n22\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.590\nIt happens,\nit is still important to people and\n\n23\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.290\nso we need to be able to\nsupport those inside of Mac OS.\n\n24\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.670\nNow, in OS10 there's all sorts of\nfeatures that try to make where you don't\n\n25\n00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.380\nneed a printer.\n\n26\n00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.360\nFor example every application inside\nof OS10 can save their output as a PDF.\n\n27\n00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.220\nSo you can create electronic documents\nright from inside of the OS,\n\n28\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.420\nyou never have to mess with printers.\n\n29\n00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.050\nBut if you're in one of those\norganizations where you still need\n\n30\n00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.970\nprinters, you still need that support,\n\n31\n00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.280\nyou're gonna have to\nknow how to handle those.\n\n32\n00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.420\nI say I don't use printers but\nI'll tell you every day I\n\n33\n00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.140\nprint my show notes before the show so\nI know what I talk about.\n\n34\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.330\nAnd to have that as a piece of paper\nsitting right here in front of me,\n\n35\n00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.665\nthat keeps me on track and\nmake sure I know to talk about.\n\n36\n00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:47.045\nSo even I still use printers\neven though personally,\n\n37\n00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:50.455\nlike outside of the show,\neverything I do is electronic.\n\n38\n00:01:50.455 --> 00:01:54.505\nNow, the printing inside of Mac OS\nactually has a neat little history to it.\n\n39\n00:01:54.505 --> 00:01:57.695\nBecause remember I know I've mentioned\nit more than once on the show,\n\n40\n00:01:57.695 --> 00:02:01.705\nis that while we look at Mac OS we see\nthis nice graphical user interface,\n\n41\n00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:03.125\nit super easy to use.\n\n42\n00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:06.580\nThat under the hood, It's BSD Unix.\n\n43\n00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.650\nSo it's running an operating\nsystem that was developed back in\n\n44\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.380\nthe 1970s that was commandline only.\n\n45\n00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.220\nAnd it makes it pretty amazing,\ndoesn't it?\n\n46\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.580\nYou wouldn't know that from looking at it.\n\n47\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.770\nBut it's technology that's been around\na long time that's very tried and true and\n\n48\n00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.330\nvery stable.\n\n49\n00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.140\nBut, one of the big\nproblems in the Unix-world\n\n50\n00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.210\nwas it was originally developed for\nservers.\n\n51\n00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.250\nIt wasn't designed for end-users like us.\n\n52\n00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.210\nWhere people that have workstations,\nand laptops, and mobile devices.\n\n53\n00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.690\nIt wasn't designed for that.\n\n54\n00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.790\nAnd so in the Unix-world,\nas those operating systems progressed and\n\n55\n00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.950\nstarted to be used for desktops.\n\n56\n00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.920\nWe started to see this real problem.\n\n57\n00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.570\nThe problem came with hardware support.\n\n58\n00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.420\nIf I'm a manufacturer and I decide\nthat I'm going to make a new printer.\n\n59\n00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.310\nWell, computers need to know\nhow to talk to my printer and\n\n60\n00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.910\nthere's several different languages\nout there that printers talk.\n\n61\n00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.630\nSo in order for\n\n62\n00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.100\na computer to talk to my printer I'm\ngoing to have to write some software.\n\n63\n00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.570\nI'm going to have to write a little driver\n\n64\n00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.866\nthat tells the computer\nhow to talk to my printer.\n\n65\n00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:05.400\nAnd if I'm gonna have to go through\nthe trouble of creating a driver,\n\n66\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.460\nI'm gonna look at who the number\none operating system is out there.\n\n67\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.810\nAnd in the business and the home world,\n\n68\n00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.900\nright now,\nMicrosoft Windows has that market share.\n\n69\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.200\nSo every printer,\nif you go to the store and\n\n70\n00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.249\nbuy a printer, every printer will\nhave drivers for Microsoft Windows.\n\n71\n00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.880\nBut very few of them will have drivers for\nLinux or\n\n72\n00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.400\nUnix, because people don't run Linux and\nUnix at home on their computer or\n\n73\n00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.100\neven at their office, for the most part.\n\n74\n00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.330\nThey just aren't that widely deployed.\n\n75\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.440\nSo, when Apple decided to switch Mac OS\nfrom being proprietary to being based\n\n76\n00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.720\non BSD,\nthey had a real problem with printing.\n\n77\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.200\nAnd instead of coming up with\nsomething crazy, it's isolated and\n\n78\n00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.920\nunique to Apple,\nthey did something really neat.\n\n79\n00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.175\nApple formed an organization,\nthey created a product called CUPS.\n\n80\n00:03:51.175 --> 00:03:55.315\nWhich is the common UNIX printing system.\n\n81\n00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:59.545\nAnd the common UNIX printing system was\ndesigned to allow UNIX based systems,\n\n82\n00:03:59.545 --> 00:04:03.035\nnot just UNIX, but BSD micros, LINUX and\n\n83\n00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:07.035\nanybody was based on an infrastructure\nto be able to easily print to printers.\n\n84\n00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:11.400\nNow a manufacturer could write one driver.\n\n85\n00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.530\nRight one caps driver and\nthat would allow Linux users to print ESD,\n\n86\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.640\nUnix and MAc they can knock\nall those OSs all at once.\n\n87\n00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.370\nSo if I'm a manufacturer now and\nI go to create a printer and\n\n88\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.850\nI know I have the right software.\n\n89\n00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.410\nWell yeah I'm gonna create a Windows\ndriver that's a given you gotta support\n\n90\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.310\nthe major user base out there.\n\n91\n00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.640\nBut now I can write one caps driver.\n\n92\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.440\nAnd that will enable everybody else to\nprint all the other major operating\n\n93\n00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.920\nsystems that are out there.\n\n94\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.800\nSo Apple developed this in-house and\nthey very well could have\n\n95\n00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.430\njust kept it to themselves and\nsay, yeah this is an Apple thing.\n\n96\n00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.080\nAnd so now if a developer\nwants to write a driver for\n\n97\n00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.260\na printer they can write it for\nApple's system.\n\n98\n00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.080\nBut instead,\nApple gave it back to the community.\n\n99\n00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.980\nAnd they said,\nhere we just created this printing system.\n\n100\n00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.330\nIf you guys use it, too, and\nwe use it, we could group together and\n\n101\n00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.160\nnow we are a bigger part\nof that market share.\n\n102\n00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.470\nAnd boy, did it really take off.\n\n103\n00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.120\nAnd so if you deploy any of\nthe Linux distributions like Ubuntu,\n\n104\n00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.520\nDebian, Red Hats, CentOS,\nany of those guys.\n\n105\n00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.300\nIf you deploy true Unix, which really I\ndon't think you can truly do anymore.\n\n106\n00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.730\nSCO Unix was the last\ntrue version of Unix.\n\n107\n00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:20.150\nBut BSD, the FreeBSD, NetBSD,\nOpenBSD or Mac OS, OS 10.\n\n108\n00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.040\nAnd really, it's been this way since OS X\nin the early days when it switched over to\n\n109\n00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.110\nbeing BSD-based,\nthat all of those use CUPS.\n\n110\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.060\nThey all use it,\nthey all use that same printer driver.\n\n111\n00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.290\nAnd that makes it super convenient.\n\n112\n00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.470\nSo, when we go to attach\na printer to our system.\n\n113\n00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.060\nWe may or may not need that driver.\n\n114\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.840\nApple may have already built\nin support for your printer.\n\n115\n00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.990\nFor example, Apple has a really\nclose relationship with HP.\n\n116\n00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.450\nAnd so, every time HP puts out a new\nprinter, HP shares the driver information\n\n117\n00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.620\nwith Apple, and Apple builds the printer\ndriver into the operating system.\n\n118\n00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.530\nSo when you plug in a Hewlett Packard\nprinter into your Mac,\n\n119\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.750\nit's almost always supported right out of\nthe box, you don't have to load drivers.\n\n120\n00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.310\nIt's kind of nice.\n\n121\n00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.620\nBut if it's not,\n\n122\n00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.690\nif you have a printer from some\nbrand that you've never heard of.\n\n123\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.880\nSo Don brand printer, right?\n\n124\n00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.950\nAnd you buy my printer that I just\nsold you Apple doesn't know who I am.\n\n125\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.180\nThey don't have that built in\nto their operating system.\n\n126\n00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.500\nSo you'll need to go out and get a driver.\n\n127\n00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.070\nAnd so that's the first thing that\nI want to point out is that not\n\n128\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.100\nevery printer needs a driver but\nmany of them do.\n\n129\n00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.980\nAnd so if we need to get it we've\ngot to go to the web site and\n\n130\n00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:26.700\nwe've got to find it.\n\n131\n00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.460\nSo for example, here in our office.\n\n132\n00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.710\nI never use it, but we have this gigantic\noffice printer that the business side of\n\n133\n00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.878\nthe company uses and\nit prints this thing like crazy.\n\n134\n00:06:35.878 --> 00:06:39.510\nDifferent thousands of pages and\nanything, multi sided and\n\n135\n00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.760\nit's got like a booklet attachment so\nit can do pamphlets and a stapler and\n\n136\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.600\na hole puncher and all sorts of\nmagic built into this printer.\n\n137\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.720\nIt's a lot more than\njust a regular printer.\n\n138\n00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.230\nSo if your computer is expecting to print\nin just a regular old printer that's fine,\n\n139\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.230\nbut if you've got a stapler and\n\n140\n00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.220\nhole puncher built in your printer how\ndid your computer know to use that?\n\n141\n00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.920\nYou gonna have to get a driver for that.\n\n142\n00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.790\nSo let's go and find one of those drivers,\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm wanna pull out\n\n143\n00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.260\nCanon website I pulled\nit up before the show.\n\n144\n00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.420\nAnd here is the printer that we have\nlike I said it's a gigantic thing,\n\n145\n00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.830\nthis master printer.\n\n146\n00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.420\nAnd it's got all sorts of bells and\n\n147\n00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.950\nwhistles in it now we don't\nhave whatever this box is but\n\n148\n00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:20.110\nwe've got the rest of it and it can staple\nand hole punch and all that craziness.\n\n149\n00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.240\nSo we're gonna need a driver for it and\nwhen I go to the Website and look for\n\n150\n00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.810\ndrivers, well it gives me\ninformation about the printer and\n\n151\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.990\nI can go to Drivers & Downloads and\nit's detecting my operating system.\n\n152\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.780\nAnd so, I can see right here it\ndetected I'm running OS X El Capitan.\n\n153\n00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.540\nAnd so, some manufacturers have\nreally good support for that.\n\n154\n00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.450\nIf you look, these guys, they've been\nsupporting printers a long time.\n\n155\n00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.070\nYou see OS8, OS9,\nwhich are ancient these days.\n\n156\n00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.500\nOS10, and\nall the various versions of OS10.\n\n157\n00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.850\nThis is almost like\na history of large cats.\n\n158\n00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.400\nSo [LAUGH] you can go back and\nlook at all of those.\n\n159\n00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.385\nBut you'll see the other operating\nsystems here like Linux 64bit,\n\n160\n00:07:58.385 --> 00:07:59.556\nLinux 32bit, and so on.\n\n161\n00:07:59.556 --> 00:08:02.350\nThese are all drivers for\ndifferent operating systems.\n\n162\n00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.066\nAnd of course,\n\n163\n00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:06.658\nyou always see a big selection of Windows\ncuz that one's gonna be supported.\n\n164\n00:08:06.658 --> 00:08:08.530\nBut then when you start\ngetting into Mac and\n\n165\n00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.188\nLinux is where things get a little\nbit more iffy, all right.\n\n166\n00:08:11.188 --> 00:08:12.635\nNow, when I first click on it,\n\n167\n00:08:12.635 --> 00:08:15.420\nsee where it says no recommended\ndownload for the OS?\n\n168\n00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.210\nWell, that's not always true.\n\n169\n00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.520\nIt just means they haven't necessarily\nmatched it up and if I click on drivers,\n\n170\n00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.470\nright off the bat I can see where there's\nall these Mac drivers that are here.\n\n171\n00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:29.940\nThe one that I'm looking for\nis this guy right here, this PPD.\n\n172\n00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.750\nAll right, PPDs,\nthose are printer definition files.\n\n173\n00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.300\nWith CUPS, with the Unix printing system,\nthat Common Unix Printing System,\n\n174\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.290\nCUPS uses PPD files that define how to\ntalk to the printers or the drivers.\n\n175\n00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.370\nSo this PPD is really all I need.\n\n176\n00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.850\nIf I have the PPD, it will tell\nme how to format documents and\n\n177\n00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.010\nimages to send to that printer.\n\n178\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.960\nAnd make it print usually what we want.\n\n179\n00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.888\nProblem is that printer\nmight do a lot more.\n\n180\n00:08:57.888 --> 00:09:01.764\nIt might do things like scanning and\nhole punching and staplingm and\n\n181\n00:09:01.764 --> 00:09:05.110\nthat's stuff that a printer\ndoesn't normally do.\n\n182\n00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:09.478\nSo the PPD file doesn't usually include\nall of those extra instructions.\n\n183\n00:09:09.478 --> 00:09:12.838\nAnd so a accompanying with it there\nmaybe a software package of some sort.\n\n184\n00:09:12.838 --> 00:09:15.736\nAnd that's where if you start to look\nat some of these other files we'll see\n\n185\n00:09:15.736 --> 00:09:16.780\ndifferent things.\n\n186\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.560\nWe've got fax.\n\n187\n00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.230\nIt's got a fax modem in it.\n\n188\n00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.610\nI can scan something and fax it out, or\nI can print something in the printer and\n\n189\n00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.070\nhave it fax something to a destination.\n\n190\n00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.590\nPPDs can't define that so\nit's got a dedicated fax driver for that.\n\n191\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.760\nYou've got PS and sometimes you'll\nsee PCL PS is post script, and\n\n192\n00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.800\nPCL is the printer control language.\n\n193\n00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.670\nThose are two different languages\nwe can speak to the printer.\n\n194\n00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.790\nYour printer might have built in\nfonts that enable it to print more\n\n195\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.030\ncrisp and clear.\n\n196\n00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.970\nIn which case the vendor might tell\nyou hey you need to use PCL when you\n\n197\n00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.620\nyou talk to this printer, or you needed\nto use PS to identify those fonts.\n\n198\n00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.110\nAnd then this one is this\nuniversal print system, UFRII.\n\n199\n00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.070\nThat's a Canon thing.\n\n200\n00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.950\nI don't actually know\nwhat that stands for, but\n\n201\n00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:00.160\nit's a universal driver they have that has\nsupport for all the bells and whistles.\n\n202\n00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.070\nThe stapler, the hole puncher,\nall that crazy stuff?\n\n203\n00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.910\nThe UFRII one will have it.\n\n204\n00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.920\nBut it's universal not from the point\nof stance of an operating system.\n\n205\n00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.530\nIt's universal for their printers.\n\n206\n00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:16.180\nIn other words, every Canon printer is\nsupported by this driver right here.\n\n207\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.160\nYou can get one driver.\n\n208\n00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.630\nAnd it runs all the printers.\n\n209\n00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.550\nWhat it actually is is a file that\ncontains about 80 different PPD files, and\n\n210\n00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.580\nall of the other instructions\nthat are a part of it.\n\n211\n00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.860\nBut all we really need to print\nIs this guy right here, the PPD.\n\n212\n00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:34.050\nThe PPD is the driver that lets us talk\nto that printer and send data to it.\n\n213\n00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.310\nNow Apple's already packaged a lot\nof PPDs with the operating system.\n\n214\n00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.980\nSo, if it's a proprietary printer that's\nspecial and not supported by the OS,\n\n215\n00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.340\nthen we can go here and\ndownload it and install it.\n\n216\n00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.690\nIf it's a common printer though,\n\n217\n00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.770\nwe might just be able to connect to it and\nrun with it.\n\n218\n00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.000\nSo we have another printer here\nin the studio that's an HP, and\n\n219\n00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.570\nI mentioned how HP has a really\nclose relationship with Apple.\n\n220\n00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.260\nThey share a lot of their driver\ninformation so it's built into the OS.\n\n221\n00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.760\nSo if I want to add that printer\nhere on the network, I can do it and\n\n222\n00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.720\nI probably won't have to give it a driver.\n\n223\n00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.670\nRight, let me show you that process.\n\n224\n00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.650\nIf you want to add a printer,\nyou just go into System Preferences.\n\n225\n00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.880\nAnd in your System Preferences\nyou'll see Printers & Scanners.\n\n226\n00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.950\nAnd when we go into Printers & Scanners\nyou'll see all the printers and\n\n227\n00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:16.790\nscanners that you have.\n\n228\n00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.210\nI have a blazing none, I don't have any.\n\n229\n00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.350\nSo I need to add some printers here so\n\n230\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.240\nthat I'll be able to get to them and\nconnect.\n\n231\n00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.460\nNow to add a printer, there's a few\ndifferent ways we can go about it.\n\n232\n00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.010\nIf it's a physically connected printer,\n\n233\n00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:34.000\nthen it will have a USB cable or,\nhopefully not, but\n\n234\n00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.270\nif it's ancient like a parallel cable, but\nmost of them have a USB cable these days.\n\n235\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.590\nAnd you just plug the USB cable into\nyour computer, it'll detect it and\n\n236\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.540\nit will add it right here.\n\n237\n00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.620\nBut I'm not filming this episode in 1997.\n\n238\n00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.850\nMost of us don't have printers that\ndirectly plug into our computers anymore.\n\n239\n00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.410\nMost of us have network printers.\n\n240\n00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:54.140\nPrinters that are on the wireless network,\nor plugged into your physical network and\n\n241\n00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.270\nso that all of your computers can see it.\n\n242\n00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.870\nAnd so if you have a printer that's on\na network you have to tell it about it.\n\n243\n00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.048\nNow, your computer is gonna run Bonjour.\n\n244\n00:12:02.048 --> 00:12:04.431\nAnd it's going to be scanning\nthe network and looking for\n\n245\n00:12:04.431 --> 00:12:05.678\nprinters that are out there.\n\n246\n00:12:05.678 --> 00:12:07.778\nSo you may see printers in\nhere that you didn't add,\n\n247\n00:12:07.778 --> 00:12:10.150\nones that have just been\ndiscovered on the network.\n\n248\n00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.670\nBut see how mine says that\nno printers are available?\n\n249\n00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.340\nWhy aren't any printers available?\n\n250\n00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.370\nWell I can look right up here and\nI'm not on the wireless network.\n\n251\n00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.470\nI'm not connected to the ITProTV studios,\nand\n\n252\n00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:26.160\nso I'm not getting connected, I can't\nsee those printers that are out there.\n\n253\n00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.030\nSo let me get connected to that\nwireless network real quick so\n\n254\n00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.000\nthat I will be able to see it.\n\n255\n00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.400\nSo I'm going to get connected into\n\n256\n00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:38.240\nthe old ITProTV it's going to need\na password which I think I remember.\n\n257\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.390\nIt has been a little while since\nI've connected to this one.\n\n258\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.320\nAnd that's going to connect.\n\n259\n00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.070\nAnd as soon as it connects, I'm going to\nstart exploring the network for printers.\n\n260\n00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:47.860\nI'm not doing it.\n\n261\n00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.960\nIt's Bonjour in the background.\n\n262\n00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.560\nThat's what it does.\n\n263\n00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.420\nIt goes out and looks to find things.\n\n264\n00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.770\nAfter a while, it may show up here, okay.\n\n265\n00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.280\nIf it doesn't,\nI can always go down here and\n\n266\n00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.290\nhad the + sign and you'll see where\nwe can add a printer or a scanner in.\n\n267\n00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.450\nActually, there it goes.\n\n268\n00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.370\nIt's detecting.\n\n269\n00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.370\nIt sees an HP LaserJet 400 M401dne.\n\n270\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:06.750\nRolls right off the tongue.\n\n271\n00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.720\nAnd Tim Color Laser, right?\n\n272\n00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.990\nThis one, this HP LaserJet,\nthat's our printer.\n\n273\n00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.740\nIt's the one I printed my\nshow notes on this morning.\n\n274\n00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.080\nIt's sitting right out here in the studio.\n\n275\n00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.590\nIt's at our editor station.\n\n276\n00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.990\nThere's another one.\n\n277\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.030\nThat's Tim,\none of the cofounders of ITProTV.\n\n278\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.720\nThat's his office.\n\n279\n00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.920\nIt's across the building.\n\n280\n00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.550\nHis printer shows up, so\nI can send some stuff to his printer.\n\n281\n00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.770\nBut let's say I wanna print to this HP.\n\n282\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.150\nI don't actually remember what Tim's is,\nso I'm gonna go with this one,\n\n283\n00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.230\ncuz I know HP's are usually build in.\n\n284\n00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.980\nSo, I'm gonna choose that,\nand when it does, see\n\n285\n00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:38.160\nhow it says setting up 'HP LaserJet 400.'\nConfiguring the device, adding the device.\n\n286\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.500\nWe might even see where it\nsays downloading software, and\n\n287\n00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.290\nthat's it getting the driver.\n\n288\n00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.800\nIf it needs to get the driver,\nit can reach out to Apple and download it.\n\n289\n00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.950\nIt can even reach out to HP in some cases.\n\n290\n00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.140\nBut here I didn't have\nto provide a driver.\n\n291\n00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.730\nIt just had it.\n\n292\n00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.270\nIt was built into the operating system.\n\n293\n00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.800\nTha PPD was already there and\nit loaded it and\n\n294\n00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.950\nit shows the printer,\nthat's what my printer looks like,\n\n295\n00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.310\nit's a black printer that sits out\nthere on the desk, and now it shows up.\n\n296\n00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.120\nIt's idle and it's not being used.\n\n297\n00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:09.760\nThat's the completely automatic way,\nbut things aren't always automatic.\n\n298\n00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.260\nSometimes we gotta add things by hand.\n\n299\n00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.880\nSometimes the printer's not detected.\n\n300\n00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.950\nWe don't find it just automatically.\n\n301\n00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:19.170\nAnd so for those scenarios,\nyou can hit that little plus symbol, and\n\n302\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.220\nyou can choose Add Printer or Scanner.\n\n303\n00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.350\nAnd when you do that, now we can go in,\nand we can add a printer.\n\n304\n00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.680\nAnd if it's detected, that's great.\n\n305\n00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.150\nBut we might have to manually put it in,\nand so looking at it, here's the two that\n\n306\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.100\nwere automatically detected, and\nI can see how they were detected.\n\n307\n00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.900\nOne by Bonjour,\none by Bonjour Multifunction.\n\n308\n00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.250\nWell, what the heck does that mean?\n\n309\n00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.590\nWell, the printer at our editor station,\nit's just a printer.\n\n310\n00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.150\nIt's a regular old printer.\n\n311\n00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.140\nIt's black and white, doesn't do color.\n\n312\n00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.200\nThat's it.\n\n313\n00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.010\nBut Tim's his must be fancy pants.\n\n314\n00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.670\nIt's a color printer,\nI bet it has a scanner on it and\n\n315\n00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.470\nthat's why it's saying multifunction and\nat a minimum it probably has\n\n316\n00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.830\na modem on it to make it multifunction,\nso that's why it's turning up that way.\n\n317\n00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.130\nBut I can set this up and\nadd it and print to it.\n\n318\n00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.990\nBut if it's not showing up in the list\nthen I can add it by hand and\n\n319\n00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.690\nthe way we would add it by\nhand is by going to IP.\n\n320\n00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.180\nOnto the IP tab.\n\n321\n00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.110\nHere's where we can come in and\n\n322\n00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.130\nspecify how we're going to see\nthat printer on the network.\n\n323\n00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.280\nAnd when you communicate to\na printer on the network,\n\n324\n00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.130\nthere's several different protocols.\n\n325\n00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.639\nAnd so you'll see each of them right here.\n\n326\n00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:19.490\nIPP.\nIPP.\n\n327\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:20.140\nP is the default.\n\n328\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.130\nThat is the internet print protocol.\n\n329\n00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.650\nAnd what it is, is a standard\nprotocol to communicate to printers\n\n330\n00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:27.590\nanywhere in the world,\nit can work over the internet.\n\n331\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.560\nIt's a bad idea to make it\navailable on the internet, but\n\n332\n00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.270\nit can work on the internet.\n\n333\n00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.640\nThe idea with IPP is that\nit's a standard language.\n\n334\n00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.000\nSo that printer can be an HP,\nit can be Canon it can be a Brother,\n\n335\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.160\nwhatever brand printer\nit is that you have.\n\n336\n00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.020\nAnd we'll be able to talk to it.\n\n337\n00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.340\nIt's a standard language.\n\n338\n00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.970\nKinda like CUPS is a standard format for\nprinter drivers.\n\n339\n00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:52.090\nIPP is a standard format for\nthe language we talk to those printers.\n\n340\n00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.220\nAnd it makes it easy to communicate.\n\n341\n00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.550\nYou also have LPD\nthe Line Line Printer Daemon,\n\n342\n00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.470\nthat's what Unix systems used to use.\n\n343\n00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.136\nBefore CUPS came about and\nreplaced a lot of what it did,\n\n344\n00:16:01.136 --> 00:16:02.687\nLPD was the way that you sent it.\n\n345\n00:16:02.687 --> 00:16:03.872\nIt was a line printer, right.\n\n346\n00:16:03.872 --> 00:16:07.673\nThink of those dot matrix printers where\nthey would print line by line, right.\n\n347\n00:16:07.673 --> 00:16:08.729\nThat's how printers used to work.\n\n348\n00:16:08.729 --> 00:16:11.388\nAnd LPD is what provided that.\n\n349\n00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:15.240\nAnd then last, we've got HP Jetdirect,\nsocket printing, right?\n\n350\n00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.950\nThat's where HP printers had these special\ncards that were called Jetdirect cards\n\n351\n00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.501\nthat allowed to plug into the network,\nand we could send directly to that card,\n\n352\n00:16:22.501 --> 00:16:24.053\nand it would print on the printer.\n\n353\n00:16:24.053 --> 00:16:25.650\nThat worked great with HP's.\n\n354\n00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.055\nIt didn't work so\nwell with Cannon, and Brother, and\n\n355\n00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:29.950\nthe other name brands that were out there.\n\n356\n00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:34.774\nAnd that's because Lexmark isn't going to\nbuild an HP solution into their printer,\n\n357\n00:16:34.774 --> 00:16:35.970\nthey're Lexmark.\n\n358\n00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:37.410\nThey're going to do their own thing.\n\n359\n00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.020\nSo you've gotta choose what's appropriate.\n\n360\n00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.570\nThe neat one, I think, is AirPrint.\n\n361\n00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.740\nAirPrint was introduced several years ago,\nand if you have a printer\n\n362\n00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.490\nthat has a wireless connection on\nit it likely supports AirPrint.\n\n363\n00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.480\nEven if it's wired it might\nhave AirPrint support.\n\n364\n00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:55.100\nSo that you can have an iPad, or an\niPhone, or your Mac, and they can all just\n\n365\n00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.530\nfind a printer over wireless, directly\ncommunicate and print to it, and you don't\n\n366\n00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.310\nhave to worry about drivers at all\nbecause AirPrint uses a standard format.\n\n367\n00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.440\nBut it's an Apple technology.\n\n368\n00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.760\nYour Windows machines aren't gonna use\nthat, and so you might not have AirPrint\n\n369\n00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.260\nsupport because most printers\nare designed with Windows in mind.\n\n370\n00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.350\nNow If I just leave it at IPP and I choose\nwrong, it will actually try and auto\n\n371\n00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:20.080\ndetect and see if that's wrong and flip to\nanother one to find one that will work.\n\n372\n00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.130\nSo I could punch in a printer,\n\n373\n00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.810\nlet's see if I can think of\nanother printer on the network.\n\n374\n00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.280\nI wonder if I could talk to that one.\n\n375\n00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.520\nWe might be talking to that one.\n\n376\n00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.060\nThere's several printers\nhere in the office.\n\n377\n00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.790\nI guess I could do that HP\none that we added, right?\n\n378\n00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:34.520\nSo this guy?\n\n379\n00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.040\nLet me just take him out, and\nI'll add him by hand this time.\n\n380\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.820\nInstead of it being automatic,\nwe're gonna add it by hand.\n\n381\n00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.363\nSo I'll go back in here, and\nI'm gonna add a Printer.\n\n382\n00:17:42.363 --> 00:17:43.411\nAnd I'll go to IP, and\n\n383\n00:17:43.411 --> 00:17:47.520\nI'm gonna punch in the IP address of\nthat printer which is 10.1.230.231.\n\n384\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.840\nAnd down here you can see I\nwas doing a detection and\n\n385\n00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:58.070\nit did auto detect and it detected\nit as a Generic PostScript Printer.\n\n386\n00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.990\nIs that what it is?\n\n387\n00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.990\nIs it a Generic PostScript Printer?\n\n388\n00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:07.295\nWell, no, it is an HP M400DNE\nsomething like that, I don't remember.\n\n389\n00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.562\nBut [LAUGH] that's what it is,\n\n390\n00:18:08.562 --> 00:18:11.158\nwe know from a moment ago where\nit auto detected everything.\n\n391\n00:18:11.158 --> 00:18:14.604\nHere, IPP doesn't have enough\ninformation to be able to tell\n\n392\n00:18:14.604 --> 00:18:17.150\nme exactly what kind of printer that is.\n\n393\n00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.060\nAnd so\nit's picking just a generic postscript.\n\n394\n00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:20.700\nIt could do a PCL.\n\n395\n00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.630\nThere's postscript and PCL.\n\n396\n00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.020\nOr I could pick a specific\nsoftware package.\n\n397\n00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:29.080\nIf I had to install a software\npackage like that Canon UFR II driver,\n\n398\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.780\nthen I could choose that, and now we\nwould know how to talk to it, right?\n\n399\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:37.064\nBut here it just tried to auto detected\nit, and it wasn't quiet accurate,\n\n400\n00:18:37.064 --> 00:18:37.753\nall right?\n\n401\n00:18:37.753 --> 00:18:41.760\nI think Tim's printer is .230,\nlet's see if that one does any better.\n\n402\n00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.499\nAnd so we'll try that one and\nsee what we get.\n\n403\n00:18:43.499 --> 00:18:45.346\nAnd, actually, I had it wrong.\n\n404\n00:18:45.346 --> 00:18:51.221\n231 must have been Tim's printer because\n2030 picked up as HP LaserJet 400 color,\n\n405\n00:18:51.221 --> 00:18:53.286\nno, actually that one is Tim's.\n\n406\n00:18:53.286 --> 00:18:54.623\nThat's the M475.\n\n407\n00:18:54.623 --> 00:18:56.110\nI've got to get my printer straight.\n\n408\n00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.720\nSo this is Tim's location, OwnersOffice,\n\n409\n00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.180\nwhich would just be whoever\nowns the printer I guess.\n\n410\n00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.950\nSo I'm gonna call this Tim's Office.\n\n411\n00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.370\nAnd I'll give it a better name,\nI'm gonna call it Tim's Printer.\n\n412\n00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.780\nIt did actually identify what that\nprinter is, which is kinda nice.\n\n413\n00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.000\nAnd all I did was give it\nthe IP address of the printer.\n\n414\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.382\nAnd now, I can add it in,\nand it's gonna put that in.\n\n415\n00:19:17.382 --> 00:19:20.463\nAnd because it knew that\nit was an HP Laserjet 400,\n\n416\n00:19:20.463 --> 00:19:23.380\nit's Downloading Printer Software Update.\n\n417\n00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:27.260\nIt's downloading the right driver for\nthat printer, because it's color and\n\n418\n00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.120\nit's multi-function.\n\n419\n00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.801\nIt's got extra stuff on it.\n\n420\n00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:33.761\nAnd so it's grabbing that extra\nsupport and putting it in place.\n\n421\n00:19:33.761 --> 00:19:36.723\nAnd it'll grab some PPD files\nto be able to power that, or\n\n422\n00:19:36.723 --> 00:19:40.100\nreally just one PPD file,\nto be able to power and connect to it.\n\n423\n00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.090\nSo it gonna download and get that added.\n\n424\n00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.860\nNow, while we are waiting on it, let's\ntalk about the support side of things.\n\n425\n00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.600\nI keep mentioning these PPD files.\n\n426\n00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.850\nWhere do those go?\n\n427\n00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.550\nWell, a lot of them are part of the\noperating system so you can't find them,\n\n428\n00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.130\nyou can't see them.\n\n429\n00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.642\nBut some of them, oops,\nI'm gonna click randomly on things.\n\n430\n00:19:57.642 --> 00:20:00.475\nI'm trying to get in my terminal here.\n\n431\n00:20:00.475 --> 00:20:01.277\nThere we go.\n\n432\n00:20:01.277 --> 00:20:04.169\nA lot of them are hidden away so\nwe can't see them but\n\n433\n00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:08.216\nthe ones that we load actually go to\na particular place on the computer.\n\n434\n00:20:08.216 --> 00:20:12.850\nAnd if we dive in here\na bit we can find it.\n\n435\n00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:20.768\nAnd if we look in, it's /Library/Printers.\n\n436\n00:20:20.768 --> 00:20:22.220\nThat folder right there.\n\n437\n00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.990\nSo I'm in /Library/Printers, and if I take\na look in there, I've got an Epson folder.\n\n438\n00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.550\nI haven't loaded any Epson stuff, have I?\n\n439\n00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.570\nWell, apparently it put something there.\n\n440\n00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:32.730\nI've got a Canon folder.\n\n441\n00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.860\nWell, I was talking about that\nCanon printer earlier, right?\n\n442\n00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.835\nAnd maybe I've loaded\nsomething from Canon.\n\n443\n00:20:37.835 --> 00:20:42.067\nI've got icons, those are the customized\nicons for each printer so\n\n444\n00:20:42.067 --> 00:20:45.272\nthey look like the actual printer,\nand then PPDs.\n\n445\n00:20:45.272 --> 00:20:47.567\nThere's those PPDs that\nI was talking about.\n\n446\n00:20:47.567 --> 00:20:50.466\nAnd if I look in there, well,\nI just see this Contents folder,\n\n447\n00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:52.630\nwhich is not terribly exciting.\n\n448\n00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.960\nAnd so let's browse into that.\n\n449\n00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.910\nAnd we've got Resources.\n\n450\n00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.890\nSomewhere in here,\nwe'll hit the end of the rainbow.\n\n451\n00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:02.070\nAnd here's a couple of them, right.\n\n452\n00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:06.350\nSo we've got some EPSON FAX A3,\nEPSON FAX whatever.\n\n453\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.770\nAnd these are .gz, not ppd.\n\n454\n00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.460\nAnd that's because they've been gzipped,\nthey've been compressed, but\n\n455\n00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.120\ninside of them is the PPD file.\n\n456\n00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.940\nSo here's a couple of PPDs\nthat are sitting here.\n\n457\n00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:19.330\nNow, I added our editor station printer\na minute ago, where is it's PPD?\n\n458\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.620\nWell, one of two things, either one,\nit's built in to the system anyway so\n\n459\n00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.460\nit didn't actually get loaded,\nor two, I deleted the printer,\n\n460\n00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.910\nit may have deleted the PPD\nbecause I didn't need it anymore.\n\n461\n00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.010\nBut this is where they'll end up.\n\n462\n00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.550\nThe just kinda get buried\naway in /Library/Printers.\n\n463\n00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.560\nThat's where they get put.\n\n464\n00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:40.800\nNow for the built in ones,\nthere's actually /System/Library/Printers.\n\n465\n00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.630\nAnd we can change into that one so\nthat I'm in /System/Library/Printers, and\n\n466\n00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.360\nwe can browse into the same basic thing.\n\n467\n00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.400\nBut a lot of these are protected,\nyou can't mess with them,\n\n468\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.500\nit's part of the system directory.\n\n469\n00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.770\nWe have system integrity protection\nthat stops us from messing with it.\n\n470\n00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.800\nBut you'll look in here and find some\npretty interesting things sometimes.\n\n471\n00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.215\nLike this guy,\ninternet printing protocol 2 ppd.\n\n472\n00:22:01.215 --> 00:22:04.886\nSo if I have an ipp driver,\nI can use it as a ppd or vise versa so\n\n473\n00:22:04.886 --> 00:22:08.150\nthat we can kinda handle that conversion.\n\n474\n00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:10.070\nYour operating system\nhas that stuff built in.\n\n475\n00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.780\nIt's pretty slick.\n\n476\n00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.830\nIt's kinda a neat system\nwith how that works.\n\n477\n00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.590\nWe'll see how that other printer is doing.\n\n478\n00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.720\nApparently it's disappeared on me.\n\n479\n00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.800\nSo I don't see it anymore.\n\n480\n00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.150\nSo lets jump into my System Preferences\nand see if that printer got added.\n\n481\n00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:28.950\nAnd when I go in here, what I expect\nto see is yeah, there's Tim's Printer.\n\n482\n00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.680\nAnd, yep, sure enough,\nthat's what it looks like.\n\n483\n00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.870\nSo its got it added, it brought it in.\n\n484\n00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.310\nThere's that HP Laserjet 300.\n\n485\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.830\nAnd I can go ahead and add back in,\nthe the editor station if I want.\n\n486\n00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.030\nPut that one back in, and\nnow I've got these printers in place.\n\n487\n00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:44.730\nNow once the printers are in place, let's\ntalk a little bit about their operation.\n\n488\n00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:48.720\nIf they're multi-function, then they\nmight have scanners built into it, right?\n\n489\n00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.240\nAnd the scanners will show up here too.\n\n490\n00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.650\nSo Tim's Printer has a scanner ,and you'll\neven notice the tool itself is called\n\n491\n00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.000\nPrinters & Scanners.\n\n492\n00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.960\nSo, if it's not a printer,\n\n493\n00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.230\nif it's just a scanner,\nit'll still show up in the same place.\n\n494\n00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.270\nTim's printer, it looks like it\nhas a scanner built into it so\n\n495\n00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.260\nit can send faxes and things.\n\n496\n00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.090\nWhen you look at options and\nsupplies, and you click on that,\n\n497\n00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.710\nhere it tells us a little bit about\nthe printer and what it can do.\n\n498\n00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:15.091\nAnd so I see that his printer has a Duplex\nUnit so it can print on both sides,\n\n499\n00:23:15.091 --> 00:23:19.986\nand it's got a Tray 3, an extra paper tray\nattached to it that I can turn on or off.\n\n500\n00:23:19.986 --> 00:23:21.170\nIt's off right now, and\n\n501\n00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:24.350\nthat means that my Mac couldn't\nfigure out if he had Tray 3 or not.\n\n502\n00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.592\nMaybe he didn't buy that option.\n\n503\n00:23:25.592 --> 00:23:26.618\nI should go and look,\n\n504\n00:23:26.618 --> 00:23:29.910\nand if it actually has a Tray 3 on\nthe bottom, I can check this off.\n\n505\n00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.710\nAnd now, when I print I can choose Tray 3.\n\n506\n00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:35.100\nAnd maybe I got the really\nnice letterhead in Tray 3, and\n\n507\n00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:39.840\nI got regular paper in Tray 2,\nand maybe Tray 1 is envelopes.\n\n508\n00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.180\nSo you can have different\nthings in each tray, so\n\n509\n00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.260\nwe need to be able to pick from that.\n\n510\n00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.210\nYou can look at your supply levels.\n\n511\n00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.461\nHe's got a color printer so\nI can see the ink or\n\n512\n00:23:47.461 --> 00:23:49.304\ntoner level of each of his printers.\n\n513\n00:23:49.304 --> 00:23:53.530\nI don't know if his is laser, it was\na Laser Jet, so I guess it is laser.\n\n514\n00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.063\nSo these are all toner levels.\n\n515\n00:23:55.063 --> 00:23:58.743\nAnd then, if the vendor has a software\nutility for the printer I'll see it here,\n\n516\n00:23:58.743 --> 00:24:01.358\nand I can launch that and\ngo into their software utility.\n\n517\n00:24:01.358 --> 00:24:03.679\nWell, I don't know if his printer does.\n\n518\n00:24:03.679 --> 00:24:07.082\nA lot of printers don't include\na software utility anymore.\n\n519\n00:24:07.082 --> 00:24:09.502\nMost of them include a web page,\na web page that you browse to and\n\n520\n00:24:09.502 --> 00:24:10.560\nthat's how you manage it.\n\n521\n00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.750\nSo when I look at his you may or\nmay not see it.\n\n522\n00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:17.390\nLooking at the other one, the editing\nstation printer here, when I choose it\n\n523\n00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.210\nit's going to reach out to it and try to\nfind out if it has a software package.\n\n524\n00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.420\nAgain, it probably doesn't.\n\n525\n00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.412\nBut up here you'll see I've got HP\nsupport, supplies, registration,\n\n526\n00:24:25.412 --> 00:24:25.952\nrecycling.\n\n527\n00:24:25.952 --> 00:24:29.660\nThis is nice part about buying a printer\nthat's directly supported by Apple.\n\n528\n00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.380\nIf it's one that you've added and\nhad to put in your own driver or whatever,\n\n529\n00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.780\nyou're not gonna have all of this stuff\nif you don't have that tight integration.\n\n530\n00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.207\nHP and Apple had been really close for\na long time.\n\n531\n00:24:39.691 --> 00:24:43.580\nAll right, another thing to pay attention\nto is if you're having problems with your\n\n532\n00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.483\nprinter, then you wanna jump\ninto your system preferences and\n\n533\n00:24:46.483 --> 00:24:48.880\nlook right here at\nthe status of that printer.\n\n534\n00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.600\nSee how these show as idle and they've\ngot a green light on them, all right?\n\n535\n00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.550\nThe green light means, yes, the printer is\nidle, but I can talk to it, I can see it.\n\n536\n00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.271\nIf that becomes yellow that means\nthere's a problem on the printer.\n\n537\n00:25:01.271 --> 00:25:03.489\nMaybe it's got a printer jam,\nmaybe it's out of paper.\n\n538\n00:25:03.489 --> 00:25:05.863\nAnd it'll usually say that,\nlike, hey, I'm out of paper.\n\n539\n00:25:05.863 --> 00:25:09.610\nAnd so now iI know and I can go over\nto the printer and add some more paper.\n\n540\n00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:13.430\nSo, communication problems will\nshow up here really quickly.\n\n541\n00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.330\nWe'll spot that and\nsee that we've got that issue.\n\n542\n00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.399\nThe place you can notice\nit is in print queue.\n\n543\n00:25:18.399 --> 00:25:21.320\nIf you choose a printer and\nhit Open Print Queue,\n\n544\n00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.520\nyou'll see any jobs that are pending\nto go out to that printer.\n\n545\n00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:30.050\nSo, if I fire up text edit, for\nexample, and I make a document.\n\n546\n00:25:31.915 --> 00:25:37.195\nSo this is a test document, and\nlet me make that nice and big.\n\n547\n00:25:37.195 --> 00:25:41.025\nWe'll make people wonder what I'm doing\nout there at the editing station.\n\n548\n00:25:41.025 --> 00:25:42.022\nAnd I go to print this out, right?\n\n549\n00:25:42.022 --> 00:25:45.269\nSo when I go to print this document,\nI'm gonna print it and\n\n550\n00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:47.570\nI'm gonna chose that HP Laser Jet.\n\n551\n00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:48.450\nWatch back here.\n\n552\n00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.188\nSo in the background,\nthis is the printer queue.\n\n553\n00:25:51.188 --> 00:25:54.012\nAnd in the foreground,\nI'm gonna tell this document to print.\n\n554\n00:25:54.012 --> 00:25:58.350\nSee how it shows an untitled\ndocument because I didn't save?\n\n555\n00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.090\nAnd so it's printing.\n\n556\n00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.940\nIt's connected to the printer.\n\n557\n00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.200\nIf it can't connect it'll\nget stuck right there.\n\n558\n00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.280\nNow it's waiting for the job to complete.\n\n559\n00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.280\nI sent the print job to the printer,\n\n560\n00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.780\nthe printer will now tell\nme if it's successful.\n\n561\n00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.870\nIf it's successful, the job disappears.\n\n562\n00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:16.539\nIf it fails, it'll tell me the error\nright here and it'll let me retry.\n\n563\n00:26:16.539 --> 00:26:18.617\nYou can click on it and retry.\n\n564\n00:26:18.617 --> 00:26:20.250\nLet me pause the printer.\n\n565\n00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:25.396\nif I pause the printer, now when I send\nprint jobs to it, I can send a job and\n\n566\n00:26:25.396 --> 00:26:29.386\nnow it's gonna go and\nit's gonna go, and it's paused.\n\n567\n00:26:29.386 --> 00:26:31.461\nSee how it's warning me here,\ndo you really wanna do this,\n\n568\n00:26:31.461 --> 00:26:32.552\ndo you wanna resume printing?\n\n569\n00:26:32.552 --> 00:26:34.090\nCuz it is paused right now.\n\n570\n00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.830\nI'll go ahead and just say,\nadd to the printer.\n\n571\n00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:39.760\nNow, that job is gonna sit here and\nsay, Ready to Print.\n\n572\n00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.200\nIf I know there's a paper jam I might\npause the printer so that I can go and\n\n573\n00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:49.110\nclear the jam, and jobs will just build up\nright here until the printer is back and\n\n574\n00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.150\nactive, and then they'll go.\n\n575\n00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.600\nWhat they're doing is, right here, they're\nwaiting in what's called your queue.\n\n576\n00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.150\nThe print queue, it 's a place on your\nhard drive where the print jobs are stored\n\n577\n00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.722\nuntil the printer successfully prints.\n\n578\n00:26:58.722 --> 00:27:03.034\nThat way I can close TextEdit, and\nI never saved this document, right?\n\n579\n00:27:03.034 --> 00:27:05.530\nBut I can close TextEdit,\nI can tell it not to save.\n\n580\n00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.597\nThat document is now gone,\nit doesn't exist anymore.\n\n581\n00:27:07.597 --> 00:27:08.736\nI quit out of TextEdit.\n\n582\n00:27:08.736 --> 00:27:13.070\nBut the print job is still there\ncuz it's saved in that queue.\n\n583\n00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.010\nNow the queues on your hard drive, and\non the exam they might hit you on this, so\n\n584\n00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.890\nlet me bring it up real quick.\n\n585\n00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:23.080\nThe queue is stashed\naway on your hard drive\n\n586\n00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:28.132\ninside of, let's see, /var/spool.\n\n587\n00:27:28.132 --> 00:27:30.024\nSo in the Unix subsystem,\n\n588\n00:27:30.024 --> 00:27:34.990\n/var/spool is a special directory\nwhere temporary stuff goes.\n\n589\n00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:37.432\nAnd it's normally things\nlike your log files, right?\n\n590\n00:27:37.432 --> 00:27:41.900\nWell, log files can go in /var/log too,\nbut spool is any kind of temporary data.\n\n591\n00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.370\nAnd a print job is temporary data.\n\n592\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.755\nAnd so /var/spool is where\nwe'll see a lot of his stuff.\n\n593\n00:27:47.755 --> 00:27:51.510\nYou'll see fax, mqueue,\npostfix, which is email.\n\n594\n00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.000\nThese are all things that\ncan use that spool folder.\n\n595\n00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.400\nBut cups is the one that I'm thinking of.\n\n596\n00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.870\nThat's the print subsystem.\n\n597\n00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:01.370\nSo when I go to print,\nthose jobs are going into this folder.\n\n598\n00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.550\nBut what would happens if I try and\nget into it.\n\n599\n00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:04.880\nPermission denied.\n\n600\n00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.090\nWhy is that?\n\n601\n00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:10.870\nWell, if I can get into it,\nI can see everybody's print jobs.\n\n602\n00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.920\nSo somebody else could be\nprinting something sensitive and\n\n603\n00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.210\nnow I can just watch the print queue and\ngrab those documents and read them.\n\n604\n00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.180\nSo, you have to be\nan administrator to get in there.\n\n605\n00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.879\nSo if I do a sudo ls of that directly,\nright?\n\n606\n00:28:21.879 --> 00:28:27.536\nWhich is /var/spool/cups, If I do\na sudo to run that as an administrator,\n\n607\n00:28:27.536 --> 00:28:31.545\nI can provide my password and\nnow I can see inside of it.\n\n608\n00:28:31.545 --> 00:28:33.008\nAnd what do I see?\n\n609\n00:28:33.008 --> 00:28:37.211\nWell, these little numbers, and\neach number is identifying a printer.\n\n610\n00:28:37.211 --> 00:28:39.405\nAnd inside of a printer is\nthe print job that's tied to it.\n\n611\n00:28:39.405 --> 00:28:43.745\nWe have one big spool, one big queue, for\nall of the various printers that I've got.\n\n612\n00:28:43.745 --> 00:28:47.813\nAnd so if you poke around inside of it,\nyou can find all sorts of neat stuff.\n\n613\n00:28:47.813 --> 00:28:50.102\nYou're not supposed to\npoke around inside of it,\n\n614\n00:28:50.102 --> 00:28:53.437\nI guess would be the more important\nlesson I should be teaching you guys.\n\n615\n00:28:53.437 --> 00:28:56.794\nBut if we start poking around inside\nof it, well, that one's empty.\n\n616\n00:28:56.794 --> 00:28:58.163\nThat one's empty.\n\n617\n00:28:58.163 --> 00:29:00.068\nThat one's empty.\n\n618\n00:29:00.068 --> 00:29:02.194\nActually, those aren't\ndirectories are they?\n\n619\n00:29:02.194 --> 00:29:03.839\nLet me do a ls-la.\n\n620\n00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.790\nSure enough, those are files.\n\n621\n00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.007\nSo, these don't have the d tag on them.\n\n622\n00:29:10.007 --> 00:29:10.622\nSo they're not directories.\n\n623\n00:29:10.622 --> 00:29:12.562\nThese are more than likely print jobs.\n\n624\n00:29:12.562 --> 00:29:13.201\nHere's a nice big one.\n\n625\n00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:14.987\nThat one's definitely\na print job right here.\n\n626\n00:29:14.987 --> 00:29:19.767\nSo this one that's labelled d00003-001,\nthat's likely the print job\n\n627\n00:29:19.767 --> 00:29:25.010\nthat I sent a moment ago that's sitting\nthere stuck in the queue right now.\n\n628\n00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:30.570\nAnd if I jump over to my queue and resume\nthat printer, that job is gonna print.\n\n629\n00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:31.450\nAnd once it prints,\n\n630\n00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:36.080\nit's gonna leave the system as soon as\nthe printer tells me that it's done.\n\n631\n00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.810\nSo it's gonna leave and go away.\n\n632\n00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:40.300\nAnd once it's gone this file\n\n633\n00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:44.380\nwill go away because I don't need it in my\nqueue anymore, I've successfully printed.\n\n634\n00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.720\nAnd so if I pull that directory\nback up again, sure enough,\n\n635\n00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.510\nthat d0003-001 is gone now.\n\n636\n00:29:51.905 --> 00:29:53.605\nIt printed, and that's it.\n\n637\n00:29:53.605 --> 00:29:58.565\nSo, these guys up here, the c00001, 2 and\n3, those mostly identify my printers.\n\n638\n00:29:58.565 --> 00:29:59.937\nCuz remember, I added one and deleted it.\n\n639\n00:29:59.937 --> 00:30:01.412\nAnd then I added two more,\nso that would make sense.\n\n640\n00:30:01.412 --> 00:30:02.457\nThere's my three printers.\n\n641\n00:30:02.457 --> 00:30:06.315\nBut these d's, that was my print job,\nand now it's gone.\n\n642\n00:30:06.315 --> 00:30:10.995\nSo that queue is stored right there on\nyour hard drive, and that's why you can\n\n643\n00:30:10.995 --> 00:30:15.539\nclose a program or delete a document and\nthe print job can still go through.\n\n644\n00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:19.138\nAll right, so the only other thing I\nreally need to hit on on printers,\n\n645\n00:30:19.138 --> 00:30:23.400\nthe only other thing that can turn up on\nthe exam, really, is printer sharing.\n\n646\n00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.310\nAnd we've kinda already talked\nabout it a little bit, but\n\n647\n00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:27.220\nlet's just rehash that real quick.\n\n648\n00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.170\nWhen I add a printer to my computer,\nI can turn around and\n\n649\n00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:31.140\nshare it with other people.\n\n650\n00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.560\nAnd you normally only do that\nwith direct attached printers.\n\n651\n00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.930\nSo if I have a USB attached printer,\nI'm the only one who can see it.\n\n652\n00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:39.958\nSo I can then share of the network for\neverybody else so they can see it, right?\n\n653\n00:30:39.958 --> 00:30:43.892\nBut with a network printer like these\nthat I've been using in this show, well,\n\n654\n00:30:43.892 --> 00:30:46.680\nI think everybody can see that it's on the\nnetwork, so they can just connect direct.\n\n655\n00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.050\nThey don't have to go through me, right?\n\n656\n00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.980\nWell, maybe you wanna\nset up a print server.\n\n657\n00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.580\nYou might want to have a centralize place\nwhere people print so its all goes to\n\n658\n00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.960\none server instead of everybody\nconnecting directly to the printers.\n\n659\n00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.570\nNow, why would we wanna do that?\n\n660\n00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:05.520\nThere's a few reasons,\nthe main reason is centralized management.\n\n661\n00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.700\nThat if I wanna pause a printer and\n\n662\n00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.555\nmake sure nobody's printing to it,\nif everybody prints direct,\n\n663\n00:31:11.555 --> 00:31:14.514\nI'd to go to everybody's computer and\npause their print queue, right?\n\n664\n00:31:14.514 --> 00:31:18.626\nOr I'd have to call everybody on the phone\nand say, hey, don't print to that printer.\n\n665\n00:31:18.626 --> 00:31:22.727\nBut if everybody goes through one central\nserver, I could pause the printer on\n\n666\n00:31:22.727 --> 00:31:26.340\nthat central server and\neverybody's print jobs would queue up.\n\n667\n00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.880\nThey'd just start building up in the queue\non that server until I resumed it.\n\n668\n00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.147\nSo it would give me control.\n\n669\n00:31:31.147 --> 00:31:32.410\nIt would give me monitoring.\n\n670\n00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.980\nI can control who was\ngoing to that printer.\n\n671\n00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.610\nThat's the main reason for\nhaving centralized printing.\n\n672\n00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:38.860\nThere are other reasons.\n\n673\n00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:42.050\nMaybe for auditing purposes,\nyou need to keep a record of that.\n\n674\n00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.931\nThink about all the big data leaks\nthat had happened for companies.\n\n675\n00:31:44.931 --> 00:31:48.951\nA lot of companies spend a ton\nof money putting firewalls and\n\n676\n00:31:48.951 --> 00:31:52.571\nVPNs in place and\nmaking sure that their customers and\n\n677\n00:31:52.571 --> 00:31:56.208\ntheir employees don't leak\ndata out of the company.\n\n678\n00:31:56.208 --> 00:32:01.022\nBut, once I print something on a piece\nof paper, I could leave it in a cab.\n\n679\n00:32:01.022 --> 00:32:02.288\nI could leave it at a bus station.\n\n680\n00:32:02.288 --> 00:32:06.020\nI could sell it to a foreign government.\n\n681\n00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:06.650\nYou could do whatever.\n\n682\n00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:09.660\nOnce it's on paper, it's kind of\noutside of that monitoring system.\n\n683\n00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.870\nAnd so you might want to be auditing\neverything that gets printed.\n\n684\n00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.560\nWell, if you've got a centralized server,\nyou can record those cues.\n\n685\n00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.290\nYou can keep track of all\nthe print jobs that go through it.\n\n686\n00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:22.790\nWho did the print job,\nwhat they printed, and you can see it.\n\n687\n00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:24.430\nYou get a historical record.\n\n688\n00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.100\nIf you're centrally managing it.\n\n689\n00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.600\nIf people are printing to the printers\ndirectly, you'd have to go to each\n\n690\n00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.050\nprinter and configure that\ntype of recording on each one.\n\n691\n00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.590\nAnd it's not the easiest thing to do.\n\n692\n00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:34.200\nSome printers don't even support it.\n\n693\n00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.140\nSo having it centralized can help.\n\n694\n00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.430\nSo on those scenarios,\nwe'll want to share that printer out.\n\n695\n00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:39.480\nAnd sharing is really easy.\n\n696\n00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.409\nIf we go back in our system preferences,\n\n697\n00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.490\nyou can do it right here\nfrom inside of printing.\n\n698\n00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.130\nI showed you in the sharing episode,\nright?.\n\n699\n00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.340\nWe went into\nthe Sharing System Preference.\n\n700\n00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.880\nAnd you can turn on printer sharing.\n\n701\n00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.310\nAnd when you turn it on,\nyou can pick your printers and\n\n702\n00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.280\npick your preferences, right?.\n\n703\n00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.910\nSo that's one way to do it.\n\n704\n00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.850\nThe other way to do it is from\nthe Printer System Preference.\n\n705\n00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:03.080\nSo if I go in here and I find my printer,\nyou actually have the option right here.\n\n706\n00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.260\nDo I want to share it on the network and\nwhat are my preferences?\n\n707\n00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.640\nIf I choose to share it,\n\n708\n00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.800\nit's now being shared on the network\nwith it's default settings.\n\n709\n00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.820\nAnd then I can go to\nSharing Preferences and\n\n710\n00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.820\nit just takes me right over to the sharing\nscreen and I can pick my printer.\n\n711\n00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.450\nNow, I didn't hit Apply so\nit didn't actually check it so\n\n712\n00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:21.940\nI'll have to turn it on here again.\n\n713\n00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.150\nAnd now I can set my permissions.\n\n714\n00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:26.790\nThe default is that everybody\nis allowed to print.\n\n715\n00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.180\nEverybody can't see each other's\nprint jobs but everybody can print.\n\n716\n00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.240\nI can change that and I can add other\npeople with access so I might add, for\n\n717\n00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.610\nexample, me.\n\n718\n00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:39.310\nSo I'm gonna add me to the list, right?.\n\n719\n00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:42.060\nAnd when I do that, notice what happens.\n\n720\n00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.700\nWell,actually, two things happen.\n\n721\n00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.030\nOne, everyone's switched to no access and\ntwo, I didn't show up.\n\n722\n00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.870\nWell, there's a little\nquirk in El Capitan.\n\n723\n00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:51.840\nI'm sure they're gonna fix this with\nan update, but I'm in the list.\n\n724\n00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.490\nI'm just not showing up,\nfor whatever reason, and\n\n725\n00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.450\nI think I showed this to you\nin an episode the other day.\n\n726\n00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.100\nSo, all you do is close out of\nSystem Preferences and go back in,\n\n727\n00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.470\nand then that'll show up.\n\n728\n00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.240\nIt's kind of an annoying\nquirk of the sharing screen.\n\n729\n00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.090\nAnd so, sure enough, there I am.\n\n730\n00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:06.620\nAnd so, I can choose me.\n\n731\n00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.610\nNotice I don't have permissions over here.\n\n732\n00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:11.080\nAnd cuz it is really only one\npermission to allow me to print.\n\n733\n00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.900\nSo, I'm allowed to print that's\nwhy I don't have a choice and\n\n734\n00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:15.740\neveryone now get no access.\n\n735\n00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.330\nCuz I mean everyone, so\nif everyone had access to print all ready,\n\n736\n00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:20.910\nthen why add me specifically?\n\n737\n00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:26.090\nSo it assumes that if I added me, that I\nmust be wanting to exclude everybody else.\n\n738\n00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.930\nAnd I can add more people in here as I\nwant and those people will be able to\n\n739\n00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:30.910\nprint and everybody else will\nnot be allowed to print.\n\n740\n00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:32.660\nWe can tweak those permissions.\n\n741\n00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.300\nAside from that,\nthere's not really much to change here.\n\n742\n00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.350\nAnd you've only got this other button\nthat just takes you right back to\n\n743\n00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:39.870\nthe printing screens,\nand that's it, right?\n\n744\n00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:41.720\nSupporting printers is pretty easy.\n\n745\n00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:45.110\nReally what it comes down to is\ngetting the right driver loaded, and\n\n746\n00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:46.730\nsharing it on the network\nif that's what you desire.\n\n747\n00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:48.499\nSo otherwise,\nthey're pretty straightforward.\n\n748\n00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.250\nAll right, well, I know printers\nare not the most exciting topic, and\n\n749\n00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.460\nsomehow I just managed to\nspend 30 minutes on it.\n\n750\n00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.640\nBut we'll wrap it up here.\n\n751\n00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.710\nThat's all we've got for\nprinters, I promise.\n\n752\n00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:01.810\nBut in this episode,\nwe got a chance to see printer drivers and\n\n753\n00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.700\nwhat they are, how they get installed,\nthe PPD and the CUPS system.\n\n754\n00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.720\nWe got a chance to see all of that.\n\n755\n00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.240\nAnd we saw adding a printer\ninto Mac OS and sharing it out,\n\n756\n00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.740\nmaking available on the network.\n\n757\n00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:15.190\nAnd just some like basic troubleshooting\nof pausing and resuming a printer,\n\n758\n00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:18.320\nlooking at that status light to see\nhow that printer is functioning, and\n\n759\n00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.760\nmaking sure we've got that communications.\n\n760\n00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.630\nSo that's basically for printers.\n\n761\n00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:22.870\nNot the most exciting thing in the world.\n\n762\n00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.530\nBut something that you'll have to deal\nwith in the business world because\n\n763\n00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:29.360\nprinters are still really,\nreally common In the business world.\n\n764\n00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.440\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed that episode.\n\n765\n00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.510\nSigning off for ITPro.TV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n766\n00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:35.990\nHope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n767\n00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:37.152\nAnd hope to see you next time.\n\n768\n00:35:37.152 --> 00:35:45.581\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.819\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:19.047\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:19.047 --> 00:00:22.334\nback again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n6\n00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:25.790\nAnd I'm actually pretty excited about\nthis one cuz we're gonna jump into\n\n7\n00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.080\nsystem trouble shooting.\n\n8\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.857\nAnd you'll find that Apple has given\nus a ton of different tools for\n\n9\n00:00:29.857 --> 00:00:33.010\ntrouble shooting our system and\nmaking sure that it runs smooth.\n\n10\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.770\nWe've talked about trouble shooting\na little bit throughout the whole show.\n\n11\n00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.270\nTrouble shooting shared folders or\ntrouble shooting printers or whatever.\n\n12\n00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.710\nBut we're gonna talk about troubleshooting\nthe entire operating system here.\n\n13\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.820\nWhen you can't even boot and\nget into Mac OS, what do you do?\n\n14\n00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.780\nHow's that process work?\n\n15\n00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.130\nSo we need to understand all the tools\nthat are available to us and\n\n16\n00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.700\nhow to use them.\n\n17\n00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.830\nA key piece of information you need when\nit comes to troubleshooting the system is,\n\n18\n00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.590\nhow the system boots up?\n\n19\n00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.150\nWhat happens when I power on that computer\nand we go through the boot process?\n\n20\n00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.473\nBecause when we boot up, for the most\npart everything's behind the scenes,\n\n21\n00:01:07.473 --> 00:01:09.013\nwe don't really see much.\n\n22\n00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:12.660\nThink about the boot process\nthat you see as an end user.\n\n23\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.060\nYou push the power button on the Mac.\n\n24\n00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.110\nAnd a little Apple logo appears, and\n\n25\n00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.940\na little bar scrolls across\nthe bottom of the screen.\n\n26\n00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.581\nAnd when that bar gets all the way to\nthe sign then you get to a login Window.\n\n27\n00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:25.881\nAnd you punch in your password and\nthen you see your desktop and\n\n28\n00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:29.230\nyou work all right, so\nsounds pretty simple.\n\n29\n00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.800\nApple logo, login screen,\ndesktop, three steps.\n\n30\n00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.370\nBut in reality there's a lot of\nstuff going on behind the scenes.\n\n31\n00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.366\nThen it's actually more like a six step\nprocess, we just don't see it all.\n\n32\n00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:44.154\nIt's hidden from us what's going\non when that system boots up.\n\n33\n00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:45.900\nIt doesn't have to be hidden from us.\n\n34\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.970\nWe can actually make it show some\nof the things that are going on.\n\n35\n00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.744\nAnd then so that some of the neat\nstuff that happen behind the scenes.\n\n36\n00:01:52.744 --> 00:01:55.974\nAnd once you know about it, you just\nignore it and you enjoy how easily\n\n37\n00:01:55.974 --> 00:01:59.890\nthe operating system works with little to\nno interference or maintenance needed.\n\n38\n00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.154\nBut when something goes wrong,\nyou've gotta troubleshoot.\n\n39\n00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:06.527\nYou've gotta figure out\nwhere that something is,\n\n40\n00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:07.970\nwhere did this thing go wrong?\n\n41\n00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.790\nI just turned the computer on and\nnow I can't get into my applications, so\n\n42\n00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.679\nwhere did the problem happen?\n\n43\n00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.290\nAnd a problem can happen\nanywhere along the line.\n\n44\n00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.990\nAnd so on the exam,\nthey expect you to know\n\n45\n00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.950\nall the steps that happen between\nyou hitting the power button.\n\n46\n00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.010\nAnd you getting to your application and\nusing your computer.\n\n47\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.990\nBecause any one of those\ncould be a problem and\n\n48\n00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.590\nidentifying the step will identify how\nto solve it, how to fix that problem.\n\n49\n00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.780\nSo let's walk through the process.\n\n50\n00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.560\nIf you've got a Mac that's turned off and\nyou push that power button\n\n51\n00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.050\nthe very first thing that happens\nis your firmware is fired up.\n\n52\n00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.830\nNow, what is firmware?\n\n53\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.670\nIf we were on any other computer from any\nother vendor, we would call this our BIOS.\n\n54\n00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.690\nThe basic input/output system or\nbasic input/output operating system.\n\n55\n00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.800\nAnd the BIOS is part of your hardware and\nit does things like powering up your CPU\n\n56\n00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.530\nand powering up your video card, testing\nyour fans, doing a power on self test.\n\n57\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.850\nA basic hardware test just to make\nsure that your system functions\n\n58\n00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.600\nbefore going and\nfinding the operating system.\n\n59\n00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.490\nThis is not your operating system,\nthis is not Mac OS or OS X.\n\n60\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.520\nThe firmware is its own\nproprietary little system, very,\n\n61\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.990\nvery small built right into\nthe motherboard in your system.\n\n62\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.500\nAnd whereas other vendors\nlet you see this,\n\n63\n00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.510\nlet you actually see the subsystem,\nApple doesn't let you do that.\n\n64\n00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.780\nThe firmware on an Apple device\nis completely hidden and\n\n65\n00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.970\nobstructed away from you, so\nyou can't see and interact with it.\n\n66\n00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.900\nWell you can interact with it just a hair,\nif things go wrong.\n\n67\n00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.590\nIf things are working right,\nit's completely hidden, you never see it.\n\n68\n00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.557\nThere's no press F1 to enter BIOS or\n\n69\n00:03:46.557 --> 00:03:49.800\npress Delete to configure system\nsettings when you boot up.\n\n70\n00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.460\nYou don't see any of that, you just\nsee an Apple logo, and off you go.\n\n71\n00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.930\nSo if I've got a problem\nwith my system and\n\n72\n00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.490\nit's hardware, if the processor is bad,\nif the memory is bad, when I go and\n\n73\n00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.800\npush that power button usually\nthings go south really fast.\n\n74\n00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.930\nThings break really early on,\nyou push the power button and\n\n75\n00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.550\nyou never see the Apple logo.\n\n76\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.510\nIt just sits there, and\nyou got a black screen,\n\n77\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.186\nmaybe the monitor never even powers on.\n\n78\n00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:14.209\nYour monitor goes into sleep mode,\nand never even wakes up, so\n\n79\n00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.280\nyou got a little amber light\nthere on your monitor.\n\n80\n00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.190\nThe video card never gets powered on.\n\n81\n00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.918\nThat used to happen a lot where\npeople would get these Mac minis and\n\n82\n00:04:20.918 --> 00:04:23.706\nthey'd say it's so small,\nI can move it around all the time.\n\n83\n00:04:23.706 --> 00:04:26.750\nAnd they would move it around, and\nthey'd knock the memory loose.\n\n84\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.910\nAnd the memory chips inside would\nstart to get a little loose.\n\n85\n00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.410\nAnd now, when you got to power\non it wouldn't see RAM, and\n\n86\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.350\nyou wouldn't be able to power on.\n\n87\n00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.421\nSo what all is going on behind\nthe scenes when that occurs?\n\n88\n00:04:38.421 --> 00:04:41.255\nWell a newer Mac you don't have to worry\nabout cuz Apple doesn't let us add\n\n89\n00:04:41.255 --> 00:04:41.950\nmemory anymore.\n\n90\n00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.110\nThey sautered it in and\nyou can't change it, but\n\n91\n00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.760\nit is still something that happens.\n\n92\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.370\nSo when you power on your\nMac that firmware kicks on.\n\n93\n00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.080\nNow it's normal called the firmware, but\n\n94\n00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.300\non the exam you might also\nsee called the boot ram.\n\n95\n00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.296\nIt's fired up a boot and\nit's read only memory so it's a boot RAM,\n\n96\n00:05:00.296 --> 00:05:01.683\nwe can't interact with it.\n\n97\n00:05:01.683 --> 00:05:03.195\nIt boots up and it does it thing.\n\n98\n00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:06.050\nIt fires up a power on self test, a post.\n\n99\n00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.400\nIt does a quick check and\nthen in an ideal world\n\n100\n00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.480\nwhen the hardware is safe it\nthen turns control over to EFI.\n\n101\n00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.723\nEFI is the Extensible Firmware Interface,\nand\n\n102\n00:05:18.723 --> 00:05:21.811\nwhat EFI is is basically\nwhat is the new BIOS.\n\n103\n00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:25.560\nInstead of storing it in a chip, it\nstores it on one of your hard drives and\n\n104\n00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.210\nthen it can find the booter.\n\n105\n00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.300\nThe booter is the next step,\n\n106\n00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.220\nthat's where we actually get to\nfiring up our operating system.\n\n107\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.890\nAnd if we can't fire up our\noperating system, things break.\n\n108\n00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.300\nBut our hardware check is what\nhappens inside of the firmware world.\n\n109\n00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.340\nNow for most of us, we buy a Mac.\n\n110\n00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.060\nThe firmware's already on it,\nwe never have to mess with it.\n\n111\n00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.690\nBut Apple does release updates to firmware\nthat you may need to go and update it.\n\n112\n00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.473\nAnd if you go way back to some of the\nfirst episodes we filmed where we talked\n\n113\n00:05:51.473 --> 00:05:53.131\nabout upgrading to El Capitan.\n\n114\n00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:55.997\nOne of the recommended steps they\nhad was to update your firmware and\n\n115\n00:05:55.997 --> 00:05:57.110\nyou might need to do that.\n\n116\n00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.882\nNow in that episode, I looked at my laptop\nand there were no firmware updates for\n\n117\n00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:01.460\nmy laptop.\n\n118\n00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.690\nSo your system may be\ncompletely up to date.\n\n119\n00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.911\nApple doesn't push firmware updates\nvery often because it's firmware,\n\n120\n00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:09.194\nit's so underlying.\n\n121\n00:06:09.194 --> 00:06:11.384\nIs your hardware gonna change?\n\n122\n00:06:11.384 --> 00:06:13.120\nNo, you might add external peripherals.\n\n123\n00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.627\nBut your internal hardware,\nyou're not gonna change your processor,\n\n124\n00:06:15.627 --> 00:06:16.800\nit's not gonna happen.\n\n125\n00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.559\nAnd so it really doesn't\ncome into play very much.\n\n126\n00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:21.350\nAnd so they don't release\na lot of firmware updates.\n\n127\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.762\nBack in the day when you could\nput in your own memory, and\n\n128\n00:06:24.762 --> 00:06:26.877\nswap parts out inside of your Mac.\n\n129\n00:06:26.877 --> 00:06:30.000\nIt used to be a bigger deal and they did\nput on firmware updates pretty frequently.\n\n130\n00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.970\nSo if you have an older machine,\nyou might have that.\n\n131\n00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.635\nBut on newer Macs, almost everything\nis soldered directly in there,\n\n132\n00:06:35.635 --> 00:06:37.257\nyou can't change the pieces.\n\n133\n00:06:37.257 --> 00:06:39.386\nSo Apple knows exactly what\nhardware you have, and so\n\n134\n00:06:39.386 --> 00:06:41.055\nthey don't have to worry about updates.\n\n135\n00:06:41.055 --> 00:06:43.855\nCuz everything's already tested and\nworking out of the factory, so\n\n136\n00:06:43.855 --> 00:06:46.250\nwe don't necessarily see that very much.\n\n137\n00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.616\nBut if things are broken,\nwhen you push that power button and\n\n138\n00:06:49.616 --> 00:06:52.331\nthe firmware kicks in and\nsomething's broken.\n\n139\n00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:55.690\nIt's really hard to troubleshoot\nit because nothing happens.\n\n140\n00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.310\nYou might not see anything up on your\nscreen, you don't get any error messages.\n\n141\n00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.700\nIf the memory is knocked loose,\n\n142\n00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.130\nyour video card is gonna screw up cuz\nit uses shared memory in most cases.\n\n143\n00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.830\nAnd you're not gonna be able\nto see anything on the screen.\n\n144\n00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.640\nSo how do we troubleshoot that?\n\n145\n00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.260\nWell it kinda depends\non what the problem is.\n\n146\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.200\nIf it's a problem with your power supply,\nwhen you push the power button,\n\n147\n00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.208\nabsolutely nothing's gonna happen,\nno lights anywhere.\n\n148\n00:07:19.208 --> 00:07:21.130\nEvery Mac, 100% of them,\n\n149\n00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:26.380\nall Macs have some kind of light on them\nthat indicates when they're powered on.\n\n150\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.610\nEven on a laptop where it's not obvious,\nit's the backlit keyboards these days,\n\n151\n00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.280\nwhen you turn on the backlit keyboard\nwill light up to let you know that it is\n\n152\n00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.570\nturned on.\n\n153\n00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:38.210\nOn an iMac like this one, we won't be able\nto see it on camera cuz it's pretty dim.\n\n154\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.290\nBut right here by the infrared since\nit is actually little white light,\n\n155\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.460\nit's lit right now I can see it.\n\n156\n00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.620\nThat's how I know this is on,\notherwise if I look this box,\n\n157\n00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.820\nI have no clue if it's on or off.\n\n158\n00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.720\nIf it has solid state drives inside of it,\nit will run completely silent.\n\n159\n00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.789\nYou won't feel a fan,\nyou won't hear a hard drive spinning,\n\n160\n00:07:55.789 --> 00:07:57.098\nyou won't see anything.\n\n161\n00:07:57.098 --> 00:08:00.453\nThat one little light is the only\nway I actually know the unit is on.\n\n162\n00:08:00.453 --> 00:08:03.863\nIf it's got a spinning disk,\nyou'll actually feel the inertial pull.\n\n163\n00:08:03.863 --> 00:08:04.783\nSo this one has a spinning disk.\n\n164\n00:08:04.783 --> 00:08:07.680\nI can actually feel it resisting\nas I tilt the unit like this.\n\n165\n00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.820\nSo I know what's on there too.\n\n166\n00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.850\nI know the hard drive is spinning\nbecause I can feel that resistance.\n\n167\n00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.200\nYou may also feel a fan, but\n\n168\n00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.578\non a Mac Mini it's tough cuz the fan is\nactually, let me see if I can even see it.\n\n169\n00:08:18.578 --> 00:08:21.680\nIt's wedged in the corner of\nthe disc underneath it, and\n\n170\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.870\nso, it's hard to feel that fan and\nknow that it's on.\n\n171\n00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.360\nAnd if the system is cool,\nthe fan might not even be running.\n\n172\n00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.090\nMy system's not doing anything,\nso it's pretty cool right now.\n\n173\n00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.570\nSo, that light is our first indicator.\n\n174\n00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.340\nIf you push the power button and\nabsolutely nothing lights up.\n\n175\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.930\nNo status light,\nno backlit keyboard lights up or\n\n176\n00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.330\nwhatever, then you've likely\ngot a power supply issue.\n\n177\n00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.720\nOn an iMac or\n\n178\n00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.092\na Mac mini that usually means you're\ngonna make a trip to the Apple Store.\n\n179\n00:08:48.092 --> 00:08:49.950\nYou gotta go in there and get it repaired.\n\n180\n00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.556\nThey can do it under warranty.\n\n181\n00:08:51.556 --> 00:08:54.229\nYou're not really supposed to service\nthe internal parts yourself so\n\n182\n00:08:54.229 --> 00:08:55.270\nit's not an option.\n\n183\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.600\nOne the exam it's not an option,\nin real life you can go on eBay and\n\n184\n00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.890\nfind parts left and right.\n\n185\n00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.390\nBut on the exam, not an option.\n\n186\n00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.285\nIf it's a laptop,\nwell laptops have external power supplies.\n\n187\n00:09:04.285 --> 00:09:07.595\nAnd so if your laptop's not powered on,\nyou could try somebody else's power supply\n\n188\n00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:10.085\nand see, just throw a different\none on there and see if it works.\n\n189\n00:09:10.085 --> 00:09:11.405\nTry a different outlet on the wall,\n\n190\n00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:13.455\nthose are all different things\nthat we might wanna check.\n\n191\n00:09:13.455 --> 00:09:15.755\nBut if your system is showing\nnothing on the monitor,\n\n192\n00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:19.085\nno activity whatsoever,\nit's almost always power supply.\n\n193\n00:09:19.085 --> 00:09:19.995\nThat's usually an indicator.\n\n194\n00:09:19.995 --> 00:09:24.730\nIf it was anything else, like,\nif the memory was knocked loose.\n\n195\n00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.330\nThe firmware, actually, works.\n\n196\n00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.110\nIt gets power.\n\n197\n00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:31.130\nThe firmware turns on, and\nthe power-on self-test fires up, and\n\n198\n00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:35.480\nwhat's gonna happen is, when it sees that\nbad memory, it's gonna emit some beeps.\n\n199\n00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.160\nThese little beeps that\nthe computer emits.\n\n200\n00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.480\nEvery Mac has an internal\nspeaker of some sort.\n\n201\n00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.690\nEven the Mac Minis have\na little internal speaker.\n\n202\n00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.286\nAnd so, you'll hear [SOUND] or\nsomething like that.\n\n203\n00:09:45.286 --> 00:09:48.920\nAnd that beep, that was a long beep and\ntwo short beeps.\n\n204\n00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.860\nWell, the Apple repair techs have\na little guide that says, long beep and\n\n205\n00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:53.760\ntwo short beeps?\n\n206\n00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.120\nThat's loose memory, or missing memory,\nor that's a bad video card.\n\n207\n00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.460\nAnd they now know what to change out to\nput in place, and you're in business.\n\n208\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.562\nSo that's a neat way to see it\nis little firmware beep codes.\n\n209\n00:10:06.562 --> 00:10:08.938\nNow as an end user what you\nneed to do is listen to it and\n\n210\n00:10:08.938 --> 00:10:13.650\nif you hear those beep codes that just\nlet's you know there's a hardware problem.\n\n211\n00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.180\nIf it's a Mac that has replaceable\nparts you could try receding them so\n\n212\n00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.080\ntake the memory out put the memory back in\nsometimes it just come loose it happens\n\n213\n00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.880\nbut I've got a mac book pro here, it does\nnot have a single replaceable part in it.\n\n214\n00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.290\nI can't replace the hard drive, the memory\nI can't replace anything inside of it.\n\n215\n00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.820\nIt's a self contain unit.\n\n216\n00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.530\nIf it omits beep codes,\nI have to take it to apple for repair.\n\n217\n00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.585\nThis mac mini.\n\n218\n00:10:36.585 --> 00:10:37.815\nThis is one of the newer Mac Minis.\n\n219\n00:10:37.815 --> 00:10:41.005\nYou can always spot the new ones\ncuz the bottom disc is solid.\n\n220\n00:10:41.005 --> 00:10:42.765\nThere's no replaceable parts in this,\neither.\n\n221\n00:10:42.765 --> 00:10:43.795\nI can't replace anything.\n\n222\n00:10:43.795 --> 00:10:45.425\nI have to take it to Apple.\n\n223\n00:10:45.425 --> 00:10:47.875\nIf you have an older Mac Mini there will\nactually be two little circles here.\n\n224\n00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:50.600\nYou can put your fingers on it and\ntwist the bottom off.\n\n225\n00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.230\nAnd when you do that you can get\nat the memory and the hard drive.\n\n226\n00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:57.090\nAnd so you can reset the hard drive, you\ncan reset the memory and you can test it.\n\n227\n00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.590\nAnd you could even change it out.\n\n228\n00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.350\nIf you have more than one Mac Mini you\ncan swap parts between them to try and\n\n229\n00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.900\nisolate with that problem is\ntheir removal hard drive.\n\n230\n00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.240\nBut in the new ones you don't.\n\n231\n00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.820\nAnd so if you don't have any removal for\n\n232\n00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.150\nhardware, you're gonna\nhave to take it to Apple.\n\n233\n00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.680\nAnd when were talking about firmware\nissues that's normally the case.\n\n234\n00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.470\nThat's normally where we're\ngonna have to deal with that.\n\n235\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.670\nEverything else that happens is\ntypically going to be software related.\n\n236\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.240\nHardware, you get beeps and boops.\n\n237\n00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.840\nThe one time you don't is if\nit's a failed hard drive.\n\n238\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.170\nA failed hard drive won't stop\nyour system from booting.\n\n239\n00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.900\nFailed memory, failed video card,\nfailed motherboard,\n\n240\n00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.210\nall that stuff will stop\nthe system from booting.\n\n241\n00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:39.050\nFailed hard drive, the firmware will\nfire up, the memory initializes,\n\n242\n00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.850\nthe processor initializes,\nthe monitor initializes and\n\n243\n00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.440\nthen if it can't find a bootable\noperating system, it'll show an icon.\n\n244\n00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.420\nInstead of the Apple logo, you'll see\na folder with a question mark on it.\n\n245\n00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.700\nThe folder with a question mark tells you\nhey, I couldn't find an operating system.\n\n246\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.600\nAnd that means either your hard drive\nis bad, or your hard drive is blank or\n\n247\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.100\nthe operating system is corrupt\nthe hard drive might be fine but\n\n248\n00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.630\nsomehow the operating system got\ncorrupted and you can't see it right.\n\n249\n00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.660\nBut we're all ready pass the firmware at\nthat point and we're ready to move into\n\n250\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.460\nthe booter and so if that's not working\nwe can always boot from recovery\n\n251\n00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.640\nyou can boot from a USB installer disk\nyou can boot from internet recovery.\n\n252\n00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.780\nAnd figure that out.\n\n253\n00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.110\nYou should always be able to boot\nfrom the internet recovery if your\n\n254\n00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.520\nhardware is updated.\n\n255\n00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.530\nWell, what if I'm just not certain?\n\n256\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.620\nWhat if I feel like\nthe hardware isn't okay?\n\n257\n00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.750\nThere is actually a hardware diagnostic\nwe can run, and it's kind of neat.\n\n258\n00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.290\nLet me show you here on this Mac.\n\n259\n00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:35.190\nSo, I've got my Mac Mini fired up here,\nand if I suspect there's\n\n260\n00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:39.250\na hardware problem on it there's built\nin hardware diagnostics that we can run.\n\n261\n00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.030\nI'm gonna shut this thing down.\n\n262\n00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:44.860\nAnd it's gonna shut down and power off.\n\n263\n00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.970\nAnd when you boot it up there's\na lot of neat stuff that you can hit\n\n264\n00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.745\nto make it show additional information and\nso\n\n265\n00:12:50.745 --> 00:12:53.545\nyou might have noticed that text\nthat was scrolling across my screen.\n\n266\n00:12:53.545 --> 00:12:56.005\nI have booted this up in\nwhat's called verbose mode so\n\n267\n00:12:56.005 --> 00:12:58.625\nI could see exactly what was\ngoing on during the boot.\n\n268\n00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:00.635\nLet me show you what\nverbose mode looks like.\n\n269\n00:13:00.635 --> 00:13:03.871\nWhat you do is when you power it on,\nyou hold Cmd+V.\n\n270\n00:13:03.871 --> 00:13:09.645\nAnd what Cmd+V does is it shows you all\nthe stuff that happens when you boot up.\n\n271\n00:13:09.645 --> 00:13:11.755\nAnd so I start to see text.\n\n272\n00:13:11.755 --> 00:13:14.080\nNormally I would see the Apple logo here.\n\n273\n00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:14.790\nBut I don't.\n\n274\n00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:15.310\nInstead I see text.\n\n275\n00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.359\nWhat is this?\n\n276\n00:13:16.359 --> 00:13:18.020\nThis is all the stuff\nthat's behind the scene.\n\n277\n00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.460\nThis is what the Apple\nlogo is normally hiding.\n\n278\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.390\nAnd so I could see if there was\na problem in here causing a crash, but\n\n279\n00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.920\nthe problem is,\nthis is the operating system booting up.\n\n280\n00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.710\nSo by the time I see this,\nI'm already at the operating system.\n\n281\n00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.770\nIf I suspect a hardware failure,\nI probably can't even get this far.\n\n282\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:32.540\nRight?\nAnd so\n\n283\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.920\nI probably can't get to this stuff and\nit's not gonna help me, or maybe I do and\n\n284\n00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.910\nstart getting crashes and it freezes,\nand it freezes somewhere in here.\n\n285\n00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.260\nWell, the nice part about this is if it\nfreezes, usually whatever the last text on\n\n286\n00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.360\nthe screen is what your problem is,\nso you can kind of read and see.\n\n287\n00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.760\nIt's not always the case, but that's not\nthe diagnostic I wanted to show you.\n\n288\n00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.680\nThat's just a cool little feature so\nyou can kind of see the OS booting.\n\n289\n00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.362\nBut when I shut down, there we go,\nso now it's actually shut down.\n\n290\n00:13:58.362 --> 00:14:02.681\nI'm gonna power it on and I'm gonna\nhold down the letter d on my keyboard.\n\n291\n00:14:02.681 --> 00:14:03.650\nOkay?\n\n292\n00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.920\nSo I'm just holding that letter d and\n\n293\n00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.280\nas I boot it instead of going to\nthe Apple menu, the Apple logo and\n\n294\n00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.910\nthe little status bar, it's gonna boot\nup into the hardware diagnostics.\n\n295\n00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.580\nSo, if I think my memory is faulty, or\nif I think my hard drive is failing, or\n\n296\n00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.700\nwhatever, boot holding D.\n\n297\n00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.000\nAnd here it goes, it's checking my Mac,\ntwo minutes remaining.\n\n298\n00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.250\nIt's checking my processor, my memory,\nmaking sure the hard drive is visible.\n\n299\n00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.025\nIt's not doing a sector\nscan of the hard drive.\n\n300\n00:14:32.025 --> 00:14:34.590\nCuz a sector scan,\na sector failure or whatever,\n\n301\n00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.920\nthat won't stop you from booting normally.\n\n302\n00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.760\nSo we can always boot to recovery, run\na file system check or whatever that way.\n\n303\n00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.890\nBut this will check in the hardware, the\nmemory, the network card, the motherboard,\n\n304\n00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.060\nthe processor.\n\n305\n00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.010\nAnd it's running some tests.\n\n306\n00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.620\nRunning some quick memory tests and\nlooking to see.\n\n307\n00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.200\nCan I write a one to memory, and then,\nwhen I go and read it, is it still a one?\n\n308\n00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.640\nCan I write a zero to memory, and,\nif I go and read it, is this still a zero?\n\n309\n00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.610\nSo, it's checking the RAM like that.\n\n310\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.922\nThe more RAM you have,\nthe longer this test will take.\n\n311\n00:15:00.922 --> 00:15:04.330\nAnd the processor is checking\nthe processor, if I run this mathematical\n\n312\n00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.890\nequation through the processor,\ndo I get this answer, the answer I expect?\n\n313\n00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.830\nAnd so it runs these tests to\nmake sure that hardware is valid.\n\n314\n00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.220\nWhen its done it's gonna tell me one or\ntwo things.\n\n315\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.210\nIt's either going to say one,\nI've got a hardware problem.\n\n316\n00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.090\nOr two, I need to contact Apple.\n\n317\n00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.318\nNow, I don't know if you guys can\nhear this in the background but\n\n318\n00:15:22.318 --> 00:15:25.580\nmy Mac Mini,\nthe fan just ramped up really loud.\n\n319\n00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.630\nIt was testing the fans.\n\n320\n00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.840\nCan the fans reach full speed or not?\n\n321\n00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.610\nMaybe the fans are dead.\n\n322\n00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:32.970\nAll right,\nhere's the screen that I was looking for.\n\n323\n00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.290\nIf you've got a healthy machine,\nit's gonna look like this.\n\n324\n00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.830\nIt says no issues found,\nI got a healthy machine.\n\n325\n00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.810\nHere's my Reference Code ADP000,\nno problems found.\n\n326\n00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.830\nIf I need more information,\nhere's the serial number of my unit.\n\n327\n00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.680\nI can call Apple, or\nI can go to their website, and\n\n328\n00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.260\nwe can start to find information.\n\n329\n00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.170\nAnd it's got a link, and\nI know what you're thinking.\n\n330\n00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.951\nHow do we go to a link when\nwe're not booted into the OS?\n\n331\n00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:55.463\nIf you click that,\nit'll actually boot to Recovery, and so\n\n332\n00:15:55.463 --> 00:15:58.269\nthat it can use Safari in Recovery\nto be able to get to the website, so\n\n333\n00:15:58.269 --> 00:16:01.249\nyou can still get to Apple's website,\neven though the OS won't boot.\n\n334\n00:16:01.249 --> 00:16:04.440\nBut from a hardware perspective,\nit's telling me that my system is fine.\n\n335\n00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.233\nIf there was a hardware problem,\nif I was missing memory,\n\n336\n00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:11.109\nif one of my memory sticks was bad, if the\nCPU was returning bad results, it would\n\n337\n00:16:11.109 --> 00:16:15.720\ngive me an error code here, and it would\nask me to call Apple and set up a ticket.\n\n338\n00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.010\nAnd I've got the exact information to\nprovide them, and now, we can go and\n\n339\n00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.450\nstart that warranty repair, right?\n\n340\n00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:21.140\nIf it's under warranty.\n\n341\n00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.880\nIf it's not under warranty,\nthen you'll have to pay for it,\n\n342\n00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.940\nbut they can still fix it, all right?\n\n343\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.590\nSo that hardware\ndiagnostic is really cool.\n\n344\n00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.630\nIf you got an older Mac,\n\n345\n00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.510\nthe hardware diagnostics were\nreally cool in the older Macs.\n\n346\n00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.090\nThey let you pick, like, I wanna test\nmemory, or I wanna test hard drive.\n\n347\n00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.920\nYou could do all these different things.\n\n348\n00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.850\nBut here, well, it just runs all\nthe checks at once and it gives us this.\n\n349\n00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.260\nNow, I mentioned the file system check.\n\n350\n00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.440\nSo, the firmware kicks on,\nwe go to boot, and\n\n351\n00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.830\nI get that folder with a question mark.\n\n352\n00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.730\nIt couldn't find the operating system.\n\n353\n00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.448\nWell, the hardware diagnostic doesn't\ncheck to see whether your operating\n\n354\n00:16:51.448 --> 00:16:52.083\nsystem is there.\n\n355\n00:16:52.083 --> 00:16:55.260\nI could have a completely blank hard\ndrive and it would come here and\n\n356\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.870\nsay no issues found, all right?\n\n357\n00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.190\nIt's checking the hardware.\n\n358\n00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.080\nThe operating system,\n\n359\n00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.040\nthat's a problem with the operating\nsystem itself, all right?\n\n360\n00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:07.690\nSo, from that standpoint, I would need\nto look for a problem on the hard drive.\n\n361\n00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.290\nAnd because this doesn't check it,\nI need another way to check it.\n\n362\n00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.060\nThe best way to do it\nis to boot to recovery.\n\n363\n00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.610\nIf you can boot to recovery\nYou can run Disk Utility, and\n\n364\n00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.380\nyou could check your disk, okay?\n\n365\n00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.010\nSo that's one way to go about it.\n\n366\n00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.910\nIf you can boot to Recovery,\nthat usually means your hard drive's good.\n\n367\n00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.050\nBut if your hard drive is failing,\n\n368\n00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:27.110\nthe recovery partition is on your hard\ndrive, so it's probably failing too.\n\n369\n00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:29.620\nAnd in that case you can\ndo one of two things.\n\n370\n00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.700\nYou can boot recovery off of a USB\nmedia disk if you've got one.\n\n371\n00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.850\nOr you can use internet recovery.\n\n372\n00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.240\nInternet recovery is nice,\n\n373\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.830\nbecause you don't even have to\nhave a hard drive in your system.\n\n374\n00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.740\nYour system can boot and\nit'll get the recovery information right\n\n375\n00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:47.050\nfrom Apple's servers and stick it in RAM\nand boot up so you can get into recovery.\n\n376\n00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.300\nThe only negative is it's slow, right?\n\n377\n00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.758\nWhen I boot my computer, if I hold\ncommand R, I'll boot to recovery.\n\n378\n00:17:53.758 --> 00:17:58.430\nBut If I hit command option r,\nI'll boot to internet recovery, right?\n\n379\n00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.920\nSo the Option key is what\nmakes it Internet recovery.\n\n380\n00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.300\nAnd the reason I want to highlight that is\na hardware diagnostics are the same way.\n\n381\n00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.490\nWhen it ran those hardware diagnostics\nit was running it from my hardware.\n\n382\n00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.020\nWhat if I think that's bad?\n\n383\n00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.910\nWell, instead of holding D when I boot it,\nI could hold Option+D.\n\n384\n00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.440\nAnd now it'll try and\nrun them from Apple servers.\n\n385\n00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.280\nBut if I've got problems in my hardware i\nmight not be able to even get that far so\n\n386\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.320\nyou really just try whatever works\nuntil you find when that let you get in\n\n387\n00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.110\nthere and do it.\n\n388\n00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:30.080\nSo, those are few options on the disk side\nI do wanna show you something special\n\n389\n00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.350\nwhich is called Single User Mode.\n\n390\n00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.710\nin the Unix world you can boot\nUnix into two like six modes but\n\n391\n00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.560\nthere's two main modes there's\nmultiuser and single user mode.\n\n392\n00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.460\nIn multiuser, you can have a bunch of\nusers accessing the system at once.\n\n393\n00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.440\nYou can have a bunch of programs\nall running at the same time and\n\n394\n00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.730\nit multitasks and everybody's happy.\n\n395\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:55.210\nThe problem is in multi-user mode no\none person has control of everything.\n\n396\n00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.600\nSo in Unix you can boot\ninto single user mode and\n\n397\n00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.850\nin single user mode you are the only\nperson with access to that system.\n\n398\n00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.620\nYou have exclusive access to everything.\n\n399\n00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.243\nSo if I wanna run a disk check on my\nsystem being in single user mode is\n\n400\n00:19:08.243 --> 00:19:10.010\nthe way to get the best results.\n\n401\n00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.876\nNow I can boot to recovery and when I'm\nin recovery you're effectively the only\n\n402\n00:19:13.876 --> 00:19:18.060\nperson using the system and\nthe disk utility will usually run great.\n\n403\n00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.670\nBut if you can't get into recovery,\nmaybe you don't have a recovery partition.\n\n404\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:26.070\nYou can booth the actual OS10\ninstall to single user mode and\n\n405\n00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:30.150\nthe way you do that is by holding\ncommand S while booting the system.\n\n406\n00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.870\nThat's gonna put you in\nsingle user mode command S.\n\n407\n00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.880\nSo if we wanna see that all I\nhave to do is well I power off\n\n408\n00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.820\nonce again I guess I could use my little\nShut Down button here on the screen.\n\n409\n00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.710\nSo I'm gonna shut the system down again.\n\n410\n00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.610\nAnd this time when I boot\nI'm gonna hold Cmd+S.\n\n411\n00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.880\nAnd you'll see it's kinda\ninteresting what happens.\n\n412\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.970\nSo when it goes to boot I'm gonna\nsee the text based boot process,\n\n413\n00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.084\nkinda like what command V did, right?\n\n414\n00:19:56.084 --> 00:20:00.350\nCommand V showed me the verbose,\nthe text output.\n\n415\n00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:05.170\nCommand S does the same thing except\nright when it gets to the part where it\n\n416\n00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:11.040\nshould be showing me the Apple logo and\nall that stuff it drops me to a shell.\n\n417\n00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.520\nI'm at a bash prompt,\na BSD or Unix bash prompt.\n\n418\n00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.810\nI now have command line access to my\nsystem and I'm the only one in it.\n\n419\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.120\nI'm in single user mode.\n\n420\n00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.830\nI have exclusive access to the hard drive.\n\n421\n00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.260\nWhich means I can do things like\nrunning a Unix file system check.\n\n422\n00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.270\nI can run fsck -fy,\nI know this is really small but\n\n423\n00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.650\nwhen you're in single user mode\nyou can't adjust your resolution.\n\n424\n00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.520\nSo I know it's small for you,\nit's even smaller for me,\n\n425\n00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.820\nI'm having a hard time reading.\n\n426\n00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.090\nBut I can run fsck -fy, right?.\n\n427\n00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:44.570\nFsck is the file system check utility and\nfy says if you find a problem try and\n\n428\n00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.090\nfix it and don't prompt me about it.\n\n429\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:47.100\nJust do it.\n\n430\n00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.420\nAnd so now it's running and\nscanning that hard drive.\n\n431\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.710\nThis is what I can do with disk utility,\nright?\n\n432\n00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.310\nBut here I know I've got\nexclusive access and\n\n433\n00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.500\nI didn't need to load a ton of\noperating system stuff to do it.\n\n434\n00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.440\nIt actually loads about, I don't know,\n5 or 6 megs of data and that's it.\n\n435\n00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.610\nThe whole rest of the hard drive can\nbe corrupt and now we can scan it and\n\n436\n00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:05.180\nlook for problems.\n\n437\n00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.640\nAnd here it's just telling me that my\nhard drive appears to be okay, right?\n\n438\n00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.490\nSo single user mode is another neat\nway that we can get in there and\n\n439\n00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.640\ntroubleshoot this if\nrecovery is not an option.\n\n440\n00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.370\nRecovery is the better way to go\nthough that's normally what we want.\n\n441\n00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.670\nSo single user mode,\nI just did command S to boot up.\n\n442\n00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:24.430\nAll right, so I talked about the firmware\nfiring up, that's the first step.\n\n443\n00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.258\nWhen you push the power button the\nfirmware kicks in the hardware starts to\n\n444\n00:21:27.258 --> 00:21:28.590\nload that's what's happening.\n\n445\n00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:31.969\nAs soon as the hardware is happy, right?\n\n446\n00:21:31.969 --> 00:21:36.496\nOur CPU is powered up, our video card\nis working, our motherboard is happy,\n\n447\n00:21:36.496 --> 00:21:38.390\nwe see our hard drives.\n\n448\n00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:42.020\nWe move to the second stage and\nthe second stage is the booter, right?\n\n449\n00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.940\nThe booter is where we go to\nfind our operating system.\n\n450\n00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.610\nSo let me boot the system back up.\n\n451\n00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.760\nAnd that's where we actually start\nto hand over control to OS X.\n\n452\n00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:56.620\nWell, the firmware on your Mac uses EFI,\nthat Extensible Firmware Interface that I\n\n453\n00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:01.920\nwas talking about earlier, and\nwith EFI it needs to find an EFI boot\n\n454\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:07.580\nloader somewhere on your system and so\nApple's booter Is just an EFI bootloader.\n\n455\n00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.130\nThat's all it is, and\nit's stored on your hard drive.\n\n456\n00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.230\nIt's tucked away in the file system.\n\n457\n00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.140\nWe can actually find it and\n\n458\n00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.070\nsee it .I'll show you as soon\nas my system's done booting up.\n\n459\n00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:20.530\nBut that booter, the booter is what's\nactually responsible for well,\n\n460\n00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.880\nbooting up OS X.\n\n461\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.790\nSo when I'm in the firmware or\n\n462\n00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:29.260\nwhen I'm in EFI, I'm not actually in\nOS X yet, those are other systems.\n\n463\n00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.400\nIt's not until I get to the booter that\nI actually start to see OS X fire up.\n\n464\n00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.608\nOne little caveat I need to throw in on\nthat is if you've got FileVault turned on.\n\n465\n00:22:37.608 --> 00:22:42.170\nIf you've got FileVault turned on,\nwhen you boot it up and\n\n466\n00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.300\nyou get that login screen,\nit's actually booting to recovery.\n\n467\n00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.250\nIt's booting to recovery cuz\nrecovery is unencrypted.\n\n468\n00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:49.900\nAnd that way you can see\na login in screen and\n\n469\n00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.880\nwhen you provide your login credentials\nthen it goes and fires up OS X, right?\n\n470\n00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.380\nSo that's when we start to see that\nthing fire up and do all it's work.\n\n471\n00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.750\nSo it's a little bit different\nwhat happens based on\n\n472\n00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.630\nwhether you have FileVault turned on or\nnot.\n\n473\n00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.840\nBut if FileVault's not turned on,\nyou can go right to your system,\n\n474\n00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.318\nfind your main booter,\nAnd start to boot OS X.\n\n475\n00:23:08.318 --> 00:23:14.800\nApparently my [LAUGH] booting\nin single user mode played havoc\n\n476\n00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.360\nwith my wireless keyboard here, so it's\ntelling me that it can't find my keyboard.\n\n477\n00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.080\nLet me try and wake it up here real quick.\n\n478\n00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.940\nThere's an interesting point, a lot of\nMacs have wireless keyboards these days.\n\n479\n00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.070\nSo if I'm gonna boot to a diagnostic mode,\nis my wireless keyboard gonna work?\n\n480\n00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.080\nWell, it actually will.\n\n481\n00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.770\nApple has baked it into the firmware that\nwhen you connect a Bluetooth keyboard or\n\n482\n00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:39.830\na Bluetooth touchpad or whatever that when\nit boots to recovery, when it boots to\n\n483\n00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:45.010\nthe hardware diagnostics or whatever, your\nwireless devices will continue to work.\n\n484\n00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.010\nAnd so that's a neat thing.\n\n485\n00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.320\nI've been using my wireless\nkeyboard the whole time.\n\n486\n00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.712\nBut because I went into single user\nmode and then booted up like this,\n\n487\n00:23:52.712 --> 00:23:54.770\nit's kind of disconnected my keyboard.\n\n488\n00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.892\nSo I need to just shutdown and\npower it back on.\n\n489\n00:23:56.892 --> 00:23:59.050\nIf you have a wired keyboard\nthat wouldn't have happened.\n\n490\n00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:01.562\nBut because I've been messing with it,\nit's kind of lost mine, or\n\n491\n00:24:01.562 --> 00:24:02.899\nI guess I could be out of batteries.\n\n492\n00:24:02.899 --> 00:24:04.168\nThere's several different\noptions that could happen there.\n\n493\n00:24:04.168 --> 00:24:08.420\n[LAUGH] But\nthe booter is kind of the important part.\n\n494\n00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.460\nThat's what I wanted to show you guys.\n\n495\n00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.310\nAnd the booter is actually stored in\nthe core services on your hard drive.\n\n496\n00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.670\nAnd so it's tucked away\nunder the System folder, and\n\n497\n00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:20.240\nit's a little EFI file that's\nsitting in our hard drive.\n\n498\n00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.880\nIt's actually really\nnot impressive at all.\n\n499\n00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.940\nBut for the exam they might ask\nyou to find out where it is.\n\n500\n00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.460\nSo I wanna show you guys that,\nand we'll take a look at it.\n\n501\n00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.230\nAll right, so now that I'm in my system,\nlet me just jump in here, and\n\n502\n00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.630\nI'll show you guys where\nthat booter is stored.\n\n503\n00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:36.160\nIt's tucked away on the hard drive, and so\nit's in the core services of the system.\n\n504\n00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:44.046\nIf I get into\n/System/Library/CoreServices.\n\n505\n00:24:44.046 --> 00:24:48.428\nSo, I'm gonna go into that folder and just\nkinda take a look at all that's in there,\n\n506\n00:24:48.428 --> 00:24:52.090\nand the one that I'm looking for\nis this guy right here, boot.efi.\n\n507\n00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:57.190\nSo, that was\n/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi\n\n508\n00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.810\nthat's the booter, right.\n\n509\n00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:03.660\nIt's an efi file which means when\nthe firmware hands over control to efi,\n\n510\n00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.130\nefi looks for this guy right here.\n\n511\n00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.560\nAnd the boot.efi is the Apple booter and\n\n512\n00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.790\nnow what we see it as\nis one of two things.\n\n513\n00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:13.760\nWe either see it as the Apple logo or\nthe globe.\n\n514\n00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.270\nIf you're doing Internet recovery or\nwhatever, it's the globe that spins.\n\n515\n00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.490\nIf you're doing a regular boot or regular\nrecovery, you see the Apple logo and\n\n516\n00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:22.360\nthe menu bar, that's this guy.\n\n517\n00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.100\nThat's boot.efi that's generating that.\n\n518\n00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.060\nSo that's the booter.\n\n519\n00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:30.068\nAnd, if you can't get to the booter,\nit's almost always a hard drive problem.\n\n520\n00:25:30.068 --> 00:25:33.254\nEither the booter is missing,\nit's corrupt, the hard drive has been\n\n521\n00:25:33.254 --> 00:25:37.098\nformatted, it's got bad sectors, there's\nsomething wrong with the hard drive.\n\n522\n00:25:37.098 --> 00:25:41.008\nBecause we're past the hardware at that\npoint, we've now made it to where we're\n\n523\n00:25:41.008 --> 00:25:44.410\nlaunching our operating system and\nwe booted to the booter.\n\n524\n00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:48.160\nSo assuming that our system is able to get\nto the point where it can hit boot.efi and\n\n525\n00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.930\nlaunch the booter then\nthe booter has one real job.\n\n526\n00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.160\nFind OS X and get it running, right?\n\n527\n00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.130\nBooter is that first step for getting\nthe operating system actually fired up, so\n\n528\n00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.390\nthe Apple logo comes up or\nthe globe comes up, and now it says,\n\n529\n00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:03.640\nI gotta go find that operating system.\n\n530\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.876\nAnd it's usually right here\non the hard drive with it.\n\n531\n00:26:05.876 --> 00:26:07.235\nIt's usually in /System and\n\n532\n00:26:07.235 --> 00:26:10.695\nthat's where this file is, so\nit's not a hard search to find it.\n\n533\n00:26:10.695 --> 00:26:14.175\nBut if you put a new hard drive in,\nthe OS is missing or the OS is damaged,\n\n534\n00:26:14.175 --> 00:26:15.995\nthen it's gonna have\na little bit of a problem.\n\n535\n00:26:15.995 --> 00:26:19.325\nNow it goes to find the operating system,\nand\n\n536\n00:26:19.325 --> 00:26:21.785\nthe way it finds is by looking for\nthe kernel.\n\n537\n00:26:21.785 --> 00:26:24.935\nSo you know this is running BSD Unix, and\n\n538\n00:26:24.935 --> 00:26:27.665\nBSD Unix at the heart of it\nis what you call the kernel.\n\n539\n00:26:27.665 --> 00:26:30.540\nThe actual operating system is\ntied to an application file,\n\n540\n00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.360\nkind of like all of our\nother applications.\n\n541\n00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.280\nI know used Cyberduck in earlier\nshows where I had that .app file.\n\n542\n00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.530\nWell BSD has a kernel, and that kernel\nis what powers the whole thing.\n\n543\n00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.450\nAnd the process that we'll see,\n\n544\n00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:45.900\nthat's visible to us, is what's called\nthe launcher or the launcher daemon.\n\n545\n00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:51.320\nSo the launcher daemon is what\nfires up as part of the kernel,\n\n546\n00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.700\nand then launches all the other stuff.\n\n547\n00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.890\nThe graphical user interface,\nthe icons, the menu bar, the dock.\n\n548\n00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.800\nEverything else that we do is\nbeing launched by the launcher.\n\n549\n00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.800\nAll the services that run in\nthe background, all the functions of BSD.\n\n550\n00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.960\nAll the stuff we need to make our system\ndo what it does, the launcher fires up.\n\n551\n00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.690\nAll right, when you first power on the\nsystem, and it goes to the booter, there's\n\n552\n00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:21.100\ncertain processes like the launcher\ndemon itself that runs as the system.\n\n553\n00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.860\nBut once we log in, we start running\nprograms and they run as us.\n\n554\n00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:29.510\nBut at this stage in boot,\nyou power it on, EFI kicks in.\n\n555\n00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:33.000\nWell the firmware kicks in and it hands\nover to EFI which launches the booter.\n\n556\n00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.680\nThen the booter fires up launch D.\n\n557\n00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.210\nAnd launch D starts to do some work.\n\n558\n00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.630\nEverything at this stage is\nstill at the system level, so\n\n559\n00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:42.940\nit's all running as the core system.\n\n560\n00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.839\nThat's why we see things like this tucked\naway under Core Services, all right?\n\n561\n00:27:46.839 --> 00:27:47.960\nNow, launch D,\n\n562\n00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.980\nthe way we see it is simply as the first\nprocess running on our system.\n\n563\n00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.288\nIf I launch the Activity Monitor,\nlet me fire up the Activity Monitor,\n\n564\n00:27:56.288 --> 00:27:59.816\nand in the Activity Monitor we see all\nthe programs running in the background\n\n565\n00:27:59.816 --> 00:28:00.938\non our system, right?\n\n566\n00:28:00.938 --> 00:28:04.570\nAnd you may have a ton of programs,\nyou might have just a handful,\n\n567\n00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:08.418\nit depends on how long your system\nhas been online and all that stuff.\n\n568\n00:28:08.418 --> 00:28:13.346\nYou may see a ton of stuff in here,\nit may be mostly empty, but when you look,\n\n569\n00:28:13.346 --> 00:28:16.780\nevery process that runs\nhas a process ID right.\n\n570\n00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.560\nSo like if I fire up Safari,\nI'm gonna launch Safari,\n\n571\n00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.720\nand if I go back to the Activity Monitor\nand I find Safari in here.\n\n572\n00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.848\nThere it is and\nI can see that its process ID is 371.\n\n573\n00:28:27.848 --> 00:28:29.841\nIt's the, well, potentially,\n\n574\n00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:33.700\n371st process that I've launched\nsince the system turned on.\n\n575\n00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.810\nNow, the number does wrap around,\neventually, so it could be that I've been\n\n576\n00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:40.450\nrunning for weeks and weeks and\nweeks, and this just shows 371 now.\n\n577\n00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.640\nBut since I just powered\nthis up this morning,\n\n578\n00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.850\nthis is probably the 371st\nprocess I've run.\n\n579\n00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:48.930\nWell, you guys saw,\nI just booted this up a second ago.\n\n580\n00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.560\nI didn't run anything.\n\n581\n00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.560\nWell, I guess I ran Terminal,\nso I could browse and\n\n582\n00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.410\nshow you where the boot.efi was.\n\n583\n00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.500\nI think I accidentally\nlaunched Time Machine.\n\n584\n00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.240\nI didn't run 370 things.\n\n585\n00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.300\nWell that just shows you how many\nthings the launcher has to fire up,\n\n586\n00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.180\nall these different services and\nprocesses that are running.\n\n587\n00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:13.690\nIf I take this and I sort by process ID,\nand I look for the first process to run.\n\n588\n00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.638\nWell, I don't see it, it starts with 88.\n\n589\n00:29:16.638 --> 00:29:20.220\nAnd if I look over here,\nI'll see that that's loginwindow.\n\n590\n00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.950\nWell, that's the first\nprocess that ran for me.\n\n591\n00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:28.430\nWhat I'm seeing here is a list\nof processes that I ran,\n\n592\n00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:32.770\nnot necessarily a list of all\nthe processes running on the system.\n\n593\n00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.660\nProcess ID number one is the launcher.\n\n594\n00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.730\nIt's launch D.\n\n595\n00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.370\nThe launcher daemon is\nprocess ID number one.\n\n596\n00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:43.090\nIt's the first process that runs.\n\n597\n00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.160\nAnd it powers on our operating system.\n\n598\n00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.136\nIt gets us to the login window.\n\n599\n00:29:49.136 --> 00:29:52.230\nThe login window is the first in that we\nreally see that we can interact with and\n\n600\n00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.140\nthe login window has its own process.\n\n601\n00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:58.980\nWhen you log in, you can fire it up,\nyour Activity Monitor, and\n\n602\n00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.830\nlogin window should be\nthe first process you have.\n\n603\n00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:03.610\nLogin window is important, don't kill it.\n\n604\n00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.570\nCuz you can kill a process in here if\nyou want, but you don't want to do that.\n\n605\n00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:11.894\nBecause every program that you\nrun is being run by login window.\n\n606\n00:30:11.894 --> 00:30:14.494\nLogin window is making sure that\nall the programs run as used, so\n\n607\n00:30:14.494 --> 00:30:16.700\nthey have your permissions.\n\n608\n00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.720\nIf it runs with somebody else,\nit's going to have their permissions, so\n\n609\n00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.290\nit needs to be tied to the user.\n\n610\n00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.760\nThe login window is what we see.\n\n611\n00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.530\nSo the launcher kicks in,\nfires up the operating system,\n\n612\n00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.620\ngets us to the login window,\nand then we log in.\n\n613\n00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.720\nSo those two processes\nare really important.\n\n614\n00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.880\nNow, launch D, if you ever want\nto find it on the hard drive,\n\n615\n00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.560\nthere's not a lot of reason for it but\non the exam they might reference it.\n\n616\n00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.740\nIt's actually stored in a hidden\ndirectory, which is /sbin.\n\n617\n00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.790\nSo /sbin is a binary directory,\nwhich has system binaries.\n\n618\n00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:50.270\nAnd if you look around in there,\nyou can find it right there, launchd.\n\n619\n00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.640\nSo it's called the launcher, but\nthe actual command is launchd.\n\n620\n00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:57.720\nSo you'll hear people call it launchd,\nlauncher, launcherd, or\n\n621\n00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.940\nthe launcher daemon,\nit's all referring to the same thing.\n\n622\n00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.310\nBut that's where launchd is.\n\n623\n00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:07.180\nAnd when it fires up, it starts to\nlaunch all this other stuff, right.\n\n624\n00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.940\nLike our kernel extensions and mounting\ndisks and some of these other functions.\n\n625\n00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.920\nThey're all being called by launchd,\nit's really an important piece.\n\n626\n00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.052\nAnd it's right here on the hard drive,\n\n627\n00:31:17.052 --> 00:31:19.750\nif this gets damaged we can't\nboot our operating system.\n\n628\n00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.180\nAll right, next is the login window,\nwhich I kind of already talked about.\n\n629\n00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.500\nWe get to the login window and\nthat's we can pick our user accounts,\n\n630\n00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.890\nif you've got more than one user account.\n\n631\n00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.420\nIf you don't have one user or\nmore than one,\n\n632\n00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.050\nyou just see this single account, right.\n\n633\n00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:36.140\nSo if I log out,\nI'll just log out of this system.\n\n634\n00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:40.000\nAnd once I log out, I'm gonna see\nthe login window, right here.\n\n635\n00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.510\nSo the system boots up, launch D fires up.\n\n636\n00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:48.340\nIt launches all the background services,\nand it launches login window.\n\n637\n00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.590\nAnd now, here it is,\nready for me to log in.\n\n638\n00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.200\nOr for me to log in as a different user,\nif I have more than one.\n\n639\n00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.009\nWhich I don't.\n\n640\n00:31:54.009 --> 00:31:58.965\nBut after I log in,\nI'm interacting with the log in window and\n\n641\n00:31:58.965 --> 00:32:00.979\nI'm telling it who I am.\n\n642\n00:32:00.979 --> 00:32:05.710\nNow the login window can\nchange context and be me.\n\n643\n00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:09.780\nAnd so now the login window is\nbeing me and every program I run\n\n644\n00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.070\nevery time I launch the finder or\nother programs they gonna run as me.\n\n645\n00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:17.740\nSo when I look in the activity monitor and\nI look it all this processes.\n\n646\n00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.090\nLook at the user column.\n\n647\n00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:19.980\nUser, Don Pezet.\n\n648\n00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.510\nLogin Windows shows it's running as me.\n\n649\n00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:27.170\nAs I scroll down and look at all this\nstuff, it's all running as Don Pezet and\n\n650\n00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:30.870\nthat's because the activity monitor\nis showing me all of that stuff\n\n651\n00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:32.270\nfrom the perspective of me.\n\n652\n00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.650\nIf you really want to have some fun,\n\n653\n00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:39.590\nyou can drop to a terminal, which I keep\nforgetting I have open in the background.\n\n654\n00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:45.190\nAnd you can do a PS AUX, PS is\nthe BSD command for showing processes.\n\n655\n00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:48.490\nAnd when you run that, it'll show\nyou all the processes on the system.\n\n656\n00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:53.050\nAnd see how it's showing one's owned\nby me as well as one's owned by root.\n\n657\n00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:54.340\nRoots the system.\n\n658\n00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.830\nSo before I login,\n\n659\n00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:59.630\nall that stuff that launchd is firing up,\nit's firing up as root.\n\n660\n00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:02.720\nAnd in fact,\nhere's the process ID column, and\n\n661\n00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.880\nI can see root running\nprocess ID number one.\n\n662\n00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:10.500\nAnd if I scroll over to figure out\nwhat process ID number one is,\n\n663\n00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.270\nI am apparently trimming it off, so\n\n664\n00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.570\nit doesn't have enough room on the screen\nhere to show me the name of that process.\n\n665\n00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:21.610\nLet me do, let's see that's\n\n666\n00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:27.240\njust me gotta remember\nthe command to actually see it.\n\n667\n00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.300\nThen we can try and find it here.\n\n668\n00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.930\nThere we go.\n\n669\n00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.490\nAnd so look at process ID number one.\n\n670\n00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:36.620\nRight there, either PSAX.\n\n671\n00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.670\nWhen I added U,\nthat was showing the User Name, and\n\n672\n00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:41.740\nit made it all too big for the screen.\n\n673\n00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:46.880\nSo I dropped off U, and now I've got\nProcess ID number one is / sbin/ launchd.\n\n674\n00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.600\nRight.\nThat's the very first thing that fires up.\n\n675\n00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.650\nLogin Window.\n\n676\n00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:51.470\nThat was process 88.\n\n677\n00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.190\nRight.\n\n678\n00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:56.490\nAnd if I kind of scroll down and\nlook for 88, actually you know what?\n\n679\n00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:59.010\nI logged out and logged back in,\nso the login Window relaunched.\n\n680\n00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:00.960\nSo the login Window will\nhave a new process ID.\n\n681\n00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.620\nSo somewhere in here I'll find\nthat login Window again and\n\n682\n00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.720\nit'll have a higher process ID number,\nwherever the heck it is.\n\n683\n00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.810\nBut look at some of the other processes\nthat fired up when the system booted.\n\n684\n00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.230\nYou've got things like syslogd.\n\n685\n00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.900\nThat's our logging.\n\n686\n00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.780\nIf something goes wrong we need to\nsee logs nd that's our logging.\n\n687\n00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.150\nOur kernel extension daemon,right.\n\n688\n00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:21.270\nSo that we can launch all of our kernel\nextensions, our hardware driver support,\n\n689\n00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:25.070\nall of that is being fired up by launchd\nand loaded at that point, right.\n\n690\n00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:29.440\nSo we have a ton of stuff that happens\nbefore we even get to our login Window.\n\n691\n00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.090\nNow if you have a problem at these stages\nthese are not things where we can say\n\n692\n00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:34.540\nI'll drop to the shell and\nstart to fix this stuff.\n\n693\n00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.770\nUsually it means you need to boot\nto recovery and reinstall OS X.\n\n694\n00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:41.120\nAnd you can reinstall OS X right on\ntop of your current install, and\n\n695\n00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.630\nit'll hopefully fix all the issues that\nyou've got, and you don't lose any data.\n\n696\n00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:46.440\nYou boot back in and you're fine.\n\n697\n00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.430\nBut if you've got a failing hard drive,\nyou need to buy a new hard drive and\n\n698\n00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:50.880\nrestore from Time Machine.\n\n699\n00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.400\nWhen you restore from Time Machine,\nit's got all this stuff backed up and\n\n700\n00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.000\nit loads it back in.\n\n701\n00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.300\nAll right,\nwell I've got a lot more to talk about.\n\n702\n00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.880\nBut in this episode,\nI've kind of run pretty far over time.\n\n703\n00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.400\nSo let's stop here.\n\n704\n00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.720\nAnd I'm gonna do a part two on this one.\n\n705\n00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.260\nI've got a little more to talk about on\ntroubleshooting some other special little\n\n706\n00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.010\nthings that we can use when we boot the\nsystem up to pick what we are gonna do.\n\n707\n00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:12.170\nSo I definitely want to get to that.\n\n708\n00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:14.220\nBut for right now,\nthis is a good spot to wrap it up.\n\n709\n00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.190\nSo let me kinda just\nrecap what we went over.\n\n710\n00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:19.210\nI started talking about the boot\nprocess that we go through.\n\n711\n00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:22.810\nAnd so we saw step one,\nwhich was the firmware of the system.\n\n712\n00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:26.600\nThen we saw step two,\nwhich was EFI kicking in the BIOS.\n\n713\n00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.490\nStep three,\n\n714\n00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:30.960\nwas the booter when we actually launched\nthat booter to find the operating system.\n\n715\n00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.880\nAnd step four was launchd.\n\n716\n00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.960\nLaunchd was kicking in and\nstarting to launch those services.\n\n717\n00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.160\nStep five, the login Window.\n\n718\n00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.660\nWe actually see the login Window, so\nwe can login and start running processes.\n\n719\n00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.360\nIf we have a failure\nanywhere along the way\n\n720\n00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.790\nthere's different tools that are available\nfor us to fix each one of those.\n\n721\n00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:49.860\nAnd we saw the hardware diagnostics,\nright that was one.\n\n722\n00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.670\nI should single user mode for\nbeing able to get to that command line.\n\n723\n00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:56.100\nAnd I've showed verbose mode,\nthe Command+V option, so\n\n724\n00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.680\nwe can see the text\nrunning across the screen.\n\n725\n00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.470\nI still need to talk about safe boot and\nsafe mode.\n\n726\n00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.580\nI still need to talk a little bit about\nrecovery and I didn't get to those here.\n\n727\n00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.320\nSo we're gonna do a part two, so\nI can tackle some of those other ones that\n\n728\n00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.670\nare great utilities, definitely ones that\ncan help you with getting into the system.\n\n729\n00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:13.340\nAnd I haven't even finished\nthe boot process because\n\n730\n00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:17.150\nafter that step five where we get\nour login Window we log in and\n\n731\n00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.970\nthen we still have our login actions\nthat happen right after that.\n\n732\n00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:22.650\nThat's step six before we\ntruly see our desktop.\n\n733\n00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.800\nSo I wanna talk about those two,\ndefinitely stay tuned for part two.\n\n734\n00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.582\nAlright, well that's a good spot for\n\n735\n00:36:27.582 --> 00:36:31.158\nus to wrap this one up I do hope you guys\nenjoyed it and stay tuned for part two.\n\n736\n00:36:31.158 --> 00:36:35.678\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet and I'll see you next time.\n\n737\n00:36:35.678 --> 00:36:41.818\n[SOUND]\n\n",

episode.\n\n3\n00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.132\nI'm your host Don Pazet,\n\n4\n00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:21.138\nready to jump right back into the world\nof Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:21.138 --> 00:00:25.962\nAnd if you've been watching the shows in\norder, then you know this is part two of\n\n6\n00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:30.290\nour system bootup process and\nbasic system troubleshooting episode.\n\n7\n00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.790\nWe started it in the last episode and\nI spent so\n\n8\n00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.450\nmuch time running through\nthe whole boot process, so\n\n9\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.930\nwe didn't get to everything that I wanted\nto cover so we're back for part two.\n\n10\n00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.300\nSo just to recap in the last episode,\nwhat we were talking about were\n\n11\n00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.430\nall the different things that happen\nwhen you power your system on.\n\n12\n00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.070\nWhen you push that power button,\n\n13\n00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.600\nthe first thing that happened\nwas the firmware kicked in.\n\n14\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.150\nAnd the firmware would run a hardware test\non your system to make sure it was okay.\n\n15\n00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.475\nAssuming it was,\nit would then kick on EFI.\n\n16\n00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:57.570\nEFI was like the BIOS infrastructure, and\n\n17\n00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.680\nit would reach out to your hard drive to\nfind the next step, which was the booter.\n\n18\n00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.440\nThe booter was the process that, actually,\nfinds, and runs your operating system.\n\n19\n00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.180\nIt boots your operating system.\n\n20\n00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.900\nSo, the booter would then turn around, and\nlook for launchd in the kernel of BSD.\n\n21\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.190\nSo, it would fire up the kernel,\nand fire up launchd.\n\n22\n00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.520\nLaunchd would be the very\nfirst process that we run.\n\n23\n00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.750\nLaunchd would kick in and\nstart running all of your Mac services.\n\n24\n00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.680\nAnd once that was done it would\nfire up a very important process\n\n25\n00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.430\ncalled the Login Window.\n\n26\n00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.640\nThe Login Window is what we\nwould see as an end user.\n\n27\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.920\nWe put in our username and password.\n\n28\n00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.350\nAnd once we log in,\nthe login Window runs on our behalf and\n\n29\n00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.480\nstarts running all of\nour applications as us.\n\n30\n00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.170\nAnd that's where we left off\nat the end of that episode.\n\n31\n00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.270\nAnd the thing that I wanted to\nmention was that login window\n\n32\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.885\ndoes a lot more than just\nshows you your desktop.\n\n33\n00:01:45.885 --> 00:01:51.290\nLogin window is also turning around and\nlaunching start up applications for us.\n\n34\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.925\nWe might have applications and programs\nthat we, as a user, want to start.\n\n35\n00:01:54.925 --> 00:01:57.770\nLaunchd runs services that\nthe system wants to start.\n\n36\n00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.270\nAnd it runs them whether we log in or not.\n\n37\n00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.530\nBut the launch services that\nare tied to our accounts,\n\n38\n00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.740\nthey run only when we log in.\n\n39\n00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.550\nAll right, you can see those in\nthe operating system pretty easily, but\n\n40\n00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.590\nthere's some little caveats\nthat I wanna throw in.\n\n41\n00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.330\nSo let's start with the easy part I guess.\n\n42\n00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.200\nSo here I'm logged in to el capitan.\n\n43\n00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.890\nAnd if I go into system preferences,\nand I go into users and\n\n44\n00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.760\ngroups I can find my user account so\nthere I'm down Don Pezet.\n\n45\n00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.550\nAnd see I've got these login items\nup here, when I go to login items\n\n46\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.850\nthese are are programs that\nare gonna run every time I log in.\n\n47\n00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.260\nSo when I log in this program is\ngonna launch and run all inside me.\n\n48\n00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.580\nNow what programs do I\nwanna run when I login?\n\n49\n00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.940\nWell, it's not gonna be\nsomething like Microsoft Word.\n\n50\n00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.800\nI don't want Word to launch\nevery time I log in.\n\n51\n00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.640\nBut maybe I have some screen sharing\nsoftware or something that I need.\n\n52\n00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.670\nI know on my laptop I have the software\nthat lets me quickly manage window\n\n53\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.530\npositions.\n\n54\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.470\nSo I get keyboard shortcuts to move\nwindows around on my screen and\n\n55\n00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.760\nI want that to boot every time I login.\n\n56\n00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.740\nAnd so that's in my start up items\nright here so that I can go in, and\n\n57\n00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.990\nget that software and not actually\nhave to think about launching it.\n\n58\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.230\nI have other software that I run\nthat lets me map network drives,\n\n59\n00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.540\nspecial network drives,\nnot the kind that are supported in OS X.\n\n60\n00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.800\nAnd so I have that software\nrun every time that I boot up.\n\n61\n00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.240\nSo there's things like that that\ncan make life little easier.\n\n62\n00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.590\nIf you've installed iTunes,\nyou'll see an iTunesHelper in here.\n\n63\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.890\nIn fact, I'm kind of surprised\nI don't see it because,\n\n64\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.680\nlet me maybe just because\nI haven't run iTunes yet.\n\n65\n00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.890\nSo if I launch iTunes,\n\n66\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.040\nnow it knows hey you're gonna\nagree to that license agreement.\n\n67\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.160\nAnd when I launch iTunes,\nit takes a minute to run.\n\n68\n00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.780\nIt's gotta find the iTunes database.\n\n69\n00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.540\nIt's gotta access it.\n\n70\n00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.310\nIt's gotta queue it up and load it.\n\n71\n00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.130\nIf we have the iTunesHelper installed,\n\n72\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.590\nthen when you launch your operating system\nthe iTunesHelper is already available.\n\n73\n00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.470\nIt's already there and\nit's kinda ready to launch.\n\n74\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.720\nSo when you launch it it'll launch a lot\nfaster and have your library indexed.\n\n75\n00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.660\nSo if I go back into System Preferences,\n\n76\n00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.810\nwe'll see if that was enough\nto get it added to me.\n\n77\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.040\nAnd I go back to Users, and I go back\nto my login items, and there it is.\n\n78\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.170\nI've got the iTunesHelper showing up,\nright?\n\n79\n00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.030\nSo now, every time my system boots, iTunes\nwill be running at the background just\n\n80\n00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.830\nwaiting for me to click on\nthat music file or waiting for\n\n81\n00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.500\nme to go to a website that has\na link to an iTunes store file.\n\n82\n00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.190\nSo when I click on it will\ngo right in the iTunes.\n\n83\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.950\nIt speeds things up.\n\n84\n00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.214\nNow on a positive note,\n\n85\n00:04:19.214 --> 00:04:23.670\nit makes these programs available\nas soon as we log in that's great.\n\n86\n00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.830\nOn a negative note, it could be one of\nthese programs that's causing my problem.\n\n87\n00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.720\nMaking it where I can't\nget in to the system.\n\n88\n00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.870\nSo let's kind of revisit that.\n\n89\n00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.160\nIf I power on my system and\n\n90\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.750\nI don't get the Apple logo, well that's\nwhere we probably have a hardware issue.\n\n91\n00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.210\nAnd that's where we can go in\na hardware diagnostic so we can try and\n\n92\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.020\nboot to recovery,\nyour Internet recovery or\n\n93\n00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.230\nthose guys that we talked\nabout in the last episode.\n\n94\n00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.180\nBut if I get the Apple logo, and\n\n95\n00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.850\nthen it stops after the Apple logo and\nI don't get a log in screen,\n\n96\n00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.225\nwell that could be any of the services\nthat start when my system boots up.\n\n97\n00:04:58.225 --> 00:05:00.170\nLaunchd is running those services.\n\n98\n00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.350\nIf I don't get to a login window and\nI have a crash or\n\n99\n00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.300\na freeze,\nit's something that launchd is doing.\n\n100\n00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.150\nSo it's probably one of\nthose startup services.\n\n101\n00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.300\nIf I get to a login window and\nI log in and\n\n102\n00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.150\nthen the system freezes\nbefore I get to my desktop.\n\n103\n00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.340\nIt's probably these guys,\nthe launch items.\n\n104\n00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.882\nThese login items right here that\nthe login window is running.\n\n105\n00:05:22.882 --> 00:05:28.030\nSo launchd can get frozen or\nlogin window can get frozen.\n\n106\n00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.980\nAnd the only difference is whether it\nhappens before or after the login screen.\n\n107\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.400\nIf it happens after the login screen,\nwe can just come in and\n\n108\n00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.340\nturn these things off.\n\n109\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.370\nYou can choose it, and don't hit hide.\n\n110\n00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.690\nHide just makes it not\nshow up on the screen.\n\n111\n00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.385\nYou can choose it and just hit the minus,\nand now it's not gonna start up.\n\n112\n00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.940\niTunesHelper's gone,\nit's not gonna start up.\n\n113\n00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.630\nRight, so\nit's just kind of easy to fix that.\n\n114\n00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.240\nIf you can get to it, if I have a second\nuser account that I can log in that\n\n115\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.740\ndoesn't have the iTunesHelper, and\nI can go in and maybe remove it, but\n\n116\n00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.080\nif I can't get to this utility,\nit's kind of hard to fix, isn't it?\n\n117\n00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.770\nLaunchd is even harder.\n\n118\n00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.070\nIf I've got a service that runs before\nI even get to the login window,\n\n119\n00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.090\nhow the heck do I fix that?\n\n120\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.060\nWell, Apple has two special\nboot modes that we can use.\n\n121\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.490\nOne is called safe boot, and\none is called safe mode.\n\n122\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.510\nThey're very easy to confuse, in real\nlife, I usually don't care about the name,\n\n123\n00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.580\nI just know how they work.\n\n124\n00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.700\nBut on the exam,\nyou've got to know the name.\n\n125\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.080\nSafe mode is the most common.\n\n126\n00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.870\nSafe mode says I wanna log in and I don't\nwant you to run any of these login items.\n\n127\n00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.505\nIn other words,\nlog me in without running login items.\n\n128\n00:06:32.505 --> 00:06:36.020\nSo if login window is what's freezing,\nthis will get us around it so\n\n129\n00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.400\nwe can get in and we can fix it.\n\n130\n00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.140\nSo let's just kinda do an example here.\n\n131\n00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.170\nI'm gonna go into my login items and\n\n132\n00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.900\nI'm gonna add, let's add some\napplications in here, right?\n\n133\n00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.950\nSo I'm gonna add may be calculator.\n\n134\n00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.110\nWhere's calculator?\n\n135\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.100\nRight there, so I'm gonna add\ncalculator to my login items and\n\n136\n00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.860\nI'll add maybe Safari also.\n\n137\n00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.111\nOkay so we'll get that one, reminders,\npreview any of these programs I might feel\n\n138\n00:07:01.111 --> 00:07:06.380\nis super critical to me, I can add them\nand have them in my login items, okay.\n\n139\n00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.340\nSo now If I logout and log back in.\n\n140\n00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.090\nLet me just close out of all these stuff,\nwhoops.\n\n141\n00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.890\nTry and close this,\nthis gonna be the hard part.\n\n142\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.010\nAll right, so all of my\napplications are closed right now.\n\n143\n00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.830\nAnd I'm gonna log out.\n\n144\n00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.330\nAnd so when I logout see how it's saying\nreopen windows when logging back and\n\n145\n00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.440\nI'm gonna turn that off, right.\n\n146\n00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.410\nI don't want it to reopen any windows I\nwanna make sure that anything I see is\n\n147\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.660\nactually coming from a login item.\n\n148\n00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.250\nAnd so I'm gonna logout and\nI'll just log back in as me.\n\n149\n00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.750\nSo this is login window right here and\nthe login window process is launching\n\n150\n00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.910\nmy desktop and it's also looking at my\nstartup items and there's my calculator.\n\n151\n00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.020\nSo it fired up the calculator.\n\n152\n00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.520\nAnd while I don't see a window for\nit, it did fire up Safari.\n\n153\n00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.580\nSee how Safari has a little\nblack dot on the bottom?\n\n154\n00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.890\nThat tells you that Safari is\nrunning in the background.\n\n155\n00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.740\nIf I flip to it, it's running,\nit just didn't open a page for\n\n156\n00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.220\nme, and when I click on it,\nit'll launch that first page.\n\n157\n00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.044\nSo, Safari was running, and\nthe calculator was running, so\n\n158\n00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:00.304\nI could see it right there.\n\n159\n00:08:00.304 --> 00:08:02.437\nIf one of them was causing my problem,\n\n160\n00:08:02.437 --> 00:08:05.850\nmaybe that's what was freezing\nme from being able to get in.\n\n161\n00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.964\nWe can use safe mode to fix that.\n\n162\n00:08:07.964 --> 00:08:09.247\nI'm gonna quit those applications.\n\n163\n00:08:09.247 --> 00:08:12.000\nSo, I quit out a calculator,\nit's no longer in my doc.\n\n164\n00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.730\nI quit out a Safari,\nit no longer has a black dot, right?.\n\n165\n00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.140\nSo, they're both closed and\nI'm gonna log back out.\n\n166\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.960\nTo use safe mode is really easy.\n\n167\n00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.650\nAll you do is, at the login Window\nyou to type in your password and\n\n168\n00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.700\nthen you hold down the shift\nkey on your keyboard.\n\n169\n00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.230\nIf you hold shift while you\nclick that arrow to log in,\n\n170\n00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:37.890\nholding that shift key tells the system,\nhey, don't run my log in items.\n\n171\n00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:43.310\nAnd so now I get in here, I get to my desk\ntop, and notice Safari, no black dot.\n\n172\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.710\nAnd calculator, it's not in my dock.\n\n173\n00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.150\nCalculator didn't run.\n\n174\n00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.060\nIt launched, but\nit didn't use my launch items.\n\n175\n00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.740\nAnd that's nice because now,\nI can go into my system preferences, and\n\n176\n00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.050\nI can go into my users and\ngroups, I can find my account,\n\n177\n00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.760\nI can go to log in items,\nand they're still there.\n\n178\n00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.110\nAnd I can remove them if they're\nwhat's causing the problem.\n\n179\n00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.180\nAnd I can get it out of there.\n\n180\n00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.990\nAll right, so the secret that was\nholding shift, while logging in.\n\n181\n00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:13.540\nSafe Mode is all about troubleshooting\nthese guys, these login items, okay?.\n\n182\n00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.180\nHold Shift while logging in.\n\n183\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.090\nNow, I do want to throw in a caveat.\n\n184\n00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.260\nIn El Capitan, these are our login items,\nand these are fired up by the launcher\n\n185\n00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.511\ndaemon in the background on our behalf\nto get them up and running, all right.\n\n186\n00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.750\nIn older versions of Mac OS,\n\n187\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.280\nyou had a different system\nthere called Launch Actions.\n\n188\n00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.540\nI'm sorry, Launch Agents.\n\n189\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.850\nThere we go, Launch Agents.\n\n190\n00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.850\nAnd what Launch Agents did is they\nwere actually stored on the hard drive\n\n191\n00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.640\nin particular folders.\n\n192\n00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.490\nAnd when your system boots up\nthey would run these agents.\n\n193\n00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.090\nNow, the support for\nthe Launch Agents is still there.\n\n194\n00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.820\nWe're backwards compatible.\n\n195\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.640\nBut Apple has told developers\nthat if they use Launch Agents,\n\n196\n00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.390\nthey can't have their\napp in the App Store.\n\n197\n00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.540\nSo, almost every developers\nmove away from them and\n\n198\n00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.800\nyou don't really see\nLaunch Agents anymore.\n\n199\n00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.680\nBut if you've upgraded your system through\nseveral different versions in Mac OS,\n\n200\n00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.220\nthen you might still have some\nLaunch Agents floating around.\n\n201\n00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.050\nAnd if that's the case, you can spot them,\nlet me jump into the terminal and\n\n202\n00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.010\nshow you where.\n\n203\n00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.710\nThere's three different\nplaces they can be,\n\n204\n00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.790\nis the case with pretty\nmuch everything this days.\n\n205\n00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.240\nThere's three different places,\nthe main place that you look for\n\n206\n00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.200\nis in your user account.\n\n207\n00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.220\nThe Launch Agents are for\nyour user, right?.\n\n208\n00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.648\nSo, you're changing your home directory.\n\n209\n00:10:17.648 --> 00:10:20.880\nI mean /Users/donpezet, right?.\n\n210\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.260\nAnd in your home directory, if you go\ninto your library folder, you may or\n\n211\n00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.640\nmay not have a folder\ncalled Launch Agents.\n\n212\n00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.280\nAnd when I look,\nI don't even have the folder,\n\n213\n00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.360\nso, there's no folder in\nhere called Launch Agents.\n\n214\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.830\nI don't have any Launch Agents.\n\n215\n00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.480\nBut if there was a folder\ncalled Launch Agents,\n\n216\n00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.490\nanything in it would\nlaunch when I logged in.\n\n217\n00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.708\nThat's that legacy system.\n\n218\n00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:39.960\nThere's also system-wide ones.\n\n219\n00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:47.930\nIf we go into /System /Library that\nyou may have Launch Agents in here,\n\n220\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.820\nand see how I've still got that\nfolder in here under System?\n\n221\n00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.180\nIf I change into it and\n\n222\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.630\ntake a look around,\nit should be all Apple stuff, right?\n\n223\n00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.240\nSo, when I look in here,\nthese are all com.apple?\n\n224\n00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.120\nYou shouldn't see any third\nparty systems in here.\n\n225\n00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.380\nThese Launch Agents are all Apple.\n\n226\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.340\nAll for when my system boots up and\nmaking that hardware work, all right?.\n\n227\n00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.140\nThird parties are not supposed\nto write to that anymore.\n\n228\n00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.020\nAnd then there's one other place which is\n/library and this is where third parties\n\n229\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:21.030\nwere supposed to write to in the first\nplace, your just /Library/LaunchAgents.\n\n230\n00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:25.880\nAnd in here, you may have some, but again,\n\n231\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.320\nthe developers should have moved\ntheir applications out of that.\n\n232\n00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.250\nSo these are three places where there's\nother services that might run when\n\n233\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.770\nyour system boots up,\nif they're there and they may exist.\n\n234\n00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.230\nSo I just wanted to point that out.\n\n235\n00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.300\nThat one in your user account's\nthe important one for the exam.\n\n236\n00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.660\nThat's where your legacy\nstuff might be and\n\n237\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.680\nyou can just delete files out of that and\nthey won't launch anymore.\n\n238\n00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:47.200\nAll right, now that's good, if the lockup\nhappens after the login window.\n\n239\n00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.140\nBut, what if the lockup happens\nbefore the login window?\n\n240\n00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.088\nWell, anything that happens before\nthe login window is a service.\n\n241\n00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:56.290\nIt's something that runs in the\nbackground, and it's normally being run\n\n242\n00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:01.650\neither as a manually defined service,\nor as a kernel extension, a kext file.\n\n243\n00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.150\nThose kernel extensions,\nthey all run at boot time too.\n\n244\n00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.860\nAnd so, I can tell the system, hey,\n\n245\n00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.960\nwhen you boot up,\ndon't load anything extra special.\n\n246\n00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.420\nJust load the core operating system.\n\n247\n00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.330\nDon't load any third-party\nkernel extensions.\n\n248\n00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.200\nDon't load any third-party applications,\nor services.\n\n249\n00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.810\nAll right, that's called, safe boot.\n\n250\n00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.260\nSafe mode, that's just you,\nyour user account when you log in.\n\n251\n00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.030\nYou hold shift while logging in.\n\n252\n00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.610\nSafe boot, we actually have\nto hold shift while we boot.\n\n253\n00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.630\nAnd so when you power on your system,\n\n254\n00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.480\nyou need to start holding shift\nbefore that Apple logo shows up.\n\n255\n00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.750\nAnd if you do that,\nit flushes the startup cache and\n\n256\n00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.510\nit doesn't load third-party\nkernel extensions and so on.\n\n257\n00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.750\nSo if I take this system here and\nshut it down.\n\n258\n00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.740\nSo, I'll just shut down this one and\npower that off.\n\n259\n00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:51.300\nAnd then when I power it on,\nI'm gonna hold shift on my keyboard and\n\n260\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.480\nlet's see if there will\nactually just powered off.\n\n261\n00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.630\nAnd so, I'll hold shift on my keyboard and\n\n262\n00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:00.100\nnow it's gonna boot up kind of what\nwill seem like a normal process, right?.\n\n263\n00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.250\nSo it's gonna boot and\nstart to go through its routine but\n\n264\n00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:06.860\nit's only loading core services,\nthe basic operating system, right?.\n\n265\n00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.660\nAny third-party stuff is being\nleft out and that's it, all right.\n\n266\n00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.310\nSo, when this boots up,\nnow if it's third-party\n\n267\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.690\nsoftware that's causing the problem,\nI can rule that out, right?.\n\n268\n00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.320\nIf the problem still exists,\nthen it's a problem with my OS.\n\n269\n00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.860\nBut if the problem is gone,\nI know it's third party software.\n\n270\n00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.040\nGreat way to do a process\nof elimination on that,\n\n271\n00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.810\ncuz all this stuff's hidden\nfrom our view anyway.\n\n272\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:26.910\nThis is all we can see.\n\n273\n00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.370\nNow, I don't really get any visual\nconfirmation that I'm booting in safe\n\n274\n00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:35.090\nboot, but I know that when it comes up,\nmy third party drivers will be missing.\n\n275\n00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.440\nSo I might have like a network\nadaptor that doesn't work, or\n\n276\n00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.110\nprinter that doesn't work or\nsomething like that.\n\n277\n00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.600\nAnd it'll be because that wasn't\nloaded when we booted up.\n\n278\n00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.930\nI was holding shift while I boot it.\n\n279\n00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.880\nAll right, so safe mode versus safe boot.\n\n280\n00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.300\nSafe boot, that's the launchd stuff.\n\n281\n00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.790\nSafe mode,\nthat's the login Windows stuff, right?\n\n282\n00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.720\nTwo different angles there.\n\n283\n00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.650\nOne other thing I'll mention while\nI'm waiting on this system to boot.\n\n284\n00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.790\nSome of you guys might have heard of PRAM,\nall right?\n\n285\n00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:05.730\nPRAM is Parameter Random Access Memory,\nPRAM.\n\n286\n00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.130\nWhen you boot up your system,\nall the kernel extensions that you have,\n\n287\n00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.590\nthe fact that they exist gets put in\na little cache on your motherboard.\n\n288\n00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.620\nThe settings, the parameters for that\nhardware, like what hard drives you have\n\n289\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.460\nor what display resolution you're using,\nthat kind of stuff,\n\n290\n00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.880\ngets stored in this special cache so\nthe system can access it very quickly.\n\n291\n00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.330\nWell, if you're having flaky hardware,\nif things are starting to act up and\n\n292\n00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.200\nnot work right, well, then,\nwe might have a bigger problem.\n\n293\n00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.890\nWe might have a problem with that cache.\n\n294\n00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.700\nAnd so, you might need to flush it.\n\n295\n00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.080\nDoing a safe boot doesn't\nactually flush that cache.\n\n296\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.820\nIt still has some of that\ninformation cached in there.\n\n297\n00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.100\nSo, if we ever need to flush that,\nthen we might need to reset our PRAM.\n\n298\n00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.600\nNow, you'll notice my\nsystem is booting up.\n\n299\n00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.880\nAnd did you guys see that screen flicker?\n\n300\n00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.040\nWell, that's because it's loading\nthe basic video card driver.\n\n301\n00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.840\nIt's not loading the normal one, so\nit's not handling the memory right.\n\n302\n00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.940\nAnd, what's worse, or what's worse for\nme, is that my Touchpad isn't working.\n\n303\n00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.230\nMy Magic Pad, the Bluetooth\ndrivers haven't kicked in yet, so\n\n304\n00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.410\nit's kinda going a little sluggish here,\nbecause I did safe boot.\n\n305\n00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.750\nIt's missing some of the key\nstuff that I would normally have.\n\n306\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.200\nAll right.\n\n307\n00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.220\nNow, back to the PRAM.\n\n308\n00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.670\nThe parameters for a lot of this stuff,\nlike my monitor resolution,\n\n309\n00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.530\nthey're being stored in PRAM.\n\n310\n00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.450\nAnd if I ever do something\nlike change out a monitor, and\n\n311\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.810\nI can't boot my computer now,\ncuz I can't see?\n\n312\n00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.910\nYou can flush the PRAM and\nthat'll help you get around that.\n\n313\n00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.890\nYou hopefully don't have to do it but\nsome people do from time to time,\n\n314\n00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:33.270\nhave to flush the PRAM and it's kind of\none of those last resort type things.\n\n315\n00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.490\nYou don't want to do it unless\nyou absolutely have to.\n\n316\n00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.920\nThere, my touchpad\nfinally started working.\n\n317\n00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.480\nSo if you do need to flush the PRAM,\nwhat you do is you power off your Mac.\n\n318\n00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.720\nAnd the key combination for\nthis one is kind of hard.\n\n319\n00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:50.800\nWhat you have to do is hit\nCommand Option P and R, okay?\n\n320\n00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.090\nCommand and Option we've seen a number\nof times, and then P and R for PRAM.\n\n321\n00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.430\nThat's how you can remember it.\n\n322\n00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:00.074\nSo I'm gonna hold Command Option P and R.\n\n323\n00:16:00.074 --> 00:16:03.675\nAnd I'm gonna try and do that with one\nhand cuz I need to reach over here and\n\n324\n00:16:03.675 --> 00:16:05.758\nhit my power button to turn the system on.\n\n325\n00:16:05.758 --> 00:16:08.775\nNow when you power it on\nholding command option P and\n\n326\n00:16:08.775 --> 00:16:13.614\nR The system is going to boot up, and you\nprobably won't hear it in my microphone,\n\n327\n00:16:13.614 --> 00:16:15.810\nbut your Mac will make the Mac noise.\n\n328\n00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:19.770\nYou know the little dong and\nthen, it will reboot.\n\n329\n00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:24.480\nAnd Apple recommends that you continue\nto hold the Command Option P and R.\n\n330\n00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.870\nSo, that it does it a second time and\nit'll go dong and then it'll reboot and\n\n331\n00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:28.850\nthen you'll let go.\n\n332\n00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.160\nThey always recommend\nflushing the P RAM twice and\n\n333\n00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.140\nthat's just because it's designed\nto be resilient, to retain data.\n\n334\n00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.430\nSo making sure you flush it twice,\nmake sure that it's completely empty.\n\n335\n00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:42.880\nAnd when the system boots up, it'll\nnow reindex all the kernel extensions.\n\n336\n00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.066\nAnd make sure it's only using ones that\nare actually present on the drive.\n\n337\n00:16:45.066 --> 00:16:46.770\nAnd it's going to boot up and\ndo that, I know,\n\n338\n00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.295\nwatching my screen here's\nnot very exciting.\n\n339\n00:16:48.295 --> 00:16:51.230\nBecause when you flush Prem,\nguess what you see on the screen?\n\n340\n00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.930\nAbsolutely nothing,\nyou don't see anything and\n\n341\n00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.310\nthat's because it's flushing even\nthe video card's kernel extensions.\n\n342\n00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.931\nAnd so, we just sit here and\nlook at a black screen and\n\n343\n00:17:00.931 --> 00:17:04.638\nit did actually reset right there, but\nyou have to listen for that [SOUND].\n\n344\n00:17:04.638 --> 00:17:05.699\nI know you guys can't,\n\n345\n00:17:05.699 --> 00:17:08.628\n[SOUND], I guess if I would shut\nup you can hear it right there.\n\n346\n00:17:08.628 --> 00:17:12.694\nSo there it did it, and I get the Apple\nlogo, and now it's going to boot and\n\n347\n00:17:12.694 --> 00:17:16.720\nI've reset that, my p ram and\nnow, it's going to come up.\n\n348\n00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.970\nIf I'm dealing with a kernel extension and\nI boot it into single user mode and\n\n349\n00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.650\ndeleted the kernel extension.\n\n350\n00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.400\nThen, I might need to flush the PRAM to\nmake sure the system knows that happened.\n\n351\n00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.640\nSo that's another one,\nit's not one that I use a lot.\n\n352\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.050\nIt's one that hopefully\nyou don't have to use but\n\n353\n00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.010\nit is out there and it's available.\n\n354\n00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.760\nAll right, so let's see,\n\n355\n00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.450\nwe've talked about safe mode,\nwe talked about safe boot.\n\n356\n00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.330\nWe talked about flushing the PRAM,\n\n357\n00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.070\nall different troubleshooting\ntools that we've got available.\n\n358\n00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.370\nWhat else have I not talked about?\n\n359\n00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.100\nRecovery, let's talk about\nrecovery a little bit.\n\n360\n00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.540\nRecovery is tricky, because it used to be,\nthat every Mac that you bought\n\n361\n00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.760\nhad the recovery partition\nright there on the hard drive.\n\n362\n00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.330\nBut, a lot of the newer Macs,\nactually don't have it,\n\n363\n00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.170\nthey've stopped putting the recovery\npatrician on the hard drive.\n\n364\n00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.030\nAnd, why did they do that?\n\n365\n00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.650\nWell, the recovery patrician ate up\na few hundred megabytes of data and\n\n366\n00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:07.900\non some of the newer systems.\n\n367\n00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:12.360\nWhere they have 128 gig SSD, people want\nas much of that room as they can get.\n\n368\n00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.440\nAnd so, Apple said, all right, well, fine,\n\n369\n00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:19.950\nwe'll just start leaving that off and\nyou can use Internet Recovery instead.\n\n370\n00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.950\nSo if we ever need to use Recovery,\nthere's three ways to boot it.\n\n371\n00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.120\nOne, you can boot it off\nthe hard drive itself.\n\n372\n00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.300\nAnd that's usually the fastest, but\n\n373\n00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.550\nif your hard drive is the problem\nit's not going to work.\n\n374\n00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.190\nSo, it's the fastest but\nnot the most reliable.\n\n375\n00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.550\nThe second option is, to use internet\nrecovery, internet recovery,\n\n376\n00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.520\nwe boot up and\nit downloads recovery from Apple.\n\n377\n00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.800\nIt's the slowest,\n\n378\n00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.580\nit takes a long time and it assumes\nthat you have an internet connection.\n\n379\n00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.310\nWhat if I don't have\nan internet connection?\n\n380\n00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:52.580\nIf I don't have an internet connection\nthen I can't use internet recovery, can I?\n\n381\n00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.310\nAnd so that leads us to option number\nthree and option number three is,\n\n382\n00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.240\nif you have a USB install media.\n\n383\n00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.370\nWay back in episode one or two,\nwe made a USB install media for\n\n384\n00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.030\nel capitan, you can boot off of that.\n\n385\n00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.140\nAnd its got recovery\nthat's a part of it and\n\n386\n00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.760\nI guess,\nI should do an option number four.\n\n387\n00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.220\nNumber four would be, if I boot up,\nfrom a time machine disk,\n\n388\n00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:18.170\ntime machine disks actually have,\nthe, the recovery on them.\n\n389\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.050\nSo you can do it off your time\nmachine disk and can go that way,\n\n390\n00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.130\nit's great if you have\na completely blank system.\n\n391\n00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.250\nLet's go back to my Mac Mini for a second,\nbecause it's doing something interesting.\n\n392\n00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.950\nI flushed my P ram, and\nnow that I've booted, what do I get?\n\n393\n00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.950\nIt's asking me what language I speak.\n\n394\n00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.330\nWhat's that all about?\n\n395\n00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.420\nWell, it's asking me because it doesn't\nknow anymore that was stored in PRAM.\n\n396\n00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.810\nNow, don't panic, crap,\nall my data's gone, it's fresh install.\n\n397\n00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.830\nIt's not a fresh install,\nwe just cleared out those settings.\n\n398\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.000\nSo, I have to tell my main language and\n\n399\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.300\nmove forward on the wizard here just\nlike I was doing a new install.\n\n400\n00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.980\nBut, it's got my basic system on there and\nactually, mine did boot into recovery for\n\n401\n00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.290\nsome reason.\n\n402\n00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.072\nWonder why it did that?\n\n403\n00:19:56.072 --> 00:20:00.460\nAll right, well so, I booted a recovery,\nso maybe I wasn't holding,\n\n404\n00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.860\nI was trying to do command option P and R.\n\n405\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.570\nAnd I might have not hit\nthe P hard enough, so\n\n406\n00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.510\nit might have been command option R and\ntaken me into internet recovery here, so.\n\n407\n00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.770\nAnyhow, I ended up in recovery but\nonce we're in recovery, you know,\n\n408\n00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.790\nhere's where we can go in and\nstart to recover our systems.\n\n409\n00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.860\nTalking about recovery anyway, so\n\n410\n00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.690\nwe want to be able to get to this\nbecause the tools that are inside of it.\n\n411\n00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.030\nAnd I know in another episode,\nwe walk through all the different tools,\n\n412\n00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.770\nwe talk about the disk utility.\n\n413\n00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.650\nAnd we talk about the terminal,and\nthe firmware password and\n\n414\n00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.350\nall those other bells and whistles.\n\n415\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:35.410\nBut getting into recovery is important,\nit is usually your go to guy for\n\n416\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:36.700\nhard drive problems.\n\n417\n00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.110\nAnd the hard drive, honestly, is the most\nlikely piece to fail inside of your Mac,\n\n418\n00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.450\nit's really rare for RAM chips to fail.\n\n419\n00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.310\nIt's really rare for CPU's and\nmotherboards to fail, it happens, but\n\n420\n00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:47.610\nit's really rare.\n\n421\n00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.850\nAnd if that happens,\nthe hardware diagnostic will turn it on,\n\n422\n00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.430\nboot it up holding d,\nrun the hardware diagnostics.\n\n423\n00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:55.450\nRight but\nhard drives they fail all the time.\n\n424\n00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.820\nSSDs are more reliable than spinning\ndisk with spinning disk fail\n\n425\n00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.840\nit's rare to get a spinning disk\nthat loose more than three years.\n\n426\n00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.080\nSome people have it happen but usually,\n\n427\n00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.990\nthree years is the expected\nlifetime of a spinning disk.\n\n428\n00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.910\nSSD the lifetime is only four or\n\n429\n00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.190\nfive years,\nnot because the disk's hardware fails.\n\n430\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:15.030\nBut because the flash memory can\nonly be written to so many times and\n\n431\n00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.110\nif you're right to it too many times,\nit wears out.\n\n432\n00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.240\nAnd so it starts to break down, so\n\n433\n00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.270\nyou really only get four to\nfive years out of an SSD.\n\n434\n00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:24.710\nIf you've got a Mac that's over\nfive years old, the odds are,\n\n435\n00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.650\nyour storage is a ticking time bomb.\n\n436\n00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.830\nAnd so, when your storage does fail,\nyou bring in new storage,\n\n437\n00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.470\nyou bring in a blank hard drive.\n\n438\n00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:34.710\nAnd you'll need to boot to recovery to\nbe able to get that hard drive ready and\n\n439\n00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:35.650\ninstall the operating system.\n\n440\n00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:39.990\nOr boot from installable media,\nthen you can reinstall your OS.\n\n441\n00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.300\nJust be aware, that not every system\nhas recovery built into it anymore.\n\n442\n00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.920\nIt's not always on the hard drive and\nif it's not on the hard drive,\n\n443\n00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.760\nwell then you'll need to\nthe internet recovery.\n\n444\n00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.300\nHow do I know if a system\nhas recovery on it, right?\n\n445\n00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.290\nThere's a few ways, let me show you\nthe easiest ways in my opinion,\n\n446\n00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:56.420\nlet me shut this machine down.\n\n447\n00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:01.570\nWhen you boot up your system,\nyou can hold the option key or\n\n448\n00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.480\nalternate key depending on your keyboard.\n\n449\n00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.070\nBut you can hold the option key, and\n\n450\n00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:09.330\nwhen you boot holding the option key,\nit brings up the boot menu.\n\n451\n00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:14.370\nAnd the boot menu will show you\nyour available bootable options.\n\n452\n00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.610\nIf you've got a recovery\npartition on your hard drive,\n\n453\n00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.790\nyou'll see it show up here any minute now.\n\n454\n00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.680\nThere, was getting nervous for\na second there.\n\n455\n00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.990\nIt's going to be a little small\nbecause the video card drivers\n\n456\n00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.660\nhaven't fully loaded.\n\n457\n00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.390\nSo, I can't get the bigger resolution, but\n\n458\n00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:30.205\nI see two options Macintosh HD,\nand Recovery 10.11.3.\n\n459\n00:22:30.205 --> 00:22:32.740\nNow that's an interesting\none because it's 10.11,\n\n460\n00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.820\nthis Mac Mini actually shipped with\nYosemite, it shipped with 10.10.\n\n461\n00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:42.560\nBut I upgraded to El Capitan and when I\ndid that it, it upgraded Recovery also.\n\n462\n00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.040\nThe recovery partition will\nget upgraded if it's present,\n\n463\n00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.340\nif it's not present obviously that's\nnot going to happen, all right.\n\n464\n00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.180\nSo, if I were to boot Recovery here,\nI'm going to boot,\n\n465\n00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.480\nit's going to go to Recovery and\nnow, I'm loading up that Recovery.\n\n466\n00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.990\nSo that's the easiest way to\nsee if you have Recovery,\n\n467\n00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:59.390\nis just hold option when you boot,\nand you'll see it in the list.\n\n468\n00:23:00.395 --> 00:23:03.485\nAnother option is,\nyou won't see the disk utility.\n\n469\n00:23:03.485 --> 00:23:07.255\nBut you can go to the command line and\nrun diskutil-l and\n\n470\n00:23:07.255 --> 00:23:11.125\nit'll list all your partitions and you'll\nsee the recovery partition on there too.\n\n471\n00:23:11.125 --> 00:23:15.870\nThe command line when shows that he\ngraphical one doesn't, if I can, well,\n\n472\n00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.960\nit's going to boot to recovery now.\n\n473\n00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.330\nWhen it gets into recovery, I can use the\nterminal and show you guys what I mean.\n\n474\n00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.400\nNow, if the recovery is not there,\nI'm not out of luck,\n\n475\n00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.680\nI can still use internet recovery.\n\n476\n00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.590\nI can boot holding command option R,\n\n477\n00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.420\ncommand option R will tell it's using\nthe recovery to reach out to Apple.\n\n478\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.230\nAnd it will download recovery but\n\n479\n00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:37.550\nit's going to download the recovery\nthat's shipped with the unit.\n\n480\n00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.970\nSo on my hard drive,\nI've got Yosemite, I mean El Capitan,\n\n481\n00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.850\nbecause I upgraded to El Capitan,\nthat's what I've got right here.\n\n482\n00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:47.470\nBut if I do Internet recovery,\nApple looks at my serial number and\n\n483\n00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.506\nthey say this shipped with Yosemite.\n\n484\n00:23:49.506 --> 00:23:53.440\nSo I'm going to give you\nYosemite's recovery, and\n\n485\n00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.980\nthat's not normally a big deal.\n\n486\n00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.614\nIf you're just running disk utility or\nsomething, it's not a big deal.\n\n487\n00:23:58.614 --> 00:24:03.452\nBut if you're running an older Mac,\nright, so if you maybe you bought\n\n488\n00:24:03.452 --> 00:24:08.538\nyour Mac Eight years ago, and\nyou've upgraded all the way to El Capitan.\n\n489\n00:24:08.538 --> 00:24:12.460\nRight, they support all the way back to\n2009 right now so that's seven years.\n\n490\n00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:16.330\nYou might have shipped with a version of\n\n491\n00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:19.180\nMac OS that doesn't support\nsomething like FileVault 2.\n\n492\n00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.780\nAnd so if you're running FileVault\n2 to encrypt your hard drive,\n\n493\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.200\nthe recovery you boot is not\ngonna work very well, is it?\n\n494\n00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.510\nAnd that's gonna cause a problem.\n\n495\n00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.600\nSo that's where you need to have that\nremovable media where you can boot\n\n496\n00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.740\noff of the newer recovery or\nhave recovery on the drive itself.\n\n497\n00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.380\nAll right, this system is running slow.\n\n498\n00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.790\nEventually, it's gonna\nboot into recovery so\n\n499\n00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.085\nI can show you guys that command\nline I just wanted to show you.\n\n500\n00:24:39.085 --> 00:24:42.845\nIt's discutil-l,\njust lists all the drives.\n\n501\n00:24:42.845 --> 00:24:45.485\nAnd you'll see your EFI partition and\nyou'll see recovery, and\n\n502\n00:24:45.485 --> 00:24:46.595\nyou'll see your Mcintosh HD.\n\n503\n00:24:46.595 --> 00:24:48.455\nYou should see those three things.\n\n504\n00:24:48.455 --> 00:24:49.765\nThere we go, all right.\n\n505\n00:24:49.765 --> 00:24:54.935\nSo here I am getting into recovery and\neventually I'll get in there, there we go.\n\n506\n00:24:54.935 --> 00:24:56.465\nAnd I'll go into my terminal.\n\n507\n00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:01.890\nAnd let me make this,\nwell, as soon it comes up,\n\n508\n00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:02.970\nI'll make the font a little bigger.\n\n509\n00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.190\nAnd then we'll run that diskutil.\n\n510\n00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:09.074\nSo, there we go, diskutil-l.\n\n511\n00:25:09.074 --> 00:25:11.174\nAnd, whoops, is it not?\n\n512\n00:25:14.078 --> 00:25:16.020\nI thought it was -l, is it just list?\n\n513\n00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.830\nIt is, it's just list, all right,\nwell apparently if I get my command right,\n\n514\n00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:20.410\nthere we go, diskutil list.\n\n515\n00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.200\nAll right so now when I look,\nit's showing me the disks in my system and\n\n516\n00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.510\nI'm gonna see a lot of\ninteresting things here.\n\n517\n00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:34.060\nBecause it is in recovery so it's got\nthese virtual drives that it's created.\n\n518\n00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.510\nWhen you run recovery,\nit's running a lot of stuff from RAM.\n\n519\n00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.390\nBut when I look in here, I'll find\nthe real disk way up here at the top.\n\n520\n00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:43.480\nSo here's my real disk, and\nthere's the three partitions I mentioned.\n\n521\n00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.618\nEFI, which will usually be about\na 200 Meg driver, very small.\n\n522\n00:25:46.618 --> 00:25:51.490\nAnd then I've got Apple_HFS Macintosh HD,\nright, so it's the Apple format for\n\n523\n00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.430\nmy Macintosh hard drive.\n\n524\n00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.450\nAnd then I've got Recovery HD right there,\nright, so\n\n525\n00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.450\nI've got that recovery right on the drive.\n\n526\n00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.037\nIf I don't see that,\nmy system doesn't have built-in recovery,\n\n527\n00:26:01.037 --> 00:26:02.960\nI'm gonna have to use Internet recovery.\n\n528\n00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.130\nAnd Internet recovery is\nnot really a big deal.\n\n529\n00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.120\nif you boot your system and\n\n530\n00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.730\nit doesn't have a recovery partition, even\nif you're holding Cmd+R it'll actually\n\n531\n00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.090\nflip to use Internet recovery cuz it\nknows there's no recovery partition.\n\n532\n00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:17.770\nBut if I wanna force it to use Internet\nrecovery, it's just Cmd+Option+R.\n\n533\n00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:21.320\nSo if I shut the system down again,\nthere it goes.\n\n534\n00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.148\nThis time I'll boot it\nholding Cmd+Option+R.\n\n535\n00:26:24.148 --> 00:26:26.530\nSo I'm gonna hold Cmd+Option+R\nwhile that boots up.\n\n536\n00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:32.090\nAnd now it's going to boot, and\nwhat it should do is see that I'm holding\n\n537\n00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.880\nOption and along with Cmd and R,\nand boot to Internet recovery.\n\n538\n00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.020\nYou'll know it works if you see a globe.\n\n539\n00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.882\nInstead of an apple I get a globe and\nit's asking me to pick a network to use.\n\n540\n00:26:41.882 --> 00:26:44.546\nAnd so I can come in here, if I was\nphysically plugged in it would have used\n\n541\n00:26:44.546 --> 00:26:47.650\nthat but I'm not, so\nI've gotta pick a wireless network.\n\n542\n00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:50.350\nAnd I've gotta tell it the password for\nthat wireless network.\n\n543\n00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:55.172\nAnd assuming I get it right,\nit'll connect to that wireless network.\n\n544\n00:26:55.172 --> 00:26:55.920\nAnd it'll reach out to Apple,\n\n545\n00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.960\nand it'll start downloading about 700 Megs\nof data to get that recovery in place.\n\n546\n00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:03.276\nSo there it goes, it's downloading, and\nit can take four or five minutes for\n\n547\n00:27:03.276 --> 00:27:04.253\nit to do this process.\n\n548\n00:27:04.253 --> 00:27:06.670\nWe're not gonna wait for\nit to finish, but it can do that.\n\n549\n00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.210\nAnd then you're in to recovery, all right.\n\n550\n00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.570\nSo the key thing to remember\nout of all of this is boy,\n\n551\n00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.370\ndo you have a lot of tools, right?\n\n552\n00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:18.430\nYou've got safe mode, safe boot,\nyou've got the log in items\n\n553\n00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.730\nsystem preference that you\ncan use on your user account.\n\n554\n00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:23.709\nYou've got regular recovery,\nyou've got Internet recovery,\n\n555\n00:27:23.709 --> 00:27:26.048\nrecovery from Time Machine or\nas installed media.\n\n556\n00:27:26.048 --> 00:27:30.092\nYou've got the hardware diagnostics\nduring boot, you've got single user mode,\n\n557\n00:27:30.092 --> 00:27:31.455\nverbose mode for booting.\n\n558\n00:27:31.455 --> 00:27:36.140\nYou've got flashing your PRAM,\nall of these different tools that\n\n559\n00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:40.850\nare designed to help us depending on which\nstage of the boot process we can get to.\n\n560\n00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:42.070\nAnd remember that boot process, right?\n\n561\n00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.520\nYou power it on, the firmware kicks in.\n\n562\n00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:50.165\nFirmware turns on EFI, EFI launches\nthe booter, booter launches launchd.\n\n563\n00:27:50.165 --> 00:27:52.550\nLaunchd starts to launch\nyour other services, and\n\n564\n00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.580\nit launches the log in window.\n\n565\n00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.840\nThe log in window, lets you log in and\nthen launches your log in items.\n\n566\n00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.860\nAnd then your Mac is up and running.\n\n567\n00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.290\nAnd depending on where you fail,\ndifferent tools are available.\n\n568\n00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.860\nSo if your hardware isn't working,\nyou can't get to recovery.\n\n569\n00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:12.130\nYou can't get to safe boot or safe mode,\nbut you can get to hardware diagnostics.\n\n570\n00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:16.640\nIf you can't log in, you can still do safe\nboot, or you can do safe mode and try and\n\n571\n00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.700\nfigure out what's going on there,\nor you can boot to recovery.\n\n572\n00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.820\nYou may have all the tools\nat your disposal.\n\n573\n00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.060\nThe trick is just making sure you\nuse the right tool for the job,\n\n574\n00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.360\nthat you use whatever's available, to get\nin there and try and repair that system.\n\n575\n00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.260\nAll right, so that's a pretty\ngood rundown of all the different\n\n576\n00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:31.000\nstuff that's available.\n\n577\n00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:31.850\nI know it's a lot.\n\n578\n00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.160\nThe show notes for\nthis episode will be really valuable,\n\n579\n00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.170\nI'll put in all the keyboard shortcuts and\nstuff.\n\n580\n00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:37.690\nThey're actually all right here anyway.\n\n581\n00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:40.460\nSo that'll be available on the website,\ndefinitely check that out.\n\n582\n00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.550\nOtherwise, hopefully you made good\nnotes cuz we talked about a lot of\n\n583\n00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:43.685\ndifferent options.\n\n584\n00:28:43.685 --> 00:28:45.460\nAnd I was showing it all on Mac Mini.\n\n585\n00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:51.070\nBut it's exactly the same on a MacBook,\non a MacPro, on an iMac.\n\n586\n00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.850\nIt's all the same stuff, all the same\ncommands, it all works the same way.\n\n587\n00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.890\nThat's the nice part about Apple\necosystem is they keep it consistent.\n\n588\n00:28:58.032 --> 00:28:59.650\nAll right, well that's about it for\nthis show.\n\n589\n00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.140\nWe'll go ahead and\nwrap up troubleshooting here.\n\n590\n00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.000\nI hope you guys it enjoyed it.\n\n591\n00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.540\nAnd that really wraps up the ACSP content.\n\n592\n00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.380\nThis is our last episode,\nour last objective.\n\n593\n00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.363\nSo unless anything new and\n\n594\n00:29:08.363 --> 00:29:11.006\nexciting comes out this will probably\nbe the last ACSP episode for us.\n\n595\n00:29:11.006 --> 00:29:13.592\nSo for all of you that watched\nthe entire series, thanks for\n\n596\n00:29:13.592 --> 00:29:14.790\nsticking in there
