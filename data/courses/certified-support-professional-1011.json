at\nthe Apple Certified Support Professional\n\n4\n00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:15.920\ncertification show, here on ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.970\nNow the ACSP's been around for awhile,\nwe've actually filmed it a few times.\n\n6\n00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.990\nThis time we're doing an update to\nthe El Capitan operating system release.\n\n7\n00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.870\nWith each new version of Mac OS,\nwe get changes, changes to the UI,\n\n8\n00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.160\nchanges to the software.\n\n9\n00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.860\nAnd we update to refresh and reflect\nthat in our certification training.\n\n10\n00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.457\nSo that's what we're doing right here.\n\n11\n00:00:33.457 --> 00:00:37.497\nIf you want to learn all about supporting\nEl Capitan out there in the real world,\n\n12\n00:00:37.497 --> 00:00:41.008\nif you're trying to support OS 10.11,\nthis is where it's at.\n\n13\n00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.320\nNow, there's a lot of overlap\nwith previous versions.\n\n14\n00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.080\nIf you're already certified\nin a previous version,\n\n15\n00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.250\nyou'll find that this is mostly the same.\n\n16\n00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.760\nJust a handful of utilities have changed,\nand things that you may encounter.\n\n17\n00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.950\nBut on a bigger side, we have some new\nsecurity features in OS 10.11 that\n\n18\n00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.890\ncan impact how we deploy applications and\n\n19\n00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.830\nsupport the machines out\nthere in the real world.\n\n20\n00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.740\nWell, before I get ahead of myself,\nlet's start with what is the ACSP?\n\n21\n00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.400\nThe Apple Certified Support Professional\nis a certification designed for anybody\n\n22\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.630\nwho's out there supporting Macintosh\ncomputers in a business environment.\n\n23\n00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.770\nWe're not talking about home users.\n\n24\n00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.320\nYou might have one, two,\neven five Macs at home, and\n\n25\n00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.660\nthose you really just\nmanage them individually.\n\n26\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.420\nBut when you have a 100 Macs, a 1,000,\nwhen you've got MacBook laptops,\n\n27\n00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.860\nand Mac Pro desktops, and iPads, and\niPhones, and you've got all these\n\n28\n00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.910\ndifferent Apple devices, it sure would be\nnice if we had some kind of way to manage\n\n29\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.680\nthem in a network where they all play\ntogether and, well, perform nicely.\n\n30\n00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.730\nAnd then when you had problems,\nthat you knew the steps to go\n\n31\n00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.920\nthrough to troubleshoot and\nresolve those issues without having\n\n32\n00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.700\nto rush right out to the Apple Store and\nget them to fix it for you.\n\n33\n00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.620\nThat's what the ACSP is all about.\n\n34\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.700\nIf you're one of those people that's\nout there having to support Macs\n\n35\n00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.210\nin your environment,\nthis is the show for you.\n\n36\n00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.850\nNow, you might have Windows\nmachines in your environment.\n\n37\n00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.420\nYou might have just a handful of Macs, but\n\n38\n00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.590\nthere's still a lot you need to\nknow just to keep them up and\n\n39\n00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.480\nrunning and healthy, and\nthat's all stuff that we see right here.\n\n40\n00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.432\nAll right, now the ACSP,\nit covers a lot of different topics.\n\n41\n00:02:07.432 --> 00:02:10.428\nIt's a bit all over the place.\n\n42\n00:02:10.428 --> 00:02:13.910\nAnd the reason is it's part of the whole\ncertification track from Apple.\n\n43\n00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.440\nSo let me bring up Apples's Training and\nCertification page here.\n\n44\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.610\nAnd what you'll see is that they\nhave a number of certifications.\n\n45\n00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.350\nAnd at the time of this filming, some of\nthem have been updated to El Capitan,\n\n46\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.910\nsome them are still at Yosemite, so\n\n47\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.080\nyou'll see several down here\nlisted here under Yosemite.\n\n48\n00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.820\nBut on the El Capitan side,\n\n49\n00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.470\nwe've got the Apple Certified\nSupport Professional right there.\n\n50\n00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.790\nThat's the name of the certification.\n\n51\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.130\nWhen you pass the exam you get your ACSP.\n\n52\n00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.770\nThe required exam, though,\n\n53\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.239\nis actually called\nthe OS X Support Essentials 10.11 exam.\n\n54\n00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.500\nAnd that exam gets updated\nwith each release of Mac OS.\n\n55\n00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.730\nThey have to update to\nreflect the new changes.\n\n56\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.160\nSo, if you take this one exam,\nyou get this one certification, the ACSP.\n\n57\n00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.190\nNow, the ACSP is one certification map.\n\n58\n00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.800\nWell, there's actually two others.\n\n59\n00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.760\nThe ACA, or Apple Certified Associate,\nthat's considered the entry point.\n\n60\n00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.659\nSo if you're just getting started\nwith Apple certifications,\n\n61\n00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.676\nit's better to start with the ACA\nthan to jump right into the ACSP.\n\n62\n00:03:08.676 --> 00:03:12.951\nNow, they don't show it here cuz it hasn't\nbeen updated yet, but there's actually two\n\n63\n00:03:12.951 --> 00:03:16.790\nACAs right here, Mac Management Basics and\nMac Integration Basics.\n\n64\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.430\nOne of them focuses just on Macs,\nMac Management Basics.\n\n65\n00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.430\nThat one has a lot of\noverlap with the ACSP,\n\n66\n00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.720\nso that's a great place to start\nbefore going into the ACSP.\n\n67\n00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.240\nMac Integration Basics, on the other hand,\n\n68\n00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.610\nfocuses more on getting Windows\nto play nice with Mac OS.\n\n69\n00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.270\nIt's not necessarily tied\nin to what we do in ACSP.\n\n70\n00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.044\nSo if you're just starting out, I do\nrecommend doing the Mac Management Basics\n\n71\n00:03:39.044 --> 00:03:42.500\ncertification first, and\nwe've already filmed that here at ITProTV.\n\n72\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.340\nIt's in our course library,\nyou can jump right over and watch it.\n\n73\n00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.747\nAnd even though Apple hasn't updated\nit for 10.11 yet, we already have.\n\n74\n00:03:48.747 --> 00:03:49.627\nSo it's in there in 10.11.\n\n75\n00:03:49.627 --> 00:03:53.674\nI mean, you can go back and watch our 10.9\ncontent, or whatever, if you want, but\n\n76\n00:03:53.674 --> 00:03:56.460\nwe've already updated it for El Capitan.\n\n77\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.070\nNow, once you get your ACSP, you are now\nan Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n78\n00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.250\nYou've shown that you're able\nto support Macs in a network.\n\n79\n00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.440\nAnd if you wanna go the next step up,\n\n80\n00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.170\nthe next step up is\nthe Apple Certified Technical Coordinator.\n\n81\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.180\nAnd this is designed not for somebody\nwho's just supporting Macs in the field,\n\n82\n00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.290\nbut somebody who's running\nthe IT department.\n\n83\n00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.720\nYou might not be the person that's\nactually out there doing the grunt work,\n\n84\n00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.900\nbut you're the one calling\nthe shots on the bigger picture.\n\n85\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.410\nSo, designing that overall infrastructure,\nwhat solutions do I deploy?\n\n86\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.930\nThat's the ACTC.\n\n87\n00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.043\nAnd if you want to get your ACTC,\nyou have to have the ACSP first.\n\n88\n00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:36.171\nYou've gotta pass the ACSP, and\nyou've gotta pass the ACTC exam.\n\n89\n00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:41.140\nAnd once you pass both of them, then you\nget your ACTC, so you've gotta have both.\n\n90\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.427\nYou can actually skip the ACA if you want,\nyou don't have to do those.\n\n91\n00:04:44.427 --> 00:04:48.028\nIf you have been working with Macs for\nyears and you're really comfortable with\n\n92\n00:04:48.028 --> 00:04:50.943\nthem, you can start right off with\nthe ACSP and jump right in it.\n\n93\n00:04:50.943 --> 00:04:55.351\nBut if you have no experience, you\nwanna start at the ACA level first, and\n\n94\n00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:56.640\nthen jump up to ACSP.\n\n95\n00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.860\nAll right, so that's where this falls\nin the Apple certification scheme,\n\n96\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.140\nlet's talk about what's on the exam.\n\n97\n00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.770\nIt covers a lot of great content,\n\n98\n00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.626\nwhich are topics that are things that\nwe're gonna deal with in the real world.\n\n99\n00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:11.440\nAnd I've kind of made a quick list here of\nthe topics that we cover in the show, so\n\n100\n00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.750\nlet's bring that up.\n\n101\n00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.810\nWe start with Installation and\nConfiguration.\n\n102\n00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.590\nHow do you get Mac OS installed?\n\n103\n00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.730\nIf you've only worked with\nthis in a home environment,\n\n104\n00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.860\nyou know that when you buy a Mac\nit's already got Mac OS on it.\n\n105\n00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.460\nBut there's many times where you\nmight want to deploy it yourself.\n\n106\n00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.360\nYou might have 1,000 Macs that\nare out there already and\n\n107\n00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.720\nthey're all running Mavericks, and you\nneed to get them upgraded to El Capitan.\n\n108\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.650\nOr you might want to\nbuild a standard image so\n\n109\n00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.780\nthat all your machines already have\nsoftware installed when you deploy them.\n\n110\n00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.130\nWe talk about that.\n\n111\n00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.580\nThen we talk about User Accounts.\n\n112\n00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.160\nHaving individual user accounts on\neverybody's computer is fine, but when\n\n113\n00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.030\nyou've got 1,000 computers, it's tough to\nmaintain that, it's tough to manage it.\n\n114\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.960\nSo having centralized user accounts and\nspecial network type authentication\n\n115\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.960\nis a really valuable thing to have,\nso we talk about those.\n\n116\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.370\nWe talk about File Systems.\n\n117\n00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.140\nWhen it comes to storage on a Mac,\nit supports a number of different things.\n\n118\n00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:05.900\nInternal and external storage, we have\nour Apple OS X Extended Journal format.\n\n119\n00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.760\nIt's a big name.\n\n120\n00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.920\nWe have Microsoft's NTFS and FAT32 and\nall these different file systems.\n\n121\n00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.530\nAnd we talk about how they function inside\nof the Mac, and how you can use them and\n\n122\n00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.810\nsome of the little caveats involved there.\n\n123\n00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.910\nWe talk about Data Management,\njust backing up our systems,\n\n124\n00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.070\nkeeping them healthy, keeping our\ndata safe, where to store data,\n\n125\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.220\nhow permissions work on our data\nwhen it's on those file systems.\n\n126\n00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.150\nThen we talked about Applications and\nProcesses.\n\n127\n00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.170\nMac OS is great, it's really easy to use,\nbut out of the box it doesn't have a ton\n\n128\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.670\nof software in it, it's got all\nthe Apple software and that's about it.\n\n129\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.730\nSo you're likely going to have to\nsupport third party applications, and\n\n130\n00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.670\nwe talk about that.\n\n131\n00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.060\nHow to get the applications loaded, how to\nmanage them, how to troubleshoot them when\n\n132\n00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.300\nthey start eating up too much CPU or too\nmuch memory, we cover all that content.\n\n133\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.050\nThen we jump into the networking world.\n\n134\n00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.220\nHow to get our system setup to\ncommunicate on the network.\n\n135\n00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.130\nAnd on the networking side,\nwe start off really with just IP networks.\n\n136\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.150\nSo how do you get two Macs to where\nthey can even see each other?\n\n137\n00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.290\nAnd once they can see each\nother on the network,\n\n138\n00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.650\nthen we move into Network Services.\n\n139\n00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.495\nAll right, great, your two computers\nsee each other, what do you do now?\n\n140\n00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:06.399\nHow can you share files,\nhow can you share folders,\n\n141\n00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:08.650\nor printers, or even CD and DVD drives?\n\n142\n00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.840\nHow do you share any of those\nresources when two computers see each\n\n143\n00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.690\nother on the network?\n\n144\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.820\nWe cover all of that.\n\n145\n00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.090\nAnd then we wrap up the show just\ntalking about System Management,\n\n146\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.950\nand a better name for that section\nwould really be troubleshooting.\n\n147\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.270\nWhat do you do when the Mac is not\nbehaving the way it's supposed to?\n\n148\n00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.900\nWe know it has all these great features\nthat are supposed to work like magic, but\n\n149\n00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.800\nsometimes it just doesn't work out that\nway and we've got to troubleshoot it.\n\n150\n00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.454\nSo I spend a lot of time in that\nsection covering all the really amazing\n\n151\n00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:39.935\ntroubleshooting tools that are built into\nMac OS and built into the Apple hardware.\n\n152\n00:07:39.935 --> 00:07:42.848\nAnd it's part of what makes that\necosystem so valuable to us.\n\n153\n00:07:42.848 --> 00:07:45.670\nSo those are the topics that we're gonna\nbe covering throughout this series.\n\n154\n00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.478\nIt's all broken up into 30 minute\nepisodes that are nice and\n\n155\n00:07:48.478 --> 00:07:50.120\neasy to consume and watch.\n\n156\n00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.630\nWe cover it all,\nit's a great certification.\n\n157\n00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.860\nI really like this one because\nit covers real world skills.\n\n158\n00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.850\nEvery one of these technologies are ones\nthat I've used in the real world.\n\n159\n00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.410\nSometime you get these certifications\nwhere they cover technologies and\n\n160\n00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.130\nyou look at it and you're like, wow,\n\n161\n00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.130\nthis is more like a marketing slide,\nI'm never gonna us this is real life.\n\n162\n00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.170\nBut this is stuff you will.\n\n163\n00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.000\nEverything in here are things you'll\nencounter on a regular basis, and\n\n164\n00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.880\nit's excellent knowledge to know.\n\n165\n00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.453\nSo I encourage anybody who\nsupports Macs in a school or\n\n166\n00:08:14.453 --> 00:08:18.170\nbusiness environment, anywhere where\nyou have more than, say, ten Macs,\n\n167\n00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.390\nit's really valuable to do\nthe certification, it's a great one to do.\n\n168\n00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.660\nAll right, so let's say you watched the\nshow, you learn all the great information,\n\n169\n00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.970\nyou're ready to take the test,\nyou wanna get certified.\n\n170\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.570\nWell, the ACSP is a little\nbit different than the ACA.\n\n171\n00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.070\nThe ACA exams,\nthe Mac Management Basics and\n\n172\n00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.780\nMac Integration Basics, you can take those\nonline from the comfort of your own home.\n\n173\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.770\nYou sign up right on Apple's website and\nthat's it.\n\n174\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.910\nBut with ACSP and ACTC,\n\n175\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.606\nyou can only take them at Apple\nAuthorized Training Centers, or AATCs.\n\n176\n00:08:47.606 --> 00:08:49.640\nNow, there are AATCs all over the world,\nso\n\n177\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.630\nyou just need to find one that's near you.\n\n178\n00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.550\nAnd if you go to Apple's website,\nif you go to training.apple.com,\n\n179\n00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.390\nthey've actually got a lot of\nthem located right on there.\n\n180\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.580\nYou can search and find them and\nregister for the exam.\n\n181\n00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.890\nBut the point is you've gotta\ndrive there to take it.\n\n182\n00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.620\nSo you've gotta go somewhere and\nactually take this exam.\n\n183\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.050\nThe exam is two hours long,\nso it's a long exam,\n\n184\n00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.940\nyou're gonna be in that\ntesting booth a while.\n\n185\n00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.080\nIt's got 80 questions, so it's about\na minute and a half per question.\n\n186\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.400\nAs long as you stick to that, you'll\ncome in on time and finish the exam.\n\n187\n00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.433\nIf you take more then a minute and a half\non a question then you might run out of\n\n188\n00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:21.142\ntime, right, so you've gotta stay\nfocused and move through it.\n\n189\n00:09:21.142 --> 00:09:24.260\nOf the 80 questions,\nthere's 5 that aren't scored.\n\n190\n00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.378\nThey're kind of like demographic\nsurvey-type questions where they're just\n\n191\n00:09:27.378 --> 00:09:30.100\ntesting out something, and\nso they don't count those.\n\n192\n00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.470\nBut you don't know which five they are.\n\n193\n00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.670\nSo it really doesn't matter\nthat five of them are unscored,\n\n194\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.020\nyou need to do well on all of them.\n\n195\n00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.760\nThe questions are mostly multiple choice.\n\n196\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.760\nYou'll find that almost every\none is multiple choice.\n\n197\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.220\nSome will be true and false, and\nothers might be a media experience,\n\n198\n00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.360\nwhere it shows you a picture of\nthe system preferences screen.\n\n199\n00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.980\nAnd it says click on the system\npreference that does xyz task, and\n\n200\n00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:51.740\nyou've got to click on the one.\n\n201\n00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.920\nSo, its a graphical element\ninvolved in the question.\n\n202\n00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.860\nBut the bulk of them are just multiple\nchoice and so you can use process of\n\n203\n00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.290\nelimination and the other things we've\nhoned through years of public schooling,\n\n204\n00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.320\nright, to figure out what\nthat right answer is.\n\n205\n00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.180\nAnd I'll be honest with you guys,\nthis exam is really straightforward,\n\n206\n00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.070\nthere's no trick questions on there,\neverything is really practical.\n\n207\n00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.830\nIt really is a great certification,\nI've always been pleased with this one.\n\n208\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.430\nIt's a neat one.\n\n209\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.400\nNow, the exam cost, I can't really\ntell you that because it varies based\n\n210\n00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.940\non region, whichever country you're in.\n\n211\n00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.610\nThey have different pricing,\nand so it can vary.\n\n212\n00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.980\nBut it's not a terribly expensive exam.\n\n213\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:32.000\nThe only hard part is having to go to\nan AATC to take it, so just remember that.\n\n214\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.080\nBut, otherwise,\nthat's basically it for the exam.\n\n215\n00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.330\nSo I've talked about the ACSP\ncertification is, I've talked about what\n\n216\n00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.370\nwe're gonna cover on the show, all those\ndifferent topics that we need to know,\n\n217\n00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.670\nI also talked about where\nwe can take the exam.\n\n218\n00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.730\nThe only other thing that I wannna mention\nis that Apple has a really good study\n\n219\n00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.070\nguide for the ACSP.\n\n220\n00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.040\nLet me get back to their\nwebsite real quick, and\n\n221\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.450\non the page that I was showing you,\nthis is me at training.apple.com.\n\n222\n00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:03.690\nSo if you go to training.apple.com, you\ncan find the OS X Certifications section.\n\n223\n00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:08.180\nAnd under OS X Certifications, you'll\nfind where it tells you about that exam.\n\n224\n00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.230\nAnd over here to the side, you'll\nsee where it tells you to get ready,\n\n225\n00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.800\nthere's an El Capitan 101 Course.\n\n226\n00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.180\nThat's an official course you can\ntake at the AATCs if you want.\n\n227\n00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.590\nAnd there's an Exam Preparation Guide.\n\n228\n00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.440\nDownload that guide, it's free,\nit doesn't cost you a dime.\n\n229\n00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.230\nYou can download it.\n\n230\n00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.510\nIt is, I can't remember exactly how\nlong it is, about 75 pages, I think.\n\n231\n00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.860\nAnd it tells you a little bit\nabout the exam and what to expect,\n\n232\n00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.500\nsome of the different things that\nyou can kind of expect to see.\n\n233\n00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.010\nAnd that helps you to get ready.\n\n234\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.750\nAnd between that and\nthe content that we cover in the show,\n\n235\n00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.560\nyou'll see the bulk of what's\ngonna be on that exam.\n\n236\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.610\nYou'll be all prepared,\nready to go in there, and\n\n237\n00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.480\nready to pass and get your certification.\n\n238\n00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.720\nSo that's about it for the ACSP.\n\n239\n00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.040\nIf that sounds exciting to you,\nsomething you wanna jump in and pursue,\n\n240\n00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.370\nthen you are in the right place.\n\n241\n00:11:53.370 -->
