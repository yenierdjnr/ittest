Professional\ntraining here on ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.826\nNow the ACSP's been around a while, and\n\n4\n00:00:10.826 --> 00:00:12.580\nthis is not the first\ntime we've filmed it.\n\n5\n00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.305\nThis is actually the updated version for\nMacOS Sierra or OS 10.12.\n\n6\n00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:20.820\nNow the ACSP, if you've never heard of it,\nis the certification that is designed\n\n7\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.710\nreally for anybody who has to support\nApple computers in the workplace.\n\n8\n00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.680\nWe are seeing Apples market\nshare grow year after year.\n\n9\n00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.858\nMore and more people are using\nMacBook Pros, iMacs, Mac Minis and\n\n10\n00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:37.276\nwe're seeing them not just at home but\nin the workplace environment.\n\n11\n00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:41.370\nAnd so what the Apple certifies for\nprofessional design to do is to help, you,\n\n12\n00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.587\nany system administrator that's out there\nwho's gotta be able to support these\n\n13\n00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:47.218\ndevices in a corporate world.\n\n14\n00:00:47.218 --> 00:00:50.205\nNow, I keep saying that in\nthe business like corporate side.\n\n15\n00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:53.930\nThe reason I mention that is a lot\nof what we learn applies home users\n\n16\n00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.720\nas well as business users but\n\n17\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.830\nthere are certain things that are really\nour focus on the business site.\n\n18\n00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.180\nLike doing streamline\ndeployments of applications or\n\n19\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.510\nmanaging, restricting when applications\ncan either run on a particular device.\n\n20\n00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.940\nBeing able to control that type of\nfunctionality is really important\n\n21\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.870\nto successfully managing\nMacs in the workplace.\n\n22\n00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.130\nBut even for home use, there's a lot of\nadvanced features, like multiple user\n\n23\n00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.210\naccounts, and disk encryption that a lot\nof people just don't take advantage of.\n\n24\n00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.710\nAnd they're a check mark away from\nactually enabling some great feature to\n\n25\n00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.410\nprotect their information,\nif they only know it's there.\n\n26\n00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.120\nSo if you find yourself in that position\nwhere you're now responsible for\n\n27\n00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.180\nsupporting Apple computers\nin the workplace or\n\n28\n00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.000\nat home, the ACSP is really\na great certification for you.\n\n29\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.710\nLets take a look in\nthe certification itself.\n\n30\n00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.726\nI've got an Apple's web page pulled\nup here and on their Training and\n\n31\n00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:44.377\nCertification web page you'll see what\nthey got a few different certifications.\n\n32\n00:01:44.377 --> 00:01:47.595\nThe ACSP falls on the IT\nprofessional certifications, so\n\n33\n00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:48.990\nif we browse into there.\n\n34\n00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.250\nYou'll see that they've only got two\ncertifications that have been updated for\n\n35\n00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.910\nMacOS Sierra, so far.\n\n36\n00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.130\nThey haven't announced any plans to\nupdate some of their other ones.\n\n37\n00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.730\nThere's Mac Management Basics,\nis another one, and\n\n38\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.390\nthe Apple-Certified Technical Coordinator.\n\n39\n00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.055\nThose haven't been updated to Sierra yet.\n\n40\n00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:05.795\nI'm not sure if those\nare coming in the future.\n\n41\n00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:07.675\nThey haven't announced any plans on it.\n\n42\n00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:10.975\nBut right now,\nwe've got the Mac Integration Basics,\n\n43\n00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:14.195\nwhich we've already filmed as\na separate series, and the ACSP,\n\n44\n00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:17.102\nwhich is what we're focusing\non here in this series.\n\n45\n00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:18.762\nNow, the certification is the ACSP.\n\n46\n00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:21.172\nThey have an exam that's tied to it.\n\n47\n00:02:21.172 --> 00:02:23.412\nYou pass the exam,\nyou get the certification.\n\n48\n00:02:23.412 --> 00:02:28.167\nThe exam itself is called\nMacOS Support Essentials 10.12.\n\n49\n00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:32.332\nYou'll hear people refer to this\ncertification in the exam by both names.\n\n50\n00:02:32.332 --> 00:02:35.392\nSo it gets a little bit confusing but\nthey're both referring to the same thing.\n\n51\n00:02:35.392 --> 00:02:38.552\nThe exam has one name,\nthe certification has a different name.\n\n52\n00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:42.640\nAnd the reason for that Is there's\na second course that hasn't been updated\n\n53\n00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.380\nyet, that also grants the ACSP.\n\n54\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.130\nThere's two different\nexams that get the ACSP.\n\n55\n00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.660\nThat's why we have these different names.\n\n56\n00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.950\nNow the exam itself is a computer-based,\nproctored exam.\n\n57\n00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.400\nYou do have to take it at\nan Apple-authorized training provider.\n\n58\n00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.400\nThey've got a link right here,\n\n59\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.160\nto find an Apple-authorized\ntraining provider near you.\n\n60\n00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.510\nAnybody can take the course, anybody can\nlearn the material, it's really useful\n\n61\n00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.910\ninformation to learn and it'll help you\nmanage those devices in your environment.\n\n62\n00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.410\nBut if you wanna take the exam,\n\n63\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.470\nyou do have to go down to\nan authorized training provider.\n\n64\n00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.450\nThen the exam itself,\n\n65\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.115\nif you click on the Exam Preparation Guide\nit'll tell you about it.\n\n66\n00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:21.755\nBasically, what it boils down to\nis a pretty straightforward exam.\n\n67\n00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:25.915\nIt has 80 technical questions that\nyou have to two hours to complete.\n\n68\n00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:27.832\nSo you've got plenty\nof time to go through.\n\n69\n00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:30.002\nThe majority of the questions\nare multiple choice.\n\n70\n00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:33.712\nSo you read the question, you choose the\nbest answer, you move onto the next one.\n\n71\n00:03:33.712 --> 00:03:36.552\nA passing score is 75% or higher.\n\n72\n00:03:36.552 --> 00:03:39.600\nSo it's actually not really that hard.\n\n73\n00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.140\nAs long as you've studied,\nyou've learned the material, and\n\n74\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.610\nyou understand the concepts, you'll find\nthat the exam is not that challenging.\n\n75\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.700\nWell, what are the concepts?\n\n76\n00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.390\nThere's a lot.\n\n77\n00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.780\nThat's really the biggest\nchallenge with the certification,\n\n78\n00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.040\nis there is a ton of information\nburied inside of it.\n\n79\n00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.340\nFor example, we start with\ninstallation and configuration.\n\n80\n00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.450\nJust getting MacOS Sierra up and\nrunning on a system.\n\n81\n00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.080\nFrom there, you move on to the next\narea which is User Accounts, right.\n\n82\n00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.870\nActually getting user accounts\nset up in the system,\n\n83\n00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.800\nmanaging more than one user account\non an individual Individual system.\n\n84\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.810\nWe go on to talk about printer sharing.\n\n85\n00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.930\nWe talk about joining directories,\nmanaging security.\n\n86\n00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.370\nThen you'll see if I scroll to this,\n\n87\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.860\nit just goes on and on and\non all the different areas.\n\n88\n00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.520\nAnd I say like it's a bad thing.\n\n89\n00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.550\nIt goes on and on and on.\n\n90\n00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.580\nIt's not a bad thing.\n\n91\n00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.800\nIt's just that there is a lot that you\ncan do inside of MacOS especially in\n\n92\n00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.130\na business environment that if you take\nadvantage of all these features, you can\n\n93\n00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.860\nreally have a very powerful system and\nmake it very easy to manage and support.\n\n94\n00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.440\nAnd that's really the key thing here to\nremember is the target audience for this.\n\n95\n00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.770\nThe target audience for\nthis is not the end-user, right?\n\n96\n00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.340\nA lot of this is information an end user\nis not going to have to deal with on any\n\n97\n00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.350\nregular basis.\n\n98\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.160\nThis is desktop support engineers and\nsystem administrators who are responsible\n\n99\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.230\nfor managing Apple\ndevices in the workplace.\n\n100\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.950\nAnd really it's focused on\nthe OS X devices, not iOS,\n\n101\n00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.650\nwe talk about iOS in another series.\n\n102\n00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.501\nBut in the OS X world, we're talking\nabout MacBooks, MacBook Pros,\n\n103\n00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.910\nMacBook Air, iMacs, Mac Pros, Mac Minis.\n\n104\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.630\nAll of those devices run OS X and\n\n105\n00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.890\nMac OS Sierra has introduced some new\nfeatures that are pretty exciting.\n\n106\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.470\nAnd we need to make sure we\nunderstand how to manage those, and\n\n107\n00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.710\nhow to control the devices\nin our environment.\n\n108\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.080\nNow, if you are just getting started with\nMacOS, this is actually a great place.\n\n109\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.800\nWe run through it really\nfrom the beginning and\n\n110\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.390\nmove into the advanced features.\n\n111\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.450\nIf you're an expert,\n\n112\n00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.210\nyou've been working with it a long time,\nit's still a great series to run\n\n113\n00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.720\nthrough cuz you're gonna learn about some\nof the new features found in Sierra.\n\n114\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.930\nAnd you'll find that there's a lot of\nthe old features that are still the same,\n\n115\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.270\nthat you kinda maintain\nthe same skill set and\n\n116\n00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.450\nare able to continue\nto support the system.\n\n117\n00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.920\nNow there is another course that we have\nin our course library I wanna make you\n\n118\n00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.120\naware of, which is Mac Integration Basics.\n\n119\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.690\nMac Integration Basics focuses on\n\n120\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.500\nconnecting Macs to\na Microsoft Windows network.\n\n121\n00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.510\nIn the business world,\n\n122\n00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.430\nyou'll find that Microsoft Windows\nhas the dominant market share.\n\n123\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.990\nSo normally when we deploy Macs\nin a business environment,\n\n124\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.200\nwe gotta get them talking\nto a Windows network.\n\n125\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.340\nAnd that's what Mac\nintegration basics tackles.\n\n126\n00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.960\nSo if you're the person that's out there\nin the field that's actually trying to\n\n127\n00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.970\nmake these Macs work in a business,\nyou'll find that other course,\n\n128\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.740\nMac Integration Basics is\npretty beneficial too.\n\n129\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.390\nBut I would recommend\ncompleting this one first.\n\n130\n00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.810\nThis course is gonna show\nyou how to manage MacOS,\n\n131\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.470\nhow to work with the operating system to\nget it functioning right before we start\n\n132\n00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.940\nintegrated it into Windows,\nwhich is a really handy thing to have.\n\n133\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.300\nSo this is a great place to start,\nright here.\n\n134\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.050\nIf you already have this requisite\nknowledge though, and you're just looking\n\n135\n00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.160\nfor that Windows compatibility side,\njump over to Mac Integration Basics.\n\n136\n00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.590\nI think you'll find what you want there,\na little more in detail.\n\n137\n00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.540\nAll right,\nwell if this all sounds exciting to you,\n\n138\n00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.430\nsomething you wanna learn,\nyou're in the right place.\n\n139\n00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.080\nStay tuned,\n\n140\n00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.730\ncuz Mac Integration Basics is, or sorry,\nI gotta get my certification right.\n\n141\n00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.570\nApple Certified Support Professional\nis coming up right after this, but\n\n142\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.500\ndo remember Mac Integration Basics\nis part of the course library and\n\n143\n00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.230\nis part of your ITProTV subscription.\n\n144\n00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.350\nSo be sure to check that one out too.\n\n145\n00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.068\nAll right I hope you guys enjoyed it and\nI'll see you in the episodes.\n\n146\n00:06:53.068 --> 00:06:53.568\n[SOUND]\n\n",
