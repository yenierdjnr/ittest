Professional\ntraining here on ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.826\nNow the ACSP's been around a while, and\n\n4\n00:00:10.826 --> 00:00:12.580\nthis is not the first\ntime we've filmed it.\n\n5\n00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.305\nThis is actually the updated version for\nMacOS Sierra or OS 10.12.\n\n6\n00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:20.820\nNow the ACSP, if you've never heard of it,\nis the certification that is designed\n\n7\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.710\nreally for anybody who has to support\nApple computers in the workplace.\n\n8\n00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.680\nWe are seeing Apples market\nshare grow year after year.\n\n9\n00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.858\nMore and more people are using\nMacBook Pros, iMacs, Mac Minis and\n\n10\n00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:37.276\nwe're seeing them not just at home but\nin the workplace environment.\n\n11\n00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:41.370\nAnd so what the Apple certifies for\nprofessional design to do is to help, you,\n\n12\n00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.587\nany system administrator that's out there\nwho's gotta be able to support these\n\n13\n00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:47.218\ndevices in a corporate world.\n\n14\n00:00:47.218 --> 00:00:50.205\nNow, I keep saying that in\nthe business like corporate side.\n\n15\n00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:53.930\nThe reason I mention that is a lot\nof what we learn applies home users\n\n16\n00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.720\nas well as business users but\n\n17\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.830\nthere are certain things that are really\nour focus on the business site.\n\n18\n00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.180\nLike doing streamline\ndeployments of applications or\n\n19\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.510\nmanaging, restricting when applications\ncan either run on a particular device.\n\n20\n00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.940\nBeing able to control that type of\nfunctionality is really important\n\n21\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.870\nto successfully managing\nMacs in the workplace.\n\n22\n00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.130\nBut even for home use, there's a lot of\nadvanced features, like multiple user\n\n23\n00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.210\naccounts, and disk encryption that a lot\nof people just don't take advantage of.\n\n24\n00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.710\nAnd they're a check mark away from\nactually enabling some great feature to\n\n25\n00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.410\nprotect their information,\nif they only know it's there.\n\n26\n00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.120\nSo if you find yourself in that position\nwhere you're now responsible for\n\n27\n00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.180\nsupporting Apple computers\nin the workplace or\n\n28\n00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.000\nat home, the ACSP is really\na great certification for you.\n\n29\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.710\nLets take a look in\nthe certification itself.\n\n30\n00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.726\nI've got an Apple's web page pulled\nup here and on their Training and\n\n31\n00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:44.377\nCertification web page you'll see what\nthey got a few different certifications.\n\n32\n00:01:44.377 --> 00:01:47.595\nThe ACSP falls on the IT\nprofessional certifications, so\n\n33\n00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:48.990\nif we browse into there.\n\n34\n00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.250\nYou'll see that they've only got two\ncertifications that have been updated for\n\n35\n00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.910\nMacOS Sierra, so far.\n\n36\n00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.130\nThey haven't announced any plans to\nupdate some of their other ones.\n\n37\n00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.730\nThere's Mac Management Basics,\nis another one, and\n\n38\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.390\nthe Apple-Certified Technical Coordinator.\n\n39\n00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.055\nThose haven't been updated to Sierra yet.\n\n40\n00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:05.795\nI'm not sure if those\nare coming in the future.\n\n41\n00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:07.675\nThey haven't announced any plans on it.\n\n42\n00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:10.975\nBut right now,\nwe've got the Mac Integration Basics,\n\n43\n00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:14.195\nwhich we've already filmed as\na separate series, and the ACSP,\n\n44\n00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:17.102\nwhich is what we're focusing\non here in this series.\n\n45\n00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:18.762\nNow, the certification is the ACSP.\n\n46\n00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:21.172\nThey have an exam that's tied to it.\n\n47\n00:02:21.172 --> 00:02:23.412\nYou pass the exam,\nyou get the certification.\n\n48\n00:02:23.412 --> 00:02:28.167\nThe exam itself is called\nMacOS Support Essentials 10.12.\n\n49\n00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:32.332\nYou'll hear people refer to this\ncertification in the exam by both names.\n\n50\n00:02:32.332 --> 00:02:35.392\nSo it gets a little bit confusing but\nthey're both referring to the same thing.\n\n51\n00:02:35.392 --> 00:02:38.552\nThe exam has one name,\nthe certification has a different name.\n\n52\n00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:42.640\nAnd the reason for that Is there's\na second course that hasn't been updated\n\n53\n00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.380\nyet, that also grants the ACSP.\n\n54\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.130\nThere's two different\nexams that get the ACSP.\n\n55\n00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.660\nThat's why we have these different names.\n\n56\n00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.950\nNow the exam itself is a computer-based,\nproctored exam.\n\n57\n00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.400\nYou do have to take it at\nan Apple-authorized training provider.\n\n58\n00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.400\nThey've got a link right here,\n\n59\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.160\nto find an Apple-authorized\ntraining provider near you.\n\n60\n00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.510\nAnybody can take the course, anybody can\nlearn the material, it's really useful\n\n61\n00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.910\ninformation to learn and it'll help you\nmanage those devices in your environment.\n\n62\n00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.410\nBut if you wanna take the exam,\n\n63\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.470\nyou do have to go down to\nan authorized training provider.\n\n64\n00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.450\nThen the exam itself,\n\n65\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.115\nif you click on the Exam Preparation Guide\nit'll tell you about it.\n\n66\n00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:21.755\nBasically, what it boils down to\nis a pretty straightforward exam.\n\n67\n00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:25.915\nIt has 80 technical questions that\nyou have to two hours to complete.\n\n68\n00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:27.832\nSo you've got plenty\nof time to go through.\n\n69\n00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:30.002\nThe majority of the questions\nare multiple choice.\n\n70\n00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:33.712\nSo you read the question, you choose the\nbest answer, you move onto the next one.\n\n71\n00:03:33.712 --> 00:03:36.552\nA passing score is 75% or higher.\n\n72\n00:03:36.552 --> 00:03:39.600\nSo it's actually not really that hard.\n\n73\n00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.140\nAs long as you've studied,\nyou've learned the material, and\n\n74\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.610\nyou understand the concepts, you'll find\nthat the exam is not that challenging.\n\n75\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.700\nWell, what are the concepts?\n\n76\n00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.390\nThere's a lot.\n\n77\n00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.780\nThat's really the biggest\nchallenge with the certification,\n\n78\n00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.040\nis there is a ton of information\nburied inside of it.\n\n79\n00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.340\nFor example, we start with\ninstallation and configuration.\n\n80\n00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.450\nJust getting MacOS Sierra up and\nrunning on a system.\n\n81\n00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.080\nFrom there, you move on to the next\narea which is User Accounts, right.\n\n82\n00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.870\nActually getting user accounts\nset up in the system,\n\n83\n00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.800\nmanaging more than one user account\non an individual Individual system.\n\n84\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.810\nWe go on to talk about printer sharing.\n\n85\n00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.930\nWe talk about joining directories,\nmanaging security.\n\n86\n00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.370\nThen you'll see if I scroll to this,\n\n87\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.860\nit just goes on and on and\non all the different areas.\n\n88\n00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.520\nAnd I say like it's a bad thing.\n\n89\n00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.550\nIt goes on and on and on.\n\n90\n00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.580\nIt's not a bad thing.\n\n91\n00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.800\nIt's just that there is a lot that you\ncan do inside of MacOS especially in\n\n92\n00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.130\na business environment that if you take\nadvantage of all these features, you can\n\n93\n00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.860\nreally have a very powerful system and\nmake it very easy to manage and support.\n\n94\n00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.440\nAnd that's really the key thing here to\nremember is the target audience for this.\n\n95\n00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.770\nThe target audience for\nthis is not the end-user, right?\n\n96\n00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.340\nA lot of this is information an end user\nis not going to have to deal with on any\n\n97\n00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.350\nregular basis.\n\n98\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.160\nThis is desktop support engineers and\nsystem administrators who are responsible\n\n99\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.230\nfor managing Apple\ndevices in the workplace.\n\n100\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.950\nAnd really it's focused on\nthe OS X devices, not iOS,\n\n101\n00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.650\nwe talk about iOS in another series.\n\n102\n00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.501\nBut in the OS X world, we're talking\nabout MacBooks, MacBook Pros,\n\n103\n00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.910\nMacBook Air, iMacs, Mac Pros, Mac Minis.\n\n104\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.630\nAll of those devices run OS X and\n\n105\n00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.890\nMac OS Sierra has introduced some new\nfeatures that are pretty exciting.\n\n106\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.470\nAnd we need to make sure we\nunderstand how to manage those, and\n\n107\n00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.710\nhow to control the devices\nin our environment.\n\n108\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.080\nNow, if you are just getting started with\nMacOS, this is actually a great place.\n\n109\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.800\nWe run through it really\nfrom the beginning and\n\n110\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.390\nmove into the advanced features.\n\n111\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.450\nIf you're an expert,\n\n112\n00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.210\nyou've been working with it a long time,\nit's still a great series to run\n\n113\n00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.720\nthrough cuz you're gonna learn about some\nof the new features found in Sierra.\n\n114\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.930\nAnd you'll find that there's a lot of\nthe old features that are still the same,\n\n115\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.270\nthat you kinda maintain\nthe same skill set and\n\n116\n00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.450\nare able to continue\nto support the system.\n\n117\n00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.920\nNow there is another course that we have\nin our course library I wanna make you\n\n118\n00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.120\naware of, which is Mac Integration Basics.\n\n119\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.690\nMac Integration Basics focuses on\n\n120\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.500\nconnecting Macs to\na Microsoft Windows network.\n\n121\n00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.510\nIn the business world,\n\n122\n00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.430\nyou'll find that Microsoft Windows\nhas the dominant market share.\n\n123\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.990\nSo normally when we deploy Macs\nin a business environment,\n\n124\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.200\nwe gotta get them talking\nto a Windows network.\n\n125\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.340\nAnd that's what Mac\nintegration basics tackles.\n\n126\n00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.960\nSo if you're the person that's out there\nin the field that's actually trying to\n\n127\n00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.970\nmake these Macs work in a business,\nyou'll find that other course,\n\n128\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.740\nMac Integration Basics is\npretty beneficial too.\n\n129\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.390\nBut I would recommend\ncompleting this one first.\n\n130\n00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.810\nThis course is gonna show\nyou how to manage MacOS,\n\n131\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.470\nhow to work with the operating system to\nget it functioning right before we start\n\n132\n00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.940\nintegrated it into Windows,\nwhich is a really handy thing to have.\n\n133\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.300\nSo this is a great place to start,\nright here.\n\n134\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.050\nIf you already have this requisite\nknowledge though, and you're just looking\n\n135\n00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.160\nfor that Windows compatibility side,\njump over to Mac Integration Basics.\n\n136\n00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.590\nI think you'll find what you want there,\na little more in detail.\n\n137\n00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.540\nAll right,\nwell if this all sounds exciting to you,\n\n138\n00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.430\nsomething you wanna learn,\nyou're in the right place.\n\n139\n00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.080\nStay tuned,\n\n140\n00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.730\ncuz Mac Integration Basics is, or sorry,\nI gotta get my certification right.\n\n141\n00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.570\nApple Certified Support Professional\nis coming up right after this, but\n\n142\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.500\ndo remember Mac Integration Basics\nis part of the course library and\n\n143\n00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.230\nis part of your ITProTV subscription.\n\n144\n00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.350\nSo be sure to check that one out too.\n\n145\n00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.068\nAll right I hope you guys enjoyed it and\nI'll see you in the episodes.\n\n146\n00:06:53.068 --> 00:06:53.568\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.378\nWelcome to ITProTV,\n\n2\n00:00:01.378 --> 00:00:05.343\nI'm your host Don Pezet coming at you\nlive from San Francisco, California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.343 --> 00:00:10.600\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.161\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to ITProTV,\nthanks for joining us.\n\n5\n00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:17.503\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode, we got a great show for\n\n6\n00:00:17.503 --> 00:00:18.070\nyou today.\n\n7\n00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.980\nWe're gonna be looking at\nthe Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n8\n00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.210\nAnd joining us in the studio is none\nother than ITProTVs very own, Don Pizet.\n\n9\n00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.290\nDon, how do you doing sir?\n\n10\n00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.268\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:27.268 --> 00:00:31.420\nReady to kick off a new series and we're\njumping into well ACSP like Wes said and\n\n12\n00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.100\nspecifically taking\na look at macOS Sierra.\n\n13\n00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.690\nThat's right the ACSP has been updated\nto cover our new certification then\n\n14\n00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.300\nwe need to be ready to get it\ninstalled and up and going.\n\n15\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.303\nSo that's exactly where we're gonna\nstart right at the very beginning.\n\n16\n00:00:43.303 --> 00:00:46.037\nWe're gonna learn about macOS Sierra,\nwe need to get it installed,\n\n17\n00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:48.830\nthere's a few things that we need to\nbe aware of before we get started.\n\n18\n00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.176\nWell the first I wanna talk about with\nSierra is understanding whether or\n\n19\n00:00:53.176 --> 00:00:55.890\nnot we can even run it in the first place.\n\n20\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.800\nApple is really, really good about\npushing updates out to Mac hardware\n\n21\n00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.565\neven Mac hardware that's pretty dated,\nright?\n\n22\n00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:07.789\nA lot of times we'll get a MacBook or an\niMac, or a Mac Mini, and they'll run for\n\n23\n00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.694\nyears and years and years, right?\n\n24\n00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:12.794\nWhen we buy one,\nthey might have a one-year warranty, but\n\n25\n00:01:12.794 --> 00:01:15.535\nyou can upgrade it to\na three-year with AppleCare.\n\n26\n00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:20.995\nBut you might find you get five, six,\nseven years out of a laptop or a desktop.\n\n27\n00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:23.970\nAnd it's not uncommon, because\nthe hardware's really high quality.\n\n28\n00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.870\nWell one of the challenges other\nvendors have is that after a few years\n\n29\n00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.670\nthe hardware's usually no longer\nsupported, you don't get updates.\n\n30\n00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.490\nWith Apple they do a good job of that, but\n\n31\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.610\nit doesn't mean that we\ncan go all the way back.\n\n32\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.874\nYou're not gonna fire up\nyour Apple II [LAUGH] and\n\n33\n00:01:38.874 --> 00:01:40.390\ninstall macOS Sierra on it, right?\n\n34\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.757\nSo there are some requirements we need\nto understand whether our hardware\n\n35\n00:01:42.757 --> 00:01:43.489\nis compatible or not.\n\n36\n00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:47.496\nAnd so, I've got Apple's official tech\nsupport page brought up here that has\n\n37\n00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:49.864\nthe general requirements for\nmacOS Sierra and\n\n38\n00:01:49.864 --> 00:01:52.870\nyou'll see it actually\ndoes go back quite a ways.\n\n39\n00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.700\nBasically the rule of thumb is if your\nMac Book came and I say Mac Book,\n\n40\n00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.030\nit could be a Mac Pro or an iMac,\nMac Mini, any of the Mac OS devices.\n\n41\n00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.285\nIf it shipped with OS X 10.7.5 or later,\n\n42\n00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:12.133\nthen the odds are you'll be\nable to upgrade to Sierra.\n\n43\n00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:15.007\nIf it shipped with 10.7.5.\n\n44\n00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:18.729\nBut even if it didn't ship with 10.7.5\nthere's a good chance you'll be able to\n\n45\n00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.580\nupgrade, because the hardware\nrequirements are pretty small.\n\n46\n00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.630\n2 gigs of memory 8.8 gigs of storage and\n\n47\n00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.320\njust a couple of other, these are really\nkind of software features, right?\n\n48\n00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.900\nIf you want to use things like iCloud\nyou're gonna have to have an Apple ID.\n\n49\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.270\nIf you want to have certain things,\n\n50\n00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.890\nwell again like iCloud,\nyou need internet access, right?\n\n51\n00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.780\nSo those aren't really hardware\nrequirements, that's just software.\n\n52\n00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.410\nBut on the hardware side, 2 gigs of\nmemory, 8.8 gigs of available storage.\n\n53\n00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.610\nNow this has changed a little bit\nfrom El Capitan which only required 8\n\n54\n00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.310\ngigs of storage.\n\n55\n00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.830\nIt's grown a bit and\nreally largely you can thank Siri and\n\n56\n00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.370\na few other new features for that.\n\n57\n00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.040\nThey consume a little more disk space.\n\n58\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.530\nBut in today's day and age 8.8 gigs\nis a laughable amount of storage so\n\n59\n00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.360\nit's not a huge amount that\nwe need to have there.\n\n60\n00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.880\nAnother thing that they don't list\nanymore is that you do need to have\n\n61\n00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.290\nan Intel processor.\n\n62\n00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.320\nThey don't make a macOS Sierra for\nPowerPC.\n\n63\n00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.600\nPowerPC systems are no longer supported.\n\n64\n00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.220\nIn fact, not even all the Intel\nsystems are supported.\n\n65\n00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.640\nIf I scroll down a little bit here,\nyou'll see the minimum requirements, and\n\n66\n00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.700\nthe cut-off date is really 2009.\n\n67\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.440\nAnything manufactured before 2009\nis not supported for macOS Sierra.\n\n68\n00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.350\nBut you'll see if you have\na MacBook late 2009 or\n\n69\n00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.760\nnewer, an iMac late 2009 or\nnewer you're gonna be good to go.\n\n70\n00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.260\nWith the MacBook Pro and Airs, the Mac\nminis those are late 2010 or newer.\n\n71\n00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.464\nWell, here we are filming this episode,\nand it is what we consider early 2017.\n\n72\n00:03:46.464 --> 00:03:49.770\nSo if you have a late 2010 or\nmid 2010 device,\n\n73\n00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.178\nwe're talking about a seven-year-old\npiece of equipment here, and\n\n74\n00:03:54.178 --> 00:03:57.130\nyou're still able to\nupgrade to macOS Sierra.\n\n75\n00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.360\nSo that's a really cool\nthing that Apple does.\n\n76\n00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.140\nDoesn't necessarily mean\nthat you want to though.\n\n77\n00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.540\nIf you got a seven-year-old device,\nit's more than likely time to replace.\n\n78\n00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.190\nYou know, these things, they get slower.\n\n79\n00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.635\nThe newer processors are faster,\nmore memory.\n\n80\n00:04:09.635 --> 00:04:11.650\nYou'll typically want to go and\nupgrade that hardware.\n\n81\n00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.540\n&gt;&gt; So Don if I've done my homework and\nI've been up to the website there,\n\n82\n00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.750\nand I've taken my little scratch pad and I\ncan see what the minimum requirements are,\n\n83\n00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.370\nI know that's where\nthat is on the website.\n\n84\n00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.270\nNow where would I find\nthat inside of my system?\n\n85\n00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.010\nSo if I've got a Mac right here in\nfront of me, where am I gonna find that\n\n86\n00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.680\ninformation to verify that it does\nmeet the requirements on the website?\n\n87\n00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.130\n&gt;&gt; Great question because maybe I've\ngot a laptop that somebody gave me, and\n\n88\n00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.350\nit happens, where they get handed down\namongst family members, or whatever.\n\n89\n00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.870\nI don't know if it's a late 2010,\nor whatever.\n\n90\n00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.166\nActually, my own Mac Book right here\nin front of me, I can't remember.\n\n91\n00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:45.092\nI know it's a Mac Book 2013 I believe\nis what mine is, and it could be late,\n\n92\n00:04:45.092 --> 00:04:47.580\nor early, or mid, I don't know.\n\n93\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.670\nSo we can find that a few different ways.\n\n94\n00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.680\nWe can find the information.\n\n95\n00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.820\nDo I have two gigs of RAM?\n\n96\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.170\nDo I have enough hard drive space?\n\n97\n00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.090\nSo let's take a look at what we would\nneed to do to find that information on\n\n98\n00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.720\nour system.\n\n99\n00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.780\nThe easiest place to look, right off the\nbat, is, if you go up to your Apple menu,\n\n100\n00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.190\nup top, and under the Apple menu\nyou can go to About This Mac.\n\n101\n00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.080\nAnd inside About This Mac, you'll get\na breakdown of the operating system that\n\n102\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.830\nyou're currently running as well as\nbasic information about your hardware.\n\n103\n00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.180\nSo I can see that I am running\na MacBook Pro Retina 13-inch, Late 2013.\n\n104\n00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.570\nSo I'm covered, I can run Sierra.\n\n105\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.430\nAnd I see that I've got 16 gigs of memory.\n\n106\n00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.850\nI only need two gigs of memory to run\nSierra so I'm good to go there also.\n\n107\n00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.366\nNow it doesn't tell me about how\nmuch hard drive space I have.\n\n108\n00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:37.710\nI'm gonna need 8.8 gigs to do the install,\nso\n\n109\n00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.090\nI need to make sure I've\ngot that space available.\n\n110\n00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.200\nWell, you can find that pretty\neasily a few different ways.\n\n111\n00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.940\nNow there's the official way that's\nin the book but what I usually do,\n\n112\n00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.880\nit's a little bit faster,\nis if you just go into your finder.\n\n113\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.410\nInside of your finder, you can find\nyour hard drive and if you do a Cmd+I or\n\n114\n00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.520\na Ctrl+click and Get info that'll\nbring up your Get info screen and\n\n115\n00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.550\nit'll tell you how much\ndisk space you have.\n\n116\n00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.754\nAnd so I can see for me I've got a 500\ngig disk, or 499.42 GB, close enough.\n\n117\n00:06:09.754 --> 00:06:12.680\nAnd I've got 393 GB available.\n\n118\n00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.490\nSo plenty of space available for doing the\ninstall and the upgrade I'm good to go.\n\n119\n00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.530\nIf you don't have 8.8 gigs of space\navailable, then you've got two choices.\n\n120\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.670\nChoice number one, delete some stuff.\n\n121\n00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.970\nYou might have some things on there you\ndon't need, you need to free up that room.\n\n122\n00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.190\nChoice number two, during\nthe install you can format your Mac.\n\n123\n00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.580\nYou can wipe it completely and\nerase it and do a clean install.\n\n124\n00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.010\nBut you might not want that if you've got\na lot of data that you wanna preserve.\n\n125\n00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.528\nGot a lot of applications, things like\nthat, you may not want to erase it.\n\n126\n00:06:40.528 --> 00:06:42.050\nBut those are kind of our choices there.\n\n127\n00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.790\nAll right, now there is another\nplace I could've gone to get\n\n128\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.350\nall of this information.\n\n129\n00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.050\nAnd back here,\nunder my About This Mac screen,\n\n130\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.590\nyou'll see there's more data right here,\nacross the top tabs, right?\n\n131\n00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.918\nI can pull up my Displays,\nmy Storage and here,\n\n132\n00:06:56.918 --> 00:07:00.674\nI would've also seen that\nI had 393 GB available.\n\n133\n00:07:00.674 --> 00:07:02.770\nPlenty of space that's available.\n\n134\n00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.480\nAnd you can also pull up your Support and\nService information right there.\n\n135\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.410\nIf I go back to the Overview though,\nyou can get really detailed information\n\n136\n00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.570\nright here under your System Report,\nall right?\n\n137\n00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.370\nAnd I'm going into the System Report\nthrough the About This Mac window.\n\n138\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.120\nYou don't have to.\n\n139\n00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.310\nYou could just, from anywhere,\nbring up your spotlight and\n\n140\n00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:26.430\ntype in system information.\n\n141\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.380\nThere we go.\nSystem information if I can type,\n\n142\n00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.720\nthat's the hardest part doing it this\nway is typing system information.\n\n143\n00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.920\nAnd we can bring that up or\nyou can navigate into the folder.\n\n144\n00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.850\nIt's inside of the Applications and\nUtilities folder on your disk.\n\n145\n00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.200\nAnd when you browse into that,\n\n146\n00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.190\nyou'll find really detailed\ninformation about your system.\n\n147\n00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.690\nNot just the general info I\nsaw a few moments ago, but\n\n148\n00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.830\neven more detailed data about the actual\nhardware that's a part of this.\n\n149\n00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.720\nSo you can really find every little\nbit of information that you need.\n\n150\n00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.430\nBut the reason I wanted to\nbring this up here on the show\n\n151\n00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.500\nis that every piece of Apple\nhardware actually has two names.\n\n152\n00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.650\nThere's the easy name, the friendly name,\nlike mine is a MacBook Pro Retina.\n\n153\n00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.571\nLate 2013, right,\nthat's the friendly name.\n\n154\n00:08:03.571 --> 00:08:06.133\nIt's not actually all that friendly,\nbut that's what they call it.\n\n155\n00:08:06.133 --> 00:08:10.108\nAnd then there's the official name,\nand the official name for\n\n156\n00:08:10.108 --> 00:08:12.358\nthis one is a MacBookPro 11,1.\n\n157\n00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:16.348\nAnd so you'll see that sometimes when\nyou're reading through the technical\n\n158\n00:08:16.348 --> 00:08:20.641\ndocumentation where they refer to hardware\nas saying like a MacBookPro 12,3 or\n\n159\n00:08:20.641 --> 00:08:23.770\nsomething like that,\nit'll be a different value.\n\n160\n00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.167\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, you've said in past episode or\n\n161\n00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:28.924\npast Apple shows that\nit's Unix underneath.\n\n162\n00:08:28.924 --> 00:08:30.097\nIs that a Unix thing, or\n\n163\n00:08:30.097 --> 00:08:34.520\nis that just an Apple naming convention\nwhen it comes to the unfriendly name?\n\n164\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.422\n&gt;&gt; This is an Apple thing, yeah, on\nthe Unix side, like the BSD that's running\n\n165\n00:08:38.422 --> 00:08:41.981\nunder the hood here, it really\ndoesn't have a name for the hardware.\n\n166\n00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:44.795\nIt has a name for its kernel and\nthe software, the whole Darwin system, but\n\n167\n00:08:44.795 --> 00:08:46.500\nwe'll see that in a later episode.\n\n168\n00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.370\nBut as far as the hardware here,\nit's Apple, they assign that.\n\n169\n00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:55.070\nAnd the reason they do that is sometimes,\nthere's variations amongst the build.\n\n170\n00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:00.015\nFor example, when I bought my laptop,\nI got the i7 processor.\n\n171\n00:09:00.015 --> 00:09:04.175\nBut it also shipped with an i5 processor,\nright?\n\n172\n00:09:04.175 --> 00:09:10.343\nWell, they're both MacBook Pro Retina\n2013, or late 2013s.\n\n173\n00:09:10.343 --> 00:09:12.850\nBut one has an i5 and one has an i7.\n\n174\n00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.614\nAnd in this naming convention,\nit may be, and don't quote me on this\n\n175\n00:09:17.614 --> 00:09:21.460\ncuz I might be wrong, but 11,1 for\nthe i7 and 11,2 for the i5, right?\n\n176\n00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.607\nBut usually what that'll denote is\nthe different hardware configurations that\n\n177\n00:09:24.607 --> 00:09:25.910\nwere available for that laptop.\n\n178\n00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.550\nAnd in fact, Wes, I think your laptop,\nyours might be identical to mine.\n\n179\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.250\nBut while they look identical, there\ncould be subtle variations in hardware,\n\n180\n00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:38.310\nwhere you find that your model number or\nwhatever is actually different.\n\n181\n00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.461\nSo if you click on your System Information\nbutton right there, the system report.\n\n182\n00:09:42.461 --> 00:09:43.640\n&gt;&gt; 12.1.\n\n183\n00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.765\n&gt;&gt; 12.1, okay, so yours is actually\na newer one than mine, and on your about\n\n184\n00:09:47.765 --> 00:09:51.841\nthis match screen, is yours late 2013,\nor are you supposed to be newer?\n\n185\n00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:55.863\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here,\nwhere do I see that, I see-\n\n186\n00:09:55.863 --> 00:09:57.395\n&gt;&gt; Wait, right there.\n\n187\n00:09:57.395 --> 00:09:59.192\n&gt;&gt; There we go, early 2015.\n\n188\n00:09:59.192 --> 00:10:01.580\n&gt;&gt; Early 2015,\nyou see who gets preference around here.\n\n189\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.796\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; We give this guy the new stuff.\n\n190\n00:10:02.796 --> 00:10:06.410\nSo early 2015 for his,\nand it's 12, 1, right?\n\n191\n00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.387\nSo it's not like the 12 indicates\nthe year cuz it was two years.\n\n192\n00:10:10.387 --> 00:10:13.851\nHis is two years newer than mine,\nand that's variation, now.\n\n193\n00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:16.962\nI know what you're thinking is,\nwait a minute, Don, you're here,\n\n194\n00:10:16.962 --> 00:10:21.080\nyou're doing a Mac show, and you're on\nthis laptop from 2013, that's crazy talk.\n\n195\n00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.055\nRight, and Wes has got one from 2015,\nwhy haven't I upgraded?\n\n196\n00:10:25.055 --> 00:10:26.410\nAnd there's a few reasons for that.\n\n197\n00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.806\nOne of the main reasons is that hardware\nreally hasn't changed much in the last\n\n198\n00:10:29.806 --> 00:10:30.376\nfour years.\n\n199\n00:10:30.376 --> 00:10:35.880\nSo that's something very common, that the\ni7 processors are relatively unchanged.\n\n200\n00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.873\nThe maximum amount of memory is still 16\ngigs on MacBooks, which I already have.\n\n201\n00:10:40.873 --> 00:10:45.392\nThe SSD sizes, they've become cheaper,\nbut they haven't really changed, so\n\n202\n00:10:45.392 --> 00:10:47.391\nmy 500 gig SSD, it's all good.\n\n203\n00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:50.656\nSo as long as I'm under warranty,\nas long as my hardware is functioning,\n\n204\n00:10:50.656 --> 00:10:53.110\nI don't necessarily\nhave a need to upgrade.\n\n205\n00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.480\nAnd I'm still getting updates from Apple.\n\n206\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.710\nSo they're sending you, I've got Mac OS\nhere running here on my laptop because I\n\n207\n00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.270\nmeet the hardware requirements.\n\n208\n00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.870\nThat's one of the really nice things about\ndealing with quality hardware is that\n\n209\n00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.000\nyou can upgrade when it fails, as opposed\nto upgrading when it get super slow.\n\n210\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.320\nBecause, in this case,\nit's not getting super slow, right?\n\n211\n00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.320\nIt's the same hardware specs.\n\n212\n00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:17.370\nAll right, so if we know that our\nhardware is up to snuff, right?\n\n213\n00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.957\nThen, we now know that we\ncan run Mac OS Sierra.\n\n214\n00:11:19.957 --> 00:11:23.409\nSo Wes' laptop can, my laptop can, in\nfact, we're both already running Sierra,\n\n215\n00:11:23.409 --> 00:11:24.585\nso that kinda gives it away.\n\n216\n00:11:24.585 --> 00:11:27.990\nBut I've got a Mac mini\nsitting here on the desk.\n\n217\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.210\nAnd if I wanna put Sierra on it,\nI would just need to double check, right?\n\n218\n00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.500\nFind the model number for it, or\n\n219\n00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.370\nthe friendly name, and\nmake sure it's on the list.\n\n220\n00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.492\nOr look at the amount of memory that\nit's got and the amount of disk space.\n\n221\n00:11:38.492 --> 00:11:41.547\n&gt;&gt; Don, when I think about installing\nan operating system from other vendors,\n\n222\n00:11:41.547 --> 00:11:44.602\nif you will, one of the things that I\nthink of is that there's a certain amount\n\n223\n00:11:44.602 --> 00:11:45.830\nof steps that you have to take.\n\n224\n00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.880\nAnd one of the things that always\ncomes up is backing the machine up,\n\n225\n00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.220\nmaking sure that you have that data\nprior to doing the installation.\n\n226\n00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.190\nBut Don, is that the only step?\n\n227\n00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.536\nAre there more steps, or is that\njust one of the steps in a handful?\n\n228\n00:11:57.536 --> 00:11:59.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, there's as many\nsteps as you want there to be.\n\n229\n00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.300\nBut Apple does have four recommended steps\nprior to upgrading any device, right?\n\n230\n00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.680\nAnd I keep saying upgrade, let me just\nkind of address that really quick.\n\n231\n00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.990\nWhen we wanna install Sierra,\nyou've actually got two choices.\n\n232\n00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.400\nYou can do an upgrade.\n\n233\n00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.630\nWhen you upgrade,\n\n234\n00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.560\nit replaces your existing operating\nsystem with Mac OS Sierra.\n\n235\n00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.054\nAnd by doing that, you keep all your\napplications, all of your documents,\n\n236\n00:12:20.054 --> 00:12:21.373\neverything stays the same.\n\n237\n00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:24.480\nYou're just running your new OS, and\nthat's what a lot of people will do.\n\n238\n00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.112\nBut if it's a brand new computer,\nor if it's junked up, and\n\n239\n00:12:27.112 --> 00:12:28.640\nyou wanna kind of reset it.\n\n240\n00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.674\nThe other option is instead of an upgrade,\nis to do a clean install,\n\n241\n00:12:31.674 --> 00:12:35.200\nwhere you format the hard drive,\nand you can start fresh and clean.\n\n242\n00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.988\nOn a positive side,\nyou know exactly what is on that system,\n\n243\n00:12:37.988 --> 00:12:39.860\nbecause you started with a fresh start.\n\n244\n00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.570\nAnd you don't have to\nworry about upgrades.\n\n245\n00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.630\nOn the negative side, you've gotta go and\nrestore all of your data.\n\n246\n00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.632\nSo be aware,\nthere's a little variation there.\n\n247\n00:12:45.632 --> 00:12:49.977\nBut regardless of which way you're going,\nupgrade or a clean install,\n\n248\n00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:53.710\nyou still wanna follow a couple of steps,\nright?\n\n249\n00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:59.160\nStep number one is you wanna make sure\nthat your device is fully updated, right?\n\n250\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.050\nThat if you're gonna do an upgrade,\nthen it's got to take settings from your\n\n251\n00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.800\nold operating system and\nbring them into the new operating system.\n\n252\n00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.360\nThere may have been updates for your older\noperating system that got it ready for\n\n253\n00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.210\nthe upgrade.\n\n254\n00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.180\nAnd that was definitely\ntrue of El Capitan.\n\n255\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.810\nEl Capitan, they pushed\nan update out right at the end,\n\n256\n00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:20.060\nright before Sierra came out, to make\nsure that Sierra's migration wizard can\n\n257\n00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.150\nhandle that properly and\nbring that data in.\n\n258\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.285\nSo we need to make sure that\nwe've done any available updates.\n\n259\n00:13:25.285 --> 00:13:27.480\nAnd updates on a Mac are super easy,\nright?\n\n260\n00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.320\nBecause all you have to do this\nis fire up your app store.\n\n261\n00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.794\nSo if I take my laptop, for example,\nand I fire up my app store,\n\n262\n00:13:33.794 --> 00:13:37.546\nI can see I've actually got an update\nthat I haven't done already.\n\n263\n00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:41.364\nWe can go in here and we can play video\ngames, or we can click on updates and\n\n264\n00:13:41.364 --> 00:13:43.630\nyou can see any update that's available.\n\n265\n00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.150\nSo I've got an update here for\nmy command line tools for Xcode.\n\n266\n00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.750\nWell, that's not really\ngonna impact my upgrade.\n\n267\n00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.170\nUnless I'm using Xcode and then I upgrade,\n\n268\n00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.320\nand Xcode is now broken\nuntil I do the update.\n\n269\n00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.762\nSo always best to do the update first,\nright?\n\n270\n00:13:56.762 --> 00:13:58.550\nSo that's number one, do your update.\n\n271\n00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:03.330\nNumber two,\nthink about all of your applications.\n\n272\n00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:08.540\nYou may have applications that aren't\nsupported under Sierra yet, right?\n\n273\n00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.550\nSo for example, I have a program\nthat I use called Forklift.\n\n274\n00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.320\nAnd Forklift is this\nlittle program right here.\n\n275\n00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.230\nIt's a dual pane file manager.\n\n276\n00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.740\nAnd when I launched it,\nit checked for updates.\n\n277\n00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.800\nI can see it's got\nan update that's out also.\n\n278\n00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.790\nAnd I might even see in here that they\nadd CRO support or something like that.\n\n279\n00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.460\nActually, it doesn't show it here, but\n\n280\n00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:33.980\nsoftware like this may not directly\nwork out of the box with Sierra.\n\n281\n00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.720\nThere may be some change in security or\nsomething that makes the program break.\n\n282\n00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.881\nSo you need to wait for that developer\nto update their application.\n\n283\n00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:42.515\nOtherwise when you upgrade to Sierra,\n\n284\n00:14:42.515 --> 00:14:45.160\nyou won't be able to run those\napplications anymore, right?\n\n285\n00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.380\nSo those are things that happen.\n\n286\n00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.140\nSo we need to look at our\nprimary applications,\n\n287\n00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.620\nour critical applications and\nmake sure that they support Sierra, right?\n\n288\n00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.356\nAnd if they have updates,\nwe need to do those updates as well.\n\n289\n00:14:54.356 --> 00:14:56.780\nAll right, step 3, we need to back up.\n\n290\n00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.390\nExactly what Wes said,\nyou need to back up your data.\n\n291\n00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.930\nNow, if you're using Time Machine,\nit's super easy, right?\n\n292\n00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:05.290\nYou can back up your entire device,\nincluding your data and\n\n293\n00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.000\nthe operating system.\n\n294\n00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.370\nYou can back up everything to\nan external media, and you're done.\n\n295\n00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.160\nBut if you're not using Time Machine,\nyou need to at least be copying your\n\n296\n00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.457\nfiles somewhere else,\nmaybe using a service like Dropbox.\n\n297\n00:15:14.457 --> 00:15:16.992\nOr you could just copy the CDs or\nfloppy disks,\n\n298\n00:15:16.992 --> 00:15:21.120\nwhatever the heck it is that you do,\n[LAUGH] hopefully not floppy disk.\n\n299\n00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.820\nBut back up your data,\nyou don't wanna lose any information.\n\n300\n00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.770\nWhen you do an upgrade,\nit's a relatively straightforward process.\n\n301\n00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:32.110\nBut newer versions of Mac OS have\nintroduced a lot of disk encryption,\n\n302\n00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.710\nand things can go wrong\nwith disk encryption.\n\n303\n00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.820\nAnd if that happens, you could\npotentially be locked out of your data.\n\n304\n00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.290\nAnd now you're out of luck, and\nyou'll wish you had that backup.\n\n305\n00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.320\nSo, backing up your system\nis kinda one piece.\n\n306\n00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.140\nAnd Apple actually\nbreaks this up into two.\n\n307\n00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:50.710\nThey say back up your system and\nthen also back up your settings.\n\n308\n00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.430\nNow, what do they mean by\nback up your settings?\n\n309\n00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.060\nWell, what if I'm gonna\ndo a clean install?\n\n310\n00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.330\nIf I do a clean install, I format the Mac.\n\n311\n00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.013\nAnd then I had something like\nMicrosoft Office installed, right.\n\n312\n00:16:02.013 --> 00:16:05.229\nAnd I had Word set up just the way I\nwanted it with a blue background instead\n\n313\n00:16:05.229 --> 00:16:06.300\nof a white background.\n\n314\n00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.540\nAnd all those other things.\n\n315\n00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.590\nWell, those are settings.\n\n316\n00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.090\nAnd backing up the Word application\nitself isn't enough, right.\n\n317\n00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.582\nCuz I can just go to Microsoft and\n\n318\n00:16:14.582 --> 00:16:16.742\ndownload Word again,\nthat's not a big deal.\n\n319\n00:16:16.742 --> 00:16:20.076\nBut the preferences I really\nneed to document those and\n\n320\n00:16:20.076 --> 00:16:23.350\nthere's not a great way to\nbackup preference files.\n\n321\n00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.200\nPreference files are p-list files and\nthey're stored in a hard drive,\n\n322\n00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.110\nyou can find them.\n\n323\n00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:31.230\nBut most applications really don't like\nit when you move those between systems.\n\n324\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.680\nSo, if you're doing a clean install it's\nbetter to document it by hand, right.\n\n325\n00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.980\nWrite down what your preferences were so\nthat when you bring your new fresh and\n\n326\n00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.050\nclean system back up you can then\nput those preferences back in.\n\n327\n00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:43.500\nYou can go in and\nchange those backgrounds,\n\n328\n00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.870\nget it put back the way it was.\n\n329\n00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.610\n&gt;&gt; So Don backing up those settings,\nit's all about making sure that you\n\n330\n00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.280\nkeep the system state, the concurrent\nconfiguration of the machine.\n\n331\n00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.130\nSo that you don't have to come back and\npeak and tweak all those little minute\n\n332\n00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.060\nsettings after you've reinstalled\nthe operating system.\n\n333\n00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it's easy to forget\nsome of the settings and\n\n334\n00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.950\nthen a month later you're like\nshoot this isn't set up right.\n\n335\n00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.800\nAnd you can't pull it back up,\nyou've got reinvent the wheel.\n\n336\n00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.790\nFigure out how you change some setting or\nwhatever, it becomes a challenge.\n\n337\n00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.790\nSo those are all things\nto think about there.\n\n338\n00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.520\nOnce you've gone through that process\nthough you're ready to do the install.\n\n339\n00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.110\nWell almost ready.\n\n340\n00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:19.740\nIf you're gonna install Sierra if it's\nan upgrade, it's actually really easy.\n\n341\n00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.900\nYou just go to the machine that you want\nto upgrade and you do the upgrade right?\n\n342\n00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.730\nSo if I take my machine for\nexample let me go back to my app store.\n\n343\n00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.660\nYou can take your machine, let's say\nyou're running El Capitan for example.\n\n344\n00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:35.670\nYou could fire up your app store and\nin the app store, you can just do a search\n\n345\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.830\nfor Sierra, and it'll usually be\nthe first thing that comes back.\n\n346\n00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.770\nIn fact, if you haven't upgraded,\nit'll probably be advertised right\n\n347\n00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.035\nthere on the home screen on the app store\nsaying hey, Sierra's out, by the way.\n\n348\n00:17:46.035 --> 00:17:49.510\n[LAUGH] And if it is,\nthen you can come over here and\n\n349\n00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:50.560\nyou'll have this button to click.\n\n350\n00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.770\nNow I'm already running Sierra,\nso mine says download.\n\n351\n00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:58.376\nIf you're not already running Sierra,\nthen it will say install, right,\n\n352\n00:17:58.376 --> 00:17:59.644\nthat's the difference.\n\n353\n00:17:59.644 --> 00:18:03.265\nAnd when you click install,\nit is going to download MacOS Sierra and\n\n354\n00:18:03.265 --> 00:18:07.230\nthen it's gonna start the upgrade\nprocess for your Mac, right?\n\n355\n00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.010\nNow what if this isn't\nthe Mac I'm upgrading?\n\n356\n00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:13.740\nIn fact, I already said,\nI'm running Sierra on my laptop already.\n\n357\n00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.240\nI want to upgrade this\nMac Mini sitting beside me.\n\n358\n00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.950\nIt's running El Capitan, right.\n\n359\n00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:21.290\nSo, if I wanna upgrade this other device,\nand\n\n360\n00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:24.030\nI don't necessarily have internet access,\nright.\n\n361\n00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.450\nI don't wanna have that kind of access or\nI want to do a clean install,\n\n362\n00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:27.059\nnot an upgrade.\n\n363\n00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.110\nWell, then I don't wanna install\nthrough the app store like this.\n\n364\n00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:35.730\nInstead, I wanna build\na bootable USB media,\n\n365\n00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:41.580\na disk that has MacOS Sierra on it,\nthat I can boot this Mac Mini up off of,\n\n366\n00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.650\nand install it on there, and\nget the system up to date, right?\n\n367\n00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.100\nSo what we can do,\nis you can go to any other Mac.\n\n368\n00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.150\nGo to any Mac that's running\nMac OS 10.7.5 or higher.\n\n369\n00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.400\nAnd on that Mac, you'd go in the App Store\nand you can hit that download button and\n\n370\n00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.920\nit'll download the MAC Sierra installer.\n\n371\n00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.263\nNow it's gonna download it and I believe\nit's a little over four gigs in size so\n\n372\n00:19:01.263 --> 00:19:02.033\nit takes a while.\n\n373\n00:19:02.033 --> 00:19:07.020\nIt'll take 20 minutes, well it depends on\nyour bandwidth, it takes me 20 minutes.\n\n374\n00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.830\nOnce it's downloaded,\nthen you can make your USB media.\n\n375\n00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.690\nNow if you haven't upgraded this machine,\nwhen you download it,\n\n376\n00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.650\nit's then gonna offer to install.\n\n377\n00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.480\nAnd you can just say cancel, you say\ncancel, I don't want install, right?\n\n378\n00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.392\nAnd what it's doing,\nI'll show you, it downloads it and\n\n379\n00:19:21.392 --> 00:19:24.120\nit's putting it in your\nApplications folder.\n\n380\n00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.610\nSo if I go into my Applications folder and\n\n381\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.350\nI browse around in here,\nthere we go, install macOS Sierra.\n\n382\n00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.870\nThat's what it's doing.\n\n383\n00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.640\nIt's downloading that file and\ndropping it on there, okay?\n\n384\n00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.649\nAnd once it's there, if you pull\nup the information on that file,\n\n385\n00:19:39.649 --> 00:19:42.958\nyou can see that it is 4.7 gigs,\nI was pretty close.\n\n386\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:46.012\n4.7 gigs in size,\nthat is the Mac OS Installer,\n\n387\n00:19:46.012 --> 00:19:49.776\nand if I double click on it,\nit's gonna start the installation\n\n388\n00:19:49.776 --> 00:19:54.010\nprocess which I don't wanna do\nbecause I'm already running Sierra.\n\n389\n00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:58.790\nI wanna build USB key that I can boot off\nof that I'm gonna install it from, right?\n\n390\n00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.960\nSo, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna drop,\nwell, actually,\n\n391\n00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.100\nI'm gonna get this USB key ready first and\nthen we'll drop to a terminal and\n\n392\n00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.590\nactually get this thing set up to boot,\nright.\n\n393\n00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.990\nIf you wanna build bootable media, first\nthing is you need some removable media.\n\n394\n00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.700\nAny USB drive will work,\nit can be a USB hard drive or\n\n395\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.570\nit can be a little thumb drive\nlike what I've got right here.\n\n396\n00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:22.365\nThese are super cheap, $15 on Amazon or\nsomething you can get these.\n\n397\n00:20:22.365 --> 00:20:25.603\nIt does need to be eight gigs or larger.\n\n398\n00:20:25.603 --> 00:20:29.005\nWe are starting to find with these Mac OS\ninstalls are getting bigger and bigger, so\n\n399\n00:20:29.005 --> 00:20:30.675\nI usually recommend a 16 gig.\n\n400\n00:20:30.675 --> 00:20:35.575\nYou can get a 16 gig USB drive easily for\nunder $20 just about anywhere, but\n\n401\n00:20:35.575 --> 00:20:36.945\nan 8 gig will work.\n\n402\n00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:41.445\nA 4 gig will not work and 4 gigs are what\nthey normally give away at trade shows and\n\n403\n00:20:41.445 --> 00:20:43.600\nconventions, so\nwe had a ton of 4 gig ones.\n\n404\n00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.060\nBut the MacOS Sierra installer\nis over 4 gigs in size, so\n\n405\n00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.030\nthose won't work,\nyou need it to be a little bit larger.\n\n406\n00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.321\nThen we need to prepare the drive.\n\n407\n00:20:52.321 --> 00:20:53.475\nI don't know what's on this drive,\n\n408\n00:20:53.475 --> 00:20:55.350\nactually I think it's got like\na Linux installation on it.\n\n409\n00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:59.950\nSo I need to erase this drive and\nget it ready to become a MacOS installer.\n\n410\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:04.230\nSo I'm gonna plug this\ninto my computer and\n\n411\n00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.560\nthen on my computer I'm gonna\nfire up the Disk Utility.\n\n412\n00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.380\nSo if you just use your, I mean you can\nbrowse through the application folder.\n\n413\n00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.100\nI always use Spotlight, and\nI'm gonna fire up my Disk Utility.\n\n414\n00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.720\nAnd I'll see that USB key, there it is.\n\n415\n00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.850\nAnd it's actually showing ESD-USB so\nit's a Windows install on there.\n\n416\n00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.300\nWe're definitely aren't gonna\ninstall that on our Mac.\n\n417\n00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.650\nSo I need to just erase\nthat drive real quick.\n\n418\n00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.280\nSo I'm gonna hit Erase.\n\n419\n00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.200\nAnd I'm gonna erase it.\n\n420\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.910\nI'll make it Mac OS Extended (journaled).\n\n421\n00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.160\nAnd It's set for\na master boot record, which is fine.\n\n422\n00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.210\nYou'll see there's a few other options\nlike GUID and Apple partition map.\n\n423\n00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:39.860\nMaster boot record is really what\nyou want because every new Mac\n\n424\n00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:44.160\nuses the EFI standards, and\nEFI needs to see a regular MBR on it,\n\n425\n00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.950\nnot one of the other crazy ones.\n\n426\n00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.780\nIn the name I'll leave it untitled,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n427\n00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.320\nIt's gonna get renamed in a minute.\n\n428\n00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.700\nIt's gonna get formatted again,\nbefore we're done.\n\n429\n00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.310\nBut it's a good idea to erase this,\nbecause some systems\n\n430\n00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.920\nwill partition out media, and\nthe partitions can be a problem.\n\n431\n00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.540\nIn fact, see how I just got\nthis failure right here?\n\n432\n00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.340\nWell, the reason it's failing\nis because of partitions.\n\n433\n00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.330\nWindows actually puts more\nthan partition on there.\n\n434\n00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.600\nI know we only see one here,\n\n435\n00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.700\non the screen, but\nthere is actually more than one.\n\n436\n00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.390\nAnd see how it said it was unmounting,\nand it couldn't open the device?\n\n437\n00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:17.020\nWell, if you just hit done and erase\nit again, I know it's kinda silly, but\n\n438\n00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.510\nit's actually gonna work the second time,\nthere it goes.\n\n439\n00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.080\nAnd the reason was,\nit unmounted one partition.\n\n440\n00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.340\nIt hadn't unmounted the other one,\nand so it just took it a second time.\n\n441\n00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.447\nSo if that ever happens to you,\njust erase it again and you'll get by it.\n\n442\n00:22:29.447 --> 00:22:33.992\nAll right, so now I've got a 16\ngig USB key that is erased and\n\n443\n00:22:33.992 --> 00:22:38.570\nready to go,\nto become a MacOS Sierra installer.\n\n444\n00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.210\nAll right, so\nnow I'm gonna fire up a terminal.\n\n445\n00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:44.000\nSo I'm just gonna use my Spotlight\nagain here, and pull up terminal.\n\n446\n00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.340\nAnd in my terminal, I'm gonna\nbrowse to my Applications folder.\n\n447\n00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.780\nSo I'm gonna do cd /Applications.\n\n448\n00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.060\nAnd let me resize this window a little\nbit, cuz the command I'm gonna run here in\n\n449\n00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.780\na minute is really, really long and\nit'll wrap around the screen a bit.\n\n450\n00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.210\nSo I'm just gonna kinda\nchange my sizing here.\n\n451\n00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:06.230\nAll right, so in my Applications folder,\nif I take a look, I mean,\n\n452\n00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.560\nyou see all the various\napplications that we've got.\n\n453\n00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.180\nAnd the one that I'm looking for\nis this Install macOS Sierra.\n\n454\n00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.910\nSo I know that i have got it,\n\n455\n00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:18.630\nit is in /applications/installMacOSSierra,\nso that's is my installer.\n\n456\n00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.120\nThat is the first thing I needed.\n\n457\n00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.310\nThe other thing I need is my USB drive.\n\n458\n00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.556\nNow, my USB drive should\nbe mounted under volumes.\n\n459\n00:23:25.556 --> 00:23:28.420\nInside of volumes you'll see\nall of your hard drives and so\n\n460\n00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.840\ni can see like Macintosh HD,\nmy main hard drive.\n\n461\n00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.290\nMobile back ups which is actually\na Virtual Storage for time machine.\n\n462\n00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.150\nAnd then I've got untitled.\n\n463\n00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:41.320\nThat's my recently erased USB key.\n\n464\n00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.070\nSo now, what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna tell the system to go ahead and\n\n465\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.540\ncopy the Mac OS installer to that USB kit.\n\n466\n00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.390\nIt's not as easy as just dragging\nthe file and dropping it there.\n\n467\n00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:55.422\nBecause I need the USB key to be bootable,\nthat's the hard part, right?\n\n468\n00:23:55.422 --> 00:23:57.087\nI've gotta be able to boot off this disk,\nso\n\n469\n00:23:57.087 --> 00:23:59.390\nit has to have boot\nrecord information on it.\n\n470\n00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.130\nFortunately, Apple\nprovides us with a script.\n\n471\n00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.592\nThat can do that.\n\n472\n00:24:02.592 --> 00:24:07.812\nThe only problem is the script is\nactually inside the Mac OS installer so\n\n473\n00:24:07.812 --> 00:24:11.040\nhow we kind of launch\nit is a little strange.\n\n474\n00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.860\nLet me show you, so first off I need\nto run this as an administrator.\n\n475\n00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.580\nSo I've got to do a SUDO right?\n\n476\n00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.360\nThat's super user do.\n\n477\n00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.560\nSo I'm doing an action as the root user.\n\n478\n00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.630\nNormally when you perform an administrator\naction it prompts you for a username and\n\n479\n00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:26.550\npassword right?\n\n480\n00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.180\nSo SUDO is saying I need to\ndo this as an administrator.\n\n481\n00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:35.230\nThen I need to point it\nto the installer and\n\n482\n00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.470\ntab auto complete is\nyour friend here right?\n\n483\n00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:41.350\nSo typing these names out is really hard\nespecially when the names have spaces,\n\n484\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.250\nbecause you have to do a back\nslash to kind of escape out any\n\n485\n00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.430\nspace that you've got.\n\n486\n00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:50.900\nSo I need to run\n/Application/InstallmacOSSierra.app.\n\n487\n00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.710\nAnd see by pressing tab on my keyboard,\nI just typed Install, and\n\n488\n00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.370\nthe rest of it typed itself out and\nmade it a lot easier.\n\n489\n00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.300\nSo I'm reaching inside\nof that application, and\n\n490\n00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.440\ninside of it,\nthere's a folder called Contents.\n\n491\n00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.820\nAnd inside of that,\nthere's a folder called Resources.\n\n492\n00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:12.085\nAnd inside of that is a script\ncalled Create Install Media,\n\n493\n00:25:12.085 --> 00:25:14.940\nright, and it's really long.\n\n494\n00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.613\nI'll put this command in the show notes so\nyou guys don't have to worry about jotting\n\n495\n00:25:18.613 --> 00:25:21.109\nit right down right now but\nthis is only half the command.\n\n496\n00:25:21.109 --> 00:25:22.920\nWe still have a lot more to go.\n\n497\n00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.810\nSo I'm basically reaching\ninto that folder and\n\n498\n00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:29.800\nrunning the Create Install Media script,\nokay.\n\n499\n00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.160\nNext, I need to tell it what I'm doing.\n\n500\n00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:36.378\nAnd what I'm doing is I am\ncreating an install media.\n\n501\n00:25:36.378 --> 00:25:38.040\nSo I need to tell it\nwhat media I'm gonna use.\n\n502\n00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:43.355\nSo I'll say --volume, and\nI've screen wrapped here.\n\n503\n00:25:43.355 --> 00:25:49.315\nBut it's --volume and I'm gonna point it\nto the volume that I've got ready for\n\n504\n00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:53.363\nit, which in my case is /volume/untitled,\nright?\n\n505\n00:25:53.363 --> 00:25:54.254\nCuz I didn't give it a name.\n\n506\n00:25:54.254 --> 00:25:56.757\nIf I had given it a name,\nI'd type whatever that name was here, but\n\n507\n00:25:56.757 --> 00:25:57.980\nmine's just call untitled.\n\n508\n00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.880\nIt's cuz we erased it.\n\n509\n00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.780\nAll right, then I need to tell it\nwhere the Mac OS installer is,\n\n510\n00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.970\nand I know this is kind of funny cuz the\nscript is inside of the installer, right?\n\n511\n00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.370\nBut I need to tell it where\nthe installer actually resides, and so\n\n512\n00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:20.020\nthis is gonna seem a little redundant,\nbut I'm gonna say --application path.\n\n513\n00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:28.959\nAnd then I'm gonna point it to\n/applications/installMacOsSierra.app.\n\n514\n00:26:28.959 --> 00:26:32.670\nAll right, this time I'm not going to\npoint to anything inside of it, though.\n\n515\n00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:36.030\nI'm just pointing to\nthe actual application.\n\n516\n00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:39.225\nAnd then, last I'm gonna add one\nmore thing here to the end which is\n\n517\n00:26:39.225 --> 00:26:42.250\n--nointeraction.\n\n518\n00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.890\nThere's actually a couple of questions\nthat can pop up when you build a media,\n\n519\n00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.110\nlike it asks you to accept license and\nall that.\n\n520\n00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.550\nAnd by saying no interaction, I'm\ntelling it, hey, don't ask me questions.\n\n521\n00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:55.930\nJust build the media and\nget it done, so --nointeraction.\n\n522\n00:26:55.930 --> 00:27:00.370\nAnd when I run that, it's going to ask\nme for my password, because I use SUDO,\n\n523\n00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.230\nbecause I'm running this\nas an administrator.\n\n524\n00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.110\nI've gotta give it that permission,\nand here it goes.\n\n525\n00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.810\nNow, it's erasing the disk.\n\n526\n00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:08.590\nAnd you might ask yourself,\n\n527\n00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:12.220\nwell Don, didn't we waste our time\nerasing the disk a minute ago?\n\n528\n00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.830\nAnd the short answer here is no.\n\n529\n00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.550\nIt's erasing the disk,\nit's not repartitioning it, right?\n\n530\n00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.860\nSo if there were extra partitions,\nwhat we did would've wiped those out.\n\n531\n00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.884\nThis is just kind of erasing\nwhat's already there, so\n\n532\n00:27:21.884 --> 00:27:23.560\nit's making sure it's in the right format.\n\n533\n00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.684\nIt's gonna change it's name so\nwon't be called untitled anymore right,\n\n534\n00:27:27.684 --> 00:27:30.370\nnow it's gonna be called something else.\n\n535\n00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:33.330\nAnd now it's copying\nthe files to the disk.\n\n536\n00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:37.251\nNow this copy operation it can take\na while right, I've got a USB3\n\n537\n00:27:37.251 --> 00:27:41.609\nthumb drive here and it's plugging in\none of the USB3 ports on my laptop.\n\n538\n00:27:41.609 --> 00:27:44.770\nSo, it shouldn't take too long,\nmaybe four or five minutes.\n\n539\n00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:47.890\nBut, if you're on USB 2.0,\nthis can take half an hour.\n\n540\n00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:50.800\nIt could take a long time, so, be patient.\n\n541\n00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.035\nKickback, relax, twiddle your thumbs, take\nup a hobby, or whatever it is that you do.\n\n542\n00:27:55.035 --> 00:27:59.900\nAnd when it's done, you'll now have a USB\nkey that you can use to boot up, really,\n\n543\n00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.850\nany Mac, and\nstart the MacOS Sierra install.\n\n544\n00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:06.340\nYou can do upgrades and\nclean installs from this USB key.\n\n545\n00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.460\nIt's a great idea to have\none of these on hand,\n\n546\n00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:14.350\nbecause Apple doesn't ship install media\nwith any device anymore, no device, right?\n\n547\n00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.140\nSo it doesn't matter whether\nyou're buying a laptop,\n\n548\n00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.200\na desktop, any of them, they don't\ncome with the DVDs like they used to.\n\n549\n00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.510\nSo this is the only way that we\ncan get media to do the install.\n\n550\n00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.760\nIt's a good idea to have at\nleast one of these on hand.\n\n551\n00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.632\nAnd we'll even talk about it in later\nepisodes about how truly useful to\n\n552\n00:28:28.632 --> 00:28:29.800\ntroubleshooting too.\n\n553\n00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.330\nIf you think you have a failed hard drive,\n\n554\n00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.430\nhow are you gonna boot your system up and\ncheck?\n\n555\n00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:38.710\nWell, you could boot off of a USB key and\nthen access the diagnostic utilities and\n\n556\n00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.460\ntest the hard drive, erase the hard drive,\nsee if that fixes it.\n\n557\n00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.790\nBut if you don't have that media to boot\nfrom, you're gonna be out of luck, right.\n\n558\n00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.790\nSo definitely something that\nyou want to have handy.\n\n559\n00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.060\n&gt;&gt; Lot of great information there Don.\n\n560\n00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.594\nWe're gonna have to have an operating\nsystem if we're gonna support it, so\n\n561\n00:28:52.594 --> 00:28:53.791\nthanks for helping us get started.\n\n562\n00:28:53.791 --> 00:28:55.069\nBut looking at the time clock,\n\n563\n00:28:55.069 --> 00:28:57.932\nit does look like we've come to\nthe end of another great episode Don.\n\n564\n00:28:57.932 --> 00:29:00.669\nBut before we do when it\ncomes to getting started for\n\n565\n00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:04.760\nthe first time in our Mac Sierra\nhere do you got any parting words?\n\n566\n00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.480\n&gt;&gt; All right well, you know,\nremember what we saw in this episode.\n\n567\n00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.616\nWe got a chance to see figuring out\nwhether our equipment could even support\n\n568\n00:29:09.616 --> 00:29:12.168\nMac OS Sierra and then we built\nthe install media for Sierra.\n\n569\n00:29:12.168 --> 00:29:14.620\nIt's still running here in\nthe background it'll be done eventually.\n\n570\n00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.720\nWhat we're gonna do in the next\nepisode is we're gonna pick up right\n\n571\n00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.580\nhere where we left off.\n\n572\n00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.090\nWe're gonna take this install media and\n\n573\n00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.560\nwe're actually gonna install\nMac OS Sierra on a system.\n\n574\n00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.400\nSo I know we're kind of leaving you\nhanging here in this episode but\n\n575\n00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.720\nit all falls in place, right?\n\n576\n00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.750\nThese are all the early setup steps.\n\n577\n00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.780\nIn the next episode we'll\nactually get to the true install.\n\n578\n00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.890\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's a great\nplace to call this one a wrap.\n\n579\n00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.040\nWe appreciate it as always,\nDon, you being with us.\n\n580\n00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.990\nAnd we appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n581\n00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.330\nSigning out for\nITPro.TV I've been your

thanks for\ntuning in.\n\n6\n00:00:15.393 --> 00:00:17.060\nWe gotta great show for you today.\n\n7\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.104\nWe're gonna be looking at the Apple\ncertified support professional.\n\n8\n00:00:20.104 --> 00:00:23.035\nAnd joining us back in the studio is\nnone other than is mister Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:24.465\nDon, how are we doing to day, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:25.415\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:25.415 --> 00:00:27.115\nReady to dive back in and\n\n12\n00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:31.410\nresolve the cliff hanger on the ending\nthat we left on that last episode, right?\n\n13\n00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.500\n&gt;&gt; If you didn't watch last episode,\n\n14\n00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.100\nwe talked about how to make sure that\nour hardware supported MacOS Sierra.\n\n15\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.517\nAnd all the steps we needed to go through\nto get ready to do the MacOS Sierra\n\n16\n00:00:40.517 --> 00:00:41.199\ndeployment.\n\n17\n00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.455\nAnd we ended the episode by building\na USB installer for MacOS Sierra.\n\n18\n00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:48.930\nSo I left that running right\nthere at the end of the episode.\n\n19\n00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.790\nAnd it took about 10 minutes.\n\n20\n00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.219\nAnd once it was done I now\nhave this USB key, right?\n\n21\n00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.420\nAll I did was pop it out of my laptop and\nthat's it.\n\n22\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.470\nSo now we're gonna take this USB key and\nwe're actually gonna use it, right?\n\n23\n00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.750\nWe're gonna stick it into a machine and\nperform the Sierra update.\n\n24\n00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.379\nAll right, now I've got a Mac Mini sitting\non the table here in front of me and\n\n25\n00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:10.573\nI pulled this from one of our back\nclosets before the show started.\n\n26\n00:01:10.573 --> 00:01:14.210\nI actually don't know much about\nthis Mac Mini really at all.\n\n27\n00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.710\nSo I don't trust a machine\nthat I didn't set up myself so\n\n28\n00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.590\nI want to erase it and get a good,\nclean installation on there.\n\n29\n00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.911\nWell if it was running El Capitan,\nor Yosemite, or whatever,\n\n30\n00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:28.992\nI could fire up the app store and\ndo the in-place upgrade.\n\n31\n00:01:28.992 --> 00:01:30.079\nNo big deal, right?\n\n32\n00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.230\nYou go into the app store,\nyou click install and you upgrade.\n\n33\n00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.900\nBut because I don't trust this machine,\nI want to erase it.\n\n34\n00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.080\nI want it to be good and clean and a nice\nfresh start, and I want it to be Sierra.\n\n35\n00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.890\nAnd that's why I need this USB installer,\nright?\n\n36\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.342\nSo, if you didn't watch the last episode,\n\n37\n00:01:45.342 --> 00:01:47.399\nI show you how to build that USB\ninstaller in the last episode.\n\n38\n00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.571\nBut in this episode,\nwe're gonna take this USB installer and\n\n39\n00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:53.450\nwe're actually gonna put it to use,\nput it to work.\n\n40\n00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.340\nSo that's what we're starting\noff here in this episode.\n\n41\n00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.181\nSo I'm gonna take this USB installer and\njust install it into my Mac mini here.\n\n42\n00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:03.350\nAnd if we watch, the Mac mini is gonna\nrecognize that and it's gonna mount it.\n\n43\n00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.469\nNow, depending on how you're set up,\nit may or may not show up on your desktop.\n\n44\n00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.705\nAnd I'll see mine's prompting me\nabout doing some updates here so\n\n45\n00:02:09.705 --> 00:02:11.920\nI'm gonna ignore that for right now.\n\n46\n00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.020\nBut if we take a look at it I can see\nI've got this install Mac OS Sierra.\n\n47\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.104\nThat's what it renamed my USB key\nto at the end of the last episode.\n\n48\n00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:21.501\nSo that install disk if we browse into it,\n\n49\n00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:25.539\nit's basically got the installation file,\nand it looks like, hey,\n\n50\n00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:29.920\nwe just drag-and-dropped the installer\nright here onto the media.\n\n51\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.564\nBut it actually made it\na bootable partition also, so\n\n52\n00:02:32.564 --> 00:02:34.694\nit's ready to boot right off of this disk.\n\n53\n00:02:34.694 --> 00:02:38.865\nNow, in order to do a nice fresh and\nclean install,\n\n54\n00:02:38.865 --> 00:02:41.590\nI need to boot off of this USB key.\n\n55\n00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.729\nAnd there's two ways to do that.\n\n56\n00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:48.317\nOne way is, if I have access to\nthe system like I do right here,\n\n57\n00:02:48.317 --> 00:02:53.320\nthen what I can do is,\nI can go into my system preferences.\n\n58\n00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.830\nAnd in your system preference,\nyou'll see where you can pick a boot disk.\n\n59\n00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.359\nWhen you look inside of your\nsystem preferences in here,\n\n60\n00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.048\nyou've got an option where you can specify\nby which disk you're going to boot off of\n\n61\n00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:06.328\nwhen the computer comes up.\n\n62\n00:03:06.328 --> 00:03:10.686\nSo you've got start up disk right here,\nand inside of start up disk,\n\n63\n00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:15.650\nyou'll see each of the devices that\nare attached and you can choose it.\n\n64\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.365\nWell, if you build your media\non a disk and is supported,\n\n65\n00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.470\nit'll show up in here and\nyou can choose it.\n\n66\n00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.350\nAnd mine's not showing up, all right?\n\n67\n00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.200\nWhy is that?\n\n68\n00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.700\nWell, because it's not an official\nApple supported USB cable apparently.\n\n69\n00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.310\nIf it was,\nit would show up here in the list and\n\n70\n00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.490\nI could just click on my USB key and\nI can hit Restart.\n\n71\n00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.537\nNow, mine's not showing up,\nso am I out of luck?\n\n72\n00:03:36.537 --> 00:03:37.700\nNo.\n\n73\n00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.820\nI just have to go about it\na slightly different way.\n\n74\n00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.810\nIf your disk doesn't show up here,\nthen you can't do the easy,\n\n75\n00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.460\nautomated way to tell it to restart.\n\n76\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.410\nInstead, what you're gonna\nhave to do is shut down and\n\n77\n00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.470\nwhen you boot up the Mac if you hold\nthe option key on your keyboard,\n\n78\n00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.860\nwhile you're holding the option\nkey it'll display a boot menu.\n\n79\n00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.530\nAnd it'll show your hard drive and\nany removable media alongside it.\n\n80\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.835\nRight here on this screen I'm\nonly seeing my hard drive but\n\n81\n00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:06.626\nwhen I get to my options screen here\nin a minute, we'll see a lot more.\n\n82\n00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:08.970\nAll right, so\nthat's what I'm gonna have to do.\n\n83\n00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.130\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna turn my Mac off.\n\n84\n00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.071\nNow when I do that, because of\nthe way I share my screen and stuff,\n\n85\n00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:17.408\nit's gonna make the screen go blank,\nwhich kind of makes sense, right?\n\n86\n00:04:17.408 --> 00:04:19.771\nSo, [LAUGH] I'm shutting it down.\n\n87\n00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:21.490\nSo we'll shut this one down.\n\n88\n00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.240\nAnd after it's shut down,\nmy screen's gonna blank out, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.900\nSo I'm gonna get a blank screen,\nvery exciting.\n\n90\n00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.490\nAnd I'm gonna hold down\noption on my keyboard.\n\n91\n00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.345\nNow, one thing I do wanna point out is\nI've got a wireless keyboard, right.\n\n92\n00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:37.440\nBut the fun part here\nis it actually works.\n\n93\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.920\nThe wireless connectivity on\nthe wireless keyboard is Bluetooth but\n\n94\n00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.742\nit connects even before\nthe operating system fires up.\n\n95\n00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:47.470\nSo I'm gonna hold down\nthe option key here.\n\n96\n00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.960\nAnd I'm gonna push power\nbutton on my Mac and\n\n97\n00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.130\nI just heard the Mac tone, so\nI know that it's starting up.\n\n98\n00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.445\nI'm holding down the option key, so\nit's gonna start the boot process and\n\n99\n00:04:57.445 --> 00:05:01.248\nI'm not gonna see much on my screen right\naway while it's starting the boot process.\n\n100\n00:05:01.248 --> 00:05:05.440\nBut then, I'm gonna get this.\n\n101\n00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.330\nNormally when you boot,\nyou see the Apple logo,\n\n102\n00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.630\nand there's a little status bar\nthat goes across the bottom, right?\n\n103\n00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.120\nWell here,\nit's not gotten to that point yet.\n\n104\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.290\nWhen you see the Apple logo and\n\n105\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.990\nthe status bar moving, that means it's\nalready booting the operating system.\n\n106\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.318\nBecause I held the option button,\nI see the boot options, so\n\n107\n00:05:21.318 --> 00:05:24.854\nI can pick which drive I wanna boot from,\nand I see three drives.\n\n108\n00:05:24.854 --> 00:05:29.260\nNow that's interesting, because a minute\nago, I had the Macintosh hard drive.\n\n109\n00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.580\nAnd I know I added my USB key.\n\n110\n00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.660\nWhat the heck is the third option?\n\n111\n00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.740\nWell, what you're gonna see is\nyour main hard drive, right?\n\n112\n00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.042\nSo Mac HD, whatever,\nwe expect to see that one, right?\n\n113\n00:05:40.042 --> 00:05:44.270\nAnd then next to it is\na recovery partition.\n\n114\n00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.240\nNow, you should have a recovery\npartition on your Mac.\n\n115\n00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.509\nThere's really only one or two scenarios\nwhere you might be missing it.\n\n116\n00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.430\nScenario one, is your hard drive failed,\nand so you just put in a new hard drive.\n\n117\n00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.060\nA brand new hard drive is\ngonna be completely blank.\n\n118\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.050\nIt won't have a recovery partition on it,\nand so it won't show up.\n\n119\n00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.390\nBut it also won't show up as a bootable\noption, cuz it's completely blank.\n\n120\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.450\nSo both of these would be missing.\n\n121\n00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.148\nThe other option though, is where somebody\nelse may have erased the Mac, in the past.\n\n122\n00:06:12.148 --> 00:06:15.859\nAnd when they erased it,\nthey may not have known to leave room for\n\n123\n00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:19.250\nthe recovery partition, and\nso one didn't get created.\n\n124\n00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.070\nAnd so you might just see Macintosh HD and\nyour USB drive, and that's it.\n\n125\n00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.164\nYou might not see a recovery partition.\n\n126\n00:06:25.164 --> 00:06:28.620\nNow what is a recovery partition?\n\n127\n00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.170\nWell, we're about to boot off this\nUSB key and when I boot off of it,\n\n128\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.710\nit's gonna load a miniature version of MAC\nOS, not the full blown version of MAC OS,\n\n129\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.590\njust a small version of it, all right.\n\n130\n00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.557\nAnd when it boots that\nsmall version of it,\n\n131\n00:06:40.557 --> 00:06:44.550\nI can then take actions like repairing the\nMAC, diagnosing problems, formatting and\n\n132\n00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.754\ninstalling MAC OS,\nall those things, right.\n\n133\n00:06:46.754 --> 00:06:50.662\nAnd that's great if I have a USB key but\nwhat if I don't have a USB key?\n\n134\n00:06:50.662 --> 00:06:55.270\nWell Apple creates a recovery partition\nright there on the hard drive too.\n\n135\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.351\nSo I can always boot to that and\n\n136\n00:06:56.351 --> 00:06:58.614\nuse it right off of the hard drive\nwithout a removal of a media.\n\n137\n00:06:58.614 --> 00:07:01.440\nThat doesn't help me if\nthe hard drive fails though.\n\n138\n00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.260\nIf the hard drive fails I\ncan't boot off of that, right?\n\n139\n00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.940\nSo it's always a good idea to have more\nthan one way to get to recovery and\n\n140\n00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.157\nthere's a few different ways.\n\n141\n00:07:09.157 --> 00:07:12.824\nThe USB Key method is the one that I\nnormally use cuz I know I can keep\n\n142\n00:07:12.824 --> 00:07:13.770\na USB Key handy.\n\n143\n00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.290\nAnd even if the hard drive fails,\nI know that'll work.\n\n144\n00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.016\nBut, pretty much every Mac\nmade in the last five years,\n\n145\n00:07:19.016 --> 00:07:21.524\nalso supports what's\ncalled Internet recovery.\n\n146\n00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:22.415\nNotice on mine,\n\n147\n00:07:22.415 --> 00:07:27.350\nI see these three options and then right\nbeneath it I've got this Choose Network.\n\n148\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.890\nRight?\n\n149\n00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:33.530\nAnd if I drop that down, it's finding\nwireless networks that are nearby okay?\n\n150\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.380\nAnd I can take one of these wireless\nnetworks, like I'll take our guest\n\n151\n00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:43.815\nnetwork, and I can punch in a password,\nwhich, do I know our password?\n\n152\n00:07:43.815 --> 00:07:48.150\n[LAUGH] That's gonna be the real\nchallenge, is do I know the password.\n\n153\n00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.380\nAnd I can punch in the password and it's\ngonna connect to the wireless network.\n\n154\n00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.500\nNow assuming that it's got\nInternet connectivity,\n\n155\n00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.920\nI'll see another option appear.\n\n156\n00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.600\nIt'll be a little globe, right?\n\n157\n00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.614\nWhich is symbolizing the Internet.\n\n158\n00:07:57.614 --> 00:08:01.734\nNow I'm not sure if I typed\nin the right password or not.\n\n159\n00:08:01.734 --> 00:08:02.598\nI don't know if I'm gonna connect.\n\n160\n00:08:02.598 --> 00:08:05.407\nBut if I did,\nI would see a little globe here.\n\n161\n00:08:05.407 --> 00:08:09.111\nNow, internet connection or\ninternet recovery is really,\n\n162\n00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:14.660\nreally handy, if you don't have on board\nrecovery and you don't have a USB key.\n\n163\n00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.550\nBut it should be your last resort and\nthe reason I say it's your\n\n164\n00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.300\nlast resort is that the recovery\npartitions about 800 megs.\n\n165\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.418\nSo if I choose internet recovery.\n\n166\n00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:26.660\nIt is the download 800 megs of data.\n\n167\n00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.880\nThen it's gotta load it into RAM.\n\n168\n00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.100\nNow that's not a big deal,\nevery MAC has more than 800 megs of RAM,\n\n169\n00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.630\nthey got way more than that.\n\n170\n00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.519\nBut it just takes time, it's slow so it,\n\n171\n00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:38.195\nit's should be your last option\nusing internet recovery.\n\n172\n00:08:38.195 --> 00:08:41.485\nSo I'm not connecting right now, but I'm\nnot worried about it cuz I don't wanna use\n\n173\n00:08:41.485 --> 00:08:43.845\nthat method unless I absolutely have to.\n\n174\n00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:46.955\nSo instead, I've got a perfectly\nvalid recovery partition\n\n175\n00:08:46.955 --> 00:08:50.905\nright here on my own hard driver that\nI could use or I can use my USB drive.\n\n176\n00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:54.035\nNow, if I wanna do a fresh and\nclean version,\n\n177\n00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:58.430\ninstall of Sierra I wanna make\nsure I'm using my USB key.\n\n178\n00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.580\nIf I use the onboard recovery,\nyou can do a fresh and\n\n179\n00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.580\nclean install of whatever version\nof MacOS that device shipped with.\n\n180\n00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.985\nAnd it might have shipped\nwith EL Capitan or Yosemite,\n\n181\n00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:09.970\nMaverick who knows what right?\n\n182\n00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.500\nI wanna make sure that it's Sierra.\n\n183\n00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.490\nSo I need to make sure that I\nchoose to boot from my USB drive\n\n184\n00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.430\nto do this install, right?\n\n185\n00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:22.160\nAnd when I do the install, it'll\nactually upgrade that recovery partition\n\n186\n00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.830\nto make sure the onboard recovery\nnow matches what we're installing so\n\n187\n00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.870\nthat it's got the up to date\nversion on that, right?\n\n188\n00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.130\nSo I'm gonna choose my USB key.\n\n189\n00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.400\nAnd I'll just hit Enter.\n\n190\n00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.780\nAnd it's gonna start\nbooting off of that key.\n\n191\n00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.080\nSo now I see the apple and\n\n192\n00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.730\neventually I'll see the little status\nbar as it starts to boot that.\n\n193\n00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.400\nAnd it's gonna boot into,\nwell the same thing as recovery, right?\n\n194\n00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.120\nReally, booting off the install media and\nbooting to recovery are identical.\n\n195\n00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.670\nBut the advantage of booting here is\nthat by booting off of the USB key\n\n196\n00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.260\nI'm not using the hard drive at all.\n\n197\n00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.040\nAm I not using the hard drive?\n\n198\n00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.960\nThat means that I can do whatever\nI want to the hard drive and\n\n199\n00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.900\nnone of the files are locked.\n\n200\n00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.360\nNow, let's talk about that real quick.\n\n201\n00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.100\nWe'll, take a break from\nusing the computer for\n\n202\n00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.420\na second and let's talk about partitions.\n\n203\n00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:09.600\nNormally, when we get a hard drive,\nyou just format the whole hard drive out,\n\n204\n00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.050\nand it's one big drive, right?\n\n205\n00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:14.420\nSo if I choose to buy a Mac Mini\nwith a 1 terabyte drive,\n\n206\n00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.920\nI could format it as a 1 terabyte disk and\nthat's that right?\n\n207\n00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.030\nBut you can divide the disk up in\nthe smaller partition if you want there's\n\n208\n00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:27.007\na few scenarios to for that,\nnow I personally don't usually do that but\n\n209\n00:10:27.007 --> 00:10:29.811\nthere are few scenarios\nwas do you partitioning?\n\n210\n00:10:29.811 --> 00:10:33.215\n&gt;&gt; I do, yeah I did to, I used,\ntypically have a one small partition for\n\n211\n00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:35.860\nthe operating system and\none for my data and operating\n\n212\n00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.340\nredundancy just try to isolate any malware\nI might get int the operating system.\n\n213\n00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:45.290\nYeah, in the olden days [LAUGH]\nsound like we got a wooden computer.\n\n214\n00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.710\nBut back in the olden days hard drive\npartitions could only be so large.\n\n215\n00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.640\nAnd so when you had a physical disk that\nwas bigger than what your file system\n\n216\n00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.090\ncould support you had to\npartition it to deal with that.\n\n217\n00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.180\nWe don't have that problem any more,\n\n218\n00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.380\nwe haven't had that problem\nin like a decade now.\n\n219\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.250\nSo if you have a one terabyte drive or\na four terabyte drive then farm that out,\n\n220\n00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.100\none big partition, off you go.\n\n221\n00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.940\nSo there's not really\na whole lot of benefits for\n\n222\n00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.990\ndoing more than one partition except for\nwhat Wes said, isolation.\n\n223\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:17.600\nIf we wanna isolate data out, I'm trying\nto do a clean install of Mac OS Sierra.\n\n224\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.100\nIf I just have one partition,\nthen I've gotta erase that partition and\n\n225\n00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:21.690\ndo a clean install.\n\n226\n00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.950\nAnd of all of my data is right\nthere in that partition,\n\n227\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.910\nI'm gonna lose all my data, which If I\nbacked it up, isn't a big deal, right?\n\n228\n00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:32.230\nBut if I had two partitions,\nif I divided the drive in half,\n\n229\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.860\nI could've had my operating system and\napplications on one partition.\n\n230\n00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.750\nAnd I could've had all my personal\ndata on the second partition,\n\n231\n00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.350\nall my documents, my files,\nthat kinda stuff, on the second partition.\n\n232\n00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:47.680\nAnd when I wanted to do a clean install,\nI could just erase the first partition,\n\n233\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.400\nand leave the second partition alone,\nright?\n\n234\n00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.630\nAnd leave all my data there.\n\n235\n00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.290\nSo I do a nice, clean install, but\nall my data is waiting right there for me.\n\n236\n00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.020\nThat's a reason where we\nmight do partitioning.\n\n237\n00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.140\nLet me caution you real quick, cuz I\nhave heard from more than one person,\n\n238\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.330\nwhere they say,\nwell I got a one terabyte drive.\n\n239\n00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.470\nSo I divide it in half,\ntwo 500 gig partitions, and\n\n240\n00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.180\nI use the second partition for\ntime machine.\n\n241\n00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.530\nOkay, well, you can do that,\nIt will let you do that.\n\n242\n00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.160\nNow you're doing your backups\nto the second partition.\n\n243\n00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.360\nAnd if you accidentally delete\na file in your main partition,\n\n244\n00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.410\nyou can go to time machine and recover it.\n\n245\n00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.980\nBut, what happens if\nyour hard drive fails?\n\n246\n00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.050\nPartitions are a logical thing.\n\n247\n00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.330\nWe're logically dividing a disk in half.\n\n248\n00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.930\nIt's still one physical disk.\n\n249\n00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.580\nIf the physical disk fails,\nyou lose both partitions, so time\n\n250\n00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:41.410\nmachine in that scenario would not protect\nyou from a physical hard drive failure, if\n\n251\n00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.410\nyour physical hard drive fails you, you'll\nlose all of your data and that's bad.\n\n252\n00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:48.330\nSo, a time machine you really\nneed to have a second disk,\n\n253\n00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.370\na separate hard drive not\na partition on your main drive.\n\n254\n00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.210\nThe recovery partition\nthat's a different story,\n\n255\n00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.870\nrecovery partition is not\nour personal data, right?\n\n256\n00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.080\nAnd you can easily rebuild recovery\npartition right off the USB key.\n\n257\n00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.260\nSo you'll have the recovery partition\nright alongside your OS on the same disk\n\n258\n00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.720\nbecause, you can easily duplicate it.\n\n259\n00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.520\nBut your personal data you\ncan't easily duplicate.\n\n260\n00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.380\nNow there is another reason\nwhere it's useful to isolate.\n\n261\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.210\nAnd that's if you have a ton of data and\n\n262\n00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.720\nyou're worried about\nthe disk getting full.\n\n263\n00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.080\nIf you have one partition and\nthe hard drive becomes full,\n\n264\n00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.970\nyour operating system starts to freak\nout because the OS has temporary files.\n\n265\n00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.620\nThings where it swaps\nthings from random disk.\n\n266\n00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.940\nAnd if it runs at a hard drive space,\nit can't handle that very well and\n\n267\n00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.525\nit would usually lock up and\nstart acting really weird.\n\n268\n00:13:34.525 --> 00:13:37.270\nMac's do crazy things when\nthe hard drive is full.\n\n269\n00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.860\nBut, if I do partitions and\nI separate it out.\n\n270\n00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.190\nI can have all of my data on a second\npartition and, yeah, my fill up, but\n\n271\n00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.320\nthe operating system is\non its own partition and\n\n272\n00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.290\nhas some extra breathing room, right.\n\n273\n00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.170\nAnd there everything runs nice and\nfine and we don't need to worry about it.\n\n274\n00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:54.420\nSo those are a couple of reasons\nwhere you might use partitioning.\n\n275\n00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.590\n&gt;&gt; Don, now that seems like you\nshould avoid single partitions at all\n\n276\n00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.440\ncosts there.\n\n277\n00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.398\nIs there other scenarios in which there's\na benefit in having a single partition?\n\n278\n00:14:02.398 --> 00:14:06.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, I guess when you put that way,\nWes, yeah.\n\n279\n00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.770\nIt looks like I'm saying,\nyou always want two partitions.\n\n280\n00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.820\nI never do two partitions ever, right?\n\n281\n00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.550\nAnd the reason is even though\nthere's good reasons for\n\n282\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.360\nit, It's just additional\nadministrative effort, right.\n\n283\n00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.840\nI don't wanna deal with that.\n\n284\n00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.460\nOne partition is easy.\n\n285\n00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.510\nEverything's in one place.\n\n286\n00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.830\nI've got the Macintosh HD.\n\n287\n00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.610\nThat's it, that's where all my junk is.\n\n288\n00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.070\nAnd I sync up to iCloud or Dropbox.\n\n289\n00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.490\nOr other services to back my data up.\n\n290\n00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.410\nSo if I need to erase everything fine,\nwho cares?\n\n291\n00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.470\nI'm backed up to other places.\n\n292\n00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:34.160\nI've got my time machine backup on\nan external disk that works out.\n\n293\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.030\nSo now, I just have one partition and\nthat's all I have to worry about and\n\n294\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.110\nI get the full use of my disk.\n\n295\n00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.650\nIf I have a one terabyte disk and\nI divide it in half, 500 gigs for the OS,\n\n296\n00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.170\n500 gigs for data and\nI fill out my data drive.\n\n297\n00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.550\nDoes my OS really need 500 gigs?\n\n298\n00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.930\nNo.\n\n299\n00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.250\nProbably doesn't even need 100 gigs.\n\n300\n00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.840\nSo now I've got extra space that I\ncan't use, cuz I partition poorly and\n\n301\n00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.080\nI might have to adjust that but\nit becomes a hassle.\n\n302\n00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:02.160\nMessing with partitions is usually\nmore hassle than it's worth,\n\n303\n00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.100\nso for me, 99.9% of the time,\nI'm not going to do partitions.\n\n304\n00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.460\nIt's very,\nvery rare that I would do partitions.\n\n305\n00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.680\nBut you have to think about your use\ncase scenario, and determine whether or\n\n306\n00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.010\nnot that's gonna be the right fit for you.\n\n307\n00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.740\nAll right, so for\nmy system though I should be up and\n\n308\n00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.330\nrunning now and I'm booted up into\nthe installer slash recovery.\n\n309\n00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.314\nWhat if I booted recovery I'd\nsee this exact same screen and\n\n310\n00:15:23.314 --> 00:15:25.770\nwhat it's doing is it's\noffering a few things.\n\n311\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:30.016\nAnd unfortunately, I can't zoom\nin when it's in this installer so\n\n312\n00:15:30.016 --> 00:15:33.527\nthings are a little bit small\nI can't really change it.\n\n313\n00:15:33.527 --> 00:15:36.111\nApple doesn't enable the accessibility\nfeatures at this stage so\n\n314\n00:15:36.111 --> 00:15:38.260\nI can't zoom in to show\neverything in detail.\n\n315\n00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.770\nBut what we're seeing\nare four main options, right.\n\n316\n00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:44.040\nOption one is about I wanna restore\nfrom a time machine backup.\n\n317\n00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.550\nIf my machine is just acting funny and\n\n318\n00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.530\nI want to restore from time machine,\nthat's what I'd want to do, right.\n\n319\n00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.731\nI've also got Install MacOS.\n\n320\n00:15:51.731 --> 00:15:54.395\nIf I'm installing MacOS on a new system or\n\n321\n00:15:54.395 --> 00:16:00.110\nupgrading from a previous OS to Sierra,\nthen that's the option that I'd want.\n\n322\n00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.174\nAll right, we've got get help\nonline where you can go and\n\n323\n00:16:02.174 --> 00:16:03.647\nread documents from Apple's web site.\n\n324\n00:16:03.647 --> 00:16:04.840\nIt's very exciting.\n\n325\n00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.230\nIt does require Internet access.\n\n326\n00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.620\nIf you don't have Internet access,\nthen that's not gonna work for you.\n\n327\n00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.900\nAnd then lastly, the Disk Utility.\n\n328\n00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.820\nNow I want the Disk Utility here,\nand the reason for\n\n329\n00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.880\nthat is I said I want a clean install.\n\n330\n00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.440\nI don't trust this machine.\n\n331\n00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.330\nI don't know what's been\ndone to this machine.\n\n332\n00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.600\nWe pulled it, literally,\nout of a closet before the show, so\n\n333\n00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.740\nI have no idea what's on it.\n\n334\n00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.180\nSo I'm gonna choose that disk utility and\nhit Continue so\n\n335\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.110\nthat I can go in and\ntake a look at the disc.\n\n336\n00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.770\nAnd here's where we go into figure out\nif want to partition the system or\n\n337\n00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.180\ndivide things up.\n\n338\n00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.120\nAnd actually, now that I look at it,\nthis system has more than one drive in it.\n\n339\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.100\nI didn't realize that.\n\n340\n00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.610\nSo looking at it here,\nthis first disk guy,\n\n341\n00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.820\ncuz he's got an Apple hard drive, right?\n\n342\n00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.190\nSo here's this primary disk.\n\n343\n00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.380\nAnd this is where, more than likely,\n\n344\n00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.440\nwhat my operating system just when\nyou're going, it shows a MacIntosh HD.\n\n345\n00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.400\nAfter that I've got\nSanDisk Ultra 3.0 UB Media.\n\n346\n00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.830\nAll right, well, that's my USB key.\n\n347\n00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.110\nSo I don't wanna mess with that one.\n\n348\n00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.790\nThat's where the OS is coming from.\n\n349\n00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:03.380\nAnd as I keep looking down,\nhere's the Apple disk image Media and\n\n350\n00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.020\nmore Apple disks.\n\n351\n00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.020\nThese are virtual disks that\nwere created by the installer.\n\n352\n00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.340\nSo while it looks like I\nhave multiple hard drives,\n\n353\n00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.780\nin reality I do just have one Hard drive.\n\n354\n00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.220\nAnd when I look at that one drive,\nsee how I only see one partition?\n\n355\n00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.620\nOne big partition for Macintosh HD.\n\n356\n00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.980\nBut we know that we just saw\na recovery partition a minute ago.\n\n357\n00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.700\nWell the disk utility hides that.\n\n358\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.960\nThe disk utility doesn't show you\neverything that's on the disk.\n\n359\n00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.730\nIt kind of hides a few things.\n\n360\n00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:31.700\nAnd in this case,\n\n361\n00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.490\nit's hiding that recovery partition If I\nwant to erase this disk, I can do that.\n\n362\n00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.710\nI can erase it, and\nthat recovery partition?\n\n363\n00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.760\nWell, it may or may not get deleted.\n\n364\n00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.200\nIf I come over here on the left side and\n\n365\n00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.050\nI choose Macintosh HD, right now I'm\nlooking at the actual hard drive.\n\n366\n00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:51.040\nI can use the erase option, and\nI can just erase Macintosh HD.\n\n367\n00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:56.660\nAnd it leaves the recovery\npartition alone versus,\n\n368\n00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.920\nif I go to the actual disk and\nI hit Erase.\n\n369\n00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.730\nNow it's gonna erase the whole disk,\n\n370\n00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.360\nwhich will include partitions\nthat we don't see here.\n\n371\n00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.610\nThings like that recovery partition\nwould get wiped out and go away.\n\n372\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.160\nOkay, so be aware that where you\nclick here is going to make a bit of\n\n373\n00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.420\na difference on how this\nis going to get erased.\n\n374\n00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.870\nThe other thing is when I erase it,\nit's only doing one partition, right or\n\n375\n00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.170\none that it's gonna show me, right?\n\n376\n00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.690\nSo it's gonna wipe that out, and\n\n377\n00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:27.150\nthen I'm just gonna have one nice\nempty partition when this is done.\n\n378\n00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.330\nSo now i know that any files\nthat were on the disk are gone.\n\n379\n00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.440\nIf I'm worried about somebody putting\nbad stuff on there, that's gone now, and\n\n380\n00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.010\nI've got a nice empty disk.\n\n381\n00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.630\n&gt;&gt; Don, when you're using the disk\nutilities, are you doing this for\n\n382\n00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.430\nsecurity purposes and data remnants, or\nare you doing it for spring cleaning, or\n\n383\n00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.510\nis it just for customization, just so\nyou're controlling exactly how\n\n384\n00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.340\nthat disk gets formatted prior to\nputting the operating system on it.\n\n385\n00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.100\n&gt;&gt; That's really all of the above, tight?\n\n386\n00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:55.010\nWhen you do an upgrade, remnant files,\nfiles from the previous OS, stay there.\n\n387\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.190\nAnd so if there were malicious files or\ninfected files,\n\n388\n00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.710\nthey stay there That's not all that\ncommon on a Mac, but it can happen.\n\n389\n00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:05.100\nOr just junked up file preferences, from\napplications that you want to go away,\n\n390\n00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.020\nthat they would stay there on an upgrade.\n\n391\n00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.390\nBy erasing the drive,\nI make sure that all that data is gone.\n\n392\n00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:16.220\nAnd in fact, if I click on the disk,\nI can see that it is empty.\n\n393\n00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.540\nThere's nothing in there.\n\n394\n00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:21.140\nIt's not named Macintosh HD anymore,\nI should probably rename that.\n\n395\n00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.150\nBut otherwise, nice and empty.\n\n396\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.520\nI know all of that is gone.\n\n397\n00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.830\nSo, for security, for spring cleaning,\nfor control, it's all there.\n\n398\n00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.820\nThe only thing I didn't do was\npartitioning and you'll see up here I do\n\n399\n00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:35.110\nhave the option where I could partition\nit out and divide it up into sub disks.\n\n400\n00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.160\nBut again I don't normally do that on\nthese disks cuz it's just not a ton of\n\n401\n00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.330\nbenefit as long as you're not\ngonna run it out of space.\n\n402\n00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.160\n&gt;&gt; Well Don you could\ndo the installer right?\n\n403\n00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.890\nIf I understand this right and you can let\nthe installer go ahead and do all this but\n\n404\n00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.870\nyou would lose all this that\nflexibility and that control, right?\n\n405\n00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.450\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, you can use the installer,\nbut it doesn't give you a lot of options.\n\n406\n00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.220\nSo like if I wanted a partition, you\ndon't have that option in the installer.\n\n407\n00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.700\nIf you want a partition, you're going\nto have to go to Disk Utility to do it.\n\n408\n00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.120\nAnd as far as erasing the drive, when\nyou do the installer if you choose to do\n\n409\n00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.540\nan upgrade, it doesn't give you the option\nto erase cuz you're upgrading, right?\n\n410\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.960\nSo that's a problem there.\n\n411\n00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.200\nSo there are times you'll need\nto drop to the Disk Utility.\n\n412\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.610\nAnd some of this can get changed later.\n\n413\n00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.500\nSo for example, partitioning If\nyou decided to do Boot Camp later.\n\n414\n00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.300\nBoot Camp will actually partition the\ndrive out to make room for Windows to run.\n\n415\n00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.670\nIf you don't know about Boot Camp,\n\n416\n00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.890\nit lets you run Microsoft Windows\nright on your Apple hardware.\n\n417\n00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.620\nYou obviously wanna keep\nMac OS too though, so\n\n418\n00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.180\nit uses partitions to create\na Windows hard drive and\n\n419\n00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:30.750\na Mac OS hard drive, right, basically two\nvirtual hard drives on one physical disk.\n\n420\n00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.680\nAll right, so let's say that I\nwanted to set up partitions, tight.\n\n421\n00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.590\nWell, I would come in here\nto my Disk Utility and\n\n422\n00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.050\nnotice the partition button at\nthe top is kinda grayed out.\n\n423\n00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.310\nThat's because I'm clicked on a partition.\n\n424\n00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.920\nBut if you click on\nthe physical disk itself,\n\n425\n00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.470\nnow the partition button lights up and\nyou can click on that and\n\n426\n00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:53.900\nyou can come in here and you can define\na partition and set the size, right.\n\n427\n00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.760\nSo right now, it's one big disk,\nright, for this untitled partition.\n\n428\n00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.830\nAnd so I'm gonna change that\nto be called Macintosh HD,\n\n429\n00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.710\nwhich is really just a really old name\nthat's been around for a long time.\n\n430\n00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.470\nPeople are kinda used to\ncalling the disk that.\n\n431\n00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:11.700\nBut down here, I can hit the plus sign,\nand I can start to create more partitions.\n\n432\n00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.210\nSo I might want to create\na partition called you know data or\n\n433\n00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.680\nstorage or whatever right.\n\n434\n00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.410\nThis is gonna be where I can\nput my personal stuff and\n\n435\n00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.130\nas you build it you'll see there's\nthis little white dot here and so\n\n436\n00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:27.140\nyou can resize and change things\nbased on what you want right?\n\n437\n00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:32.000\nAnd it won't let you go too crazy on\nthese because you need room to install\n\n438\n00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.400\nthe operating system but maybe I want\n75% of my data for storage And then, for\n\n439\n00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.650\nmy operating system,\na smaller drive, right?\n\n440\n00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:39.970\nSo you can kinda divide the drive up,\n\n441\n00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:43.010\nbased on what your needs are,\nto get that put in place.\n\n442\n00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.840\nThat's the power we have when\nwe go through Disk Utility.\n\n443\n00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:51.180\nYou don't have these options when you go\nthrough the regular installer, right?\n\n444\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.180\nSo that's gonna reach in there and\npartition that out.\n\n445\n00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.980\nAnd then we'll be ready to\ncontinue with the install.\n\n446\n00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.240\nWe are going to go to\nthe installer eventually.\n\n447\n00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.400\nThe other thing is,\nyou can drop to terminal and\n\n448\n00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.360\ndo a lot of this stuff too, right.\n\n449\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.160\nI'm doing it here through\nthe GUI because that's easy and\n\n450\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.030\nthat's the way that Apple\nintends you to do it.\n\n451\n00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.760\nBut a lot of this stuff can\nbe done through the terminal.\n\n452\n00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.760\nIf I get out of Disk Utility and\n\n453\n00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.710\nI go back here, It's easy to get\ndistracted by these four big giant options\n\n454\n00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.180\nin the middle of the screen by up top\nyou've got the utilities menu and\n\n455\n00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.980\nunder utilities you'll find where\nyou can launch the terminal.\n\n456\n00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:29.460\nAnd when you get into the terminal you're\ndown into the BSD kind of UNIX interface.\n\n457\n00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.700\nDid I not click on it?\n\n458\n00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.390\nThere we go.\n\n459\n00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:35.580\nIt's just taking its time but\nyou can drop down to this interface And\n\n460\n00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.070\nfrom here you can access\nall sorts of things.\n\n461\n00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:44.710\nSo for example, I can run diskutil-l and,\n\n462\n00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.100\nops diskutil list, how about that?\n\n463\n00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.020\nThere we go and I can pull up a listing of\nall of my disks and what's on the system.\n\n464\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:55.320\nAnd I can use diskutil from the command\nline and there is things that don't show\n\n465\n00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:02.240\nup in here That if I run it from\nthe command line, I can see a lot more.\n\n466\n00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.142\nFor example, the recovery partition\nwhich I think I've killed at this point.\n\n467\n00:23:06.142 --> 00:23:08.097\n[LAUGH] We scroll back here.\n\n468\n00:23:08.097 --> 00:23:11.550\nWe start to see the disk and\nHere it is, so\n\n469\n00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:16.910\nI can see this 500 gig disk that I've got,\nand now I can see the 125 gigs\n\n470\n00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:21.830\nthat I put for Macintosh HD,\nand 374 gigs for storage.\n\n471\n00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.950\nThere's a 209 meg partition for the EFI.\n\n472\n00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.560\nI didn't see that in Disk Utility,\nbut I see it here.\n\n473\n00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.690\nSo from the command line,\n\n474\n00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.180\nthere's even more that we can do,\nthat we don't normally see, right?\n\n475\n00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.490\nSo you might need to do that for\na really advanced configuration.\n\n476\n00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.030\nMost of us aren't going\nto have to do that.\n\n477\n00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:42.720\nAll right, so assuming that we\nget our partitioning set up, or\n\n478\n00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.360\nassuming that we just erased the disk and\n\n479\n00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:49.110\nhave one big partition, Then we're\nready to move on with our installation.\n\n480\n00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.543\nAnd as far as moving on with\nthe installation is concerned,\n\n481\n00:23:51.543 --> 00:23:52.913\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n482\n00:23:52.913 --> 00:23:54.990\nLet me quit out of\nthe terminal here real quick.\n\n483\n00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.641\nAnd it'll return me back to my installer.\n\n484\n00:23:56.641 --> 00:24:00.721\nNow I can choose to install macOS\nSierra We can continue, and now it's gonna\n\n485\n00:24:00.721 --> 00:24:05.760\ncome through and it'll actually ask me to\npick the drive that I'm installing on.\n\n486\n00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.200\nIf you have more than one hard drive,\nor if you have more than one partition,\n\n487\n00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.410\nit's gonna show you those partitions and\ndrives so that you can pick.\n\n488\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.900\nSo as I advance through the installer,\nwell I get my licensing agreement,\n\n489\n00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.790\nwe get through our 20 lawyer\nspeak pages here, and eventually,\n\n490\n00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.150\nwe get to the good stuff here, where\nwe pick where we're gonna install it.\n\n491\n00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.440\nAnd I can see Macintosh HD,\nI can see storage.\n\n492\n00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.370\nIf I had made it too small,\nI wouldn't even be able to click on it.\n\n493\n00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:31.900\nIt would be grayed out.\n\n494\n00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.010\nSee how this USB drive is grayed out?\n\n495\n00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.958\nWell, if I click on it, it's warning me\nlike, \"hey that's my installation media\".\n\n496\n00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:42.440\nI can't install on the installation media,\nit's gonna mess everything up.\n\n497\n00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.900\nSo I'm gonna choose the main partition\nthat we created, and I'll go ahead and\n\n498\n00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.540\nmove forward on that, and there we go,\nnow it's gonna start the installation.\n\n499\n00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:53.361\nAnd when it's done, I'll have a fresh and\nclean install of Sierra.\n\n500\n00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.250\nIf I had picked a partition\nthat already had Mac OS on it,\n\n501\n00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:02.570\nmaybe it had Yosemite or El Capitan\nwas already on it when I picked that,\n\n502\n00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.680\ninstead of doing a fresh and\nclean install it would do an upgrade.\n\n503\n00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.340\nIt would actually upgrade it and\npreserve all of my applications,\n\n504\n00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.800\nall of my data, my documents and so on.\n\n505\n00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.370\nSo that is something I may not want.\n\n506\n00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.010\nAnd that's why in this episode I was\nshowing you guys going into Disk Utility\n\n507\n00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:18.970\nand erasing the disk.\n\n508\n00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.220\nSo now I know I'm gonna get a good,\nclean copy of Sierra.\n\n509\n00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.780\nAnd when it's up and running I've got\na computer that should be running nice and\n\n510\n00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:30.060\nfast, nice and smooth and I know and\ncan trust everything that's on it.\n\n511\n00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.220\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, lot of great information\ngetting that operating system installed.\n\n512\n00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.940\nLooking forward to the episode yet to\ncome where we can actually lift the hood,\n\n513\n00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.590\nget in there and\ndo a little peeking and tweaking.\n\n514\n00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.680\nBut we do not have\nthe time in this episode.\n\n515\n00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.380\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n516\n00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.110\nBut before we do Don,\n\n517\n00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.290\nyou got any parting words about\ngetting your installation started?\n\n518\n00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, key thing to remember here is if\nyou get your partition scheme wrong or\n\n519\n00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.530\nyou decide to change it later,\n\n520\n00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.900\njust doesn't work out,\nyou actually can change it later.\n\n521\n00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.210\nIt's not a binding decision,\nit's just harder.\n\n522\n00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:56.995\nIt's harder to go and change it later.\n\n523\n00:25:56.995 --> 00:26:01.020\nWorst-case scenario, you can always back\nup a time machine, erase the whole system,\n\n524\n00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.430\nand then redo the installation and\nrestore your data.\n\n525\n00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:05.970\nIt's a lot of work.\n\n526\n00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.990\nSo you can change your partition\neven without doing that.\n\n527\n00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.920\nIt just takes a lot of effort and\nit's more challenging later on.\n\n528\n00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.660\nSo it's better to get the partition\nschemes set up properly\n\n529\n00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.410\nin the beginning if\nyou're even gonna use it.\n\n530\n00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.920\nRemember what I said, I always just\ndo one partition and that's it.\n\n531\n00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.470\nUnless I have more than one physical disk,\n\n532\n00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:24.400\ncuz then each disk is\nrepresented separately.\n\n533\n00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.910\nIt's still one partition per disk.\n\n534\n00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:28.620\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n535\n00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.210\nEverybody's needs\nare a little bit different.\n\n536\n00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.030\nSo figure out what works for you.\n\n537\n00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:34.210\n&gt;&gt; All right Don,\nthat's a great place to wrap this one up.\n\n538\n00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.470\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n539\n00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:38.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

00:00:08.171\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:11.861\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:15.170\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to ITProTV,\nwe're glad you're joining us today.\n\n6\n00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.220\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.440\nwe're continuing through our\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n8\n00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.460\nAnd joining us back in the studios\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.540\nDon, how are you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.582\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes, ready to dive\nright back into the world of ACSP.\n\n11\n00:00:27.582 --> 00:00:31.217\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ntaking a look at OS Recover, or\n\n12\n00:00:31.217 --> 00:00:33.510\noperating system recovery.\n\n13\n00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.440\nThere are times when Mac OS just doesn't\nbehave the way that it's supposed to.\n\n14\n00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.706\nAnd we can't boot up,\ncan't get into our operating system and\n\n15\n00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.520\nwe need to do something to get back up and\nrunning.\n\n16\n00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.076\nSo we're gonna look at some of\nthe potential causes of that and\n\n17\n00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:45.411\nthe ways that we can address it.\n\n18\n00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:48.639\nAnd get our systems back up and\nrunning right here in this episode.\n\n19\n00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:51.568\nAll right, well let's start off with\nhow we end up in this situation,\n\n20\n00:00:51.568 --> 00:00:52.592\nin the first place.\n\n21\n00:00:52.592 --> 00:00:56.629\nThere are any number of things that\ncan cause Mac OS not to start up.\n\n22\n00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.329\nNow, deep down under the hood, Mac OS is\nactually a Unix-based operating system.\n\n23\n00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.986\nWhich means it's incredibly stable and\nincredibly reliable.\n\n24\n00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:10.788\nAnd the thing about Unix is it is reliable\nand stable but it is insanely complex and\n\n25\n00:01:10.788 --> 00:01:11.575\nhard to use.\n\n26\n00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:15.521\nUnless you stick a very nice graphic user\ninterface on top of it that makes it super\n\n27\n00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:16.170\neasy to use.\n\n28\n00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.380\nWhich is exactly what Apple did.\n\n29\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.630\nSo we get an easy to use OS\nthat's incredibly reliable and\n\n30\n00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.520\nstable under the hood.\n\n31\n00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.620\nSo normally everything runs fine.\n\n32\n00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.009\nThe problem is it's not always normal,\nright.\n\n33\n00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.529\nSometimes we can have disk failures and\nother things.\n\n34\n00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:33.660\nThat make it where our\nsystem does not boot up and\n\n35\n00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.500\noperate the way that we expect.\n\n36\n00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.080\nSo, let me just kind of run\ndown a few scenarios for\n\n37\n00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.900\nyou to help you out with this.\n\n38\n00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.550\nYou can actually have hardware failing and\n\n39\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.800\none of the more common pieces\nthat fail is the power supply.\n\n40\n00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.260\nIf the power supply is failing in your\nsystem, and you push the power button,\n\n41\n00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.480\nguess what happens?\n\n42\n00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.130\nNothing, absolutely nothing.\n\n43\n00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.330\nIf you push the button and\nnothing happens,\n\n44\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.900\nyou pretty much know you\nhave a bad power supply.\n\n45\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.430\nYou can try plugging it into a few\ndifferent outlets, see if that changes.\n\n46\n00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.618\nA bad power supply always results\nin needing to call Apple and\n\n47\n00:02:01.618 --> 00:02:03.568\ngetting a repair done on it, right.\n\n48\n00:02:03.568 --> 00:02:06.170\nTaking it to an Apple Store, or whatever.\n\n49\n00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.502\nBut after that,\n\n50\n00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:10.650\nthere are a few other components\nthat can fail, things like memory.\n\n51\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.970\nIf memory starts to fail, you'll see\nrandom freezes on the laptop or desktop.\n\n52\n00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.590\nYou'll see video artifacts on\nthe screen where video renders weird.\n\n53\n00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.710\nYou'll see little kind of strange dots\nappear on the screen and things like that.\n\n54\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.170\nMemory usually results in\njust the device freezing.\n\n55\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.080\nSo you're running,\nthings are working fine.\n\n56\n00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.510\nAnd then all of a sudden your laptop or\ndesktop just stops.\n\n57\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.800\nAnd you reboot and\neverything's fine again, right?\n\n58\n00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.550\nBut it just randomly stops.\n\n59\n00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.622\nA lot of times that indicates bad memory.\n\n60\n00:02:38.622 --> 00:02:39.663\nAnd if you have bad memory,\n\n61\n00:02:39.663 --> 00:02:42.029\nthat's gonna result in you taking\nit down to the Apple Store.\n\n62\n00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.471\nAnd getting warranty work done on it or\npaying for it to be repaired.\n\n63\n00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:51.178\nRight, but another thing that can\nhappen is on the disk side of things.\n\n64\n00:02:51.178 --> 00:02:53.890\nIf you're running along and\nusing your system.\n\n65\n00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.983\nAnd also there's a power outage or\n\n66\n00:02:55.983 --> 00:02:59.528\nsome kind of unexpected reason\nwhy the device shuts down.\n\n67\n00:02:59.528 --> 00:03:03.640\nThe next time you power back up\nit might not be able to boot.\n\n68\n00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.950\nYou might get something strange like\nwhat I've got pulled up on my Mac\n\n69\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.170\nmini right here.\n\n70\n00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.200\nIf we look at it.\n\n71\n00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.210\nI booted it up, and what do I get?\n\n72\n00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.440\nA little folder with a question mark.\n\n73\n00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.220\nOkay, well if you've been\nwatching all of our shows.\n\n74\n00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.940\nAt the end of the last episode, I had\nthis Mac mini installing MacOS Sierra.\n\n75\n00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.320\nI booted off my USB key,\nI started the installer.\n\n76\n00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.192\nWell, about halfway through it,\nI yanked the power plug off it.\n\n77\n00:03:25.192 --> 00:03:28.810\n[LAUGH] That's not what you're\nsupposed to do but why not?\n\n78\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.220\nSo, I yanked the power plug off.\n\n79\n00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.230\nSo now whenever I power it on,\nI get this right here.\n\n80\n00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.400\nAll right, now, what does that indicate?\n\n81\n00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.720\nThe flashing folder\nwith the question mark,\n\n82\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.120\nI usually call it the sad Mac because in\nthe old days, it was a different logo.\n\n83\n00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.040\nIt had a picture of a Mac\nwith a frowning face on it.\n\n84\n00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.200\nIt was called the sad Mac.\n\n85\n00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.930\nThey did away with that\na few versions ago.\n\n86\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.200\nNow, we get the folder\nwith a question mark.\n\n87\n00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.220\nThat means that it can see a hard\ndrive in those as hard drive there.\n\n88\n00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.370\nBut it can't find an operating system,\nit can't find a valid OS, right?\n\n89\n00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.370\nThis happens a lot when there\nis been disk corruption.\n\n90\n00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.178\nIn my case there is significant disk\ncorruption cuz not only that I yanked\n\n91\n00:04:02.178 --> 00:04:04.350\nthe power cable,\nI didn't even let it finish install.\n\n92\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.260\nSo it's got half an operating\nsystem on there.\n\n93\n00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.390\nIf that happens we need to\nrecover our operating system.\n\n94\n00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.709\nWe need to get it back up on operational.\n\n95\n00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.273\nIf the physical hard drive is failing,\nthen we need to replace the hard drive.\n\n96\n00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:21.770\nAnd if it's a Mac Mini like this,\nyou can actually service it yourself.\n\n97\n00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.610\nYou can pop the bottom panel off and\nbit more replace hard drive.\n\n98\n00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.130\nIf it's a Macbook though\nlike Wes's over there,\n\n99\n00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.050\nhe's got an SSD that's\nintegrated into the motherboard.\n\n100\n00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.730\nYou can't fix that on your own.\n\n101\n00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.830\nYou gotta take that to Apple and\nget them to repair it.\n\n102\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.139\nSo there are different\nlevels of failure here.\n\n103\n00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.159\nHow do you know if it's\ngoing to be that bad?\n\n104\n00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.018\nWell, there are hardware\ndiagnostics that you can run.\n\n105\n00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:41.845\nBut you really need to\ntake it down to Apple.\n\n106\n00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:44.390\nThey'll diagnose it for free and\nthey can tell you what the problem is.\n\n107\n00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.778\nWell, if it's a simple hard drive,\nI can replace it myself.\n\n108\n00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:51.183\nBut when that's done, I need to get\nthe operating system back on there.\n\n109\n00:04:51.183 --> 00:04:56.350\nAnd we can just go back and do what we saw\non the last episode, reinstall the OS.\n\n110\n00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.280\nBut what if it's not a bad hard drive?\n\n111\n00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.160\nWhat if it's just the data got corrupted?\n\n112\n00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.480\nHey, there was a lightning strike,\npower went out in the building,\n\n113\n00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.840\nmy device shut down.\n\n114\n00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.270\nI know all my data's on there.\n\n115\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.370\nI just need to get the operating system\nworking again, and I can get at my data.\n\n116\n00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.530\nI don't wanna format,\ncuz I'll lose my data, right?\n\n117\n00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.330\nHow can I just repair the operating\nsystem, and get up and going?\n\n118\n00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.189\nAll right, well, there area few different\ntechniques we can use for that.\n\n119\n00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:22.060\nDepending on how old your Mac is, or\nwhat operating system you're running.\n\n120\n00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.575\nAssuming that you're running Sierra,\nall the tools are right there,\n\n121\n00:05:26.575 --> 00:05:29.518\nalongside your installation media, right?\n\n122\n00:05:29.518 --> 00:05:34.418\nIf I've got a device that was\nworking properly up until now.\n\n123\n00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:38.670\nThe odds are I have a recovery partition\nright on the disk that I can use to boot\n\n124\n00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.810\noff of and recover my operating\nsystem from it, right?\n\n125\n00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.102\nNow the problem here is the recovery\npartition is installed on the hard drive\n\n126\n00:05:46.102 --> 00:05:48.259\nas part of the installation process.\n\n127\n00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.832\nAnd it's on the hard drive right\nnext to your operating system.\n\n128\n00:05:51.832 --> 00:05:56.190\nIf your OS disk became corrupted\nthe recovery partition is probably fine.\n\n129\n00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.976\nAnd you can boot off that recovery\npartition and you could heal the system.\n\n130\n00:05:59.976 --> 00:06:02.096\nBut if it's a physical drive problem,\n\n131\n00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:04.999\nthe recovery partition is\nprobably damaged as well.\n\n132\n00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:10.187\nAnd at that point, you need to boot off\nof an external media of some sort, right.\n\n133\n00:06:10.187 --> 00:06:13.045\nIn MacOS Sierra the installation media,\n\n134\n00:06:13.045 --> 00:06:17.139\nthe USB key that I used to install\nMac OS in the last episode.\n\n135\n00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.200\nIt serves as an external\nrecovery partition.\n\n136\n00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.850\nIf I need an external recovery partition,\nI just need install media.\n\n137\n00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.540\nAny installation media you\ncan use to boot to recovery.\n\n138\n00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.790\nI say any media,\nany media that's built for Sierra, right.\n\n139\n00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.240\nSo it could be a USB key,\nit could be a USB hard drive,\n\n140\n00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.990\nit's whatever you use to install with.\n\n141\n00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.410\nI usually keep one of these handy\nbecause you can use it for this purpose.\n\n142\n00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.340\nAlso, any time machine disk.\n\n143\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.369\nIf you have a USB drive that you've\nbeen using for time machine.\n\n144\n00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:47.198\nApple doesn't really promote this a lot,\nbut when you make a time machine disk,\n\n145\n00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.630\nit actually puts a recovery\npartition on there.\n\n146\n00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.190\nYou can boot off of your time machine\ndisk, kind of neat, but you can do that,\n\n147\n00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.330\nall right?\n\n148\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.510\nNow, for Sierra, it's super easy.\n\n149\n00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.380\nBut if you have an older system.\n\n150\n00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.990\nMaybe you're running something like\nMountain Lion, hopefully you're not,\n\n151\n00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.060\nbut maybe you are.\n\n152\n00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.600\nMountain Lion couldn't do recovery\nfrom its installation disk.\n\n153\n00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.400\nIt didn't have all the utilities on there.\n\n154\n00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.070\nSo for it,\nyou actually had to go to Apple's website.\n\n155\n00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.320\nAnd you could build\nan external recovery disk.\n\n156\n00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.490\nAnd it was free.\n\n157\n00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.330\nYou just go to the website.\n\n158\n00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.540\nYou can download this little utility.\n\n159\n00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.800\nIt builds the disk out.\n\n160\n00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.750\nAnd then, you've got it, but\n\n161\n00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.120\nwith all the newer OSes, it's done\nright from the installation media.\n\n162\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.760\nSo if I want to repair this computer\nright here, what I need to do is pop in\n\n163\n00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.970\nmy recovery media and\nthen we can go through that process.\n\n164\n00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.220\nNow, if you have a device that's\nbeen made in last few years,\n\n165\n00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.650\nyou can do internet recovery also.\n\n166\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.950\nI mentioned internet recovery\nin the last episode.\n\n167\n00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.940\nI'm not a big fan of it.\n\n168\n00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.608\nIt's great if you have no media, right?\n\n169\n00:07:37.608 --> 00:07:41.619\nThough you put in a blank hard drive\nyou don't have external media handy.\n\n170\n00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:44.770\nSo you boot and\nyou boot to internet recovery.\n\n171\n00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.396\nWith internet recovery, it's downloading\nthe recovery partition from Apple\n\n172\n00:07:48.396 --> 00:07:50.461\nservers and it's about 800 megs in size.\n\n173\n00:07:50.461 --> 00:07:51.732\nSo it takes a while.\n\n174\n00:07:51.732 --> 00:07:52.969\nIt's slow.\nSo if I were to boot and\n\n175\n00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:56.027\ndo internet recovery,\nI'm gonna have to be patient, right?\n\n176\n00:07:56.027 --> 00:08:00.691\nSo for example with my Mac Mini\nhere If I reboot it, and\n\n177\n00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:03.801\nstart to go into the boot process and\n\n178\n00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:09.110\nchoose to do Internet Recovery,\nit can take a while, okay.\n\n179\n00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.460\nNow booting the Internet Recovery,\nwe'll go through the process here.\n\n180\n00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.810\nI'm gonna take this one, and\nI can't remember if it's off or not.\n\n181\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.990\nSo I'm just gonna hold this power\nbutton to make sure it's turned off.\n\n182\n00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.230\nRemember on Macs, they don't have\nlike a giant on-off switch, right?\n\n183\n00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.210\nThey normally have an on-off switch\nthat's hidden away somewhere.\n\n184\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.740\nAnd if the device is locked or frozen or\n\n185\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.740\nat that flashing folder icon, pushing\nthe power button might not doing anything.\n\n186\n00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.430\nBut if you hold it for ten seconds,\n\n187\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.709\nit sends a command to the power\nsupply saying, just cut the power.\n\n188\n00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:38.752\nJust give up, [LAUGH] cut the power.\n\n189\n00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:41.238\nSo that's what I just did, is I held\nthat power button for ten seconds,\n\n190\n00:08:41.238 --> 00:08:42.410\nto make sure this was turned off.\n\n191\n00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.760\nWhen it turns on, [COUGH] if you hold\nthe option key on your keyboard, it's\n\n192\n00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.500\ngonna boot up and it will get to where I\ncan select what media I wanna boot from.\n\n193\n00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.700\nSo that's what I'm doing right now, I'm\nbooting up and I'm holding my option key.\n\n194\n00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.840\nNow the screen is gonna be black for\na moment until it gets to my selection and\n\n195\n00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.380\nas soon as that happens I'll see a list\nof all the disks that I can boot from.\n\n196\n00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.030\nWell, notice I don't see any hard drives,\nright?\n\n197\n00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.043\nI don't see Macintosh HD.\n\n198\n00:09:09.043 --> 00:09:10.680\nI don't see Recovery.\n\n199\n00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.310\nThat means that likely I've\ngot a failed hard drive.\n\n200\n00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.200\nAnd so I go to the store.\n\n201\n00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.990\nI buy a new hard drive.\n\n202\n00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.540\nI swap in the new hard drive and\nI'll see the same thing.\n\n203\n00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.990\nA new hard drive is completely empty.\n\n204\n00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.340\nYou can't boot off of it.\n\n205\n00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.290\nSo even if the hard drive is good, if it's\nnot bootable, it's not gonna show up here.\n\n206\n00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:32.340\nWell, the hard drive in my Mac is good,\nit's just that I cut the power\n\n207\n00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.420\nto it while it was doing the installation,\nso I may have corrupted files or\n\n208\n00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.130\nI may not even have a valid\noperating system installed.\n\n209\n00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.290\nAnd so it doesn't show up here.\n\n210\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.300\nThis doesn't necessarily tell\nme that the hard drive is dead.\n\n211\n00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.620\nWe'll have to test for that to find out.\n\n212\n00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.813\nI see my USB drive here.\n\n213\n00:09:46.813 --> 00:09:53.330\n[COUGH] And so I can choose it, and boot\nfrom it and start recovery from there.\n\n214\n00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.820\nOr I've got where I can set up\na wireless network right beneath that.\n\n215\n00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.958\nAnd when we choose\nthe wireless network setup,\n\n216\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.674\nwe can connect to a wireless network.\n\n217\n00:10:01.674 --> 00:10:06.561\nLike I can choose our ITProTV network and\nI can get connected to it and\n\n218\n00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:11.310\nthat's gonna enable me to be\nable to do Internet Recovery.\n\n219\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.960\nSo once I get connected to my wireless\nnetwork, it's gonna make sure that it can\n\n220\n00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.410\nget to the internet and we'll see\nthe option to do Internet Recovery, right?\n\n221\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.307\nNow if it doesn't show up,\nit means one of two things.\n\n222\n00:10:21.307 --> 00:10:26.090\nEither one, it means that you\ndon't have Internet access, right?\n\n223\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.120\nThat's possible.\n\n224\n00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.550\nOr two, your system might not\nsupport Internet Recovery, right?\n\n225\n00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.850\nWell, in my case, this Mac Mini is [COUGH]\none of the first ones that was designed to\n\n226\n00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.250\nsupport Internet Recovery, so\nI'm not seeing the little globe that would\n\n227\n00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.620\nnormally appear here for\nInternet Recovery.\n\n228\n00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.050\nOn this one, I actually have to force it.\n\n229\n00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.770\nOn a newer Mac,\nyou'd see a globe up here, right here and\n\n230\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.812\nyou could click the globe and\ndo your recovery.\n\n231\n00:10:48.812 --> 00:10:51.553\nOnes that's a little bit older like this\nthough you actually have to do something\n\n232\n00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:52.620\na little different.\n\n233\n00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.750\nI'm gonna power it off, and once I power\nit off, I'm gonna power it back on,\n\n234\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:03.210\nbut this time while I power it on,\nI'm gonna hold Command+I on my keyboard.\n\n235\n00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.410\nSo I'm powering it on and\nholding Command+I.\n\n236\n00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:11.570\nYou're gonna see the screen go black, it's\ngonna go black, it's gonna stay black for\n\n237\n00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.048\na while, it's gonna look like it's\ndoing absolutely nothing, okay.\n\n238\n00:11:15.048 --> 00:11:19.979\nI'm holding Command+I though and that it's\ntelling it to do Internet Recovery right?\n\n239\n00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:24.900\nAnd after a moment,\nI'm gonna see the Apple logo.\n\n240\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.630\nAnd I'm gonna start to see\nthe status bar go across but\n\n241\n00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.060\nit's gonna be a little different\nthan what were used to.\n\n242\n00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.050\nNormally, how long does it take\nthat status bar to scroll across?\n\n243\n00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.190\nSeconds, right?\n\n244\n00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.090\nIt doesn't take very long at all.\n\n245\n00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:37.840\nBut this time,\n\n246\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.370\nI'm gonna see that status bar start\nto go and it's gonna be really slow.\n\n247\n00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.760\nThere's my Apple logo.\n\n248\n00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.923\nAnd that status bar is gonna come up and\nit's gonna start crawling along.\n\n249\n00:11:47.973 --> 00:11:52.156\nNow we could sit here and we could\nwatch this, It's gonna take a while and\n\n250\n00:11:52.156 --> 00:11:54.159\nI don't have the patience for it.\n\n251\n00:11:54.159 --> 00:11:58.263\nIt's downloading an 800 MB file\nfrom Apple via the Internet and\n\n252\n00:11:58.263 --> 00:12:00.860\nit's starting to boot off of that.\n\n253\n00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.320\nSo if you're patient,\nyou can wait, it'll do that.\n\n254\n00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.040\nAnd now we're doing Internet Recovery.\n\n255\n00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.160\nIt doesn't require me to\nhave installation media or\n\n256\n00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.160\nwhatever, it's being done by via network,\nright?\n\n257\n00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.168\nBut it's faster if you\ndo it via your own disk.\n\n258\n00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:18.087\nAnd so I'm going to power back off,\nI'm just gonna hold that power button for\n\n259\n00:12:18.087 --> 00:12:19.124\nabout ten seconds.\n\n260\n00:12:19.124 --> 00:12:23.983\nAnd after it powers off, I'll power back\non while holding Option on my keyboard.\n\n261\n00:12:23.983 --> 00:12:27.630\nAnd this time, here we go.\n\n262\n00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.550\nThis time I'll choose my USB key, right?\n\n263\n00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.600\nInternet Recovery and\nbooting off a USB media\n\n264\n00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.610\nwill provide you with the identical\nsetup once it's up and running, okay?\n\n265\n00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.910\nSo once I actually get to boot it,\nthey'll look the same.\n\n266\n00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.120\nThe difference is just where that\ninstallation is coming from.\n\n267\n00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.870\nWhether it's via the Internet or\nwhether it's via my own USB key, right?\n\n268\n00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.950\nSo it's gonna fire up, and\nthen we'll get into recovery.\n\n269\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.700\nNow, what are we gonna\ndo once we get there?\n\n270\n00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.748\nOnce we actually get into recovery,\n\n271\n00:12:53.748 --> 00:12:57.131\nwhat we need to do is find out\nwhat happened to our hard drive.\n\n272\n00:12:57.131 --> 00:13:00.566\n&gt;&gt; Don, so when you're in recovery, how\ncan you tell if it's an actual hard drive\n\n273\n00:13:00.566 --> 00:13:03.299\nfailure or if it's just the software\nthat's having an issue?\n\n274\n00:13:03.299 --> 00:13:05.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's something that\nwe're gonna have to figure out right\n\n275\n00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:06.243\naway, right?\n\n276\n00:13:06.243 --> 00:13:09.305\nBecause if it's a software problem,\nwe can easily fix it ourselves.\n\n277\n00:13:09.305 --> 00:13:11.651\nIf it's a hardware problem,\nnow we gotta replace equipment.\n\n278\n00:13:11.651 --> 00:13:14.032\nWe might have to get Apple involved,\nand it's a bigger pain.\n\n279\n00:13:14.032 --> 00:13:15.199\nSo we need to figure that out, and\n\n280\n00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:17.008\nfortunately there's a pretty\neasy way to do that.\n\n281\n00:13:17.008 --> 00:13:21.055\nWhen you boot into Recovery, you're gonna\nsee the standard screen like we saw,\n\n282\n00:13:21.055 --> 00:13:22.855\nwhen we doing the install, right?\n\n283\n00:13:22.855 --> 00:13:24.162\nSo this one should be booted by now.\n\n284\n00:13:24.162 --> 00:13:25.636\nAnd yup, there we go.\n\n285\n00:13:25.636 --> 00:13:29.370\nSo, I can see this finish booting and\nit's giving me the standard options.\n\n286\n00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.520\nAnd we've got the Disk Utility for\n\n287\n00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.730\njumping in and finding out what\nhappened on the disk, right?\n\n288\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.650\nNow, on the Disk Utility,\nif you bring it up,\n\n289\n00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.833\nyou're gonna see the partitions\nthat are on there.\n\n290\n00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:43.112\nAnd in the last episode,\nI showed like erasing the disk, and\n\n291\n00:13:43.112 --> 00:13:44.795\npartitioning the disk.\n\n292\n00:13:44.795 --> 00:13:46.287\nI don't wanna do all that stuff.\n\n293\n00:13:46.287 --> 00:13:48.605\nI wanna find out what's\nwrong with this disk.\n\n294\n00:13:48.605 --> 00:13:53.025\nSo when I choose Macintosh HD,\nnow, I guess right off the bat,\n\n295\n00:13:53.025 --> 00:13:57.130\nwhen I look at this, the fact that\nthe disk shows up is a good sign.\n\n296\n00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.460\nI see the Apple hard disk drive, right?\n\n297\n00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.570\nI know that it's there.\n\n298\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.720\nSo that's a good sign.\n\n299\n00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.720\nIf the drive doesn't even show up,\n\n300\n00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.970\nthen the odds are you've got\na failed physical hard drive.\n\n301\n00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.700\nNext are the partitions.\n\n302\n00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.570\nI see the partitions and\nthey have their labels, right?\n\n303\n00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.990\nOne's called Macintosh HD,\none's called Storage.\n\n304\n00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.160\nIf the partition shows up and\n\n305\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.530\nit has no label,\nthat's an indicator of disk corruption.\n\n306\n00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.970\nNot necessarily physical failure, but\n\n307\n00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.580\na data corruption of the file table,\nor something of that nature.\n\n308\n00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.270\nAnd those can be repaired, right?\n\n309\n00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:33.884\nWhen you choose these disks and you\nlook at the basic information over here,\n\n310\n00:14:33.884 --> 00:14:37.993\nwe can actually run a quick scan on\nthese to find out what's wrong and\n\n311\n00:14:37.993 --> 00:14:40.318\nsee if we can't repair them, right?\n\n312\n00:14:40.318 --> 00:14:43.520\nIf there was disk corruption from\na power outage like mine, right?\n\n313\n00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.810\nYank the power cable,\nwe can usually come in here and fix that.\n\n314\n00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.220\nSo you'll notice this little button\nup here that says First Aid.\n\n315\n00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.640\nFirst Aid will scan the disk and\nlook for failures.\n\n316\n00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.885\nIn previous version of MacOS, you actually\nhad two different buttons, one for\n\n317\n00:14:56.885 --> 00:14:58.300\nanalyzing and one for repairing.\n\n318\n00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.345\nNow, they just combine it all\ntogether right into First Aid.\n\n319\n00:15:01.345 --> 00:15:08.030\nAnd we can check a partition, and\nyou can check the disk as a whole.\n\n320\n00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.250\nNow, that's important.\n\n321\n00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.801\nWhen I do First Aid on a disk as a whole,\nthat's gonna check the boot record versus\n\n322\n00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:16.056\nwhen I check the individual partition,\nwhere it's just looking there.\n\n323\n00:15:16.056 --> 00:15:19.643\nSo, if I see where my partitions\nare missing their labels,\n\n324\n00:15:19.643 --> 00:15:23.370\nI probably wanna run First Aid\non the disk as a whole.\n\n325\n00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.920\nBut if the partitions are showing up okay\nand she's not finding Operating System,\n\n326\n00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.710\nI might choose the partition itself and\nrun First Aid from there.\n\n327\n00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.190\nSo a little bit of variation.\n\n328\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.540\nI'll choose the disk and\nhit that First Aid button.\n\n329\n00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:39.220\nNow, it's gonna offer to come through and\nscan and look for any failures on the disk\n\n330\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.310\nand trying to repair which going on there\nand see if it can fix it up for us.\n\n331\n00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.983\nSo when we run that scan,\nit takes a moment, right?\n\n332\n00:15:44.983 --> 00:15:48.314\nIt's basically looking for errors on\nthe disk, trying to find a problem.\n\n333\n00:15:48.314 --> 00:15:50.192\nMine came back fine, right?\n\n334\n00:15:50.192 --> 00:15:54.849\nSo that right there should rule\nout a physical hard drive problem.\n\n335\n00:15:54.849 --> 00:15:55.745\nThe hard drive shows up.\n\n336\n00:15:55.745 --> 00:15:58.837\nAnd it passed the First Aid test,\nso I don't have a problem there.\n\n337\n00:15:58.837 --> 00:16:01.668\nIf I move down to\nthe individual partition,\n\n338\n00:16:01.668 --> 00:16:03.885\nI can run first data on it as well and\n\n339\n00:16:03.885 --> 00:16:09.420\nwe can run what is effectively the same\nscan but just on the partition itself.\n\n340\n00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.050\nAnd this one's gonna scan and notice\nhow it's taking a little bit longer.\n\n341\n00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.050\nIt's checking files,\nit's also checking permissions, and\n\n342\n00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.050\nmaking sure that the file\npermissions are set right.\n\n343\n00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.100\nThat what takes it so much longer.\n\n344\n00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.700\nHere's it's looking for\nmore like software issues.\n\n345\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.230\nAnd mine actually came back\nwith a green check mark here.\n\n346\n00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:29.340\nSo I didn't have disk corruption or\na hard drive failure.\n\n347\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.510\nIn my case, it's really just upset cuz I\nyanked the power plug while it was halfway\n\n348\n00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.370\nthrough installing Sierra.\n\n349\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.420\nBut you might find where there were\npermissions issues that stopped you from\n\n350\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.000\ngetting the files or\nwhere there's data corruption.\n\n351\n00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.890\nAnd it would detect that and\ntry and clean that up.\n\n352\n00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:48.030\nNow, in my scenario, because I yanked the\npower plug halfway through the install,\n\n353\n00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.280\nthe Sierra operating system\nitself is actually damaged.\n\n354\n00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.630\nSo while I don't have a physical\nhard drive problem, and\n\n355\n00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.040\nI don't have a logical hard drive problem,\nI do have a data problem.\n\n356\n00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.770\nAnd that's why my data is missing.\n\n357\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.200\nRight, I'm missing part\nof my operating system.\n\n358\n00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.290\nSo Disk Utility can't fix that for me.\n\n359\n00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.640\nBut the installer can, right?\n\n360\n00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.520\nSo what I need to do now\nis get out of Disk Utility.\n\n361\n00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.650\nWe used Disk Utility to solve any of\nthe disk issues that we might have.\n\n362\n00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:18.250\nAnd now we can see Restore\nfrom Time Machine Backup.\n\n363\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.640\nOr Install Mac OS, right?\n\n364\n00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.690\nNow Restore from Time Machine Backup\nwould really be the ideal situation.\n\n365\n00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.820\nIf you ever have a damaged system and\nyou're not sure\n\n366\n00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.860\nwhether things are properly recovered or\nif things are corrupt, if you can restore\n\n367\n00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.940\nfrom Time Machine, you'll know that\nall of your data is put back right.\n\n368\n00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.780\nAnd Time Machine runs a backup every hour,\nso\n\n369\n00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.350\nas long as you had your drive connected,\n\n370\n00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:43.100\nyou'll have your data up to within an hour\nof the failure, that's pretty good.\n\n371\n00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.420\nThat's usually what you wanna do.\n\n372\n00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.040\nBut this was a new machine for me.\n\n373\n00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.180\nI don't have a Time Machine backup for it.\n\n374\n00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.620\nOr we were teasing Wes\nearlier because Wes,\n\n375\n00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.740\nhow many days has it been since\nyour Time Machine backup?\n\n376\n00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.580\n&gt;&gt; I shouldn't say probably live.\n\n377\n00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.250\nAbout 26 to 28.\n\n378\n00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.620\nAlmost a month.\n\n379\n00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.060\n&gt;&gt; Almost a month.\n\n380\n00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.103\nSo if it's been a month,\n\n381\n00:18:00.103 --> 00:18:03.497\nyou don't wanna recover from a Time\nMachine backup that's a month old, right?\n\n382\n00:18:03.497 --> 00:18:05.760\nSo you can do the next step.\n\n383\n00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.600\nNow, mine says install Mac OS, right?\n\n384\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.390\nAnd that's because my Mac OS is damaged.\n\n385\n00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.670\nDamaged to the point that it can't be\nrecovered, so it's saying install it.\n\n386\n00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.544\nNow, because there's already data on\nthe drive, it's gonna see that and\n\n387\n00:18:18.544 --> 00:18:19.970\nit will leave my data there, right?\n\n388\n00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.450\nSo it's not gonna format the disk like\nwe did in the installation episode.\n\n389\n00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:28.370\nSo I can fix my broken operating\nsystem by choose the install option.\n\n390\n00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.547\nNow if my installation had completed and\nnow it's just corrupt,\n\n391\n00:18:31.547 --> 00:18:33.640\nthis option would actually be different.\n\n392\n00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.804\nIt would say reinstall Mac OS, right?\n\n393\n00:18:36.804 --> 00:18:38.520\nBecause it sees the operating system.\n\n394\n00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.810\nIt knows that it's there.\n\n395\n00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.520\nIt's just gonna reinstall it.\n\n396\n00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.500\nReinstalling is gonna\nreplace all the files,\n\n397\n00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.170\nin case one of the files became corrupted.\n\n398\n00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.720\nIt's gonna fix them, all right?\n\n399\n00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.610\nSo slight variation in the terminology\nthere, but the same end result.\n\n400\n00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:54.430\nIt's gonna put the operating system back\non the system, and get it fixed up and\n\n401\n00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:55.620\nready to go.\n\n402\n00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.390\nNow when you choose to reinstall, or\n\n403\n00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.320\nyou choose to install,\nthe options are pretty much the same.\n\n404\n00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.070\nIn fact the only real difference\nbetween the install and\n\n405\n00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:09.990\nthe reinstall is going to be whether or\nnot I see the drive selection screen.\n\n406\n00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.610\nIf I choose to reinstall,\nit already knows what drive to install on.\n\n407\n00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.710\nIf I don't choose to reinstall,\nif I choose a regular install,\n\n408\n00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.220\nthen it's gonna ask me to pick\nwhich drive I'm installing on.\n\n409\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.710\nSo I'll actually get the choice to pick\nhere because I never let the installation\n\n410\n00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:27.230\nfinish in the first place, so it's\na little variation that we'll get there.\n\n411\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:31.132\nBut the nice part here is when it does\nthis it knows the disk is already\n\n412\n00:19:31.132 --> 00:19:34.621\nformatted and knows that's it's\nalready files on there and\n\n413\n00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:36.409\nit's not going to erase them.\n\n414\n00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:40.780\nIt's just going to move along and\ncopy the operating system back on there.\n\n415\n00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.950\nIf the operating system were older, right,\n\n416\n00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:47.840\nlet's say I was running Yosemite and\nI had an operating system failure.\n\n417\n00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.520\nWell I could actually\ntake a Sierra boot media.\n\n418\n00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.460\nBoot off of it and\nchoose to install Sierra and not\n\n419\n00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.210\nonly am I repairing the operating system\nbut I'm upgrading it at the same time.\n\n420\n00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.390\nYou can do both.\n\n421\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:02.130\nI don't usually recommend that because you\nmight have a problem that comes about from\n\n422\n00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.580\nthe upgrade and now you don't know,\nwas it corrupted data or\n\n423\n00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.340\nwas it the upgrade that\ncaused the problem, right?\n\n424\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.550\nToo many changes.\n\n425\n00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.050\nSo ideally if you have a Yosemite machine\n\n426\n00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:14.110\nthat you use a Yosemite recovery disk,\nright?\n\n427\n00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:17.820\nOr if it's an El Capitan machine you\nuse an El Capitan recovery disk.\n\n428\n00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:22.090\nI make a habit of always saving\nthe installers for OS 10.\n\n429\n00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:26.990\nSo I have a Dropbox or\nUSB drive where I store these things, and\n\n430\n00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:32.630\nI've got Mavericks, El Capitan,\nYosemite, all of these older OS's.\n\n431\n00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.510\nNot because I'm gonna install them new but\nif I ever need to recover a machine that\n\n432\n00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.590\nhadn't been upgraded I'll use\nthem to build the USB key.\n\n433\n00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:44.020\nI'll use the little create install media\nscript to create the USB key so I have\n\n434\n00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.210\nthe appropriate disk for the operating\nsystem that somebody was running.\n\n435\n00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.310\nBut the reality is you\ncan use the latest one.\n\n436\n00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.800\nIf you have the Sierra media\nyou can use that on any system.\n\n437\n00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.610\nAnd use that to recover,\nget it back up and going and\n\n438\n00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.120\nnow your operating system is up.\n\n439\n00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.440\nYour applications are there,\nyour data is there, and you recover.\n\n440\n00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.600\nObviously if this was a hardware\nproblem I would have needed to\n\n441\n00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.820\nreplace the disk first.\n\n442\n00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.010\nThen we run through this process and if\nyou replace the disk you kind of lost your\n\n443\n00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:12.230\ndata so you're gonna have to recover that\nfrom the Time Machine backup anyway.\n\n444\n00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.511\nAnd that's where the restore from\nTime Machine option comes in handy.\n\n445\n00:21:14.511 --> 00:21:21.321\nAll right, couple of other\nthings worth mentioning here.\n\n446\n00:21:21.321 --> 00:21:23.575\nIf it was memory that was the problem,\n\n447\n00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:26.966\nmemory can sometimes manifest\nitself as a disk failure.\n\n448\n00:21:26.966 --> 00:21:29.761\nYou might think you have disk failure and\nin actuality it's memory.\n\n449\n00:21:29.761 --> 00:21:33.712\nSo for example when you copy a file to\nyour hard drive you maybe you have a file\n\n450\n00:21:33.712 --> 00:21:34.940\non a USB disk.\n\n451\n00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.690\nAnd you copy it over and\nyou copy it to the hard drive.\n\n452\n00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.700\nAnd then you go open it on the hard\ndrive and it says the file's corrupt.\n\n453\n00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.350\nOr you download a file from the Internet\nand then you go to open it and\n\n454\n00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:43.020\nit says it's corrupt.\n\n455\n00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.970\nAnd you start thinking wow, maybe I\nhave some bad sectors on the hard drive.\n\n456\n00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.340\nWell, what happens is anytime you\ncopy a file to the hard drive,\n\n457\n00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.410\nit gets copied to RAM first.\n\n458\n00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:54.310\nAnd then from RAM it gets\nwritten to the hard drive.\n\n459\n00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.570\nIf your RAM is bad, the file that\ngets copied to RAM is now corrupt and\n\n460\n00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.280\nit gets written to the disk corrupt.\n\n461\n00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.395\nAnd so it looks like it's corrupt on disk\nwhen its actually the RAM that's causing\n\n462\n00:22:03.395 --> 00:22:03.948\nthe problem.\n\n463\n00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:08.645\nIf I do this reinstall and it completes\nthe Sierra install and I boot up and\n\n464\n00:22:08.645 --> 00:22:12.584\nI still have the problem,\nI might actually have bad memory.\n\n465\n00:22:12.584 --> 00:22:16.400\nAnd so I might need to boot up into\nthe hardware diagnostics to check that.\n\n466\n00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.150\nOn most Macs, not all of them, but most.\n\n467\n00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.882\nYou can boot while holding Cmd+D.\n\n468\n00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:24.950\nAnd Cmd+D will load into\na special diagnostic mode,\n\n469\n00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:27.290\nwhere it runs a series of hardware checks.\n\n470\n00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:30.730\nAnd it can diagnose some fine problems\nthat you can't otherwise find.\n\n471\n00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.210\nSo for example, my laptop.\n\n472\n00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.927\nI would show you but\nit's actually fixed now [LAUGH].\n\n473\n00:22:35.927 --> 00:22:39.310\nMy laptop, I noticed one day,\nthe headphone jack stopped working.\n\n474\n00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:42.045\nI'd plug in my headphones and\nI would just hear static, [SOUND].\n\n475\n00:22:42.045 --> 00:22:43.580\nIt was bad.\n\n476\n00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.470\nAnd I noticed that I didn't even\nsee the volume slider on my Mac.\n\n477\n00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:52.150\nAnd so the speakers on the Mac wouldn't\nwork, not just the headphone jack, but\n\n478\n00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.040\nthe speakers themselves wouldn't work.\n\n479\n00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.350\nIt was as if the sound\ncard wasn't even there.\n\n480\n00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.405\nWell, I booted in the diagnostic mode.\n\n481\n00:23:00.405 --> 00:23:03.150\nAnd in the diagnostic mode, it ran\nthrough a series of hardware checks.\n\n482\n00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.810\nAnd it said, you've got a problem\nwith your sound hardware.\n\n483\n00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:09.870\nAnd it gave me a code, and so\nwhen I called Apple for support,\n\n484\n00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.213\nI said hey I ran diagnostics,\nI got this code.\n\n485\n00:23:12.213 --> 00:23:14.566\nI told them the code and they say,\nyep that's the sound card,\n\n486\n00:23:14.566 --> 00:23:15.796\nwe'll replace it on warranty.\n\n487\n00:23:15.796 --> 00:23:17.560\nThey changed it and that was that.\n\n488\n00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.500\nI was able to diagnose exactly\nwhat that problem was.\n\n489\n00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.224\nIt diagnoses memory as well.\n\n490\n00:23:23.224 --> 00:23:27.540\nSo holding Cmd+D to boot into that\ndiagnostic mode, that is a great way to be\n\n491\n00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.270\nable to jump in there and\ncheck that hardware before you call Apple.\n\n492\n00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.920\nSo you actually have\nthe hardware code to give them.\n\n493\n00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.400\nOtherwise if you take it to the Apple\nstore they don't like to say this but\n\n494\n00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.500\nthat's actually what they do.\n\n495\n00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.775\nThey just boot it holding Cmd+D.\n\n496\n00:23:38.775 --> 00:23:42.010\n[LAUGH] That's the Apple\ngenius technique right there,\n\n497\n00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.450\nI just ruined the whole secret.\n\n498\n00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.450\nAnd then once they have the code\nthey know, yeah it's this hardware.\n\n499\n00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:47.970\nThey replace it and that's the end of it.\n\n500\n00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:52.340\nSo, pretty easy to recover from\na failed operating system.\n\n501\n00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.760\nYour failed data is\na different story though,\n\n502\n00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.790\nI can easily put the CRL OS back on here\nas long as I have my recovery media.\n\n503\n00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.590\nBut if I lost some of my data,\nthat's where your Time Machine comes in.\n\n504\n00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:06.208\nYou really need to make sure you've got\ngood Time Machine backups or that you use\n\n505\n00:24:06.208 --> 00:24:09.778\ncloud services like iCloud and Dropbox\nto backup your data to a cloud service.\n\n506\n00:24:09.778 --> 00:24:12.484\nAnd that way, if you ever have\nto replace your hard drive,\n\n507\n00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:16.210\nyou just re-download your data from\nthe cloud, and you're back in business.\n\n508\n00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:19.000\nAll right, as far as OS recovery,\nI think it's about it.\n\n509\n00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.710\nI mention Mountain Lion,\nhow it has its different recovery.\n\n510\n00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.660\nHopefully, none of you are running\nMountain Lion anymore.\n\n511\n00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.230\nBut, you can just go to Apple's website,\ndownload that recovery,\n\n512\n00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.240\nthat's easy enough.\n\n513\n00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.750\nThe other thing is when you're\nin the recovery window,\n\n514\n00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.480\nthere's other utilities\nthat are available.\n\n515\n00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.380\nI've talked a bit about some\nof them in the last episode.\n\n516\n00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.880\nBut if you go to\nthe Utilities menu up top,\n\n517\n00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.890\nyou'll see things like your firmware\npassword utility and a few other things.\n\n518\n00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:43.860\nBut most importantly you'll see Terminal.\n\n519\n00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.660\nYou can drop to the Terminal and\ndo all sorts of stuff.\n\n520\n00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.900\nFor example, you could pop in\na USB hard drive and mount it.\n\n521\n00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.140\nAnd from there, you might be able to copy\ndata from your hard drive to the USB drive\n\n522\n00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.510\nto make a last minute, a last ditch back\nup of your data before formatting it.\n\n523\n00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.190\nThose are some of the things you\ncan do once you're in the Terminal.\n\n524\n00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.040\nIt's harder to work in the Terminal,\nbut at least it's there,\n\n525\n00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.690\nat least you can get into it, and\nit's right there as part of recovery.\n\n526\n00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:10.122\nSo just be aware there's all these\nutilities that are out there for you.\n\n527\n00:25:10.122 --> 00:25:12.730\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, a lot of great\ninformation on how to get that operating\n\n528\n00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.770\nsystem back up and\nrunning through recovery but\n\n529\n00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.280\nwhat we can't seem to recover here\nis a few extra minutes on the clock.\n\n530\n00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.127\nSo it does look like we're going\nto have to wrap this one up here.\n\n531\n00:25:20.127 --> 00:25:23.546\nBut before we do, when it comes to OS\nrecovery do you have any parting words you\n\n532\n00:25:23.546 --> 00:25:24.926\nwant to impart in our viewers?\n\n533\n00:25:24.926 --> 00:25:27.226\n&gt;&gt; The main thing that\nI would recommend is,\n\n534\n00:25:27.226 --> 00:25:31.378\nwhile your system is healthy while\nit's happy, create an install media.\n\n535\n00:25:31.378 --> 00:25:37.075\nUSB keys are cheap, they're $15 for\na 16 gig one, pretty easy anywhere.\n\n536\n00:25:37.075 --> 00:25:40.983\nBuy one, make the recovery media and stick\nin a drawer in your desk, have it handy.\n\n537\n00:25:40.983 --> 00:25:44.137\nThat way when there's a failure you\ncan easily just grab that media and\n\n538\n00:25:44.137 --> 00:25:44.842\nboot off of it.\n\n539\n00:25:44.842 --> 00:25:48.629\nIf you only have one Mac that's really\nimportant, cuz if I have two Macs, and\n\n540\n00:25:48.629 --> 00:25:52.780\nmine fails, I can just go to Wes' laptop,\nand make the recovery media from his.\n\n541\n00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.370\nAnd now I can come over and fix mine.\n\n542\n00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:58.460\nBut if you've only got one Mac,\nit takes a Mac to make the recovery media.\n\n543\n00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.730\nYou can't make it from a Windows or\na Linux machine.\n\n544\n00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.780\nSo make the recovery media while you\nstill have a functioning device.\n\n545\n00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.130\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, words of wisdom.\n\n546\n00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:06.710\nThank you there.\n\n547\n00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.890\nAnd we appreciate you,\nthe viewer watching.\n\n548\n00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:10.040\nSigning out for ITProTV.\n\n549\n00:26:10.040

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:14.460\n&gt;&gt; All right,\ngreetings everyone welcome to another\n\n5\n00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.050\n&gt;&gt; Another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.550\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.420\nAnd in today's episode, well we\nare continuing out with more of our\n\n8\n00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.310\nACSP Series,\nthe Apple certified support professional.\n\n9\n00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.190\nAnd joining us in the studio is the most\nprofessional of us all, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.950\nDon, welcome back, man.\n\n11\n00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.630\nHow's it going today.\n\n12\n00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.070\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit's hard to pretend we're professional,\n\n13\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.302\nwe just spend our morning\ntalking about total recall.\n\n14\n00:00:34.302 --> 00:00:35.248\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:36.511\n&gt;&gt; That's legitimate film, man.\n\n16\n00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:37.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right\n\n17\n00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.350\n&gt;&gt; Speaking of legitimate film though,\n\n18\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.760\nin this episode we're gonna be kicking\noff the inital setup of a new Mac.\n\n19\n00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.530\nNow if you've been watching all these\nepisodes in order then you know one of\n\n20\n00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.220\nthe last things we did was show how to\nerase and install MacOS on a new system.\n\n21\n00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.060\nWell that's all fine and\ngood if you're at that point, but\n\n22\n00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.350\neven if you're just starting\noff with this episode.\n\n23\n00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.720\nWhen you fire up a brand new Mac, or you\njust erased one and reinstalled Mac OS,\n\n24\n00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.420\nit always goes to the point that we're\ngonna start at right here in the show.\n\n25\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.110\nYou push the power button,\nyou see the little Apple logo pop up,\n\n26\n00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.050\nthe little status bar goes across.\n\n27\n00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.100\nAnd then it goes into\nan initial set up wizard.\n\n28\n00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.140\nThe things we need to do\nto get our system set up.\n\n29\n00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.980\nNow you'll find there's a number of\ndifferent choices spread throughout this,\n\n30\n00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.540\nand Apple actually does have a prescribed\nmethodology for what you should be doing\n\n31\n00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.370\nto get these new systems put in place and\nconfigured the way that you want them.\n\n32\n00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.440\nSo in this episode, we're gonna run\nthrough each of those different options\n\n33\n00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.690\nand talk about what they mean, when we use\nthem, what scenarios they're meant for,\n\n34\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.220\nand what we need to do to make sure\nthat we get our Mac up and running.\n\n35\n00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.070\nAs quickly and painlessly as possible.\n\n36\n00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.540\nSo we can be out there in the field, and\n\n37\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.240\nactually being productive and\nprofessional right?\n\n38\n00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.540\nVersus, we're standing around waiting\non a status bar to scroll across and\n\n39\n00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.825\ntalking about total recall.\n\n40\n00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:52.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well there's worst ways to spend that\n\n41\n00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.655\ntime, right everyone?\n\n42\n00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:57.620\n[LAUGH] That being said Don, what\nare these basic steps which Apple says,\n\n43\n00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.330\nthat we're gonna walk\nourselves through here?\n\n44\n00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.080\nOkay, so they've got five steps, and\nthey don't necessarily have to be done in\n\n45\n00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.200\norder, sometimes they\ncan't be done in order.\n\n46\n00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.960\nBut the first one is we need\nto migrate data, right?\n\n47\n00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.940\nIf you just got a new Mac,\nthe odds are you had an old Mac.\n\n48\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.870\nAnd you need to be able to get your data\nfrom the old Mac over to the new Mac.\n\n49\n00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.430\nOr, hey, maybe you're making the switch,\nmaybe you had a Windows machine.\n\n50\n00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.730\nAnd you need to get your data off\nthe Windows machine and over to your Mac.\n\n51\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.670\nIt's very rare that you have\nsomebody who's starting out with\n\n52\n00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.250\ntheir very first computer with absolutely\nno historical data whatsoever.\n\n53\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.100\nI'm just going to start out from scratch.\n\n54\n00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.270\nI think we all did that at some point but.\n\n55\n00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.360\nKids these days get their first\ncomputer when they're like\n\n56\n00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.732\neight years old and or even younger.\n\n57\n00:02:37.732 --> 00:02:38.232\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n58\n00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:40.402\nJust don't know a day without some sort of\n\n59\n00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:41.360\nelectronic history.\n\n60\n00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that screen.\n\n61\n00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.960\nSo, it's pretty rare that\nyou start out with nothing.\n\n62\n00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.570\nSo, you've got data we\nyou need to get over.\n\n63\n00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.260\nSo that's step one.\n\n64\n00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.690\nIs just kinda migrating our data.\n\n65\n00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.000\nWell I can't migrate my data to\nthis computer right now because\n\n66\n00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.480\nit's sitting at its set-up screen.\n\n67\n00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.650\nI've got to get through the set-up first.\n\n68\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.440\nSo that's why I say they aren't\nnecessarily going to be done\n\n69\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.090\nin the order that Apple has them.\n\n70\n00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.130\nThe next thing is configuring networking.\n\n71\n00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.950\nIt's very rare these days that we use\na computer that's not networked and\n\n72\n00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.270\nthat didn't use to be true.\n\n73\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.400\nI mean, I remember buying my\nfirst network adaptor in,\n\n74\n00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.420\nit was probably like 1996, but prior to\nthat my computers weren't network, right?\n\n75\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.460\nThey were stand-alone\nindependent machines.\n\n76\n00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.700\nBut in today's world,\n\n77\n00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.350\nto encounter a machine that doesn't have\ninternet access is like a broken machine.\n\n78\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.500\nWhat's wrong with this thing?\n\n79\n00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.540\nI can't get on the internet.\n\n80\n00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.780\nSo, we need to get configured for\nthe network, right?\n\n81\n00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.680\nWe've got configure user accounts\nduring the setup it's going an create\n\n82\n00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.550\none user account for you that user\ngoing and be a administrator,\n\n83\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.730\nyou may need to create other user\naccounts if you share the computer and\n\n84\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.160\nthey might be administrators also.\n\n85\n00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.367\nThey might be regular users but\nwe need get those done and put in place.\n\n86\n00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:48.920\nThen we got adjusting our general\nsetting preferences when MacOS fires up.\n\n87\n00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.030\nApple is configured it to what they think\nis the base standard for most people.\n\n88\n00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.140\nThe settings that are appropriate,\nand keep most people happy.\n\n89\n00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.270\nBut, different people\nhave different needs.\n\n90\n00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.270\nThere's people like me, where I really\nhate the flashy bells and whistles and\n\n91\n00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.850\nI turn a lot of stuff off, right?\n\n92\n00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.450\nI'll turn off a lot of settings to make\nthings a little more streamlined but\n\n93\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.730\na little faster.\n\n94\n00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.610\nAnd I am not afraid of\ndropping to a terminal.\n\n95\n00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.670\nThere's other people\nthat hate the terminal.\n\n96\n00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.920\nThey want everything in the GUI and\nthey customize things and\n\n97\n00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.310\nmake it work in a certain way.\n\n98\n00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.120\nDifferent people\nare different preferences.\n\n99\n00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.210\nAnd we need to be able to go in and\nget those configured and setup, right.\n\n100\n00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.590\nSo we adjust things the way\nthat we want them to be.\n\n101\n00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.640\nAnd then lastly,\nwe need to configure software updates.\n\n102\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.300\nMac OS is very stable and very secure.\n\n103\n00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.240\nAnd the reason it is those two things\nis that Apple very reliably pushes out\n\n104\n00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.690\nupdates on a regular basis,\nif you're set up to receive them.\n\n105\n00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.630\nIf you don't set yourself up for\n\n106\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.070\nthat, then you could be running an older\nversion of Mac OS, and a virus or\n\n107\n00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.310\nan attack or something like that\ncould be out there on the network.\n\n108\n00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.450\nAnd you're not vulnerable to it, because\nyou haven't been doing updates, right?\n\n109\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.120\nInteresting thing,\nyou hear a lot of people say, hey,\n\n110\n00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.890\nyou don't need antivirus\nsoftware on your Mac, right?\n\n111\n00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.060\nAnd by in large,\nthat's true if you're doing your updates.\n\n112\n00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.340\nBecause anytime there's some\nkinda exploit or a weakness or\n\n113\n00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.220\na whatever Apple will patch it and\npush it out as part of their updates.\n\n114\n00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.890\nSo Apple acts as your antivirus.\n\n115\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.860\nThey are stopping these type\nof exploits from working.\n\n116\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.640\nBut if you're not doing the updates,\nthen Apple's not helping you.\n\n117\n00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.720\nAnd if they're not helping you,\nyou're not helping yourself.\n\n118\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.484\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n119\n00:05:25.484 --> 00:05:26.418\n&gt;&gt; Then you do need something\n\n120\n00:05:26.418 --> 00:05:26.970\nlike antivirus.\n\n121\n00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.666\nAnd there are products out\nthere that you can get.\n\n122\n00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:30.746\nBut you shouldn't need them\nif you're doing your updates.\n\n123\n00:05:30.746 --> 00:05:32.300\nSo getting your updates configured.\n\n124\n00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.080\nIt's kind of that fifth step.\n\n125\n00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.780\nThey're all very important,\nyou might do them all at once.\n\n126\n00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.280\nHey, I just got a new computer, let me run\nthrough all five of these steps right now.\n\n127\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.780\nOr you might do them slowly over a week or\ntwo weeks as you get things set up.\n\n128\n00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.240\nThat's your option when\nit's just your computer.\n\n129\n00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.920\nBut if you're at a business and\nyou just received 100 new MacBooks and\n\n130\n00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.310\nyou're suppose to be distributing\nthem out to the instruments agents,\n\n131\n00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.650\nsomething like that You don't\nwanna take weeks or months.\n\n132\n00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.740\nYou wanna get this done\nas quickly as possible.\n\n133\n00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.650\nSo understanding the tools that\nare available to speed this up\n\n134\n00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.600\nwill really help make this\nan effective operation and work.\n\n135\n00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.900\n&gt;&gt; All right Don real quickly, the process\nthat we're getting ready to go through.\n\n136\n00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.290\nIs it the same if you have a new Mac\nversus whether or not You reinstall it, or\n\n137\n00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.460\nare they two different processes?\n\n138\n00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's kinda the nice part\nabout it, is it is the same, right?\n\n139\n00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.250\nOnce you've reinstalled Mac OS,\n\n140\n00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.660\nit's in the same state as if\nyou had just bought a new Mac.\n\n141\n00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.170\nSo what we're gonna see from here on out,\n\n142\n00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.470\nthe screen that I'm on right now, is what\nyou're greeted with regardless, right?\n\n143\n00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.280\nSo when I come in here,\n\n144\n00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.480\nthe first thing it's gonna ask me\nis what country I'm in, right?\n\n145\n00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.850\nSo it needs to isolate a country, so it\ncan figure out the language and the other\n\n146\n00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.870\nsettings that go along with firing up\nthat new system and getting it in place.\n\n147\n00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.300\nNow, it's defaulting to the United States\nfor me, which is convenient,\n\n148\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.490\ncuz that's where I am.\n\n149\n00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.500\nAnd I can move forward on that, and\nnow I get to select my keyboard.\n\n150\n00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.340\nNow, you might be wondering why\nthese settings are important.\n\n151\n00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.060\nIf you've only lived in the US,\nwe get a little spoiled here,\n\n152\n00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.950\nbecause a lot of computers,\nespecially the ones you purchase here,\n\n153\n00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.360\nare all set up for us,\nright out of the box.\n\n154\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.010\nBut if you travel to other countries,\nyou'll find that things are different.\n\n155\n00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.415\nWell, I mean, they're other countries.\n\n156\n00:06:59.415 --> 00:07:01.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But even the computers are different,\n\n157\n00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.990\nespecially when it comes\nto keyboard layouts.\n\n158\n00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.230\nSo for example, on an English keyboard or\n\n159\n00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.730\na US English keyboard, the top row\nof letters on your keyboard is,\n\n160\n00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.030\nthey call it a QWERTY keyboard,\ncuz it's Q-W-E-R-T-Y, right, QWERTY.\n\n161\n00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.850\nBut if you go to France, that top row\nof the The keyboard is different.\n\n162\n00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.200\nIt's an AZERTY.\n\n163\n00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.210\nIt's A-Z-E-R-T-Y.\n\n164\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.530\nSo different layout.\n\n165\n00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.350\nSo if you pick the wrong keyboard then\nthings aren't gonna work out so well for\n\n166\n00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.700\nyou and it's really gonna be a pain.\n\n167\n00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.960\nSo when I look at my keyboard layout here,\nit's asking It's me to pick that,\n\n168\n00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.920\nand, I'm just gonna go with US\ncuz that's the city that I'm on.\n\n169\n00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.390\nBut if you choose show all,\nyou'll actually get a whole list and\n\n170\n00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.790\nsee we've got like AZ right there,\nor, Q-W-E-R-T-Z, A QWERTZ.\n\n171\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.690\nI don't know [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.570\n&gt;&gt; I would bet you the Dvorak is in\n\n173\n00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:46.360\nhere somewhere.\n\n174\n00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.350\nAlthough, you never know,\ncuz well, there they are, Dvorak.\n\n175\n00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.972\nYep, Apple doesn't actually\nsell any Dvorak keyboards.\n\n176\n00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:55.071\nBut you can get one and\nput it in the USB and you got it, right?\n\n177\n00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:57.067\nSo we need to be able to tell\nthe system what you've got.\n\n178\n00:07:57.067 --> 00:07:59.957\nAnd in my case, it's just US.\n\n179\n00:07:59.957 --> 00:08:02.682\nAll right, the other thing is\nthere's things like currency that\n\n180\n00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:03.730\nare different, right?\n\n181\n00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.507\nIn the US we use the dollar sign,\nin England they use the pound sign,\n\n182\n00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:10.150\nin Europe they use the Euro sign.\n\n183\n00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.835\nThere's also where we use a period,\nis a decimal point.\n\n184\n00:08:13.835 --> 00:08:15.885\nIn Europe,\nthey use a comma as a decimal point.\n\n185\n00:08:15.885 --> 00:08:18.865\nSo the different things of that nature.\n\n186\n00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:22.935\nBut then as we move forward, now it knows\nenough about getting our keyboard right,\n\n187\n00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:25.995\nso we can type things, and\nnow we can start to use the system.\n\n188\n00:08:25.995 --> 00:08:28.410\nNow, as part of the installation,\n\n189\n00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.000\nit's gonna bring us up to\nthis option right here.\n\n190\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.534\nThis is the migration Wizard and\n\n191\n00:08:32.534 --> 00:08:35.655\nthe migration Wizard was one of\nthe first things Apple listed.\n\n192\n00:08:35.655 --> 00:08:38.470\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Step one of our five steps was\n\n193\n00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.760\nmigrate previously existing data.\n\n194\n00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.180\nAnd you can do that to some extent.\n\n195\n00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.350\nThere's something that may\nnot quite be set up yet.\n\n196\n00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.900\nFor example,\nif I wanna transfer nothing, right?\n\n197\n00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.842\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I want to choose don't transfer any\n\n198\n00:08:51.842 --> 00:08:53.210\ninformation, that's set up right now.\n\n199\n00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.560\nI can hit Next.\n\n200\n00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.460\n&gt;&gt; Step one done.\n[LAUGH]\n\n201\n00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.320\n&gt;&gt; The other two options,\n\n202\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.830\ntransfer from a Mac or\ntransfer from a Windows PC.\n\n203\n00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.460\nThose are a little more challenging.\n\n204\n00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.820\nBecause for example to transfer from\na Windows PC I need a network connection\n\n205\n00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.150\nto the Windows PC.\n\n206\n00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.920\nWell has it offered to\nset up my network yet?\n\n207\n00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.770\nNo, so if the automatic network\nconfiguration works, then yes,\n\n208\n00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.420\nI'll be able to transfer\nfrom Windows PC right now.\n\n209\n00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.060\nBut if I still need to setup my network,\nI may need to wait and\n\n210\n00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.590\ncome back to this step later.\n\n211\n00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.250\nSo don't feel like Apple's five\nsteps have to be applied in order.\n\n212\n00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.950\nWe can always come back and\nchange and correct after the fact.\n\n213\n00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.490\nNow choosing from a Mac,\nsame kind of thing here.\n\n214\n00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.850\nIf I'm coming from another Mac and\nit's on the network with me.\n\n215\n00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.560\nI need to make sure my network is setup.\n\n216\n00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.660\nMy automatic settings might be enough, but\nif they aren't I'll need to get connected.\n\n217\n00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.618\nFrom a Windows PC, same thing.\n\n218\n00:09:42.618 --> 00:09:48.240\nI like how they choose the old\nstyle Windows icon there.\n\n219\n00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, and then don't transfer.\n\n220\n00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.650\nI'm gonna choose not to transfer for\nright now because we can\n\n221\n00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.130\nalways launch the transfer a little\nbit later, and I'll bring it over.\n\n222\n00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.380\nOne convenient thing about transferring\nit right from here though,\n\n223\n00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.910\nlet me just highlight a reason\nwhy you might wanna do this.\n\n224\n00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.570\nIt's gonna ask us to\ncreate a user account.\n\n225\n00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.480\nAnd when I create a user account,\n\n226\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.420\nI might create a user account called\nDon Pezet, because that's my name.\n\n227\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.140\nWell, if I come into the migration Wizard\nlater, and I migrate settings from\n\n228\n00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:19.180\na Windows PC, and there's a user account\non the Windows PC called Don Pezet?\n\n229\n00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.880\nIt won't let me migrate it because the\nname matches, I'll get a conflict, right?\n\n230\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.190\nSo if I want to bring that account over\nnow and just have that one account it's\n\n231\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.360\nbetter to migrate it right from here if\nyou can, but it's not always possible.\n\n232\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.048\nSo, I'm gonna choose not to tran transfer\nand the way to work around that?\n\n233\n00:10:34.048 --> 00:10:36.118\nIs for the first user account\nthat it has you create,\n\n234\n00:10:36.118 --> 00:10:37.681\njust give it a different name, right?\n\n235\n00:10:37.681 --> 00:10:38.626\nDon't give it a name for\n\n236\n00:10:38.626 --> 00:10:41.195\na user account that you're going\nto be migrating over later on.\n\n237\n00:10:41.195 --> 00:10:42.765\nAnd I don't normally do that anyway.\n\n238\n00:10:42.765 --> 00:10:46.175\nI usually create a help desk account and\nhave that on the system and then I can\n\n239\n00:10:46.175 --> 00:10:49.345\nmigrate my personal account over\nafterwards, if it's a business machine.\n\n240\n00:10:49.345 --> 00:10:51.374\nIf it's a home machine, you probably\ndon't need a help desk account.\n\n241\n00:10:51.374 --> 00:10:53.075\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; In which case\nyou'd just do the transfer now.\n\n242\n00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.950\nDo note that if transfer from a Mac,\n\n243\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.670\nyou can actually transfer\nfrom a time machine backup.\n\n244\n00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.110\nThat means we don't have to\nworry about network anymore,\n\n245\n00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.960\nyou just plug in a USB hard drive and\nit'll see the drive and\n\n246\n00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.230\nit'll use the time machine backup to bring\nall your setting over onto the new system.\n\n247\n00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:11.190\nNeat part about that is it's not\nactually doing a time machine restore.\n\n248\n00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:16.620\nSo I might have a time machine backup\nthat's running, Mac OS Yosemite or\n\n249\n00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:17.700\nEl Capitan.\n\n250\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.550\nAnd here's my system running Sierra.\n\n251\n00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.960\nWell it's just bringing my\nsettings over from the backup, so\n\n252\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.860\nI'm still running Sierra.\n\n253\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.860\nIt doesn't downgrade me to the old OS.\n\n254\n00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.400\nIf I were to boot to recovery and\nrestore from time machine,\n\n255\n00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.000\nit would downgrade me to the old OS.\n\n256\n00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.640\nSo it is different doing it\nfrom the migration Wizard\n\n257\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.561\nversus using the actual\ntime machine restore.\n\n258\n00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:37.550\nAlright, so I'm going to go ahead and skip\nthat for now though, and move forward.\n\n259\n00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.200\nIt's going to ask if I want\nto enable location services.\n\n260\n00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.020\nI could turn that on.\n\n261\n00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.290\nI'm going to leave it off because\nI don't have a GPS anyway, so\n\n262\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.400\nit's not really going to help.\n\n263\n00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.060\nAnd I'll tell it that I\ndon't want to use that.\n\n264\n00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.540\nAnd then if I want to sign\nin with my Apple ID, right?\n\n265\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.320\nNow if I sign in with my Apple ID,\n\n266\n00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.200\nthere's many settings that are gonna\ncome down from there, also, right?\n\n267\n00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.210\nSo again,\nit kind of makes that migration easy.\n\n268\n00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.451\nI might have, my email account,\nmy contacts, my calendar, my files, and\n\n269\n00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:02.630\nmy icon drive.\n\n270\n00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.580\nAll that stuff would synchronize down.\n\n271\n00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.890\nI don't need to go and\nmigrate from another machine at all.\n\n272\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.390\nIf my old machine was using iCloud and\n\n273\n00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.100\nmy new machine's using iCloud,\neverything syncs.\n\n274\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.880\n&gt;&gt; The convenience of Cloud services,\nright?\n\n275\n00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.240\nIt's the benefit of using them really.\n\n276\n00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThere's a little bit of risk.\n\n277\n00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.900\nSome people don't like their\ndata stored up in the Cloud but,\n\n278\n00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.058\nboy is that convenience.\n\n279\n00:12:21.058 --> 00:12:21.617\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n&gt;&gt; Worth it.\n\n280\n00:12:21.617 --> 00:12:22.837\nIt makes life so\n\n281\n00:12:22.837 --> 00:12:24.460\nmuch easier to move between machines.\n\n282\n00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.040\nI used to joke that every time I got\na new computer, it would take me a week\n\n283\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.360\nbefore I got everything set back\nthe way that I want it to be.\n\n284\n00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.980\nBut now I can get a new computer and\nwithin an hour.\n\n285\n00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.005\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All the settings have\n\n286\n00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:38.070\ncome back down and\nthen we're back in place.\n\n287\n00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.330\nAnd there are a few things that\ndon't transfer through iCloud,\n\n288\n00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.130\nlike your system preferences, so\nthere are stuff you still have to tweak.\n\n289\n00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.860\nBut all your user data can be\ndropped right back down in no time,\n\n290\n00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.600\nand you're back in business pretty fast.\n\n291\n00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.455\nAll right,\nI'm not gonna sign in to iCloud,\n\n292\n00:12:50.455 --> 00:12:51.400\nbecause that's just too convenient.\n\n293\n00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.810\nAnd we cover iCloud in\na dedicated episode later, so\n\n294\n00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.010\nyou'll get a chance to see that, but I'll\nleave it here and just skip past that.\n\n295\n00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.375\nAnd now I sign up for the Apple terms and\nconditions, which I swear I've read.\n\n296\n00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:06.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] At some point.\n\n297\n00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.322\n&gt;&gt; For the price of one soul, you can.\n\n298\n00:13:08.322 --> 00:13:09.920\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\n\n299\n00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.100\nhere's the one user account.\n\n300\n00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.800\nNow it's gonna offer to\ncreate one user account.\n\n301\n00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.370\nAnd this user account is going\nto be an administrator, right?\n\n302\n00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.620\nSo this is somebody who's gonna\nhave full access to the system.\n\n303\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.130\nNormally it would be us,\nif this computer is intended for us.\n\n304\n00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.900\nBut if you're a business environment.\n\n305\n00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.810\nThis might be an administrative account\nthat your helpdesk is able used to\n\n306\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.360\nremotely manage the system.\n\n307\n00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.550\nIn another episode we'll cover\na product called Apple Remote Desktop.\n\n308\n00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.742\nAn ARD can link into your Macs to be\nable to control their software and\n\n309\n00:13:33.742 --> 00:13:37.440\nupdate them and reboot them and\ndo all sorts of really amazing stuff.\n\n310\n00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.570\nBut you have to have,\nan administrative account it uses.\n\n311\n00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.890\nSo this is a good spot to create that.\n\n312\n00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.850\nSo, I'm gonna create one called Help Desk.\n\n313\n00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.700\nAnd I'll just call it Help Desk, and\ngive it a super-secure password.\n\n314\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.822\nAnd I won't specify a hint,\nand we'll move past on that.\n\n315\n00:13:51.822 --> 00:13:54.520\n&gt;&gt; Will it balk at you for\nhaving a weak password?\n\n316\n00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.750\nI know you used a weak password, no hints.\n\n317\n00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.140\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nI just used a dictionary word right there,\n\n318\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.690\nso, no, it doesn't gripe at you for\ncreating a weak password.\n\n319\n00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.020\nAnd that is a problem, right?\n\n320\n00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.410\nAnd we need to make sure that if I'm using\nthis, let's say that I create the help\n\n321\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:11.480\ndesk account, on 1,000 machines and\nI use the same weak password on every one.\n\n322\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.990\nIf somebody figures it out on one machine,\nnow they know it on all 1,000.\n\n323\n00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.950\nSo in a corporate environment when\nyou create an account like that?\n\n324\n00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.490\nYou're normally gonna use\na randomly generated password.\n\n325\n00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.470\nSo, if you have 1,000 computers,\nit's 1,000 different passwords.\n\n326\n00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.200\nAnd that sounds like\na nightmare to manage.\n\n327\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.050\nBut it isn't when you're using Service\nManagement Accounts and you're using\n\n328\n00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:32.540\nOpen Directory and things in that nature,\nit really makes life easier to manage.\n\n329\n00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.940\nBut it keeps things a little more secure.\n\n330\n00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.210\nIf one machine gets compromised, it's\nnot all your machines are compromised.\n\n331\n00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.140\nAll right, I'm going to go and\npick my timezone.\n\n332\n00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.550\nYou just pick a city that's nearby you.\n\n333\n00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.490\nI'm not actually in Jacksonville,\nbut that's.\n\n334\n00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.190\n&gt;&gt; Close enough?\n\n335\n00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.336\n&gt;&gt; Maybe less than 100 miles away.\n\n336\n00:14:46.336 --> 00:14:47.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that's close enough to be in\n\n337\n00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.520\nthe right time zone,\n\n338\n00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.592\nand that's really all this is about\nis being in the right time zone.\n\n339\n00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.360\nAs we move forward, Diagnostics &amp; Usage.\n\n340\n00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.510\nDo you want to report\ninformation back to Apple so\n\n341\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.750\nthey can help improve their products?\n\n342\n00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.270\nMaybe you want to, maybe you don't.\n\n343\n00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.210\nIt's up to you.\n\n344\n00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.850\nIf you don't have internet access, then\nyou might as well turn these off because\n\n345\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.950\nit's not gonna work anyway and you're\njust wasting resources on the computer.\n\n346\n00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.670\nI'll go and leave mine on.\n\n347\n00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.940\nAnd it's going to finish the setup,\nall right?\n\n348\n00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.480\nIt's got all the information\nit needs from me, and so\n\n349\n00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.560\nnow it's creating that user\naccount in the background.\n\n350\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.060\nAnd when I log in, it's gonna create my\nhome directory and allow me to log in and\n\n351\n00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.800\nstart to use the system.\n\n352\n00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.860\nNow technically when you complete\nthe setup Wizard, there we go.\n\n353\n00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.110\nTechnically when you complete the setup\nWizard, you're now ready to use your Mac.\n\n354\n00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.650\nYou can get it to do\nwhatever you need to do.\n\n355\n00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.430\nBut the reality is,\n\n356\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.930\na Mac right out of the box,\nis missing certain functionality, right?\n\n357\n00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.706\nThere's stuff that we need to be able\nto do business, to do our work and\n\n358\n00:15:41.706 --> 00:15:44.150\nwe're gonna have to get in and\nstart get these things setup.\n\n359\n00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.346\nAnd it can be a lot of work but\n\n360\n00:15:45.346 --> 00:15:48.690\nthis is where the other steps that Apple\nwas talking about are gonna come in.\n\n361\n00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.077\nThings like migrating our settings\nin from another computer, and\n\n362\n00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:53.414\nbringing those in place.\n\n363\n00:15:53.414 --> 00:15:57.917\nSo for example, if I already have\na Windows machine that's set up with\n\n364\n00:15:57.917 --> 00:16:01.669\neverything that I need, and\nI'm moving over to this Mac.\n\n365\n00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:04.359\nIt would be nice if I could just\nbring those settings over, and\n\n366\n00:16:04.359 --> 00:16:06.400\nwe can use the Migration Assistant\nto do that.\n\n367\n00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.500\nSo that's what we're gonna take a look at,\nnext.\n\n368\n00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.400\n&gt;&gt; So Don, when it comes to migrating\nthe data from our old Windows PC,\n\n369\n00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.470\nare we just gonna, I mean, they're two\ndifferent operating systems, so are we\n\n370\n00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.880\ngonna have to copy the files over to some\nremovable media, like a flash drive or\n\n371\n00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.930\nsomething, and then put that into\nour new Mac or how's this work?\n\n372\n00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:22.780\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can.\n\n373\n00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.350\nYou can do it that way.\n\n374\n00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.090\nThat's called a manual migration, right?\n\n375\n00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.588\nWhere you know your data, you copy it to\na USB key or something in that nature and\n\n376\n00:16:28.588 --> 00:16:31.650\nyou bring it over to the new system and\ncopy it back, right?\n\n377\n00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.050\nManual migrations are fine, but\n\n378\n00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.350\nthey're time consuming and they assume\nthat you know where your data is.\n\n379\n00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.780\nWell, you, as an ITProTV viewer,\nmore than likely know where your data is.\n\n380\n00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.810\nBut think about the end users you support.\n\n381\n00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.627\nThey likely don't know\nwhere their data is.\n\n382\n00:16:43.627 --> 00:16:46.370\n[LAUGH] Half the time,\nthey don't know where the power button is.\n\n383\n00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.380\nSo we wanna make things\nas easy as possible, and\n\n384\n00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.250\nthat's exactly what Apple has done,\nis they have created a migration wizard.\n\n385\n00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.830\nAnd the migration wizard works on Mac and\nWindows.\n\n386\n00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.480\nSo you use the same wizard, whether you're\ngoing Mac to Mac or Windows to Mac.\n\n387\n00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.010\nAnd it's a little software\nprogram that runs, and\n\n388\n00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.170\nit collects all your data for you.\n\n389\n00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.560\nAnd it transfers it over the network,\nand deposits it on the other machine.\n\n390\n00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.530\nSo you don't even need a USB\nkey to do this type of thing.\n\n391\n00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.330\nIt's just right over the network, and\nwho doesn't have a wireless network,\n\n392\n00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.710\nor a physical network.\n\n393\n00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.370\nIf you don't, right,\nyou can take a crossover cable,\n\n394\n00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:22.460\njust a regular, well, not a regular\nnetwork cable, but a copper network cable\n\n395\n00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:27.140\nthat's configured as a crossover, and\nrun it back to back between two machines.\n\n396\n00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.030\nOr you could create an ad hoc\nwireless network on your new laptop.\n\n397\n00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.330\nYour old laptop can connect, or your old\ndesktop can connect via the wireless.\n\n398\n00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.220\nAnd now you can transfer\nthat data really easy.\n\n399\n00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.450\nAnd it's all done through\nthe Migration Assistant.\n\n400\n00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.200\nNow, the Migration Assistant\nhas two pieces.\n\n401\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.940\nThere's the sender and\nthe receiver, right?\n\n402\n00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.230\nThe receiver is the new machine,\nthe machine that's receiving the data.\n\n403\n00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.870\nThis is who we're migrating to,\nthe new computer.\n\n404\n00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.940\nAnd the sender is the old machine,\nthe old machine where your data is.\n\n405\n00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.760\nIt needs to send its data\nover to the receiver.\n\n406\n00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.195\nSo we actually have to run\nthis software on both sides.\n\n407\n00:17:56.195 --> 00:17:59.000\nWell on your new Mac it's\ngot the software built-in.\n\n408\n00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.430\nIt already offered to run it, right?\n\n409\n00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.790\nSo during the initial install,\nit offered to run the migration.\n\n410\n00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.800\nI just didn't do it.\n\n411\n00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.890\nSo now what I can do is if I browse here.\n\n412\n00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.290\nSo I'm on my new Mac, right?\n\n413\n00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.860\nThis is brand new and shiny.\n\n414\n00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.930\nI'll go in to my Mac hard drive and\ninto applications.\n\n415\n00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.930\nAnd inside of applications,\nI'm gonna find the utilities folder.\n\n416\n00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.270\nAnd inside of utilities,\nwe can look in here and\n\n417\n00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:24.796\nfind the Migration Assistant and\nit is staring right at me.\n\n418\n00:18:24.796 --> 00:18:25.394\n[LAUGH] I'm looking.\n\n419\n00:18:25.394 --> 00:18:26.580\n&gt;&gt; With actual faces.\n\n420\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.951\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, alphabet.\n\n421\n00:18:27.951 --> 00:18:31.620\nSo, when I look at this saying\nsee how it's Mac to Mac, right?\n\n422\n00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.760\nIt's got the, well,\nI'm gonna say old icon and\n\n423\n00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.995\nnew icon cuz on the really old\nMacs it was gray like that.\n\n424\n00:18:37.995 --> 00:18:40.210\nBut basically it's just migrating\nMac to Mac is what it shows,\n\n425\n00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:44.860\nbut if I run it, it's not just Mac to Mac,\nit's Windows to Mac as well.\n\n426\n00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.930\nSo when I run it it's gonna\nask me a few questions, right?\n\n427\n00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.610\nSo first, I need to be an administrator\nbecause it's going to be\n\n428\n00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:54.480\nbringing administrative settings in and\nit's also going to be logging me out\n\n429\n00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.270\nhere in a minute cuz you need to be\nlogged out while it transfers data, so\n\n430\n00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.620\nyou'll see it do that too.\n\n431\n00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.230\nBut let me provide my\nadministrative credentials.\n\n432\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.330\nAnd then, see how it's logging me out?\n\n433\n00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.670\nAnd then it's gonna take me to what is\n\n434\n00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.930\nbasically the same screen we\nsaw during the install, right?\n\n435\n00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.590\nSo, like I said, we can always go\nback to these steps after the fact.\n\n436\n00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.480\nWe don't have to do them in Apple's order.\n\n437\n00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.440\nAnd now it's asking me what I want to do.\n\n438\n00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.620\nSo do I want to migrate from a Mac,\nfrom a Windows machine, or\n\n439\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.500\ntransfer to another Mac?\n\n440\n00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.250\nAll right, so the first two\nare assuming that I'm the receiver.\n\n441\n00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.720\nI'm the new computer receiving data.\n\n442\n00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.190\nTo another Mac,\nthat assumes that I'm sender, all right?\n\n443\n00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:37.370\nSo if I'm going Mac to Mac, I run this\nsame migration Wizard on both Macs.\n\n444\n00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.900\nAnd on this one, I would choose\nFrom a Mac, and on the old Mac,\n\n445\n00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.330\nI would choose To a Mac, and then\nthey'll find each other on the network.\n\n446\n00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.200\nNow, I'm gonna migrate From a Windows PC,\nso I'm gonna choose that.\n\n447\n00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:51.980\nNow, it's gonna tell me, if I do this,\nthat I'm running the Migration Wizard,\n\n448\n00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:52.880\nright here.\n\n449\n00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.220\nNow I need to go and run the Migration\nWizard on my Windows machine.\n\n450\n00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.290\nWell, guess what?\n\n451\n00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.370\nMicrosoft doesn't package\nApple's Migration Wizard with Windows.\n\n452\n00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:01.790\nCan you believe that?\n\n453\n00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.180\nThey don't want you to\nmove over to Mac OS.\n\n454\n00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.080\nAnd it's fine that they don't,\n\n455\n00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:12.090\nbecause Apple is constantly updating\nthe Migration Wizard to add new settings,\n\n456\n00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.800\nto fix problems,\nto support new OSs, right?\n\n457\n00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.607\nSo anytime a new version\nof Windows comes out,\n\n458\n00:20:16.607 --> 00:20:19.120\nthe Migration Wizard has to be\nupdated to reflect that, right?\n\n459\n00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.520\nTo be able to support moving it over.\n\n460\n00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.840\nSo it's telling me here what I should\ndo is go to my Windows machine and\n\n461\n00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.930\nbecause it doesn't have\nthe Migration Wizard built-in,\n\n462\n00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:31.240\nI need to go to\nwww.apple.com/migrate-to-mac.\n\n463\n00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.730\nThat's the website I need to go to, right.\n\n464\n00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:38.350\nSo if I go to my Windows machine which\nI've got parked back here somewhere.\n\n465\n00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:44.848\nI can go to www.apple.com/migrate-to-mac.\n\n466\n00:20:44.848 --> 00:20:46.999\nAnd when I go to that website,\n\n467\n00:20:46.999 --> 00:20:51.929\nwhich it has apparently very\nconveniently helped me by Bing-ing.\n\n468\n00:20:51.929 --> 00:20:54.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This might be one of the reasons\n\n469\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.350\nwhy you're moving to a Mac.\n\n470\n00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But it'll take you to this page, right?\n\n471\n00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.560\nWhich is download\nthe Windows Migration Assistant.\n\n472\n00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:05.220\nAt the moment this episode is being\nfilmed, the current version is 2.0.5.0.\n\n473\n00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.500\nYou might see a newer\nversion that's out there.\n\n474\n00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.020\nMake sure it's at least 2.0.5.0 or newer.\n\n475\n00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.990\nIf you look,\nthere's a link right here that says, Click\n\n476\n00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:20.700\nthis link to download Windows Migration\nAssistant 1.0.5.7 which was used for\n\n477\n00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.658\ntransferring Windows XP Service Pack\nthree and later to a Mac running OS X,\n\n478\n00:21:25.658 --> 00:21:29.580\n10.7 through 10.11.\n\n479\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.320\nWhat are we running?\n\n480\n00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.930\nMacOS Sierra is 10.12, so with Sierra\nthere is an all new Migration Assistant.\n\n481\n00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.770\nSo if you've got a Migration Assistant\nlaying around from some previous\n\n482\n00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.750\nmigration you've done, don't use it.\n\n483\n00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.880\nIt's free just go to Apple's website and\ndownload the newest one and\n\n484\n00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.850\nyou'll be taken care of, right?\n\n485\n00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:50.180\nSo do be aware of that, or if you're\nstill running El Capitan, or Yosemite, or\n\n486\n00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.456\nMavericks, or whatever in your\nenvironment for whatever reason,\n\n487\n00:21:52.456 --> 00:21:57.670\ndon't use the 2.0.5 one,\nbecause that one's designed for Sierra.\n\n488\n00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.530\nYou'll need to use this link to get\nthe old Migration Assistant because you're\n\n489\n00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.900\nstill running the older version of MacOS,\nright?\n\n490\n00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:07.770\nAnd it's more about the new machine,\nthe destination, than it is the sender.\n\n491\n00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.360\nThe sender might be an old\nversion of MacOS and that's fine.\n\n492\n00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:15.030\nThe receiver needs to be the one that\nmatches up with this version here.\n\n493\n00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.500\nSo this is the Sierra version.\n\n494\n00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.250\nSo you're gonna download that and\ninstall it on your Windows machine.\n\n495\n00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.380\nAnd before the show I went ahead and\ndownloaded it, and\n\n496\n00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:26.080\nwhen you run it,\nyou get the Migration Assistant Installer.\n\n497\n00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.750\nAll right, and\nit's just a real quick install,\n\n498\n00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:33.110\nyou basically hit next five times if I\nremember right, and it's gonna install.\n\n499\n00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.690\nIt'll ask for administrative\nprivileges at some some point, so\n\n500\n00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.480\nI'll have to give it that and\nthen it'll finish, right?\n\n501\n00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.160\nNow when it's done,\nthat wasn't the Migration Assistant,\n\n502\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.680\nthat was just installing\nthe Migration Assistant.\n\n503\n00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.440\nSo I'll say yes to let it finish.\n\n504\n00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.840\nAnd when it's done, we need to\nactually run the migration assistant.\n\n505\n00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.184\nWhat is going on here?\n\n506\n00:22:52.184 --> 00:22:54.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It put a couple of drivers in and\n\n507\n00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.890\na few other things so apparently it's\njust gonna prompt me like crazy.\n\n508\n00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.470\nBut when it's done, there we go.\n\n509\n00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:02.200\nThis is the actual Migration Assistant,\nand if it didn't launch,\n\n510\n00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.910\nit does create an icon on your desktop.\n\n511\n00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.310\nAnd notice how it's that same\nicon we saw on the Mac, right?\n\n512\n00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.315\nSo it helps us try to find it.\n\n513\n00:23:09.315 --> 00:23:15.010\nNow, when we run through this wizard, it's\ngonna ask us what we want to migrate over.\n\n514\n00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.830\nAnd normally we think of a computer as\nsomething that only one person uses.\n\n515\n00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.860\nBut you might actually have several\npeople that share this computer,\n\n516\n00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.130\nand the Migration Assistant can\nmigrate all of those users over.\n\n517\n00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.400\nSo if I have five accounts for\nlike me and my family members, or\n\n518\n00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.160\na shared computer at work, it'll migrate\nall of them over assuming there isn't\n\n519\n00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.890\nalready an account with the same name and\nthey might butt heads on that one.\n\n520\n00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:38.330\n&gt;&gt; So Don, do we have to create\nthose accounts on our Mac first, and\n\n521\n00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.000\nthen we can migrate those users?\n\n522\n00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.245\nOr does it see that there are multiple\naccounts on the Windows machine,\n\n523\n00:23:43.245 --> 00:23:46.490\nand the Migration Wizard says,\nI need to create these accounts and\n\n524\n00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.130\nput these files in those accounts?\n\n525\n00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:48.998\n&gt;&gt; It'll actually create them for you.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n526\n00:23:48.998 --> 00:23:51.236\n&gt;&gt; It can't migrate the password.\n\n527\n00:23:51.236 --> 00:23:52.504\nIt doesn't know what your password is, but\n\n528\n00:23:52.504 --> 00:23:54.881\nit'll create the account, and then you\njust have to go in and reset the password.\n\n529\n00:23:54.881 --> 00:23:59.132\nYeah, it'll make each one that's\nmissing and put those in place.\n\n530\n00:23:59.132 --> 00:24:02.586\nSo as I continue forward,\nit's going to ask me about the data that I\n\n531\n00:24:02.586 --> 00:24:05.918\nwant to move and it may seem like\nit moves slow at some points, but\n\n532\n00:24:05.918 --> 00:24:07.980\nthat's just it harvesting data.\n\n533\n00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.525\nIt's basically scanning the hard drive.\n\n534\n00:24:09.525 --> 00:24:11.080\nIt's looking for your information and\n\n535\n00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.840\nif this is your old computer,\nthe odds are it's slow, right?\n\n536\n00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.320\nThat's why we get new computers.\n\n537\n00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.360\nSo it's going to take\na moment as it scans through.\n\n538\n00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.420\nNow here, it's actually not scanning yet.\n\n539\n00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.980\nIt's telling me, waiting for\nyour Mac to connect.\n\n540\n00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.096\nAt this point, the migration assistant is\nusing the Bonjour protocol on Windows or\n\n541\n00:24:26.096 --> 00:24:28.922\non Mac to scan the network and\nlook for the receiver.\n\n542\n00:24:28.922 --> 00:24:31.530\nThis is going to be the sender,\nso it's looking for the receiver.\n\n543\n00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:35.960\nIf I jump back over to my Mac,\nmy Mac was watching and there it is.\n\n544\n00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.180\nIt just found the Windows machine.\n\n545\n00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.870\nNow, I still pick it here on the screen,\n\n546\n00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.550\nbecause there might be more\nthan one machine running.\n\n547\n00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.970\nAnd I don't want to pick\nthe wrong machine and\n\n548\n00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.070\nnow I transmitted all my\ndata to the wrong place.\n\n549\n00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:47.010\nThat would be bad.\n\n550\n00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.020\nSo I see it here.\n\n551\n00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:52.260\nThe Windows ones, it's like the quick\nlittle dig here on Microsoft.\n\n552\n00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.320\nThey show the old CRT with\nthe blue screen of death on it.\n\n553\n00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.120\nBut there's my machine that it identified.\n\n554\n00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.680\nAnd I'm gonna choose and hit Continue.\n\n555\n00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.920\nNow, we need to doubly make sure we're not\ntransferring our data to the wrong place,\n\n556\n00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.420\nso it gives me a code.\n\n557\n00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.492\nMy code, and these are one time codes, so\n\n558\n00:25:08.492 --> 00:25:11.821\nit doesn't bother me showing\nit on the screen, is 983485.\n\n559\n00:25:11.821 --> 00:25:15.670\nSo when I go over to the Mac, it's\nshowing me, hopefully, that same code.\n\n560\n00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.690\nIf it's a different code,\nI know I've connected to the wrong system.\n\n561\n00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:19.525\nDon't transfer your data.\n\n562\n00:25:19.525 --> 00:25:23.000\nYou can just choose Go Back and try again.\n\n563\n00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.010\nBut if it's the same code,\nwe can go ahead and hit Continue.\n\n564\n00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:27.380\nSo I'll hit Continue there.\n\n565\n00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.590\nBack over here,\nI don't have to hit Continue.\n\n566\n00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:30.990\nIt's just waiting for that confirmation.\n\n567\n00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.939\nAnd it's gonna get the confirmation and\nthere it is.\n\n568\n00:25:33.939 --> 00:25:38.290\nOn my old computer,\nit's just sitting here waiting.\n\n569\n00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:43.660\nOn the new computer is where I pick\nwhat it is I want to transfer.\n\n570\n00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.560\nAnd it's looking at the user account\nI was logged in as, a moment ago.\n\n571\n00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.910\nIt's gonna get Music,\nPictures, Movies, Desktop.\n\n572\n00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.100\nSo bringing stuff over, now what's some\nof the stuff that it's gonna bring?\n\n573\n00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.820\nWell, on my old computer I\nhad some documents, right?\n\n574\n00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.800\nSo if I go into my Documents folder here.\n\n575\n00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.010\nI can see I've got Don's Term Paper\nsitting there in My Documents folder.\n\n576\n00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:03.640\nOkay, good.\n\n577\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.080\nI want that brought over.\n\n578\n00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.740\nOr if I launch Internet Explorer and\nsuffer through that for\n\n579\n00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.420\na moment, there we go.\n\n580\n00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.810\nEventually, Internet Explorer\nwill come up, there.\n\n581\n00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.643\nI might have favorites that are saved.\n\n582\n00:26:15.643 --> 00:26:20.613\nAnd so if I take a look at my favorites,\nI've got CNN, Fox News, ITProTV, and Bing,\n\n583\n00:26:20.613 --> 00:26:22.240\nin case I wanna get to Bing.\n\n584\n00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.770\nWell, I might wanna bring\nthose over into Safari, right?\n\n585\n00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.120\nThese are all settings on my old machine\nthat I want to bring over sort to be\n\n586\n00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.890\nconfigured and ready to rock.\n\n587\n00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:34.140\nSo if I jump back over to my old machine,\nor\n\n588\n00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.110\nsorry to my new machine,\nit's easy to mix them up.\n\n589\n00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.820\nI can see its gonna get my documents and\nsomewhere in here,\n\n590\n00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.720\nI'll see where it gets my bookmarks,\nright there.\n\n591\n00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.440\nAnd I can even get other\nfiles on the C drive.\n\n592\n00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.670\nIt's trying to find my information.\n\n593\n00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.050\nAnything that I've added\nthat's different than what was\n\n594\n00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.950\nin a base install of Windows,\nto bring it over.\n\n595\n00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.870\nNow, it is possible it\ncould miss something, so\n\n596\n00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.570\nyou do need to understand your data and\nlook for it.\n\n597\n00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.660\nIt does a really good job, but\nsometimes users put documents\n\n598\n00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.410\nin weird spots where they're not supposed\nto be and that data can get lost.\n\n599\n00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.700\nSo we need to be careful with that, but\nit's done a pretty good job of finding my\n\n600\n00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.289\ninformation, so\nI'm going to go ahead and hit Continue.\n\n601\n00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.730\nAnd now it's actually\nstarting to transfer.\n\n602\n00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:17.950\nSo now it's actually moving data from\nthe old computer over to the new Mac and\n\n603\n00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:19.260\nit'll take a certain amount of time.\n\n604\n00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.040\nThe amount of time is gonna vary\nbased on how much data you have.\n\n605\n00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.370\nMine is going over the network.\n\n606\n00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:26.117\nAnd your network is only so fast, so it\ncan only move data at such a certain rate.\n\n607\n00:27:26.117 --> 00:27:28.850\nSo we just have to wait for it to do that.\n\n608\n00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:33.670\nIn the meantime on the old computer It's\njust waiting until it tells me it's done.\n\n609\n00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.746\nIt actually says that it is done.\n\n610\n00:27:34.746 --> 00:27:37.700\nIt has migrated successfully,\nso I can quit that.\n\n611\n00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.070\nAnd now my old computer is untouched.\n\n612\n00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.690\nIt's still there.\n\n613\n00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:42.503\nAll my data is there.\n\n614\n00:27:42.503 --> 00:27:44.640\nI can still use it like I used to, but\n\n615\n00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.000\na copy of the data is been\nsent over to the new machine.\n\n616\n00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.210\nAnd on the new machine,\nit shows that the migration is complete.\n\n617\n00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:55.640\nAnd now I can shut off my old machine and\njust use the new one.\n\n618\n00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.290\nI created a help desk account\nduring the install a moment ago.\n\n619\n00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:00.170\nNow I've got my new account.\n\n620\n00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:04.540\nAnd it even brought over the crazy\nlittle owl from the Windows install.\n\n621\n00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.470\nThat's not an icon that's\nincluded with MAC OS.\n\n622\n00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.625\nFor good reason, it's kind of creepy.\n\n623\n00:28:09.625 --> 00:28:10.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n624\n00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:12.860\nif I choose it, it's gonna tell\nme it doesn't have a password.\n\n625\n00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.520\nAnd I need to reset that password, because\nit didn't know what my password was.\n\n626\n00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.980\nSo I'll type in a new password.\n\n627\n00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.700\nThere we go, and we'll reset that.\n\n628\n00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.830\nAnd so now I'll actually have\na password set to the account.\n\n629\n00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:29.770\nIf I brought over five users, all five\nusers would have to reset that password.\n\n630\n00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:33.910\nAnd get that changed over to\nthe new entry, all right.\n\n631\n00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:35.280\nWhen that's done, it's gonna log me in.\n\n632\n00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.860\nAnd I should see that my information\n\n633\n00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:41.780\nhas been brought over to help me get this\nMac up and running that much faster.\n\n634\n00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.120\nNow the things that I'm going to look for\nare pretty minor.\n\n635\n00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.730\nSome documents in my documents folder,\nsome bookmarks in Safari.\n\n636\n00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:49.870\nBut you may have many, many other things.\n\n637\n00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.060\nThere are some things\nthat don't come over.\n\n638\n00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.620\nSo for example, sorry,\nI'm going to skip the iCloud sign-in.\n\n639\n00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.680\nFor example, my wallpaper, right?\n\n640\n00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.320\nWallpapers won't normally come over.\n\n641\n00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:03.370\nThere's a few reasons for that, but if\nyou're using a wallpaper that was included\n\n642\n00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:07.640\nwith Windows, well, your license for that\nties it to the Windows operating system so\n\n643\n00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.600\nApple doesn't bring it over and\nI still end up with the mountains.\n\n644\n00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.010\nIf you do a custom wallpaper,\nsometimes they do come over.\n\n645\n00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.640\nSometimes they don't.\n\n646\n00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.560\nIt's usually licensing\nthat's a problem there.\n\n647\n00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.850\nBut other things like my documents,\nthose should have come over just fine.\n\n648\n00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:23.490\nIf I fire up my finder and go into\nMy Documents, there's Don's Term Paper.\n\n649\n00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:25.200\nIt's sitting right there, ready to go.\n\n650\n00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.590\nAnd if I fire up Safari,\nnow remember, on a Windows machine,\n\n651\n00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.360\nwe don't even have Safari.\n\n652\n00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:35.000\nBut here on the Mac, if I fire up Safari,\nand I go into my bookmarks,\n\n653\n00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.160\nI've got a folder here in my bookmarks\ncalled Migrated from Internet Explorer.\n\n654\n00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.380\nAnd there's Bing, CNN,\nFox News, and IT Pro TV.\n\n655\n00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.050\nWe can click on those,\nbrowse right to them, and they're working.\n\n656\n00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:49.950\nSo now, I'm ready to go on\nthis new Mac in short order.\n\n657\n00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.620\nI can get up and going because all\nmy data's been migrated over, and\n\n658\n00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.320\nI turn off my old computer, but\nI don't throw it away just yet.\n\n659\n00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.630\nHold on to it for a day or two, right?\n\n660\n00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.608\nMake sure all your information is there,\n\n661\n00:29:59.608 --> 00:30:02.884\nbecause if there's anything missing\nyou can go to the old computer,\n\n662\n00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:05.727\nplug in a USB key, copy it over,\nbring it over really easy.\n\n663\n00:30:05.727 --> 00:30:09.791\nBut if you've thrown it away, or\nerased it or whatever, you can't do that.\n\n664\n00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:10.890\nSo wait a few days.\n\n665\n00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.530\nMake sure you got all your information,\nand\n\n666\n00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.240\nthen it's safe to get rid\nof that old computer.\n\n667\n00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.170\n&gt;&gt; Well it seems like the good people\nover at the Apple Corporation have done\n\n668\n00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:21.430\na very good job of trying to\nmake this a very quick and\n\n669\n00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:25.900\neven painless way to migrate from another\ncomputer to something that they have.\n\n670\n00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.250\nYou know,\ntheir new Mac OS is very nice and\n\n671\n00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.720\nDon, I see not many flaws\nin their logic here.\n\n672\n00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.910\nI mean, it was super easy.\n\n673\n00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.240\nIt wasn't very difficult at all.\n\n674\n00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.363\nI think just about anybody with any\nkind of human acumen would be able to-\n\n675\n00:30:39.363 --> 00:30:40.475\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n676\n00:30:40.475 --> 00:30:43.981\n&gt;&gt; Do this procedure, it's not very hard.\n\n677\n00:30:43.981 --> 00:30:47.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the only real challenge is\nit doesn't bring over applications.\n\n678\n00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:51.490\nSo maybe I had Microsoft Word\ninstalled on my Windows machine.\n\n679\n00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:54.940\nWell, it'll bring over my Word documents,\nbut it won't bring over Word,\n\n680\n00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.610\nbecause I need to install the Mac version\nof Microsoft Word to get that working.\n\n681\n00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:00.900\nSo you do still have the applications\nthat you gotta jump through.\n\n682\n00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.630\nIt's not a perfect transition.\n\n683\n00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:04.820\nBut it's a good start,\n\n684\n00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:08.190\nand it saves you a lot of time\nwith getting things moved over.\n\n685\n00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.500\nAfter that you throw on your applications\nand then you're ready to rock.\n\n686\n00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.620\n&gt;&gt; That's right,and then all the old\nfiles that had those great extensions,\n\n687\n00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.320\nthey should be able to operate after that.\n\n688\n00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.040\nSo once you get that application\ninstalled, it'll see those files and\n\n689\n00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.480\nbe able to run them very easily.\n\n690\n00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.975\nDon, I know we actually have quite\na bit more to go through, but\n\n691\n00:31:21.975 --> 00:31:24.335\nour clock has dwindled long ago.\n\n692\n00:31:24.335 --> 00:31:25.122\nThat time has expired.\n\n693\n00:31:25.122 --> 00:31:29.165\nSo we're gonna have to roll into\na Part Three, a Part Three, Part Two.\n\n694\n00:31:29.165 --> 00:31:29.845\nWhere am I at?\n\n695\n00:31:29.845 --> 00:31:31.125\nMy brain is all over the place today.\n\n696\n00:31:31.125 --> 00:31:32.505\n&gt;&gt; You're ready to go Part Three?\n\n697\n00:31:32.505 --> 00:31:33.125\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n698\n00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:34.969\nIt felt like two parts.\n\n699\n00:31:34.969 --> 00:31:37.063\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But thanks for joining us in this part.\n\n700\n00:31:37.063 --> 00:31:38.927\nLooking forward to see you in Part Two.\n\n701\n00:31:38.927 --> 00:31:40.882\nHopefully, you good folks\nwill join us as well.\n\n702\n00:31:40.882 --> 00:31:43.640\nBut as for\nthis we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n703\n00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.960\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n704\n00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.900\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n705\n00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.024\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n706\n00:31:51.024 --> 00:31:54.781\n[MUSIC]\n\n707\n00:31:54.781 --> 00:31:56.665\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:05.893\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.893 --> 00:00:08.445\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:12.102\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.102 --> 00:00:13.940\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.995\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:19.785\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, well,\n\n9\n00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.755\nwe're coming back with\nmore of the ACSP series.\n\n10\n00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:25.727\nAnd joining us in the studio,\nyet again continuing\n\n11\n00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:29.977\nlooking at additional configuration,\nour good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n12\n00:00:29.977 --> 00:00:31.227\nDon, glad to have you again, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:31.227 --> 00:00:32.057\nHow's it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:34.952\n&gt;&gt; Hey, ready to jump right back in and\nkeep configurating this thing.\n\n15\n00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.892\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Configurating, that's right.\n\n16\n00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:41.579\n&gt;&gt; So in the last episode we got a chance\nto see the initial configuration of\n\n17\n00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.057\na new Mac, or\na Mac we've recently formatted.\n\n18\n00:00:44.057 --> 00:00:47.290\nAnd we talked about migrating our\nsettings over from another computer.\n\n19\n00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.950\nAnd at some point in the episode,\nI threw out the flippant statement that\n\n20\n00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.120\nthere's really just one thing\nthat we can't migrate over, and\n\n21\n00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.290\nthose are our system preferences.\n\n22\n00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.900\nSo in this episode, I wanna talk\nabout those system preferences.\n\n23\n00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.310\nAnd what you'll find is that most of them\nare not really consequential to getting\n\n24\n00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.840\nstarted on your new system.\n\n25\n00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.960\nBut they are things that, at least from a\nquality of life perspective, we'll want to\n\n26\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.660\ntweak and customize to get the computer\nrunning the way that we're used to,\n\n27\n00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.450\nwhich is gonna make us more productive and\nbe able to get things done faster.\n\n28\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.680\nSo in this episode that's our goal, right?\n\n29\n00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.910\nWe're gonna tackle system preferences and\nsome of the key important ones,\n\n30\n00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.280\nespecially like on the networking side.\n\n31\n00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.680\nThose are really critical for\nus to get configured properly.\n\n32\n00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.420\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, since it's so\nimportant, Don, well, for\n\n33\n00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.400\nthe uninitiated out there,\nhow the heck do you even\n\n34\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.315\nget to your system-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n35\n00:01:31.315 --> 00:01:32.030\n&gt;&gt; Preferences, so\n\n36\n00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.230\nthat you can tweak them\nto the way you like?\n\n37\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nthis one's pretty easy because pretty much\n\n38\n00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.718\nfrom any screen inside of macOS, you'll\nalways have your Apple menu up top, right?\n\n39\n00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:43.490\nSo when I look at the desktop here,\n\n40\n00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.520\nup in my top corner, I've got this\nlittle apple, whoops, there we go.\n\n41\n00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.200\nThere's a little apple\nfloating right up here.\n\n42\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.380\nAnd if I click my apple, I'll see some\nvarious things mainly About This Mac and\n\n43\n00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.110\nthen System Preferences, right?\n\n44\n00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.496\nSo I can quickly and easily jump into my\nSystem Preferences right when I need it.\n\n45\n00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:01.430\nSo I'm gonna do that, just jump\nright into System Preferences, and\n\n46\n00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.220\nyou'll see a screen that looks like this.\n\n47\n00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.810\nNow we just completed a clean\ninstall of macOS, and so this\n\n48\n00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.360\nis the System Preference screen as you'll\nsee it on a new install of macOS Sierra.\n\n49\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.564\nIf you're looking your existing Mac,\nthings might look different, right?\n\n50\n00:02:17.564 --> 00:02:20.758\nOver time, as you add more software,\nthings start to customize and change.\n\n51\n00:02:20.758 --> 00:02:23.622\nYou might add additional hardware and\nthings start to change.\n\n52\n00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:26.000\nThere's various thing that may appear or\nmay not appear.\n\n53\n00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.790\nFor example,\nI see the CDs &amp; DVDs system preference.\n\n54\n00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.032\nWhat if you don't have a CD or DVD drive?\n\n55\n00:02:33.032 --> 00:02:34.508\nThen that doesn't show up, and is missing.\n\n56\n00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:36.580\nSo it is little bit dynamic, right?\n\n57\n00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.248\nIt's also dynamic in screen size, right?\n\n58\n00:02:38.248 --> 00:02:42.060\nSo if I drag it, make it wider or\nwhatever, it'll kind of align differently.\n\n59\n00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.210\nBut as far as the icons themselves,\n\n60\n00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.150\nthey change based on the hardware\nthat you have, right?\n\n61\n00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.410\nSo your screen might look a little bit\ndifferent than mine, but for the most\n\n62\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.854\npart, these are the icons that we expect\nto see inside of System Preferences.\n\n63\n00:02:53.854 --> 00:02:57.070\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, I'm also noticing\nthat they seem to be broken up.\n\n64\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.049\nI don't see one continuous block of icons.\n\n65\n00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.220\nThey seem to be chunked together.\n\n66\n00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.470\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, they're not alphabetized.\n\n67\n00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.754\nFirst off,\nthat always kind off annoyed me.\n\n68\n00:03:05.754 --> 00:03:07.704\n&gt;&gt; That's fun.\n&gt;&gt; Here's General and there's Dock, so\n\n69\n00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:09.460\nthey're not really alphabetized.\n\n70\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.330\nAnd they're arranged in\nthese odd categories and\n\n71\n00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.790\nthe categories are not labeled.\n\n72\n00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.000\nSo what's the real meaning here?\n\n73\n00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.220\nWell, first off, let me just clarify\nbecause this all sounds bad, right?\n\n74\n00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.982\nAlphabetize it.\n\n75\n00:03:18.982 --> 00:03:20.365\n&gt;&gt; This is horrible.\n&gt;&gt; Weird categories,\n\n76\n00:03:20.365 --> 00:03:22.264\nthe main reason is they said look,\n\n77\n00:03:22.264 --> 00:03:25.825\nusers shouldn't have to\nmemorize where settings are.\n\n78\n00:03:25.825 --> 00:03:28.310\nSo if I wanna do something like\nset my screen saver, well,\n\n79\n00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.895\nI've got it right here, Desktop &amp; Screen\nSaver, if I know to look for it, right?\n\n80\n00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:34.755\nBut if you don't remember where\na setting is, you can just go\n\n81\n00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:39.495\nright up to your search box and you can\ntype what it is you're looking to do.\n\n82\n00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:41.685\nSo when I start to type screen,\n\n83\n00:03:41.685 --> 00:03:45.900\nsee how some of the icons have\na little glow around them, right?\n\n84\n00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.580\nThose are ones that have\nsomething to do with screen.\n\n85\n00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.800\nNow what does Keyboard\nhave to do with screen?\n\n86\n00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.150\nWell, there's a screen reader\nfunctionality that has a shortcut that's\n\n87\n00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.070\ntied to the keyboards.\n\n88\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.730\nYou have a keyboard shortcut\nto turn on the screen reader.\n\n89\n00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.780\nI wouldn't necessarily know that\nif I wasn't looking for it.\n\n90\n00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.890\nBut if I continue typing here, and\n\n91\n00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.350\ntype in screen saver, see how it\nstarts getting smaller and smaller?\n\n92\n00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.090\nAnd finally, I got a direct hit.\n\n93\n00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.091\nWhen you get a direct hit,\nit's not just a little glow any more\n\n94\n00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:15.990\nlike under Security &amp; Privacy where\nthere's a screensaver timeout setting.\n\n95\n00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.570\nIt says require a password\nafter the screensaver turns on.\n\n96\n00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.630\nHere, I can actually set the screensaver,\nso it's a nice well-defined circle.\n\n97\n00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.350\nThis is probably the one I want.\n\n98\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.920\nSo because of that search functionality,\n\n99\n00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.430\nyou don't really care what category\nit's in, what order they're in.\n\n100\n00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.460\nYou can quickly and\neasily find what you want.\n\n101\n00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.670\nBut just so you know, there is some\nmeaning to the madness, all right?\n\n102\n00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.770\nEach of these little divisions\nhere represents a category, and\n\n103\n00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.420\nthe first category is\nwhat's called Personal.\n\n104\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.300\nThese are personal settings that\napply just to your user account.\n\n105\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.890\nIf there's five different users on\nthe computer, when they log in,\n\n106\n00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.280\nthey each maintain their\nown personal settings.\n\n107\n00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.130\nNow there's a few exceptions to that rule.\n\n108\n00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.010\nFor example, when I go to Security and\nPrivacy, inside of Security and\n\n109\n00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.292\nPrivacy we have FileVault and FileVault\nlets us encrypt the whole hard drive.\n\n110\n00:05:06.292 --> 00:05:08.210\nWell, that's gonna encrypt it for\neverybody,\n\n111\n00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.000\nright, because it's the whole hard drive.\n\n112\n00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.790\nSo that one actually\ndoes apply to everybody.\n\n113\n00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.100\nBut many of the other settings that\nare in here really just apply to you.\n\n114\n00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.820\nSo for example, if I go under General,\n\n115\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.920\nyou'll see things like, what's my general\nappearance for buttons and windows?\n\n116\n00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.610\nSee all these buttons,\nthese little drop down buttons are blue.\n\n117\n00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.030\nRight, that's part of\nthe default theme in the system.\n\n118\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.950\nI could change it to graphite and\nnow they'll turn gray.\n\n119\n00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.290\nRight, so\nif I hate blue I can switch to gray.\n\n120\n00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.710\nApple gives you the ability to hate color.\n\n121\n00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.902\n[LAUGH] So you can choose that.\n\n122\n00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:38.250\nPeople have preferences, I guess.\n\n123\n00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.080\nThey don't give you a whole lot of\noptions, right, blue and graphite.\n\n124\n00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.580\nYou can choose to Use a dark menu bar and\nDock.\n\n125\n00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.990\nAnd sometimes that works out really well.\n\n126\n00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.619\nSee this menu bar up here how it's white,\nor light gray, silver?\n\n127\n00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:48.847\n&gt;&gt; It's like a light gray.\n\n128\n00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:49.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know what it is.\n\n129\n00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.510\nAnd then down here,\nsame thing in the Dock.\n\n130\n00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.320\nI can come up here and choose to use\na dark one, and it becomes dark.\n\n131\n00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.082\nIt looks way more stylish, right?\n\n132\n00:05:56.082 --> 00:05:58.690\n&gt;&gt; That's great for low lights,\nif you're doing a low light area.\n\n133\n00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:59.380\n&gt;&gt; That's a good point.\n\n134\n00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.860\n&gt;&gt; I really like that in\na low light situation.\n\n135\n00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.070\n&gt;&gt; Or if you just have a wallpaper\nwhere it looks better,\n\n136\n00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.390\ncuz it's aesthetics, right?\n\n137\n00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.050\nBut we can kinda tweak that, so that's\nanother option that we can customize.\n\n138\n00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.570\nYou can Automatically hide and\nshow the menu bar.\n\n139\n00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.590\nThe menu bar up top,\nsee how it's always up there, right?\n\n140\n00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.940\nIf I choose to automatically hide it,\nit disappears.\n\n141\n00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.630\nAnd if I move my mouse\nup there it'll pop up.\n\n142\n00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.412\nNow I'm in a virtual machine, so\n\n143\n00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:22.674\nmy virtual machine menu will\npop up also if I'm not careful.\n\n144\n00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:23.660\nSo you may not want that.\n\n145\n00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.950\nLike for me, I don't want that\ncuz it messes up my functionally.\n\n146\n00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.170\nThere went my virtual machine one,\nbut I'll turn that back off so\n\n147\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.630\nthe menu bar's always there.\n\n148\n00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.640\nIf I change these options,\nthey're being changed just for me.\n\n149\n00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.300\nThey're personal settings.\n\n150\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.010\nIf I log out and Daniel logs into my\nlaptop, he'll have his own settings.\n\n151\n00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.700\nSo they're tied to the user account.\n\n152\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.670\nThat's why they call\nthis section Personal.\n\n153\n00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.850\nAnd so for most of your end users,\nwhen they customize a new Mac,\n\n154\n00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.850\nthis is where they'll spend their time,\nright up here.\n\n155\n00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.090\nYou don't have to be an administrator\nto do most of this stuff.\n\n156\n00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.240\nThey're just simple tweaks to the user\ninterface that customize what you've got.\n\n157\n00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.650\nDesktop &amp; Screen Saver.\n\n158\n00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.970\nSo what wallpaper do I want?\n\n159\n00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.820\nOr do I want a wallpaper at all, right?\n\n160\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.680\nI can walk you through some\nof the settings that I do.\n\n161\n00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.700\nI hate wallpapers, right,\nbecause I remote into computers a lot and\n\n162\n00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.290\nwallpapers slow down your connection.\n\n163\n00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.330\nSo I almost always\nswitch to a solid color.\n\n164\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.830\nSolid colors render really easily,\nand so I can choose that.\n\n165\n00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.490\nNow for those of you that use mac OS 7.6-\n&gt;&gt; This kinda looks familiar.\n\n166\n00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.355\n&gt;&gt; You're used to the blue background,\nright?\n\n167\n00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:21.000\nSo that's usually what I end up picking.\n\n168\n00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.130\nBut you can go with different colors.\n\n169\n00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.453\nWhat is that, cyan or something?\n\n170\n00:07:25.453 --> 00:07:27.121\nIf you know your colors,\nyou can customize it however you want.\n\n171\n00:07:27.121 --> 00:07:29.071\n&gt;&gt; I think cyan's like a red, isn't it?\n\n172\n00:07:29.071 --> 00:07:29.614\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea.\n\n173\n00:07:29.614 --> 00:07:30.672\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n174\n00:07:30.672 --> 00:07:32.450\nyou can pick your own custom colors, and\n\n175\n00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.660\nyou can even set where they rotate it and\nall that.\n\n176\n00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.150\nBut these are our customizations\nthat we can make.\n\n177\n00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.338\nAnd again, it's just tied to me.\n\n178\n00:07:38.338 --> 00:07:41.300\nIf somebody else also logs in,\nthey'll have the mountain background and\n\n179\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.810\nthey can then change it\nto whatever they want.\n\n180\n00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.930\nThe Dock can be customized,\nyou can make the Dock bigger or smaller.\n\n181\n00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.870\nYou can turn on\nthe Magnification function.\n\n182\n00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.420\nThat was one that I actually kinda missed.\n\n183\n00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.481\nOn the old Dock when you'd\nmove your mouse over,\n\n184\n00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:54.406\nwhatever you were\ndirectly over got bigger.\n\n185\n00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:56.917\nWell, that's off by default,\nand we can turn it on.\n\n186\n00:07:56.917 --> 00:08:00.072\nAnd now as I move,\nit does the old magnification effect,\n\n187\n00:08:00.072 --> 00:08:02.789\nwhich I know is kind of gimmicky,\nbut I liked it.\n\n188\n00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:03.741\n&gt;&gt; It worked for you.\n\n189\n00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:05.415\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, you get used to it.\n\n190\n00:08:05.415 --> 00:08:07.917\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and If you take it away,\n\n191\n00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:11.141\nit doesn't like stop me\nfrom being able to work.\n\n192\n00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:13.850\nBut it does hurt your\nproductivity a little bit.\n\n193\n00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.910\nIf we can get things set back\nthat way that we had them,\n\n194\n00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.550\nnow we can move through them better.\n\n195\n00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.070\nUnfortunately, these settings don't\ncome over with the migration assistance.\n\n196\n00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.146\nSo if we really want to customize stuff,\n\n197\n00:08:22.146 --> 00:08:24.536\nwe need to document what\nour preferences are.\n\n198\n00:08:24.536 --> 00:08:27.687\nWrite them down and say, I like to\nhave this menu bar set up this way.\n\n199\n00:08:27.687 --> 00:08:29.766\nAnd that way you can come in and\nrecreate those.\n\n200\n00:08:29.766 --> 00:08:34.797\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthe familiarity kinda breeds efficiency.\n\n201\n00:08:34.797 --> 00:08:36.493\nI know exactly where I have to go.\n\n202\n00:08:36.493 --> 00:08:37.660\nI know what it's supposed to look like.\n\n203\n00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.642\nAnd anything that's opposite to that or\n\n204\n00:08:39.642 --> 00:08:42.097\ndifferent from that's\ngonna kinda throw me off.\n\n205\n00:08:42.097 --> 00:08:45.217\n&gt;&gt; Now if you're trying to get your system\nto run a little faster you can disable\n\n206\n00:08:45.217 --> 00:08:46.260\na lot of screen effects.\n\n207\n00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.180\nAnd you'll see options in here.\n\n208\n00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.990\nLike I can turn that magnification off.\n\n209\n00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.810\nMinimize windows using the genie effect.\n\n210\n00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.900\nWhat is it talking about there?\n\n211\n00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.850\nWell, if I launch Safari right, so here's\nSafari, when I hit the minimize button,\n\n212\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.600\nwatch how it looks like a genie\ngoing back into the bottle, right.\n\n213\n00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.870\nThat little screen effect, that\nactually takes resources on the system.\n\n214\n00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.684\nNot a lot and if you've got a great\nsystem, you don't care about that.\n\n215\n00:09:07.684 --> 00:09:11.049\nBut if you want that to run a little\nfaster, you could come in here and\n\n216\n00:09:11.049 --> 00:09:12.536\nsay just do the scale effect.\n\n217\n00:09:12.536 --> 00:09:16.458\nAnd with the scale effect, instead of\nshrinking like the genie in a bottle,\n\n218\n00:09:16.458 --> 00:09:17.757\nit just kind of shrinks.\n\n219\n00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:20.060\nYou probably noticed it\nstutter a little bit there.\n\n220\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.440\nThat wasn't my computer,\nthat's just how that effect works.\n\n221\n00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.710\nIt doesn't render as fast, which means\nit's a little less resource intensive.\n\n222\n00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:26.890\nYou may want to tweak that.\n\n223\n00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.965\nI don't care about a screen effect.\n\n224\n00:09:27.965 --> 00:09:29.350\nI just want it out of\nthe way as fast as I can.\n\n225\n00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.050\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n226\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.020\n&gt;&gt; Then you might choose to do that.\n\n227\n00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:36.020\nAnd that's what a lot of this stuff is, is\nreally just your own preference, how you\n\n228\n00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:41.100\nwant that set up, and you can kinda tweak\nand change that based on your needs.\n\n229\n00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.860\nSo that's that personal section.\n\n230\n00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.850\nSome of the other things you can\ncustomize things like Mission Control.\n\n231\n00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.620\nI'm not a big fan of Mission Control.\n\n232\n00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.150\nI rarely use it, so I normally come in and\ndisable some of the settings in here so\n\n233\n00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.600\nI don't have to encounter it.\n\n234\n00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.360\nBut if you like it,\nyou can tweak it and change it.\n\n235\n00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:02.690\nMission Control,\nif you're not familiar with it,\n\n236\n00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:07.410\nwhat it does it, is if you do a, well,\nit's going to go to my own desktop.\n\n237\n00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.690\nDoesn't let me do the keyboard shortcut.\n\n238\n00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:09.350\nThat'll work better.\n\n239\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.300\nThere we go.\n\n240\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.870\nWhat Mission Control does,\nis it lets you kind of zoom out and\n\n241\n00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.880\nsee the different applications\nthat you've got open.\n\n242\n00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.990\nSo let me open a few different\napplications here just to\n\n243\n00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.770\nkinda get some stuff going.\n\n244\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.990\nAnd so as I launch these things,\nif you three-finger-swipe up, or\n\n245\n00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.510\nyou can hit Ctrl-up arrow,\nit lays out the applications so\n\n246\n00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:32.330\nyou can see each of them unhindered,\nuncovered by the others.\n\n247\n00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.960\nSo you can spot windows\nthat are underneath, and\n\n248\n00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.450\nyou can click on them to bring them up.\n\n249\n00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.060\nYou can also create\nadditional desktops up here.\n\n250\n00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.860\nSo if you want more virtual desktops,\nyou can do that.\n\n251\n00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.110\nAnd then you can take your\napplications and drag them and\n\n252\n00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.090\ndrop them into the other desktops.\n\n253\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.910\nThat's kind of convenient, because now I\ncan be looking at one desktop and then\n\n254\n00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.747\nflip over to another one, which my virtual\nmachines are gonna get in the way of-\n\n255\n00:10:53.747 --> 00:10:54.311\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n256\n00:10:54.311 --> 00:10:55.377\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you can flip over to the other one.\n\n257\n00:10:55.377 --> 00:10:56.170\nThere we go.\n\n258\n00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.990\nAnd now I'm looking at this other desktop.\n\n259\n00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.640\nIt's the same computer, right?\n\n260\n00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.426\nThis is the same machine.\n\n261\n00:11:01.426 --> 00:11:04.308\nIt's just got another\nVirtual Desktop on it, and so\n\n262\n00:11:04.308 --> 00:11:06.090\nyou can get in between on those.\n\n263\n00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.510\nNow I wasn't able to use my gestures,\nbecause my Virtual Machines take over my\n\n264\n00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.230\ngestures, but\nI can use my keyboard shortcuts.\n\n265\n00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.610\nAnd those keyboard shortcuts\nwere defined in there as well.\n\n266\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.850\nSome people say, I don't use keyboard\nshort cuts because I always forget them.\n\n267\n00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.710\nWell, fine come in here and\nset ones that you can remember.\n\n268\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.178\nAnd now you can define what you want.\n\n269\n00:11:24.178 --> 00:11:27.180\nThe dashboard is the one that I\nalways turn off, because I hate it.\n\n270\n00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:33.497\nBut if we turn that on as a space, this is\nwhat we used to have in as the default.\n\n271\n00:11:33.497 --> 00:11:37.871\nAnd the way it worked was that when you\nscrolled all the way to the left here,\n\n272\n00:11:37.871 --> 00:11:41.204\nyou would see this widget screen,\nand it would show up and\n\n273\n00:11:41.204 --> 00:11:43.720\na lot of us don't like it,\nand turn it off.\n\n274\n00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.739\nSo again, just personal preferences\nthat you can define right in here.\n\n275\n00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:48.510\nSo that's the personal section.\n\n276\n00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.290\nThe next section is hardware.\n\n277\n00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.950\nSo this section is all tailored to\nthe hardware of your computer and\n\n278\n00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.640\nthese are settings that are generally\ngoing to apply to everyone.\n\n279\n00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.430\nAnd depending on the hardware you have,\nyou may see different icons.\n\n280\n00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.740\nIf you have a CD and DVD drive,\nyou'll see the icon for it.\n\n281\n00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.625\nIf you don't have a CD and DVD,\nthen you won't see the icon for it.\n\n282\n00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:08.535\nThere's other ones you'll always see like\nprinters and scanners, even though you\n\n283\n00:12:08.535 --> 00:12:11.550\ndon't have printers, because that's\nwhere you have to go to add printers.\n\n284\n00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.770\nAnd printers are sometimes on the network,\nso that one's always gonna show up.\n\n285\n00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.590\nYou've got sound, track pad,\nkeyboard and mouse.\n\n286\n00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.880\nWe can start to tweak how they function.\n\n287\n00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.560\nSome of these settings may\napply just to you, but\n\n288\n00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.850\nmost of them do apply to\nthe system as a whole.\n\n289\n00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.950\nAnd there's various things\npeople might want to modify.\n\n290\n00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.980\nFor example, a mouse is kind of\na hot button for a lot of users.\n\n291\n00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.650\nFor some people the tracking speed\nis just a little too fast, right.\n\n292\n00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:38.430\nWhen you move your finger across the touch\npad, the arrow just moves a little too\n\n293\n00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.220\nfast or a little too slow, so\nyou can tweak and adjust it.\n\n294\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.460\nRight now I'm on the fourth setting.\n\n295\n00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.220\nSo I can crank it all the way up to first,\nand when I apply that,\n\n296\n00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.290\nthis mouse cursor will just\nwhip across the screen,\n\n297\n00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.740\nsometimes a little too fast for\nme to be able to control.\n\n298\n00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.270\nSo you can kind of dictate that.\n\n299\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.560\nThe double click speed.\n\n300\n00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.930\nHow quickly you have to press the mouse\nbutton twice to count as a click.\n\n301\n00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:06.272\nSome people, especially if you have any\nkind of a motor skill degradation or\n\n302\n00:13:06.272 --> 00:13:09.703\nsomething, which can\njust happen with old age.\n\n303\n00:13:09.703 --> 00:13:11.988\nOr you might have Parkinson's,\nor something more significant.\n\n304\n00:13:11.988 --> 00:13:15.272\nIt can be very difficult to double click,\nor it might be too easy to double click.\n\n305\n00:13:15.272 --> 00:13:16.627\n&gt;&gt; Like a tremor or\nsomething like that, and\n\n306\n00:13:16.627 --> 00:13:18.343\nyou are accidentally double\nclicking all the time.\n\n307\n00:13:18.343 --> 00:13:21.800\nYou wanna set that to a bit of\na faster speed or something.\n\n308\n00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.613\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you've ever\nworked with somebody like that,\n\n309\n00:13:23.613 --> 00:13:24.457\nit is a nightmare for them.\n\n310\n00:13:24.457 --> 00:13:26.767\nIt really ruins the computer experience,\nso\n\n311\n00:13:26.767 --> 00:13:29.652\nbeing able to adjust\nthat is really important.\n\n312\n00:13:29.652 --> 00:13:31.570\nFor your left handed or\nright handed people,\n\n313\n00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.240\nit's nice to be able to flip which\nbutton is the primary button.\n\n314\n00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.380\nIf you've got a button\nenabled mouse on a touch pad,\n\n315\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.050\nwe usually don't have\nthat kind of problem.\n\n316\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.450\nAnd then what your scrolling speed is for\nwhen you're scrolling.\n\n317\n00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.535\nSo those are some settings that again,\njust help you to better make use\n\n318\n00:13:44.535 --> 00:13:47.636\nof the system and take advantage of\nthe resources that are available.\n\n319\n00:13:47.636 --> 00:13:49.430\nSo that is the hardware section.\n\n320\n00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.040\nThe third section is called Internet and\nWireless.\n\n321\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.635\nAnd these are the official\ntitles from Apple.\n\n322\n00:13:56.635 --> 00:13:58.940\nI know it doesn't say it here on\nthe screen, but that is what it's called.\n\n323\n00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.160\nIt's Internet and Wireless.\n\n324\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.660\nAnd so most everything in here is tied\nto Internet access or network access.\n\n325\n00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.920\nAt first glance, I don't see\nwireless in the list at all, but\n\n326\n00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.300\nit's big enough to be in the name.\n\n327\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.370\nIt's just under network.\n\n328\n00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.920\nRight?\nSo the wireless settings are tucked\n\n329\n00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.980\nunder network as well.\n\n330\n00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.844\nBut as far as Internet, you've got your\niCloud account and Internet account, so\n\n331\n00:14:17.844 --> 00:14:21.328\nthese are gonna be like email and\ncalendar, and so on for other services.\n\n332\n00:14:21.328 --> 00:14:24.765\nSo if you go into Internet, you'll see\nwhere you can add Microsoft Exchange,\n\n333\n00:14:24.765 --> 00:14:26.549\nGoogle, Twitter, Facebook and so on.\n\n334\n00:14:26.549 --> 00:14:30.552\nYou've got an iCloud in here also,\nbut this would be iCloud from a email,\n\n335\n00:14:30.552 --> 00:14:32.814\ncontacts, and calendars perspective,\n\n336\n00:14:32.814 --> 00:14:35.740\nnot all the other stuff\nthat we get what iCloud.\n\n337\n00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.860\nIf I go back, this iCloud option is\nthe one that gives me all the other stuff\n\n338\n00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.340\nthat we may choose to use,\nthe iCloud Drive, and Back to My Mac, and\n\n339\n00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.330\nFind My iPhone, and all those other\ndifferent things are tied with that.\n\n340\n00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.553\nSo that's the full iCloud service versus\njust the email and contact signs.\n\n341\n00:14:52.553 --> 00:14:53.941\nYou've got your app store.\n\n342\n00:14:53.941 --> 00:14:56.990\nThat is where we do all\nof our updates from now.\n\n343\n00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.330\nSo when you get software updates, they're\ncoming right out of that app store, and\n\n344\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.460\nthat's a pretty important one.\n\n345\n00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.740\nWe're gonna talk more about\nupdates a little bit later.\n\n346\n00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.010\nSo I'll gloss over that for now.\n\n347\n00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.310\nExtensions, these are add-ons that\nhave been brought into the system.\n\n348\n00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.590\nAs you install additional hardware, you\nmay have drivers that need to be loaded\n\n349\n00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.560\nand they'll typically\nshow up under extensions.\n\n350\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.030\nAnd if you click on that, you'll see\nwhere you can also tweak other things.\n\n351\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:24.542\nThings like how your photos are loaded,\nyour share menu and so on.\n\n352\n00:15:24.542 --> 00:15:28.174\nAll of this is going to vary as you\ninstall software, as you tweak and\n\n353\n00:15:28.174 --> 00:15:29.290\nchange things.\n\n354\n00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:34.178\nThis is extending the base\nfunctionality of Mac OS.\n\n355\n00:15:34.178 --> 00:15:36.060\nI'm on a new install, so\nI have no third party stuff.\n\n356\n00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.451\nAnd after that we've got networking.\n\n357\n00:15:39.451 --> 00:15:42.058\nNetworking is where the wireless stuff\nshows up, so if you have a wireless\n\n358\n00:15:42.058 --> 00:15:44.998\nadapter, I guess I don't technically\nhave a wireless adapter on this machine.\n\n359\n00:15:44.998 --> 00:15:48.040\nIf we were to look at my own desktop here,\nlet me switch back to mine.\n\n360\n00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.670\nIn my laptop I have a wireless adapter.\n\n361\n00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.550\nSo when I go under networking,\nI see my WiFi and\n\n362\n00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.740\nI can get all the wireless\nnetwork set up and so on.\n\n363\n00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.436\nAnd so again,\nvaries based on your hardware.\n\n364\n00:15:57.436 --> 00:15:59.893\nIn fact,\nif you take a look at my laptop here,\n\n365\n00:15:59.893 --> 00:16:03.539\nnotice how under the hardware section,\nI don't have CD and DVDs.\n\n366\n00:16:03.539 --> 00:16:05.929\nBecause I don't have a CD or\nDVD drive in my laptop, so\n\n367\n00:16:05.929 --> 00:16:08.250\nthat one is missing like I described.\n\n368\n00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.120\nBut if I go under Extensions,\nI bet I have a lot more in here.\n\n369\n00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.785\nYeah, you'll see where I've got a Dropbox\nextension, Microsoft OneNote, Pixelmator.\n\n370\n00:16:14.785 --> 00:16:17.636\nThese are other applications\nthat have extended out the OS.\n\n371\n00:16:17.636 --> 00:16:19.339\nAnd I have even more,\nlike my hardware drivers,\n\n372\n00:16:19.339 --> 00:16:21.630\nthey just don't show up here\ncuz they are not configurable.\n\n373\n00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.562\nThe drivers are either installed or\nnot installed, so\n\n374\n00:16:23.562 --> 00:16:24.822\nthey don't show up in this screen.\n\n375\n00:16:27.336 --> 00:16:29.280\nAll right, let me go back to this system.\n\n376\n00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.570\nAnd, in addition to networking,\nthe last one we got is sharing.\n\n377\n00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.780\nAnd we're gonna take a look at\nsharing in its own episode.\n\n378\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.960\nBut that's where we can share files,\nfolders, we can share our screen,\n\n379\n00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.700\nour printers.\n\n380\n00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.823\nThere's all sorts of different things that\nwe can share and give people access to.\n\n381\n00:16:42.823 --> 00:16:46.678\nSo this is all right here in\nthe Internet and Wireless.\n\n382\n00:16:46.678 --> 00:16:49.140\nAll right, the next section is System.\n\n383\n00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.950\nAnd the System settings are ones\nthat configure macOS itself, so\n\n384\n00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:55.040\nthe actual operating system,\nand how it how it behaves.\n\n385\n00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.180\nThis is things like the user accounts,\nright?\n\n386\n00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.950\nDoes a user account affect one user or\nall users?\n\n387\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.091\nTechnically it only affects one user,\nbut it's creating that one user, so\n\n388\n00:17:03.091 --> 00:17:04.723\nit can't be stored in the user itself.\n\n389\n00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:07.930\nSo it's stored in the operating system,\nand that's why it's tied here.\n\n390\n00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.530\nSame thing with Parental Controls.\n\n391\n00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.858\nParent Controls apply to a user account,\nso they can't be stored in the user\n\n392\n00:17:12.858 --> 00:17:15.679\naccount, otherwise the user\nwould just turn them off, right?\n\n393\n00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:16.922\nSo they're stored as part of the system.\n\n394\n00:17:16.922 --> 00:17:17.531\n&gt;&gt; Kids are smart.\n\n395\n00:17:17.531 --> 00:17:22.040\n[LAUGH] They find that stuff really quick\nand go, I'll just shut this off, so.\n\n396\n00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.180\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing, it's amazing, yeah.\n\n397\n00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.740\nKids start with computers so early\nthese days, that they learn the ins and\n\n398\n00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.860\nouts pretty fast.\n\n399\n00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.710\nWe've got Siri, which some people love,\nsome people hate, but\n\n400\n00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.800\nthe functionality's here.\n\n401\n00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.090\nSiri is enabled by default.\n\n402\n00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:37.820\nIf I look up here, actually I'm I\nlying to you is Siri not enabled?\n\n403\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.270\nIts cuz I'm not signed in to iCloud.\n\n404\n00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.100\nIf we're signed in to iCloud Siri would\nenable itself and it would show up there.\n\n405\n00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.615\nIn my case, I haven't done updates yet\nand I'm not signed in to iCloud.\n\n406\n00:17:44.615 --> 00:17:46.450\nIt's a new install, so its not happening.\n\n407\n00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.235\nBut if I go into Siri,\nwe can get that turned on.\n\n408\n00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.100\nWe can just go and turn it on, right?\n\n409\n00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.950\nSo I'll go ahead and enable it and\nget it set up and so now I got Siri.\n\n410\n00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:59.210\nAnd when I go up here I'll see I've got my\nlittle Siri button right there at the top.\n\n411\n00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.819\nIf I've done my updates and\nstuff it would turn on that way to, but\n\n412\n00:18:01.819 --> 00:18:04.700\nthat's a another thing that we\ncan get configured if we want it.\n\n413\n00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.680\nThe Date and Time of the system,\nreal important to have that set\n\n414\n00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.590\nright because things like encryption\nrelies on you having correct clock.\n\n415\n00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.800\nNot just clock, but your timezone,\nthat you're in the right timezone.\n\n416\n00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.330\nCuz I might have my clock set right.\n\n417\n00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.930\nHey, it shows that it's 2:30 PM,\nbut if it shows that I'm at UTC and\n\n418\n00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:25.910\nI'm actually in Eastern, then it's gonna\nbe off by five hours or four hours and\n\n419\n00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.450\nthings really don't work\neven though it look right.\n\n420\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.440\nSo we need to make sure\nwe have that set up.\n\n421\n00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.904\nTime Machine for backing up our computer.\n\n422\n00:18:30.904 --> 00:18:33.386\nWe'll take a look at Time Machine\nin a dedicated episode.\n\n423\n00:18:33.386 --> 00:18:34.910\nAnd then, Accessibility.\n\n424\n00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:39.330\nThese are options that really help\npeople interact with the computer.\n\n425\n00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.910\nAnd originally, these were designed for\npeople with disabilities.\n\n426\n00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:47.730\nBut it's grown so much over the years that\nreally everybody can take advantage of\n\n427\n00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.840\nthe accessibility options to make\nthe computer easier to work with.\n\n428\n00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.920\nSo for example,\nyou'll see throughout this whole series,\n\n429\n00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.360\nthat I use this zoom function a lot.\n\n430\n00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.340\nThat I zoom in on things,\ncuz things are small on these modern\n\n431\n00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.630\nmonitors that are high DPI where\nyou've got retina screens.\n\n432\n00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.820\nThings can tend to be small and\nthat's frustrating.\n\n433\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.981\nWell, if you going to accessibility,\n\n434\n00:19:06.981 --> 00:19:09.736\nthere's an accessibility\nfeature called Zoom.\n\n435\n00:19:09.736 --> 00:19:17.330\nAnd with Zoom, you can turn on the ability\nto do a Ctrl two finger swipe to zoom in.\n\n436\n00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.150\nAnd that let you zoom in and\nsee things really easily.\n\n437\n00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:25.010\nSo if you have poor eyesight like mine or\nany other kind of visual impairment or\n\n438\n00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:29.150\nyou just like to be able to read stuff,\nit's nice to be able to zoom like that.\n\n439\n00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.890\nYou got Voiceover, where it can\nactually read the text to you.\n\n440\n00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.250\nYou can always say Cmd + F5,\npretty much anywhere and\n\n441\n00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.880\nit will start to read the text\nthat is on the screen.\n\n442\n00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.660\nYou've got other things,\nthe Speech customization's.\n\n443\n00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.610\nWe'll talk about those in another episode.\n\n444\n00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.950\nAs well as other options here to try and\ntweak and\n\n445\n00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.220\nmake the system easier to work with.\n\n446\n00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.320\nIf I had a braille keyboard hooked up,\nit would show up here, also,\n\n447\n00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.730\nto be able to go in and configure that.\n\n448\n00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.180\nI don't have one, so we can't see that.\n\n449\n00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.370\nBut all those different types\nof options are right here.\n\n450\n00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.420\nNow, that looks like it for\nSystem Preferences but\n\n451\n00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.290\nthere is actually a fifth category.\n\n452\n00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.780\nA fifth category called Other.\n\n453\n00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.690\nAnd the Other category is for\nthird party add-ons to the system.\n\n454\n00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.480\nSo they're not allowed to\ngo into these categories.\n\n455\n00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.600\nThese categories up here\nall defined by Apple.\n\n456\n00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.300\nAnd as you install more stuff,\nthe fifth category will appear.\n\n457\n00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.800\nSo for example, let's say I have\napplication that needs Java.\n\n458\n00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.090\nShoot, I forgot I've got more\nthan one desktop don't I?\n\n459\n00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:25.666\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you do.\n\n460\n00:20:25.666 --> 00:20:31.069\n&gt;&gt; So let me, whoops, let me get rid\nof this other desktop real quick.\n\n461\n00:20:31.069 --> 00:20:32.717\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can do it, Don.\n\n462\n00:20:32.717 --> 00:20:33.445\n&gt;&gt; I'm cursed.\n\n463\n00:20:33.445 --> 00:20:34.221\n&gt;&gt; We believe in you.\n\n464\n00:20:34.221 --> 00:20:35.141\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n465\n00:20:35.141 --> 00:20:38.373\n&gt;&gt; That's why.\n\n466\n00:20:38.373 --> 00:20:39.630\nI can do it.\n\n467\n00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:40.154\nThere we go.\nSorry,\n\n468\n00:20:40.154 --> 00:20:41.760\nI'm just trying to get me\ndown the one desktop here.\n\n469\n00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.630\nAll right [COUGH] so if I wanna\ninstall something like Java, right?\n\n470\n00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.890\nI can go and download it from their\nwebsite and I can install it.\n\n471\n00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.080\nSo I'm gonna just bring it up here and\ninstall it real quick.\n\n472\n00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.190\nAnd when I do the install,\n\n473\n00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:57.090\nJava has its own system preferences\nscreen to be able to configure it.\n\n474\n00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.450\nSo it's gonna show up\nin System Preferences.\n\n475\n00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.970\nAnd it's going to create\nthat Other category for me,\n\n476\n00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.770\nthe category that doesn't exist yet\nit's about to.\n\n477\n00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.610\nAnd so, I will leave my preferences open\nhere in background so we see it happen.\n\n478\n00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.750\nI definitely wanna set\nYahoo as my home page\n\n479\n00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.341\n&gt;&gt; That's the best homepage ever.\n\n480\n00:21:13.341 --> 00:21:14.150\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n481\n00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.020\nAnd there we go,\n3 billion devices using Java,\n\n482\n00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.663\nbut 3 billion devices are not\nusing Yahoo as their home page.\n\n483\n00:21:20.663 --> 00:21:21.740\nSo we'll let that install.\n\n484\n00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.991\nWhen it's done, so there it is done.\n\n485\n00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:26.377\nAnd now it's gonna launch\nthis little test page.\n\n486\n00:21:26.377 --> 00:21:28.250\nIt's gonna cover up what\nI wanted to show you.\n\n487\n00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.700\nNow, looking at my System Preferences\nhere, things don't look any different.\n\n488\n00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.590\nAnd that's because this is not dynamic,\nright?\n\n489\n00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.652\nIt didn't refresh.\n\n490\n00:21:34.652 --> 00:21:36.590\nThey don't really give\nme a way to refresh it.\n\n491\n00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.040\nBut if I close out of my\nSystem Preferences and I go right back in,\n\n492\n00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:45.260\nwhen I go back in, now, that magical\nfifth category just appeared and\n\n493\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.980\nI can see there's the Java\nsystem preference.\n\n494\n00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.280\nThat's the Other section.\n\n495\n00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.900\nAnd the longer you work with your system,\nthe more stuff will appear there.\n\n496\n00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.010\nSo if you look at my actual laptop,\nlet's just go back to this thing.\n\n497\n00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.750\nIn my actual laptop, looking at my Other,\nI've got all sorts of stuff in here.\n\n498\n00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.870\nLike my Blackmagic video recorder\nhas its own little panel.\n\n499\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:05.951\nLet me get rid of that.\n\n500\n00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:11.730\nAnd then we've got Chrome Remote Desktop,\nFUSE which is an extra file system driver.\n\n501\n00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.730\nGPG which is a file encryption and\ndecryption, use it for\n\n502\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.090\ndigitally signing email.\n\n503\n00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.450\nThere's Java, my Logitech Control Center\nfor my wireless keyboard and\n\n504\n00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:20.700\nmouse in the office.\n\n505\n00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.950\nAnd my Xbox 360 controller\ndriver because mission critical.\n\n506\n00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:24.597\n&gt;&gt; Most important thing.\n\n507\n00:22:24.597 --> 00:22:25.155\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n508\n00:22:25.155 --> 00:22:27.550\nthese are all things that I've added on.\n\n509\n00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.030\nAnd so, they show up right down\nhere under the Other section.\n\n510\n00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.990\nBut the rest of it's all pretty consistent\nwith what you would expect to see\n\n511\n00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.870\nwith a Mac as you work with it.\n\n512\n00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.370\nSo you may see more icons,\nyou may see less.\n\n513\n00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.910\nBut these are the system preferences and\npeople tweak things a lot.\n\n514\n00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:48.570\nFor example, I know for me, I like to\ntweak what icons show up on my desktop.\n\n515\n00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:52.400\nThat's another preference, actually\nnot in here, you'd think it would be.\n\n516\n00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.940\nBut if I go into my Finder, for example,\nFinder has its own preferences.\n\n517\n00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.560\nAnd so, if you go up here to Finder and\nPreferences,\n\n518\n00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:04.160\nyou've got the option to tweak\nthings that show up on your desktop.\n\n519\n00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.970\nSo here you go,\nshow this items on the desktop.\n\n520\n00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.910\nAnd hard disks and connective\nservers are not enabled by default.\n\n521\n00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:14.580\nAnd so I always come in and turn those on\nbecause I'm used to seeing my hard drives,\n\n522\n00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:18.710\nmy USB hard drives, my servers\nthat I've remotely connected to,\n\n523\n00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.370\nI'm used to seeing them on my desktop,\nI like to have them there.\n\n524\n00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.570\nBut by default it's hidden.\n\n525\n00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:27.540\nSo, these are all things that people\ntweak and customize on the computer,\n\n526\n00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.710\nand when you get a new computer,\nyou've got to get it set back up that way.\n\n527\n00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:35.074\nAnd it just takes a bit of work to get\nthat put in place, but once you've got it\n\n528\n00:23:35.074 --> 00:23:38.350\nin there, now you're back to the way\nyou had it, you can get back to work.\n\n529\n00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.524\nAnd it's just a new computer,\nbut configured the old way, so\n\n530\n00:23:41.524 --> 00:23:44.830\nyou're efficient at peak\nproductivity right there on day one.\n\n531\n00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:46.330\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n532\n00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.440\nWell, now we've gone through all\nthat cool system preferences,\n\n533\n00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.570\nsystem options that are inside\nof our Mac operating system.\n\n534\n00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.720\nWhere else would we go?\n\n535\n00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.386\nI think probably one of the big\ncontenders would probably be getting on\n\n536\n00:23:56.386 --> 00:23:57.299\nthe Internet, right?\n\n537\n00:23:57.299 --> 00:23:58.155\nI wanna add some networking.\n\n538\n00:23:58.155 --> 00:24:01.089\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we got a lot of odds and\nends that we still need to do, so\n\n539\n00:24:01.089 --> 00:24:03.440\nlike configuring networking, right?\n\n540\n00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.570\nRemember we started this part, in Part\n1 with the five apple steps, right?\n\n541\n00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.440\nAnd one of those was\nconfiguring networking.\n\n542\n00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.000\nBut then we have software updates\nthat we still need to configure and\n\n543\n00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.970\nwe need to talk about a few other things\nthat happen in a workplace environment.\n\n544\n00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.070\nBut I know we don't really have\nquite enough time in this episode,\n\n545\n00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.370\nso let's do a Part 3 Daniel, so\nI can hit each of those other topics.\n\n546\n00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.760\nAnd make sure that we're nice and\nthorough on the initial setup.\n\n547\n00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.830\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good, Don.\n\n548\n00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.160\nI think I called this one,\nactually, in the previous episode.\n\n549\n00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.970\nI was like, we're going into Part 3,\n\n550\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.230\nnow we're actually going to\nhave to go into a Part 3.\n\n551\n00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:35.045\nSo, listen to the previous me tell\nthe now me that I was correct.\n\n552\n00:24:35.045 --> 00:24:35.709\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n553\n00:24:35.709 --> 00:24:38.030\n&gt;&gt; That's kind of fun,a\nlittle time paradox there.\n\n554\n00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.290\nDon, thanks for joining us today.\n\n555\n00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.810\nWe do thank our audience for watching.\n\n556\n00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.770\nBut like you said we're a little out\nof time for this episode, come back for\n\n557\n00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:44.980\nmore on Part 3.\n\n558\n00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.140\nAs for right now though we're signing\noff for ITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n559\n00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:48.970\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n560\n00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:49.870\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n561\n00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.490\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n562\n00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:57.279\n[MUSIC]\n\n563\n00:24:57.279 --> 00:24:59.355\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:10.843\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:13.436\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.436 --> 00:00:16.814\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.814 --> 00:00:20.092\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, well,\n\n7\n00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:23.117\nwe are continuing on with out\nlovely series On the ACSP and\n\n8\n00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:26.584\nof course joining us in the studio yet\nagain for more on the initial\n\n9\n00:00:26.584 --> 00:00:30.710\nconfiguration setup, very good stuff so\nfar, our good friend Mr Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.080\nDon, we're glad to have you yet again.\n\n11\n00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.840\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.560\n&gt;&gt; It is going swell and\nyou know we're ready to kind of\n\n13\n00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.310\nwind up some of the last odds and\nends of the initial setup of a machine.\n\n14\n00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.280\nI know we've already got two\nepisodes under our belt, so\n\n15\n00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.760\nit seems like gosh,\nwe spent an hour doing this initial setup.\n\n16\n00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.680\nOkay, I've rumbled on a lot so you do\nthis stuff in 10 minutes in life LAN.\n\n17\n00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.520\nBut we do have a few more things that\nwe just need to get taken care of\n\n18\n00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.700\nbefore we're ready to turn our\ncomputer loose on the new end-user and\n\n19\n00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.310\nlet them go about their day.\n\n20\n00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.270\n&gt;&gt; That's right, now in the very\nend of the last episode I said,\n\n21\n00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.480\nyou know what, most people like their\ncomputers on some sort of Internet and\n\n22\n00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.760\naccessing things like Facebook and\nITPro.TV right?\n\n23\n00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.410\nWe want them to have that\nexperience on their new Mac but\n\n24\n00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.250\nit doesn't, well it sometimes just\nworks but you do have to connect it.\n\n25\n00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.820\nYou got a couple little odds and\n\n26\n00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.400\nends you've got to configure to\nmake the networking work, correct?\n\n27\n00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.100\n&gt;&gt; That's right yeah a lot of\nnetworks use a technology called\n\n28\n00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.080\nDHCP which is the dynamic\nhost configuration protocol.\n\n29\n00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.540\nAnd the way DHCP works is, when you\nplug in a new computer to the network\n\n30\n00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.990\nthe computer shouts out a message and that\nmessage says, hey can somebody please give\n\n31\n00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.780\nme an IP address, a subnet mask,\na router to use, DNS services.\n\n32\n00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.140\nCan you give me all this\nnetwork configuration?\n\n33\n00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.410\nAnd if there's a DHCP server on\nthe network, you'll hear that and\n\n34\n00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.120\nthey'll answer back and\nthey'll say, yeah, here you go.\n\n35\n00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.430\nHere's your IP, here's your subnet.\n\n36\n00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.130\nHere's all this other data, good luck.\n\n37\n00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.040\nAnd then the client takes that, uses\nit and it's configured for the network.\n\n38\n00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.030\nIt's all automatic, which is great.\n\n39\n00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.300\nWell, the thing is, there's a few things\nthat can make that not work so well.\n\n40\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.340\nThe main thing is that for\nDHCP to properly function and\n\n41\n00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.990\nbe completely automatic, we're talking\nabout a physical network connection.\n\n42\n00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.680\nWell, if you have a Mac Pro, or a iMac or\n\n43\n00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.130\na Mac mini, they all have physical\nnetwork connections on them.\n\n44\n00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.740\nAnd if you take them and\nplug them into a network,\n\n45\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.280\nthe odds are it is going to just work.\n\n46\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.110\nYou don't have to do anything.\n\n47\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.170\nYou plug it in, you're in business, right.\n\n48\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.730\nBut If you've got a Macbook Pro or\na Macbook, they use wireless.\n\n49\n00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.650\nThey don't have a physical\nnetwork jack on them.\n\n50\n00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.970\nYou can't just plug in and it just works.\n\n51\n00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.010\nMaybe if you have the dongle for\na network adapter, you could,\n\n52\n00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.160\nbut otherwise, you're going to\nhave to get them configured.\n\n53\n00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.940\nFor a wireless network we have to specify\nthe wireless network to connect to,\n\n54\n00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.110\non the physical network side it's\nusually automatic although we might\n\n55\n00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.280\nhave to specify a static IP address.\n\n56\n00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.420\nNot every where has a DHCP server,\nalthough most places do.\n\n57\n00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.540\nSo the initial network configuration\nis gonna vary just a little bit\n\n58\n00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.530\nbased on whether it's a physical network\nadapter or a wireless network adapter.\n\n59\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.540\nBut there are some things\nthat are in common.\n\n60\n00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.630\nI wanna start with wireless because\nwireless is a little bit different.\n\n61\n00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.090\nWith physical,\nyou just plug a cable in and\n\n62\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.470\nyour technically connected to the network.\n\n63\n00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.750\nYou might have the wrong IP or\nno IP but you're technically connected.\n\n64\n00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.970\nWireless, you're not connected until\nyou select a wireless network from\n\n65\n00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.300\nyour wireless network utility.\n\n66\n00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.350\nSo, let me show you that\nprocess real quick.\n\n67\n00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.710\nIt's pretty intuitive.\n\n68\n00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.740\nWhen you fire up a MAC that\nhas a wireless adapter,\n\n69\n00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.630\nyou'll see this little\nicon up in your menu bars.\n\n70\n00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.860\nIts these little, supposed to be\nradio waves going out into the air.\n\n71\n00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.220\nAnd if you are not connected to a wireless\nnetwork, this little icon here,\n\n72\n00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.650\ninstead of showing the four\nlines will just be empty.\n\n73\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.000\nIt will have an empty little\nupside down cone or I don't know,\n\n74\n00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.280\nwhatever the heck you'd call that thing,\nbut it would be empty.\n\n75\n00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.160\nAnd when you click on it,\n\n76\n00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.250\nyou see a list of the wireless networks\nthat are available for you to connect to.\n\n77\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.810\nSo you can choose one and connect.\n\n78\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.530\nNow, when you connect, if the network\nhas a little lock icon beside it,\n\n79\n00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.870\nthen you're going to be prompted for\na password.\n\n80\n00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.360\nIf it doesn't have a lock icon,\nthen it has no password.\n\n81\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.840\nIt's an open network, and\nyou can connect right to.\n\n82\n00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.160\nAnd so one just appeared with there.\n\n83\n00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.740\nGainesville Dev Academy-guest,\nI can connect to them,\n\n84\n00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.360\nand they don't have a password.\n\n85\n00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.910\nIt's a public network that\nthey're providing, and\n\n86\n00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.810\nwe can just connect up and go.\n\n87\n00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.270\nBut I use the ITProTV network,\nit does require a password.\n\n88\n00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.130\nSo when you choose one like that,\nlike if I go to ITProTV-Guest Right.\n\n89\n00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.650\nI'm gonna go in and connect to it, and\nit says that it requires a password,\n\n90\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.100\nso I'm gonna punch in whatever\nthat password happens to be,\n\n91\n00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.660\nwhich I might know that password,\nlet's see.\n\n92\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.150\nWe will try and join it, and\nassuming we type in the right password,\n\n93\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.220\nwe'll get connected.\n\n94\n00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.500\nSo right there I was trying to connect and\n\n95\n00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.810\nnow it goes to the four bars letting\nme know that it is connected.\n\n96\n00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.270\n&gt;&gt; I believe those are radio\nwaves coming out of it.\n\n97\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.260\n&gt;&gt; It's supposed to be yeah.\n\n98\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.370\n&gt;&gt; This little RF stuff.\n\n99\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.040\nSo, there we are.\n\n100\n00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.665\nWe're connected and we're in business.\n\n101\n00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:53.710\nNow,that's all I had to do.\n\n102\n00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.430\nIt practically just worked I\njust had to type a password.\n\n103\n00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.820\nPhysical network you plug in and\nit does just work.\n\n104\n00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.800\nIn both scenarios though we're\nassuming there's a DHCP server.\n\n105\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.840\nWhat if there isn't?\n\n106\n00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.060\nLet me show you.\nI'm going to switch back to\n\n107\n00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.720\nITProTv just so I'm on the right network.\n\n108\n00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.770\nThere we go.\n\n109\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.050\nAnd if I take a computer like this one.\n\n110\n00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.520\nThis is another Mac the one I was\nusing in the last episode right?\n\n111\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.010\nSo the one we did the initial install on.\n\n112\n00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.080\nI'm going to go into\nmy system preferences.\n\n113\n00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.970\nAnd in the system preferences\nyou'll find network and\n\n114\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.520\ninside network you'll find\nyour different adapters.\n\n115\n00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.520\nNow if you have a ethernet adapter\nright just a physical connection.\n\n116\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.070\nIt will look something like this.\n\n117\n00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:36.190\nIt is set to use DHCP by default and it is\ngoing to try and get an automatic address.\n\n118\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.630\nIf it does all this information\nwill fill itself in and\n\n119\n00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.870\nnow you are ready to communicate.\n\n120\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.490\nRight if it do not get a DHCP address then\n\n121\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.460\nwhat you need to do is switch that to\nmanual and type in the address that is\n\n122\n00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.100\ngiven to you by your network\nadministrators or system administrators.\n\n123\n00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.230\nWhoever is running the network.\n\n124\n00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.490\nIf that's you then you need to pick\nan IP address on your network and\n\n125\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.370\nplug it in here.\n\n126\n00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.680\nAnd so I can manually type in\nwhatever that happens to be.\n\n127\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.240\nAnd its different for\ndifferent networks, so\n\n128\n00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.570\nyou'll need to check your documentation.\n\n129\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.820\nWhoever designed your network\npicked the IP scheme to use and\n\n130\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.220\nyou just need to follow it and\nyou need to punch that in.\n\n131\n00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.330\nNow at a minimum you have to\nprovide an IP address and\n\n132\n00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.310\na subnet mask and that's it, right.\n\n133\n00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.110\nAnd if you stop right there you'll be able\nto talk to all the other computers on your\n\n134\n00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.380\nnetwork and that's it.\n\n135\n00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.510\nBut if we want to get out to the internet,\nwe've got to go a step further and\n\n136\n00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.060\nprovide the IP address of\na router to go through.\n\n137\n00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.900\nAnd then DNS servers to use.\n\n138\n00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.100\nNow, it doesn't let me\ntype DNS servers here.\n\n139\n00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.040\nI have to go into the Advanced screen, and\nunder Advanced, there's a DNS tab, and\n\n140\n00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.710\nwe can add our DNS servers right there.\n\n141\n00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.810\nYou need DNS because it\ntranslates names to IPs.\n\n142\n00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.215\nWhen I type www.apple.com into my web\nbrowser, that gets resolved into an IP\n\n143\n00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:50.590\naddress.fcdxsaCS And we'll take a look\nat that in the networking episodes and\n\n144\n00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.630\nsee that more in depth later on,\nbut for now,\n\n145\n00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.210\njust know that you need to put this\ninformation in in order for it to work.\n\n146\n00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.930\nThe same is true for Wi-Fi,\nexcept on the Wi-Fi screen,\n\n147\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.380\nit looks a little bit different.\n\n148\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.680\nLet me go back to my laptop.\n\n149\n00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.940\nAnd I'll go into my System Preferences.\n\n150\n00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.720\nAnd into Networking.\n\n151\n00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.780\nAll right, now, when I look at my\nthunderbolt to ethernet adapter,\n\n152\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.640\nit looks just like the screen I just\nshowed you on the other system, right?\n\n153\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.250\nExcept on the other system,\nit was a physical ethernet jack.\n\n154\n00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.610\nThis one is on a dongle, right, so\nit's a thunderbolt ethernet adapter.\n\n155\n00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.260\nBut right beneath it, I have my Wi-Fi.\n\n156\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.540\nAnd notice when I choose Wi-Fi,\nall that IP address stuff isn't there.\n\n157\n00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.240\nRight, where do I pick DHCP or\nmanual address?\n\n158\n00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.190\nIt's not there.\n\n159\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.870\nAnd the reason is,\n\n160\n00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.870\nwhen you choose Wi-Fi, it's defaulting to\nselecting the wireless network, the SSID.\n\n161\n00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.660\nAnd you have to go into Advanced\nto customize it further.\n\n162\n00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.930\nAnd when you go into Advanced,\nyou'll see where you have a TCP/IP tab And\n\n163\n00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.640\nthere is the settings that we\nhad under the physical adapter.\n\n164\n00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.370\nSo, it's moved into a different place.\n\n165\n00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.210\nBut the settings are there.\n\n166\n00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.159\nI can still come and\nthen choose to go manual.\n\n167\n00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:57.036\nAnd I can type in the IP,\nsubnet, and router.\n\n168\n00:07:57.036 --> 00:08:01.618\nAnd I can switch over to the DNS tab,\nand I can put in the name servers,\n\n169\n00:08:01.618 --> 00:08:03.360\nright there, right.\n\n170\n00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.848\nSo the settings are still their,\n\n171\n00:08:04.848 --> 00:08:07.516\nthey're just kinda moved into\na slightly different spot.\n\n172\n00:08:07.516 --> 00:08:10.001\nBut once you've got that set up for\nyour network,\n\n173\n00:08:10.001 --> 00:08:13.610\nnow you're ready to communicate and\nyou can get to other machines on your\n\n174\n00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:18.070\nnetwork as well as get out to the internet\nor other networks that you need to access.\n\n175\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.260\nThat's a critical step in this day and\nage of network computing,\n\n176\n00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.580\nwe need to get the network\nconfigured to function.\n\n177\n00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.150\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\nit actually sets us up for\n\n178\n00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.530\nthe very next thing that we need to do,\nwhich is not go to Facebook.\n\n179\n00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.042\nAll right, that's fine, right?\n\n180\n00:08:32.042 --> 00:08:34.422\nBut is to get software updates, right?\n\n181\n00:08:34.422 --> 00:08:36.702\nThat's a critical step in initial setup,\n\n182\n00:08:36.702 --> 00:08:40.630\nbecause just because you have the latest\nand greatest operating system,\n\n183\n00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.890\ndoesn't mean you have the latest and\ngreatest patches.\n\n184\n00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:44.540\nIsn't that right, Don?\n\n185\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.168\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely right.\n\n186\n00:08:45.168 --> 00:08:47.907\nUpdates are constantly coming out for\nMac OS.\n\n187\n00:08:47.907 --> 00:08:51.783\nAnd we've talked about this before,\nthat Mac OS is a very stable and\n\n188\n00:08:51.783 --> 00:08:53.360\nsecure operating system.\n\n189\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.760\nAnd the main reason for that,\n\n190\n00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.750\nIs that Apple takes great care to patch\nvulnerabilities as fast as they can and\n\n191\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.180\nautomatically push those updates out\nto all the machines that are out there.\n\n192\n00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.960\nIf you're doing those automatic updates,\nthen you're protected and\n\n193\n00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.660\nthat's why we don't have to worry about\nthings like anti-virus on our Mac.\n\n194\n00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.630\nBut if you're not doing those updates,\nthen you are vulnerable.\n\n195\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.080\nYou could be attacked and\nyou could lose data.\n\n196\n00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.660\nThat would be really bad.\n\n197\n00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:21.900\nSo we need to make sure we're taking\nthe proper steps to ensure that we\n\n198\n00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.130\nkeep our Mac safe.\n\n199\n00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.665\nNow, it's gonna be\nprodding you quite a bit.\n\n200\n00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:28.985\nAfter you do the initial install,\nI shouldn't have done it.\n\n201\n00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:32.976\nI cleared the little pop-up here before\nthe show, but I got a little pop-up on my\n\n202\n00:09:32.976 --> 00:09:36.265\nscreen here at the top right where\nit's asking me to take the tour,\n\n203\n00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:38.459\nif I wanna take the tour\nof the Mac OS Sierra.\n\n204\n00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:39.283\nWell, I don't wanna.\n\n205\n00:09:39.283 --> 00:09:40.502\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't wanna.\n\n206\n00:09:40.502 --> 00:09:45.179\n&gt;&gt; But before this popped up, there was\nanother pop-up that looked almost the same\n\n207\n00:09:45.179 --> 00:09:48.362\nand it said,\ndo you want to turn on automatic updates?\n\n208\n00:09:48.362 --> 00:09:53.240\nAnd you could choose Yes or\nNot Now and I chose Not Now.\n\n209\n00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:58.211\nBut it could turn those on right away for\nyou just by answering that little pop-up,\n\n210\n00:09:58.211 --> 00:10:00.495\nand now you've got it and your set up.\n\n211\n00:10:00.495 --> 00:10:03.750\nBut what if you're like me and you ignore\nthe bubble and you didn't configure it.\n\n212\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.650\nIt's actually not that\nhard to get it configured.\n\n213\n00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.520\nBut even if I don't,\nit's still bugging me a little bit.\n\n214\n00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.982\nNotice the App Store icon down here has\na little notification bubble on it, a one.\n\n215\n00:10:12.982 --> 00:10:16.075\nThat notification counter is letting\nme know that there's an update\n\n216\n00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:17.270\nwaiting for me.\n\n217\n00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.230\nThe updates for\nMac OS go through the App Store.\n\n218\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.801\nNow if you used older versions of Mac OS,\nif you're new to Sierra back in the day,\n\n219\n00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:27.885\nI think it was 10.7 and earlier,\n\n220\n00:10:27.885 --> 00:10:31.604\nthe updates were actually managed\nby their own separate system.\n\n221\n00:10:31.604 --> 00:10:35.893\nAnd then they got integrated into the app\nstore, so it's all in one place and\n\n222\n00:10:35.893 --> 00:10:39.580\non a positive side that makes it\neasy that we can update our apps and\n\n223\n00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.085\nthe operating system\nall in the same place.\n\n224\n00:10:42.085 --> 00:10:44.226\nOn the negative side,\nit does get tied to the app store, so\n\n225\n00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:46.525\nif you're blocking the app store,\nthat can cause problems.\n\n226\n00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:49.758\nSo we really can't block the App Store\nanymore, which Most of us,\n\n227\n00:10:49.758 --> 00:10:53.540\nwe want the App Store cuz that's where\nwe get our safe and secure apps from.\n\n228\n00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.191\nSo it's a give and take, right?\n\n229\n00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:59.353\nSo we give up a little bit of freedom\nthere in order to make sure that we get\n\n230\n00:10:59.353 --> 00:11:01.267\nour updates reliably and all in one place.\n\n231\n00:11:01.267 --> 00:11:03.266\nNow if I go in the App Store and\ndo the updates,\n\n232\n00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:05.860\nthat's fine but\nthat's kind of a manual things, right?\n\n233\n00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.556\nSo I can launch the App Store, and\nI can go to the Updates tab up here.\n\n234\n00:11:10.556 --> 00:11:13.960\nSee how it's got that number\none counter on it still?\n\n235\n00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.569\nAnd I can choose it and\nI can see updates are available.\n\n236\n00:11:15.569 --> 00:11:18.986\nAnd I can see there's a software\nupdate for my system and\n\n237\n00:11:18.986 --> 00:11:21.180\nit's an operating system update.\n\n238\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.540\nI know that because the icon over\nhere is the Sierra icon right?\n\n239\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.856\nAnd it tells me that it's\nupdating iTunes to 12.6.1 and\n\n240\n00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:33.930\nit's updating macOS Sierra to 10.12.5,\nright?\n\n241\n00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.230\nWell what am I running?\n\n242\n00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:40.145\nIf I go into about this Mac I can see\nthat I am running macOS Sierra 10.12\n\n243\n00:11:40.145 --> 00:11:41.791\npoint nothing, right?\n\n244\n00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:46.510\nWell, sometimes they don't necessarily\ndisplay the sub numbers there.\n\n245\n00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:51.420\nSo you can go into the System Report\nscreen, and you can actually get\n\n246\n00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.000\nthe fully detailed one where it'll\nbreak down exactly what it is.\n\n247\n00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.420\nI'm in the hardware section now,\nif I go down to Software and\n\n248\n00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.480\ninto the operating system.\n\n249\n00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.790\nYou can find the information in here.\n\n250\n00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:04.473\nIt is buried, where is it?\n\n251\n00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:06.005\nIt's buried in here somewhere.\n\n252\n00:12:06.005 --> 00:12:09.940\nWhere you can come in and you can figure\nout exactly what that version is.\n\n253\n00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.200\nI'm actually not seeing it offhand here.\n\n254\n00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.979\nBut I actually may be running the true\nunpatched 12.2, which means 10.12.\n\n255\n00:12:17.979 --> 00:12:18.769\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n256\n00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:22.648\n&gt;&gt; 10.12.1, 10.12.2, 10.12.3,\n\n257\n00:12:22.648 --> 00:12:26.457\neach one contains a collection\nof patches and updates.\n\n258\n00:12:26.457 --> 00:12:28.072\nAnd I've passed on all of those.\n\n259\n00:12:28.072 --> 00:12:30.019\nWell, it's not that I passed on them,\n\n260\n00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:33.041\nwe installed this operating\nsystem here as part of the show.\n\n261\n00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:36.844\nAnd I used installable media\nthat we made earlier on and\n\n262\n00:12:36.844 --> 00:12:41.723\nif I'm using old installable media\nit's that much more important for\n\n263\n00:12:41.723 --> 00:12:43.720\nme to go in and do my updates.\n\n264\n00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.855\nLet's take a look at my actual laptop and\nsee if I go into about this Mac on my\n\n265\n00:12:47.855 --> 00:12:51.080\nactual laptop,\nI can see I'm running 10.12.5.\n\n266\n00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.070\nSo you see how that sub version is\nshowing up right there I can see it.\n\n267\n00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.280\nAnd if I click on it see how\nthat build number just appeared.\n\n268\n00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.357\nRight that's important because sometimes\nthey'll do an update that's not\n\n269\n00:13:02.357 --> 00:13:03.683\nan incremental update.\n\n270\n00:13:03.683 --> 00:13:05.507\nIt won't go to 10.12.6.\n\n271\n00:13:05.507 --> 00:13:08.940\nIt'll be like a patch to 10.12.5 or\nif you're a developer so\n\n272\n00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.245\nI have a developer account.\n\n273\n00:13:10.245 --> 00:13:13.071\nThere'll be multiple\nbuilds of that update.\n\n274\n00:13:13.071 --> 00:13:17.434\nI think for 10.12.5 there were five or\nsix different builds that went through\n\n275\n00:13:17.434 --> 00:13:20.943\nthe beta community, before finally\nbeing released to the public.\n\n276\n00:13:20.943 --> 00:13:24.670\nSo that's what that number is helping us\ndifferentiate, right there at the end.\n\n277\n00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.421\nBut I can see that this one's updated.\n\n278\n00:13:26.421 --> 00:13:28.990\nMy new machine over here is not.\n\n279\n00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.019\nAnd if I hit this update,\nit's going to get them.\n\n280\n00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:34.699\nIt's gonna get all the 0.1,\n0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5.\n\n281\n00:13:34.699 --> 00:13:36.882\nThey're all rolled up, so\nit's not like I have to go and\n\n282\n00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:38.430\ndo all of them individually.\n\n283\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:39.890\nHere's that update.\n\n284\n00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.920\nBut it's waiting on me to do it.\n\n285\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.400\nAnd with this kind of an update.\n\n286\n00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.500\nIt's actually pretty important,\nmaybe not iTunes,\n\n287\n00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.110\nmaybe I don't care bout iTunes, right?\n\n288\n00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.670\nBut the Mac OS Sierra update,\n\n289\n00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:56.490\nthis 10.12.5 it says this\nupdate improves the securities,\n\n290\n00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.030\nstability and compatibility of your\nMac that sounds nice, doesn't it?\n\n291\n00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.638\nAnd if you go into the little more here,\nit gives you some information here.\n\n292\n00:14:03.638 --> 00:14:06.173\nBut the key thing that I wanted\nto point out is this, for\n\n293\n00:14:06.173 --> 00:14:10.047\ndetailed information about the security\ncontent of this update, here's a link.\n\n294\n00:14:10.047 --> 00:14:15.070\nEvery time one of these updates comes out,\nthey release a security bulletin for it.\n\n295\n00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:19.100\nAnd if you click on that, it'll go to\nApple's website and it will detail\n\n296\n00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.210\nthe security vulnerabilities that were\npatched as a part of this update.\n\n297\n00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:27.320\nAnd it helps you to see, like,\nhow important these types of things are.\n\n298\n00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.221\nSo, here's a list of security updates for\ndifferent platforms and\n\n299\n00:14:31.221 --> 00:14:36.705\nhere's the macOS Sierra 10.12.5 security\nupdate, that we're looking at right now.\n\n300\n00:14:36.705 --> 00:14:39.649\nAnd you'll see where there are updates for\nel Capitan, Yosemite, for\n\n301\n00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:43.410\nother operating systems as well, but\nSierra is the one that we care about.\n\n302\n00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.800\nAnd if I click on that,\nI can get the full bulletin, and\n\n303\n00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.920\nhere it's gonna lay out what was wrong,\nright?\n\n304\n00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:54.380\nWhat wasn't working right, what was the\nCVE number, these are the vulnerability\n\n305\n00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.570\nnumbers that are assigned by all\nthe various security companies.\n\n306\n00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.818\nAnd you'll see this is one that was\ndetected by Google Project Zero,\n\n307\n00:15:00.818 --> 00:15:02.506\nit looks like a couple of them were.\n\n308\n00:15:02.506 --> 00:15:07.405\nAnd processing maliciously crafted data\nmay lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n309\n00:15:07.405 --> 00:15:08.462\n&gt;&gt; That sounds bad.\n\n310\n00:15:08.462 --> 00:15:09.217\n&gt;&gt; That is bad.\n\n311\n00:15:09.217 --> 00:15:11.141\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Somebody can create a document,\n\n312\n00:15:11.141 --> 00:15:12.784\nyou think you're opening a PDF, but\n\n313\n00:15:12.784 --> 00:15:15.770\nit's got malicious data in it\nthat causes code execution.\n\n314\n00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.860\nThey could install a back door in your\nsystem, you just opened a PDF, right?\n\n315\n00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.070\nThat's the kinda things that\nhappens with these exploits.\n\n316\n00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.570\nSo that's all being patched,\nwe need to do those updates.\n\n317\n00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.712\nBut not just do the update\nbecause people forget.\n\n318\n00:15:26.712 --> 00:15:30.255\nHow long is this little number 1 been\non the App Store icon down here and\n\n319\n00:15:30.255 --> 00:15:31.640\nI've ignored it?\n\n320\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.273\nWe need to configure automatic updates.\n\n321\n00:15:34.273 --> 00:15:38.934\nIf you go into your System preferences\nthere actually used to be a software\n\n322\n00:15:38.934 --> 00:15:40.813\nupdate system preference but\n\n323\n00:15:40.813 --> 00:15:44.950\nthat went away when it all got\nintegrated into the App Store.\n\n324\n00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.471\nSo when I go into System preferences, I'm\ngonna go to the App Store preference and\n\n325\n00:15:49.471 --> 00:15:53.486\nright in here, you'll see where you\ncan configure automatic updates.\n\n326\n00:15:53.486 --> 00:15:56.198\nMine is set to Automatically check for\nupdates, just going out and\n\n327\n00:15:56.198 --> 00:15:57.850\nseeing if they're there.\n\n328\n00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.753\nIt's downloading the updates\nin the background.\n\n329\n00:16:00.753 --> 00:16:02.540\nBut it's not doing much about it.\n\n330\n00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.240\nWell it's actually installing system\ndata files and security updates but\n\n331\n00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.380\nit's not installing app updates or\nMac OS updates.\n\n332\n00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:14.234\nSo if there's a straight up security\npatch, yeah my system will download it and\n\n333\n00:16:14.234 --> 00:16:15.070\ninstall it.\n\n334\n00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.720\nBut if it's an operating system patch\nthat might include security patches,\n\n335\n00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.700\nit's not doing that one automatic.\n\n336\n00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.410\nWhat you really wanna do is come in and\nturn on all of these,\n\n337\n00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.960\nunless you have a specific reason not to,\nif you have a specific reason to not be\n\n338\n00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.040\nupdating a particular application,\nthen maybe you would go that route.\n\n339\n00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.640\nBut otherwise,\nwe need to be doing updates, and\n\n340\n00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.140\nwe need to be automatic, right?\n\n341\n00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.070\nBy turning these options on.\n\n342\n00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.800\nNow not only when my system see that\nthere's an update available, it'll go\n\n343\n00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.100\nahead and apply it and it'll be on there,\nit'll reboot the computer in the middle of\n\n344\n00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.410\nthe night if it needs be, most updates\ndon't actually require a reboot.\n\n345\n00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.658\nSo it'll just take care of it and\nwhen I come in, in the morning,\n\n346\n00:16:52.658 --> 00:16:56.084\nI log into my computer and it says,\nhey, let me tell you about the new\n\n347\n00:16:56.084 --> 00:16:59.120\nfeatures of this version of Mac OS and\nit's as easy as that.\n\n348\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.675\nRight, and by choosing MacOS updates,\nyou can even do full platform\n\n349\n00:17:03.675 --> 00:17:08.086\nupdates where maybe I'm running\nEl Capitan and Sierra comes out.\n\n350\n00:17:08.086 --> 00:17:10.660\nAnd we do a full platform\nupdate to the new version.\n\n351\n00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.360\nThere's a lot of things that\nneed to be detected there but\n\n352\n00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.670\nwhat we really care about\nare the security updates and\n\n353\n00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.670\nby automatically updating,\nwe make sure that happens.\n\n354\n00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.540\nAll right, it's telling me here the\nsoftware updates are available right now.\n\n355\n00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.480\nI can show those updates.\n\n356\n00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.440\nIt'll just take me to the app store and\n\n357\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.980\nthen you have things like passwords,\nsettings.\n\n358\n00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.240\nThis is really not for updates.\n\n359\n00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.180\nThis is for doing in-app purchases and\n\n360\n00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.880\nall that so\nit doesn't really affect the updates.\n\n361\n00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.120\nBut the whole up part here,\n\n362\n00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.910\nthis top part is what is detecting and\ninstalling those updates.\n\n363\n00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:42.850\nAnd if I had that turned on, the updates\nwould be almost automatic, right?\n\n364\n00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.830\nThere's two times where the updates\nwon't automatically apply.\n\n365\n00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.260\nOne is the platform update.\n\n366\n00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.410\nSo when Sierra comes out,\nit's gonna download it.\n\n367\n00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.300\nIt's gonna even tell me,\nit'll be like, hey, Sierra is out.\n\n368\n00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.700\nWould you like to upgrade to Sierra?\n\n369\n00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.690\nIt gives you that chance,\n\n370\n00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:59.306\ncuz you might not be ready to jump\ninto this whole new version of the OS.\n\n371\n00:17:59.306 --> 00:18:01.870\nThe other updates it will automatically\ndo, but the big platform update,\n\n372\n00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.210\nit'll prompt you first right?\n\n373\n00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.220\nAnd then you just say yes,\nand it'll do it,\n\n374\n00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.830\nyou can even tell it to do it overnight.\n\n375\n00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.880\nThe other time is,\nsometimes there'll be an update to an app,\n\n376\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.810\nand the app has to be closed for\nthe update to run.\n\n377\n00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:17.980\nAnd if that happens, a little bubble\nwill pop up on the screen telling you it\n\n378\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.330\nhappened, so that you know\nhey you can close the app and\n\n379\n00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.440\nupdate it now or\nit'll update later on the next reboot.\n\n380\n00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.960\nSo, it's up to you when that happens.\n\n381\n00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.040\nThat's kind of the two scenarios where\nit doesn't automatically update,\n\n382\n00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.360\notherwise it's going to do it and that's\nreally what we do want to have set up.\n\n383\n00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Don, it's really interesting\nif you read security blogs of security\n\n384\n00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.330\nprofessionals and or you just listen\nto security and IT in general.\n\n385\n00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.650\nYou hear from those professionals.\n\n386\n00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:43.670\nWhen they're testing systems that one\nof the major problems that allows for\n\n387\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.910\nexploitation is because they don't have\na healthy patching regimen built in.\n\n388\n00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.190\nThat procedure that they're following.\n\n389\n00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.690\nAnd all it takes set up\nyour automatic updates.\n\n390\n00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.620\nMake sure that those are happening\non a regular and scheduled basis.\n\n391\n00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.748\nKeep yourself out of the weeds,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n392\n00:18:57.748 --> 00:19:02.173\nNow that being said, we have\nan interesting thing that you have Les and\n\n393\n00:19:02.173 --> 00:19:02.930\nI are list.\n\n394\n00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:07.750\nAnd this is when you start really\ngetting into I have multiple machines.\n\n395\n00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:08.792\nI need to set them up.\n\n396\n00:19:08.792 --> 00:19:10.970\nAnd I wanna make my life\na little bit easier.\n\n397\n00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:11.580\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n398\n00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.080\n&gt;&gt; When it comes into\nthe predefined profiles, right?\n\n399\n00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.760\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we just spent two and a half\nepisodes talking about all the different\n\n400\n00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.160\nlittle things we configure\non a brand new machine.\n\n401\n00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.170\nWell, if you have one machine,\nthat's fine.\n\n402\n00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.060\nYou run through it,\nyou get it set up the way you want.\n\n403\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.080\nBut if you've got a thousand machines?\n\n404\n00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.060\nIt's a nightmare.\n\n405\n00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.415\n&gt;&gt; Your life is horrible, now.\n\n406\n00:19:29.415 --> 00:19:31.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, unless you're an hourly employee.\n\n407\n00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:31.962\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, then it's great.\n[LAUGH]\n\n408\n00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:33.071\n&gt;&gt; You've got job security like crazy!\n\n409\n00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:35.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you're salaried, it stinks.\n\n410\n00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.606\nSo what we wanna do is, we wanna make\nit where it's easy to replicate these\n\n411\n00:19:38.606 --> 00:19:40.999\nconfigurations across\na large number of computers.\n\n412\n00:19:40.999 --> 00:19:43.943\nAnd Apple has two primary methods for\ndoing that.\n\n413\n00:19:43.943 --> 00:19:48.753\nAll right, one method is using a system\ncalled NetInstall, and NetInstall is where\n\n414\n00:19:48.753 --> 00:19:52.752\nyou build custom MacOS installers\nthat already have applications and\n\n415\n00:19:52.752 --> 00:19:56.360\nthings built into it, and\nit's ready to rock when you deploy.\n\n416\n00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.610\nThat's great for applications, but\nnot so great for carrying over settings.\n\n417\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:04.540\nOn the setting side they have\nsomething called the profile manager.\n\n418\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.920\nAnd I think I've mentioned the profile\nmanager in another episode.\n\n419\n00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.750\nBut the profile manager is a part\nof the OS 10 server app and\n\n420\n00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.980\nI know I've mentioned that one.\n\n421\n00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:12.975\nThe OS 10 Server app.\n\n422\n00:20:12.975 --> 00:20:16.689\nYou can go in the app store, it costs\na whopping $20 and when you install it,\n\n423\n00:20:16.689 --> 00:20:19.975\nit converts your Mac OS\nworkstation into a Mac OS server.\n\n424\n00:20:19.975 --> 00:20:23.795\nAnd one of the services it provides\nis the profile manager and\n\n425\n00:20:23.795 --> 00:20:27.387\nin the profile manager you can\ndefine all the settings and\n\n426\n00:20:27.387 --> 00:20:31.090\npolicies and restrictions and all\nthe things that you wanna put in place.\n\n427\n00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.940\nAnd you create a policy that can\nthen be applied to one machine,\n\n428\n00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.160\na hundred machines, a thousand machines.\n\n429\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.480\nAnd can automatically configure them the\nway that you want them to be configured.\n\n430\n00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.840\nAnd that is gonna save you a ton of time.\n\n431\n00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.900\nNow, for those of you that go on to do\nthe Apple Certified Technical Coordinator,\n\n432\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.990\nthe ACTC certification, I show exactly\nhow to set up the profile manager and\n\n433\n00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.960\nhow to deploy it on machines and how to\nbuild net install images and all of that,\n\n434\n00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.960\nwe cover all of that there.\n\n435\n00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.200\nSo it's not really on this exam but\n\n436\n00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.650\nI do wanna show it to you briefly\njust to give you an idea.\n\n437\n00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.810\nBecause even though it's not on the exam,\n\n438\n00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.770\nit is in real life and it's something-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n439\n00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.160\n&gt;&gt; That you'll want to use.\n\n440\n00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.140\nSo just to give you a quick run-through,\nI've got my server in the background here.\n\n441\n00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.510\nLet me just switch over to it.\n\n442\n00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:19.350\nAnd this is the server app, the $20 app\nthat you go and buy in the app store.\n\n443\n00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.120\nAnd you'll see it's got all these\ndifferent services here on the side.\n\n444\n00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.820\nAnd one of the services\nis the Profile Manager.\n\n445\n00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.660\nGetting the Profile Manager\nset up is really easy.\n\n446\n00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.620\nWhat you do is when you first fired up,\n\n447\n00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.730\nsee where mine says device\nmanagement enabled?\n\n448\n00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:33.820\nYours won't say that.\n\n449\n00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.160\nIt'll say device management and\nthen there'll be a configure button.\n\n450\n00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.910\nYou click that configure button and\nyou provide an Apple ID.\n\n451\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.530\nIt needs an Apple ID cuz it's\ngonna generate a certificate for\n\n452\n00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.548\nyour server to use for push configuration.\n\n453\n00:21:45.548 --> 00:21:48.510\nIf they were pushing a profile out to\nother machines, they have to trust us, so\n\n454\n00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.240\nit'll generate that certificate.\n\n455\n00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.790\nYou just log in and hit next, three times.\n\n456\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.620\nIt's not like a crazy ordeal.\n\n457\n00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.610\nApple issues you the cert and now you've\ngot it, the cert's good for two years,\n\n458\n00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:00.880\nI believe, and you don't have to\nworry about it for, well, two years.\n\n459\n00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.435\nAfter that, you hit the on button,\nand it's on, right?\n\n460\n00:22:04.435 --> 00:22:06.995\nAnd that's kind of it to get\nthe service up and running.\n\n461\n00:22:06.995 --> 00:22:09.245\nThere's a lot of other stuff here\nto tweak that some of you may need,\n\n462\n00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:12.525\nsome of you may not, but\nwe cover that in the other show.\n\n463\n00:22:12.525 --> 00:22:14.485\nBut after that,\nyou come down here to the bottom,\n\n464\n00:22:14.485 --> 00:22:17.255\nand you've got the Profile Manager, and\nyou can choose to open it in Safari.\n\n465\n00:22:17.255 --> 00:22:19.935\nIt is a web-based management screen.\n\n466\n00:22:19.935 --> 00:22:23.655\nAnd when you click on Open in Safari,\nyou'll be taken to this page right here.\n\n467\n00:22:23.655 --> 00:22:27.490\nThis is the profile manager's\nweb management screen.\n\n468\n00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:32.460\nAnd what you do is you come in and\nyou define your users or your devices.\n\n469\n00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.970\nSo I can manage things based on a\nparticular laptop or a particular desktop.\n\n470\n00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.200\nI can base it on a user.\n\n471\n00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.750\nThink about like.\n\n472\n00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.040\nIn another episode we're going and see\nthe Apple remote desktop utility and we do\n\n473\n00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.910\nthe same thing there where you can control\nall your laptops or all your desktops.\n\n474\n00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.400\nI want to control all my student machines,\nall my teacher machines,\n\n475\n00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.710\nyou think about how you want\nto manage things right, and\n\n476\n00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:57.650\nyou can come through and create device\ngroups that match up with your devices.\n\n477\n00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:03.160\nSo I might add a device group called\nsomething like corporate laptops.\n\n478\n00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.070\nAnd this is gonna contain\nthe default standard settings for\n\n479\n00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:11.420\nany laptop that I'm using,\nin my corporate environment, right?\n\n480\n00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:16.250\nAnd then I might create another one,\ncalled corporate desktops or whatever,\n\n481\n00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.220\nto meet my needs, right?\n\n482\n00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.825\nAnd, once I create the corporate laptops,\nI can go to the settings tab,\n\n483\n00:23:21.825 --> 00:23:24.100\nit'll actually you usually start here at\nthe about tab which is kind of pointless,\n\n484\n00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.430\nbut you go to the settings tab and\nit has the ability for\n\n485\n00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.210\nyou edit the settings for that device.\n\n486\n00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.720\nAnd if I go in and I edit it,\nit'll take me to this screen.\n\n487\n00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.080\nWhere we can see all the different\nsettings that can be customized.\n\n488\n00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.400\nAnd the Profile Manager can\nmanage not just Mac OS but\n\n489\n00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.460\nit can also do IOS and tvOS.\n\n490\n00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.950\nFor this exam we only care about\nMac OS but in real life land,\n\n491\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.260\nyou may have the others\nthat are out there too.\n\n492\n00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.410\nAnd as you look down, you'll see where\nwe can define the network configuration.\n\n493\n00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.370\nYou can actually set the SSID.\n\n494\n00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.790\nYou wanted to connect to so\nit's predefined.\n\n495\n00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:55.720\nAnd we don't have to do it.\n\n496\n00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.220\nSo I can go here under configure, and\nI can say, yeah, I wanna use WiFi.\n\n497\n00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.400\nI wanna connect to ITProTV guest.\n\n498\n00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.306\nAnd you can specify the other\nsecurity information.\n\n499\n00:24:06.306 --> 00:24:11.848\nI can say this one is actually WPA2 and\nit's got a key so here is the private key.\n\n500\n00:24:11.848 --> 00:24:16.210\nAnd now, it's defined right there, right?\n\n501\n00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.840\nThat was something I did as part\nof my initial configuration.\n\n502\n00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.710\nAs you continue looking down\nthe line you'll see things like VPN,\n\n503\n00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.490\nif you needed to find that.\n\n504\n00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.060\nSomewhere in here we've\ngot the app updates.\n\n505\n00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.450\nIt is divided by the operating systems,\nso there's some things I can set for\n\n506\n00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.770\nthe operating system if it's iOS.\n\n507\n00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.120\nSome things for Mac OS,\nsome things for all of them.\n\n508\n00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:39.440\nSo the section I was in there at the very\nbeginning was kind of all of them, right?\n\n509\n00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.850\nBut if I keep scrolling down, I'll find\nthe section that's focused just on Mac OS.\n\n510\n00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:45.290\nWhoops, I got a little scroll crazy.\n\n511\n00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.410\nThere it is.\n\n512\n00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.140\nAnd from here,\nwe'll see things like Security &amp; Privacy,\n\n513\n00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.250\nwhere I can tweak whether\nFile Vault is turned on by default.\n\n514\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.860\nI can bind it to a directory if I want\nit to join my Apple open directory, or\n\n515\n00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.620\na Microsoft Active Directory.\n\n516\n00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.120\nI can specify other things there.\n\n517\n00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.250\nAll the different things that we\ncustomize on a new computer, right?\n\n518\n00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.590\nAll the things that we've talked about.\n\n519\n00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.920\nLike software update.\n\n520\n00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.660\nI can get in here and\nI can configure that.\n\n521\n00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:12.630\nNow, by doing this,\nI think if I've set up an internal\n\n522\n00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.120\nMac update server that\nmanages I can point to it.\n\n523\n00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:20.310\nBy setting all this information up,\nI can do it all here in one place,\n\n524\n00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:25.205\nget everything set the way that I want,\nand then save this profile.\n\n525\n00:25:25.205 --> 00:25:29.935\nAnd when you save the profile, all of\nthose settings are collected together.\n\n526\n00:25:29.935 --> 00:25:32.995\nAnd if the machine is enrolled\nin my profile manager,\n\n527\n00:25:32.995 --> 00:25:34.245\nI can push the settings over the network.\n\n528\n00:25:34.245 --> 00:25:39.100\nBut if this is a brand new machine,\nI can just hit Download, and,\n\n529\n00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.900\ndid I pick something\nthat can't be downloaded.\n\n530\n00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.550\nThere are some things that\ncan't be downloaded and\n\n531\n00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:46.801\nI think I might have actually picked\none that won't support it, darn it.\n\n532\n00:25:46.801 --> 00:25:52.382\n[LAUGH] The settings that I defined\nare not right to allow it to download.\n\n533\n00:25:52.382 --> 00:25:53.700\nSo it's not going to let me.\n\n534\n00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.270\nBut, when you define these settings,\nyou can go in and you can download it.\n\n535\n00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.410\nAnd you'll download a simple file,\nyou can call it whatever you want.\n\n536\n00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:04.510\nSo, you know, corporate laptops But\nthe extension is .mobileconfig.\n\n537\n00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.740\nAnd so you'll have a file that\njust ends in .mobileconfig.\n\n538\n00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.710\nAnd you can save it to a USB Key.\n\n539\n00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:12.200\nYou can take it to any new machine and\njust double-click on the file, and\n\n540\n00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.190\nit will apply all of the settings\nthat you've defined here in the file.\n\n541\n00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:20.010\nAnd now you can push those out and\nquickly and easily roll it out.\n\n542\n00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.900\nIf you're doing it via\nthe network it's even easier.\n\n543\n00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.260\nYou just need a user account,\npassword on those machines and\n\n544\n00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.400\nyou can push it out to it.\n\n545\n00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.840\nA lot of people will build a net\ninstall image that already trusts\n\n546\n00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.060\nthe profile manager, so\nas soon as that machine comes up,\n\n547\n00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.240\nthe profile manager can just\npush the settings on it.\n\n548\n00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.970\nAnd all the stuff we talked\nabout in the last two and\n\n549\n00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.960\na half episodes can be applied like that.\n\n550\n00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.223\nAnd for each user that logs in on it,\nnot managed individually\n\n551\n00:26:43.223 --> 00:26:47.240\nby users if we don't want to, but\nyou can do it by user if you need to.\n\n552\n00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.670\nSo you've got that level of flexibility.\n\n553\n00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.450\nThe Profile Manager is very,\nvery powerful.\n\n554\n00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:53.900\nIt does take a little bit\nof doing to get it set up,\n\n555\n00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.180\nto get devices enrolled,\nto get it all working.\n\n556\n00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:01.470\nSo if you're interested in it, be sure to\njump over and check out our ACTC Show.\n\n557\n00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:06.410\nWe cover it there, but for this exam,\nyou don't have to know how\n\n558\n00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:10.720\nthe Profile Manager works, I just wanted\nyou to be familiar with it as an option,\n\n559\n00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.600\nbecause in real life land,\nit's a tool you will really appreciate.\n\n560\n00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.610\nThere's a handful of those.\n\n561\n00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.770\nAnd we'll talk about some\nothers later in this series.\n\n562\n00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:21.870\nApple Remote Desktop, the Profile Manager,\nyour own custom Windows update server,\n\n563\n00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.840\nthe OS 10 server app itself.\n\n564\n00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.845\nThey're all things that\nreally make managing Macs and\n\n565\n00:27:26.845 --> 00:27:28.880\nsupporting Macs like this a breeze.\n\n566\n00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.776\nIt really helps out in a corporate world,\nin a school world.\n\n567\n00:27:31.776 --> 00:27:34.550\nAt home, it's way overkill and\nit's a pain in the butt.\n\n568\n00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:36.257\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Right?\nBut for a corporate environment,\n\n569\n00:27:36.257 --> 00:27:38.430\nyou'll appreciate these\nthings every single day.\n\n570\n00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:42.796\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can't totally tell you that\nDon is preaching the gospel here.\n\n571\n00:27:42.796 --> 00:27:44.416\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When it comes,\n\n572\n00:27:44.416 --> 00:27:47.930\nbecause it is a lot of work on\nthe backend to set every little bell and\n\n573\n00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:51.230\nwhistle, and\ntick all the boxes and all that.\n\n574\n00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:54.880\nBut, in the long run it just saves\nyou a ton of time and effort and\n\n575\n00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.430\njust makes your life so much easier.\n\n576\n00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:59.010\nIt's totally worth getting that right,\ndoing it right the first time, and\n\n577\n00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:04.000\nthen just being able to deploy them\nout to new PCs that are new Macs,\n\n578\n00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.300\nas they hit your network.\n\n579\n00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:06.680\nVery, very nice stuff.\n\n580\n00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.180\nDon, it looks like we maybe\nhave covered everything.\n\n581\n00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.630\nIs there anything else you wanted\nto cover before we call it a show?\n\n582\n00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:12.620\n&gt;&gt; So, just so you guys know,\n\n583\n00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.100\nbecause while Daniel was talking,\nI figured it out.\n\n584\n00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.595\nI forgot to hit the save button.\n\n585\n00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:20.010\n&gt;&gt; Let me just show you real quick just\nin case, you know, you run into this.\n\n586\n00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.750\nWay down here at the bottom is\nthis little Save button and\n\n587\n00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:23.730\nI forgot to hit the Save button.\n\n588\n00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.600\nAnd once I hit Save,\nthen my Download button lights up and\n\n589\n00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.500\nnow I can go and I can download that file.\n\n590\n00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.796\nI want to download it for Mac OS.\n\n591\n00:28:29.796 --> 00:28:34.740\nAnd it's going to download, so\nit just went into my Downloads folder,\n\n592\n00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.235\nand I don't actually want to\ninstall it here on my server.\n\n593\n00:28:37.235 --> 00:28:41.789\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I want to install it on my client\n\n594\n00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:43.240\nmachine.\n\n595\n00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.460\nBut it downloads, and there it is.\n\n596\n00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.780\nHere's my settings for for\nCorporate_Laptop.mobileconfig.\n\n597\n00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.420\nIt's a whopping two kilobytes in size,\nso very small.\n\n598\n00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.380\nCuz it's really just a list of settings.\n\n599\n00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.260\nBut I can take that to any machine and\njust double-click on it.\n\n600\n00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.960\nAnd it'll ask them to trust\nthe certificate in it.\n\n601\n00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.410\nAnd once they trust it,\nthen it'll install the settings.\n\n602\n00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:00.020\nAnd you're good to go.\n\n603\n00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:03.078\nSo definitely a neat thing there,\nif you remember to hit Save.\n\n604\n00:29:03.078 --> 00:29:06.800\n&gt;&gt; Alright well ,Don, you've done a great\njob of taking us step by step through what\n\n605\n00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.940\nit takes to initially get a new Mac set\nup, or if you've reinstalled the operating\n\n606\n00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.910\nsystem, and you need to get\nback to full working order.\n\n607\n00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:15.900\nYou should have the tools and\ncapabilities,\n\n608\n00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.230\nin your pocket right now,\nto make that very thing happen.\n\n609\n00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:21.490\nIf not, you just review these\nthree little episodes here and\n\n610\n00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:22.930\nit should put you back in business.\n\n611\n00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:26.300\nThat being said looking at our clock and\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n612\n00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.410\nWe do thank you for watching.\n\n613\n00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.130\nDon, thanks for joining us as well.\n\n614\n00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:32.070\nSigning off for ITProTv,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n615\n00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.740\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n616\n00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.524\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n617\n00:29:34.524 --> 00:29:40.555\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n618\n00:29:40.555 --> 00:29:45.739\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV\n\n",

00:00:16.780\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.214\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are taking a look at our ACSP.\n\n8\n00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:25.167\nIf I can get that right, Apple\nCertified Support Professional series.\n\n9\n00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:28.867\nAnd joining us in the studio to lend\nhis knowledge on that topic for us,\n\n10\n00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:30.575\nour good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:31.360\nDon, welcome back sir.\n\n12\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.100\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.310\n&gt;&gt; It is going just well, Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.890\nReady to dive into managing\nuser accounts inside of macOS.\n\n15\n00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.334\nNow, managing user accounts is one of\nthose interesting topics cuz if you're\n\n16\n00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:43.112\na home user with a Mac you probably\ndon't have to do it, right?\n\n17\n00:00:43.112 --> 00:00:44.310\nMost of us don't.\n\n18\n00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.790\nBut in a business environment user\naccounts became very, very important.\n\n19\n00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.430\nSo, we're gonna take a look at some of\nthe user accounts that are available to be\n\n20\n00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.690\ncreated inside of OS 10.\n\n21\n00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.223\nHow they work, how we can create them and\nuse them, and what some of the differences\n\n22\n00:00:55.223 --> 00:00:58.285\nare, cuz there's a lot of options\nthat are commonly misunderstood.\n\n23\n00:00:58.285 --> 00:01:00.495\nSo that's what's coming up\non our plate for today.\n\n24\n00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:01.905\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo today we get to learn how to\n\n25\n00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:03.976\nsubjugate our users with an iron first.\n\n26\n00:01:03.976 --> 00:01:05.153\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n27\n00:01:05.153 --> 00:01:05.704\nThat's exactly what I've been waiting for.\n\n28\n00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:06.640\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n29\n00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.888\nWell, all right, so let's talk about that.\n\n30\n00:01:07.888 --> 00:01:10.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Reign down with an iron first.\n\n31\n00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:14.258\nWhen you first install macOS it asks\nyou to create a user account and\n\n32\n00:01:14.258 --> 00:01:17.406\nyou type in whose Mac it's gonna be and\nit renames the Mac.\n\n33\n00:01:17.406 --> 00:01:19.715\nSo for\nexample my laptop was originally called,\n\n34\n00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:23.376\nI think it was called Don's Macbook Pro\nbecause that's what it names it cuz it\n\n35\n00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:25.490\nasks you your name when you set it up.\n\n36\n00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.290\nAnd it does create one user account for\nyou at the initial set up.\n\n37\n00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.950\nAnd that user account is an administrator,\nright?\n\n38\n00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.210\nSo what does that mean?\n\n39\n00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.867\nWell it means that nobody's reigning\ndown on you with an iron fist, right?\n\n40\n00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:38.788\nYou can do whatever the heck\nyou want to do on the system.\n\n41\n00:01:38.788 --> 00:01:41.360\nYou're the administrator, right?\n\n42\n00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.050\nBut you might have other people you\nwant to use the computer as well and\n\n43\n00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.740\nyou don't want them to be administrators.\n\n44\n00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.606\nSo we've got to be able to step in and\n\n45\n00:01:49.606 --> 00:01:52.104\nrestrict those accounts a little bit,\nright?\n\n46\n00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:54.652\nAnd so there's a few different user\naccounts we can work with that allow\n\n47\n00:01:54.652 --> 00:01:55.800\nus to do that.\n\n48\n00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.750\nBefore I dive too deep into the details,\n\n49\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.615\nlet me show you the panel\nwhere we go to set this up.\n\n50\n00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:02.171\nWe'll kinda walk through the settings and\nfeatures as we see them.\n\n51\n00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:05.300\nSo on a Mac if you just go\ninto your system preferences.\n\n52\n00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.410\nSo I'm gonna go up here to my Apple\nmenu and go down to system preferences.\n\n53\n00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.040\nInside of system preferences,\nyou'll see users and groups.\n\n54\n00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.010\nNow if this your own device, right,\nso you just bought it for you and\n\n55\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.911\nyou set it up and it created an account\nfor you like mine right here,\n\n56\n00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:23.503\nDon Pezet Admin, then that's it, right?\n\n57\n00:02:23.503 --> 00:02:26.200\nYou never really come\nback to this panel again.\n\n58\n00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.880\nYou've got your one account and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n59\n00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.340\nBut, there's a number of things that\nwe'll do throughout the series of this\n\n60\n00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.570\ncourse where we'll actually\nunintentionally create things,\n\n61\n00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.520\nlike guest user accounts and\nother accounts that'll pop up.\n\n62\n00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.720\nSo that's what we're gonna see here.\n\n63\n00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.670\nOn a new Mac you'll probably see something\nvery similar to what I'm seeing here,\n\n64\n00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.150\nwhere you've got an account for\nyou, you'll be flagged as an admin,\n\n65\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.860\nthere'll be other users and\nthere'll be a guest account, okay?\n\n66\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.810\nAnd your guest account may or\nmay not be turned on, but it'll show up.\n\n67\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.930\nAnd that's usually about the extent of\nwhat you're gonna see on a new Mac.\n\n68\n00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.150\nBut the reality is, we can come in and\nstart to create a heck of a lot more here.\n\n69\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.800\nWhen we create user accounts\nthere's actually five\n\n70\n00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.020\ndifferent types of user\naccounts that can pop up.\n\n71\n00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.070\nWhat I'm seeing here are just two, right?\n\n72\n00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.650\nSo let's talk about these two,\nfirst up, admin.\n\n73\n00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.936\nAn admin can do anything,\nwell they can sort of do anything.\n\n74\n00:03:18.936 --> 00:03:23.370\nAn admin's actually a normal user by\ndefault, so I'm a normal user right now.\n\n75\n00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.560\nBut if I want to do something that\nrequires administrative privileges,\n\n76\n00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.870\nI'm allowed to, right?\n\n77\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.490\nSo for example,\nin order to make any changes here,\n\n78\n00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.540\nlike if I want to add a new user account,\nI can't.\n\n79\n00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.350\nI'm an admin, but I can't make the change.\n\n80\n00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.500\nWell, it's not that I can't.\n\n81\n00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.070\nIt's that I'm being protected.\n\n82\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.490\nThe software that I run as\nthe administrator is not run as\n\n83\n00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.640\nan administrator by default because\nI could accidentally run a virus, and\n\n84\n00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.460\nthen what would happen?\n\n85\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.870\nIt could run rampant all over my computer\ncuz it's an administrator too now, right?\n\n86\n00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.610\nBut if everything I run is as a regular\nuser then the virus runs as a regular user\n\n87\n00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.042\nand then it can't really\ndo a whole lot of damage.\n\n88\n00:03:57.042 --> 00:04:01.866\nSo I I'm acting like a normal user and\nI can do what's called elevating my\n\n89\n00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:06.374\nprivileges to bump up to full\nadministrative access when I need it,\n\n90\n00:04:06.374 --> 00:04:08.035\nonly when I need it.\n\n91\n00:04:08.035 --> 00:04:10.825\nWhen I launch Safari I don't\nneed to be an administrator.\n\n92\n00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:13.985\nBut if I want to add or remove users\nI need to be an administrator.\n\n93\n00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:18.320\nAnd I can see this panel is locked,\nand if I hit the unlock button,\n\n94\n00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.010\nnow I'm gonna move into the administrative\nmode, for this application.\n\n95\n00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.680\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, are we always gonna see some\nsort of lock symbol, that will let us know\n\n96\n00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.880\nthat we need to elevate our privileges,\nor is there differences?\n\n97\n00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.800\n&gt;&gt; So inside of System Preferences, yes,\n\n98\n00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.630\nyou're always going to\nsee a lock like this.\n\n99\n00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.660\nYou'll have to unlock it,\n\n100\n00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.630\nto make the changes that are required for\nyou to be an administrator, right?\n\n101\n00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.690\nIn other areas though, you might not.\n\n102\n00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.240\nFor example, you might download\na third-party application\n\n103\n00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.040\nthat just requires you to be\nan administrator to run it, right?\n\n104\n00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.700\nI think, let's see, do I have\nUNetbootin or one of those programs?\n\n105\n00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.670\nLike this one, there we go.\n\n106\n00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.940\nSo I just ran UNetbootin.\n\n107\n00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.044\nAnd what UNetbootin does,\n\n108\n00:04:56.044 --> 00:04:58.976\nit's a little software package that\nlets you create bootable USB keys.\n\n109\n00:04:58.976 --> 00:05:02.128\nWell in order for it to do its\njob it has to format the USB key,\n\n110\n00:05:02.128 --> 00:05:05.932\nand in order to format the USB key I\nneed to be an administrator, right?\n\n111\n00:05:05.932 --> 00:05:09.391\nIn order for it to have the block\nlevel access to that USB key, so\n\n112\n00:05:09.391 --> 00:05:12.523\nwhen I run it the first thing\nit does is it says osascript,\n\n113\n00:05:12.523 --> 00:05:16.140\nwhich is apparently what the developer\ncalled it on the back end.\n\n114\n00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.185\nThat's not a good name for it,\nbut wants to make changes.\n\n115\n00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.605\nEnter your password to allow this.\n\n116\n00:05:20.605 --> 00:05:25.425\nThis me telling UNetbootin that\nit's okay to run as administrator.\n\n117\n00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:28.705\nIf I cancel that, it's gonna run as\na regular user and it's gonna fail.\n\n118\n00:05:28.705 --> 00:05:30.085\nIt's not gonna be able to do its job.\n\n119\n00:05:30.085 --> 00:05:35.410\nBut if I provide my credentials and\nI punch those in, now it can run and\n\n120\n00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.838\nthe application launches\nconveniently in the background.\n\n121\n00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:39.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so\n\n122\n00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.690\nit launches and now I can go in and\nI can create bootable USB media, right?\n\n123\n00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.850\nI never saw the lock.\n\n124\n00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.010\nI just saw a prompt for it.\n\n125\n00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.560\nSo that's basically the way that works for\nan administrator.\n\n126\n00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.550\nIf I was a regular user I'd see the prompt\ntoo, but a regular user wouldn't be able\n\n127\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.360\nto put their username and password in,\nthey'd have to put the username and\n\n128\n00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.883\npassword of an administrator in,\nsomebody else.\n\n129\n00:05:56.883 --> 00:05:58.818\nThey'd have to call me and\nsay hey Don can you come by here and\n\n130\n00:05:58.818 --> 00:06:00.115\npunch in your credentials real quick.\n\n131\n00:06:00.115 --> 00:06:03.843\nAnd I could do that and it would just\nwork for that one application, all right?\n\n132\n00:06:03.843 --> 00:06:07.770\nSo in this case I do see the lock,\nI can punch in my credentials, and\n\n133\n00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.690\nnow I'm able to act as an administrator.\n\n134\n00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.830\nSo the administrators are the first type\nof user account that we encounter because\n\n135\n00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.610\nit's the one that's created by default\nas part of the setup when we install\n\n136\n00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.110\nmacOS, right?\n\n137\n00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.817\nThe second user account that we're\ngoing to see is the guest account.\n\n138\n00:06:22.817 --> 00:06:25.861\nThat's the other one that's\ncreated when we install macOS.\n\n139\n00:06:25.861 --> 00:06:30.682\nNow the guest account is somebody can\nlogin to your laptop or desktop or\n\n140\n00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:34.500\nwhatever without a username and\na password.\n\n141\n00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.760\nNow that sounds like\na phenomenally bad idea.\n\n142\n00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.910\nWhy would I want to allow\nsomebody to login to my computer\n\n143\n00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.650\nanonymously like that?\n\n144\n00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.127\nWell, there's a couple of\ndifferent reasons for it.\n\n145\n00:06:44.127 --> 00:06:48.418\nOne use case scenario is maybe you have\nsomebody visiting and you want them to use\n\n146\n00:06:48.418 --> 00:06:53.740\nyour computer, but you don't want to save\nall their documents and stuff like that.\n\n147\n00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.078\nThe guest account is a throwaway account.\n\n148\n00:06:55.078 --> 00:06:59.010\nSomebody can login, use your system,\nand when they're done they log out and\n\n149\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.650\nit was the guest user so all the data\njust gets deleted and it's gone and\n\n150\n00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:02.950\nyou don't have to worry about it, right?\n\n151\n00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.850\nSo it doesn't junk up your\nsystem with extra stuff.\n\n152\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.814\nThe other thing is as long as\nyou turned on file vault and\n\n153\n00:07:08.814 --> 00:07:11.588\nas long as you're using\npermissions on your disk,\n\n154\n00:07:11.588 --> 00:07:15.795\nwhen somebody logs in as a guest they have\nno way to be able to see your content.\n\n155\n00:07:15.795 --> 00:07:18.728\nThey can't see the data\nthat's in your home folder,\n\n156\n00:07:18.728 --> 00:07:21.630\nit's all isolated out,\nso your data is safe.\n\n157\n00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.510\nNow, they can use the computer, and\n\n158\n00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.500\nyou don't have to worry about\ncompromising your information, right?\n\n159\n00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.550\nBut there is another reason why\nwe might use guest access, and\n\n160\n00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.430\nthis one turns up on the exam sometimes,\nso it's important to know.\n\n161\n00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.721\nIf you turn on Find My Mac, right?\n\n162\n00:07:36.721 --> 00:07:39.220\nFind My Mac is an iCloud service.\n\n163\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.240\nAnd the idea is that if\nsomebody steals my laptop and\n\n164\n00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.470\nruns to the other side of the country and\ntries to sell it on eBay,\n\n165\n00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.700\nI should be able to find it and\nfind the Mac.\n\n166\n00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.900\n&gt;&gt; That's how you got that back.\n\n167\n00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.535\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n168\n00:07:50.535 --> 00:07:53.531\nSo but the thing is it works\nreally well on cellphones and\n\n169\n00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:56.038\ntablets that have cellular service, right?\n\n170\n00:07:56.038 --> 00:08:01.298\nWherever they go they got service, but\non a laptop I don't have cellular service.\n\n171\n00:08:01.298 --> 00:08:06.921\nSo somebody steals my laptop and runs off\nwith it and formats it and all that stuff.\n\n172\n00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:10.430\nHow's it's gonna connect back and\nlet me know that it's lost.\n\n173\n00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.610\nWell it's not until somebody\nconnects it to another network.\n\n174\n00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.830\nWhen it connects to another network\nthen it can falling home and\n\n175\n00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.570\nwe can figure out where it is and\npossibly recover it.\n\n176\n00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:24.410\nSo if you turned on Find My Mac it\nautomatically enables the guest account.\n\n177\n00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.110\nIt turns on that guest account.\n\n178\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:31.470\nAnd the hope is that somebody steals your\nlaptop and they don't know your passwords.\n\n179\n00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.395\nThey can't log in as you but they click on\nguest cuz they can log in there easily.\n\n180\n00:08:35.395 --> 00:08:38.980\nAnd they connect to a wireless network or\npotentially plugged in to a network.\n\n181\n00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.220\nAnd now the device phone home so\nyou can get it.\n\n182\n00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.250\nSo while you might not want\na guest user account turned on\n\n183\n00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.540\nit might turn itself on as part of\nenabling services like Find My Mac.\n\n184\n00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.790\nWe'll see that all throughout this course.\n\n185\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.790\nThere's various changes like that\nhappen when you turn one feature.\n\n186\n00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.290\nThey might seem unrelated at first but\nthey are actually related.\n\n187\n00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.280\nAll right, now if I don't want that guest\naccount though I can turn that off, right?\n\n188\n00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.520\nWhen I look at the Guest User,\n\n189\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.470\nI've got the option right here allow\nguests to log in to this computer.\n\n190\n00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.000\nI can just turn that off.\n\n191\n00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.350\nI don't want guests to\nbe able to connect and\n\n192\n00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.490\nallow guest users to connect\nto my shared folders.\n\n193\n00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.900\nHey, if I share something out,\n\n194\n00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.560\nI want somebody to provide a username and\na password.\n\n195\n00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.610\nI don't just anybody to get to it,\nso I can turn that off too, right.\n\n196\n00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.920\nSo we can disable those features and\nnow the guest user shows as off.\n\n197\n00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.870\nAnd if you just installed MacOS,\n\n198\n00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.770\nthat's actually what you'll\nsee the guest users off.\n\n199\n00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:30.430\nOnce you sign into iCloud and you turn\non Find My Mac, then it turns this on.\n\n200\n00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.180\nAnd that's the reason why it's trying\nto make it so that it can phone home.\n\n201\n00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.970\nAll right, so\nthere's two types of user accounts.\n\n202\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.190\nWhat are some of the other ones?\n\n203\n00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.410\nWell, there's the regular user account.\n\n204\n00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.350\nI hit my little plus sign down here,\nI'm gonna create an account and\n\n205\n00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.980\nwhen I go to create an account\nI've got this drop down box.\n\n206\n00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:52.480\nAnd in the drop down box I see four types\nof user accounts and groups are special.\n\n207\n00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.193\nSo what I'm seeing is administrator\nthat I already talked about.\n\n208\n00:09:55.193 --> 00:09:59.860\nAnd then we see Standard, Manged with\nParental Controls and Sharing Only.\n\n209\n00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.830\nThat's three more types of\nuser account right there.\n\n210\n00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.080\nWell Standard it's like the name implies,\na regular user.\n\n211\n00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.210\nThey're not an administrator.\n\n212\n00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.560\nThey can't make it administrative changes\non the system but they can login.\n\n213\n00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.620\nThey can work with the files and\ninstall applications and do some stuff.\n\n214\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.350\nThey can do whatever they need, right?\n\n215\n00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.910\nAnd that's a standard user.\n\n216\n00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.790\nSo if I want Daniel to be able to use\nmy laptop, I can come in here and\n\n217\n00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.340\ncreate him an account.\n\n218\n00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.010\nAnd set him a super secured password and\n\n219\n00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.030\nhint if I really wanna go crazy and\nthen I get that created.\n\n220\n00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.990\nAnd now Daniel's got a standard account,\nright.\n\n221\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:40.990\nI didn't make him an administrator so he\ncan't do things like unmount a hard drive.\n\n222\n00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.945\nOr install software that requires\nadministrative privileges but\n\n223\n00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:49.401\nhe can log in,\nhave his own files and folders.\n\n224\n00:10:49.401 --> 00:10:51.706\nHe can install apps from\nthe app store that are work.\n\n225\n00:10:51.706 --> 00:10:54.800\nHe can sign in to iCloud and\nuse the computer effectively.\n\n226\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.420\nAnd his data is kept separate\nfrom my data, right.\n\n227\n00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.270\nEvery user has a home folder.\n\n228\n00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.710\nAnd the home folder is protected.\n\n229\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.945\nSo he hasn't logged in yet,\nI'll log in as him in a minute and\n\n230\n00:11:05.945 --> 00:11:08.431\nit'll create that folder\nat the first log in.\n\n231\n00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:10.269\nSo he's got his data and it's ready to go.\n\n232\n00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:12.120\nWe'll take a look at that in a minute.\n\n233\n00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.100\nAlright, so that's a standard user.\n\n234\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:19.210\nThe other type of user that we\nsaw was a standard, well no,\n\n235\n00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:22.840\ntechnically standard but\na managed with parental controls, okay?\n\n236\n00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.260\nManaged with Parental Controls\nis actually a Standard user.\n\n237\n00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.944\nIt's a Standard user that just\nhas Parental Controls turned on.\n\n238\n00:11:27.944 --> 00:11:29.910\nAnd what are Parental Controls?\n\n239\n00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.260\nWell like the name implies,\n\n240\n00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.090\nit's designed for parent to control\naccess for the kid we have.\n\n241\n00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.030\nSo if I want to restrict\naccess to certain web pages.\n\n242\n00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.700\nIf I wanna restrict the amount of\ntime that somebody is allowed to use\n\n243\n00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.700\nthe computer.\n\n244\n00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.738\nIf I want to restrict what\napplication that are allowed to run.\n\n245\n00:11:43.738 --> 00:11:49.047\nThose are all things that I can do with\nparental controls if we turn it on.\n\n246\n00:11:49.047 --> 00:11:51.658\nAnd you don't want to turn it on for\nyourself, for your administrator account.\n\n247\n00:11:51.658 --> 00:11:55.100\nBecause then you can well you can lock\nyourself out and all sorts of bad things.\n\n248\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.570\nBut if you've got a kid that's\ngonna be using the system,\n\n249\n00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.030\nor maybe not a kid maybe it's a grown up.\n\n250\n00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.073\nBut you just need make sure you control\nthat access you can make use of that.\n\n251\n00:12:04.073 --> 00:12:04.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Listen,\n\n252\n00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.820\nI know some adults that love to\nget themselves into trouble and\n\n253\n00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.990\nthen they're like hey can\nyou come fix my computer?\n\n254\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.080\nI'm like here we go again.\n\n255\n00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.073\nYeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Time to\nput on the training wheels.\n\n256\n00:12:11.073 --> 00:12:12.205\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n257\n00:12:12.205 --> 00:12:13.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n258\n00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:18.090\nwell a managed with parental controls\nuser is actually just a standard user.\n\n259\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.219\nSo you can convert a standard user to\na managed with parental controls and\n\n260\n00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:22.307\nyou can go the other way.\n\n261\n00:12:22.307 --> 00:12:25.679\nYou can convert managed with parental\ncontrols back to a standard user because\n\n262\n00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:28.310\nit's just whether or\nnot you turn on those controls.\n\n263\n00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.360\nSo this option here in the drop-down box\nis really just saying whether I want those\n\n264\n00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.080\ncontrols turned on by default right.\n\n265\n00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.590\nSo if I choose that I'll\nsee the creation processes\n\n266\n00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.980\nalmost identical on what we have a moment\nago when I create in Daniel's account,\n\n267\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.270\nthe only difference is it's asking for\nan age.\n\n268\n00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:49.225\nAnd the age you'll notice is broken\nthem into four right, 4+, 9+ 12+ and\n\n269\n00:12:49.225 --> 00:12:53.780\n17+ these are designed to line\nup the ratings in App Store.\n\n270\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.370\nEvery app installed in the app store\nhas to have an age rating set to it.\n\n271\n00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:58.920\nIt's appropriate for four and up.\n\n272\n00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.526\nIt's appropriate for nine and\nup, 12 and up, or 17 and up.\n\n273\n00:13:01.526 --> 00:13:05.746\n17 and up is pretty much anything except\nfor the mature adult which Apple doesn't\n\n274\n00:13:05.746 --> 00:13:08.350\nactually doesn't allow in\nthe app store anyways.\n\n275\n00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.080\nSo this is for\nall intensive purposed the highest level.\n\n276\n00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:16.689\nAnd below is this four and that's gonna\nbasically what you've done to your tiger.\n\n277\n00:13:16.689 --> 00:13:21.070\n[LAUGH] That's it but you can kinda\ncount tail of what that access is.\n\n278\n00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.550\nThe same thing applies to website\nexcept most website have not\n\n279\n00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.210\ngone through the process\nto wait themselves.\n\n280\n00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.110\nSo it's not terribly\naffected on website but\n\n281\n00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.530\nit's really effected in the up store\nit does a good job with that, right.\n\n282\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.808\nBut after that everything\nelse here is the same.\n\n283\n00:13:33.808 --> 00:13:36.634\nAnd if I were to go back to Daniel's\naccount that we already created,\n\n284\n00:13:36.634 --> 00:13:39.480\nhere's Daniel's account and\nso it shows us Standard.\n\n285\n00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.940\nAnd right down here we can see\nenable parental controls and\n\n286\n00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.730\nthen I can open up the controls\nto get him set-up.\n\n287\n00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.050\nIf I choose to enable\nthe parental controls,\n\n288\n00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.950\nnotice what happened to his name up\nhere doesn't say standard anymore.\n\n289\n00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.035\nNow it says managed.\n\n290\n00:13:53.035 --> 00:13:54.920\nHe's now managed with parental controls.\n\n291\n00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.970\nRemember I said you could convert back and\nforth?\n\n292\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:57.940\nThat's how you do it.\n\n293\n00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.222\nOne whole check mark and\nwe go back and forth.\n\n294\n00:14:00.222 --> 00:14:02.292\nSo- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; What would happen if you did allow user\n\n295\n00:14:02.292 --> 00:14:04.592\nto administer this computer and managed?\n\n296\n00:14:04.592 --> 00:14:06.344\nIs it like a paradox and thing on itself?\n\n297\n00:14:06.344 --> 00:14:07.455\n&gt;&gt; They actually doesn't like that.\n\n298\n00:14:07.455 --> 00:14:08.836\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So when I check it,\n\n299\n00:14:08.836 --> 00:14:10.500\nsee how here it's warning me?\n\n300\n00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.570\nIt's saying are you\nsure you wanna do that?\n\n301\n00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.372\nThe user account has parental\ncontrols turned on, right?\n\n302\n00:14:14.372 --> 00:14:17.420\nSo it warns us that you're\nabout to do something dumb.\n\n303\n00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Enough to rip a hole\nin the space time continuum.\n\n304\n00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.200\n&gt;&gt; And if I say yes to it it makes them an\nadmin and it turns off parental controls.\n\n305\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.390\nAnd if I try to turn parental controls\nback on, it's just gonna warn me that it's\n\n306\n00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:33.190\ngonna take that and turn it on but\nthey're an admin also.\n\n307\n00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.700\nSo what happens is your account now\nwill have parental controls but\n\n308\n00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.140\nyou could log in and\njust turn them off like you're an admin.\n\n309\n00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.360\nSo you could go into the system\npreferences and turn it off.\n\n310\n00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.639\nSo it's not a usual scenario.\n\n311\n00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:49.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But you actually can make it happen.\n\n312\n00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.670\nSo I'm gonna turn off the administrative\naccess leave you with parental controls.\n\n313\n00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.930\nThere we go, all right.\n\n314\n00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.560\nSo now he's back to just Managed.\n\n315\n00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.680\nIt did give me a little warning there,\ncleared it really fast,\n\n316\n00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.540\nI shouldn't have done that,\nabout how I need to restart, right?\n\n317\n00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.040\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n318\n00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.900\n&gt;&gt; And that's because there were certain\npermissions put in place on Daniel's home\n\n319\n00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.150\nfolder that need to be reset now that I\nmessed with his administrator privileges,\n\n320\n00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.530\nso\n&gt;&gt; There are some changes,\n\n321\n00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:10.240\nthen they require that.\n\n322\n00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.700\nMost of these don't require a reboot or\nanything like that.\n\n323\n00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.680\nIf the user's already logged\nin they might have to log out,\n\n324\n00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.140\nlog back in as is typically the limit.\n\n325\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.460\nAll right, so parental controls, we're\ngonna talk about later in another episode.\n\n326\n00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.060\nBut just to really quick review them.\n\n327\n00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.264\nIf I hit open parental controls,\nIt's gonna take me to the Parental Control\n\n328\n00:15:26.264 --> 00:15:28.126\nscreen where I need to\nbe an administrator.\n\n329\n00:15:28.126 --> 00:15:30.560\nLet me provide my credentials.\n\n330\n00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.650\nAnd now in here you'll see some\nof the things that we can limit.\n\n331\n00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.730\nRemember I mentioned apps that they\ncould run, websites they can get to.\n\n332\n00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:40.980\nWe can be very specific and\nput just a couple of websites if we want.\n\n333\n00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.410\nStores that are allowed, time, privacy.\n\n334\n00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.948\nThese are all sorts of settings that\nwe can dictate based on what access.\n\n335\n00:15:46.948 --> 00:15:49.920\nOr that user to have it and again we will\ntake a look at this in another episode.\n\n336\n00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.617\nAll right at this point we've seen four\nuser accounts, we've seen administrators.\n\n337\n00:15:55.617 --> 00:16:01.730\nStandard users, manage your parental\ncontrols and the guest account, okay?\n\n338\n00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.830\nBut there is another\ntype of user account and\n\n339\n00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:09.880\nthat is the Sharing Only account, okay?\n\n340\n00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:15.630\nA Sharing Only account is a special\naccount, it's design for network access.\n\n341\n00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.938\nLet's say I have a folder here on my Mac\nand I share it out on the network, right?\n\n342\n00:16:18.938 --> 00:16:21.850\nSo, I wanna share this folder so\nother people can get to it.\n\n343\n00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.870\nBut I don't want just anybody to get into.\n\n344\n00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.670\nI wanna set permissions on it, right?\n\n345\n00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.660\nWhen people connect they've got to\nprovide a user name and a password.\n\n346\n00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.840\nWell, in the past what we have to do is\nactually create a user account for them.\n\n347\n00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.390\nSo, if I wanna share a folder and\nlet Daniel have access to it, right?\n\n348\n00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.380\nWell, I would need to\ncreate an account for him.\n\n349\n00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.400\nAnd if I created an account for\n\n350\n00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.200\nDaniel, that means that he could walk\nup to this computer and log in to it.\n\n351\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.940\nHe could log in physically to the machine,\nbut maybe I don't want that.\n\n352\n00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.800\nI wanna share a folder.\n\n353\n00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.380\nI want him to be able to access\nit from his own computer, but\n\n354\n00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.620\nI don't want him to come and\nsit down at my laptop and use it.\n\n355\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.120\nSo instead of giving him\na full blown user account,\n\n356\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.340\nI can give him a sharing only account.\n\n357\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:06.390\nA sharing only account will allow him to\naccess my folders via the network, but\n\n358\n00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.820\nnot sit down right in\nfront of the machine.\n\n359\n00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:10.970\nSo let me show you what it looks like.\n\n360\n00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:14.490\nSo I've got Daniel's account\nhere which is managed I guess.\n\n361\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:15.799\nI'll turn off your parental control.\n\n362\n00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:17.538\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; So it can give me a break on this one.\n\n363\n00:17:17.538 --> 00:17:19.770\nAnd I'm gonna create another user here.\n\n364\n00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.548\nAnd I'm gonna make this one Sharing Only,\nokay?\n\n365\n00:17:22.548 --> 00:17:25.170\nAnd we'll create one for\ngood old Christopher Walken.\n\n366\n00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.436\nHe'll swing by the studios,\none of these days.\n\n367\n00:17:26.436 --> 00:17:28.553\n&gt;&gt; He usually does.\n\n368\n00:17:28.553 --> 00:17:30.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we'll give him a account.\n\n369\n00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.120\nAnd I'm making this only Sharing Only.\n\n370\n00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.540\nOkay, so I'll create that user,\nand it'll appear right there.\n\n371\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.820\nThere we go.\nSo,\n\n372\n00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.360\nhe shows up right beneath Daniel, there.\n\n373\n00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.190\nI mean, they basically look the same,\nas far as account.\n\n374\n00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.990\nExcept when I right-click on Daniel,\nI've got the option to make him\n\n375\n00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.350\nan administrator or\nturn on parental controls.\n\n376\n00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.000\nWhen I choose Christopher Walken,\nI don't have any options, right?\n\n377\n00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.870\nBecause he can't be an administrator,\nhe's sharing only.\n\n378\n00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.150\nAnd I can't turn up parental controls,\n\n379\n00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.300\ncuz he can't even login in\nthe first place, right?\n\n380\n00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.660\nAnd I also can't convert it.\n\n381\n00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.960\nI can't convert him into a standard user.\n\n382\n00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:09.120\nHe's just going to be a sharing user and\nthat's the end of it, right?\n\n383\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.460\nNow, let me go and\ncreate a folder real quick.\n\n384\n00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.360\nSo I'll just create a folder called, but\n\n385\n00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.610\nactually others reused this folder I've\ngot on my desktop, where multi purpose, so\n\n386\n00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.700\nI've got a folder on my desktop with\nsome a Podcast files in it, right?\n\n387\n00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.950\nSo I'll take that folder and\nright now if I come in and\n\n388\n00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:29.800\ntake a look at the folder and I go down\ninto this Sharing and Permission on it.\n\n389\n00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.980\nI'll see that I have access\nto it cuz I made it.\n\n390\n00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.290\nAnd I can see the staff has Read only.\n\n391\n00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.030\nNow staff is anybody who has\na user account on this computer.\n\n392\n00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.850\nSo Daniel would have read\nonly access to this folder.\n\n393\n00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:44.750\nAnd then everyone also has Read\nonly access to the folder.\n\n394\n00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.819\nSo that's the folder as\nit's defined right now.\n\n395\n00:18:46.819 --> 00:18:49.810\nIt's just a regular old folder\non my hard drive, all right?\n\n396\n00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.720\nNow, if I go in System Preferences and\n\n397\n00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.128\nI go in to Sharing,\nI can share that folder out.\n\n398\n00:18:55.128 --> 00:19:00.961\nSo, I'm gonna add that folder here to my\nlist and share out the podcast folder.\n\n399\n00:19:00.961 --> 00:19:04.320\nAnd when I share it out,\nI don't want everyone to have access.\n\n400\n00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.030\nSo, I'm gonna come in say\nno access to everyone.\n\n401\n00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.780\nIn fact, I might even take staff.\n\n402\n00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.080\nAnd it won't let me make\nthat one no access, forgot.\n\n403\n00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.040\nIf you have a user account her\nit's gotta be part of staff, but\n\n404\n00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:19.840\nI can add in Daniel and\nI can add in Christopher Walken.\n\n405\n00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.628\nAnd so, I can add both of them to the list\nand maybe Daniel I want him to have read\n\n406\n00:19:24.628 --> 00:19:28.890\nand write and I want Christopher Walken\nto have read and write.\n\n407\n00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.270\nAs far as the share permissions\nare concerned they're treated equally.\n\n408\n00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.590\nAlright, so both of them will be able\nto access his folder view and network.\n\n409\n00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.410\nOn their computer they can fire up\ntheir finder, browse the network,\n\n410\n00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.400\nfind my laptop.\n\n411\n00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.930\nThey would see the podcast folder,\nand they would both have read and\n\n412\n00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.640\nwrite, after they provide\ntheir username and password.\n\n413\n00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.390\nThey'd have to authenticate to connect,\nwhere its different though?\n\n414\n00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:53.199\nSo now, I've got that setup,\nis if I log out, right?\n\n415\n00:19:53.199 --> 00:19:55.330\nSo let me log out as me.\n\n416\n00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.160\nWhen I log out and get to my log on\nscreen, which I will get to shortly.\n\n417\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.950\nWhen I get to the login screen, we see\nthe little bubbles that show all the user\n\n418\n00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.740\naccounts that are available for us, right?\n\n419\n00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.150\nAnd when I see the user accounts\nthat show up here, look who we see?\n\n420\n00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.690\nWell, sorry, it's a little small.\n\n421\n00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:18.550\nI can't zoom in my accessibility options\ndon't work on the login screen, but\n\n422\n00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.390\nyou've got me,\nthere's my little, tiny picture.\n\n423\n00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.270\nAnd then you've got Daniel Lowry,\nhe's a baseball.\n\n424\n00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.300\nAnd then where's Christopher Walken,\nright?\n\n425\n00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.460\n&gt;&gt; Nowhere to be found.\n\n426\n00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.990\n&gt;&gt; Right, he cannot log in,\nhere at the login screen.\n\n427\n00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.220\nThat's because you can only\naccess it via the network.\n\n428\n00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:35.150\nThis is a great way to ensure the privacy\nof your physical machine, but\n\n429\n00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.080\nstill give people network access.\n\n430\n00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.130\nI could have created a regular\nnetwork account for Christopher.\n\n431\n00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.750\nBut I didn't,\nI created a sharing account, and\n\n432\n00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:47.840\nthen by doing that he's now able to access\nthe network and not log in right here.\n\n433\n00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.090\n&gt;&gt; So it just kind of takes on the role\nof a file server at this point.\n\n434\n00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nbasically I'm acting as a file server and\n\n435\n00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.250\nI don't have to worry about all\nthese user accounts right here.\n\n436\n00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.480\nNow, the other thing it does is by\nmaking him a sharing account since he\n\n437\n00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.600\ncan't log in locally he\ndoesn't have a user profile.\n\n438\n00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.390\nI mentioned user profiles a minute ago.\n\n439\n00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:07.410\nLet me log in as Daniel, that's\na new account, he's never logged in.\n\n440\n00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.830\nAnd so the first time he logs in is\nactually creating a home directory for\n\n441\n00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.850\nhim and a profile.\n\n442\n00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.820\nAnd the profile contain things like\nall the stuff on his desktop, and\n\n443\n00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:20.460\nhis documents folder and all the other\nvarious things that make up his account.\n\n444\n00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.350\nIf he logs in with iTunes that\nwould be part of his account,\n\n445\n00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:29.220\nI'm not going to and all that it\nwill just be kind of part of it.\n\n446\n00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.520\nWell, all the things stored on the disk.\n\n447\n00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.990\nSo, as I move forward,\nit's creating and storing in my drive.\n\n448\n00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.590\nDaniel's now got his own little\nprivate space in my computer.\n\n449\n00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.880\nAnd he can't get to mine, right?\n\n450\n00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.420\nHe can login, he can see things,\nbut he can't get to my data.\n\n451\n00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.200\nNow, I still have my account and\n\n452\n00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.500\nI'm gonna use my fast user switching menu\nhere to jump back over to my account.\n\n453\n00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.480\nAnd when I log in I don't\nsee his stuff either.\n\n454\n00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.630\nHis stuff is separate from me.\n\n455\n00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.030\nBut I'm an administrator.\n\n456\n00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:02.470\nAnd as an administrator you can override\nthat and gain access to it if you need to.\n\n457\n00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:07.040\nSo for example, if I want to see his home\ndirectory it's right on the hard drive.\n\n458\n00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.320\nIf you browse into the hard drive\nthere's a folder called Users.\n\n459\n00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.960\nAnd when you go into Users, you'll see\na folder for each user that's out there.\n\n460\n00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.300\nYours will have a nice,\nlittle picture of a house, right?\n\n461\n00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.153\nThat's your Home folder,\nyou have permissions,\n\n462\n00:22:19.153 --> 00:22:20.541\nyou can do whatever you want in there.\n\n463\n00:22:20.541 --> 00:22:24.720\nYou can browse into it, and\nthere's your Home folder.\n\n464\n00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.440\nBut other users like Daniel Well\n\n465\n00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.720\nif you're not an administrator you will\nnot be able to get into that folder.\n\n466\n00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.770\nBut if you are an administrator\nyou'll be able to go in.\n\n467\n00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.690\nActually I should clarify that, even if\nyou're not an administrator you can get\n\n468\n00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.920\nin, but\nsee all these little red circles, right?\n\n469\n00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.590\nI can get into Daniels folder\nbecause of the public folder.\n\n470\n00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.320\nThe public folders available to everybody,\nright?\n\n471\n00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.730\nIf Daniel wants to make\nsomething available to\n\n472\n00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.470\neverybody he puts in the public folder.\n\n473\n00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:51.680\nThen everybody can see it.\n\n474\n00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.090\n&gt;&gt; Hence the term public.\n\n475\n00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.055\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's a good name.\n\n476\n00:22:55.055 --> 00:22:55.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n477\n00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.370\nthat's why we have to have permission just\nto be able to navigate in there, okay?\n\n478\n00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.690\nBut in the mean time,\nhis other stuff, like his desktop and\n\n479\n00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.920\nhis documents, those are protected.\n\n480\n00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.410\nAnd a regular user will not be\nable to navigate into there.\n\n481\n00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.790\nAnd the administrator like me though,\nif I try and\n\n482\n00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.650\nnavigate in, iisues gonna warn me\nthat I don't have permissions.\n\n483\n00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.164\nAnd I can always go and\noverride the permissions, right?\n\n484\n00:23:16.164 --> 00:23:19.116\nWe can do a Command I or Get Info.\n\n485\n00:23:19.116 --> 00:23:21.000\nWe can come in and\nstart messing with the permissions.\n\n486\n00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.909\nSo all we have to do is unlock it and\nnow we can override that, right?\n\n487\n00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:29.041\nBut one security concern that you do want\nto be aware of here is that I was able to\n\n488\n00:23:29.041 --> 00:23:31.730\nnavigate into his home folder, right?\n\n489\n00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:33.780\nIf Daniel is saving his document and\n\n490\n00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.900\nputting them inside of the document's\nfolder, inside of the desktop.\n\n491\n00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.700\nThen, I'm not gonna see them,\nI won't have any access.\n\n492\n00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.510\nBut what if he start saving things\nin the D Lowrie folder, right?\n\n493\n00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:45.964\nIf he just start saving\nit in /user/dlowery.\n\n494\n00:23:45.964 --> 00:23:47.900\nWell, I would see those documents here,\n\n495\n00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.788\nI wouldn't necessarily have access to open\nthem if you set the permissions right.\n\n496\n00:23:51.788 --> 00:23:56.211\nBut the default permissions\nare staff has read, right?\n\n497\n00:23:56.211 --> 00:23:59.702\nWhich means, sorry,\nstaff has read not read and write,\n\n498\n00:23:59.702 --> 00:24:02.120\nI was using right as acknowledgement.\n\n499\n00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.055\nSo staff has read, correct?\n\n500\n00:24:04.055 --> 00:24:08.050\n[LAUGH] So if he's dropping\ndocuments in his home folder,\n\n501\n00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:10.310\nI'll actually go to open them and\nlook at them,\n\n502\n00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.790\nunless he puts them in his documents\nfolder and then they're protected.\n\n503\n00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:19.350\nSo be aware of that the entire home\nfolder is not as safe as we might think,\n\n504\n00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:22.560\nat first glance, if we're not storing\ndocuments in the right place,\n\n505\n00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.500\nif we're putting things in the wrong area.\n\n506\n00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.900\n&gt;&gt; Now Don,\nyou said there were five user types.\n\n507\n00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.180\nWell, last time I was doing the math,\nthat's only four.\n\n508\n00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.150\nWhat's this fifth guy?\n\n509\n00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.198\n&gt;&gt; All right, so there's a,\nkind of an unofficial fifth one.\n\n510\n00:24:34.198 --> 00:24:36.390\nTechnically there's like seven\nclasses of users, right.\n\n511\n00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.010\nSo if you really wanna go crazy on this-\n&gt;&gt; Stretch it out here.\n\n512\n00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:41.910\n&gt;&gt; So go beyond what's on the exam but\non the exam you'll see five.\n\n513\n00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:45.400\nSo there's administrators,\nthere's standard users, there's management\n\n514\n00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:50.240\nparental controls, there's sharing only,\nand then there is guests, right?\n\n515\n00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.380\nSo that's kind of our five that we've got.\n\n516\n00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.220\nBut it really goes up to seven,\nbecause there's groups, and\n\n517\n00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:01.330\nin the Unix world groups are technically\na user but they contain other users.\n\n518\n00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.350\nIf I want to give\npermissions to five people,\n\n519\n00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:04.700\nI don't want to have to do it five times.\n\n520\n00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.780\nI can create one group,\nput the five people in the group and\n\n521\n00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.090\njust give them permissions to the group.\n\n522\n00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:09.830\nYou do it one time.\n\n523\n00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.730\nIt makes things easier to manage.\n\n524\n00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.730\nGroups aren't really required.\n\n525\n00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:14.970\nAnd in a small environment,\n\n526\n00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.000\nthey're typically more trouble\nthan they're worth, right?\n\n527\n00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.570\nBecause you have to go through the process\nof creating and managing them.\n\n528\n00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:20.800\nBut a large enterprise,\n\n529\n00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.780\na corporate environment, you really\nwant to leverage those to save you time.\n\n530\n00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.650\nRight?\nSo that's kind of number six.\n\n531\n00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.840\nAnd then we get to number seven,\nwhich is the root user.\n\n532\n00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.480\nThe root user is really special.\n\n533\n00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.520\nSo special that we haven't seen it yet\nanywhere.\n\n534\n00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:40.120\nThe root user is a protected account\nthat's created when Mac OS is installed.\n\n535\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.970\nAnd the root user can\ndo whatever they want.\n\n536\n00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:48.070\nThey have full, total control of\nevery aspect of the system And\n\n537\n00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.250\nthere's no limit to what they can do.\n\n538\n00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.070\nWe don't normally see\nthe rude user account.\n\n539\n00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.610\nTypically the only time we see it pop its\nhead up, is when we're in the terminal.\n\n540\n00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:00.940\nSo for example if I dropped to\nmy terminal, and I want to,\n\n541\n00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.960\nI wanna run some command, right?\n\n542\n00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.486\nSo maybe I have a USB key popped in\nmy system, let me plug in my USB key.\n\n543\n00:26:08.486 --> 00:26:13.810\nAnd, [COUGH]\nI want to take a look at that.\n\n544\n00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.600\nIt's a Sierra Installer.\n\n545\n00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:21.520\nSo if I look inside of /volumes, I can\nsee it now in this install macOS Sierra.\n\n546\n00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:27.930\nSo if I want to issue a Unix command like\numount /Volumes/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra/.\n\n547\n00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:29.970\nI'm gonna unmount that Right?\n\n548\n00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.560\nOperation not permitted,\nI'm not allowed to do it.\n\n549\n00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:38.270\nBut if I do a sudo before it,\nsuper user do.\n\n550\n00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:41.010\nI wanna do this command as a super user.\n\n551\n00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.860\nSomebody who has more privileges.\n\n552\n00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:46.780\nAnd now I can run it and\nit prompts me for a password and\n\n553\n00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.430\nI elevate my privileges and\nthen it goes to unmount it.\n\n554\n00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:52.100\nWell, resource is busy.\n\n555\n00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.440\nSo, the disk utility's\napparently locked it.\n\n556\n00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.680\nSo I can still do it\nfrom the disk utility.\n\n557\n00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:01.190\nAnd if I come in with disk utility and\nsay unmount, then it's gonna,\n\n558\n00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:05.270\nI have to tell it what I'm unmounting.\n\n559\n00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.810\nSo unmounting it doesn't really matter.\n\n560\n00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:13.190\nThe point is that I didn't have\npermission to use the umount command but\n\n561\n00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:14.610\nsuper user did.\n\n562\n00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.220\nWho is that super user, right?\n\n563\n00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:20.980\nWell if we run the whoami command,\nit'll show you who you're logged in as.\n\n564\n00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.950\nI'm logged in as depezet, right?\n\n565\n00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.720\nSo that's who I am, great.\n\n566\n00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:31.320\nBut if I do sudo whoami And\nI run that, I'm root.\n\n567\n00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.470\nThat root user that's\nhiding in the background,\n\n568\n00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:39.170\nwhen I use the sudu command I'm\nbecoming the root user right.\n\n569\n00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.710\nThat's how I have that full\naccess to be able to use them.\n\n570\n00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:43.250\nThat's what the administrator\nis allowed to do.\n\n571\n00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:47.020\nThe administrator is allowed to do execute\nthings as root which is really dangerous.\n\n572\n00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.100\nBecause root has no limits.\n\n573\n00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:53.090\nYou can do whatever the heck it wants and\nI mean you can go really crazy like if you\n\n574\n00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:56.470\ndo a pseudo dash s you'll\ncreate a shell and\n\n575\n00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:00.180\nnow everything you run is\nbeing run as that root user.\n\n576\n00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.480\nSo I don't even have to do pseudo\nanymore now I can run who am I or\n\n577\n00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.090\nI can try you mount something like that.\n\n578\n00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:11.220\nAnd it doesnt give me a operation or\npermitted each tells me just detail.\n\n579\n00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:11.850\nAnd so, so\n\n580\n00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:16.210\nnow I can do this things in everything I'm\nrunning is being run as the root user.\n\n581\n00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.990\nAnd then if I exist out of that shell and\n\n582\n00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:22.070\ndo who am I,\nI'm back to being Don Pezet, right?\n\n583\n00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.910\nSo that's the seventh user that\nseventh account type that exists\n\n584\n00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.370\nit you can't really mess with this\naccount, you can't change its password,\n\n585\n00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:33.170\nyou cant log in to the system as\nthat user you just elevate to it.\n\n586\n00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:33.850\nAll right, well Don,\n\n587\n00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:37.230\nthat was a very interesting little walk\ndown the different types of users that we\n\n588\n00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:40.990\nhave inside of our systems that\nwe may need to be familiar with.\n\n589\n00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.530\nA, to pass an exam or if you're going to\nbe an administrator of these types of\n\n590\n00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.830\nsystems, you have to be able\nto work with these things so\n\n591\n00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:49.840\nthat you can effectively allow\npeople access as they need.\n\n592\n00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:50.840\nAnd now I'm looking at our clock.\n\n593\n00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.950\nWe've got a little bit of time left.\n\n594\n00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:55.390\nI know you've got a little bit\nmore to go when it comes to users,\n\n595\n00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:56.190\ndo we have enough time?\n\n596\n00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:57.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I do exactly.\n\n597\n00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.480\nI really said two last little\nthings that I wanna mention.\n\n598\n00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.100\nThere is another type of user account that\ndoesn't technically exist in Mac OS but\n\n599\n00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.290\nworths mention here, and\nthat's an iCloud user account.\n\n600\n00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:12.470\nThat in the iCloud world you create an\niCloud account, and you saw when I logged\n\n601\n00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.720\nin as Daniel the first time it was\nasking me to log in with iCloud.\n\n602\n00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.500\n&gt;&gt; Do this now.\n\n603\n00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.520\n&gt;&gt; You can do that.\n\n604\n00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:21.930\nYou technically still have\na regular user account, in Mac OS.\n\n605\n00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:24.490\nIt just becomes connected\nto your iCloud account.\n\n606\n00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.160\nSo that's not officially a user account,\nin Mac OS.\n\n607\n00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.360\nIt's just something you're connected to.\n\n608\n00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.520\nIt's a cloud service you're connected to.\n\n609\n00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:35.100\nBut it is worth mentioning, that iCloud\nis becoming more and more prevalent.\n\n610\n00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.870\nThe other thing that I want to address is\nI showed you guys creating user account\n\n611\n00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:42.160\nand kind of the differences, but\nwe may need to delete user accounts.\n\n612\n00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.340\nSo if we don't need an account anymore,\nif we don't somebody on our system, for\n\n613\n00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.900\nexample I've got Daniel and\n\n614\n00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.470\nhe's sitting here in the background\nlet me switch over to Daniel.\n\n615\n00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:56.250\nAnd if i don't need Daniel's account\nanymore I can get him to log out,\n\n616\n00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:00.830\nand back under my account,\nI can remove his user.\n\n617\n00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:05.170\nNow when we remove a user account, it's\ngonna ask me a few questions, and that's\n\n618\n00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:08.590\nreally what I want to point out here\njust in case they show up on the exam.\n\n619\n00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:11.010\nWhen you delete a user account,\ndeleting the user is easy.\n\n620\n00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:15.270\nIt just deletes the user accounts\nentry in the database and that's that.\n\n621\n00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:18.250\nBut there's the Home directory\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n622\n00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:25.400\nIf I go back into my System Preferences\nand I go into Users and Groups.\n\n623\n00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.610\nAnd I find Daniel's account,\nwell I need to unlock it again.\n\n624\n00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.510\nSo let me unlock real quick.\n\n625\n00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:34.800\nAnd I find his account, I can remove\nhim just by hitting the minus button.\n\n626\n00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.990\nTo delete the account.\n\n627\n00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:37.200\nAnd when you do that,\n\n628\n00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.340\nit's gonna ask you about what you wanna\ndo with that person's home folder.\n\n629\n00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.980\nDo I wanna save their home\nfolder in a disk image?\n\n630\n00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:49.150\nIt'll actually package it all up into one\nDMG file that you can store somewhere.\n\n631\n00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.820\nAnd that way if I ever say,\nI need this file, Daniel was working on it\n\n632\n00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.560\nI could just mount that dmg file and\nget the data right there.\n\n633\n00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.030\nSo it's kind of building an archive\nof their home directory.\n\n634\n00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:00.970\nYou can tell it to leave the home\ndirectory right where it is.\n\n635\n00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:02.000\nDon't delete the home directory.\n\n636\n00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.980\nJust leave it there.\n\n637\n00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.900\nIt will be a /user, /daniel and\nI can pull it up later if I need to.\n\n638\n00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.380\nOr we can delete the home folder.\n\n639\n00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.480\nWe can get rid of it.\n\n640\n00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.070\nOkay.\n\n641\n00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.830\nNow, when you toast that home folder,\nit's gone.\n\n642\n00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.640\nIf you have a time machine backup, you can\nactually pull it from the time machine\n\n643\n00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.240\nbackup but otherwise it's gone and\nthat user is now removed.\n\n644\n00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.200\nAll right, now, why do I mention that?\n\n645\n00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.850\nI mention that because\nwhile we can delete a user,\n\n646\n00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:29.380\nthere is no way to undelete\na user to undo the process.\n\n647\n00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:34.220\nIf you do a full time machine restore\nthen it will roll your whole system back\n\n648\n00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.670\nwhich will bring the user account back,\nthat's one way.\n\n649\n00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:40.350\nBut there's no way to just say,\njust bring Daniel's account back, right.\n\n650\n00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:43.550\nBut fortunately it's\nUnix Under the Hood and\n\n651\n00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.690\nin the Unix world it really doesn't\ncare who the user is, right?\n\n652\n00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.660\nSo the fact that I deleted Daniel's\nreally not that big of a deal\n\n653\n00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.660\nas long as I still have\na copy of their Home folder.\n\n654\n00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.520\nTheir Home folder has all their\npreferences, their custom applications,\n\n655\n00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.420\ntheir documents, all the stuff that makes\nthat user account's experience unique.\n\n656\n00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:03.570\nSo as long as I save the Home directory,\nand I delete\n\n657\n00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:07.720\nDaniel's account, I can always just make\nan all new account, called Daniel Lowry.\n\n658\n00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.840\nJust give it the same name.\n\n659\n00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.970\nMake a new account with the same name, and\n\n660\n00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:13.120\nthen copy that Home folder\nback to where it was.\n\n661\n00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.940\nOr if you left it there,\nit's already there.\n\n662\n00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.510\nYou'll have access to it, and off you go.\n\n663\n00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:20.470\nSo it's easy to restore it that way,\nbut there's no official way to say,\n\n664\n00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:23.380\ngo to the Recycle Bin and\nthen pull it out of there, or the Trash.\n\n665\n00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.700\nYou can't do that, but\nif you still have the Home directory,\n\n666\n00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.060\nYou just create a new account with the\nsame name, and then copy your backup on\n\n667\n00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.040\nthe home directory back to that user's\nfolder, and now they're in business.\n\n668\n00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.670\nNow they're set up back\nthe way they were and\n\n669\n00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.540\nthey have the same access\nthan they did before.\n\n670\n00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.310\n&gt;&gt; Very important piece of information\nthere, especially with that home folder.\n\n671\n00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:43.940\nThat is something that if you are working\na lot with users Coming and going maybe\n\n672\n00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.700\nin the corporate environment, that you're\nactually going to want to take pretty\n\n673\n00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.890\nseriously because if someone had been\nthere for a long time and they retire.\n\n674\n00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:54.370\nThen it's like well Sally had that\non her folder, how do I get to that?\n\n675\n00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.450\nYou don't want to blow that away\nthen all that information is gone.\n\n676\n00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:00.560\nYou wanna make that accessible to the user\nthat's gonna come in and replace them.\n\n677\n00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.780\nSo very important things\nyou need to know about.\n\n678\n00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.590\nFor that,\n\n679\n00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:07.280\nthat being said Don we do appreciate\nyou lending your expertise on that.\n\n680\n00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.370\nIt's a lot of information for us to\ntake in so go and play with your Mac and\n\n681\n00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.250\nsee what you can do with creating\nusers and see how it all works.\n\n682\n00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:17.220\nMake sure you solidify those\ntheories in your mind.\n\n683\n00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.810\nBut as for this show it looks\nlike we've come to the end\n\n684\n00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.790\nof our lovely little episode here.\n\n685\n00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.410\nSigning off for

00:00:16.390\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.530\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.290\nin today's episode we are coming\nback at you with more\n\n9\n00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.350\nof our ACSP series the Apple certified\nsupport professional, that's right.\n\n10\n00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.060\nAnd joining us back in\nthe studio again to continue\n\n11\n00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.252\nhelping us out in that endeavor\nis our good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n12\n00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:34.140\n[LAUGH] Don welcome back\nsir how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.260\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be one of\nthose days isn't it?\n\n14\n00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.411\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's there we're already,\nit's fun, it's having a good time.\n\n15\n00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:40.778\n&gt;&gt; All right well I am excited to be\nhere because in the last episode we had\n\n16\n00:00:40.778 --> 00:00:43.227\na chance to talk about user accounts,\nall right.\n\n17\n00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:44.047\nAnd so we walked through all\n\n18\n00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:46.790\nthese different things about creating\nuser accounts, so it was very exciting.\n\n19\n00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.050\nBut there are a couple of features that\nI wasn't able to go into details cuz we\n\n20\n00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.970\ndon't have enough time.\n\n21\n00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.610\nSo, in this episode we're\ngonna revisit a couple\n\n22\n00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.420\nof things that I just wanna\naddress a little more in detail.\n\n23\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.930\nSpecifically we're gonna take\na look at fast user switching,\n\n24\n00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.490\nwhich is how we can move\nquickly between user accounts.\n\n25\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.800\nAnd we're gonna take a look\nat parental controls,\n\n26\n00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.760\nif I can remember what\nwe're talking about.\n\n27\n00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.120\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be one of those days.\n\n28\n00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.330\n&gt;&gt; It is, so we talk really briefly\nabout parental controls in the last\n\n29\n00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.940\nepisode but on the exam they expect you\nto know all the different features that\n\n30\n00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.400\nare available so we'll take a look at and\nwalk through those I said we'd do that.\n\n31\n00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.440\nAnd so\nhere I am delivering on my promise cuz\n\n32\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.400\nthat's the level of training we provide.\n\n33\n00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.246\n&gt;&gt; Mayoral candidate or something.\n\n34\n00:01:23.246 --> 00:01:24.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\n\n35\n00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.140\nI'll shake your hand and\nkiss the babies and\n\n36\n00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.490\nthen we'll get into fast user switching.\n\n37\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.030\nSo let's talk a bit about that,\n\n38\n00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.770\nif you watched the last episode,\nif you didn't it's okay.\n\n39\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.035\nBut if you did, you probably notice that I\nquickly jump between my user account and\n\n40\n00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:40.100\na user account I created for Daniel.\n\n41\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.170\nAnd if you were really sharp-eyed,\nyou might've noticed that my menu bar at\n\n42\n00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.970\nthe top of my screen actually\nchanged as the episode went\n\n43\n00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.000\non because of some of the things that\nwere happening in our system, right.\n\n44\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.180\nWhen you install macOS, when you bring\nup a brand new system running macOS,\n\n45\n00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.492\nit asks for your name, and\nit creates one user account.\n\n46\n00:01:58.492 --> 00:02:01.020\nAnd that one user account is just for\nyou, and there you go,\n\n47\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.970\nyou've got access to your system.\n\n48\n00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.790\nBut the moment you create\na second user account, so,\n\n49\n00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.460\nabout halfway through the last episode,\nI created an account for Daniel.\n\n50\n00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.080\nThe moment I created that account for\n\n51\n00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.730\nDaniel, it enables something\ncalled Fast User Switching.\n\n52\n00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.890\nAnd for most of it we see it as\na new entry up in our menu bar.\n\n53\n00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.920\nSo if we look in my desktop, here's my old\ndesktop like I'm used to, and what changed\n\n54\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.980\nis up here at the top right where\nI've got the Siri icon and Spotlight.\n\n55\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.880\nIt added my name, now at first this\ndoes not look like a terribly useful\n\n56\n00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.750\nfeature because believe it or not.\n\n57\n00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.015\n&gt;&gt; You know who you are.\n\n58\n00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:36.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can usually remember my name.\n\n59\n00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.330\nNow the time is nice cuz I never know what\ntime it is, or being able to click and\n\n60\n00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.003\nsee the date.\n\n61\n00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:44.659\nBut your name is not terribly useful,\nunless you've got more than\n\n62\n00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.980\none user account on the system, and\nyou're flipping between user accounts.\n\n63\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.113\nNow, it's helpful because I can\nsee who am I logged in as, right.\n\n64\n00:02:53.113 --> 00:02:56.339\nI also used another command in the last\nepisode, which is if you're in\n\n65\n00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.254\nthe terminal, because every\nuser is in the terminal, right.\n\n66\n00:02:59.254 --> 00:03:02.448\nYou can run the who am I command and\nit'll tell you who you are, right.\n\n67\n00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:05.148\nBut it's giving you your old Unix name, so\n\n68\n00:03:05.148 --> 00:03:09.520\nI see dpezet as opposed to seeing\nDon Pezet written out nice and neat.\n\n69\n00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.560\nBut most users don't ever launch the\nterminal, so they don't know about that.\n\n70\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.460\nSo it is kinda nice right up here\nto be able to see who it is that\n\n71\n00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.081\nI'm logged in as.\n\n72\n00:03:16.081 --> 00:03:19.291\nBut more importantly, I can click that and\n\n73\n00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:23.849\nI can switch between the other\nusers on my computer, right.\n\n74\n00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.779\nNow, there's a few different\nways that we can use this,\n\n75\n00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:30.685\nbut the way it's intended is to allow\nmore than one person to use the computer\n\n76\n00:03:30.685 --> 00:03:33.390\nwithout having to really\ninconvenience somebody.\n\n77\n00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.666\nAnd let me tell you what\nI mean by inconvenience.\n\n78\n00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:38.475\nLet's say that I'm working on my computer,\nright.\n\n79\n00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:43.179\nAnd I fire up Safari, and\nI browse to a website, we'll go to CNN.\n\n80\n00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:47.270\nAnd I'm doing stuff,\nright, maybe I fire up\n\n81\n00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.650\ntext edit and I start writing the great\namerican novel, whatever it is I'm doing,\n\n82\n00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.630\nand just doing all the work that\nI normally do in a given day.\n\n83\n00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.020\nI write novels everyday, all right,\nnow Daniel comes along and\n\n84\n00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.490\nsays hey Don I really need to\nuse the computer real quick.\n\n85\n00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.925\nAll right, so well,\nnormally I just tell him no, go away, but\n\n86\n00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:10.640\nif he has a legitimate use he\nneeds to use the computer.\n\n87\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.980\nI want him to be able to log in,\nwell what can I do?\n\n88\n00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.723\nOne of the things I can do is I\ncan just [COUGH] log out, right,\n\n89\n00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:19.670\n[COUGH] if I go to my Apple menu here and\nchoose log out.\n\n90\n00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.150\nI can log out it's gonna ask me,\n\n91\n00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.310\nand it offers to save the document\nthat I was working on.\n\n92\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.490\nWell, I haven't named it, now, I've gotta\nname it, if I don't, if I'm saying nah,\n\n93\n00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.920\nI'll just cancel.\n\n94\n00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.110\nI'm gonna lose my novel, right, so here,\nit's telling me actually kinda gotta\n\n95\n00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.880\nget out of this program or\nit can't log me out.\n\n96\n00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.320\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is taking so long, Don,\n\n97\n00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.265\nI've already figured out why\nyou usually tell me just no.\n\n98\n00:04:39.265 --> 00:04:40.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yep, and\n\n99\n00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.500\nso that's kind of a problem that we have.\n\n100\n00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.045\nNow, there is actually a way that we\ncan tell the macOS to kinda get around,\n\n101\n00:04:47.045 --> 00:04:48.910\nthere's like force close the apps and\nstuff.\n\n102\n00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.750\nBut the reason we don't want\nthat is we don't want to\n\n103\n00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.690\nlose the data that we're working on,\nright.\n\n104\n00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.420\nSo that's one of the problems\nwith just logging out and\n\n105\n00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.050\nletting somebody else log in.\n\n106\n00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.190\nThe other thing is what if I started some\nkind of long running operation, right.\n\n107\n00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.869\nMaybe I've got a file downloading\nin the background and\n\n108\n00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:06.928\nthat download is gonna take 30 minutes.\n\n109\n00:05:06.928 --> 00:05:11.507\nSo, I don't wanna stop,\nbecause it's a long download, but\n\n110\n00:05:11.507 --> 00:05:16.703\nnow Daniel needs to use the computer,\nand maybe we're connected to,\n\n111\n00:05:16.703 --> 00:05:21.568\nsome kind of ftp server,\nit's gonna switch me over to finder.\n\n112\n00:05:21.568 --> 00:05:24.636\nSo maybe,\nI'm connected to an ftp server and\n\n113\n00:05:24.636 --> 00:05:28.110\nI'm downloading some kind of large file.\n\n114\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.216\nLet's do Ubuntu,\nUbuntu's always giant, and\n\n115\n00:05:30.216 --> 00:05:34.020\n[COUGH] as I start doing the download,\nit needs to run for a while.\n\n116\n00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.270\nI just need to let it sit there and\ndo its downloading, I'm gonna open 10,000\n\n117\n00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.910\nfolders in this episode,\nI was trying to do something quick.\n\n118\n00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.250\nBut it's just gonna\nkeep downloading it and\n\n119\n00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.970\nI need him to be able to\nuse the computer too.\n\n120\n00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.420\nSo what Fast User Switching does\nis Fast User Switching kind of\n\n121\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.880\nfreezes what's going on on the system for\nme.\n\n122\n00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.200\nAnd let's him log in and do something.\n\n123\n00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.620\nNow I shouldn't say, for reasons,\nthat's not a good word here.\n\n124\n00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.670\nCuz it's not stopping the programs, it's\nletting the programs continue to run and\n\n125\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.520\ncontinue doing what they're doing.\n\n126\n00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.540\nSo if I've started a download it's\ngonna continue to do that download,\n\n127\n00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.010\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n128\n00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.160\nLet me,\nI will find something I can download here.\n\n129\n00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.000\nBut it will continue\nto do the download and\n\n130\n00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.210\nI don't have to worry about it being\ninterrupted or stopping or whatever.\n\n131\n00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.164\nIt can just keep going and\ndownloading it and working.\n\n132\n00:06:17.164 --> 00:06:22.247\nSo, then Daniel can use the system,\ndo whatever it is he intends to do, and\n\n133\n00:06:22.247 --> 00:06:27.192\nI can always return back to my account\nin time and come in and work with it.\n\n134\n00:06:27.192 --> 00:06:32.718\nHere we go finally, finding something like\n10,000 menu options to get through here.\n\n135\n00:06:32.718 --> 00:06:34.900\n&gt;&gt; We record for\nthe day like an Alabama tick.\n\n136\n00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] here we go, 1.4 gigs\nin size, so I'm gonna download this one\n\n137\n00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:44.210\nlittle file that took me 10,000\ntries to just get to, darn it.\n\n138\n00:06:45.382 --> 00:06:50.786\nAll right, so I'm gonna take this,\nand if I start that download,\n\n139\n00:06:50.786 --> 00:06:54.078\nlet me get a new finder window open here.\n\n140\n00:06:54.078 --> 00:06:59.151\nThis is painful, and I'll just kinda paste\nthen in here, so, there we go, all right.\n\n141\n00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:02.875\nSo it's starting to download, and\nthat file's 1.3 gigs in size or whatever.\n\n142\n00:07:02.875 --> 00:07:05.845\nSo it tells me it's gonna take a couple\nof minutes, I can come up here and\n\n143\n00:07:05.845 --> 00:07:08.895\nhit my Fast User Switching menu.\n\n144\n00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:11.025\nAnd I can switch over to Daniel, and\n\n145\n00:07:11.025 --> 00:07:14.985\nwhen I switch over to Daniel,\nnow it's gonna log in as him.\n\n146\n00:07:14.985 --> 00:07:18.620\nNow, what happened to my Safari\nwindow in the background?\n\n147\n00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.975\nWhat happened to my download\nthat's going on right now?\n\n148\n00:07:20.975 --> 00:07:24.740\nWhat happened to my text edit window\nthat has the great American novel in it?\n\n149\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.727\nThey're all still running,\nthey're all still there doing their thing.\n\n150\n00:07:27.727 --> 00:07:31.510\nBut now Daniel can log in,\nhe can fire up Safari, he can browse,\n\n151\n00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.171\nmaybe he doesn't want CNN,\nmaybe he wants Fox News, right.\n\n152\n00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:36.506\nWe're gonna fair and balanced today.\n\n153\n00:07:36.506 --> 00:07:41.360\nSo we're gonna browse on and start doing\nthe various things that he wants to do.\n\n154\n00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.450\nAnd he's able to use the computer,\n\n155\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.850\nmeanwhile all of my stuff is still\ngoing on well at the background, right.\n\n156\n00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.213\nWe're sharing the computer, and\nour user accounts are isolated,\n\n157\n00:07:51.213 --> 00:07:53.575\nhe can't see my stuff,\nI can't see his stuff.\n\n158\n00:07:53.575 --> 00:07:57.906\nSo that's a nice we have that separation,\nand we can quickly bounce back and\n\n159\n00:07:57.906 --> 00:07:59.268\nforth between the two.\n\n160\n00:07:59.268 --> 00:08:02.617\nOne of the problems you bump into with\na shared computer where you don't do this,\n\n161\n00:08:02.617 --> 00:08:05.330\nis one user might lock the screen and\nwalk away.\n\n162\n00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.351\nSo the other user comes up and wants to\nuse the computer, but the screen's locked.\n\n163\n00:08:08.351 --> 00:08:10.020\nIt's locked, what am I gonna do?\n\n164\n00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.820\nBut with fast user switching,\neven at the lock screen,\n\n165\n00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.650\nthey can choose to log in as themselves.\n\n166\n00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.810\nAnd it leaves the original\nusers applications running, so\n\n167\n00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.070\nthey don't lose their data.\n\n168\n00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.340\nThey don't lose the stuff\nthat they're using.\n\n169\n00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.190\nSo fast user switching sounds\nlike a pretty good thing.\n\n170\n00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.430\nWell, just like anything,\nthere's usually a negative side to it.\n\n171\n00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.127\nAnd there's a little\nbit of a negative side,\n\n172\n00:08:30.127 --> 00:08:31.836\nto fast user switching\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n173\n00:08:31.836 --> 00:08:35.450\nFirst off you user accounts aren't\ncompletely independent, right?\n\n174\n00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.279\nSo if I'm eating up a ton\nof memory on the system,\n\n175\n00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:42.007\nwhen Daniel switches over to his\naccount that memory is tied up.\n\n176\n00:08:42.007 --> 00:08:43.620\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna see\na performance degradation.\n\n177\n00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.200\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and especially if\nyou're using third party web browsers,\n\n178\n00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.480\nGoogle Chrome, boy it eats up some RAM.\n\n179\n00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.170\nIf I'm running it and he's running it,\n\n180\n00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.490\nwe're both consuming a ton of memory,\nright?\n\n181\n00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.430\nSo if I have some long\nstanding operation running,\n\n182\n00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.710\nlike here I'm eating up network bandwidth,\nwell, that's going to affect him as well.\n\n183\n00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.860\nSo these are all things that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n184\n00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.400\nThe other thing though is sometimes\npermissions can be a little on the strange\n\n185\n00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.020\nside, especially when it comes to\nremovable media and file vault.\n\n186\n00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.643\nSo, if I have removable\nmedia like a USB key, right?\n\n187\n00:09:15.643 --> 00:09:17.877\nWhich I've got one right here\nlaying on the desk somewhere.\n\n188\n00:09:17.877 --> 00:09:22.260\nSo, if I have a USB key and let's say\nthat I'm really paranoid about my data.\n\n189\n00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.582\nSo I encrypt it, so\nI've got an encrypted USB key.\n\n190\n00:09:25.582 --> 00:09:27.040\nAnd anytime I plug it into my computer,\n\n191\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.210\nI've gotta provide a key to unlock it,\nright?\n\n192\n00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.280\nSo I plug it in, I punch in my code and\nit unlocks the USB key.\n\n193\n00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.440\nWell, if I use fast use switching and\n\n194\n00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.670\nswitch over to Daniel,\nhe can access the key now, right?\n\n195\n00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.290\nBecause it's been unlocked.\n\n196\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:45.430\nWhen you unlock physical media, it unlocks\nfor everybody who's logged in right\n\n197\n00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:50.260\nthen at that moment, so\nthis is no longer isolated.\n\n198\n00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.558\nIt's not like your home directory\nthat only you can get to.\n\n199\n00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:56.396\nRemovable media is not tied to a user\naccount, and even if it's encrypted, if\n\n200\n00:09:56.396 --> 00:10:00.465\nyou've provided the key to unlock it that\nallows the operating system to get to it,\n\n201\n00:10:00.465 --> 00:10:02.871\nwhich in turn allows\nthe other users to get to it.\n\n202\n00:10:02.871 --> 00:10:06.148\nSo that's a scenario where you would not\nwant to have fast user switching right,\n\n203\n00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:09.150\nbecause you wouldn't want people to be\nable to get to your data like that.\n\n204\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.220\nSo it's not a perfect scenario,\nit's not something everybody wants.\n\n205\n00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.730\nAnd usually if you've got data that is\nreally private like that, odds are you\n\n206\n00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.410\ndon't want to have multiple user accounts\non your laptop in the first place, right?\n\n207\n00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.840\nYou need to have that separation there.\n\n208\n00:10:23.174 --> 00:10:26.150\nAll right, the other thing is,\nif Daniel is an administrator and\n\n209\n00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.620\nI am an administrator,\nwhile we are separated and\n\n210\n00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.850\nisolated by default, we're administrators.\n\n211\n00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:34.600\nSo you can actually get in and start to\nkind of mess around with other people.\n\n212\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.910\nIf I were to drop to a terminal for\n\n213\n00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:40.850\nan example, and take a look at\nthe processes that are running.\n\n214\n00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.540\nActually, I don't even need the terminal\nfor this, we can use the Activity Monitor.\n\n215\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.530\nIf I go into the Activity Monitor and\nI start to take a look\n\n216\n00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.470\nat all of the processes that\nare running on the system, right?\n\n217\n00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.020\nSo notice over here,\nthe User column shows DPezet, right?\n\n218\n00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.760\nSo I'm running all this stuff.\n\n219\n00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.540\nBut if I keep looking through,\nby default it's just showing me.\n\n220\n00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.540\nBut if we keep looking through you\ncan actually get it to show you where\n\n221\n00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.050\neverybody has processes.\n\n222\n00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.130\nSo I could see that Daniel has\nprocesses running in the background and\n\n223\n00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.480\nthe system has processes\nrunning in the background.\n\n224\n00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.960\nAnd when we do that we're able to see not\njust for those processes, but actually\n\n225\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.140\nbe able to terminate them and kill them\noff and start to interact with them.\n\n226\n00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.440\nSo I might see where Daniel\nhas Safari running and\n\n227\n00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.670\nif I'm an administrator I could actually\nkill his Safari process, right?\n\n228\n00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.970\nI can't see his screen, but\n\n229\n00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.976\nI can interact with it in certain\nways because I'm an administrator.\n\n230\n00:11:31.976 --> 00:11:35.240\nSo you need to be aware that\nthe administrators do have a little more\n\n231\n00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.800\naccess than what other people would.\n\n232\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.960\nNow, by default see how this says,\nactivity monitor my processes, so\n\n233\n00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.070\nI'm only seeing me?\n\n234\n00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:48.010\nIf I go up to my View menu, here's where\nI can change it to say all processes, and\n\n235\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.130\nnow I'm gonna see every user\nwhich I really wanted to see.\n\n236\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:56.000\nAnd when I sort this, oops,\nif I get my alphabet straight.\n\n237\n00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.960\nI can find Daniel in here somewhere,\nthere you are.\n\n238\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.950\nSo, here's a whole bunch of\nprocesses being run by Daniel.\n\n239\n00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.540\nAnd I think we're both running\nSafari right now, so if I search for\n\n240\n00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.880\nSafari I can find a bunch of Daniel's\n\n241\n00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.640\nprocesses here that are tied to Safari and\nthen I can find a bunch of my own, right.\n\n242\n00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.090\nSo there's the two separate instances of\nit and I can come in and kill off one of\n\n243\n00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.480\nhis or If he's an administrator\nhe could kill off some of mine.\n\n244\n00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.360\nSo we do have to be aware of that.\n\n245\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.950\nFaster switching is kind of nice if\nyou have a shared computer, but for\n\n246\n00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.590\na lot of us it's not\nnecessarily an ideal thing.\n\n247\n00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.090\nNow the other thing I want to\nmention is that this menu up top,\n\n248\n00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.080\nI didn't make that appear.\n\n249\n00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.290\nIt happened automatically.\n\n250\n00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:39.380\nThe moment you add a second user account\nthat menu appears up in the top bar.\n\n251\n00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.400\nYou can actually customize it and\nchange it if you need to.\n\n252\n00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.620\nSo if I get to my system\npreferences window,\n\n253\n00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.310\nwhich I'll do in approximately\n20 minutes from now.\n\n254\n00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.180\nThere we go.\n\n255\n00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.140\nIf you go into system preferences and go\ninto users and groups, inside of users and\n\n256\n00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.470\ngroups you've got login options.\n\n257\n00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.030\nAnd under log in options,\n\n258\n00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.000\nyou'll see where you can tweak\nthe fast user switching menu.\n\n259\n00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.440\nAnd you do need to unlock the screen for\nit so let me unlock.\n\n260\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.340\nThere we go.\n\n261\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:09.260\nAnd we so show fast users switching\nmenu as and it set to full name.\n\n262\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.630\nYou can change to account name which would\nbe the Unix names, mine would be D Pezet,\n\n263\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.330\nor you can make it view the Icon if\nyour bothering to set use for Icons.\n\n264\n00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.860\nI've got my little picture, so because\nI got my picture once I change that I\n\n265\n00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.160\nwould see the little picture up there\ninstead of seeing my name or whatever.\n\n266\n00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.210\nIt takes a little less screen real estate\nis really the only benefit of doing that.\n\n267\n00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:34.440\nOr you can just turn the menu off all\ntogether and say don't show it right?\n\n268\n00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.490\nAnd if we don't show it, now its gone.\n\n269\n00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.830\nAnd I kinda lose that ability.\n\n270\n00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:38.910\nI don't actually lose the ability,\n\n271\n00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.080\nyou can still hit the fast user switching\nscreen if you use the log out menu.\n\n272\n00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.370\nBut it just kinda takes\nit off that menu bar.\n\n273\n00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.720\nSo you can tweak that.\n\n274\n00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.444\nSo when you create a second user account,\nit's basically just turning this option on\n\n275\n00:13:49.444 --> 00:13:53.020\nby default and setting it to full name and\nadding it right up there.\n\n276\n00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.700\nAnd the reason I mention that here is that\nif I decide I don't want Daniel to have\n\n277\n00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.080\nan account anymore and\n\n278\n00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.930\nI come in and I delete his account,\nthe menu bar stays turned on, right?\n\n279\n00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.490\nSo I'd have to come in and turn it off\nto put it back the way that it was.\n\n280\n00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:07.437\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, well fast user switching\ndoes seem to be like an answer to a many\n\n281\n00:14:07.437 --> 00:14:10.620\nof our prayers when it comes to\nbeing able to log and to log off.\n\n282\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.908\nIs there any caveats, security concerns\nthat we may need to be aware of before we\n\n283\n00:14:14.908 --> 00:14:16.900\njust dive in willy-nilly using it?\n\n284\n00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.150\n&gt;&gt; There are a few problems\nyou can bump into.\n\n285\n00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:23.550\nThere are some applications that really,\nreally don't like being run twice, right?\n\n286\n00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.555\nSome applications,\napplication like Safari,\n\n287\n00:14:26.555 --> 00:14:29.310\nSafari you can launch 20\ntimes it doesn't care, right?\n\n288\n00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.463\nBut there's other applications like Final\nCut Pro that really only expect to be run\n\n289\n00:14:33.463 --> 00:14:34.470\none time.\n\n290\n00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.930\nAnd if you have two users that\nare both launching the application and\n\n291\n00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.000\nrunning it at the same time, they start\nto have contention for file access, and\n\n292\n00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.740\nthat's really where the problem\nhappens is on the file access side.\n\n293\n00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.534\nEven programs that like to be run more\nthan once can still have problems,\n\n294\n00:14:47.534 --> 00:14:48.720\nlike Microsoft Word.\n\n295\n00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.580\nI can open up four copies\nof Microsoft Word.\n\n296\n00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.390\nI can log in as four different\nusers that can all be running Word.\n\n297\n00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.380\nBut if we all try and\n\n298\n00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:59.100\nopen the same document at the same time\nthe first user locks the document.\n\n299\n00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.480\nThe second, third and fourth users, they\nmay be able to get a read-only copy of it,\n\n300\n00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.650\nbut they won't be able to have an\nexclusive access to be able to change it.\n\n301\n00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.950\nSo you can have where one\nuser locks a file and\n\n302\n00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.630\nthen the other users aren't\nable to work with it.\n\n303\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.530\nSo then you have to go and ask that other\nuser, hey can you log back in here and\n\n304\n00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.570\nclose this file, and\nit becomes a bit of a hassle.\n\n305\n00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.706\nSo that's one of the little quirks that\nwe need to be aware of with the fast user\n\n306\n00:15:18.706 --> 00:15:19.250\nswitching.\n\n307\n00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nit's got its own little caveats to it.\n\n308\n00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.800\nIt does occur, be aware of those.\n\n309\n00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.750\nIt's a very good thing to for\nus to work with, but\n\n310\n00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.339\nif you have something like what Don\nwas talking about, you might run\n\n311\n00:15:29.339 --> 00:15:32.740\ninto issues with people stomping on\neach other going, no I got to use that.\n\n312\n00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.840\nNo, no, I do.\n\n313\n00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.460\nSo just be aware that as happening.\n\n314\n00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.400\nNow Don,\nwe talked also about parental controls and\n\n315\n00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.010\nI was making a joke about how parental\ncontrols could be read one of two ways.\n\n316\n00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.488\nEither parents are controlling\nthe children on the system.\n\n317\n00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:47.098\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n318\n00:15:47.098 --> 00:15:51.220\nas grown children we have parents that\nneed some control over their computers.\n\n319\n00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.510\nCuz they don't know what the heck they're\ndoing and they get way out into the weeds.\n\n320\n00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.595\nI'm assuming the former rather than\nlatter is what we're talking about here.\n\n321\n00:15:57.595 --> 00:15:58.376\n&gt;&gt; Typically yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:15:58.376 --> 00:16:00.409\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, parental controls are designed to\n\n323\n00:16:00.409 --> 00:16:04.241\nlet us Basically, we create a safer\ncomputing environment for children, and\n\n324\n00:16:04.241 --> 00:16:05.237\nsometimes adults.\n\n325\n00:16:05.237 --> 00:16:06.646\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, what we can do is,\n\n326\n00:16:06.646 --> 00:16:10.148\nand I mentioned this in my last episode,\nright, when you create a user account,\n\n327\n00:16:10.148 --> 00:16:13.430\nyou have the option to manage the user\naccount with prep up controls.\n\n328\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.450\nAnd, I think you can turn it off.\n\n329\n00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:15.990\nSo, let me go back and we'll turn it on.\n\n330\n00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:20.130\nSo I'm gonna take Daniel's account here,\nand he's got a standard user, right?\n\n331\n00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.920\nAnd, if I want to manage him,\nwell actually, this is a good point,\n\n332\n00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.450\nfirst off notice how I can't\neven click on Daniel, right, and\n\n333\n00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.300\nthe reason is that,\nDaniel is logged in right now.\n\n334\n00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.510\nIf he's logged in right now, I can't\nmake changes to his account, can I?\n\n335\n00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.660\nSo, I need to either get him to log out or\ncreate a new user account, so\n\n336\n00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.610\nI'll just switch over and log him out\nreal quick and that'll take care of that.\n\n337\n00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.710\nBut again, just another thing with fast\nuser switching, sometimes it makes certain\n\n338\n00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:50.170\nthings that you normally do,\nthat you're just not able to anymore.\n\n339\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.555\nSo, let me log out as him,\nand we'll go back in.\n\n340\n00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:57.367\nI'm gonna try parental controls for his\naccount which is what we saw in the last\n\n341\n00:16:57.367 --> 00:17:01.293\nepisode, but what I want to do is spend a\nlittle more time talking about what those\n\n342\n00:17:01.293 --> 00:17:03.420\ncontrols are, right, and what we can do.\n\n343\n00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.700\nSo now that he is logged out,\nsee how he's not gray anymore?\n\n344\n00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.340\nNow I can choose him, and I can go in and\nI can modify his information.\n\n345\n00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.920\nSo I'm gonna turn on parental controls for\nhis account, and\n\n346\n00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.590\nI'm gonna Open up\nthe Parental Controls panel.\n\n347\n00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:17.760\nNow, you can do it from this button right\nhere, or if you just go back to your\n\n348\n00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.630\nsystem preferences,\nParental Controls has its own icon.\n\n349\n00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.100\nThis yellow icon, it's got a little\nstick person with a stick kid.\n\n350\n00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.960\nAnd if we go into that,\nwe can see the parental controls.\n\n351\n00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.340\nAnd, what we'll see is,\n\n352\n00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:32.660\neach user account here on the left side\nhas been manage by parental controls,\n\n353\n00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.118\nbecause you can set different controls for\ndifferent ones, right?\n\n354\n00:17:36.118 --> 00:17:39.575\nThink about it, If you're a standard\nfamily and you have 2.4 children,\n\n355\n00:17:39.575 --> 00:17:42.855\nyou might have one is ten years old,\nand one that's four years old.\n\n356\n00:17:42.855 --> 00:17:43.781\nAnd then, 0.4.\n\n357\n00:17:43.781 --> 00:17:44.501\n&gt;&gt; The other is on their way.\n\n358\n00:17:44.501 --> 00:17:45.878\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in some, but\n\n359\n00:17:45.878 --> 00:17:48.924\nthe ten year old might have different\nrequirements than a four year old, and\n\n360\n00:17:48.924 --> 00:17:51.475\nsee you can dictate different controls for\nthem.\n\n361\n00:17:51.475 --> 00:17:52.929\nSo I'm gonna unlock this real quick.\n\n362\n00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.160\nAnd then I'll take Daniel's account, and\n\n363\n00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.510\nlet's take a look at some of\nthe settings that are in here.\n\n364\n00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.490\nOne of the most useful\nones is the Apps tab.\n\n365\n00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.310\nUnder the Apps tab,\n\n366\n00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.990\nyou'll see where we can do things like\nwhether we allow the use of the camera.\n\n367\n00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.250\nThat's really important.\n\n368\n00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.500\nYou have FaceTime and\n\n369\n00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.430\nother types of application that\nmake using the camera really easy.\n\n370\n00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.650\nAnd, having children communicating on\nthe Internet especially is really,\n\n371\n00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.830\nreally dangerous.\n\n372\n00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.530\nSo, we can come in and\nwe can choose not to allow that.\n\n373\n00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.640\nThere's Allow joining\nGame Center multiplayer games.\n\n374\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.494\nThat is a big area that's a challenge with\nchildren right now, because many of these\n\n375\n00:18:24.494 --> 00:18:28.477\nonline games have chatrooms, where you're\nable to communicate with other players.\n\n376\n00:18:28.477 --> 00:18:33.058\nAnd lots of the players are not people\nwhose identity you can verify and\n\n377\n00:18:33.058 --> 00:18:35.290\noften are not trustworthy.\n\n378\n00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.940\nSo, we can choose to block that\ntype of access or to allow it.\n\n379\n00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.380\nWe can Limit email to allowed contacts,\n\n380\n00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.710\nthat's a nice one because you might\nhave an email account set up for\n\n381\n00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.830\nyour child, and you only want them\nto be able to email family members.\n\n382\n00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.680\nSo you can put in contacts, and that's\nthe only people that are allowed to email.\n\n383\n00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.280\nIt restricts that and\ncreates a safer email environment.\n\n384\n00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.770\nAnd more importantly,\nyou can Limit Applications.\n\n385\n00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.770\nYou can pick and choose which applications\nare appropriate for that child to run.\n\n386\n00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.390\nYou might not want them running Safari.\n\n387\n00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.900\nYou don't want them to\nhave Internet access.\n\n388\n00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.560\nWell, we have the Web tab for that, but\nyou can kind of restrict it that way.\n\n389\n00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.630\nYou can block Skype or FaceTime and say,\nI just don't want them to run those apps.\n\n390\n00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.250\nAnd then allow them to run other things.\n\n391\n00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.850\nMaybe you have children's programs or\nother applications.\n\n392\n00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.846\nBut you can kind of see, where you could\nuse this not just for children, right, or\n\n393\n00:19:17.846 --> 00:19:19.740\nolder children or\neven just high school kids.\n\n394\n00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.530\nTo say, I want you to be able to run\nthese educational applications, and\n\n395\n00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.510\nnot fire up a web browser and\ngo to Facebook.\n\n396\n00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.510\nThat's the kind of restriction we can do,\nall right.\n\n397\n00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.023\nThe Allowed Apps list, if you take\na look at it, you've got other apps and\n\n398\n00:19:32.023 --> 00:19:33.050\nutilities, right?\n\n399\n00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.820\nWhere is that coming from?\n\n400\n00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.590\nWell, most of it is coming from\njust right here on our Mac.\n\n401\n00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.760\nIt's actually showing all the apps\nthat I have installed here on the Mac.\n\n402\n00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.443\nAnd, this is my laptop, so\nI've got a ton of junk on it.\n\n403\n00:19:43.443 --> 00:19:46.032\nBut you can come through and\nsearch, that helps out a lot.\n\n404\n00:19:46.032 --> 00:19:46.982\nAnd on the Utilities,\n\n405\n00:19:46.982 --> 00:19:50.190\nthese are the applications that are\nusually a part of the operating system.\n\n406\n00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.950\nThere's a few that have\ngotten added onto it.\n\n407\n00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.990\nBut, things like Terminal, you probably\ndon't want people getting into terminal.\n\n408\n00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.750\nSo you can turn these on and off,\nand really restrict that access.\n\n409\n00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.930\n&gt;&gt; And Don, this works like a white list.\n\n410\n00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.730\nI'm saying allow this to happen.\n\n411\n00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.680\nif it doesn't have check,\nthen it's just allowed.\n\n412\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.452\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, yep.\n\n413\n00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:05.855\nAnd, it's already got\na couple of things checked.\n\n414\n00:20:05.855 --> 00:20:07.817\nSee like Calculator and\nCalendar are checked.\n\n415\n00:20:07.817 --> 00:20:10.441\nI might check off Safari or something.\n\n416\n00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:13.042\nYou pick and choose what you want.\n\n417\n00:20:13.042 --> 00:20:16.810\nSo for example, Disk Inventory X,\nright, is not checked.\n\n418\n00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.431\nI'm gonna leave that off, and we're gonna\nput this restriction on Daniel's account.\n\n419\n00:20:19.431 --> 00:20:23.266\nSo when Daniel logs in, he will not\nbe able to run disk inventory x,\n\n420\n00:20:23.266 --> 00:20:24.480\nwell hopefully.\n\n421\n00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.530\nAssuming it all works right.\n\n422\n00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.330\n&gt;&gt; That's the plan, right?\n\n423\n00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.140\n&gt;&gt; But you can go through and you can pick\nwhatever other applications you have.\n\n424\n00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.238\nYou do need to be a little careful.\n\n425\n00:20:30.238 --> 00:20:35.160\nSome applications like,\nI think my AJA controller, here, this one.\n\n426\n00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.110\nNotice this application, or actually\nthis is Logitech, good old Logitech.\n\n427\n00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.270\nEvery time it takes an update,\nthe application name changes.\n\n428\n00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.550\nThat's a problem, because every time\nit updates, I'd have to come in and\n\n429\n00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.100\nupdate this to reflect it.\n\n430\n00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.640\nUsually vendors are a little smarter about\nthat, Logitech's not doing it here, but\n\n431\n00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.430\nsome of the other ones,\nmost of these only show up one time.\n\n432\n00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.650\nThat's a benefit of making\nsure you use the App Store,\n\n433\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.440\nas it will ensure that things\nare actually registering right.\n\n434\n00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.820\nWell, Logitech did it right there.\n\n435\n00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.036\nSo anyhow, all right.\n\n436\n00:21:04.036 --> 00:21:07.164\nOn the website,\nhere's where we can say, all right,\n\n437\n00:21:07.164 --> 00:21:11.720\nDaniel's allowed to run Safari, but what\ndo we want to limit an access too, and\n\n438\n00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.732\nyou'll see where's it got Allow on\nunrestricted access to website,\n\n439\n00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:19.410\nI mean full access or I can try to\nlimit access to adult websites.\n\n440\n00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:21.980\nAnd to try there is\nreally important because,\n\n441\n00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.070\nnobody has a full list of every\nadult website that's out there.\n\n442\n00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.950\nAdult websites spring up\nlike crazy every single day.\n\n443\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.580\nSo they try and\nblock as many of them as they can.\n\n444\n00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:36.360\nBut oftentimes, the only way to really,\ntruly protect somebody's Internet access\n\n445\n00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.220\nis to do a white list, to say these\nare the sites they're allowed to get to.\n\n446\n00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:44.610\nAnd so we can come in here and say, like I\nwant to allow Daniel to be able to get to\n\n447\n00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.280\nlike CNN, but not Fox News, right?\n\n448\n00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.902\nSo Fox News is not in the list, so\nI don't have to worry about that,\n\n449\n00:21:51.902 --> 00:21:56.322\nthat'll be blocked and then if I choose to\nadd, I can add a bookmark here for CNN.\n\n450\n00:21:56.322 --> 00:21:59.428\nAnd we can just punch in the address for\nCNN, and\n\n451\n00:21:59.428 --> 00:22:04.253\nnow that bookmark will show up and\nthat's all that he'll have access to.\n\n452\n00:22:04.253 --> 00:22:05.335\nYou don't even need to\ntype in the address,\n\n453\n00:22:05.335 --> 00:22:07.550\nit will be right there with the bookmarks,\nwe'll be able to browse down.\n\n454\n00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:08.510\nEdit and browse.\n\n455\n00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.260\nRight now, we got time for kids and so on.\n\n456\n00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.391\nYou punch in whatever that you want,\nanything else is gonna be block.\n\n457\n00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.440\nThen we got Stores.\n\n458\n00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.480\nInside of the iTunes Store,\ninside of the Mac OS App Store,\n\n459\n00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:26.540\nthere are various divisions, right, like\nthe iBooks Store, movies, apps, and so on.\n\n460\n00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.660\nSo we can go up in here and\n\n461\n00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.020\nput in restrictions as to\nwhat they're allowed to do.\n\n462\n00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.230\nMaybe I want to allow them to be able to\nget to the iTunes Store, or iBooks, or\n\n463\n00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:34.040\nI wanna disable it.\n\n464\n00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.570\nI can come in and disable those and\nrestrict that access, right?\n\n465\n00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.650\nAnd then I can set the Age limits.\n\n466\n00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.860\nI might not want to allow\nmusic with explicit content.\n\n467\n00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.865\nSo if I check that off, they won't be able\nto download the latest 2 Live Crew album.\n\n468\n00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:47.089\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if\n\n469\n00:22:47.089 --> 00:22:47.718\nthey're still together or not.\n\n470\n00:22:47.718 --> 00:22:49.750\n&gt;&gt; In 1989.\n\n471\n00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.771\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm dating myself with what I know\n\n472\n00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:54.372\nabout explicit music.\n\n473\n00:22:54.372 --> 00:22:59.794\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure Taylor Swift comes\nwith that, explicit content now.\n\n474\n00:22:59.794 --> 00:23:03.566\n&gt;&gt; All right so, we can do movies or you\ncan set the age limits there, TV shows and\n\n475\n00:23:03.566 --> 00:23:07.299\nso one, right, this is all basically\nstandard stuff what you're used to.\n\n476\n00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.280\nUnder Time, this is a neat one,\n\n477\n00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.070\ncuz you might wanna restrict the amount of\ntime somebody can spend on the computer,\n\n478\n00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:18.330\nyou can set limits, and you can say on\nthe weekdays, he gets two hours of access.\n\n479\n00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.140\nAfter two hours, he is not allowed\nto use the computer anymore,\n\n480\n00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.410\nit doesn't care when the two hours are,\nyou get to pick, right?\n\n481\n00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.880\nSo here we can say, Limit weekday usage\nto three hours a day or 30 minutes or\n\n482\n00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.010\nfive hours or whatever.\n\n483\n00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.600\nSo they don't sit there just be\non the computer all day long.\n\n484\n00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.560\nYou can set a different restriction for\nweekends,\n\n485\n00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.170\nmaybe to get a little more time on\nthe weekends, and you can define Bedtimes.\n\n486\n00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:41.202\nSo, hey, your computer access stops at a\ncertain time regardless of whether you've\n\n487\n00:23:41.202 --> 00:23:42.999\nused your three hours or not, right?\n\n488\n00:23:42.999 --> 00:23:44.020\nIt's the limit.\n\n489\n00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.112\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don, if you set the amount\nof time, is that an aggregation?\n\n490\n00:23:47.112 --> 00:23:50.248\nLike if I use the computer for five\nminutes here and two hours later I come\n\n491\n00:23:50.248 --> 00:23:53.190\nback and I use it for ten minutes again,\ndoes it keep track of that?\n\n492\n00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.350\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Or is it like a block of time?\n\n493\n00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.955\n&gt;&gt; No, it keeps track, it adds up.\n\n494\n00:23:55.955 --> 00:23:58.727\nSo yeah, when it says three hours,\nyou might use 30 minutes in the morning,\n\n495\n00:23:58.727 --> 00:24:00.412\nan hour in the afternoon,\nmore in the evening.\n\n496\n00:24:00.412 --> 00:24:01.178\nIt just totals up.\n\n497\n00:24:01.178 --> 00:24:02.148\nIt does a really good job with that.\n\n498\n00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:07.529\nAll right, then we got Privacy, now,\nPrivacy is not really restricting his\n\n499\n00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:10.540\naccess, and more like protecting\nhis information, right?\n\n500\n00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.790\nSo whether they're allowed to make\nchanges to Contacts, Calendars and so\n\n501\n00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.790\non, we need to restrict this, right?\n\n502\n00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.140\nIf I don't want him to\nbe able to add Contacts,\n\n503\n00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.990\nbecause I have email limited to only email\ncontacts, then I could turn this off and\n\n504\n00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.070\nit won't be able to allowed\nto change his contacts.\n\n505\n00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:28.500\nThat's important, those two work together\nreally well, Facebook, right, Twitter,\n\n506\n00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.300\nI might want to block those, now,\nthis is not talking about the website,\n\n507\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.040\nI would control that with Safari.\n\n508\n00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.520\nThis is talking about adding the account\n\n509\n00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.920\ninside of the Internet accounts\noption in system preferences.\n\n510\n00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.620\nWhen you go into Internet accounts, you\ncan add Twitter and so on, you get some\n\n511\n00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:46.340\nintegration with Mac OS, so we can\ntweak that in other privacy settings.\n\n512\n00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.940\nAnd then last, we've got the other tab\nwhere we can do things like whether we\n\n513\n00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.480\nturn off Siri,\nnotice Siri is turned off here\n\n514\n00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.710\nbecause when I set up Daniel's account I\nchose to turn it off at the beginning.\n\n515\n00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:58.350\nIt's actually on default,\nyou might not want\n\n516\n00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.800\nyour children to be able to use Siri\nbecause they can ask Siri questions.\n\n517\n00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.650\n&gt;&gt; But\nyou might not want Siri to answer them.\n\n518\n00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:06.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, Siri,\nwhere do babies come from?\n\n519\n00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.080\nI'm curious what would she say to that, so\nyou've gotta have the hard conversations\n\n520\n00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.140\nearly, you've got other things\nlike printers and scanners.\n\n521\n00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:18.640\nBlocking CD and DVD access, that's\nan important one if you're worried about\n\n522\n00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.090\ndata getting out and so on, but these\nare all different things we can tweak.\n\n523\n00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.340\nUse the simple finder, is it really\ninteresting, if you've got very young\n\n524\n00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.340\nkids, it makes it where when they\nlaunch the finder they just see\n\n525\n00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.030\na couple of icons for the applications\nthat are proof one, that's it.\n\n526\n00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:35.440\nSo it really creates a simplified version\nof the operating system there, that's not\n\n527\n00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.630\nreally good for older children, but for\nyounger children it works out really well.\n\n528\n00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:44.200\nAll right, the other thing is took\naway down here at the bottom,\n\n529\n00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.820\nLogs, inside of Logs,\nhere's where we can come through and\n\n530\n00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:51.010\nwe can view the activity for\nparental controls.\n\n531\n00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:54.133\nAnd you can actually look at\nthe web history or the actions to,\n\n532\n00:25:54.133 --> 00:25:56.790\nyou're trying to get to\nsome inappropriate sites.\n\n533\n00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.440\nWe could start to see that and\nthat is a useful thing too for\n\n534\n00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.860\nbeing able to just see whether\nnot this is all working.\n\n535\n00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.480\nAll right, speaking of seeing it working,\n\n536\n00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.940\nat this point let's fast user\nswitch on over to Daniel.\n\n537\n00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.490\nSo I'm gonna jump over to Daniel's\naccount which is newly protected,\n\n538\n00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.060\nthanks to parental controls.\n\n539\n00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.734\nAnd assuming I know his password,\nthere we go, I can get logged in and\n\n540\n00:26:16.734 --> 00:26:19.725\nhe should be allowed to run Safari, right.\n\n541\n00:26:19.725 --> 00:26:24.472\nBut there was the Disk Inventory X,\nthat was the one I didn't approve,\n\n542\n00:26:24.472 --> 00:26:27.730\nso he shouldn't be allowed\nto run that program.\n\n543\n00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:31.993\nNotice how it's taking longer to\nget logged in, it's just having to\n\n544\n00:26:31.993 --> 00:26:36.789\nreprocess his account to make sure that\nhe only has access to certain things.\n\n545\n00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:40.868\nIt tried to run a program called Splashtop\nStreamer, that's the program that I use,\n\n546\n00:26:40.868 --> 00:26:44.834\nand he wasn't allowed to run it, so it's\nasking for administrative privileges to\n\n547\n00:26:44.834 --> 00:26:46.830\nallow it, but he's not allowed\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n548\n00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.620\nthat's gonna show up in the logs as well.\n\n549\n00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.428\n&gt;&gt; And that should show up in the logs,\nunless that was an autorun type thing,\n\n550\n00:26:51.428 --> 00:26:53.380\nit wasn't your fault this time at least.\n\n551\n00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.900\nAnd so we're gonna get some warnings on\nthat, let's see, I don't want to allow it,\n\n552\n00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.090\nit's gonna keep trying to launch,\nisn't it?\n\n553\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.030\nSo now that he's up and\n\n554\n00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.300\nrunning, wow that Splashtop software\nis gonna keep going, isn't it?\n\n555\n00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:09.420\nI might end up having to allow it,\nhe sees a bunch of applications, but\n\n556\n00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.310\nit doesn't necessarily have\naccess to all these applications.\n\n557\n00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.570\nAnd so, I'm gonna allow this one so\njust it stops bugging me, now,\n\n558\n00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.260\nas an administrator, I can override\nthis and so I'm punching in my\n\n559\n00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.420\nadministrative privileges there\nto override it and allow it in.\n\n560\n00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:28.190\nBut once he's in, he can browse in and\nstart to see the system like normal and\n\n561\n00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:32.460\nas he browses around he'll see\nvarious applications, right.\n\n562\n00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.350\nBut he might not have permission\nto run them all, so for example,\n\n563\n00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:39.070\nI mentioned that Disk Inventory X,\nlet me find that in here, right here.\n\n564\n00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:43.540\nWhen he goes to run it, the application\nDisk Inventory X can't be opened,\n\n565\n00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.230\nhe's not allowed,\nhe doesn't have privileges, so\n\n566\n00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.000\nhe's being blocked from\nopening that application.\n\n567\n00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.160\nBut applications like Safari,\nhe is allowed, so if we go through and\n\n568\n00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.350\nfind Safari in the list, a little bit\nfaster to use the doc, but there we go,\n\n569\n00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.680\nhe can launch Safari.\n\n570\n00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:01.850\nAnd here's all his bookmarks,\nincluding CNN that I added,\n\n571\n00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.020\nso if he clicks on that,\nit's gonna go to CNN.\n\n572\n00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.200\nNow, you do have to be a little careful\non this because very few websites\n\n573\n00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.368\ninclude all their content on\na single address anymore.\n\n574\n00:28:11.368 --> 00:28:16.040\nSo as he comes to this page, there's\ngonna be a lot of stuff that gets broken,\n\n575\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.650\nsee how there was an advertisement\nthat tried to pop up here and\n\n576\n00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.950\nparental controls is blocking it,\nit tried to access a different domain.\n\n577\n00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.102\nSo, you might actually have to do\na little bit of experimenting to figure\n\n578\n00:28:25.102 --> 00:28:27.700\nout all the domain names that\nare a part of rendering a site.\n\n579\n00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.815\nIn the case of CNN,\nI'm just losing the advertisements and\n\n580\n00:28:30.815 --> 00:28:32.910\nthat's not such a big deal to me.\n\n581\n00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:36.110\nBut there might be more important\npieces of a site that are missing that\n\n582\n00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:37.570\nyou're not able to get to.\n\n583\n00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:41.450\nAnd if he tries to go to another site,\nlike if I go to FOX News,\n\n584\n00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:43.560\nit gets blocked entirely because\nwe didn't approve that one.\n\n585\n00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.418\nIt wasn't in our white list for him to be\nable to get to, and It displays the list\n\n586\n00:28:47.418 --> 00:28:51.470\nof approved sites here so he can go to one\nof the approved ones like Discovery Kids.\n\n587\n00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.990\n&gt;&gt; How convenient.\n\n588\n00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.246\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there we go, all right, let's see,\n\n589\n00:28:54.246 --> 00:28:55.580\nwhat other restrictions do we have?\n\n590\n00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.700\nWe have the timed one, we could make\nthis a three hour episode and wait and\n\n591\n00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.930\nsee it end, that would be pretty boring.\n\n592\n00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.239\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just take our word for it,\n\n593\n00:29:03.239 --> 00:29:04.710\nfolks, [LAUGH] It works.\n\n594\n00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.634\n&gt;&gt; But basically, those are the options\nthat are available in parental controls,\n\n595\n00:29:07.634 --> 00:29:09.140\nit's really straightforward, right?\n\n596\n00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.820\nAll the options are pretty simple,\nand once you get it configured,\n\n597\n00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.060\nyou got a nice, safe environment.\n\n598\n00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.440\nAnd as your child gets older,\nyou can always go in and\n\n599\n00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.080\ntweak those settings to properly reflect\nwhat access you want them to have.\n\n600\n00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.870\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, interesting\nstuff with our parental controls,\n\n601\n00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:27.155\ngives us a lot of nuanced control\nover our children, right?\n\n602\n00:29:27.155 --> 00:29:30.930\nCuz we wanna protect them from things\nthat we either disagree with, or\n\n603\n00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.050\nmaybe it's too mature for their age level.\n\n604\n00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:37.600\nAnd as Don said, we can increase that\nlevel as they grow and mature themselves,\n\n605\n00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.120\nso, it's very nice thing to have.\n\n606\n00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.118\nThank you Apple, for putting that\nin there for us we because hey,\n\n607\n00:29:42.118 --> 00:29:44.258\nwe've gotta protect our young ones, right.\n\n608\n00:29:44.258 --> 00:29:47.058\nThat being said, Don, do we have anything\nelse that we need to cover when it comes\n\n609\n00:29:47.058 --> 00:29:49.175\nto multiple user access,\nthings that we would need to know?\n\n610\n00:29:49.175 --> 00:29:51.705\n&gt;&gt; I think that's about it for this one,\nwe do have a little bit more to talk about\n\n611\n00:29:51.705 --> 00:29:53.415\non user counts but\nwe'll cover that in another episode.\n\n612\n00:29:53.415 --> 00:29:56.495\nBut as far as fast user switching and\nparental controls,\n\n613\n00:29:56.495 --> 00:29:58.015\nI think that's a pretty\ngood deep dive on it.\n\n614\n00:29:58.015 --> 00:30:00.249\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff,\nwe thank you for joining us today,\n\n615\n00:30:00.249 --> 00:30:03.378\nwe do thank our audience for watching,\nbut it looks like it's that time for\n\n616\n00:30:03.378 --> 00:30:06.280\nus to sign off, for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel

greetings, everyone, and welcome\nto another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:20.015\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode, of course, we are coming\n\n8\n00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:25.700\nback at you with more on our ACSP series,\nthe Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n9\n00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.250\nAnd joining us in the studio again today\nis our Apple support, see I can't say it,\n\n10\n00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.785\nsupport professional,\nthat's a difficult word to say.\n\n11\n00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:33.630\n[LAUGH] Don Pezet.\n\n12\n00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.520\nDon, welcome back, man.\n\n13\n00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.206\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; I think we need some support.\n\n14\n00:00:36.206 --> 00:00:36.937\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:40.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or professional-\n&gt;&gt; You say that three times, man.\n\n16\n00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.715\nI I challenge you, sir.\n\n17\n00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:43.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll pass, all right.\n\n18\n00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you called my bluff.\n\n19\n00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.370\nIn this episode, we are gonna be\ntalking about user account security.\n\n20\n00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.830\nAnd with user account security,\n\n21\n00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.030\nthere's actually a number of different\ncomponents that we need to be aware of.\n\n22\n00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.890\nWe've kind of been talking about it\nalready, in the previous episodes\n\n23\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.970\nas we created accounts and we saw some of\nthe different things we could control.\n\n24\n00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.850\nSo I want to go on a slightly\ndifferent route here and\n\n25\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.650\ntackle a few topics that\nare almost like odds and ends.\n\n26\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.970\nA little just a, I don't know, potluck of\nsecurity options that are available and\n\n27\n00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.800\nI want to start with passwords.\n\n28\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.080\nNow every user account has a password,\nif you choose to make it.\n\n29\n00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.820\nI guess you could leave it\nblank if you were really crazy,\n\n30\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.550\nbut most of our user accounts\nare going to have a password.\n\n31\n00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.750\nAnd the password is tied to just that\none account, if you have five accounts,\n\n32\n00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.660\nyou get five different passwords.\n\n33\n00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.560\nWell there is another type of\npassword that can be assigned\n\n34\n00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.870\nany system running MacOS\nthat applies to everybody.\n\n35\n00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.350\nAnd that's called a firmware password.\n\n36\n00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.490\nFirmware passwords aren't tied to a user\naccount, they're tied to the firmware.\n\n37\n00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.090\nIn other words, the software that runs\nright on the motherboard of your laptop or\n\n38\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.540\ndesktop, or your Mac Mini,\nwhatever it happens to be.\n\n39\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.130\nFirmware passwords are really,\nreally important for protecting your data.\n\n40\n00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.050\nBecause normally when somebody\npowers on your Mac right,\n\n41\n00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.740\nit powers on to gets\nthe login's screen and\n\n42\n00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.350\nif they've got a password they can\nlog in and get your data right?\n\n43\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.740\nIf they don't have a password they\ncan't get your data, your data is safe.\n\n44\n00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.540\nBut what if they booted up the Mac and\n\n45\n00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.000\ndidn't log in, but\ninstead booted from a USB key.\n\n46\n00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.410\nThey booted from some\nalternate operating system.\n\n47\n00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.470\nNow they don't have to log into your\nOS they can log into their own.\n\n48\n00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.520\nThey booted off of their\nown installable media and\n\n49\n00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.570\nwhen they do that, now they can browse\nthe hard drive and get at your data.\n\n50\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.900\nThey've effectively bypassed\nthe security controls inside of MacOS.\n\n51\n00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.690\nWell, a little bit later in this episode,\nI'm gonna talk about File Vault.\n\n52\n00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.130\nHow we can encrypt our hard\ndrive to protect from that.\n\n53\n00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.890\nBut there is another option and\nthat other option is a firmware password.\n\n54\n00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.270\nAnd what a firmware password does it says,\n\n55\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.490\nwhen this computer gets turned on,\nit's gonna boot macOS.\n\n56\n00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.620\nAnd you have to login to get access.\n\n57\n00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.380\nAnd if you try and\n\n58\n00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.930\nbypass that in any way you'll have\nto provide the firmware password.\n\n59\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.940\nAnd if you don't provide the password\nthen you can't bypass it, right?\n\n60\n00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.390\nSo this protects us from\nuser account bypasses\n\n61\n00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.750\nthat anybody can go to any Linux\ndistribution really but even macOS.\n\n62\n00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.510\nI could take this, this is a macOS\nSierra install media we made back in\n\n63\n00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.660\nEpisode number one I guess.\n\n64\n00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.370\nI can go to any Mac and power on the Mac,\nhold the option key while it booted,\n\n65\n00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.290\nand once I hold the option key it'll\nbring up the boot menu, it'll show me all\n\n66\n00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.900\nthe disks including this one and\nI can choose this disk to boot off of.\n\n67\n00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.370\nAnd once it boots off of this I\ncan go into the terminal, and\n\n68\n00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.380\nthen in the terminal I can\nnavigate across the disks.\n\n69\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.760\nI can access whatever I wanted, right?\n\n70\n00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.460\nAnd that's right here,\nwe're just strictly inside of MacOS.\n\n71\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.000\nI don't even need to use Linux or\nanything crazy like that.\n\n72\n00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.610\nJust standard tools we got laying around.\n\n73\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.670\nBut if I go to a Mac and\ntry to boot off this and\n\n74\n00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.260\nI hold the option key on\nthe keyboard while I boot and\n\n75\n00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.700\nits got a Firmware password,\nI won't be able to pick this.\n\n76\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.320\nI'll have to provide\nthe firmware password and\n\n77\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.590\nif I don't have that,\nthe only choice I'll have is to boot\n\n78\n00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.710\noff of macOS that's on that system\nwhich would then require a password.\n\n79\n00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.710\nSo a firmware password is a good idea.\n\n80\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.410\nAs long as you're using the system\nnormally you'll never even see it so\n\n81\n00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.940\nit doesn't really impact you.\n\n82\n00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.120\nSetting a firmware password's pretty easy.\n\n83\n00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.010\nTo do it, all you have to do is\nreboot your Mac into recovery mode.\n\n84\n00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.930\nTo boot into recovery mode, well, you\ncan boot holding Cmd+R on your keyboard.\n\n85\n00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.070\nSo if you power off your Mac,\nhold Cmd+R on the keyboard and\n\n86\n00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.460\nhit the power button, then it'll power up.\n\n87\n00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.070\nIt'll see your holding Cmd+R and\nit'll boot to recovery.\n\n88\n00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.370\nAnother option is you can hit the power\nbutton and then hold the option key.\n\n89\n00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.290\nAnd in the option list you should\nsee recovery partition there.\n\n90\n00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.990\nThere are some Macs that don't\nhave recovery partitions though.\n\n91\n00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.120\nSo if that's the case you'll need to\nuse internet recovering command and\n\n92\n00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.160\nI'll do that for you.\n\n93\n00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.656\nBut if you boot to recovery inside\nof the recovery windows you actually\n\n94\n00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:38.975\nhave the ability to\nsetup firmware password.\n\n95\n00:04:38.975 --> 00:04:40.165\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n96\n00:04:40.165 --> 00:04:42.922\nI took my laptop and booted it to\nrecover right before the show.\n\n97\n00:04:42.922 --> 00:04:45.685\nI did it before hand because it takes\na little while, it's kind of boring.\n\n98\n00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:49.150\nSo what I did, is I hit power on my\nlaptop and held the option key and\n\n99\n00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.255\nthen I chose the recovery partition and\nthis is what it is booted to.\n\n100\n00:04:53.255 --> 00:04:56.615\nAnd once you boot into your recovery,\nyou see options like restoring from time\n\n101\n00:04:56.615 --> 00:05:00.250\nmachine, reinstalling MacOS,\ngetting help online and disk utility.\n\n102\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.180\nAbsolutely nothing to do with passwords,\nright.\n\n103\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.560\nBut if you go up to the utilities menu,\nin the utilities menu,\n\n104\n00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.110\nyou'll see the firmware password utility.\n\n105\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.850\nAnd we can take that firmware password\nutility, and if you click on that,\n\n106\n00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.440\nit'll let us turn on a firmware password,\nand assign that password right here.\n\n107\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.040\nIf you do that, anybody trying to\nbypass the operating system will be\n\n108\n00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.460\nrequired to provide this password\nin order to get into the system.\n\n109\n00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.800\nSo I'm gonna go and set the password and\n\n110\n00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.810\nthere we go,\nnow I got a firmware password.\n\n111\n00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.150\nSo if I reboot the system and\ntry and bypass the firmware I\n\n112\n00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.780\nbypass the operating system on the drive,\nit's gonna prompt me for that password.\n\n113\n00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.040\nAnd you could remove it the same way.\n\n114\n00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.810\nIf you go back into the firmware password\nutility, if it sees that you've already\n\n115\n00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.290\ngot a password it'll have\nthe option to turn it off.\n\n116\n00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.680\nI haven't actually rebooted it yet\nso it hasn't truly turned it on.\n\n117\n00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.270\nBut once I reboot it'll turn that on.\n\n118\n00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.780\nAnd we can just go right back into that\nwizard and turn it back off again.\n\n119\n00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.158\nSo a firmware password\nis easy to turn on and\n\n120\n00:05:58.158 --> 00:06:01.739\nit only shows up when somebody is\ntrying to alter the boot order.\n\n121\n00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:04.300\nSo most users will never even see it and\nit makes your system safer,\n\n122\n00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.150\ndefinitely something\nyou'll want to turn on.\n\n123\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.750\n&gt;&gt; Now Don obviously if\nwe somehow forget or\n\n124\n00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.520\nmisplace what this password is we're in\na lot of trouble, at that point, right?\n\n125\n00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.800\nIs there anything we can do?\n\n126\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.210\n&gt;&gt; Well you're not in a lot of trouble,\nright?\n\n127\n00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.030\nBecause it only comes up when\nyou bypass the boot order.\n\n128\n00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.990\nSo you'll still be able\nto boot into Mac OS.\n\n129\n00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.770\nYou'll still be able to use\nyour computer like normal.\n\n130\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.850\nNormal, you just can't reset\nthe firmware password, right?\n\n131\n00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:27.710\nYou can't get back in there.\n\n132\n00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.200\n&gt;&gt; That makes my selling of stolen\nlaptops on eBay a whole lot more\n\n133\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.880\ndifficult, though.\n\n134\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, and that's kinda the point.\n\n135\n00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.500\nAnd you do forget your firmware password,\n\n136\n00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.590\nthe way you reset it is you take\nyour device down to the Apple store.\n\n137\n00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.500\nThey can reset it for you, but you'll have\nto have proof of ownership of the device,\n\n138\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.240\nand that's what stops people from stealing\nlaptops and being able to resell them.\n\n139\n00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.080\nBecause they will have proof of purchase,\n\n140\n00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.676\nthey can show they\nactually own that device.\n\n141\n00:06:51.676 --> 00:06:54.340\nAll right, Firmware passwords\nare one thing I wanted to show you,\n\n142\n00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.180\nanother thing is our regular\nuser password, right?\n\n143\n00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.820\nIn our early episode we created user\naccount and we signed passwords.\n\n144\n00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.685\nIt was great, it was exciting and\n\n145\n00:07:00.685 --> 00:07:05.010\nexhilarating but\npeople forget password like Daniel said.\n\n146\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.390\nAnd if someone forget the password,\n\n147\n00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.550\nyou can just go in the user\nin groups system preference.\n\n148\n00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.210\nYou can use the user and\nthen change the password.\n\n149\n00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.650\nNot a big deal.\n\n150\n00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.430\nWell, what if you forget your password?\n\n151\n00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.690\nWhat if the administrator?\n\n152\n00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.190\nThe administrator of this computer and\nI forgot my password.\n\n153\n00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.720\nWell, that's a bigger problem.\n\n154\n00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.350\nNow, I can't just and\nreset my own password because I forget it.\n\n155\n00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.740\nWell I've got two options,\nif I forget my password.\n\n156\n00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.545\nOption number one, is when you first log\ninto a Mac, like a new system running\n\n157\n00:07:34.545 --> 00:07:39.300\nMacOS, it kinda bugs you a little bit\nabout connecting to your iCloud account.\n\n158\n00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.220\nIf you connect it to your iCloud account,\nthen all you have to\n\n159\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.520\ndo is go to the iCloud website and choose\nto reset your password or to recover it.\n\n160\n00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.870\nActually when you try and log in and\nit fails it'll prompt you and\n\n161\n00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.920\nsay hey do you wanna use\niCloud to recover this?\n\n162\n00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.698\nAnd you can do it.\n\n163\n00:07:50.698 --> 00:07:53.290\nSo if you've link to your iCloud account\n\n164\n00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.060\nyou can use that to reset your\ncomputer password and get back in.\n\n165\n00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.642\nSo that's one approach.\n\n166\n00:07:57.642 --> 00:07:58.862\nBut if you're like me?\n\n167\n00:07:58.862 --> 00:08:01.880\nI don't like linking to iCloud for\nmy log ins.\n\n168\n00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.890\nI usually don't.\n\n169\n00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:06.164\nSo If I forget my password just how I log.\n\n170\n00:08:06.164 --> 00:08:08.340\nWell no, when you boot to recovery,\n\n171\n00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.400\nthere's actually a way\nto recover we can go in.\n\n172\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.420\nAnd we can reset our own password.\n\n173\n00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.850\nSo on my laptop, my user account is\ndpezet, right, so that I usually login as.\n\n174\n00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.980\nAnd if I forget my password,\nI can boot in the recovery right here.\n\n175\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.790\nAnd I can go into the terminal.\n\n176\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.250\nSo I'm gonna go up here to my utilities\nmenu, and I'm gonna launch the terminal.\n\n177\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.310\nAnd the terminal here this is gonna\nbe unfriendly back end of macOS.\n\n178\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:33.930\nNormally we see the nice, friendly,\n\n179\n00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:38.770\nhappy front where is a GUI,\neverything is super simple.\n\n180\n00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.020\nBut when we boot in to recovery and\n\n181\n00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.080\nwe launch the terminal, one of the things\nyou'll notice is this weird prompt.\n\n182\n00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.960\nIt's a lot different on\nwhat you normally see.\n\n183\n00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.390\nThis is a full root shell.\n\n184\n00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.770\nI have full access to this system,\nwell within certain limits.\n\n185\n00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.530\nBut for the most part I can\nperform any action I want.\n\n186\n00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.630\nI could erase the hard drive\nif I want it from here.\n\n187\n00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.300\nThat's why recovery is\nsuch a dangerous thing.\n\n188\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.430\nThat's why you want to\nhave a firmware password.\n\n189\n00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.560\nYou wanna prevent people\nfrom getting here.\n\n190\n00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.650\nBut one of the utilities that\nyou have that has a GUI, but\n\n191\n00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:13.070\ndoesn't have an icon in here\nis the reset password utility.\n\n192\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:18.710\nIf you just type reset password and\nrun that, it's gonna execute\n\n193\n00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.810\nand you'll start to see a bunch of\nstuff crawling across the screen, okay?\n\n194\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:28.100\nWhat it's trying to do is it's attempting\nto launch the graphic user interface for\n\n195\n00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.960\nthe password reset utility, so that I\ncan come in here and change my password.\n\n196\n00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.110\nNow when I do that, see I'm trying to\nlaunch the key recovery assistant,\n\n197\n00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.720\nthat what's gonna let me\nreset my own password.\n\n198\n00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.155\nAnd it may take a moment, let me see\nit didn't launch on the background?\n\n199\n00:09:41.155 --> 00:09:42.340\nYup, it did.\n\n200\n00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.900\nSo I made my window really big, so I\ncouldn't see it but it actually did launch\n\n201\n00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.400\nright there in the background and\nthere's my reset password window.\n\n202\n00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.910\nAnd it's offering for\nme to reset passwords.\n\n203\n00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.800\nAnd I can reset Daniel's password,\nor I can reset mine.\n\n204\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.870\nNow I'm the administrator, right?\n\n205\n00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.403\nIf I know my password, I don't need to\nuse this utility to reset Daniel's.\n\n206\n00:09:59.403 --> 00:10:02.170\nI can just log in as me and\ngo in and reset his account.\n\n207\n00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.645\nSo we really only use this for\n\n208\n00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:07.730\nadministrators when you've completely\nlost access to this laptop.\n\n209\n00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.420\nWe can come in here and\nchoose our account, and\n\n210\n00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.880\nas we move forward it will let\nus reset that password, right?\n\n211\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.730\nNow notice what it's\noffering here it says,\n\n212\n00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.650\nif you can't log in because you forgot\nyour password you can reset it now.\n\n213\n00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.830\nAnd it's asking me to\nenter the password for me.\n\n214\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.870\nBut it's asking for\nmy email address, don@itprotv.\n\n215\n00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.020\nWhy is that?\n\n216\n00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.880\nCuz I logged in with an iCloud account.\n\n217\n00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.120\nIf you logged in with an iCloud account,\n\n218\n00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.970\nsee you got this forgot Apple ID or\npassword?\n\n219\n00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.000\nYou can click on that and\n\n220\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.460\ninitiate using your Apple ID to reset that\npassword which makes a life a lot easier.\n\n221\n00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.353\nAssuming you got network access.\n\n222\n00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:48.740\nAssuming that you've got an Apple ID\nthat you're connected to, okay?\n\n223\n00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.840\nIf you didn't connect to an Apple ID,\nright, so let me go back here and\n\n224\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.270\nI'll take Daniel's account.\n\n225\n00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.540\nDaniel, we didn't connect\nhim to an Apple ID.\n\n226\n00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.280\nAnd so here it just says, okay,\njust punch in a new password.\n\n227\n00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.700\nI can override his password right here.\n\n228\n00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.840\nIt's far less secure,\n\n229\n00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.321\nbecause I don't have to prove any\nownership of Daniel's account here.\n\n230\n00:11:08.321 --> 00:11:11.836\nI can just come in and say all right well\nhis password is now gonna be password123,\n\n231\n00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:13.360\ngood luck Daniel.\n\n232\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.350\nSo there we go, so I'm gonna reset it.\n\n233\n00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.850\nNow I can do that because\nI got into recovery, and\n\n234\n00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.450\nI now have access to the system\nto be able to do that, right?\n\n235\n00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.510\nSo using the iCloud\nRecovery is more secure.\n\n236\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.440\nCuz I at least have to have ownership of\nthat email address to get the password\n\n237\n00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.230\nrecovery email and\ngo through that process.\n\n238\n00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.040\nAnd you'll get a text\nmessage to your phone, or\n\n239\n00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.340\nwhatever levels of security you've set up.\n\n240\n00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.640\nIf it's just a local account,\nyou can override it really easy\n\n241\n00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.800\nwhich is another reason why you really\nwanna have that firmware password, cuz if\n\n242\n00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.440\nsomebody tries to boot to recovery they'll\nhave to have the firmware password.\n\n243\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.080\n&gt;&gt; So the old added job, if I can touch\nyour computer it's no longer your computer\n\n244\n00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.730\nis still holding true.\n\n245\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.820\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely right.\n\n246\n00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.570\nIf I grabbed somebody's Mac and\nran away, and powered it on and\n\n247\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.320\nhad a password, the first thing I\ncould do is try to boot to recover.\n\n248\n00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.100\nAnd if I can get the recovery I can\nreset their password and log in as them.\n\n249\n00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.190\nNow that doesn't mean I'm\ncompletely screwed, right?\n\n250\n00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.980\nIt's bad, but it's definitely not a good\nthing, but there are certain things that\n\n251\n00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.280\nare still protected and\nlet's talk about the Keychain.\n\n252\n00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.150\nEvery user account has a Keychain.\n\n253\n00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.870\nAs you log in to websites,\nas you launch applications,\n\n254\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.500\nas you connect to network shares,\nmacOS is recording your passwords, right?\n\n255\n00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.346\nNot nefariously-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n256\n00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:21.148\n&gt;&gt; It actually asks you, it says,\n\n257\n00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:22.201\ndo you wanna save your password, right?\n\n258\n00:12:22.201 --> 00:12:23.609\n&gt;&gt; And selling them on the tor network,\nright?\n\n259\n00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:25.085\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n260\n00:12:25.085 --> 00:12:28.415\nif you chose to save your passwords,\nthey're being locked into a Keychain,\n\n261\n00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:30.230\nand the Keychain is encrypted.\n\n262\n00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.880\nWell, it's encrypted with your password,\nright?\n\n263\n00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.760\nSo like Daniel's was being\nencrypted with his old password.\n\n264\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.820\nI just reset his password.\n\n265\n00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.350\nSo when I login as him now\nwith a password that I own.\n\n266\n00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.010\nDoes that mean I have access\nto his whole Keychain?\n\n267\n00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.770\nNo, the Keychain password is separate.\n\n268\n00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.840\nSo at this point,\nif I restart the computer.\n\n269\n00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.960\nI'm gonna go ahead and restart.\n\n270\n00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.080\nMy screen's gonna go black and stuff,\nso we can just wait on that to reboot.\n\n271\n00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.820\nBut when it restarts,\nI can log in as Daniel.\n\n272\n00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:02.370\nAnd when i log in as him, well I can\nuse the password that I assigned.\n\n273\n00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:07.660\nPassword123, but\nhis Keychain is going to remain locked.\n\n274\n00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.360\nAnd that means i can't get\nall of his passwords, and\n\n275\n00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.180\nits going to have to be with\ncode Keychain Recovery.\n\n276\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.470\nKeychain Recovery ends\nin one of two scenarios.\n\n277\n00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.350\nScenario one,\nhe has control of his iCloud account or\n\n278\n00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.780\nremembers his old password, and\nnow it can unlock the Keychain.\n\n279\n00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.400\nThe Keychain is actually locked\nwith your account password.\n\n280\n00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.010\nThat's the private key it\nuses to encrypt the database.\n\n281\n00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:32.840\nSo if you don't know your password,\nwell you're kinda out of luck.\n\n282\n00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.840\nSo that's scenario two.\n\n283\n00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.749\nScenario two is it just deletes your\nKeychain and creates an empty one.\n\n284\n00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.360\nThat's fine, right?\n\n285\n00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.770\nI'm okay with that, it can save new\npasswords as I go and access sites,\n\n286\n00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:43.650\nand stuff like that.\n\n287\n00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:47.220\nSo if you know your password you would\nhave done the password reset in the first\n\n288\n00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.130\nplace, so that shouldn't be a problem.\n\n289\n00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.640\nSo normally, the end result is\nthat Keychain recovery runs or\n\n290\n00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.050\nKeychain repair and\nit ends up erasing itself.\n\n291\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.480\nSo if I take Daniel's account here and\n\n292\n00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.840\ngo to log in as him I reset his\npassword to be password123, right?\n\n293\n00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.980\nThat's not what his original password was.\n\n294\n00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.970\nSo his Keychain is locked, and\n\n295\n00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.910\nhis Keychian, it's gonna give me a warning\nhere and I know it's really hard to read,\n\n296\n00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:14.210\ncuz it's small, but it says, the system\nwas unable to unlock your Keychain, or\n\n297\n00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.030\nwas unable to unlock your log in Keychain,\nhere we go.\n\n298\n00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:21.440\nIt says if you remember your old password\nyou could update the Keychain password.\n\n299\n00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.480\nWhat it'll do is it'll decrypt\nthe Keychain with your old password and\n\n300\n00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.950\nthen re-encrypt it with the new one,\nso that they're in sync.\n\n301\n00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.120\nYou want your user account and\n\n302\n00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.000\nKeychain to have the same password to\nbe able to unlock automatically, right?\n\n303\n00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.520\nBut then, it says you can\ncreate a new login Keychain or\n\n304\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.380\nchoose to leave the login Keychain\nusing a different password if you want.\n\n305\n00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.360\nIf you leave it using\na different password and\n\n306\n00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.560\nyou don't know the password you won't\nbe able to use the Keychain anymore.\n\n307\n00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.530\nYou've effectively disabled the Keychain.\n\n308\n00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.730\nBut if you create a new Keychain, it'll\ncreate a new one encrypted with your new\n\n309\n00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.500\npassword but\nall the old passwords are gone.\n\n310\n00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.500\nThat's usually what we want.\n\n311\n00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.840\nWe want that to be safe.\n\n312\n00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.760\nSo the attacker was able to\nreset Daniel's password, but\n\n313\n00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.890\ndoesn't know enough to\nunlock the Keychain.\n\n314\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.900\nSo he could reset his,\nnow it's an empty Keychain.\n\n315\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.640\nThey'll still have access to\nthe documents folder, right?\n\n316\n00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.610\nThe applications, the other things\nthat are stored on the drive but\n\n317\n00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.220\nnot the Keychain which is good.\n\n318\n00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.900\nAnd, shoot, we saw parental controls\nturned on from the other episode.\n\n319\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.550\nSo Daniel still has some limits there.\n\n320\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:21.880\nBut basically, once he's able to get in,\nnow we've got that access,\n\n321\n00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.950\nso a firmware password really\nwould have helped here.\n\n322\n00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.050\nThat would have stopped this\ntype of activity, right?\n\n323\n00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.330\nSo we wanna make sure you got\na firmware password assigned,\n\n324\n00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.210\ncuz it is super easy to\nreset somebody's password.\n\n325\n00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:36.630\nAnd were this legitimate use, so\nif it were me as an administrator, and\n\n326\n00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:41.140\nI logged in, If I wanted to reset\nsomebody's password like Daniel, right?\n\n327\n00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.330\nSo Daniel comes in and tells me hey,\nDon I forgot my password.\n\n328\n00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.860\nWell instead of booting to recovery\ngoing to that whole process.\n\n329\n00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.120\nI would just go into users and\ngroups and fix it there right?\n\n330\n00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.990\nSo, if I go into system preferences and\nI go into users and groups.\n\n331\n00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.379\nWe can jump in here.\n\n332\n00:15:56.379 --> 00:15:59.889\nI can pick Daniel's account,\nafter I unlock the screen.\n\n333\n00:15:59.889 --> 00:16:01.140\nLet me unlock really quick.\n\n334\n00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.722\nAnd I can take Daniel's, shoot,\nhe's logged in right here.\n\n335\n00:16:05.722 --> 00:16:07.312\nI'll use Christopher Walken as my example.\n\n336\n00:16:07.312 --> 00:16:08.562\nI can choose Christopher Walken and\n\n337\n00:16:08.562 --> 00:16:10.970\nsee I've got that Reset Password\nbutton right there?\n\n338\n00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.270\nI can reset it, and\ntype in a new password.\n\n339\n00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.580\nAnd that's easier than going\ndown the recovery, but\n\n340\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.140\nI would need a valid\nadministrator account.\n\n341\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.350\nSo we have to go to recovery if we forget\nthe administrator account's password.\n\n342\n00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.200\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, it really seems like with\nthat firmware password that we have\n\n343\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.770\nthis giant iron gate with crows nests and\nmachine gun turrets and\n\n344\n00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:28.700\neverything all around it.\n\n345\n00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.070\nAnd we just kind of leave the door open if\nyou're not using that form of password.\n\n346\n00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.510\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah, and\n\n347\n00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.220\nlet me throw in a few other kind of\nconcepts that are kind of similar, right,\n\n348\n00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.360\njust stuff that we need to know is\nthere if we choose to turn it on.\n\n349\n00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.290\nThere's the iCloud account\nthat I mentioned already,\n\n350\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:45.630\nif you tie your account to iCloud that\ngives you another way to reset password,\n\n351\n00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.510\nand you can even store your\nkey chain up in iCloud.\n\n352\n00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:53.630\nWhich is nice, 'cuz if you have maybe have\na MacBook and a Mac Pro, and an iPhone,\n\n353\n00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.810\nyou can synchronize your key chain across\nall of them, and that's kinda nice.\n\n354\n00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.190\nSome people look at the other way and\nsay that's kind of risky.\n\n355\n00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.640\nNow my key chain has always\nbeen in other places but\n\n356\n00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.690\nit's nice to have that little\ncentralized in set up.\n\n357\n00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.640\nIt is actually very secure.\n\n358\n00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.800\nOther things that we can tweak\nwell I mentioned iCloud, right?\n\n359\n00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't connect my account looks\n\n360\n00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.530\nlike I did but you\n&gt;&gt; We didn't attach your account.\n\n361\n00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.487\nSo anybody who wants to do that you can\njust go into system preferences and\n\n362\n00:17:19.487 --> 00:17:20.854\nyou'll see iCloud right there.\n\n363\n00:17:20.854 --> 00:17:23.433\nSo you can click on iCloud and\nyou can link your account and\n\n364\n00:17:23.433 --> 00:17:25.866\nyou can choose what you're\ngoing to be tying into it.\n\n365\n00:17:25.866 --> 00:17:28.443\nAnd you'll see if you scroll down\ninto there here's my key chain.\n\n366\n00:17:28.443 --> 00:17:32.171\n&gt;&gt; And so my keychain is being\nsynchronized into iCloud based on this\n\n367\n00:17:32.171 --> 00:17:33.190\naccount.\n\n368\n00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.580\nIf I took Daniel and\n\n369\n00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.510\nlogged in, he'd click on iCloud and\nit would ask him to log in, right.\n\n370\n00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.450\nAnd that would be the chance to go in and\n\n371\n00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.660\ndo that, under Internet Accounts\nyou have iCloud in here also.\n\n372\n00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.770\nIt's not the same, right?\n\n373\n00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:49.440\nThis is really talking about\nconnecting email and your calendar and\n\n374\n00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.190\nthose things to iCloud,\nnot necessarily the account itself.\n\n375\n00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.960\nSo you do want to make sure you use\nthe iCloud option inside of system\n\n376\n00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.960\npreferences.\n\n377\n00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.730\nWhat else do we have?\n\n378\n00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.500\nFileVault, let's talk about FileVault.\n\n379\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.370\nI'm gonna go a little out\nof order on the notes here.\n\n380\n00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:08.590\nThe firmware password is one part\nof protecting your system but\n\n381\n00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.840\nsomebody could rip the hard drive\nright out of the computer and\n\n382\n00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.070\nadd it as a second hard\ndrive to another computer.\n\n383\n00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.740\nNow there is no firmware anymore.\n\n384\n00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.030\nSo the firmware password doesn't apply,\nright?\n\n385\n00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.355\nSo an added level of security\nis to enable FileVault.\n\n386\n00:18:21.355 --> 00:18:26.180\nFileVault encrypts the entire hard drive,\nso somebody rips the hard drive out,\n\n387\n00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.630\nticks to another computer its\nencrypted it doesn't matter,\n\n388\n00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.052\nit can't do anything, right?\n\n389\n00:18:30.052 --> 00:18:33.242\nYou gonna log in valid account before\nyou can gain access to that system.\n\n390\n00:18:33.242 --> 00:18:35.574\nAnd where gonna see FileVault\nin another episode but\n\n391\n00:18:35.574 --> 00:18:37.710\njust to do it really quickly right here.\n\n392\n00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:42.420\nInside of my system preferences if\nI go into security and privacy.\n\n393\n00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:47.830\nWe can go to the FileVault tab, and\nhere's where we can turn on Filevault.\n\n394\n00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.380\nIt's really easy to turn it on.\n\n395\n00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.130\nYou do need to be an administrator, so\nyou just provide your credentials, and\n\n396\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.760\nthen you hit Turn On FileVault.\n\n397\n00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.110\nIt'll turn it on, it'll give you\na a safety key which you can use\n\n398\n00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.860\nto unencrypt the drive in\ncase you ever get locked out.\n\n399\n00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.150\nAnd then after that it will reboot\nthe system and encrypt the hard drives.\n\n400\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.250\nIt's pretty straight forward process, but\n\n401\n00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.450\nthis ensures that if somebody were\nat physically remove your disk,\n\n402\n00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.780\nyour data is protected, and\nthey're unable to gain access to it.\n\n403\n00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.120\nUnless they have a password for\na valid account on your system.\n\n404\n00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.194\nSo Filevault truly nice.\n\n405\n00:19:17.194 --> 00:19:20.661\nOne thing that might turn up on the exam\nis that there's actually two different\n\n406\n00:19:20.661 --> 00:19:21.800\nversions of FileVault.\n\n407\n00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.850\nThis is FileVault version two.\n\n408\n00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.407\nI know it does [CROSSTALK] but\nit is version two.\n\n409\n00:19:25.407 --> 00:19:28.461\nFileVault version one is no\nlonger supported by Apple but\n\n410\n00:19:28.461 --> 00:19:30.210\nit is called Legacy FileVault.\n\n411\n00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.270\nAnd the way it works is it only\nencrypted your home directory.\n\n412\n00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.630\nSo like slash users slash center or\nwhatever.\n\n413\n00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.790\nIt would only encrypt your home directory.\n\n414\n00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.440\nAnd the problem there was there\nwere certain ways to bypass it.\n\n415\n00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.240\nThat really wasn't good.\n\n416\n00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.800\nSo in FileVault version two,\nit encrypts the entire hard drive.\n\n417\n00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.710\nThe only time you'll see\nFileVault version one anymore is\n\n418\n00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.450\nif you have a system that's been\nupgraded over and over and over again.\n\n419\n00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.220\nSo maybe you were running snow leopard.\n\n420\n00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.380\nI know a really old while back.\n\n421\n00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.950\n&gt;&gt; And you've upgraded a few times and\nnever upgraded to FileVault.\n\n422\n00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.760\nIf that's the case when you come here,\n\n423\n00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.080\nyou actually see another tab\nthat we'll say legacy FileVault.\n\n424\n00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.220\nAnd it gives you one option and that's to\nunencrypt to turn off legacy file vault.\n\n425\n00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.580\nAnd what Apple recommends you do is\nyou turn off legacy FileVault and\n\n426\n00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.960\nthen you jump over to the regular\nFileVault tab and turn it on and that will\n\n427\n00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.960\nunencrypt your home directory and then\nit will encrypt the entire hard drive.\n\n428\n00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.250\nThat's the better way to go about it.\n\n429\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.920\nSo you really don't want to be running\nlegacy FileVault if you can avoid it\n\n430\n00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.380\nyou really need to turn that off and\nturn on the new FileVault.\n\n431\n00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.480\nNow Don, we made a couple of jokes about\nthe key chain kinda storing our passwords.\n\n432\n00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.700\nWe do have concern about\nprivacy though and\n\n433\n00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.290\nthose are some controls that we\nalso have inside of our Mac OS.\n\n434\n00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.520\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah and that's really\nthe last thing we need to cover here,\n\n435\n00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.740\nis if I jump over to the privacy tab.\n\n436\n00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.480\nHere's where you can dictate things like\nwhether you want to have location services\n\n437\n00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.490\nturned on.\n\n438\n00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.880\nAnd Location Services,\nif you go to a website and\n\n439\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.380\nyou've allowed this,\nthey can actually determine where you are?\n\n440\n00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.720\nAnd that sounds like a bad thing, right?\n\n441\n00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.720\nThere is a good side,\nthe Location Services, though.\n\n442\n00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.850\nAnd that is, what happens if\nyou lose your laptop, right?\n\n443\n00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:08.160\nWell, as part of iCloud,\nyou can turn on Find My Mac.\n\n444\n00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.410\nFind My Mac is where anytime your\nlaptop connects to a wireless network,\n\n445\n00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.030\nit'll phone home to apple to try\nto identify were the thing is.\n\n446\n00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.300\nAnd having things like locations services,\nwill allow you to be able do that,\n\n447\n00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.740\nto be able to track where your device is\nand find it if it gets lost or stolen.\n\n448\n00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.050\nBut its also useful to go\nto a weather website and\n\n449\n00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.490\nthen just automatically choose your\nweather for your local area area, right?\n\n450\n00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.200\nSo that kinda in the other side, but you\ndo have control over what get shared out.\n\n451\n00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.920\nSo back under security and\nprivacy you can see or\n\n452\n00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.840\nwe can choose who gets access\nto Location Services, right?\n\n453\n00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:43.560\nI want Safari or Siri or whoever that\nhave that access, we can dictate that.\n\n454\n00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.820\nSame thing with contacts,\ncalendars and so on.\n\n455\n00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.040\nYou can dictate what's\nallowed to see what?\n\n456\n00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.940\nThe one you really wanna be\ncarefully with is accessibility.\n\n457\n00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:56.220\nApplications that have accessibility\naccess are able to intercept keystrokes on\n\n458\n00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.870\nyour keyboard right as well as record\nwhat's going on on the screen and\n\n459\n00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:01.080\nall sorts of things like that.\n\n460\n00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.750\nThey normally do it for good reasons.\n\n461\n00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.560\nSo for example I use Flash Top.\n\n462\n00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.420\nFlash Top lets me remotely\nview my laptop screen,\n\n463\n00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.730\ncuz sometimes I leave my\nlaptop here at the office.\n\n464\n00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.950\nAnd I'm at home, and I say I really need\nto get this document off my laptop, so\n\n465\n00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:16.650\nI'll remote in using Splashtop and\nsee my screen, that's good, right.\n\n466\n00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:20.730\nBut an attacker can leverage that\nto be able to see my screen, and\n\n467\n00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.430\nthey have that advance level interaction.\n\n468\n00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:25.860\nSo any applications you\nadd under accessibility\n\n469\n00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.820\nneed to be applications that you really,\nreally trust.\n\n470\n00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:32.300\nRight, if you don't trust an application\nit shouldn't be turned on in here\n\n471\n00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:36.420\nbecause it's getting access as well beyond\nwhat a normal application would have.\n\n472\n00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, well definitely\na lot of errors in which we can\n\n473\n00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.630\nexhibit some controls, some privacy.\n\n474\n00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:42.701\nWe have concerns on security.\n\n475\n00:22:42.701 --> 00:22:46.930\nA lot areas in that that we take a look\nat definitely be using these things.\n\n476\n00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.460\nIf you like I said you get that\niron gate right at the beginning\n\n477\n00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:54.110\nthat can actually keep a lot\nof malfeasance from happening\n\n478\n00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:56.320\nif you just enable a firmware password,\nright?\n\n479\n00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.170\nAnd then of course if we ever lose those\nthings we have countermeasures for that so\n\n480\n00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.910\nwe can get back into our systems.\n\n481\n00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.584\nApple doesn't want us to be locked\nout forever and a day, right?\n\n482\n00:23:03.584 --> 00:23:05.895\nEven though they're selling\nour credentials on SIlk Road.\n\n483\n00:23:05.895 --> 00:23:09.106\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Leave that to the side they don't care\n\n484\n00:23:09.106 --> 00:23:11.340\nabout that,\njust pay attention to what we tell you to.\n\n485\n00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.864\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Don, thank you for\n\n486\n00:23:13.864 --> 00:23:17.832\ngiving us some of the ways in which\nwe can help secure ourselves and\n\n487\n00:23:17.832 --> 00:23:21.529\nour systems inside of Mac OS,\nbut I'm looking at our clock.\n\n488\n00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:24.977\nIt looks like we're about that time for\nus to call it a day, at least for\n\n489\n00:23:24.977 --> 00:23:26.430\nthis episode, anyway.\n\n490\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.980\nWe do thank you good folks for watching,\n\n491\n00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:31.360\nbut signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n492\n00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.210\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n493\n00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:33.459\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n494\n00:23:33.459 --> 00:23:39.508\n[MUSIC]\n\n495\n00:23:39.508 --> 00:23:42.365\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching, ITProTV\n\n",

00:00:08.425\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:11.991\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:16.393\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode right\nhere on ITProTV, you're watching the Apple\n\n6\n00:00:16.393 --> 00:00:20.710\ncertified support professional from\nMac OS Sierra I'm you host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.717\nAnd today, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at file storage.\n\n8\n00:00:22.717 --> 00:00:25.720\nAnd helping us out is gonna be,\nwell, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.638\nDon, welcome back to our studios.\n\n10\n00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:27.877\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:32.800\nAnd this is a pretty neat topic because\nfiles, they've been around a while, right?\n\n12\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.330\nAnd there's certain aspects of files that\nhaven't really changed since the very\n\n13\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.140\nearly days of Mac OS.\n\n14\n00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.580\nBut there are a lot of new\nthings some advanced features,\n\n15\n00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.720\nsome security concerns, and\nother things that we need to be aware of.\n\n16\n00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.017\nSo in this episode, and really over\nthe next two or three episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:47.017 --> 00:00:50.503\nWe're gonna be talking about some of\nthe different file storage options,\n\n18\n00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:53.214\nthe way the files are handled\nby the operating system, and\n\n19\n00:00:53.214 --> 00:00:56.450\nsome of the security procedures that\nwe have the center around them.\n\n20\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.414\nSo quite a bit of stuff, but\nit is important, cuz it is foundational\n\n21\n00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:03.008\nknowledge and it affects every single user\nthat makes use of an operating system.\n\n22\n00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:06.215\n&gt;&gt; All right so, Don, what are some of\nthe different types of storage that we're\n\n23\n00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:08.410\nreally talking about when\nwe're working with this?\n\n24\n00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.700\n&gt;&gt; okay so we've got two\nprimary categories of storage.\n\n25\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.870\nThere's internal and external.\n\n26\n00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.171\nWhen you buy a Mac, well,\nif you buy it today,\n\n27\n00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:19.786\nyou're gonna have internal storage\nthat's generally fixed storage.\n\n28\n00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:22.721\nIt's soldered onto the mother board\nyou really can't do anything about it.\n\n29\n00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:27.521\nSome of the larger Macs like the Mac Pros\nactually do have a changeable internal\n\n30\n00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:29.061\nstorage or expandable.\n\n31\n00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:32.299\nWe can add more or\nget different configurations inside of it.\n\n32\n00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.910\nBut either way, that storage is designed\nto always be inside the computer.\n\n33\n00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.890\nIt's not something you pop\nout from time to time,\n\n34\n00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.640\nit stays in the computer all the time.\n\n35\n00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.230\nVersus external storage or\n\n36\n00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.600\nremovable storage, which is designed\nto be there some of the time, right?\n\n37\n00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.071\nWe can add it when we need it, take it out\nwhen we don't need it, it comes and goes.\n\n38\n00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:54.277\nNow on the internal storage side,\n\n39\n00:01:54.277 --> 00:01:58.697\nthere's really only two types of\nstorage that we see on modern Macs.\n\n40\n00:01:58.697 --> 00:02:02.315\nSo when you go and publish one right now,\nit's typically going to be a hard drive,\n\n41\n00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:03.312\nand with hard drives,\n\n42\n00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:06.530\nthere's two types of hard drives\neverything's gonna be in twos today.\n\n43\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.562\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we've got HDs,\n\n44\n00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:15.140\ntraditional spinning disks, and we've\ngot SSDs, or solid-state digital drives.\n\n45\n00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.130\nAnd these two disks,\nthey show up the same for an end user.\n\n46\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.371\nWhen an end user looks at their operating\nsystem, they see Macintosh HD, and\n\n47\n00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:26.520\nthey don't necessarily know if it's SSD or\nan older style HDD.\n\n48\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.086\nAnd where they might notice\nis simply in the speed.\n\n49\n00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:33.440\nSSD is the newer technology it's very,\nvery fast.\n\n50\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.580\nHDDs is the older technologies,\nand they're not terribly fast.\n\n51\n00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.720\nThey were fast 20 years ago, but\n\n52\n00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.100\ntimes have changed quite a bit and\nthey aren't fast anymore.\n\n53\n00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.982\nSo let's kinda cover what\nthe basics are on those.\n\n54\n00:02:44.982 --> 00:02:49.543\nA HDD or a hard disk drive is\na traditional spinning disk.\n\n55\n00:02:49.543 --> 00:02:52.603\nIf you were to take one of these\nthings and crack them open,\n\n56\n00:02:52.603 --> 00:02:56.168\nthey've got these little platters,\nthese metal well, circles?\n\n57\n00:02:56.168 --> 00:02:56.996\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n58\n00:02:56.996 --> 00:02:58.433\n&gt;&gt; They spin, kind of,\nkind of like a record in a record player,\n\n59\n00:02:58.433 --> 00:02:59.389\nif you remember what a record player is.\n\n60\n00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:00.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n61\n00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.370\n&gt;&gt; And so they, they spin.\n\n62\n00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.150\nAnd it reads the data right off\nof there by using electricity.\n\n63\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.900\nIt's all, all stored with\nmagnetic pulses that are kind of\n\n64\n00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.620\nwritten to the disk as ones and\nzeros, it can be read back.\n\n65\n00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.210\nThe technology is sound,\nit works very well.\n\n66\n00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.750\nBut it's not very fast,\nbecause you have a spinning disk.\n\n67\n00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.956\nAnd there's a mechanical arm that\nhas to move to read that disk and\n\n68\n00:03:18.956 --> 00:03:21.240\nit takes time for\nthat mechanical arm to move.\n\n69\n00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.200\nYou've got a physical motor also.\n\n70\n00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.150\nAnd that means that over time,\nthat disk is going to wear out.\n\n71\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.040\nAnd it's rare that you get more than three\nto four years of lifetime out of one\n\n72\n00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.048\nof these spinning disks.\n\n73\n00:03:31.048 --> 00:03:33.580\nThere are some that will go much,\nmuch longer.\n\n74\n00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.950\nBut it's really iffy beyond\nthree to four years.\n\n75\n00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.930\nSolid state drives, on the other hand,\ndo away with the spinning disk.\n\n76\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.720\nThey do away with the mechanical arm and\nthe motor.\n\n77\n00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.090\nThey do away with all that.\n\n78\n00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.930\nAnd instead, have microchips on there\nthat we can store data through.\n\n79\n00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.470\nThey have flash memory on them.\n\n80\n00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.200\nNow, flash memory used to\nbe incredibly expensive and\n\n81\n00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.190\nit used to be incredibly hot.\n\n82\n00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.640\nBut that technology has advanced a lot.\n\n83\n00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.233\nAnd now it can actually run pretty\ncool and it's far less expensive.\n\n84\n00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:02.630\nIt's still not cheap, right?\n\n85\n00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.290\nWe're not got out and\n\n86\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.990\nbuy a ton of SSD storage on any given day\nunless you're, well, with the government.\n\n87\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.006\nBut for most of us,\nwe have a budget to worry about and so\n\n88\n00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:12.718\nWe get the amount that we need.\n\n89\n00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:16.251\nThe nice thing about SSD is\nthat it's incredibly fast.\n\n90\n00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:18.350\nWe don't have to spin a disk.\n\n91\n00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.390\nWe don't have to move an arm to\na particular location to read data.\n\n92\n00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.124\nWe can just jump right to the cell\nthat stores the data we need.\n\n93\n00:04:24.124 --> 00:04:28.830\nWe can read, get it back and\nmove on with our lives very fast, right?\n\n94\n00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.857\nSo SSD is fast.\n\n95\n00:04:29.857 --> 00:04:33.362\nAnd when you go and buy a Mac today.\n\n96\n00:04:33.362 --> 00:04:38.547\nMost of them either, only support SSD or\nhave SSD chosen as the default,\n\n97\n00:04:38.547 --> 00:04:42.727\nand you can flip back to HDDs or\neven a hybrid disk, right.\n\n98\n00:04:42.727 --> 00:04:47.634\nThe hybrid disks, those kinda came in\nwhen Apple called them fusion drives, and\n\n99\n00:04:47.634 --> 00:04:50.970\nthe way a fusion drive worked is,\ntwo different ways.\n\n100\n00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.720\nThey were many that came\nwith actually two disks.\n\n101\n00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.800\nOne was one an SSD and one was an HTD.\n\n102\n00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.060\nSSD are pretty expensive in the beginning\nso you might get an eight gigabyte SSD\n\n103\n00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.310\nfive hundred gig HTD\nright a much bigger one.\n\n104\n00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.633\nAnd your most frequently access\nfile we get cached to that SSD so\n\n105\n00:05:09.633 --> 00:05:10.581\nit would be fast.\n\n106\n00:05:10.581 --> 00:05:14.093\nAnd then your infrequently accessed\nfiles will be in your regular disk so\n\n107\n00:05:14.093 --> 00:05:15.600\nthat would be slower, right?\n\n108\n00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.700\nThen they eventually merge those together.\n\n109\n00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.801\nSo it was a single HDD that had some\nflash memory so to write inside of it.\n\n110\n00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:27.850\nAnd then ultimately the SDD prices came\ndown enough with they phase that out.\n\n111\n00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.750\nAnd so now when you're going to Apple site\nthe majority time you look You're just\n\n112\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.218\nseeing traditional HTDs and SSDs, and\nmost of the time your just seeing SSDs.\n\n113\n00:05:37.218 --> 00:05:39.620\nAll right, so if I go and\nbuy an SSD today,\n\n114\n00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.110\nthen why do I care about the other stuff?\n\n115\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.787\nThe reason is you're supporting Macs,\n\n116\n00:05:42.787 --> 00:05:45.955\nyou might have Macs that you're deploying\nthat could be several years old.\n\n117\n00:05:45.955 --> 00:05:49.227\nAnd they very well may support\nmultiple storage types, so\n\n118\n00:05:49.227 --> 00:05:51.850\nbe aware of those\ndifferent types of storage.\n\n119\n00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.810\nOn the internal side, you're really\njust gonna see SSD as the new stuff.\n\n120\n00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.180\nBut as you get back,\neven just a couple of years,\n\n121\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.000\nyou'll start to find systems\nthat only have HDD, right?\n\n122\n00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.020\nThe Mac Mini that I was using on the show,\nin a previous episode.\n\n123\n00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.751\nThat Mac Mini had a traditional\nspinning HDD in it, not SSD.\n\n124\n00:06:09.751 --> 00:06:13.070\nNow, we've got another Mac Mini around\nhere somewhere that actually has SSD.\n\n125\n00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.223\nAnd so, there's different ones,\ndifferent configurations.\n\n126\n00:06:15.223 --> 00:06:18.932\nIt doesn't necessarily affect us except\nfor in performance, right the SSD is much,\n\n127\n00:06:18.932 --> 00:06:19.960\nmuch faster.\n\n128\n00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.333\nNow if we go back to even a few more years\nand get a stand alone device you may\n\n129\n00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:27.876\nalso have an optical disk,\nlike a DVD or CD drive, right.\n\n130\n00:06:27.876 --> 00:06:31.812\nOr in Apple's world we normally have\nwhat's called the super drive and\n\n131\n00:06:31.812 --> 00:06:34.115\nthe super drive can burn CDs and DVDs and,\n\n132\n00:06:34.115 --> 00:06:37.450\n[COUGH] Do it all in one\nkinda nice component.\n\n133\n00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.570\nThose disks have become far less common,\n\n134\n00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.670\nin fact you can't get iMacs\nwith optical disks anymore,\n\n135\n00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.530\nyou can't get MacBooks or Mac Pros none\nof them come with optical disks anymore.\n\n136\n00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.245\nInstead, they have a USB\nconnected super drive, so\n\n137\n00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.168\nyou can add it as an external device.\n\n138\n00:06:54.168 --> 00:06:58.020\nThe drive itself kinda becomes removable\nstorage, right, so that's what we see.\n\n139\n00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.880\nAnd most people don't even buy those\nanymore because most people instead of\n\n140\n00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.010\nburning CDs and DVDs instead just use\nthings like flash thumb drives, right.\n\n141\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.830\nYou pop on a quick 16 gigs of memory or\nhow ever much you need and\n\n142\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.920\nstore your data there and off you go.\n\n143\n00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.982\nSo actually I'm looking behind me and\n\n144\n00:07:13.982 --> 00:07:18.102\nif you look right where\nthe ITProTV little logo is.\n\n145\n00:07:18.102 --> 00:07:22.980\nRight behind it there's an iMac back there\nthat powers, there's a monitor out in\n\n146\n00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.810\nour front lobby that shows a video,\nit just plays a video 24 hours a day.\n\n147\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.969\nAnd so that little, I'm gonna try\nto point, this guy right here,\n\n148\n00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:36.814\nthat's a Mac Mini and you can actually\nsee the CD tray built into the top of it.\n\n149\n00:07:36.814 --> 00:07:42.117\nThat is the original Mac Mini,\nthat thing has to be I don't know.\n\n150\n00:07:42.117 --> 00:07:44.350\nIt's probably six or\nseven years old, right?\n\n151\n00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.052\nIf you get a new MAC mini it doesn;t\nhave that optimal disk on the top of it\n\n152\n00:07:48.052 --> 00:07:48.620\nanymore.\n\n153\n00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.235\nThey just lopped that off and made it\nshorter and so it's a smaller footprint.\n\n154\n00:07:51.235 --> 00:07:52.609\nYou don't need that optimal disk.\n\n155\n00:07:52.609 --> 00:07:57.229\nSo, be aware that there's people, people\nlike us, like me right here where I've\n\n156\n00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:00.605\ngot this device in the background and\nut's purpose driven.\n\n157\n00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:04.287\nAll it's doing is playing one video,\nover and over and over, 24 hours a day.\n\n158\n00:08:04.287 --> 00:08:07.420\nThey'll throw it on some\nmonitor here in our building.\n\n159\n00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.960\nAnd so you'll find things like that.\n\n160\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.850\nAnd that's where we need\nto be aware of storage that\n\n161\n00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.870\ninternal to a device like that.\n\n162\n00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.230\nOkay now, if you took a look at my laptop.\n\n163\n00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.827\nMy laptop here, I have a hard drive on it,\nright, there's Macintosh HD.\n\n164\n00:08:22.827 --> 00:08:28.460\nAnd when I look at that I don't\nnecessarily know if it's an HDD or SSD.\n\n165\n00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.780\nI don't know if it's a spinning disk or\nSSD.\n\n166\n00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.760\nWell, I mean, I can go and\npull my invoice and I would know.\n\n167\n00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.190\nOr I'm the one who had to buy the thing so\nI know what it is.\n\n168\n00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.510\nBut if you don't know, if you sit down and\nyou look at look at it.\n\n169\n00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.540\nWell, you don't see it right away.\n\n170\n00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.960\nIf you go into your Apple menu and\ngo to About this Mac, and\n\n171\n00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.390\nyou pull this up,it really doesn't tell\nyou much about the storage, right?\n\n172\n00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.110\nWe see memory, we see CPU and all that.\n\n173\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.550\nBut if we go into our system report,\nin your system report you can actually\n\n174\n00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.340\nfigure out a little bit\nmore about that storage and\n\n175\n00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.460\nyou can identify in here whether or\nnot it's SSD.\n\n176\n00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.610\nBecause you'll see the ATA bus,\nand a few of the other things.\n\n177\n00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.770\nActually, Serial ATA bus is\nwhat I'm looking for, this guy.\n\n178\n00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.380\nAnd under my Serial ATA bus,\nit'll show the physical disks attached.\n\n179\n00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.410\nAnd here I can see,\nApple SSD Controller, and\n\n180\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.240\nI can see the information about my drive.\n\n181\n00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.560\nI've got a 500 GB Apple SSD\npowering my laptop.\n\n182\n00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.960\nSo I know that mine has\nsolid state digital.\n\n183\n00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.947\nMine doesn't have a spinning disk or HDD.\n\n184\n00:09:27.947 --> 00:09:29.563\nAll right, so you can identify that.\n\n185\n00:09:29.563 --> 00:09:31.350\nIt just takes a little bit of digging.\n\n186\n00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.337\nI'll show you in the disk\nutility a little bit later.\n\n187\n00:09:33.337 --> 00:09:34.530\nIt's even easier there.\n\n188\n00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.260\nSo the disk utility is where I'd\nnormally go to find this, but\n\n189\n00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.365\nthe system utility, the system\nreport here gives us the same data.\n\n190\n00:09:42.365 --> 00:09:46.380\nAll right,\ninternal storage is one thing, right?\n\n191\n00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.240\nWhen you buy your laptop or\nyou buy your desktop,\n\n192\n00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.820\nit's gonna come with internal storage.\n\n193\n00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.780\nBut external storage is another.\n\n194\n00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.539\nAnd with external storage,\n\n195\n00:09:54.539 --> 00:09:58.140\nyou can buy this at any pont in\nthe lifetime of your device.\n\n196\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.610\nAnd where we really see this the most\nis probably with Time Machine.\n\n197\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.320\nWith Time Machine, I wanna back up to\na disk, but I don't want the disc to be\n\n198\n00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.590\ninside of my laptop because what\nhappens if I lose my laptop?\n\n199\n00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.280\nI just lost my backup too.\n\n200\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.480\nSo we're gonna use things\nlike removable storage.\n\n201\n00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.610\nAnd you'll see on my desktop here\nthat I've got that Macintosh HD and\n\n202\n00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.120\nit's got the nice little icon that shows\nthat it is a supported hard drive.\n\n203\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.180\nAnd then right below that I've\ngot this untitled one, right.\n\n204\n00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.560\nAnd the Untitled one has the yellow\nicon that indicates an external drive,\n\n205\n00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.940\neither Thunderbolt or USB.\n\n206\n00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.600\nYou can plug in external storage to\nyour laptop via a number of different\n\n207\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.760\nports to gain access to it, right.\n\n208\n00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.000\nThe one we're seeing here,\nlet me just eject this real quick.\n\n209\n00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.910\nIs my little\nWestern Digital Elements drive.\n\n210\n00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.560\nIt's a one terabyte disk.\n\n211\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.310\nAnd it is a spinning\ndisk that it's not SSDs.\n\n212\n00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:53.440\nSo this is a spinning disk and\nthe reason I didn't do SSD on this one\n\n213\n00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.140\nis because spinning disk are super,\nsuper cheap.\n\n214\n00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.990\nAnd this is a terabyte of storage and\nI think you can get it for like $40 now.\n\n215\n00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.610\nSo really, really cheap.\n\n216\n00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.650\nAnd it's perfect for things like\ntime machine or temporary storage.\n\n217\n00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.335\nI might need to give a large\namount of files to run, so\n\n218\n00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:11.586\nI can plug this hard drive into my laptop,\ncopy the files to it.\n\n219\n00:11:11.586 --> 00:11:14.621\nAnd then, give the hard drive to\nRonnie and he can plug it into his and\n\n220\n00:11:14.621 --> 00:11:15.750\nhe can get the files.\n\n221\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.070\nReally easy to quickly transmit files.\n\n222\n00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.750\nAnd these kind of things are cheap,\nthey're easily replaced and\n\n223\n00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.860\nyou can expand the storage on\nyour device very, very quickly.\n\n224\n00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.394\nYou lose a little bit of convenience,\nportability.\n\n225\n00:11:27.394 --> 00:11:27.909\nIf I wanna go and\n\n226\n00:11:27.909 --> 00:11:30.430\nmove from office to office I've\ngot to take this drive with me.\n\n227\n00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.170\nBut, if I'm buying something\nlike a A MacBook Air and\n\n228\n00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.740\njust get 128 gig SSD in it,\nnot a ton of storage.\n\n229\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.760\nI can then have a terabyte drive like\nthis that is available when I need it\n\n230\n00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.020\nto have that extra storage,\nwe can easily tack that on, all right.\n\n231\n00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.790\nNow as far as how we add storage,\nthere's a ton of different ways.\n\n232\n00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.540\nAnd Apple's actually been addressing\nthis in their newer devices.\n\n233\n00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.120\nSo if you take a laptop like mine,\n\n234\n00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.230\nmine has a ton of ports\naround the outside of it.\n\n235\n00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.540\nAnd actually, Ronnie, I think no,\nyours is newer than mine, but\n\n236\n00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.310\neven yours has a ton of ports on it,\nright.\n\n237\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.660\n&gt;&gt; And so if I wanna add external storage,\nI've got a lot of choices.\n\n238\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.120\nSo many choices,\nthat Apple finally said, you know what?\n\n239\n00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.480\nWe need to fix this.\n\n240\n00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.490\nAnd on the newest version of my laptop,\n\n241\n00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:20.130\nthe newest MacBook Pro, there's only one\ntype of port, so it's called a USBC port.\n\n242\n00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:26.060\nAnd USBC is becoming a universal port that\ncan be used for darn near everything.\n\n243\n00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.360\nBut on every other Mac manufactured today,\nwell,\n\n244\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.800\nand this obviously depends on\nwhen you watch this video.\n\n245\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.830\nSo we're filming this here in May of 2017.\n\n246\n00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.050\nSo up to this point,\nonly the MacBook Pro and\n\n247\n00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.000\nthe MacBook Air have been\nupdated to just be USB-C.\n\n248\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.800\nOver time, we'll see other things\nlike the Mac minis and Mac Pros and\n\n249\n00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.180\nthe over devices start to go USB-C also.\n\n250\n00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:52.130\nBut on anything manufactured prior to this\ndate, you had a plethora of ports, right?\n\n251\n00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.880\nA virtual cornucopia of ports.\n\n252\n00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.510\nAnd Apple put a slide out,\nin their last presentation.\n\n253\n00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:59.190\nThis was the slide they\nused in their show.\n\n254\n00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.490\nWhere they demonstrated that on a laptop\nlike mine, I've got power, right?\n\n255\n00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.520\nSo I've got the little, what's it called?\n\n256\n00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.760\nMagsafe, I've got the magsafe connector,\nthat can pop on and pop off really easy.\n\n257\n00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.350\nI've got USB ports, so I've got USB\n3 ports on each side of my laptop,\n\n258\n00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:20.280\nyou've got, what they've labeled\nhere is display, display ports.\n\n259\n00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:25.160\nAnd the display ports on most Macs\nactually double as Thunderbolt ports also,\n\n260\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.900\nand I'll talk about thunder\nbolt here in a moment.\n\n261\n00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.590\nWell, I ain't gonna talk\nabout thunder bolt right now.\n\n262\n00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.080\nThunder bolt is not a part.\n\n263\n00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.230\nA lot of people confuse this.\n\n264\n00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.020\nThunderbolt is a protocol.\n\n265\n00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.860\nIt's a protocol for\ncommunicating very, very fast.\n\n266\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.500\nAnd it does a great job.\n\n267\n00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.310\nIt is the highest speed connection\nyou get when you plug into these\n\n268\n00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.510\ndevices these days.\n\n269\n00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.560\nSo Thunderbolt's really impressive.\n\n270\n00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.220\nAnd when they first rolled it out,\nlike on my laptop\n\n271\n00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.760\nthe Thunderbolt ports were lined\nup with a display port connector.\n\n272\n00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.860\nSo what they're showing here\non the side is a Display port.\n\n273\n00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.800\nNormally we would attach\na monitor with that.\n\n274\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.510\nBut you can attach other devices.\n\n275\n00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.330\nLike Ronny has a Thunderbolt hard drive.\n\n276\n00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.360\nHe plugs in into his laptop and\nhe uses that port.\n\n277\n00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.960\nIt would look just like a Display port,\nexcept of the lighting both sides And\n\n278\n00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.450\nthat's how you know that\nit supports Thunderbolt.\n\n279\n00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.980\nIf there's no lightening bolt on it,\nthen it only supports monitors,\n\n280\n00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.350\nit only supports displays, but,\notherwise, it's the same connector.\n\n281\n00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.800\nThere's HDMI.\n\n282\n00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.270\nHDMI just does video, that's all it does.\n\n283\n00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:18.930\nIt doesn't also do Thunderbolt.\n\n284\n00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.030\nAnd then, some Macs still have VGA,\nmine doesn't but\n\n285\n00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:26.370\nsome do, where they can connect\nwith traditional VGA Monitor.\n\n286\n00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:31.430\nMost systems don't support that anymore,\nVGA is pretty much extinct at this point.\n\n287\n00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.120\nYou do see some laptops\nthat still have it.\n\n288\n00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.510\nAnd you'll go to a hotel to do\na presentation and it'll have a projector.\n\n289\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.640\nAnd that's what they support.\n\n290\n00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.230\nBut it's all old stuff.\n\n291\n00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.780\nBut on the new laptops,\nyou don't have all these different ports.\n\n292\n00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.700\nYou just have this guy,\nUSB-C And that's it.\n\n293\n00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.370\nAnd it's nice because you can plug your\npower, your charger into that USB-C port.\n\n294\n00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.470\nYou can plug your storage into\nthat USB-C port, your printers,\n\n295\n00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.490\nyour monitors,\nwhatever it is that you have.\n\n296\n00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.640\nYou can plug right into that.\n\n297\n00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.720\nAnd it runs the DisplayPort protocol,\nit runs the Thunderbolt protocol.\n\n298\n00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.810\nIt runs each of these different\nways of communicating so\n\n299\n00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.630\nit's one port that can\nserve more than one role.\n\n300\n00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.830\nIf I have a hard drive, like this one?\n\n301\n00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.966\nWell, when I bought this hard drive,\nit's USB 3.0.\n\n302\n00:15:10.966 --> 00:15:14.610\nSo it's got a traditional USB\n3.0 connector on it, right?\n\n303\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.680\nWell, this is technically what, USB 3.0,\n\n304\n00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.360\nkind of like Thunderbolt,\nis a protocol, not a port, right?\n\n305\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.320\nSo just because this is USB 3.0,\n\n306\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.140\nIt doesn't mean this is\na USB 3.0 connector, right?\n\n307\n00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.030\nThe connector itself actually has a name.\n\n308\n00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.360\nYou remember the name?\n\n309\n00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.157\nUSB Type B, something like that.\n\n310\n00:15:34.157 --> 00:15:37.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's type B,\na type B connector and\n\n311\n00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.760\n[COUGH] it's designed to plug\ninto a host like my laptop.\n\n312\n00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.460\nWhat would USB C,\nit's talking about the connector and\n\n313\n00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.650\nUSB C is actually USB 3.1 for\nthe protocol.\n\n314\n00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.956\nSo it's easy to confuse those,\nthe protocol versus the port.\n\n315\n00:15:50.956 --> 00:15:53.128\nAnd, so, I don't have to\nthrow this hard drive away.\n\n316\n00:15:53.128 --> 00:15:58.171\nIf I get a new Mac that has only USB-C\nports I can just pop this cable off.\n\n317\n00:15:58.171 --> 00:15:58.750\nRight?\n\n318\n00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.821\nAnd get a different cable so\n\n319\n00:16:00.821 --> 00:16:06.051\nthat on this end is the regular\nconnector here, that is a hard drive.\n\n320\n00:16:06.051 --> 00:16:08.306\nAnd on the other end it will be USB-C.\n\n321\n00:16:08.306 --> 00:16:10.163\nAnd then I'd be able to plug in that port.\n\n322\n00:16:10.163 --> 00:16:12.441\nAnd it won't run to use the 3.1 speeds.\n\n323\n00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:16.000\nIt'll run at USB 3.0 speeds\ncuz it's a USB 3.0 drive.\n\n324\n00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.780\nBut just remember that the protocol\nis different than the physical port.\n\n325\n00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.990\nAnd you can easily swap out a cable or\nthey even make a little adapter so\n\n326\n00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.870\nyou can pop on the end and\nturn it into USB-C cable.\n\n327\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.620\nThat works too and\nthen you can add it on in.\n\n328\n00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.170\nAnd that was a bit of the controversy\nwhen the new devices came out.\n\n329\n00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.130\nIs that they called it is,\nwas it Dongle Gate or whatever,\n\n330\n00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.600\nwhere you buy this nice shiny new laptop,\nand\n\n331\n00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.440\nthen you've got to buy ten dongles\nto get all your equipment to work.\n\n332\n00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.740\nAnd that's true today, but what you'll\nfind over the next two to three years,\n\n333\n00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.160\nyou're gonna start replacing your devices.\n\n334\n00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.074\nAnd as you replace those devices,\nmore and more of them will go to USB-C.\n\n335\n00:16:51.074 --> 00:16:55.190\nSo he new iPhones are supposed\nto have USB-C ports on them.\n\n336\n00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.250\nThe new iPads didn't, so\nI don't know what's going on there.\n\n337\n00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.080\nBut eventually the iPads will go and\nhave USB-C.\n\n338\n00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.310\nYou'll start finding more and\n\n339\n00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:05.590\nmore devices move over to USB-C, and\nthen it won't be a controversy anymore.\n\n340\n00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:12.560\nAll right, so on removable storage,\nI mentioned hard drives.\n\n341\n00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.733\nAnd we talked about USB,\nprobably too much.\n\n342\n00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:17.098\nTalked about Thunderbolt, CD and DVD.\n\n343\n00:17:17.098 --> 00:17:20.420\nWe already talked about FireWire.\n\n344\n00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.681\nI don't think any of the current\nMac lineup comes with FireWire.\n\n345\n00:17:23.681 --> 00:17:26.214\nEven the Mac Pro, I don't think\nthere's FireWire ports anymore.\n\n346\n00:17:26.214 --> 00:17:27.900\nYou can add them, but it doesn't have it.\n\n347\n00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.535\nFireWire used to be the hotness, right?\n\n348\n00:17:30.535 --> 00:17:33.250\nIt used to be the fast way to move\nstuff before Thunderbolt completely\n\n349\n00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:34.230\nkilled it overnight.\n\n350\n00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.820\nSo normally, we're gonna use\nThunderbolt for really fast storage.\n\n351\n00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:41.020\nBut you might still has\nsome Legacy FireWire stuff.\n\n352\n00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.532\nI think we have FireWire drive\nlaying around here somewhere.\n\n353\n00:17:43.532 --> 00:17:45.172\nAnd the fact that I don't even\nknow where it is says something.\n\n354\n00:17:45.172 --> 00:17:47.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But for our editing stations,\n\n355\n00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.239\nwe actually had to add a little FireWire\nadapted to get that to connect in.\n\n356\n00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:54.605\nThey do make Thunderbolt\nto FireWire adapters, so\n\n357\n00:17:54.605 --> 00:17:56.042\nyou can add port if you need it.\n\n358\n00:17:56.042 --> 00:17:57.983\nBut most of us aren't gonna\nhave to support that anymore.\n\n359\n00:17:57.983 --> 00:18:01.298\nWhere you might bump into it though is\nwhere somebody somebody does have an old\n\n360\n00:18:01.298 --> 00:18:03.243\ndrive and\nthey need to get some data off of it.\n\n361\n00:18:03.243 --> 00:18:06.256\nAnd if you wanna do that, you either\nneed to have an old Mac laying around or\n\n362\n00:18:06.256 --> 00:18:08.013\none of those adapters, like I mentioned.\n\n363\n00:18:08.013 --> 00:18:10.226\nAnd you can do Thunderbolt to FireWire.\n\n364\n00:18:10.226 --> 00:18:15.560\nAll right, now as we add these disks,\n\n365\n00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.280\nas we plug them in to the system, we\nneed to start making use of them, right?\n\n366\n00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.159\nAnd when we make use of them, there's\nsome terminology that I wanna cover and\n\n367\n00:18:23.159 --> 00:18:24.302\nkind of demonstrate.\n\n368\n00:18:24.302 --> 00:18:26.215\nI'd mentioned the protocols.\n\n369\n00:18:26.215 --> 00:18:30.286\nI mentioned Thunderbolt versus USB,\nfor example, and\n\n370\n00:18:30.286 --> 00:18:33.410\nhow Thunderbolt is a transport protocol.\n\n371\n00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.620\nAnd USB 3.0 and USB 3.1,\nthose are transport protocols.\n\n372\n00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:43.390\nThere are other ones like SATA, the serial\nATA, which, what is ATA, it's advanced.\n\n373\n00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.666\nWhat is it?\n&gt;&gt; Advanced transfer attachment, or.\n\n374\n00:18:47.666 --> 00:18:50.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a very,\nvery old technology.\n\n375\n00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.970\nThe joke is, SATA stands for serial ATA.\n\n376\n00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.804\nIt's the old ATA protocol that's\nbeing done over serial cable.\n\n377\n00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:01.242\nSo, it's much, much faster, Ronnie's\n[LAUGH] gonna look it up real quick.\n\n378\n00:19:01.242 --> 00:19:08.190\nBut when I pull up a botless Mac menu and\nI went into my system report, right?\n\n379\n00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.510\nAnd I pulled up my internal drive.\n\n380\n00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:14.310\nMy internal drive showed\nup here under SATA.\n\n381\n00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:18.540\nI've got this SATA/SATA Express and\nthere's my internal drive.\n\n382\n00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.540\nIt's connected to the motherboard\nvia a cable, right?\n\n383\n00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.770\nExcept it's all kind of soldered in there.\n\n384\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:24.580\nSo I don't see that, but\n\n385\n00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.300\nthat's the protocol that it's using\nto communicate over that link.\n\n386\n00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.590\nThere are other technologies,\nlike really old Macs used all SCSI.\n\n387\n00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.415\nYou can say, it's SCSI or\nS-C-S-I connections.\n\n388\n00:19:35.415 --> 00:19:37.950\nAnd I don't even see that in my list here.\n\n389\n00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.800\nWell, I guess I have\nParallel SCSI up here, but\n\n390\n00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.640\nI don't have any Parallel SCSI devices.\n\n391\n00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.496\nAnd the odds are you don't either, right?\n\n392\n00:19:43.496 --> 00:19:45.615\nThey kinda moved away\nfrom that a while ago.\n\n393\n00:19:45.615 --> 00:19:48.950\nBut you might have FireWire disks,\nFibre Channel is another one.\n\n394\n00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.800\nWe use Fibre Channel connections\non our editing stations here for\n\n395\n00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.890\nediting videos, the older ATA is up here.\n\n396\n00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:56.152\nSo you may have connections there.\n\n397\n00:19:56.152 --> 00:19:58.415\nBut when I plug in a USB or\na thunderbolt drive,\n\n398\n00:19:58.415 --> 00:20:01.442\nit'll actually show up here\nunder thunderbolt or under USB.\n\n399\n00:20:01.442 --> 00:20:03.738\nAnd when I look, like here,\nlooking under USB,\n\n400\n00:20:03.738 --> 00:20:07.280\nI see some devices, even though I\ndon't have anything plugged in.\n\n401\n00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.630\nA lot of these internal devices, like\nthe Bluetooth adapter and the touchpad.\n\n402\n00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.070\nThey show up as USB devices,\n\n403\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:16.435\neven though I don't have them\nplugged in from an external source.\n\n404\n00:20:16.435 --> 00:20:17.897\nAnd that's just because on the inside,\n\n405\n00:20:17.897 --> 00:20:20.260\nthey're using that\ncommunications protocol.\n\n406\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:24.390\nSo each of these devices show up different\nways and you'll detect it in here and\n\n407\n00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.590\nbe able to see that information.\n\n408\n00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.800\nAll right, [COUGH] now I just\nplugged in my hard drive.\n\n409\n00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.040\nSo it'll show up here in a minute.\n\n410\n00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.430\nIt takes a second for\nthis screen to refresh itself.\n\n411\n00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:36.240\nI could close out and\ncome back in but either way.\n\n412\n00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.180\nSo be aware that our different protocols,\nsome of them are proprietary,\n\n413\n00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.690\nsome of them are open standard.\n\n414\n00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.097\nUSB's an open standard,\nanybody can support that.\n\n415\n00:20:44.097 --> 00:20:46.296\nSo you'll see different\nones that are out there.\n\n416\n00:20:46.296 --> 00:20:51.370\nBut none of this storage is ready to\nbe used until we prepare it, right?\n\n417\n00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.780\nNow, when you go and\nbuy removable storage, let's say,\n\n418\n00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.660\nyou just run to the store and buy a USB\nhard drive, or a thumb drive, real quick.\n\n419\n00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.567\nThe odds are, on it's been formatted\nto work with Windows, right?\n\n420\n00:21:00.567 --> 00:21:04.475\nIn the Windows world, there's a file\nsystem they use called FAT 32.\n\n421\n00:21:04.475 --> 00:21:06.606\nAnd there's another file\nsystem used to call NTFS.\n\n422\n00:21:06.606 --> 00:21:10.692\nAnd those are great file systems for them,\nbut they don't work so well on a Mac.\n\n423\n00:21:10.692 --> 00:21:12.671\nWell, I shouldn't say FAT\n32 is a great file system.\n\n424\n00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:14.660\nFAT 32 has some really big limits.\n\n425\n00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.320\nIt works on Mac and\nWindows, which is nice, but\n\n426\n00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:22.090\nit can't handle files over four gigs\nin size and it's really fragile.\n\n427\n00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.860\nIf you pop a disk out\nwithout properly ejecting,\n\n428\n00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.460\nit you can damage files really easy.\n\n429\n00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.980\nSo, it's not a good file system.\n\n430\n00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.357\nNTFS is much better, but\nit only works on Windows.\n\n431\n00:21:30.357 --> 00:21:31.800\nIt doesn't work on a Mac.\n\n432\n00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.400\nSo fif we go and\n\n433\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.220\nbuy new storage, we normally have to get\nit ready to be used inside of the Mac.\n\n434\n00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.917\nAnd the first part of getting it ready is\nto do what's called partitioning the disk.\n\n435\n00:21:41.917 --> 00:21:45.152\nNow in the olden days,\nwe partitioned quite a bit.\n\n436\n00:21:45.152 --> 00:21:49.407\nWe would take a physical disk and divide\nit up in pieces so that we could have some\n\n437\n00:21:49.407 --> 00:21:53.086\ndata stored here, some data stored there,\nkind of isolate it out.\n\n438\n00:21:53.086 --> 00:21:56.737\nBut these days drives have gotten so\nbig and storage has gotten so\n\n439\n00:21:56.737 --> 00:21:59.247\ncheap that most of us\ndon't worry about it.\n\n440\n00:21:59.247 --> 00:22:02.200\nYou just do what's called\none big partition.\n\n441\n00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.462\nSo for example, I just plugged this\nterabyte drive into my system.\n\n442\n00:22:05.462 --> 00:22:09.752\nAnd I'm gonna go into the disk utility,\nso let me just bring up my spotlight and\n\n443\n00:22:09.752 --> 00:22:11.512\nI'll fire up the disk utility.\n\n444\n00:22:11.512 --> 00:22:16.397\nAnd in the disk utility, I can see my\nMacintosh HD where my operating system is.\n\n445\n00:22:16.397 --> 00:22:20.312\nAnd I can see the Western Digital Elements\ndrive that I just plugged in.\n\n446\n00:22:20.312 --> 00:22:25.330\nHere I can see the partition table, and\nit's one terrabyte and it's Untitled.\n\n447\n00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.470\nI have one partition across that disk.\n\n448\n00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.050\nBut I could divide it up if I want.\n\n449\n00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.260\nWhen you look up top here, you'll\nsee where I can erase this disk, and\n\n450\n00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.490\nthere's a partition button.\n\n451\n00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:37.499\nAnd the partition button's\nactually kinda grayed out here,\n\n452\n00:22:37.499 --> 00:22:38.900\ncuz I'm on the disk itself.\n\n453\n00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.882\nIf I navigate through,\nor actually hang on.\n\n454\n00:22:41.882 --> 00:22:43.943\nIt might not let me partition this one.\n\n455\n00:22:43.943 --> 00:22:47.523\nLet's see, if we erase that one,\nand flip it.\n\n456\n00:22:47.523 --> 00:22:48.870\nNope, it's not gonna let me.\n\n457\n00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.070\nThere are some USB devices that\nwon't let you partition if they\n\n458\n00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.620\nhave some preexisting data on them.\n\n459\n00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.602\nLike if you're using them on the Windows\nsites, we have to kinda clean the disk and\n\n460\n00:22:56.602 --> 00:22:57.741\nthat can cause some problems.\n\n461\n00:22:57.741 --> 00:23:00.649\nThere's other disks, though,\nlike if I highlight my Apple SSD.\n\n462\n00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:03.180\nSee how that partition button lights up?\n\n463\n00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.418\nAnd I can hit that button and\n\n464\n00:23:05.418 --> 00:23:09.998\nwhat I'll see is where I've\ngot one big disk right now.\n\n465\n00:23:09.998 --> 00:23:14.350\nBut I could start hitting this\nplus sign and dividing it up.\n\n466\n00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.080\nAnd there's a few examples\nwhere we might do that,\n\n467\n00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.670\nlike if you were gonna do boot camp.\n\n468\n00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:21.680\nWhere you had Windows and\nMac OS running on your Mac side by side.\n\n469\n00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.590\nYou'd wanna partition them separately so\n\n470\n00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.040\nthat your Mac hard drive could be\nformatted for the Mac system and\n\n471\n00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.430\nyour Windows hard drive could be\nformatted for the Windows system.\n\n472\n00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.860\nBut you could go even further.\n\n473\n00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.813\nI could create multiple partitions\nbased on what I needed.\n\n474\n00:23:33.813 --> 00:23:38.636\nAnd so I might have Macintosh HD for\nmy operating system and\n\n475\n00:23:38.636 --> 00:23:41.696\nthen I might have my work files here.\n\n476\n00:23:41.696 --> 00:23:46.210\nAnd I might have my personal files here.\n\n477\n00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:51.323\nAnd I don't know,\ntemporary storage there, right?\n\n478\n00:23:51.323 --> 00:23:55.318\nSo now I've got these three different\nvolumes, or four altogether, right?\n\n479\n00:23:55.318 --> 00:23:58.661\nAnd each one of these I would\nstore different data on, right,\n\n480\n00:23:58.661 --> 00:24:02.455\ndifferent information based on what\nI want and then I can always resize\n\n481\n00:24:02.455 --> 00:24:06.140\nthese by clicking and dragging or\nby using the size boxes over here.\n\n482\n00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.460\nSo, the temporary storage,\nmaybe I don't want that to be 20 gigs, but\n\n483\n00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:14.280\npersonal files, I want that to be,\nI don't know let's\n\n484\n00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:20.230\nsay a 125 and now,\nlet's see if we can't get this all even.\n\n485\n00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.780\nAnd I'll take, just wanna make it under,\nit gets kinda hard to make them even.\n\n486\n00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.130\nYou see how it's kind of\nresizing one to resize the other?\n\n487\n00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.280\nIt gets a little tricky.\n\n488\n00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.200\nBut if you fidget around with it enough,\nyou'll get it to where you want it to be,\n\n489\n00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.370\nand kind of have everything laid out.\n\n490\n00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.150\nSo basically,\nyou can start to divide your drive up,\n\n491\n00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:39.190\nand understand that you're not creating\nseparate physical hard drives.\n\n492\n00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.810\nIf the drive fails I'll loss all of this,\nright?\n\n493\n00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.860\nThese are creating virtual hard drives,\nlittle separations,\n\n494\n00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.660\nlittle walls on the disk\nthat I'm creating.\n\n495\n00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:52.980\nAnd this partition, Is being stored in\nwhat's called a partition table, right?\n\n496\n00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.240\nThe partition table lists each of these\ndifferent drives that I'm creating.\n\n497\n00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.730\nIf I take,\nI'm not gonna mess with this one,\n\n498\n00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.490\ncuz that's where my operating system is.\n\n499\n00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.905\nBut if I take that Western Digital\nelements drive and I hit erase,\n\n500\n00:25:02.905 --> 00:25:03.845\nwhen I hit Erase.\n\n501\n00:25:03.845 --> 00:25:06.230\nWhen I go to erase it, it's,\nit's asking me a couple of questions.\n\n502\n00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.420\nAnd I'm gonna talk about\nthe format a little bit later.\n\n503\n00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.630\nBut right here I've got Scheme.\n\n504\n00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.660\nAnd under Scheme, it's asking me what\ntype of partition table I wanna maintain.\n\n505\n00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.640\nAnd there's three table types\nsupported by MAC OS Sierra.\n\n506\n00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.450\nThere's actually a fourth one\nthat under undocumented but\n\n507\n00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.600\nthere's the three that\nwe really care about.\n\n508\n00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.860\nSo, we've got the Master Boot Record\nwhich is the default.\n\n509\n00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.210\nThe Master Boot Record or MBR,\nthat's the one that's supported and\n\n510\n00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.980\nreally came from the Microsoft world,\nright?\n\n511\n00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.430\nMicrosoft DOS used the MBR format,\nthat's where it originated.\n\n512\n00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.760\nAnd that means that\nwhen your system boots,\n\n513\n00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.620\nWindows can recognize the boot\nrecord as well as Mac OS.\n\n514\n00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.040\nIt's very compatible, right?\n\n515\n00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.400\nMBRs of all technology\nhad some limitations.\n\n516\n00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.490\nFor example you can only have four\npartitions if you were formatted with MBR.\n\n517\n00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:53.158\nIf you wanted more than four you had to do\nthese logical partitions they got kinda\n\n518\n00:25:53.158 --> 00:25:55.636\nmessy they were like tricks and\nhacks to make it work.\n\n519\n00:25:55.636 --> 00:26:02.700\nSo over time, that was replaced by\nthe GPT, or GUID Partition Map, right?\n\n520\n00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.690\nA GUID is a globally unique identifier.\n\n521\n00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:09.787\nAnd each partition created a GUID\npartition map has this unique number\n\n522\n00:26:09.787 --> 00:26:10.489\nassigned.\n\n523\n00:26:10.489 --> 00:26:14.009\nIt's this big long letter and\nnumber combination that is, in theory,\n\n524\n00:26:14.009 --> 00:26:16.030\nunique across the entire planet.\n\n525\n00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:19.210\nIt's such a massive number that you\nshould be the only one that has it.\n\n526\n00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.090\nAnd that way you can identify that disk.\n\n527\n00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:25.990\nGPT is supported by newer versions of\nWindows and newer versions of Mac OS and\n\n528\n00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:30.050\nthis is usually what you're going\nto want on your modern disks.\n\n529\n00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.560\nUnless you're having to\nintegrate with older systems,\n\n530\n00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.440\nthey won't be able to read this, right?\n\n531\n00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.420\nSo we been joking around,\n\n532\n00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:41.170\nin some of our intros Ronnie's\nmentioned Mac OS 10.2 instead of 10.12.\n\n533\n00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.290\nWell, Mac OS 10.2 didn't recognize GPT.\n\n534\n00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:47.170\nAnd so if you plugged a dot drive\ninto that it wouldn't work, right?\n\n535\n00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.000\nBut if you have all monitor systems,\nit's not a problem.\n\n536\n00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.660\nGPT is the future,\nthat's usually what we're going to want.\n\n537\n00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.040\nBut if you know you're going to moving\nan external drive between systems, and\n\n538\n00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.560\nthere's gonna be a lot of variation there,\nthen that can cause some problems.\n\n539\n00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.820\nAnd then you might want to go ahead and\ndefault back to the older MBR, all right.\n\n540\n00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.600\nNow there's a third one, Apple Partition\nMap, and you might be tempted and\n\n541\n00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.020\nsay, hey, I'm on a Mac.\n\n542\n00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.370\nI like Apple,\nI'm gonna go Apple Partition Map.\n\n543\n00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.615\nDon't pick this one, right?\n\n544\n00:27:11.615 --> 00:27:14.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is ancient history.\n\n545\n00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:17.130\nApple, a long time ago,\nbefore they did the Intel switch,\n\n546\n00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.760\nwas using the Apple Partition Map for\ntheir systems back in the SCSI drive days.\n\n547\n00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.750\nIf you've got really old systems, you\nmight need to be able to connect to mount\n\n548\n00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.400\nthose, and\nthat's why that support is here.\n\n549\n00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.090\nIt's really there for\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n550\n00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.480\nIt's not intended to be used anymore.\n\n551\n00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.200\nIt is the older of the technology.\n\n552\n00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.080\nAl right now,\nwhen I pick one of these partition maps,\n\n553\n00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.920\nright so If I pick GUID partition map,\nand I'll call this my,\n\n554\n00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.860\nDon's USB Storage or\nwhatever it is I want to call it.\n\n555\n00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.810\nIt's gonna automatically format that disk,\n\n556\n00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:50.890\nit's gonna get it ready, and it's going\nto fail on me, so what did it do?\n\n557\n00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:51.390\nLet's see.\n\n558\n00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.910\nSo every now and then you might\nget something like this, right?\n\n559\n00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.070\nSee how it says unmounting the disk\ncouldn't open the device, right.\n\n560\n00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:00.980\nWell, that means that something on my\nsystem was accessing the disk at the time.\n\n561\n00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.560\nAnd so it wasn't able to release it and\nit failed.\n\n562\n00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.210\nWell, if it had just been patient,\nthen it probably would've succeeded.\n\n563\n00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:10.210\nAnd in my case, it just wasn't patient.\n\n564\n00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:11.060\nSo I'm gonna hit Done.\n\n565\n00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.950\nAnd I'm gonna try it again.\n\n566\n00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:16.610\nAnd a lot of times, what you'll find is\nthat the second time you do it, it works.\n\n567\n00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.710\nAll right, and so we'll run it again.\n\n568\n00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.840\nAnd this time, there we go,\nand it works, right?\n\n569\n00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.770\nIf you just wait a moment, and\n\n570\n00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:27.510\nmake sure that whatever process is hitting\nthat disc releases, then it'll run.\n\n571\n00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:30.501\nIf it doesn't, right, if you run it\na second time and it still fails,\n\n572\n00:28:30.501 --> 00:28:33.293\nthen usually if you just reboot\nyour system that'll free it up and\n\n573\n00:28:33.293 --> 00:28:37.450\nstop whatever it was accessing that disk,\nand it'll let you get in there and do it.\n\n574\n00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:41.020\nBut now that's done, it's erased,\nhere's the drive I can see it.\n\n575\n00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:45.240\nIf I look down here the Partition Map is\nshowing is the GUID Partition Map, so\n\n576\n00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.700\nthat's good and it's up and it's going.\n\n577\n00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.250\nAnd I'm now got this disk ready to use,\nright.\n\n578\n00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:53.310\nThe partition is on it, but\nthe partition isn't enough.\n\n579\n00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.300\nWe actually have to take that\npartition and format it, and\n\n580\n00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.340\nput a file system on it.\n\n581\n00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.800\nI'm gonna talk about file\nsystems in the next episode,\n\n582\n00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.460\ncuz I'm kinda running out of time here.\n\n583\n00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:07.630\nBut basically, this disk is up and ready,\nand we can start to make use of it.\n\n584\n00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.990\nNow, I still can't partition it, right?\n\n585\n00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.090\nWell, no, now I can.\n\n586\n00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.460\nNow that I've formatted it and\n\n587\n00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.450\nI've reset it over to GPT, there was\nlikely some older data on there cuz I had\n\n588\n00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.930\nplugged it into a Windows machine that\nwas stopping me from partitioning it.\n\n589\n00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.480\nSo by erasing it, now I can come in and\nI can partition this disk.\n\n590\n00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.870\nAnd I can start to divide that up, right?\n\n591\n00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:30.710\nSo if you ever see where that partition\nis blocked, the normal indicator, and\n\n592\n00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.430\nyou guys might not care about the\ntechnical details, is that if you format\n\n593\n00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:37.350\na disk on Windows, a lot of times it\nwill create an EFI partition on there.\n\n594\n00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:41.430\nAnd the disk utility hides\nthe EFI partitions by default.\n\n595\n00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:44.260\nAnd that's what stops me from\nbeing able to partition it.\n\n596\n00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.690\nBut when I erase the entire disk,\nit got rid of that hidden partition.\n\n597\n00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:48.770\nAnd now we can divide it up.\n\n598\n00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:53.190\nSo if you ever run into that in real life,\nyou can't see it through the GUI utility.\n\n599\n00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.350\nIf you go to the command\nline drop the terminal,\n\n600\n00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.220\nyou can use the disk util command line and\n\n601\n00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.010\nyou actually see the DFI partition\nin there and you can wipe it out.\n\n602\n00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.280\nSo just a little aside not on the exam but\n\n603\n00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.450\nsomething you might run\ninto it in real life.\n\n604\n00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.920\nAll right so now it can come through\nthough and I can't take this.\n\n605\n00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.960\nAnd I can say like maybe I'm gonna use\nhalf this disk for Time Machine right?\n\n606\n00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.170\nSo this is gonna be 500 gigs\nthat I assign for Time Machine.\n\n607\n00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.990\nAnd then the other half,\nI want to come in and\n\n608\n00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:23.410\nuse for, I don't know,\ntemporary storage, right?\n\n609\n00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:26.720\nSo this is stuff that I might be sharing\nwith somebody else, or whatever.\n\n610\n00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.460\nSo I divide it in half, 500 and\n500, or maybe 750 and 250,\n\n611\n00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.790\nor however I want to divide it.\n\n612\n00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.122\nI can apply that and it's gonna partition\nthat out and now I'll have that storage\n\n613\n00:30:37.122 --> 00:30:40.356\navailable, unless I get an error which\ncase, I'll just do it a second time and\n\n614\n00:30:40.356 --> 00:30:42.628\nthen [LAUGH] it'll partition\nout a whole new business.\n\n615\n00:30:42.628 --> 00:30:46.059\nBut no, it's running through\njust fine right there.\n\n616\n00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:48.390\nAl right, so that is probably\na pretty good spot to stop.\n\n617\n00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:52.100\nI do need to talk more about file systems,\nbut we'll need to do that in part two.\n\n618\n00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:57.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well that's a great\nreminder for us to think about the idea,\n\n619\n00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.270\nhere, of making sure that we understand\nthe storage that's available for\n\n620\n00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:03.250\nus, when running,\nof course, Mac OS Sierra.\n\n621\n00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.950\nMaking sure that we understand\ndifference between internal as well as\n\n622\n00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:07.050\nexternal storage.\n\n623\n00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:11.860\nAnd preparing that disk and disks so\nthat we can get ready to use downtime to\n\n624\n00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.320\nbe able to put operating systems as\nwell as our files on them as well.\n\n625\n00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.250\nThank you again, Don for\nhelping us out there.\n\n626\n00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.170\nAnd thank you also for watching.\n\n627\n00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:22.790\nSigning off from ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n628\n00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:23.750\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n629\n00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:27.711\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n630\n00:31:27.711 -->

[CROSSTALK]\nYou're\n\n4\n00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:12.174\nwatching IT PRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:15.030\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here IT PRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.580\nYou're watching the apple certified\nsupport professional for Mac OS Sierra.\n\n7\n00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.456\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, today were\ntaking a look at a part II on file storage\n\n8\n00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:27.038\nand here to help us to continue to\nunderstand some more depth about this is\n\n9\n00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:29.940\ngonna be Mr. Don Pezet,\nDon welcome back to the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.320\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back Ronnie, and\n\n11\n00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.970\nyeah just kinda continuing\non with storage.\n\n12\n00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.974\nIn the last episode we talked about\nsome of the different types of storage\n\n13\n00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:37.300\nthat we find in Macs.\n\n14\n00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.867\nAnd then I took a drive, we partitioned\nit, and I just really quickly formatted it\n\n15\n00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:44.590\nat the end of the show as we didn't have\nenough time to talk about file systems.\n\n16\n00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.706\nAnd so, in this episode,\nthat's where I want to start.\n\n17\n00:00:46.706 --> 00:00:49.260\nI wanna start by talking\nabout file systems.\n\n18\n00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.130\nWhen you partition a disk,\nyou're putting \"walls\" in the disk.\n\n19\n00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.765\nVirtual walls, not real ones,\nthey can isolate and separate your data.\n\n20\n00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:58.980\nWell, the nice part about\nthese walls is that,\n\n21\n00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.750\ninside of them,\nyou can then apply a file system.\n\n22\n00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.040\nAnd when you apply a file system,\nnow you can actually put files on it.\n\n23\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.870\nWell, at that point,\nit's not just a partition anymore.\n\n24\n00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.530\nIt now becomes a volume,\nthat terminology's important, right?\n\n25\n00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.660\nWhen I divide up the disk and\nI'm partitioning it.\n\n26\n00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.560\nAnd then, when I put a file\nsystem on that I create a volume.\n\n27\n00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.920\nSo if I create three partitions, and\nthen I format the three partitions,\n\n28\n00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.430\nI now have three volumes.\n\n29\n00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.790\nI can use a volume, I can't really use\na partition until it becomes a volume.\n\n30\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.457\nNow when we format it, when we apply\nthe file system to that storage,\n\n31\n00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:33.700\nthere's actually a couple of\nchoices that we have, right?\n\n32\n00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.290\nSo for example,\nlet me go back into my disk utility here.\n\n33\n00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.530\nThis is what I did at\nthe very end of the show.\n\n34\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.170\nI took my USB storage and\nI divided it up into two drives, right.\n\n35\n00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.630\nWell, I'm gonna divide it again.\n\n36\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.350\nThis time I'm gonna go to four drives.\n\n37\n00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.800\nAnd I'm gonna divide that\nup into four pieces, and\n\n38\n00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.460\neach one I'm gonna format\na slightly different way.\n\n39\n00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.250\nSo I'm gonna take my first one here,\nthe one I labeled as time machine.\n\n40\n00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.150\nAnd if you look at the options here\non my screen I've got the name,\n\n41\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.300\nwhich you can call it whatever you want.\n\n42\n00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.712\nAnd then the format, and the format is\ndefaulting to Mac OS Extended Journaled\n\n43\n00:02:07.712 --> 00:02:12.000\nand I'm gonna type that as the name,\njust so I can remember what it is, right.\n\n44\n00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.520\nAnd that's kind of a long name,\nbut we'll run with it.\n\n45\n00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.350\nSo extended journal.\n\n46\n00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.820\nAnd that is the file system\nit's going to apply,\n\n47\n00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.850\nthat it's going to turn it into a volume.\n\n48\n00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.570\nBut I've got more choices.\n\n49\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.979\nI've got Mac OS Extended Journal\nencrypted,\n\n50\n00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.450\nMac OC Extended Case Sensitive Journal and\nCase Sensitive Journal encrypted.\n\n51\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.427\nI've also had an exFAT and\nMS-DOS FAT, right.\n\n52\n00:02:33.427 --> 00:02:36.660\nSo what exactly is going on here?\n\n53\n00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.860\nWhich one should I pick?\n\n54\n00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.970\nWhich one serves what purpose?\n\n55\n00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.285\nWell, if you're dealing in an all Apple\nworld and you're happy with your ecosystem\n\n56\n00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:46.400\nthen, you're normally just\ngonna stick with the default.\n\n57\n00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.530\nMac OS Extended Journaled.\n\n58\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.520\nThe Mac OS Extended file system is one\ncreated by Apple, so it's proprietary.\n\n59\n00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.020\nIt's only supported by Apple.\n\n60\n00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.080\nIt doesn't work on Linux,\nit doesn't work on Windows,\n\n61\n00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.940\nit just works in the Apple world.\n\n62\n00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.330\nBut let me tell you, it does a great job.\n\n63\n00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.890\nYou're gonna get the best performance and\nthe best stability by choosing this one.\n\n64\n00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.130\nMac OS Extended Journaled, that journaled\npart is a key part of the stability there.\n\n65\n00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.380\nNot every file system is journaled,\nthis is special.\n\n66\n00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.850\nThere actually is a Mac OS Extended\nthat isn't journaled, but\n\n67\n00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.230\nI don't have that option.\n\n68\n00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.520\nIn older versions of Mac OS, you actually\nhad the option to do it non-journaled.\n\n69\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.841\nWhat journaling does,\nit says any time you write to the disk,\n\n70\n00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:27.090\ni f it's a new file, you just write\nit to the disk, that's it, right.\n\n71\n00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.890\nBut if a file already exists, let's say,\nI'm making a change to a file, right.\n\n72\n00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.260\nImagine this,\nimagine that I've got a picture, and\n\n73\n00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.960\nthe picture is 10 megs in size.\n\n74\n00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.360\nAnd I go and change a few little dots\non that picture, then I go to save it.\n\n75\n00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.280\nWell I only changed a little of it,\nbut I start writing to the disk,\n\n76\n00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.070\nwriting the 10 megs,\nthen all of a sudden I lose power.\n\n77\n00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.610\nWell, what happened,\nI was halfway through a write.\n\n78\n00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.720\nAnd so when the system boots back up,\n\n79\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.630\nthat image is now corrupted,\nit has half the data written to it.\n\n80\n00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.900\nHalf of it is new data,\nhalf of it is old data.\n\n81\n00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.360\nIt's damaged, and\nI can't recover that image, right.\n\n82\n00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.312\nSo losing data like\nthat is really painful,\n\n83\n00:04:01.312 --> 00:04:04.847\nespecially removable media where you\ncould disconnect the drive by accident,\n\n84\n00:04:04.847 --> 00:04:08.400\nit happens very frequently, far more\nfrequently than power outages, right.\n\n85\n00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.116\nBut with journalling, it says, all right\nif you're about to write a file and\n\n86\n00:04:12.116 --> 00:04:13.374\nthe file already exists,\n\n87\n00:04:13.374 --> 00:04:17.220\ninstead of overwriting the file we're\ngonna write to an all new spot.\n\n88\n00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.947\nWe're gonna write it separate and\n\n89\n00:04:18.947 --> 00:04:22.350\nwe're gonna write it to the disk\nuntil it gets to 100% written.\n\n90\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.190\nWhen it's 100% done, then we just remove\nthe old file and you've got the new one.\n\n91\n00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.241\nAnd now, if you were halfway through\nthe write and you lost power,\n\n92\n00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:34.056\nthe system would boot back up and it would\nsay, you were halfway through the write,\n\n93\n00:04:34.056 --> 00:04:37.680\nso I'm just going to throw the write away,\nand I still have the original file.\n\n94\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.090\nAnd it puts it back, and we're able to\nrecover, and things work much better.\n\n95\n00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.020\nSo that journaled option right\nthere gives us a lot of stability.\n\n96\n00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.330\nAnd so Apple doesn't even give us\nthe option to do non-journal any more.\n\n97\n00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.960\nYou'll notice all four versions of\nMac OS Extended support journaling now.\n\n98\n00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.646\nSo the only real choice that I have here\nis whether I want it to be encrypted,\n\n99\n00:04:55.646 --> 00:04:58.500\ncase sensitive, or both.\n\n100\n00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.080\nCase sensitive and encrypted, right,\nthat's that fourth option right there.\n\n101\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.260\nSo when would I pick these?\n\n102\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.220\nWell, encrypted,\nI could encrypt the disk itself.\n\n103\n00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.210\nAll right, well, that's cool, but be aware\nthat this is different than file vault.\n\n104\n00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.640\nI talk about file vault\nin another episode.\n\n105\n00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.230\nWith file vault, when I boot up my\nsystem the key is stored as part\n\n106\n00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.890\nof the TPM on the motherboard,\nthat trusted platform module.\n\n107\n00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.180\nAnd it's able to boot up and\n\n108\n00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.410\nload right in as long as I login\nwith my user account and password.\n\n109\n00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.510\nIt decrypts the disc and I'm able to\naccess it and everything works fine.\n\n110\n00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.840\nWhen I choose this type of encryption,\nthough, this is really talking about for\n\n111\n00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.810\nremovable disks.\n\n112\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.190\nWhen I plug a removable disk into my\nsystem, it's gonna prompt me for a key, or\n\n113\n00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.460\na password to put in and decrypt it.\n\n114\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.790\nThis is actually an older type\nof encryption in file vault.\n\n115\n00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.520\nSo, if you want to encrypt your disk,\nfile vault is the better option right?\n\n116\n00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.700\nSo you wanna do it through\nfile vault instead.\n\n117\n00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.540\nBut for removal media that doesn't\nalways work so well, and so\n\n118\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.170\nthe older style encryption is\nstill supported right here.\n\n119\n00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.990\nAnd then, case sensitive.\n\n120\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.480\nUnder the hood Mac OS is\nactually running BSD Unix, and\n\n121\n00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.900\nUnix expects your file\nsystem to be case sensitive.\n\n122\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.874\nThat means that you might have multiple\nfiles with the exact same name,\n\n123\n00:06:10.874 --> 00:06:14.060\nexcept some have capital letters and\nsome have lower case letters, right.\n\n124\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.334\nIt's easier for me to show it than explain\nit, so I'll format it just that way and\n\n125\n00:06:17.334 --> 00:06:19.570\nactually show you guys how that works.\n\n126\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.090\nBut the normal file system\nisn't like that and\n\n127\n00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.260\nso, it doesn't support case sensitivity,\nwe can choose to enforce that if we want.\n\n128\n00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.830\nSo those are kind of the different choices\nthere for MAC OS, and in an Apple world,\n\n129\n00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.200\nthat's what we normally want.\n\n130\n00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.300\nBut on removable media, that's were\nthings get a little bit different.\n\n131\n00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.010\nIf I take a Mac OS Extended Journaled\nhard drive and\n\n132\n00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.700\nI plug it in to a Windows machine,\nit can't read it.\n\n133\n00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.250\nOr if I plug it into a Linux machine,\nit can't read it.\n\n134\n00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.890\nSo, instead I need to go for compatibility\nand that's what these last two are.\n\n135\n00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.310\nexFAT and MS-DOS FAT.\n\n136\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.716\nIf you choose MS-DOS FAT.\n\n137\n00:06:52.716 --> 00:06:58.670\nThat DOS FAT that's the old Microsoft Disk\nOperating System File Allocation Table,\n\n138\n00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.580\nthat works on everything.\n\n139\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.870\nMac OS, Linux, Windows,\nthey all support it, they can read to it,\n\n140\n00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:06.880\nthey can write to it.\n\n141\n00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.473\nIt's all compatible, you get the best\nlevel of compatibility with it, but\n\n142\n00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:14.220\nit's ancient, it's really, really old.\n\n143\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.720\nAnd so,\nit can't handle files over 4 gigs in size.\n\n144\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.678\nIt can't handle partitions\nover 2 terabytes in size.\n\n145\n00:07:20.678 --> 00:07:23.880\nIt can't handle long file\nnames in a lot of cases,\n\n146\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.400\nit freaks out on stuff like that.\n\n147\n00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.200\nIt really is not a very robust file\nsystem, it's yesterdays file system.\n\n148\n00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.730\nIt's also very fragile, power outages,\n\n149\n00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.640\nunsafe disconnects that can break your\nfile data and you can lose information.\n\n150\n00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.870\nIt's not the file system you wanna\nuse unless, you absolutely have to.\n\n151\n00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.950\nexFAT is the Extended File Allocation\nTable, it's the newer version of FAT.\n\n152\n00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.801\nAnd Microsoft has started using this for\nsome removable drives.\n\n153\n00:07:50.801 --> 00:07:56.247\nIt does support Files over 4 gigs in size\nand it does support being read from and\n\n154\n00:07:56.247 --> 00:08:01.131\nwritten to on multiple operating systems,\nBut it's still fragile.\n\n155\n00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:05.645\nIt's still just as fragile as FAT32 or\nMS OS fat it's just as fragile as\n\n156\n00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:09.050\nthose guys were too so\nit doesn't solve that problem.\n\n157\n00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.960\nWe typically want to use Mac OS\nextended journal anytime we can and\n\n158\n00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.470\nwe only want to use these other\ntwo if we absolutely have to.\n\n159\n00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.650\nAll right so, what I'm going to do is\nI'm going to format this first one,\n\n160\n00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.600\nMac OS extended journal.\n\n161\n00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.630\nI'm gonna take the second one and\n\n162\n00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.887\nI'm gonna do the case-sensitive version,\nright?\n\n163\n00:08:28.887 --> 00:08:34.119\nSo I'll just call these\nExtended Case Sensitive.\n\n164\n00:08:37.812 --> 00:08:39.905\nAnd I'll just call this\nother one Extended,\n\n165\n00:08:39.905 --> 00:08:42.949\njust trying to make it where it\nfits on the screen a little better.\n\n166\n00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:46.040\nMy other two, I'll go ahead and\nformat one of them ExFAT.\n\n167\n00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:52.460\nSo, I'll just call it ExFAT and\nthe last one is 250 gigs in size.\n\n168\n00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.130\nAnd I'm gonna format it MS-DOS(FAT).\n\n169\n00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.650\nNow, the name on this one is gonna be\nkind of interesting because the older FAT\n\n170\n00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.030\nsystem only supported capital letters.\n\n171\n00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.168\nAnd it only supported,\nI think 14 characters, or 15 characters,\n\n172\n00:09:05.168 --> 00:09:06.177\nsomething like that.\n\n173\n00:09:06.177 --> 00:09:08.845\nSo there's limitations to\nwhat we can even name it.\n\n174\n00:09:08.845 --> 00:09:10.530\nSo if you give it some crazy long name,\n\n175\n00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.593\nyou might find that it\nrejects the name on you.\n\n176\n00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:15.631\nBut I'm now formatting these as\nthe four different file systems.\n\n177\n00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:19.140\nJust one physical disk, but\nI've created four volumes at this point.\n\n178\n00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.951\nAnd I can apply that and what I'm going\nto see is when it's done, here we go,\n\n179\n00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:27.123\nit's going to partition to lay those out,\nI'll have four new hard drives appear on\n\n180\n00:09:27.123 --> 00:09:30.999\nmy desktop, because I've changed the\nFinder to allow those drives to show up\n\n181\n00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:34.012\non my desktop, but\notherwise I'll see them in the Finder.\n\n182\n00:09:34.012 --> 00:09:36.090\nAnd each one is going to show up and\nI can start to work with them.\n\n183\n00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.860\nNow to an end user,\nthey might not even notice the difference,\n\n184\n00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.460\nit's just four disks,\nthey all look the same, right?\n\n185\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.550\nSo we have to know which one's\nappropriate for our use case scenario so\n\n186\n00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.880\nwe pick the right one.\n\n187\n00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.120\nAnd I'm formatting the disks here,\nthese four file systems that we saw.\n\n188\n00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.571\nEach of them is fully supported by Mac OS.\n\n189\n00:09:56.571 --> 00:10:00.309\nThere's actually some others that don't\nshow up in the list that aren't fully\n\n190\n00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:01.340\nsupported.\n\n191\n00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:06.590\nSo for example, NTFS NTFS is\nthe default file system for Windows.\n\n192\n00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:11.930\nIf you plug an NTFS disk into your laptop\nor desktop MacOS will actually read it.\n\n193\n00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.590\nIt'll see it, it'll open it up but\nyou can't write to it.\n\n194\n00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.410\nIt only supports reading from NTFS,\nnot writing to it.\n\n195\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.950\nThere's also support for UFS,\nthe old Unix file system.\n\n196\n00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.270\nWhen I say old,\nthey were using it in the 1980s.\n\n197\n00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.720\nThe unit file system's ancient, but\nwe are running BSD units under the hood.\n\n198\n00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.040\nSo if you were to plug a UFS disk in it\nwould actually be able to read that too.\n\n199\n00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.890\nSo, there are some other files systems but\n\n200\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.060\nthe four that we see here\nare the main ones that are supported.\n\n201\n00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:41.244\nNow that's done it's formatted out and if\nI look at my desktop here I've got these\n\n202\n00:10:41.244 --> 00:10:46.688\nfour discs I've got ExFat, Extended,\nExtended Case Sensitive and FAT.\n\n203\n00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:49.010\nThey're all just sitting\nright there on my desktop and\n\n204\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.920\nto an end user they all look the same but\n\n205\n00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.390\nthey each have their own little\nweaknesses and odd behaviors, right?\n\n206\n00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.372\nSo, for example,\nif I fire up a Terminal and\n\n207\n00:10:58.372 --> 00:11:02.677\nin my Terminal window,\nif I go into /Volumes,\n\n208\n00:11:02.677 --> 00:11:08.401\nI can pull it up here and\nI see those different volumes, right.\n\n209\n00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:11.770\nAnd if I go into the extended folder,\nright, so\n\n210\n00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:16.586\nthis is the Mac OS extended journal,\nand I'm going to touch a file.\n\n211\n00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:19.792\nI'll just call it file.txt, all right.\n\n212\n00:11:19.792 --> 00:11:21.730\nWhat that does is it creates a file.\n\n213\n00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.367\nAnd if I look at it,\nthere is the file, file.txt, right.\n\n214\n00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:30.930\nNow, if I do touch FILE.TXT, see how\nit's all capital letters, and I pull up\n\n215\n00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:36.440\nthe listing, it didn't actually create a\nnew file, because it's not case-sensitive.\n\n216\n00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.900\nIt viewed it as already existing,\n\n217\n00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.830\nthere's already file.txt, it's just\nlowercase, it treats it as the same file.\n\n218\n00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.500\nThat's the normal behavior for\n\n219\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.070\nMacOS Extended Journal, but\nthat is not what's called POSIX compliant.\n\n220\n00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.620\nThat's not truly compliant\nwith what Unix expects.\n\n221\n00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.790\nMost of us don't care, right?\n\n222\n00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.550\nWho cares what Unix expects.\n\n223\n00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.260\nBut if you're trying to maintain\ncompatibility with Unix systems,\n\n224\n00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.630\nyou can, by doing\nMacOS Extended Journal Case Sensitive.\n\n225\n00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.090\nThat's a mouthful, but you can do it.\n\n226\n00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.730\nSo, if I were to switch to that other one,\n\n227\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.790\nto the Extended\\ Case\\ Sensitive, right?\n\n228\n00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.041\nSo now I'm in that folder and\n\n229\n00:12:14.041 --> 00:12:19.599\nit's empty right now,\nI will touch File.txt.\n\n230\n00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:25.309\nAll right, so now I've got File.txt and\nI'm gonna do all capital, right.\n\n231\n00:12:25.309 --> 00:12:29.423\nOr I could even do like mixed\ncase where I do capital and\n\n232\n00:12:29.423 --> 00:12:32.905\nlower case like all the cool kids do,\nright.\n\n233\n00:12:32.905 --> 00:12:36.310\nAnd as I touch each of these and\nI pull up my listing.\n\n234\n00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.040\nSee how each one is separate?\n\n235\n00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.520\nThose are viewed as three completely\nseparate files because they have different\n\n236\n00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.060\ncasing in them, it's case sensitive.\n\n237\n00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.338\nMost of us don't care about that but to be\nPOSIX compliant, to be a true Unix system\n\n238\n00:12:49.338 --> 00:12:53.003\nyou are supposed to support that and\nso Apple has that functionality.\n\n239\n00:12:53.003 --> 00:12:57.490\nA lot of people don't know this but\nMacOS is one of the only operating\n\n240\n00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.410\nsystems on sale today that can\nofficially be called Unix.\n\n241\n00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.120\nIt meets all the Unix requirements.\n\n242\n00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.100\nSo if you wanna impress the guys at\nthe datacenter, you can say, yeah,\n\n243\n00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:07.960\nI run Unix on my system.\n\n244\n00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.360\nAnd you wouldn't be lying, because you\nactually do all right so, let's see,\n\n245\n00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.900\nthe other two file systems were FAT and\nexFAT, right?\n\n246\n00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.420\nAnd they're not really\ngonna look any different,\n\n247\n00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.200\nI don't have anything crazy\nhere to show off on these guys\n\n248\n00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.910\nexcept they're just missing features.\n\n249\n00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:25.160\nThere is stuff that's\nnot supported on these.\n\n250\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.670\nSo for example, if I go back to my just\nregular finder here, if I take a file,\n\n251\n00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.510\nright, so\nI go into my regular extended journal.\n\n252\n00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.420\nI'll take this file, .txt file, and\n\n253\n00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.610\nI'm just gonna do a real quick copy and\npaste some data in it.\n\n254\n00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.420\nNothing spectacular,\nnot feeling creative today.\n\n255\n00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.424\nThere we go.\n\n256\n00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:47.008\nAll right, so I've got this file.\n\n257\n00:13:47.008 --> 00:13:51.227\nAnd if I do a get information on it and\nI take a look at the file, I get my\n\n258\n00:13:51.227 --> 00:13:55.891\nlittle preview of the file and all that,\nand if i scroll down even further,\n\n259\n00:13:55.891 --> 00:14:00.200\nI can get down to where I can set\npermissions on the file, right?\n\n260\n00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.080\nI have permissions, I can share it out,\nI can do restrictions and so on.\n\n261\n00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:11.170\nWell, if I take that same file, and\ncopy it over to the FAT disk for example.\n\n262\n00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.760\nSo, I'm just gonna drag it and drop it.\n\n263\n00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.940\nSo, here it is on the fat disk.\n\n264\n00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.410\nAll right, it let me copy it.\n\n265\n00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.380\nI can open and\nwork with it just like normal.\n\n266\n00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.210\nBut if I pull up the get information\non it and start to take a look at it,\n\n267\n00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:27.940\nwhat I'm gonna find is that\nthe permissions side is completely gone.\n\n268\n00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.570\nIt just says, you can read and\nwrite, and that's it.\n\n269\n00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.440\nYou can't set permissions.\n\n270\n00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.920\nFAT and FAT32, exFAT,\nthey don't support file permissions.\n\n271\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.356\nThey don't support encryption.\n\n272\n00:14:37.356 --> 00:14:38.854\nThey don't support journaling.\n\n273\n00:14:38.854 --> 00:14:40.444\nThey don't support a lot of things.\n\n274\n00:14:40.444 --> 00:14:41.980\nThere's a lot of things that\nare going to be missing,\n\n275\n00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.320\nbecause I chose this file system.\n\n276\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.120\nSo while it is supported, and\nit does get you great compatibility,\n\n277\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.850\nit's definitely not what you\nwant to use on a regular basis.\n\n278\n00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.500\nAll right let's see, so that was the four\nmain ones that talk about UFS, NTFS,\n\n279\n00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.030\nexFAT.\n\n280\n00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.300\nIt think those are all the main ones that\nwe really need to cover as far as the ones\n\n281\n00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.920\nthat are supported.\n\n282\n00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:07.550\nI will tell you that if you're just\nworking with macOS Extended Journal\n\n283\n00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.190\nit really maintains itself.\n\n284\n00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.790\nIt's a healthy operating system.\n\n285\n00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.340\nIt's got disk write protection in it.\n\n286\n00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.080\nIt does a great job with everything.\n\n287\n00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.270\nYou really not gonna have\nto mess with it much.\n\n288\n00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.970\nBut if you start supporting\nother file systems,\n\n289\n00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.740\nif you start doing exFAT and FAT32,\n\n290\n00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:25.500\nif you're doing a lot of removable media,\nyou're gonna frequently run into errors.\n\n291\n00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.610\nAnd when you run into errors, you're\ngonna need to be able to resolve those.\n\n292\n00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.300\nAnd one of the easiest ways to resolve\nit is through the disk utility.\n\n293\n00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.290\nSo let me show you that really quick.\n\n294\n00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.200\nI've actually been in the disk utility\nthis whole time where I've been creating\n\n295\n00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.670\nmy partitions, right.\n\n296\n00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.910\nSo here's all the different partitions\nI've been making in the disk utility.\n\n297\n00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:47.050\nWell I might find where an individual\nvolume becomes damaged, or\n\n298\n00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.820\nthe disk itself becomes damaged,\nright, and how would I know which?\n\n299\n00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.694\nIf I just lose access to one volume then\nit's obviously the volume that's damaged.\n\n300\n00:15:54.694 --> 00:15:57.312\nBut if I lose access to\nall the volumes on a disk,\n\n301\n00:15:57.312 --> 00:16:01.129\nthen it's a reasonable assumption\nthat the disk itself is damaged.\n\n302\n00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:04.468\nNow, when a disk is damaged It\ncould be a physical problem, and\n\n303\n00:16:04.468 --> 00:16:06.488\nyou're not gonna be able to fix that.\n\n304\n00:16:06.488 --> 00:16:08.756\nThe solution is to restore\nyour data to new storage, and\n\n305\n00:16:08.756 --> 00:16:10.660\nthrow your old storage in the trash,\nright?\n\n306\n00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.260\nThat's the solution, but if the problem\nis just with the single volume?\n\n307\n00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.890\nThat's usually a software problem.\n\n308\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.695\nAnd software problems we can resolve.\n\n309\n00:16:17.695 --> 00:16:21.590\nIt'll be a dirty write, where only a part\nof my data got written to the disk.\n\n310\n00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:25.680\nOr data got corrupted somehow, a magnetic\ninterference, or something like that.\n\n311\n00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.230\nAnd we can usually recover\nfrom that pretty easily.\n\n312\n00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.110\nAll you have to do is go\ninto your Disk Utility, and\n\n313\n00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.600\nchoose the volume that's\ngiving you problems.\n\n314\n00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.760\nMaybe this ExFAT or whatever.\n\n315\n00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.430\nYou can choose that volume, and then you\ncan use the First Aid button up here.\n\n316\n00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:40.570\nThe First Aid button,\n\n317\n00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.928\nwhat it actually does is it replaces\nwhat used to be two steps back in,\n\n318\n00:16:43.928 --> 00:16:48.060\nnot El Capitan, but in Mavericks,\nit was still two steps, I think.\n\n319\n00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:53.050\nWhere you could fix your permissions and\nfix your storage.\n\n320\n00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.570\nNow, it just does both together.\n\n321\n00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.470\nSo, it's going to check the disk for\nerrors.\n\n322\n00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.760\nSo it's going to look to see\nif it's any corrupted data.\n\n323\n00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.730\nAnd once it sorts that out,\nthen it's going to look for permissions.\n\n324\n00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:02.850\nSo it might be bad permissions.\n\n325\n00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.925\nWell, this an ExFAT disk, so\nthere's no permissions to check.\n\n326\n00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:08.490\nI's just going to look to see\nif there's any errors on it.\n\n327\n00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.740\nAnd it'll run, it'll go really fast for\nme because I'm on an SSD.\n\n328\n00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.960\nIf you're on a spinning disk,\n\n329\n00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.290\nit could actually take a little\nwhile as it runs through.\n\n330\n00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:16.500\nOr actually, you know what?\n\n331\n00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.420\nThis is USB, it ran really fast here\nbecause the disk is just mostly empty.\n\n332\n00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.180\n[LAUGH] And that speeds things up too.\n\n333\n00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.380\nSo it checked it out,\ndidn't find any errors.\n\n334\n00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.240\nI can look at the details and\nkinda see what it did.\n\n335\n00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.270\nAnd you'll see where it checked through\nthe software configuration, right?\n\n336\n00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:35.420\nThe boot region, the ExFAT table itself,\nthe file system check.\n\n337\n00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.690\nAnd it looked to see if\nthere was anything there.\n\n338\n00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.610\nIt didn't have to check permissions,\n\n339\n00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.920\nbecause there aren't any permissions,\nnot on this disk.\n\n340\n00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:49.140\nVersus, if I were to take something like\nmy extended, and run First Aid on that?\n\n341\n00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.280\nIt's gonna run fast also, cuz it's empty.\n\n342\n00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.126\nBut when I look at the details on this,\n\n343\n00:17:53.126 --> 00:17:57.370\nyou'll see where it's checking other\nthings like extended attributes.\n\n344\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.090\nWell, we don't have extended\nattributes under ExFAT.\n\n345\n00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.520\nThe extended attributes\nare where we store things like,\n\n346\n00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.220\nwhether it's tagged as a certain color,\nand our permissions, right?\n\n347\n00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.330\nSo that's part of it checking\nthat extra information,\n\n348\n00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:09.580\nto make sure the file is okay.\n\n349\n00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.810\nAnd so it looks at it,\nmakes sure everything is fine.\n\n350\n00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.610\nAnd hopefully, you see what I see.\n\n351\n00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.550\nThe operation was successful, and\neverything appears to be okay, right?\n\n352\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.040\nThat's what we want to see.\n\n353\n00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.760\nNow normally, I don't run this.\n\n354\n00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.980\nI don't say like, once a week,\nI'm gonna run this check.\n\n355\n00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.790\nYou don't do that, you just wait.\n\n356\n00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.340\nAnd if a problem happens, then you run it.\n\n357\n00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.252\nBut otherwise,\nthe Mac OS Extended Journaling system is,\n\n358\n00:18:30.252 --> 00:18:32.820\nit's self-maintaining,\nit takes car of itself.\n\n359\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.960\nIn the Windows world,\n\n360\n00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.900\nyou hear people talk about defragmenting\ntheir drives, you've gotta defragment.\n\n361\n00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.360\nWell these days, file systems like the Mac\nOS Extended Journal one self-defragment,\n\n362\n00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.450\nso we don't need to worry about it.\n\n363\n00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.920\nBut even if they were to fragment,\nif you're on an SSD?\n\n364\n00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.800\nSSDs don't care about fragmentation.\n\n365\n00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.073\nThey don't have to move an arm\nto different places on a drive,\n\n366\n00:18:50.073 --> 00:18:51.310\nwhich is what slows things down.\n\n367\n00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.340\nThey can just jump around and\nget what they want.\n\n368\n00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.640\nSo fragmentation's really\nnot a big deal anymore.\n\n369\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.540\nWe don't have to worry about it.\n\n370\n00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.349\nThere's no routine maintenance\nthat we need to be performing.\n\n371\n00:19:00.735 --> 00:19:03.613\nAll right, now there I was running\nthe disk check, the First Aid,\n\n372\n00:19:03.613 --> 00:19:04.703\non individual volumes.\n\n373\n00:19:04.703 --> 00:19:06.550\nBut you might need to run\nit on the disk itself.\n\n374\n00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:09.180\nIf I lose access to all the volumes,\nif they can't mount?\n\n375\n00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.400\nThen I may need to grab that whole disk.\n\n376\n00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.330\nAnd so what I can do is, in the Disk\nUtility, instead of clicking on a volume.\n\n377\n00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.470\nI can click on the disk itself,\nand run First Aid.\n\n378\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.840\nAnd when you do that,\nit's gonna run it on the physical disk.\n\n379\n00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.000\nThis will check the boot table.\n\n380\n00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.340\nRemember, the boot table on this one,\nactually I don't remember,\n\n381\n00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.130\ndid I pick GPT, yeah.\n\n382\n00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.770\nIt says it right there,\nGUID Partition Map, so I picked GPT.\n\n383\n00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:34.370\nSo it's going to look at the GPT,\nand make sure that it's intact.\n\n384\n00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.310\nAnd if there's volumes that are missing,\n\n385\n00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.530\nit'll try and rediscover them and\nadd them back to the table.\n\n386\n00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.400\nIt'll rebuild the table, if it has to.\n\n387\n00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.950\nAnd so that'll check it, and\nhopefully bring our volumes back online.\n\n388\n00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.530\nAgain, mine's just been formatted so\nI know it's safe.\n\n389\n00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.110\nBut if yours encounters any errors,\nyou'll see it.\n\n390\n00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.560\nAnd if I look here, I can see where\nit's checking the EFI system partition,\n\n391\n00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.090\nand the partition map.\n\n392\n00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:57.240\nIt's checking and\nlooking for any HFS data.\n\n393\n00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:02.200\nHFS is another name for what became\nthe Mac OS Extended Journal file system.\n\n394\n00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.340\nAnd then everything appears okay.\n\n395\n00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.650\nIt didn't check the volumes themselves,\nright?\n\n396\n00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.500\nIt checked the disk.\n\n397\n00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.790\nSo I might need to go and\ncontinue to run volume checks, also.\n\n398\n00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:14.860\nBut this one checked the disk.\n\n399\n00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.570\nIf you're ever missing\nall of your volumes,\n\n400\n00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:17.924\nthis is usually where you wanna go.\n\n401\n00:20:20.129 --> 00:20:20.700\nAll right?\n\n402\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.790\nAnd the reality is,\nif you boot your Mac up?\n\n403\n00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.750\nThe odds are, if there's a problem\non the disk, it'll find it and\n\n404\n00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.850\nit'll fix it for you.\n\n405\n00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.310\nThere is one time where\nit won't do that for you.\n\n406\n00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:35.320\nWhat if there's a problem with your\nsystem volume, where Mac OS is?\n\n407\n00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.730\nAnd it tries to boot up, and\nit can't even see the operating system and\n\n408\n00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.150\nit crashes out, right?\n\n409\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:39.960\nNow you can't boot your Mac.\n\n410\n00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.380\nIf you can't boot your Mac,\nhow are you gonna run First Aid?\n\n411\n00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.040\nWell, if you have a USB\nkey with Mac OS on it,\n\n412\n00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:52.020\nyou can plug that in, and boot off\nthe installer, and run First Aid that way.\n\n413\n00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.660\nOr, if you have two Macs?\n\n414\n00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.510\nThere's actually something called Target\nMode, that you can use to check the Mac.\n\n415\n00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.710\nSo for example, here on my desk,\nI've got a Mac Mini, right?\n\n416\n00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.950\nAnd this is the Mac Mini I used\nin one of the installation shows.\n\n417\n00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:05.790\nAnd so I've got this Mac Mini, but\n\n418\n00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.550\nI didn't have enough room here on the desk\nwith me to stick a monitor, right?\n\n419\n00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:12.070\nSo I just have it sitting right here and,\nif I don't have a monitor,\n\n420\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.920\nI can't see it to boot it, and\ntell it to go into recovery or whatever.\n\n421\n00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.584\nBut, let's just pretend that I couldn't\nboot it anyway, if I tried to boot it,\n\n422\n00:21:20.584 --> 00:21:21.830\nthen the operating system was dead.\n\n423\n00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:28.770\nWhat you can do is, if you boot a Mac\nwhile holding Cmd+T on your keyboard,\n\n424\n00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.450\nit'll boot into Target Mode.\n\n425\n00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.540\nAnd Target Mode turns it into\none big external hard drive.\n\n426\n00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:37.950\nIt says, don't boot Mac OS,\njust be an external hard drive, right?\n\n427\n00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.600\nIf I do that,\nI can hook this Mac to another Mac.\n\n428\n00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.210\nAnd the second Mac will see\nthe first one as a hard drive.\n\n429\n00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.020\nAnd now we can run First Aid on it.\n\n430\n00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.510\nSo let me show you how to do that.\n\n431\n00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.710\nOn most Macs,\nyou're going to have a Thunderbolt port.\n\n432\n00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.080\nAnd so we can take a cable like this one.\n\n433\n00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:58.000\nAnd if we get a close look at this cable,\nthis is a standard Thunderbolt cable.\n\n434\n00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.640\nSo it's got the display\nport connector on each end.\n\n435\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.330\nAnd it's got the little\nlightning bolt on it, so\n\n436\n00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.160\nI know it's not a display port cable,\nright.\n\n437\n00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.490\nIt's not for monitors,\nit's actually for Thunderbolt Storage.\n\n438\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:15.420\nAnd I can plug this in to the broken Mac,\nand my good Mac.\n\n439\n00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:20.470\nAnd then on my good Mac, it'll see\nthe broken Mac as a hard drive, and\n\n440\n00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.220\nI can run First Aid.\n\n441\n00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:28.190\nThis works great, except on the newest\nMacs, that only have USB-C.\n\n442\n00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:32.270\nAnd so for them,\nyou'll either need a USB-C to USB-C cable.\n\n443\n00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.970\nOr a USB-C to Thunderbolt cable,\nwhich they do sell.\n\n444\n00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.170\nThey're all very expensive.\n\n445\n00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:41.250\nIf you ever find a cheap Thunderbolt\ncable, it's not real, right.\n\n446\n00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.890\nThunderbolt cables are weird.\n\n447\n00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:48.230\nBecause there's actually a chip inside\nof each connector, that identifies them.\n\n448\n00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.020\nSo it's more than just copper wire,\n\n449\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.340\nthere is actually circuitry\ninside of this cable.\n\n450\n00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:57.460\nAnd that's why Thunderbolt\ncables normally cost $30 plus,\n\n451\n00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.240\nversus USB cables,\nyou can get for $0.20, right?\n\n452\n00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.380\nUSB cables don't actually\nhave any circuitry in them.\n\n453\n00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.240\nIt's just copper wire and that's it.\n\n454\n00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.840\nSo what I'm going to do is,\nI'm going to take this cable.\n\n455\n00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.390\nAnd the process that you\nwant to run through.\n\n456\n00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.810\nIs that you want to take your damaged Mac,\nor\n\n457\n00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.890\nthe one that is going to be\nthe hard drive, and shut it down.\n\n458\n00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.030\nOkay, so I've shut mine down, it's off.\n\n459\n00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.290\nIt needs to be off for this.\n\n460\n00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.740\nYou want to plug the cable in,\nwhile the Mac is off.\n\n461\n00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.270\nThat's the secret, this is the step\nthat everybody forgets, and\n\n462\n00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.770\nyou can't figure out why it's not working.\n\n463\n00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.500\nMake sure that you plug in\nthe cable in while it's off.\n\n464\n00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.990\nSo I'm gonna plug in the Thunderbolt\ncable into a Thunderbolt port\n\n465\n00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.580\non my Mac Mini, right here.\n\n466\n00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:37.500\nI'm gonna try, apparently this\nis the hard part, there we go.\n\n467\n00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.270\nAnd then I'm gonna take\nthe other end of the cable, and\n\n468\n00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.960\nI'm gonna plug it into my laptop,\ninto its Thunderbolt port.\n\n469\n00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.520\nAnd I'll plug it in.\n\n470\n00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.390\nNow at this point,\nmy laptop doesn't see this Mac Mini.\n\n471\n00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.711\nWell, cuz it's turned off, right?\n\n472\n00:23:50.711 --> 00:23:52.715\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I don't see that, but\n\n473\n00:23:52.715 --> 00:23:54.206\nthe cable is hooked up.\n\n474\n00:23:54.206 --> 00:23:57.963\nAnd now, I can break out the keyboard for\nthat Mac Mini.\n\n475\n00:23:57.963 --> 00:24:03.991\nAnd what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna turn\non the Mac Mini while holding Cmd+T, okay.\n\n476\n00:24:03.991 --> 00:24:09.479\nSo I'm holding Cmd+T, And\nI'm pushing that power button.\n\n477\n00:24:09.479 --> 00:24:10.850\nAnd I'm waiting patiently.\n\n478\n00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.629\n&gt;&gt; Hey Don, I don't think it's Cmd+T.\n\n479\n00:24:12.629 --> 00:24:15.672\nI think it's actually just\nthe letter t that you press down.\n\n480\n00:24:15.672 --> 00:24:16.178\n&gt;&gt; That's funny.\n\n481\n00:24:16.178 --> 00:24:17.270\nLAUGH] I think you're right.\n\n482\n00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.922\nSo, good point.\n\n483\n00:24:17.922 --> 00:24:22.925\n[LAUGH] I mix up some of my boot commands\nsometimes like, Cmd+R for recovery.\n\n484\n00:24:22.925 --> 00:24:26.440\nIt's not Cmd+T, it's actually just\nthe letter t for the target mode.\n\n485\n00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.470\nKinda like just d for\nthe diagnostic modes.\n\n486\n00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.580\nSome letters you have to do command,\nsome you don't.\n\n487\n00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.670\nOn this one, I don't have a monitor\nhooked up to this Mac mini.\n\n488\n00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.950\nSo, I'm not gonna know whether or not it\nboots into target mode or not properly.\n\n489\n00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:39.480\nSo it is important to hold the right key.\n\n490\n00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.860\nIf you have a monitor attached it's really\neasy to figure out if you got it right.\n\n491\n00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.160\nI'm gonna cut my power here so\nI can do it again.\n\n492\n00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.960\nAnd if you have a monitor hooked up and\nyou boot normally what do you see?\n\n493\n00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.864\nYou see the Apple logo, right?\n\n494\n00:24:48.864 --> 00:24:50.710\nAs it goes through boot process.\n\n495\n00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:54.380\nBut if you boot into target mode,\nwhat you should see,\n\n496\n00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.660\nthe way you'll know it worked is,\nI'm sorry I'm just booting that up again.\n\n497\n00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.030\nIs you'll see a thunderbolt.\n\n498\n00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.720\nYou'll see a lightning\nbolt appear on the screen.\n\n499\n00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.740\nNot the Apple logo, not the normal movie.\n\n500\n00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.410\nYou just straight up a little thunderbolt.\n\n501\n00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.540\nAnd it will move around the screen,\nkind of like a screen saver,\n\n502\n00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.710\nit moves very slowly.\n\n503\n00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.300\nBut that's how you know you\nsuccessfully booted into target mode.\n\n504\n00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.670\nSo I'm just rebooting,\nI'm holding that letter t.\n\n505\n00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.720\nNow that's one way we know\nthat we booted to target mode.\n\n506\n00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.280\nThe other way is it's\nconnected to my laptop, and so\n\n507\n00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.550\nwhat I should see shortly, oop,\nit's actually happening right now,\n\n508\n00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.160\nis I should see that drive\nappear on my desktop.\n\n509\n00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.450\nMy heads gonna cover it up\nbecause I have so many disks, but\n\n510\n00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:34.580\nif you look way down here at the bottom\nright, I've got another Macintosh HD.\n\n511\n00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.610\nUp here I've got Macintosh HD and\nsee how the icons are different?\n\n512\n00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:42.040\nOne's an internal disk,\none's an external disk, and\n\n513\n00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.550\nI can see that in my disk utility also.\n\n514\n00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:49.410\nI've got my Apple SSD that's internal\nto my laptop, that's my laptop's disk.\n\n515\n00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:52.970\nBut down here I've got an Apple HDD,\n\n516\n00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:58.350\na regular spinning disk,\nthat is a Macintosh HD for the Mac Mini.\n\n517\n00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:01.254\nAnd this is where you can kind\nof confuse things, right?\n\n518\n00:26:01.254 --> 00:26:05.224\nBecause I've got a 500 gig\nMacintosh HD in my laptop and\n\n519\n00:26:05.224 --> 00:26:10.740\nthis is a 500 gig Macintosh HD in\nthe Mac Mini, very easy to confuse them.\n\n520\n00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.260\nSo if you're about to format or partition\nthe disk you want to make sure you're\n\n521\n00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.570\npicking the right disk\nas you work with it.\n\n522\n00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.310\nBut more importantly,\nthis Mac is on a target mode,\n\n523\n00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:24.870\nI can see its hard drive from my laptop,\nand I can run first aid.\n\n524\n00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.340\nSo this Mac might not be able to boot up,\nright?\n\n525\n00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:31.220\nThe operating system might be completely\nfried, or I've got damaged files and\n\n526\n00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.430\nI just want to kind of get it fresh and\nclean.\n\n527\n00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.040\nI could run first aid, or\nI could straight up erase it.\n\n528\n00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.000\nI can just say, you know what,\nlet me erase this disk.\n\n529\n00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.480\nAnd then I'll go and\nreinstall MacOS on it.\n\n530\n00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.720\nI'll boot off a USB key or something.\n\n531\n00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.260\nOr we could even copy\nthe system folder over or\n\n532\n00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.890\nwhatever it is that we needed to do\nto get that system up and going.\n\n533\n00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:53.820\nBut I can work with it now and\ndo all that right from here because that\n\n534\n00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.890\nextra machine is really just a fancy, very\nexpensive external hard drive right now.\n\n535\n00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:03.600\nAnd then if I turn it off and\nI go and boot the system back up,\n\n536\n00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.930\nit'll boot into MacOS, then it'll run,\nit'll be a normal machine.\n\n537\n00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:09.980\nAnd see how this scan is taking a lot\nlonger to run than when I was scanning\n\n538\n00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.060\nmy system?\n\n539\n00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.936\nWell, my system was an SSD,\nthis is an HDD.\n\n540\n00:27:14.936 --> 00:27:15.821\nIt's slower.\n\n541\n00:27:15.821 --> 00:27:18.798\nIt's also being done via Thunderbolt\ninstead of my internal SATA bus, so\n\n542\n00:27:18.798 --> 00:27:20.248\nthat takes a little bit longer too.\n\n543\n00:27:20.248 --> 00:27:23.008\nBut it's scanning through and\nactually it did find a problem,\n\n544\n00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:25.460\nfound an invalid volume three block count,\nright?\n\n545\n00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.460\nAnd so it repaired the volume and\nre-checked it, right?\n\n546\n00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.590\nSo it's testing and fixing things up,\n\n547\n00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.868\nand it shows that it was\nrepaired successfully, right?\n\n548\n00:27:33.868 --> 00:27:37.350\nSo first aide's able to repair that and\nnow I can get in and\n\n549\n00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.279\nstart to use that disk.\n\n550\n00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:44.119\nNow one of the key ways that we avoid\ndamaging a disk is that if we're about to\n\n551\n00:27:44.119 --> 00:27:47.170\ndisconnect the disk,\nwe need to unmount it, right?\n\n552\n00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:51.230\nAnd the easy way to unmount it is just\nto drag it and drop it in the trash.\n\n553\n00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:54.720\nAnd so again, if I want to unhook\nthis one, I'll take the MacIntosh HD,\n\n554\n00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.980\nI'm just gonna drag that.\n\n555\n00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.830\nAnd I'll go into my dock here and\nI'll drop that into the trash.\n\n556\n00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:03.850\nSee how the trash changes to a little\neject button instead of the trash?\n\n557\n00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:07.380\nAnd then I can eject it and\nit'll properly unmount the disk.\n\n558\n00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.510\nThat's really important for\n\n559\n00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:12.810\nthings like this fat drive right here,\nthat this fat drive is very sensitive.\n\n560\n00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.800\nIf I just eject it, it's gonna break.\n\n561\n00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.550\nBut if I drop it here,\nit will properly eject.\n\n562\n00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.680\nNow when it does that,\n\n563\n00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.674\nit's gonna recognize it as one partition\nof a multi-partition disk, right?\n\n564\n00:28:23.674 --> 00:28:25.530\nThere's more than one volume on that disk.\n\n565\n00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:28.520\nSo do I want to eject them all,\nor just this one?\n\n566\n00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.560\nAnd I can choose eject all, and\nthat will knock them out and\n\n567\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.230\nget them safely unmounted.\n\n568\n00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:38.805\nNow it is possible a program could be\nholding open one of these partitions,\n\n569\n00:28:38.805 --> 00:28:39.321\nright?\n\n570\n00:28:39.321 --> 00:28:41.936\nAnd if I try and inject one, so for\n\n571\n00:28:41.936 --> 00:28:47.463\nexample I'm gonna just unhook that\ndrive and plug it back in, right?\n\n572\n00:28:47.463 --> 00:28:50.400\nAnd once it's plugged back in\nit'll remount those disks.\n\n573\n00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.520\nSo I could have remounted\nfrom the disk utility also.\n\n574\n00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.590\nBut what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go into my terminal and\n\n575\n00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.800\nI'm gonna go into Volume/FAT, and\n\n576\n00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:06.142\nmaybe I'll start editing a file\nhere inside of that folder.\n\n577\n00:29:06.142 --> 00:29:10.029\nAll right, so\nI'm now working inside of that volume,\n\n578\n00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:12.826\ninside of the one that's labeled FAT.\n\n579\n00:29:12.826 --> 00:29:15.379\nAnd if I take that FAT volume and\ndrag it, and\n\n580\n00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:18.790\nI'm gonna drop it down here\nonto my eject button, right?\n\n581\n00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:22.281\nIt's gonna warn me, well,\nthat it's just one of four, but\n\n582\n00:29:22.281 --> 00:29:24.342\nI'll eject just this one, right?\n\n583\n00:29:24.342 --> 00:29:28.952\nAnd when I eject it,\nit's showing that it's in use, right?\n\n584\n00:29:28.952 --> 00:29:31.220\nThe terminal is holding it in use.\n\n585\n00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.720\nI need to quit that application and\ntry to eject the disc again.\n\n586\n00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.120\nOk, now,\n\n587\n00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.190\nthe reason it's showing me this is because\nmacOS is aware of the terminal app.\n\n588\n00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.740\nIt knows that it's running and healthy and\n\n589\n00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.390\nI just need to go and\nend what I was doing before I eject.\n\n590\n00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:49.340\nIf I just eject right now I could have\ndamaged files, partially written files.\n\n591\n00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.210\nSometimes, macOS can't talk to\nthe application that's doing it.\n\n592\n00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.590\nAnd if it can't,\nit assumes the application is locked.\n\n593\n00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:00.170\nAnd if that happens there'll be another\nbutton that appears here that says\n\n594\n00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:01.650\nforce eject.\n\n595\n00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.150\nForce eject, we say forget it.\n\n596\n00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:06.160\nJust forget that application.\n\n597\n00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.830\nLet's just eject the drive.\n\n598\n00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.970\nAnd when that happens the odds of\nyou having damaged files goes up\n\n599\n00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:12.030\nsignificantly.\n\n600\n00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.860\nSo you want to make sure that you\nproperly eject whenever you can.\n\n601\n00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.880\nIn this case I just need\nto say okay to that and\n\n602\n00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.540\nget out of my terminal application here.\n\n603\n00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.820\nAnd once I'm out of that,\nnow I should be able to come over here and\n\n604\n00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.900\neject that FAT disk.\n\n605\n00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.530\nI'll just drag it and\ndrop it back down here again.\n\n606\n00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:32.920\nAnd eject it, and now it'll properly\neject and not complain, right?\n\n607\n00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.810\nSo you always wanna make\nsure that you safely unmount\n\n608\n00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.640\ndisks when you're done with them.\n\n609\n00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.620\nAnd that way your files\nwon't become corrupted.\n\n610\n00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.050\nAll right, well, I think that pretty\nmuch wraps up everything that we\n\n611\n00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.270\nneed to talk about on file storage.\n\n612\n00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.370\nWe still have some security and\n\n613\n00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:46.640\npermissions that we're\ngonna talk about later.\n\n614\n00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.430\nBut for right now, this is a pretty\ngood stopping point on this one.\n\n615\n00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.030\nAnd we had a great chance to\nlearn about the different\n\n616\n00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:53.930\nfile systems that we can drop on there.\n\n617\n00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:56.650\nAnd even the target mode that we\ncan use to help troubleshoot and\n\n618\n00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.700\nrepair other Macs.\n\n619\n00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.880\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, well,\nthank you again for helping us to\n\n620\n00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.420\nunderstand a little bit more about some\nof those different file systems and\n\n621\n00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.000\nthe choices that are before us.\n\n622\n00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.920\nAs well as showing us\nthe ability to use disk utility\n\n623\n00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.900\nto help us with issues that may arise.\n\n624\n00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.220\nAnd of course even to see how\nthose volumes are broken up.\n\n625\n00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.440\nBut that's a great place for\nus to sign off.\n\n626\n00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.660\nFor IT Pro TV I've been\nyour host Ronnie Wong.\n\n627\n00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:20.700\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n628\n00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:25.208\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n629\n00:31:25.208 -->

00:00:07.948\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:12.465\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:14.051\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.051 --> 00:00:18.564\nYou're watching Apple Certified Support\nProfessional for Mac OS Sierra.\n\n7\n00:00:18.564 --> 00:00:22.229\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe'll be learning about securing data.\n\n8\n00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:24.924\nAnd here to help us to understand\nthat better is gonna be Mr Don Pezet,\n\n9\n00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.400\nDon welcome back to the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.325\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back Ronnie,\n\n11\n00:00:27.325 --> 00:00:30.110\nand we're gonna continue on\nour storage conversations.\n\n12\n00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.230\nAnd talk a little bit about ways that\nwe can secure our data on the drive.\n\n13\n00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.430\nNow there are actually two main techniques\navailable for securing our data.\n\n14\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.590\nOne is encryption and one is permission.\n\n15\n00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.000\nAnd we're gonna talk\npermissions in a later episode.\n\n16\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.317\nRight here, we're gonna be more focused\non encryption and data recovery.\n\n17\n00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:49.401\nOne of the big fears or problems\nthat you have with a mobile device,\n\n18\n00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:50.680\nlike my laptop right here.\n\n19\n00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.236\nI could store a lot of personal and\n\n20\n00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:55.020\nprivate information\nright here in my laptop.\n\n21\n00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.145\nAnd then I get in a cab and\nI leave the laptop on the cab.\n\n22\n00:00:59.145 --> 00:00:59.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I forget, or\n\n23\n00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.910\nI'm sitting in an airport and somebody\nruns by and snatches my laptop and runs.\n\n24\n00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.840\nWell, they got my laptop, right.\n\n25\n00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.540\nWell, all right, at least I know\nthey don't have my password.\n\n26\n00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.157\nThey can't log in as me, or can they?\n\n27\n00:01:11.157 --> 00:01:14.490\nBack in some of the earlier episodes\nwe talked about the firmware password.\n\n28\n00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.309\nAnd how if there's no firmware password\nset, they can boot to recovery, and\n\n29\n00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:20.160\nthey can reset my password.\n\n30\n00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.300\nNow they can log into my computer as me,\nand have access to all my stuff.\n\n31\n00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.950\nMy data is no longer safe.\n\n32\n00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.828\nAnd so the way we protect from\nthat is by encrypting our data and\n\n33\n00:01:29.828 --> 00:01:32.760\nthe best way to do that\nis through file vault.\n\n34\n00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.060\nNow file vault is not a new technology,\n\n35\n00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.170\nwe talked about it in\nan earlier episode also.\n\n36\n00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.408\nIt was introduced a long time ago,\n\n37\n00:01:39.408 --> 00:01:43.045\nI think it was OS 10.4 that\nactually introduced it.\n\n38\n00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:46.069\nBut it ran for several years.\n\n39\n00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.634\nThe way it worked is it would\nencrypt your home directory.\n\n40\n00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:50.682\nSo it would take your home directory,\nyour files, and\n\n41\n00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:52.158\nit would encrypt it with a private key.\n\n42\n00:01:52.158 --> 00:01:55.810\nNow, if I had a shared computer,\nmaybe Ronnie and I shared a laptop.\n\n43\n00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.380\nHis home folder could be encrypted and\nmine could be encrypted.\n\n44\n00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.490\nOr I might encrypt mine and\nhe might not encrypt his.\n\n45\n00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.200\nWe would kind of pick.\n\n46\n00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.580\nBut it encrypts your home folder and\neverybody's encrypted separately.\n\n47\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.781\nOn a positive side, it makes it so every\nuser has their own key, so that's nice.\n\n48\n00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:09.585\nBut on a negative side,\n\n49\n00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:15.010\nif I save something outside of my\nhome folder then it's not encrypted.\n\n50\n00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.135\nAnd if somebody gets my laptop\nthey could boot it in target mode.\n\n51\n00:02:18.135 --> 00:02:19.770\nHold T while we boot.\n\n52\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.550\nHook it up as external storage mode\nin computer browse right in and\n\n53\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.740\naccess the data.\n\n54\n00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.886\nThey wouldn't be able to get\ninto my home directory, but\n\n55\n00:02:25.886 --> 00:02:27.726\nthey'd be able to get everything else,\nright?\n\n56\n00:02:27.726 --> 00:02:32.918\nSo starting with OS 10.6,\nApple replaced the old File Vault.\n\n57\n00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:36.181\nFile Vault version 1 is now\ncalled the Legacy File Vault, and\n\n58\n00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:38.770\nit's been replaced with\nFile Vault version 2.\n\n59\n00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.810\nFile Vault version 2 encrypts your\nentire disk, the whole thing.\n\n60\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.360\nThe operating system, your home directory,\nthe files that are in and\n\n61\n00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.190\nout of your own directory;\nit gets the whole thing.\n\n62\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.358\nAnd that's the best level of protection.\n\n63\n00:02:53.358 --> 00:02:55.439\nIf somebody physically\nsteals your equipment.\n\n64\n00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.984\nEven if they rip the hard drives out and\npop them in their own computer,\n\n65\n00:02:57.984 --> 00:02:59.900\nthey still aren't gonna be\nable to access the data.\n\n66\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.360\nThe entire thing's encrypted.\n\n67\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.810\nThat is where you want to be.\n\n68\n00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.660\nNow I mentioned that in\nan earlier episode but\n\n69\n00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.710\nwhat we didn't do is actually\nimplement file vault.\n\n70\n00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.380\nSo in this episode I want to show you\nguys how we implement file vault and\n\n71\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.040\nget our system protected and encrypt it.\n\n72\n00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.020\nSo I’ve got a new machine here,\nit's up and it's running MacOS Sierra.\n\n73\n00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.866\nI haven't really done anything to\nmess with it, it’s just up and\n\n74\n00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:21.758\nrunning and happy.\n\n75\n00:03:21.758 --> 00:03:26.027\nAnd this is really one of the best\ntimes to encrypt the system.\n\n76\n00:03:26.027 --> 00:03:30.297\nBecause when we encrypt it if you've got a\nton of data on your system it's gonna take\n\n77\n00:03:30.297 --> 00:03:31.528\na long time to encrypt.\n\n78\n00:03:31.528 --> 00:03:34.887\nRight I just went through this with a\nlaptop the other day where it had an SSD.\n\n79\n00:03:34.887 --> 00:03:37.860\nIt was very fast and\nit had a ton of data on it.\n\n80\n00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.628\nIt had probably 300 gigs of data.\n\n81\n00:03:39.628 --> 00:03:43.232\nWell it took a solid eight hours to\nencrypt that laptop, it took a while.\n\n82\n00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:46.820\nBut on a system that doesn't have a ton\nof data it encrypts pretty quick.\n\n83\n00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.470\nAnd the reason is where our data resides,\nthat obviously needs to be encrypted.\n\n84\n00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.190\nBut the empty space is empty.\n\n85\n00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.090\nAnd so\nit can write zero bytes out to those.\n\n86\n00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.610\nAnd it does that pretty quickly.\n\n87\n00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.810\nAnd now your disk is encrypted.\n\n88\n00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.070\nWe can actually choose to\nencrypt the entire thing,\n\n89\n00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.340\neven the empty space if you want.\n\n90\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.470\nIt's much more thorough,\nbut it does take longer.\n\n91\n00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.350\nBut encrypting the drive in the early days\nis gonna make things go a little faster.\n\n92\n00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.350\nNow even if you didn't though,\nyou can turn it on at any point,\n\n93\n00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.740\njust make sure you set aside some time.\n\n94\n00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.660\nYou can use your device\nwhile it's encrypting,\n\n95\n00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.380\nit's just gonna be a little slow, right.\n\n96\n00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.030\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n97\n00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.620\nSo I'm gonna go into my system\npreferences on this system.\n\n98\n00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.100\nI'll go into my Apple menu and\nSystem Preferences.\n\n99\n00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.480\nAnd inside of System Preferences I'm\ngoing to go to Security and Privacy.\n\n100\n00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.250\nAnd inside Security and Privacy I'm\ngoing to go to the File Vault tab.\n\n101\n00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.310\nNow if your system was upgraded\n\n102\n00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.600\nfrom 10.6 to earlier it upgraded\nall the way up to Sierra.\n\n103\n00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.845\nFirst off, that's amazing.\n\n104\n00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:45.430\n[LAUGH] Not a lot of\nhardware is gonna do that.\n\n105\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.200\nBut if you did you might actually\nhave the Legacy File Vault turned on,\n\n106\n00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.240\nyou would see another tab here\nthat says Legacy File Vault.\n\n107\n00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.242\nIf you see that, step one for\n\n108\n00:04:54.242 --> 00:04:58.679\nyou needs to be to go to\nthe Legacy File Vault tab and turn it off.\n\n109\n00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:00.909\nTurn it off, that'll decrypt your data.\n\n110\n00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.220\nAnd then you'll continue with these\nsteps just like everybody else.\n\n111\n00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.100\nBut you need to turn off legacy\nFileVault if you already have it.\n\n112\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.560\nLegacy FileVault is only supported under\nSierra if you already had it configured.\n\n113\n00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.750\nYou can't actually turn on\nlegacy FileVault in the newer\n\n114\n00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.390\nversions of MacOS ever since template six.\n\n115\n00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.810\nSo I'm gonna go to FileVault.\n\n116\n00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.355\nAnd here's it's just warning me.\n\n117\n00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:22.038\nIt's saying FileVault is turned off for\nthe disk Mac-HD.\n\n118\n00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:24.582\nIt's off by default.\n\n119\n00:05:24.582 --> 00:05:26.299\nI need to turn it on.\n\n120\n00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:30.132\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nclick the lock here to unlock this tool.\n\n121\n00:05:30.132 --> 00:05:34.690\nAnd once it's unlocked, I'll be able\nto click the Turn On File Vault button.\n\n122\n00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.369\nNow there is another button down here\nat the bottom that says Advanced.\n\n123\n00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:43.263\nAnd if you click on Advanced,\nit's just saying here.\n\n124\n00:05:43.263 --> 00:05:45.371\nIf you wanna log out after\na certain amount of inactivity,\n\n125\n00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:47.780\nit's talking about\nthe administrative privileges here.\n\n126\n00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.790\nWe actually don't have a whole lot of\nfeatures here as far as File Vault itself.\n\n127\n00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.970\nWhen you go to turn it on,\nit's just the one button.\n\n128\n00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.180\nAnd then it asks about where we\nwanna store our recovery key.\n\n129\n00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.230\nSo it's a very simple process to get\nthat turned on, just one button.\n\n130\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.920\nWe hit that one button and\nthen we pick about the recovery key.\n\n131\n00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.980\nNow the recovery key is important.\n\n132\n00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.770\nEvery time my computer boots up\nit needs access to a private key.\n\n133\n00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.280\nThe private key is allowed\nto decrypt the hard drive.\n\n134\n00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.340\nI can't use the hard drive unless\nI can decrypt what's on it.\n\n135\n00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.200\nSo I need the private key.\n\n136\n00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.250\nWell the private key is actually stored in\nwhat's called a trusted platform module or\n\n137\n00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.140\nTPM.\n\n138\n00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.200\nIt's a chip that's located\non your motherboard.\n\n139\n00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.140\nIt's physically a part of your laptop.\n\n140\n00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.860\nIf somebody rips your hard drive out and\n\n141\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.210\nplugs it into another computer,\nit'll have your TPM.\n\n142\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.720\nThey can't decrypt it.\n\n143\n00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.520\nBut if they have your entire laptop,\nthey have the TPM also.\n\n144\n00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.110\nSo the TPM is locked.\n\n145\n00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.450\nAnd the TPM gets unlocked when you\nput in your username and password.\n\n146\n00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.585\nWhen you log into your laptop, your\nusername and password unlocks the TPM,\n\n147\n00:06:49.585 --> 00:06:51.340\nthat Trusted Platform Module.\n\n148\n00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:57.310\nNow, if I forget my password,\nwhat happens?\n\n149\n00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.190\nIf I forget my password,\nI can't unlock the TPM.\n\n150\n00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.780\nIf I can't unlock the TPM,\nI can't get private key.\n\n151\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.610\nAnd if I can't get the private key,\nI can't decrypt the hard drive.\n\n152\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.225\nI just lost all of my data, it's awesome.\n\n153\n00:07:07.225 --> 00:07:10.650\n[LAUGH] And so, if we want to prevent\nthat, if you're worried about forgetting\n\n154\n00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.090\nyour password,\nwe need to have some kind of backup plan.\n\n155\n00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.130\nAnd that's what this screen\nis kind of telling me here.\n\n156\n00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.116\nI can have a backup plan.\n\n157\n00:07:16.116 --> 00:07:18.768\nI can link to my iCloud account.\n\n158\n00:07:18.768 --> 00:07:21.940\nAnd if I do that, now if I forget\nmy password, I can just go and\n\n159\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.380\nreset my password through iCloud.\n\n160\n00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.110\nAnd then I'll be able to log in,\nand I'll be just fine.\n\n161\n00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.920\nBut if I don't wanna store this in iCloud,\nright?\n\n162\n00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.810\nMaybe I wanna keep it private, just to me.\n\n163\n00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.060\nMaybe I'm worried about\nApple getting subpoenaed and\n\n164\n00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.520\nthen turning over my key, right?\n\n165\n00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.410\nSo I might choose to create\na recovery key myself and\n\n166\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.860\nthen I can take that key and\nI can store it wherever I want.\n\n167\n00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.108\nThe key is just a long code,\nwe'll see mine here in just a minute, and\n\n168\n00:07:45.108 --> 00:07:47.294\nyou can write it down and\nstick it in the vault.\n\n169\n00:07:47.294 --> 00:07:51.718\nOr you can save it to some alternative\ncloud storage that you think is safe or\n\n170\n00:07:51.718 --> 00:07:53.695\nyou can put it wherever you want.\n\n171\n00:07:53.695 --> 00:07:57.275\nWhere you don't want to\nput it is on this machine.\n\n172\n00:07:57.275 --> 00:07:59.130\nBecause if I forget my password,\nI can't decrypt the drive.\n\n173\n00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.728\nIf I can't decrypt the drive,\nI can't get to my recovery key and\n\n174\n00:08:02.728 --> 00:08:04.070\nthat's when I need it.\n\n175\n00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.770\nSo it needs to be stored somewhere else.\n\n176\n00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.050\nBut it needs to be stored safely, because\nif somebody gets a hold on your recovery\n\n177\n00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.010\nkey, they can decrypt your drive\nwhich defeats the whole process.\n\n178\n00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.130\nSo I'm gonna choose to create a recovery\nkey and not use an iCloud account.\n\n179\n00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.990\nAnd when I move forward,\nhere's my key, right?\n\n180\n00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.690\nNow notice there's no save button here.\n\n181\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.080\nI can't just save it to my hard drive,\ncuz it doesn't want me to do that.\n\n182\n00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.990\nI can copy it, right, if I highlight here,\nI can copy it and paste it.\n\n183\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.000\nDo not email it to yourself.\n\n184\n00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.480\nA lot of people are like,\nI'll just email it to myself.\n\n185\n00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.310\nEmail is sent in plain text by default.\n\n186\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.580\nPeople can intercept that.\n\n187\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.164\nIt's not a safe way to transmit this key.\n\n188\n00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:47.050\nBut you may have something like\na secure note in last pass, right?\n\n189\n00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.130\nThose are encrypted notes\nthat are stored there.\n\n190\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.940\nYou might have other Cloud storage.\n\n191\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.690\nYou might want to print this out, and\n\n192\n00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.640\nnow it's a piece of paper that you\nstick in a vault safe somewhere.\n\n193\n00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.240\nYou can go ahead and do that, just\ndon't save it to this computer, right?\n\n194\n00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.320\nNow I'm not gonna save mine.\n\n195\n00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.020\nAnd that's actually a bit of a problem,\n\n196\n00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.520\nbecause this is the only\ntime I will see this key.\n\n197\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.630\nThe moment I move forward, that's it.\n\n198\n00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.420\nWell technically that's not true,\nI can hit back, right?\n\n199\n00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.641\nBut the moment I complete this wizard,\nthat's it,\n\n200\n00:09:15.641 --> 00:09:18.020\nthey'll never show me that key again,\nright?\n\n201\n00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.720\nSo that was my one chance to\nget that key and document it.\n\n202\n00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.170\nThis is a lab machine, so\nI don't care about it.\n\n203\n00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.470\nSo I'm not really worried, but\non any kind of production machine,\n\n204\n00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.450\nI would definitely document that.\n\n205\n00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.830\nAll right, the other thing is\nwhen this computer boots up,\n\n206\n00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.240\nsomebody has to unlock the TPM.\n\n207\n00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.270\nAnd by default,\nI'm gonna be that somebody.\n\n208\n00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:40.852\nI'm logged in as the help desk user, I'm\nan administrator, I can unlock the TPM,\n\n209\n00:09:40.852 --> 00:09:42.626\nnobody else can unlock the TPM.\n\n210\n00:09:42.626 --> 00:09:45.189\nBut if this is a shared computer like,\nI've got Samantha Jones here.\n\n211\n00:09:45.189 --> 00:09:50.640\nIf Samantha needs to unlock it well she\ncan't, cuz I'm the one who locked it.\n\n212\n00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.454\nBut I can enable other users.\n\n213\n00:09:52.454 --> 00:09:55.319\nAnd what we're doing here is each\nuser has their own password, right?\n\n214\n00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:57.140\nYou've got a username and a password.\n\n215\n00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.070\nAnd we're basically saying,\nwho do we want to allow to unlock the TPM?\n\n216\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.630\nThere's only one private key, there's one\nprivate key that decrypts the hard drive.\n\n217\n00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.170\nBut that private key is in a lock box,\nit's in this TPM,\n\n218\n00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.750\nand I can enable other users\nto be able to unlock it.\n\n219\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.890\nAnd when I do that,\nI need to put in their password.\n\n220\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.340\nI'm entering the account password for\nSamantha Jones,\n\n221\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.800\nto basically add her to the people\nthat are allowed to open the TPM.\n\n222\n00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.750\nWhen somebody resets their password,\nthey'll have to update this value.\n\n223\n00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.830\nBut I can punch that in, or I might have\nto go and get Samantha and say, come here.\n\n224\n00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.600\nI need you to type in your password.\n\n225\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.050\nAnd she can punch it in, and\nthen we can approve her.\n\n226\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.990\nAnd now both of us are able\nto unlock the TPM.\n\n227\n00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.090\nSo the operating system can\nget the private key and\n\n228\n00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.820\nthen decrypt the rest of the hard drive.\n\n229\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.740\nSo you can pick and\nchoose how many users you want to enable.\n\n230\n00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.170\nYou won't see this screen if\nyou only have one user account.\n\n231\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.100\nThis screen won't up.\n\n232\n00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.420\nI had two, so I get to see the choices.\n\n233\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.620\nAnd you might have 20 users, right,\nand you'd pick and choose each one.\n\n234\n00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.670\nAnd we can always add more\npeople after the fact.\n\n235\n00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.620\nSo maybe I create a new user account\nnext week, and I can come in and\n\n236\n00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.510\nI can add that to this list.\n\n237\n00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.350\nYou can come back and edit that.\n\n238\n00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.940\nAll right, after that it needs to\nrestart to begin the encryption process.\n\n239\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.675\nNow it's actually kinda\ninteresting what it does here.\n\n240\n00:11:08.675 --> 00:11:10.545\nIt could just start encrypting the drive.\n\n241\n00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.491\nBut there's a lot of files\nthat are currently in use and\n\n242\n00:11:12.491 --> 00:11:14.660\nfiles that are locked,\njust not gonna have access to those.\n\n243\n00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.137\nBut the other thing is, it doesn't\nactually know this is gonna work.\n\n244\n00:11:17.137 --> 00:11:18.598\nThere's a chance it could fail.\n\n245\n00:11:18.598 --> 00:11:20.846\nYou don't wanna start encrypting\nyour drive and then it fails, and\n\n246\n00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:22.830\nnow you've got some data you can't access.\n\n247\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.120\nSo instead, what it does is it\nruns a very, very quick test.\n\n248\n00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.990\nIt does encrypt a very small\namount of temporary data.\n\n249\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.430\nAnd it's gonna reboot, so\n\n250\n00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.820\nit can hook into the files that\nare normally in use to encrypt those.\n\n251\n00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.740\nAnd it will do a test decryption of that\ntemporary data to make sure encryption,\n\n252\n00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.240\ndecryption is working.\n\n253\n00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.970\nIf it doesn't work, it will stop before\nit messes with any of your data.\n\n254\n00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.030\nSo this is a very safe process.\n\n255\n00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.330\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit restart,\nand the system is gonna reboot.\n\n256\n00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:53.178\nNow when it reboots, it's not gonna\nlook all that different to me, right?\n\n257\n00:11:53.178 --> 00:11:56.275\nThe screen is gonna go black,\nor I'm in a virtual machine, so\n\n258\n00:11:56.275 --> 00:11:57.594\nthe screens gonna go dim.\n\n259\n00:11:57.594 --> 00:12:01.710\n[LAUGH] And then I'll see my Apple menu as\nit starts to go through the boot process.\n\n260\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.940\nThe boot process is gonna\nrun pretty smoothly, right?\n\n261\n00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.190\nWe'll see our Apple logo, and\nthen I get to my login bubbles, right?\n\n262\n00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:13.060\nBut it is a little bit different,\ncuz normally I would see an Apple logo and\n\n263\n00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.980\nthe little status bar crawling along,\nokay?\n\n264\n00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:21.390\nWhat's going on here is this\nis not my normal logon screen.\n\n265\n00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.340\nThis is the login screen for file vault.\n\n266\n00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.240\nThis is being brought up before the OS is\nloaded, because the OS is encrypted, or\n\n267\n00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.020\nit will be encrypted soon.\n\n268\n00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:34.860\nSo here this is a chance for\nme to put in my key to unlock the TPM.\n\n269\n00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.940\nThat's what I'm doing here\nis unlocking the TPM,\n\n270\n00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.410\nnot logging into the operating system.\n\n271\n00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.050\nNow it does cache my credentials, so it\nwill automatically log me in in a minute.\n\n272\n00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.700\nSo it's a seamless\nprocess to the end user.\n\n273\n00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.440\nTo the end user, all they notice is that\nthis screen comes up before the Apple,\n\n274\n00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.290\ninstead of after the Apple\nlike they're used to.\n\n275\n00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:55.060\nSo I'm gonna come in and log in as me, and\n\n276\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.520\nnow it can unlock the TPM, and\nnow it does the boot process.\n\n277\n00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.390\nSo I see my little status bar crawling\nacross the screen like I'm used to.\n\n278\n00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.971\nAnd that's gonna move across, and\nthen it's gonna boot the operating system.\n\n279\n00:13:05.971 --> 00:13:07.358\nNow it's not done,\n\n280\n00:13:07.358 --> 00:13:12.020\nwhen it boots into the OS I can start\nusing the computer like normal.\n\n281\n00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.845\nBut in the background it finished its\ntest, it knows encryption is working,\n\n282\n00:13:16.845 --> 00:13:19.751\nand now it's gonna start\nencrypting my data.\n\n283\n00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:23.997\nAnd that process might take 10 minutes,\nit might take 2 hours.\n\n284\n00:13:23.997 --> 00:13:27.067\nIt might take 10 hours depending\non how much data I have,\n\n285\n00:13:27.067 --> 00:13:32.440\nit's gonna go through and start encrypting\nthat information and it may take hours.\n\n286\n00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.146\nAnd while it's doing that it's okay,\nthe screens gonna reset here and\n\n287\n00:13:36.146 --> 00:13:38.204\nthen it's gonna hit the normal login.\n\n288\n00:13:38.204 --> 00:13:40.305\nAlmost, almost there, there we go.\n\n289\n00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:42.054\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n290\n00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:42.793\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And see how it,\n\n291\n00:13:42.793 --> 00:13:45.920\nit logged me in the rest of the way I\ndidn't have to put in my password twice.\n\n292\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.430\nAnd now it comes in here and it lets me\nknow that file vault is enabled, right,\n\n293\n00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.600\nI am secure.\n\n294\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.290\nOur recovery key has been set, but\nit's in the process of encrypting.\n\n295\n00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.160\nAnd the cool thing here is\nI can just ignore that,\n\n296\n00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.250\nleave it in the background, right?\n\n297\n00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.870\nYou can even close this window,\nit's fine, right?\n\n298\n00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.640\nAnd now I can use\nthe computer like normal.\n\n299\n00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.749\nIt will be a little bit slower, because\nthe disk is thrashing right now, right,\n\n300\n00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:07.272\nit's doing all this stuff on the disk.\n\n301\n00:14:07.272 --> 00:14:10.228\nBut I can use the computer like normal And\nin a couple hours,\n\n302\n00:14:10.228 --> 00:14:12.192\nit will be done, it will be encrypted.\n\n303\n00:14:12.192 --> 00:14:16.625\nAnd now, every bit of data I write to this\ndisk, I know will be safe and protected,\n\n304\n00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:19.020\nif somebody steals the laptop, I'm fine.\n\n305\n00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:19.553\nI know my data's safe.\n\n306\n00:14:19.553 --> 00:14:22.019\nI'm mean,\nI'm not fine I lost my laptop, but\n\n307\n00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:24.816\nat least I know my data's not compromised,\nright?\n\n308\n00:14:24.816 --> 00:14:28.834\nAnd then at any point I can go back\ninto my system preferences- And\n\n309\n00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:32.100\nI can go back into Security and Privacy.\n\n310\n00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.640\nAnd back to the file vault tab, and\nwe can verify that progress right?\n\n311\n00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.062\nSo use it like normal and\njust wait for it to encrypt.\n\n312\n00:14:40.062 --> 00:14:43.505\nNow at this point I'm encrypting my\ninternal hard drive If you use USB drives,\n\n313\n00:14:43.505 --> 00:14:46.497\nlike Time Machine drives especially\nyou may want to encrypt those.\n\n314\n00:14:46.497 --> 00:14:49.314\nAlso Time Machine has\nthe ability to do encryption, so\n\n315\n00:14:49.314 --> 00:14:51.530\nyou'll set that up through Time Machine.\n\n316\n00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.196\nAnd we'll see that in\nanother episode as well, but\n\n317\n00:14:54.196 --> 00:14:58.480\nat this point it's encrypting my system\nvolume, and I know that data is now safe.\n\n318\n00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.500\nAll right,\nnow that's one side of securing data.\n\n319\n00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.250\nThe other side is, what if I'm about\nto get rid of some data, right?\n\n320\n00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.570\nSo for example I've got this USB hard\ndrive that I've been using in the show,\n\n321\n00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.460\nand maybe I've finished using it and\nI've decided I'm gonna give it to Ronnie.\n\n322\n00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.230\nRight, here you go Ronnie,\nyou can have this disk.\n\n323\n00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:23.040\nWell there is forensic software out there\nthat you can run, that will scan a disk,\n\n324\n00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.750\nand look for deleted softwares,\ndeleted files and it will recover them.\n\n325\n00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.480\nWhen you delete a file on a hard drive,\nthe data does not actually go anywhere.\n\n326\n00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.900\nIt just gets marked as deleted,\nwhich hides it from the operating system,\n\n327\n00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.800\nwhich means that you don't see it,\nbut the data are still there.\n\n328\n00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.170\nAnd it's pretty easy to recover that and\ngets access to it.\n\n329\n00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.893\nSo if I format the disk and then give it\nto Ronnie, Ronnie can spend 10 minutes on\n\n330\n00:15:43.893 --> 00:15:47.158\nGoogle, find some software,\nrun it across the disk and\n\n331\n00:15:47.158 --> 00:15:51.059\nrecover my data, it's not safe to\njust release the data that way.\n\n332\n00:15:51.059 --> 00:15:54.430\nSo if the disk was encrypted,\nI wouldn't have to worry about it, right?\n\n333\n00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.156\nBecause he's gonna go recover information,\nand what's he going to get?\n\n334\n00:15:57.156 --> 00:16:00.644\nEncrypted ciphertext is junk,\nuseless to him right?\n\n335\n00:16:00.644 --> 00:16:03.600\nSo an encrypted disk protects us.\n\n336\n00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.150\nBut if it's not an encrypted disk, and\nyou want to give it to somebody else.\n\n337\n00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.490\nThere is something you can\ndo called a secure erase.\n\n338\n00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.300\nA secure erase is where\nyou erase the drive, but\n\n339\n00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.330\nyou don't just mark the files as deleted.\n\n340\n00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.070\nInstead you go through,\nand you write zeros and\n\n341\n00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:26.480\nones to every single sector\nacross the entire disk.\n\n342\n00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.490\nAnd by doing that, if somebody were to go\nand try and recover deleted information,\n\n343\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.570\nthey would just find these zeros and\nones that you wrote.\n\n344\n00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:36.630\nRight, so that would be pulling that\ninformation back, and it's useless.\n\n345\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.380\nIt's just the ones and zeros that\nyou wrote here as fake data, right?\n\n346\n00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.780\nThat's a great way to defeat\nforensic software, or\n\n347\n00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:48.070\nto just defeat prying eyes,\nsomebody digging for that information.\n\n348\n00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.790\nIf the drive was encrypted,\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n349\n00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.330\nRight, that's kind of a key thing here,\nencryption is the best solution for this.\n\n350\n00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.250\nEncryption has a little bit\nof administrative overhead.\n\n351\n00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.170\nYou have to have recovery keys, you gotta\nstore them somewhere safe, and all that.\n\n352\n00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:03.550\nSo on an unencrypted disk like mine, I\njust need to securely erase it, all right.\n\n353\n00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.350\nWell, in the last episode, I showed\nyou guys how to format hard drives.\n\n354\n00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:08.520\nAnd we could drop a file\nsystem on them and all that.\n\n355\n00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.380\nAnd we did that through the Disk Utility.\n\n356\n00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.615\nSo if I fire up my Disk Utility.\n\n357\n00:17:13.321 --> 00:17:18.370\nI could take a disk, like my little\nWestern Digital Elements disk here.\n\n358\n00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:23.480\nAnd I could choose to erase it, and pick\na name and file system, and hit Erase.\n\n359\n00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.430\nNow when I do that, here, I'll do it.\n\n360\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.860\nHere it's gonna erase it.\n\n361\n00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:33.290\nAnd shoot, it was in use,\nlet me try that again, and there we go.\n\n362\n00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.760\nSo it's gonna erase and it's done, right?\n\n363\n00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.540\nWell, almost done, any minute now.\n\n364\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:43.058\nWe'll be patient,\nI'm trying to be patient, and done, there.\n\n365\n00:17:43.058 --> 00:17:45.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that was what, 20 seconds maybe?\n\n366\n00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.980\n20 very uncomfortable and awkward seconds.\n\n367\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.310\nBut there it is and it's done.\n\n368\n00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.720\nAnd now the drive is empty, right?\n\n369\n00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.070\nIt's called Untitled,\nif I browse into it over here, it's empty.\n\n370\n00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.940\nBut 20 seconds, you can't even\nread all of a disk in 20 seconds,\n\n371\n00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.060\nbetter yet, write to it.\n\n372\n00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.610\nIt didn't actually touch the whole disk.\n\n373\n00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.950\nAll it did was go to the boot record,\nthe master boot record.\n\n374\n00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.900\nOr the GPT, if you have\nthe GUID Partition Table turned on.\n\n375\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.300\nAnd it just erased that table.\n\n376\n00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.920\nAnd then it put a new\none in that was empty.\n\n377\n00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.120\nBut all the file data is actually still\nthere, it's still there on the disk,\n\n378\n00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.360\nit's just hidden, right?\n\n379\n00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.060\nAnd it can be recovered.\n\n380\n00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.136\nSo if you want to securely\nerase a disk like this?\n\n381\n00:18:25.136 --> 00:18:30.019\nWhat you can do is you can choose the\nvolume of the disk that you want to erase.\n\n382\n00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:32.786\nAnd when you hit that Erase button,\ninstead of doing what I did and\n\n383\n00:18:32.786 --> 00:18:34.257\njust really quick hitting Erase.\n\n384\n00:18:34.257 --> 00:18:37.520\nYou will notice there's this\nSecurity Options button.\n\n385\n00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.620\nAnd if you go into Security Options,\n\n386\n00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.620\nyou'll see an interesting choice here,\nright.\n\n387\n00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.860\nIt says, these options specify\nhow to erase the selected disk or\n\n388\n00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.230\nvolume to prevent disk recovery\napplications from recovering.\n\n389\n00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.480\nThat's exactly what I'm talking about.\n\n390\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.515\nTo prevent forensic software\nfrom digging in and\n\n391\n00:18:52.515 --> 00:18:54.720\npulling deleted information off of it.\n\n392\n00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.720\nAnd then it says here that I've\ngot choices, got four choices.\n\n393\n00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.880\nThe default is fastest, and this is\nwhat I just did, right, the fastest.\n\n394\n00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.525\nSo as this option does not\nsecurely erase files on the disk,\n\n395\n00:19:05.525 --> 00:19:08.890\na disk recovery application may\nbe able to recover the files.\n\n396\n00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.610\nIt didn't actually mess with the data.\n\n397\n00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.120\nIt just removed the table, and that's it.\n\n398\n00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.740\nSo it's like that Poltergeist movie,\nright?\n\n399\n00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.259\nThey removed the head from someone,\nbut they didn't remove the bodies?\n\n400\n00:19:18.259 --> 00:19:20.637\nThat's exactly what's going on here,\nthey remove the head so,\n\n401\n00:19:20.637 --> 00:19:21.860\nthis is my morbid example today.\n\n402\n00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.368\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n403\n00:19:22.368 --> 00:19:23.292\n&gt;&gt; But [LAUGH] that's\n\n404\n00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:25.502\nwhat's going on here.\nThose bodies are still\n\n405\n00:19:25.502 --> 00:19:27.932\nburied in this hard drive.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n406\n00:19:27.932 --> 00:19:29.102\n&gt;&gt; This is going nowhere fast.\n\n407\n00:19:29.102 --> 00:19:30.880\nSo if we move to the next option though,\n\n408\n00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.600\nif we just move over one more here, right.\n\n409\n00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.740\nNow it says,\nthis option writes a pass of random data.\n\n410\n00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.790\nSo it's just random ones and\nzeros across the entire disk.\n\n411\n00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.500\nThen, it does another pass of just zeros,\nand\n\n412\n00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.660\nit writes a zero to every single\nsector across the entire disk.\n\n413\n00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.160\nIt erases the information used\nto access your files, and\n\n414\n00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.810\nwrites over the data two times, right?\n\n415\n00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.990\nRandom ones and\nzeros followed by all zeros.\n\n416\n00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.290\nSome people call this zeroing out\nthe disk, right, zeroing out every sector.\n\n417\n00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.500\nNow, why do it twice?\n\n418\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.613\nWell the reason it does it twice,\nis that for a normal person, right.\n\n419\n00:20:08.613 --> 00:20:10.435\nIf it were Ronnie, for me, whatever.\n\n420\n00:20:10.435 --> 00:20:13.830\nRemember where I said you could spend\nten minutes Googling and find software?\n\n421\n00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:19.500\nThat type of software will usually\nhandle one pass, right, but two passes?\n\n422\n00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.830\nNo way, that software doesn't work.\n\n423\n00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:29.160\nBut, The FBI, the CIA, the NSA, all those\nthree-letter agencies, all those guys.\n\n424\n00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.150\nThey have software that's\neven more advanced.\n\n425\n00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.960\nThey can see, two, three,\neven four passes beyond, right?\n\n426\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.150\nThey can really see when data has been\noverwritten and recover that information.\n\n427\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.080\nNow, it takes a lot of effort,\nand a lot of money, and\n\n428\n00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.800\na lot of necessity to go in and do that.\n\n429\n00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.990\nSo most of us don't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n430\n00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:50.020\nIf you're just giving your hard drive to\na friend, or a family member, whatever.\n\n431\n00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.490\nThen this option here,\nwith the two passes, that's enough.\n\n432\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.400\nThat's gonna work fine,\n\n433\n00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.580\nyou know the disk is clean, you can now\nsafely give it over to somebody else.\n\n434\n00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.890\nBut if you had sensitive data,\nmaybe you work at a hospital, and\n\n435\n00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.630\nyou had patient records on there.\n\n436\n00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.580\nOr you work for a bank, and\nyou have financial information on there.\n\n437\n00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.380\nYou don't want to trust two passes,\nyou want to go more.\n\n438\n00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.550\nBecause a hacker that's\nspecifically targeting you,\n\n439\n00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.350\nwould be motivated to try and defeat that.\n\n440\n00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.850\nSo they would try\nsomething a little harder.\n\n441\n00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.090\nSo if you move to the next step,\nwe can see the next level is, says,\n\n442\n00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:26.990\nthis option is DOE-compliant\n3-pass secure erase.\n\n443\n00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.370\nIt writes two passes of random data,\n\n444\n00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:33.660\nfollowed by a single pass of\nknown data over the entire disk.\n\n445\n00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.721\nIt erases the information\nused to access your filers,\n\n446\n00:21:35.721 --> 00:21:37.290\nwrites over the data three times.\n\n447\n00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.330\nSo this is an extra level,\n\n448\n00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:43.990\nan extra step here to make sure our\ninformation is that much safer.\n\n449\n00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.116\nAnd this is DOE-compliant, so it's usually\ngood enough for the US government.\n\n450\n00:21:47.116 --> 00:21:51.200\nBut if you want, now it's like Spinal Tap,\nright, we go to 11.\n\n451\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.280\nWe can crank it up one more\nstep to the highest one.\n\n452\n00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.520\nAnd this is Department of Defense,\nDOD, right?\n\n453\n00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.690\nSo US Department of Defense\n5220-22 M standard for\n\n454\n00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.275\nsecurely erasing magnetic media.\n\n455\n00:22:04.275 --> 00:22:07.200\nIt erases the information\nused to access your files and\n\n456\n00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.993\nwrites over the data 7 times.\n\n457\n00:22:09.993 --> 00:22:13.610\n7 times, that's a lot, right.\n\n458\n00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.990\nAnd this is about as\ngood as you're gonna get.\n\n459\n00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.970\nIt's gonna erase that data,\nand overwrite it seven times.\n\n460\n00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:22.505\nNow, the one thing I haven't really\nmentioned is how long this takes.\n\n461\n00:22:22.505 --> 00:22:25.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When I erased a disc a minute ago,\n\n462\n00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.980\nit was 20 seconds, and honestly,\n\n463\n00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.210\nI got kinda bored-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n464\n00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.070\n&gt;&gt; In 20 seconds.\n\n465\n00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.403\n&gt;&gt; If you choose even\nthe second option there, right?\n\n466\n00:22:34.403 --> 00:22:38.057\nWhere it just overrides everything twice,\nthat was here, this one.\n\n467\n00:22:38.057 --> 00:22:44.150\nThat process will usually\ntake a couple hours, right.\n\n468\n00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.610\nWhen you start moving up to three times,\nit can take an entire day.\n\n469\n00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:51.960\nAnd when you go up to most secure,\nit can take days, in some cases,\n\n470\n00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.000\nto properly erase this disk.\n\n471\n00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.140\nSo if you're just worried about protecting\nyour data before you throw this drive\n\n472\n00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:58.920\nin the trash.\n\n473\n00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.160\nIt's usually faster to\njust destroy the drive.\n\n474\n00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.730\nThey actually have machine shredders\nthat can crush and shred the drive.\n\n475\n00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.260\nThat's faster, it's over instantly,\nand it looks really cool.\n\n476\n00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.440\nBut if you're trying to repurpose this, if\nyou wanna give it to someone else to use,\n\n477\n00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.690\nyou don't wanna destroy it?\n\n478\n00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.370\nThen you can choose these higher levels.\n\n479\n00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.650\nThis is super paranoia level,\nblack helicopters and all that stuff,\n\n480\n00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.250\nto need to go all the way\nup to seven times.\n\n481\n00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.500\nBut you know it's effective.\n\n482\n00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:28.030\nIt certainly will work,\nit's just gonna take a long, long time.\n\n483\n00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.390\nAnother things worth mentioning here,\nis see how is says, for\n\n484\n00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:34.070\nsecurely erasing magnetic media?\n\n485\n00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:37.820\nSpinning disks, spinning disks are the\nones that suffer from being able to\n\n486\n00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.590\nrecover this magnetic imprints\nthat are created on the disk.\n\n487\n00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:45.262\nWhen you use SSD and Flash,\nthat's a different story, right?\n\n488\n00:23:45.262 --> 00:23:49.554\nSSD, you got an electrical charge\nthat is being dropped into a cell,\n\n489\n00:23:49.554 --> 00:23:52.152\nand it has to basically retain that data.\n\n490\n00:23:52.152 --> 00:23:55.868\nIt's not magnetic in the sense\nwe normally have it.\n\n491\n00:23:55.868 --> 00:23:57.775\nIs written as a poll or\nsomething like that.\n\n492\n00:23:57.775 --> 00:23:58.575\nI forget exactly how it works.\n\n493\n00:23:58.575 --> 00:23:59.273\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n494\n00:23:59.273 --> 00:24:03.060\n&gt;&gt; But it's different, and so\ndata recovery on those is a lot different.\n\n495\n00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.390\nSo we don't have to worry about this so\nmuch on the modern SSD's.\n\n496\n00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.440\nBut either way I'll tell you guys, for\nme I just make sure the drive's encrypted.\n\n497\n00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.310\nIf the drive is encrypted I don't\ncare if people recover the bits that\n\n498\n00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.330\nare left on there.\n\n499\n00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:18.200\nBecause the bits are useless without\nmy private key which they are not going\n\n500\n00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.180\nto have, all right.\n\n501\n00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.830\nSo I were choose one of the lower levels\nhere, so we will choose two times, right?\n\n502\n00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:28.900\nAnd if I say OK to that it's gonna go\nin here and start to do the arrays.\n\n503\n00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.099\nAnd a moment ago that erase\ntook about 20 seconds but\n\n504\n00:24:32.099 --> 00:24:35.595\nnow it's starting a secure erase and\nthis is a two-pass.\n\n505\n00:24:35.595 --> 00:24:38.641\nSo the first pass is gonna\nwrite random ones and zeroes.\n\n506\n00:24:38.641 --> 00:24:41.285\nAnd the second pass is going\nto write all zeros, but\n\n507\n00:24:41.285 --> 00:24:44.740\nI'll be honest with you the process\ntakes the same amount of time.\n\n508\n00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.690\nWhether it's random data or zeros cuz it's\nsuppose to go through and write everyone.\n\n509\n00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:52.310\nAnd eventually it will\ngive me an estimated time.\n\n510\n00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:56.370\nIt's kicking off that process but I'll bet\nyou this one even just the two pass is\n\n511\n00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.890\nprobably going to take at least an hour.\n\n512\n00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.720\nOf it just kind of running along and\ntaking its time.\n\n513\n00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.420\nSo you do get a secure ace,\nbut it just takes longer.\n\n514\n00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:11.130\nNow some of you might remember\nanother thing that Apple used to have.\n\n515\n00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.980\nIf you threw things in your recycle\nbin there was actually a secure\n\n516\n00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.060\nempty trash option, right?\n\n517\n00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.030\nSo I feel stuck in the trash I can\nempty the trash and it's deleted.\n\n518\n00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.500\nBut technically the bits are left behind\non the drive just like anything else.\n\n519\n00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.720\nSo you used to be able to go into your\nfinder and go under file menu and\n\n520\n00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.910\nyou'd see secure empty trash and\nyou could do that.\n\n521\n00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:33.350\nThat actually got removed after,\nI believe Mavricks, so I'll kept it on,\n\n522\n00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:37.730\ndidn't have it and\nnow Sierra doesn't have it.\n\n523\n00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.970\nSo you might ask yourself why\ndid they get rid of that?\n\n524\n00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:43.584\nAnd it goes back to the same thing is if\nyour drive is encrypted you don't need\n\n525\n00:25:43.584 --> 00:25:44.327\nthat feature.\n\n526\n00:25:44.327 --> 00:25:48.200\nAnd the feature wasn't really used by many\npeople anyway cuz you forget about it.\n\n527\n00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.820\nIt's kind of tucked away under a menu.\n\n528\n00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.165\nSo the better option now is disencryption.\n\n529\n00:25:52.165 --> 00:25:53.810\nApple's really pushing file vault.\n\n530\n00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.980\nThere is no reason for\nyou not to use File Vault these days\n\n531\n00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.380\nabsolutely on a mobile device like\na laptop you definitely want it.\n\n532\n00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.470\nBut even on your desktop it's a good\nidea to have File Vault enabled.\n\n533\n00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.710\nIt's super easy to turn on and\nthen you'll be protected.\n\n534\n00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.590\nIn the background my Virtual Machine\nthat I was encrypting it's already done.\n\n535\n00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.400\nIt's encrypted, now any data that I store\non this system is going to be protected,\n\n536\n00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.750\nand I don't have to\nworry about it anymore.\n\n537\n00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:20.350\nI can put this out of my mind and\nuse the computer as a computer.\n\n538\n00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.880\nNot be constantly worried about\nwhether my data is secure.\n\n539\n00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.680\nAll right, so that's a pretty good spot\nfor us to wrap this one up Ronnie.\n\n540\n00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.350\nI think we've talked enough about storage.\n\n541\n00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.520\nWe just still have file permissions to\ntalk about, we'll get to those later on.\n\n542\n00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.650\nBut as far as securing the disks\nthemselves those are kind of\n\n543\n00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:36.580\nthe key components that we have.\n\n544\n00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:37.338\n&gt;&gt; All right Don,\n\n545\n00:26:37.338 --> 00:26:40.848\nwell thank you again to help us\nunderstand that we're on File Vault 1.\n\n546\n00:26:40.848 --> 00:26:45.111\nAnd we really need to think about moving\nof course to the modern File Vault And\n\n547\n00:26:45.111 --> 00:26:48.573\nDon did just us how we need to take\nthat process in mind to remove\n\n548\n00:26:48.573 --> 00:26:52.523\nof course File Vault 1 before we\nstart encrypting with File Vault 2.\n\n549\n00:26:52.523 --> 00:26:56.160\nAnd of course also the secondly\nhere we talked about destroying\n\n550\n00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.806\nthe data that may exist and\nwant to repurpose that disk as well.\n\n551\n00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:02.427\nAnd we'll saw some of those\noptions that are available for\n\n552\n00:27:02.427 --> 00:27:04.520\nus to\n&gt;&gt; And remember Don's heed,\n\n553\n00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.250\nor his admonition to us.\n\n554\n00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.340\nThere is really no reason for\nus not to be using this\n\n555\n00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:14.210\nif we do have any type of sensitive\ndata on our computer's it's worth it.\n\n556\n00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.980\nAnd so take the time, learn how to\nactually get it working for us.\n\n557\n00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.500\nBut that's a great place for\nus to also sign off.\n\n558\n00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.150\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n559\n00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:24.250\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n560\n00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:28.501\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n561\n00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:34.310\n[MUSIC]\n\n562\n00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:37.609\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

00:00:08.136\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:08.136 --> 00:00:11.792\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:15.239\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:20.270\n&gt;&gt; You're watching the Apple certified\nsupport professional for Mac OS Sierra.\n\n7\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.875\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today,\nwe're taking up file permissions.\n\n8\n00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:27.240\nAnd here to help us to understand\nthat topic better is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.540\nDon, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.830\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.630\nReady to dive into permissions.\n\n12\n00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.640\nAnd if you've been watching\nthese shows in order,\n\n13\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.420\nthen you know the last couple\nepisodes we covered file systems.\n\n14\n00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.283\nAnd we took a hard drive,\nwe partitioned it, we formatted it, and\n\n15\n00:00:39.283 --> 00:00:41.034\nnow it's ready to stick files on there.\n\n16\n00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:45.368\n[LAUGH] And at the time, we talked\na little bit about permissions, and\n\n17\n00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:48.220\nsecuring our data, and protecting access.\n\n18\n00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.990\nAnd we talked about disk encryption,\nand all these great things.\n\n19\n00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.530\nBut there's one area that we\nreally haven't addressed, and\n\n20\n00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.850\nI wanna spend the next couple\nof episodes talking about it.\n\n21\n00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.140\nAnd that's file permissions, that\nwhenever you put a file on a file system,\n\n22\n00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.200\nthere are certain permissions\nthat are associated with it.\n\n23\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.390\nAnd those permissions dictate\nwho's allowed to access what.\n\n24\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.330\nNow if you are the only person\nthat uses the computer,\n\n25\n00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.570\nit's just you, you don't share it with\nanybody, it's just your own little world,\n\n26\n00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.960\nyou probably don't care much\nabout permissions like these.\n\n27\n00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.990\nBut in a shared environment,\nwhere you either have more than one person\n\n28\n00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.070\nusing the same computer or people coming\nover the network and accessing files on\n\n29\n00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.692\nyour system, in those cases, you really\ndo care about those file permissions.\n\n30\n00:01:29.692 --> 00:01:33.260\nYou wanna make sure you dictate that\ncertain people are allowed to perform\n\n31\n00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.670\ncertain actions and other people aren't.\n\n32\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.940\nYou wanna maintain control of that data.\n\n33\n00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.710\nAnd file permissions are how we do it.\n\n34\n00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.980\nFortunately, they're really easy to set.\n\n35\n00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.114\nAnd, well, wait,\nlet me clarify that a little bit.\n\n36\n00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:46.495\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They can be really easy to set.\n\n37\n00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:48.620\n[LAUGH] And so in this episode,\n\n38\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.060\nwe're basically doing part\none of file permissions here.\n\n39\n00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.770\nAnd in this episode,\nwe're gonna keep it easy.\n\n40\n00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.880\nWe're gonna use the GUI.\n\n41\n00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.330\nWe're gonna go through the standard\nfile permissions that a normal\n\n42\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.450\nuser is going to experience.\n\n43\n00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.670\nBut as a support professional, we don't\nnormally get to deal with the normal easy,\n\n44\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.180\nwhat a user experiences thing.\n\n45\n00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.400\nWe deal with the problems.\n\n46\n00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.333\nAnd so in the next part, we're gonna\ngo behind the scenes, and go into\n\n47\n00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:12.819\nthe underlying Unix operating system to\nshow how the permissions really work, and\n\n48\n00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.350\nget kind of a view on that.\n\n49\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.470\nBut for right now, let's just focus\non the permissions themselves and\n\n50\n00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.180\nmake sure we've got a good grasp of that,\nand see what the users see.\n\n51\n00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.840\nAll right, so\nwhere we're gonna be kicking things off is\n\n52\n00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.140\njust kind of a basic look\nat what we've already got.\n\n53\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.980\nAnd I wanna go with the defaults on this.\n\n54\n00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.910\nSo I'm not gonna go into\nanything too crazy and\n\n55\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.830\nspecial right here at the beginning.\n\n56\n00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.200\nWhen you create a user account and\n\n57\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.630\nyou log into a computer,\na home folder is created for you, right?\n\n58\n00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.450\nWe've seen that in an earlier episode,\ntoo.\n\n59\n00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.400\nEverybody's got their own home folder.\n\n60\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.650\nAnd their home folder has files and\n\n61\n00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.790\nfolders in it, and each of them have\na default set of permissions that\n\n62\n00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.910\nare applied that restrict access to each\nof the different things inside of it.\n\n63\n00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.030\nAnd I think we've actually bumped into\nthat in a few episodes earlier where I\n\n64\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.190\nmight have been blocked on a folder or\na file.\n\n65\n00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.900\nWell, how did that happen?\n\n66\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.190\nIt happened because of permissions.\n\n67\n00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.260\nSo let me show you an example here.\n\n68\n00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.310\nSo I'm sitting here on my desktop, and\nI've got a folder sitting out here.\n\n69\n00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.570\nWell, it's kinda down here\nunder my head or whatever,\n\n70\n00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.060\nbut this folder called Podcast.\n\n71\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.590\nAnd I've got a couple of podcast files\ninside of it that are just sitting here.\n\n72\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.950\nAnd I didn't worry about permissions.\n\n73\n00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.300\nI just created a folder,\nstuck it on my desktop, and\n\n74\n00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.370\nthen I chucked a few files in it,\nright, so nothing too crazy there.\n\n75\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.670\nWell, that folder and these files all\nhave permissions assigned to them.\n\n76\n00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.770\nIf you take a file or a folder,\nfor that matter, or whatever.\n\n77\n00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.460\nIf you take it and you Ctrl-click on it,\nyou can go to Get info.\n\n78\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.949\nOr I usually do Cmd+I, right?\n\n79\n00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.580\nCmd+I does the same thing, does Get info.\n\n80\n00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.580\nAnd in the Get info screen,\nyou'll see information about that folder.\n\n81\n00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.790\nI can see I've got nine gigs\nof data in this folder.\n\n82\n00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.160\nI can see when I wrote the information to\nit, whether it's a shared folder or not,\n\n83\n00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.840\nI'm sharing this one on the network.\n\n84\n00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.060\nSo people on the network\nare able to access this folder.\n\n85\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.680\nBut as I scroll down, eventually you'll\nget to this, Sharing &amp; Permissions.\n\n86\n00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.370\nAnd on the Sharing &amp; Permissions side,\n\n87\n00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.450\nit shows who's allowed to do\nwhat with this folder, right?\n\n88\n00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.536\nAnd normally what you're going\nto see are three basic entries,\n\n89\n00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:20.056\nthese guys right here.\n\n90\n00:04:20.056 --> 00:04:24.840\nMe, staff, and everyone, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.800\nSo what are these?\n\n92\n00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.255\nThese three permissions represent\nthe basic Unix permissions under the hood.\n\n93\n00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:37.243\nAnd in Unix land, we call these UGO,\nthe user, the group, and\n\n94\n00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:40.610\nthe other, user, group, other.\n\n95\n00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.340\nThe user is the owner, the person\nwho actually created this content.\n\n96\n00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.595\nI'm the one who created this folder,\nso that's dpezet, me.\n\n97\n00:04:48.595 --> 00:04:52.175\nI'm the one who made it so\nI'm the user that controls this.\n\n98\n00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:58.225\nThen the group is a default group\ncreated in Mac OS that's called staff.\n\n99\n00:04:58.225 --> 00:05:02.545\nNow staff is a weird group because if\nyou go into your system preferences, and\n\n100\n00:05:02.545 --> 00:05:06.460\ngo into users and groups,\nand you expand out groups.\n\n101\n00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.910\nI don't see any staff, right.\n\n102\n00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.340\nIt's a hidden group.\n\n103\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.860\nThe staff group contains\nevery user on your system.\n\n104\n00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.790\nSo right now, the staff group contains me.\n\n105\n00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.530\nIf I create a group for Ronnie, right,\nso let me create an account for\n\n106\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.180\nhim real quick.\n\n107\n00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.680\nCuz Ronnie doesn't have\nan account on my laptop.\n\n108\n00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.370\nSo I'm gonna create an account for Ronnie.\n\n109\n00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.842\nAnd I'll just make him a standard user,\nright?\n\n110\n00:05:29.842 --> 00:05:31.562\nSo it' s gonna be Ronnie Wong.\n\n111\n00:05:31.562 --> 00:05:34.680\nWe'll make you RWong and\nI'll give you a password.\n\n112\n00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:42.270\nAnd when I get him created, all right,\nnow here he is, he's a standard user.\n\n113\n00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.790\nI didn't see it happen but\n\n114\n00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.850\nin the background he was\nadded to the staff group.\n\n115\n00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.280\nSo every user account that I create\nhere is a part of the staff group,\n\n116\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.000\nexcept for this guy right here,\nthe Guest User.\n\n117\n00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.580\nThe Guest User is off on my laptop,\nis not a part of the staff group.\n\n118\n00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.750\nSo it’s gotta be an actual user account\nthat has a name and password and so on.\n\n119\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.710\nSo that's what staff is.\n\n120\n00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.740\nAnd so what this is really saying is\nwhen I look at these permissions,\n\n121\n00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.980\nit's saying me, I'm the owner, and\nI have a certain level of access.\n\n122\n00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:22.430\nEverybody else who has an account on my\nlaptop has this other level of access.\n\n123\n00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.960\nAnd then there's what in\nUnix is called other, but\n\n124\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.440\nhere we see it's called everyone.\n\n125\n00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.940\nThis is literally everyone,\nincluding the guest account,\n\n126\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.970\nincluding the network\nusers that are coming in.\n\n127\n00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.344\nEverybody has this other level of access.\n\n128\n00:06:39.344 --> 00:06:42.960\nAnd you'll see in my scenario here,\nI've got read and write.\n\n129\n00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.330\nI can write data into this Podcast folder.\n\n130\n00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.250\nAnd then staff has read only.\n\n131\n00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.790\nSo anybody else who has an account on my\nlaptop is able to browse into that folder\n\n132\n00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.690\nand read those podcast files.\n\n133\n00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.760\nThey can play the videos or whatever,\nbut they can't delete them.\n\n134\n00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.360\nThey can't change them.\n\n135\n00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.810\nThey can't even add more\nstuff to the folder,\n\n136\n00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.290\nbecause these are folder permissions,\nright?\n\n137\n00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.240\nSo on the folder they've got read only,\nthey can't create their own files.\n\n138\n00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.470\nAnd then if they're not in staff,\nif they're the guest user or\n\n139\n00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.520\nany remote user, they're under\neveryone and they have no access.\n\n140\n00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.710\nThey're not able to access this\nfolder at all, it's private.\n\n141\n00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.770\nAnd because I created this folder and\n\n142\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.120\nI control it I can change\nthese permissions if I want.\n\n143\n00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.910\nSo maybe I don't want everyone, or\nmaybe I do want everyone to have access.\n\n144\n00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.100\nI want everybody to come in and\nplay these podcasts, right?\n\n145\n00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.780\nThey're gonna go on YouTube anyway.\n\n146\n00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.330\nSo I might come in here and\nset that to read only also.\n\n147\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.760\nAnd now everyone can read those\npodcast files and play them, and\n\n148\n00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.800\noff they go, right?\n\n149\n00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.740\nSo these are the ways that we\nkind of manage those permissions.\n\n150\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.104\nNow I mentioned that by default you're\ngonna see three permissions, right,\n\n151\n00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:53.746\nthe user, the group and the other, right,\nor the owner, the group and everyone.\n\n152\n00:07:53.746 --> 00:07:55.793\nBut on mine,\nsee how there's actually five, and\n\n153\n00:07:55.793 --> 00:07:57.518\ntwo of them are kind of messed up, right.\n\n154\n00:07:57.518 --> 00:08:02.556\nIt says fetching, and it's been fetching\nfor however long I've been talking.\n\n155\n00:08:02.556 --> 00:08:06.980\nWell what's going on is I have some other\naccounts that are tied to a network\n\n156\n00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.550\nserver.\n\n157\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.970\nThis is my actual laptop,\nnot a lab machine.\n\n158\n00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.460\nAnd so it's tied to another server.\n\n159\n00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.620\nAnd, in this case,\nit knows the account exists.\n\n160\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.081\nAnd it knows the credential's there,\nit knows to check these permissions.\n\n161\n00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:21.902\nBut it's reaching out to that server\nto figure out what the name is that's\n\n162\n00:08:21.902 --> 00:08:23.300\nattached to that account.\n\n163\n00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.966\nAnd I've powered off that server,\nbecause that server is a lab machine.\n\n164\n00:08:25.966 --> 00:08:28.685\nAnd so it's not able to retrieve those\nnames, so that's what these are.\n\n165\n00:08:28.685 --> 00:08:32.815\nBut the key thing that I wanna point\nout here is that we can change these.\n\n166\n00:08:32.815 --> 00:08:35.679\nWe can modify these permissions and\ncome in and\n\n167\n00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.040\nchange them to suit our needs, okay?\n\n168\n00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.264\nNow what I'm looking at right now\nare permissions that are on this folder,\n\n169\n00:08:41.264 --> 00:08:42.761\nkind of the way that they're set.\n\n170\n00:08:42.761 --> 00:08:47.380\nBut I can use the + and- buttons\nhere to modify these permissions.\n\n171\n00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.472\nI can add more people to it,\nI can take away.\n\n172\n00:08:50.472 --> 00:08:53.745\nI can do whatever it is that\nI need to customize them.\n\n173\n00:08:53.745 --> 00:08:59.255\nBut at a minimum you're gong to see\nthese three entries here, okay?\n\n174\n00:08:59.255 --> 00:09:02.302\nIn fact if I were to switch over\nto Ronnie's account, for example,\n\n175\n00:09:02.302 --> 00:09:03.485\nthat I just made, right?\n\n176\n00:09:03.485 --> 00:09:05.539\nSo Ronnie's a brand new user.\n\n177\n00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:10.479\nAnd when I log into his, assuming that\nI haven't messed up anything too crazy\n\n178\n00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:13.835\non my laptop,\nhe should see just the default three.\n\n179\n00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:16.830\nNow this is the first time he's logged in,\nso it's gonna take a moment.\n\n180\n00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.102\nWhy does it take a moment?\n\n181\n00:09:18.102 --> 00:09:20.020\nWell it's creating his home folder.\n\n182\n00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.624\nIt's creating his documents,\nand downloads, and library.\n\n183\n00:09:23.624 --> 00:09:27.030\nAnd all the other little folders\nthat go along with his account.\n\n184\n00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.850\nAnd it's putting a default\nset of permissions on them.\n\n185\n00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.012\nAnd that default set of\npermissions is important,\n\n186\n00:09:33.012 --> 00:09:35.233\nbecause it serves as the baseline,\nwhere we start.\n\n187\n00:09:35.233 --> 00:09:38.920\nAnd then we go and modify those\npermissions to meet our needs.\n\n188\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.853\nAnd get everything kind of\nput the way that we want it.\n\n189\n00:09:42.489 --> 00:09:47.706\nAll right now when we set up this\npermissions, it is important to understand\n\n190\n00:09:47.706 --> 00:09:52.448\nthat there is what's called\npermissions inheritance, all right?\n\n191\n00:09:52.448 --> 00:09:55.972\nAnd so when I create a folder here,\nI'm just gonna create a folder.\n\n192\n00:09:55.972 --> 00:09:57.820\nThis will be Ronnie's data folder, right?\n\n193\n00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.410\nSo this is gonna be where\nhe stores his information.\n\n194\n00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:04.590\nAnd I'll do a Cmd+I on it to\npull up the information on it.\n\n195\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.820\nAnd I'll expand out the sharing and\npermissions.\n\n196\n00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:13.410\nAnd if you look at his, you can actually\nsee that it's got just the three values.\n\n197\n00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.541\nHis isn't fetching.\n\n198\n00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:18.790\nAnd, you're a new account,\nRonnie, so I can't zoom with you.\n\n199\n00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:22.774\nLet me turn on the zoom function real\nquick so I can make this show up nice and\n\n200\n00:10:22.774 --> 00:10:23.817\nbig on the screen.\n\n201\n00:10:23.817 --> 00:10:24.832\nThere we go, all right.\n\n202\n00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:25.754\nSo he just has the three.\n\n203\n00:10:25.754 --> 00:10:28.520\nHe doesn't have that fetching, right,\nbecause I've messed with my account.\n\n204\n00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.395\nBut he's got rwong is listed as Me.\n\n205\n00:10:31.395 --> 00:10:33.460\nHe's the owner of this folder.\n\n206\n00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.610\nAnd staff has read only,\nand everyone has read only.\n\n207\n00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.380\nThose are the default\npermissions that are created.\n\n208\n00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.550\nNow inside of that folder\nhe may have files.\n\n209\n00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:49.670\nAnd each file is going inherit\nthe permissions from the parent, right?\n\n210\n00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.100\nSo if he starts creating files in here,\nor even other folders, right?\n\n211\n00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.889\nSo we might have like Public and\nPrivate, right, so this is his data.\n\n212\n00:10:58.889 --> 00:11:02.332\nAnd he might have some public data\nthat he wants to share with people.\n\n213\n00:11:02.332 --> 00:11:06.175\nAnd then he might have some private data\nthat he doesn't wanna share with people.\n\n214\n00:11:06.175 --> 00:11:08.949\nHe wants it all to be in the data folder\ncuz that's where he goes to save things.\n\n215\n00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:10.785\nIt's easy, he remembers it, right?\n\n216\n00:11:10.785 --> 00:11:13.635\nBut then he wants to isolate\nthings out by permissions.\n\n217\n00:11:13.635 --> 00:11:17.425\nWell, when you create these folders,\nthey get their permissions,\n\n218\n00:11:17.425 --> 00:11:20.580\nthey inherit their permissions\nfrom the parent folder.\n\n219\n00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.091\nSo if we take like this Public folder for\nexample, and\n\n220\n00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:26.597\npull up its information, and I look.\n\n221\n00:11:26.597 --> 00:11:29.796\nI should see the exact same\npermissions as the parent folder.\n\n222\n00:11:29.796 --> 00:11:33.646\nIt's inheriting those permissions,\nall right?\n\n223\n00:11:33.646 --> 00:11:36.320\nNow if I go back up to the parent.\n\n224\n00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.618\nSo here's the parent folder, Data.\n\n225\n00:11:38.618 --> 00:11:41.530\nAnd I'm gonna go and\nmodify these permissions.\n\n226\n00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.863\nI'm gonna say I don't want\neveryone to have access.\n\n227\n00:11:44.863 --> 00:11:46.363\nI'll make that No Access.\n\n228\n00:11:46.363 --> 00:11:50.090\nAnd then maybe we wanna add\nsomebody else to it, right?\n\n229\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.625\nSo we're gonna add me,\nRonnie's gonna give me access.\n\n230\n00:11:53.625 --> 00:11:58.761\nAnd when he gives me access, we can\ncome in here and say, make Read &amp; Write.\n\n231\n00:11:58.761 --> 00:12:00.900\nSo now we have four entries in there,\nright?\n\n232\n00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.370\nThe three defaults, these are the ones\nthat we're going to have.\n\n233\n00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.290\nAnd then the one that he just added.\n\n234\n00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.970\nNow both those permissions\nare going to be inherited\n\n235\n00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.440\nby the items inside of that folder, right?\n\n236\n00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.480\nSo if I take Public, and pull up its\ninformation now and take a look at it,\n\n237\n00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.350\nwell, they're not inherited.\n\n238\n00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.950\nWhere are they, right?\n\n239\n00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.353\nThey haven't changed because this folder\nwas created already, it's in place.\n\n240\n00:12:23.353 --> 00:12:27.560\nIt's already got its own set of\npermissions, it's not inheriting them.\n\n241\n00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.332\nSo I need to force those down, and\nthat's actually not that hard to do.\n\n242\n00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:34.440\nWhat I can do is go back\nup to my Data folder.\n\n243\n00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.273\nAnd in my Data folder,\nif I pull its information back up again.\n\n244\n00:12:39.273 --> 00:12:40.950\nAnd go down and look at the permissions.\n\n245\n00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.150\nHere's the permissions that I set, right?\n\n246\n00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:48.050\nAnd under this gear, you'll see\nthe option to Apply to enclosed option.\n\n247\n00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:52.050\nSo I can force the inheritance\ndown onto the items inside of it.\n\n248\n00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.250\nNow it is a locked item,\nyou have to be an administrator to do it.\n\n249\n00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.000\nI'm logged in as Ronnie, and so it's not\nletting me override those permissions.\n\n250\n00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.249\nSo I'll need to hit\nthe little lock icon and\n\n251\n00:13:00.249 --> 00:13:03.136\noverride that real quick\nwith an administer account.\n\n252\n00:13:03.136 --> 00:13:04.098\nI should have made you\nan administrator Ronnie.\n\n253\n00:13:04.098 --> 00:13:06.513\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just don't trust your skills.\n\n254\n00:13:06.513 --> 00:13:07.731\n&gt;&gt; I don't blame you.\n\n255\n00:13:07.731 --> 00:13:08.626\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n256\n00:13:08.626 --> 00:13:09.186\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n257\n00:13:09.186 --> 00:13:11.482\nnow I'm gonna hit that gear and\nhit Apply enclosed items.\n\n258\n00:13:11.482 --> 00:13:14.859\nAnd here its telling me, do I want\nto apply the selected owner, group,\n\n259\n00:13:14.859 --> 00:13:17.050\nand permissions to all enclosed items?\n\n260\n00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.740\nYou can't undo this, cuz basically\nblowing away the other permissions.\n\n261\n00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.628\nSo I'll say OK.\n\n262\n00:13:21.628 --> 00:13:23.720\nAnd there it goes, applying them out.\n\n263\n00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.825\nNow things don't look very\ndifferent here on the screen.\n\n264\n00:13:25.825 --> 00:13:30.202\nBut if I take that Public folder and\npull up its information.\n\n265\n00:13:30.202 --> 00:13:34.421\nAnd look down, I can see that it now\nhas the same permissions as that parent\n\n266\n00:13:34.421 --> 00:13:35.657\nfolder, all right?\n\n267\n00:13:35.657 --> 00:13:37.640\nBut I'm not bound by that.\n\n268\n00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.730\nI can come in and manipulate this\nindividual folder by itself.\n\n269\n00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.450\nSo maybe for example Ronnie wants me\nto have access to the Public folder.\n\n270\n00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.790\nBut he doesn't want me to have\naccess to the Private folder.\n\n271\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.499\nSo he could take that Private folder.\n\n272\n00:13:49.499 --> 00:13:52.331\nGo down here to these permissions\nthat have now been inherited from\n\n273\n00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.480\nthe parent item.\n\n274\n00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:58.080\nAnd they can take me and\nbump me right out, and that's it, okay?\n\n275\n00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.005\nSo you still have control over\neach individual item if you want.\n\n276\n00:14:02.005 --> 00:14:04.310\nBut by applying those permissions\nto the enclosed item,\n\n277\n00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.480\nwe can roll out a set of\npermissions across the board.\n\n278\n00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.956\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, you just did something there\nwhere you removed your own account.\n\n279\n00:14:09.956 --> 00:14:13.907\nIs that gonna be anything different in\nthe result as If I had just put no access\n\n280\n00:14:13.907 --> 00:14:14.914\nbeside your name?\n\n281\n00:14:14.914 --> 00:14:16.960\nOr should that be effectively the same?\n\n282\n00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.631\n&gt;&gt; Well, you'll actually find where\nyou don't have that No Access option\n\n283\n00:14:19.631 --> 00:14:20.419\nall the time.\n\n284\n00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:22.433\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So let's talk about that a little\n\n285\n00:14:22.433 --> 00:14:23.141\nbit, right?\n\n286\n00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:25.549\nSo when I assign permissions,\nright, when we add somebody in.\n\n287\n00:14:25.549 --> 00:14:27.752\nSo let's just add me back in here, right?\n\n288\n00:14:27.752 --> 00:14:28.897\nWe've put me on the list.\n\n289\n00:14:28.897 --> 00:14:33.017\nThere's several different\nprivileges that show up, okay?\n\n290\n00:14:33.017 --> 00:14:36.198\nAnd looking at this list right here,\nwe see the three most common.\n\n291\n00:14:36.198 --> 00:14:41.036\nRead &amp; Write, Read only, and\nNo Access, those are my three, right?\n\n292\n00:14:41.036 --> 00:14:42.195\nSo what do those mean?\n\n293\n00:14:42.195 --> 00:14:45.010\nWell Read &amp; Write,\nit's like the name implies.\n\n294\n00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.540\nI can read, I can open the data\nthat's in there, right?\n\n295\n00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.680\nIf it's a folder, it means I can browse\ninto the folder and list its contents.\n\n296\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.670\nIf it's a file, it means I can open\nthe file and read it's contents.\n\n297\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.350\nI might need a program to do that, right?\n\n298\n00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.420\nLike Microsoft Word, or Pages,\nor something like that.\n\n299\n00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.550\nBut otherwise I can at least open it,\nbut I can't change it.\n\n300\n00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.930\nIf I have Write, I can change it.\n\n301\n00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.780\nI can modify the file, I can create new\nfiles, I can delete old files, right?\n\n302\n00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.949\nSo you can do several things.\n\n303\n00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:18.350\nThe Write term actually encompasses many\ndifferent functions, I can rename files.\n\n304\n00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:22.440\nSo all of that stuff falls under Write,\nit's a really big permission.\n\n305\n00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.600\nAnd then No Access,\nlike it implies, I'm blocked.\n\n306\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.272\nI have no access to the content\ninside of this folder.\n\n307\n00:15:27.272 --> 00:15:30.500\nOr if it's on a file, then I would\nhave no access to that file, right?\n\n308\n00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.274\nI might see the file exists.\n\n309\n00:15:32.274 --> 00:15:36.123\nBut I can't open it, I can't change it,\nI can't really manipulate it at all.\n\n310\n00:15:36.123 --> 00:15:38.302\nNow for the everyone group,\nwhen I drop that down,\n\n311\n00:15:38.302 --> 00:15:39.881\nsee how there's four permissions?\n\n312\n00:15:39.881 --> 00:15:43.650\nRead &amp; Write, Read only,\nWrite only, and No Access.\n\n313\n00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:49.860\nIf I do the same thing on staff, or\nRonnie, or me, I don't have four options.\n\n314\n00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.112\nNo Access is not in the list.\n\n315\n00:15:52.112 --> 00:15:54.564\nOkay, why is No Access not on the list?\n\n316\n00:15:54.564 --> 00:15:57.061\nIf I wanna block access\nto somebody like this,\n\n317\n00:15:57.061 --> 00:15:59.312\nI just remove them from the list, right?\n\n318\n00:15:59.312 --> 00:16:02.137\nSo if Ronnie wants me to have no access,\nhe just takes me right out.\n\n319\n00:16:02.137 --> 00:16:03.924\nAnd that's that, now I have no access.\n\n320\n00:16:03.924 --> 00:16:07.288\nAnd then, Ronnie, you as the owner\ncan't give yourself no access,\n\n321\n00:16:07.288 --> 00:16:09.560\nbecause that would\neffectively lock you out.\n\n322\n00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.013\nAnd, in fact, notice how when I choose\nyou, the- button is grayed out,\n\n323\n00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:15.170\nlike you can't even remove yourself.\n\n324\n00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.934\nSo you do get different behaviors,\ndepending on what you've selected,\n\n325\n00:16:18.934 --> 00:16:21.127\nwhich item you've highlighted, right?\n\n326\n00:16:21.127 --> 00:16:26.517\nNow also, I talked about Read,\nRead &amp; Write and No Access.\n\n327\n00:16:26.517 --> 00:16:29.686\nThere was that fourth one that\nshowed up under everyone.\n\n328\n00:16:29.686 --> 00:16:32.720\nWhen I dropped it down it\nwas Write only (Drop Box).\n\n329\n00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.391\nI think it only shows up for\neveryone, right?\n\n330\n00:16:34.391 --> 00:16:36.787\nNo, it actually does show up for\ngroup and you.\n\n331\n00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.072\nI shows up for all three,\nall right, so I'm completely wrong.\n\n332\n00:16:38.072 --> 00:16:39.424\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n333\n00:16:39.424 --> 00:16:40.104\n&gt;&gt; But basically\n\n334\n00:16:40.104 --> 00:16:42.680\nyou have this other option, Write only.\n\n335\n00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.202\nNow Read only makes sense.\n\n336\n00:16:45.202 --> 00:16:48.070\nI see a file,\nI can open it I can look at it.\n\n337\n00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.670\nI just can't change it and\ndelete it, right?\n\n338\n00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.850\nThat's stuff that I can't do.\n\n339\n00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:51.910\nBut I can access the file.\n\n340\n00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.950\nWrite only, when would I want someone\nto be able to write to a file but\n\n341\n00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:57.770\nnot read it?\n\n342\n00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.250\nYou can't look at it,\nbut you can change it.\n\n343\n00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.400\nThat sounds really strange, doesn't it?\n\n344\n00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:08.290\nWell this is a dropbox, not in terms of\nlike the DropBox Cloud storage service.\n\n345\n00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:12.203\nThink more of like a bank\nnighttime deposit box, right?\n\n346\n00:17:12.203 --> 00:17:15.292\nYou may or may not have done it in\nthis day and age of Internet banking,\n\n347\n00:17:15.292 --> 00:17:16.210\nit's a lot easier.\n\n348\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.250\nBut in the olden days if you wanted\nto make a deposit at a bank and\n\n349\n00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.330\nit was after 5 PM, the bank had closed\nits doors, the lights were out.\n\n350\n00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.062\nSo you would sign your checks or\nendorse your checks.\n\n351\n00:17:27.062 --> 00:17:29.538\nYou'd stick them in an envelope,\nyou'd drive up to the bank.\n\n352\n00:17:29.538 --> 00:17:33.320\nYou'd pull open a little slot, and\nyou'd drop it down in there and close it.\n\n353\n00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.568\nOkay, what you just did was\na write only operation.\n\n354\n00:17:40.032 --> 00:17:42.275\nThe big blue postal mailbox is\nthe same kind of thing, right?\n\n355\n00:17:42.275 --> 00:17:44.050\nYou drop a letter in there.\n\n356\n00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:49.160\nYou were able to write a letter, and\nyou were able to drop it in that mailbox.\n\n357\n00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.140\nBut once it was in there, it was gone.\n\n358\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.258\nYou couldn't see what was in the box,\nright?\n\n359\n00:17:54.258 --> 00:17:57.310\nSo you couldn't read\nthe contents of that box.\n\n360\n00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.151\nAnd you can't even\nretrieve your own message.\n\n361\n00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:03.580\nYour message that you dropped in\nthere is now effectively gone.\n\n362\n00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.376\nIt's been dropped off,\nthat's what a dropbox is.\n\n363\n00:18:06.376 --> 00:18:10.946\nThe Drop Box permission inside of\nMac OS is really used when you want\n\n364\n00:18:10.946 --> 00:18:13.569\nsomebody to be able to give you files.\n\n365\n00:18:13.569 --> 00:18:16.180\nBut not give them access to anything else.\n\n366\n00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.140\nSo maybe you're a school teacher,\nright, or university professor.\n\n367\n00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.054\nAnd you tell your students, hey,\n\n368\n00:18:21.054 --> 00:18:25.087\nyou've got until midnight on Friday\nto turn in your term paper, right?\n\n369\n00:18:25.087 --> 00:18:26.031\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n370\n00:18:26.031 --> 00:18:29.918\nI don't wanna sit there at my desk\nuntil midnight on Friday, waiting for\n\n371\n00:18:29.918 --> 00:18:33.756\ndeadbeat students to come in at 11:59 PM,\ncuz you know they will.\n\n372\n00:18:33.756 --> 00:18:36.660\n[LAUGH] And so\nI don't I don't wanna do that.\n\n373\n00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.210\nSo instead I could create\na folder that's a dropbox.\n\n374\n00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:44.120\nAnd I could say, look, all the way up\nuntil 11:59 PM you can just drop your term\n\n375\n00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.410\npaper in that folder, right?\n\n376\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.270\nAnd when they do that they don't\nsee anybody else's term papers,\n\n377\n00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.190\nbecause they can't read the folder.\n\n378\n00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.041\nSo they don't know anybody\nelse's stuff is in there.\n\n379\n00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:58.040\nAnd they can drop their file in there,\nand now they can't go and change it.\n\n380\n00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.550\nThey can't delete it,\nthey can't remove it.\n\n381\n00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.170\nSo I know the first paper they submitted.\n\n382\n00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:08.320\nSo if they come in and try to submit\na paper again at 2 AM or 5 AM, I'll know,\n\n383\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.520\nbecause they're not allowed to overwrite\nthe file that's already existed.\n\n384\n00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.530\nThey dropped one in, and it's timestamped,\nand you kinda know what goes on.\n\n385\n00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.350\nSo that's the way that\na dropbox gets used.\n\n386\n00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:21.220\nIt's a pretty specific use case scenario,\nso most of us are never gonna use it.\n\n387\n00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.010\nBut we'll talk about home folder\nstructure a little bit later.\n\n388\n00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:29.620\nAnd there is actually a default\ndropbox created for every user.\n\n389\n00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.442\nIf you browse your home folder,\nthere's a folder called Public.\n\n390\n00:19:32.442 --> 00:19:35.340\nAnd in the Public folder there's\nanother folder called Drop Box.\n\n391\n00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.859\nAnd it's actually created,\nit's there by default.\n\n392\n00:19:36.859 --> 00:19:39.070\nAnd we'll look at it,\nlike I said, a little bit later.\n\n393\n00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.420\nAll right so let's see, we have\ntalked about Read &amp; Write, Read only,\n\n394\n00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.010\nWrite only, No Access.\n\n395\n00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.830\nThere's a few other permissions\nwe're gonna learn about\n\n396\n00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.660\nwhen we go into the Unix backend,\nlike the execute permission.\n\n397\n00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.030\nReading a file is just opening it and\nlooking at the contents.\n\n398\n00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:02.200\nBut executing means it's a program or\na script, and we actually want to run it.\n\n399\n00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.400\nAnd that's an extra permission that\nhere in the GUI, we don't have.\n\n400\n00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:13.560\nEven if I had a file, for example,\nlet me get to Ronnie's desktop here.\n\n401\n00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:20.909\nAnd just real quick I'm going\nto whip up a script.sh, right?\n\n402\n00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:22.790\nSo here's a script.\n\n403\n00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:27.030\nAnd when I wanna run a script,\nI need to be able to execute it.\n\n404\n00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:31.054\nWell in Mac OS, when you create a script,\nit recognizes that it's a script.\n\n405\n00:20:31.054 --> 00:20:34.451\nSo it shows up right here as script.sh,\nright?\n\n406\n00:20:34.451 --> 00:20:38.700\nAnd it even says SHELL, right,\nso it knows that it's a script.\n\n407\n00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:44.260\nBut when I pull up its information, when I\npull up its permissions and other data and\n\n408\n00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:49.090\ncome in here and look at it,\nI don't have execute as an option.\n\n409\n00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:53.780\nIn the GUI you actually can't manipulate\nwhether something's executable or not.\n\n410\n00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.480\nIt just recognizes it.\n\n411\n00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.312\nAnd if it thinks that it should be\nexecutable then it makes it executable.\n\n412\n00:20:59.312 --> 00:21:03.325\nSo that's kind of an automatic permission\nthat's hidden from us as part of the GUI,\n\n413\n00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:05.374\nnot one that we have\nto really worry about.\n\n414\n00:21:05.374 --> 00:21:09.231\nAll right, the other thing that I\nwanna mention here before we wrap up,\n\n415\n00:21:09.231 --> 00:21:13.618\nI know I've only got a few minutes left,\nis the default permissions that we see.\n\n416\n00:21:13.618 --> 00:21:17.650\nSo like looking at this one here where\nit's got Ronnie, staff, and everyone.\n\n417\n00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:22.430\nThat's the UGO that I talked about, right,\nthe user, the group, and the other.\n\n418\n00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:27.329\nNow those three are provided by\nthe default functionality in the Unix\n\n419\n00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:28.774\noperating system.\n\n420\n00:21:28.774 --> 00:21:31.981\nSo under the hood,\nunder the nice little GUI that we have,\n\n421\n00:21:31.981 --> 00:21:33.820\nis the Darwin operating system.\n\n422\n00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.700\nAnd Darwin is technically\na BSD Unix operating system.\n\n423\n00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.550\nSo it uses BSD Unix style permissions,\nU-G-O.\n\n424\n00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.068\nBut there's some limitations here, right?\n\n425\n00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:46.769\nIf I wanna give permissions to more\nthan one person or more than one group,\n\n426\n00:21:46.769 --> 00:21:48.631\nUnix doesn't really support that.\n\n427\n00:21:48.631 --> 00:21:51.950\nI have to set up nested groups and\nthings get really complex.\n\n428\n00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.150\nSo Unix permissions\nare not terribly flexible.\n\n429\n00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:58.260\nApple wanted those\npermissions to be flexible.\n\n430\n00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.600\nSo they created what were called ACLs,\nor Access Control Lists.\n\n431\n00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.486\nAnd the moment I deviate from this three\nperson model, see how each of these three\n\n432\n00:22:05.486 --> 00:22:08.300\nwhen I choose them,\nlike I can choose staff and hit minus.\n\n433\n00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:13.180\nAnd it's gonna try and take away the staff\npermission, which Isn't letting me,\n\n434\n00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.320\nbecause I don't have permissions, right?\n\n435\n00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.260\nSo I need to unlock this\nbefore I can do it.\n\n436\n00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.360\nBut when I do that,\nwhen I manipulate those permissions,\n\n437\n00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.410\nI'm starting to move\naway from the UGO model.\n\n438\n00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:27.350\nAnd that is not something\nthat's allowed in Unix.\n\n439\n00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:32.480\nSo what Apple had to do was to find\na new way to store these permissions.\n\n440\n00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.901\nSo that when you come in and\nyou do crazy things like, here, we'll add,\n\n441\n00:22:36.901 --> 00:22:39.888\nI've got a group like access.bpf or\nDon Pezet.\n\n442\n00:22:39.888 --> 00:22:43.560\nI can come in and\nstart adding these other entries.\n\n443\n00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.940\nWhat I'm doing is I'm creating\n\n444\n00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.460\na list that It goes beyond\nwhat Unix can normally track.\n\n445\n00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:54.110\nAnd so this isn't stored the way Unix\npermissions normally are stored.\n\n446\n00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:58.960\nThis is stored using an ACL,\nan Access Control List that Mac OS tracks.\n\n447\n00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.050\nThis makes sense to Mac OS,\nthis doesn't make sense to Unix.\n\n448\n00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.280\nSo in the GUI I don't have to worry\nabout that, that's all hidden from me.\n\n449\n00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.050\nI just set the permissions right here.\n\n450\n00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:13.520\nI never know when I flip from\nUnix-land To Mac OS ACL-land, right?\n\n451\n00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.340\nIt's all seamless,\nit never prompted or warned.\n\n452\n00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.270\nIt just kind of happened.\n\n453\n00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.500\nBut in the next episode when we take\na look at the Unix side of things,\n\n454\n00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.580\nwe'll see where that happens.\n\n455\n00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.910\nWe'll see where we deviate and\n\n456\n00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:29.420\nmove away from the standard way of\nhandling permissions to the ACL method.\n\n457\n00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.260\nBut do know,\nbecause it may turn up on the exam,\n\n458\n00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:37.017\nthat if you see permissions that go beyond\njust a user, a group, and everyone,\n\n459\n00:23:37.017 --> 00:23:41.561\nif it goes beyond that, then technically\nyou're dealing with with an ACL.\n\n460\n00:23:41.561 --> 00:23:44.900\nAnd not standard permission, so\nit is an Access Control List.\n\n461\n00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.870\nBut otherwise, as far as the end user's\nconcerned, they manipulate it the same,\n\n462\n00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.140\nand those are our permissions.\n\n463\n00:23:50.302 --> 00:23:53.670\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well thank you again\nfor helping to introduce us to this\n\n464\n00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:58.270\nconcept of the way that these permissions\nare actually working for Mac OS Sierra.\n\n465\n00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.315\nRemember that it really is based off that\nUnix style of permissions where you have\n\n466\n00:24:01.315 --> 00:24:02.761\nthe user, the group, and the owner.\n\n467\n00:24:02.761 --> 00:24:05.866\nEven though the names have changed,\nit's still that underneath the hood.\n\n468\n00:24:05.866 --> 00:24:09.646\nAnd that's some of the things that we'll\nhave to also be able to identify and\n\n469\n00:24:09.646 --> 00:24:10.365\nunderstand.\n\n470\n00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:13.990\nHe also showed us about\npermission inheritance, as well.\n\n471\n00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:18.770\nAnd then lastly, talked a little bit\nabout ACLs, Access Control Lists,\n\n472\n00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:22.250\nwhich we'll actually get\nmore into in a next episode.\n\n473\n00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.830\nBut that's a great place for\nus to also sign off.\n\n474\n00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.820\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n475\n00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:28.830\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n476\n00:24:28.830

00:00:08.034\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.034 --> 00:00:11.861\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:14.954\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.954 --> 00:00:19.224\nYou're watching the Apple Certified\nSupport Professional for macOS Sierra.\n\n7\n00:00:19.224 --> 00:00:20.980\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.805\nAnd we're continuing into\na part two on file permissions,\n\n9\n00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:25.870\ndoing a little bit of a deeper dive.\n\n10\n00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.960\nAnd here to help us out\nwith that is Mr Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.324\nDon, welcome again to our studios.\n\n12\n00:00:29.324 --> 00:00:30.146\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having my back, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:32.989\nIn the last episode,\nwe talked about file permissions.\n\n14\n00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.837\nAnd we stayed in the GUI for the most,\n\n15\n00:00:34.837 --> 00:00:38.004\nI think I issued one terminal\ncommand in there for some reason.\n\n16\n00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:41.628\nBut we stayed in the GUI so that we would\nkind of, we had our kid gloves on for\n\n17\n00:00:41.628 --> 00:00:42.760\nthat episode.\n\n18\n00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.451\nIn this episode,\nall of the gloves come off.\n\n19\n00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:45.248\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n20\n00:00:45.248 --> 00:00:48.873\nnow we're gonna dive into that terminal,\nand we're gonna take a look at what's\n\n21\n00:00:48.873 --> 00:00:52.420\ngoing on behind the scenes,\nas far as these permissions are concerned.\n\n22\n00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.839\nWhere we're getting this information from,\n\n23\n00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.453\nhow this is actually being\nstored on the back end.\n\n24\n00:00:57.453 --> 00:01:00.582\nAnd it's important that we recognize\nthis because from time to time,\n\n25\n00:01:00.582 --> 00:01:04.030\nyou might need to drop to a terminal to\nrepair some permissions somewhere, or\n\n26\n00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.300\nrepair some file ownership,\nfolder ownership, or whatever.\n\n27\n00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.880\nThere are other ways to do it through\nthings like disk utility, we'll talk about\n\n28\n00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.260\nthose later, but for right now, let's just\nfocus on the permission side of things.\n\n29\n00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.480\nAll right, i'm gonna get started.\n\n30\n00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.340\nI'm logged in on my laptop here,\nand i'm logged in as Ronnie,\n\n31\n00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.770\nbecause we had created a Ronnie\naccount in the last episode,\n\n32\n00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.910\nand we created a couple of files, right,\nthis data folder, there was a script.sh.\n\n33\n00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.490\nAnd, right before the show started,\n\n34\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.470\nI just created a simple text document\nhere called Term Paper, right.\n\n35\n00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.480\nSo here's a Term Paper that Ronnie's been\nworking on, we're going back to school.\n\n36\n00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.827\nIt'll be like the movie.\n\n37\n00:01:36.827 --> 00:01:38.002\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Man.\n\n38\n00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:42.027\n&gt;&gt; And if I take a look,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That movie, that file, now,\n\n39\n00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:44.980\nI'm off on the wrong tangent.\n\n40\n00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.460\nI can see the three permissions here,\nwe've got Ronnie Wong, staff, and\n\n41\n00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.990\neveryone, right?\n\n42\n00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.130\nDefault permissions like what we would\nexpect to see on a file like this,\n\n43\n00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.240\ncreated right on his desktop.\n\n44\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.620\nSo, that's his file, there it is,\nand it's got permissions.\n\n45\n00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.200\nNow, these permissions are coming from\nthe Unix system underneath the hood here,\n\n46\n00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.090\nright, so from the BSD Unix layer.\n\n47\n00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.903\nIf I open up a terminal, so\nI'm just going to fire up a terminal.\n\n48\n00:02:09.903 --> 00:02:12.392\nIf you don't know how to do that,\nyou can fire up your spotlight and\n\n49\n00:02:12.392 --> 00:02:14.534\njust type in term and\nit shows up right there, terminal.\n\n50\n00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:19.300\nIt's also under your Applications\nfolder under Utilities.\n\n51\n00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.692\nBut when we go into our prompt, if I can\nstop just randomly hitting keys here.\n\n52\n00:02:25.692 --> 00:02:29.269\nSo if we get into our terminal,\nwe might need to do a like a CMD+Shift+ to\n\n53\n00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.378\nget it to where you can actually\nread whatever is on the screen,\n\n54\n00:02:32.378 --> 00:02:35.280\ncuz it does come up a little\nbit on the small side.\n\n55\n00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.130\nBut once we're in there,\nwe can start to see the file system and\n\n56\n00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.470\nthe content inside of it from\nthe perspective of Unix.\n\n57\n00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.600\nSeeing things the way that\nthe Unix sees it, and\n\n58\n00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.650\nthat’s important because, it sees things a\nlittle differently than what the GUI does.\n\n59\n00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.180\nThe GUI extends upon that\nbase system quite a bit.\n\n60\n00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.880\nSo, when I first launched this, it's\ngonna put me into Ronnie's home folder.\n\n61\n00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.740\nSo, /users/rwong, right,\nthat's where I am.\n\n62\n00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.430\nBut the files that I created are actually\nsitting there on his desktop.\n\n63\n00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.540\nSo I need to change directory\ninto the desktop folder.\n\n64\n00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.190\nAnd so now if I look at my folder,\nI'm in /users/rwong/desktop.\n\n65\n00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.206\nNow I don't wanna turn this into\na giant Unix show, but just a couple of\n\n66\n00:03:18.206 --> 00:03:22.905\nbasic commands that can really help us\nhere, PWD is the print working directory,\n\n67\n00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:25.860\nit shows us the directory\nthat we're in right now.\n\n68\n00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.800\nSo I used pwd just to\nfigure out where I'm at.\n\n69\n00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.200\nBecause the command prompt that I'm\nseeing here is the name of the laptop,\n\n70\n00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.600\nDon's Macbook Pro.\n\n71\n00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.540\nAnd then the folder I'm in, but\n\n72\n00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.640\nit doesn't give me the whole path, right,\njust the name of the current folder.\n\n73\n00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.660\nSo I knew I was in desktop, but I didn't\nknow if I was in Ronnie's or mine or\n\n74\n00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.700\nsomebody else's desktop.\n\n75\n00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.680\nSo pwd is really helpful.\n\n76\n00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.250\ncd is change directory, we can use that\nto move into a different directory.\n\n77\n00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.670\nAnd then there's ls,\nwhich is the list command.\n\n78\n00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.910\nI can list what's in this directory.\n\n79\n00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.702\nSo, on Ronnie's desktop,\nI can see data, termpaper.rtf,\n\n80\n00:03:59.702 --> 00:04:03.850\nand scrip.sh, right, data's that\nfolder we made in the last episode.\n\n81\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.830\nI don't see all these\nhard drives over here.\n\n82\n00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.840\nRight, these hard drives made\nback in the partitioning episode.\n\n83\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.202\nThat's because those hard drives don't\nactually exist in the desktop folder.\n\n84\n00:04:12.202 --> 00:04:14.760\nIt's just a little short cut,\nso aliases are stuck here.\n\n85\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.990\nSo, they don't actually exist,\nthey're just pointers.\n\n86\n00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.010\nThey exist in different folders,\nin this /volumes folder.\n\n87\n00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.970\nIf we were to take a look at that,\nlike ls/volumes.\n\n88\n00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.940\nThere they are, right, so I can see FAT,\nexFAT, Extended, and all those guys.\n\n89\n00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.920\nBut in just his desktop,\nwe just have the individual files.\n\n90\n00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.850\nNow, the file that I made before\nthe show was called Term Paper.rtf, and\n\n91\n00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.060\nwe saw where Ronnie had read and\nwrite access to it.\n\n92\n00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.460\nStaff had read only, and\neveryone had read only.\n\n93\n00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:51.130\nAnd I said those corresponded to some Unix\npermissions, to UGO, user, group, other.\n\n94\n00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.050\nWell, I don't see that with\nthe ls command by default.\n\n95\n00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.900\nThere's actually a few\nvariations of the ls command\n\n96\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.450\nwe can use to show us more though.\n\n97\n00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.971\nAnd the one that I just\nalmost always do is ls -a.\n\n98\n00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:06.870\nls -a shows me all files.\n\n99\n00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.276\nAnd then if we attach a little bit\nmore to that, if we do ls -al,\n\n100\n00:05:12.276 --> 00:05:17.173\nthat says show me all files,\nand give me the long format.\n\n101\n00:05:17.173 --> 00:05:21.138\nAnd then the long format,\nI can see every file and\n\n102\n00:05:21.138 --> 00:05:25.150\nI can see their permissions\nright over here.\n\n103\n00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.590\nSo now when I find term paper,\nI can see term paper right here.\n\n104\n00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.790\nI can see that it is 426 bytes in size.\n\n105\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.120\nVery small, it's just a simple text file.\n\n106\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.340\nAnd then I can see the permissions on it.\n\n107\n00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.410\nAnd if you look at the permissions,\nthey are written in a really,\n\n108\n00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.540\nreally strange way.\n\n109\n00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.475\nSo let's break down what we\nare looking at here, right?\n\n110\n00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:47.300\nSo these constitute the permissions, okay?\n\n111\n00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.070\nIt's written in a way that's\nkind of unusual, right?\n\n112\n00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.214\nRight here, we've got basically 10 bits.\n\n113\n00:05:56.214 --> 00:06:02.050\nAnd these bits identify information about\nthe permissions on the file or the folder.\n\n114\n00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.090\nThe very first bit is either\ngoing to be a d or a dash.\n\n115\n00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.900\nIt'll be a d, if it's a directory, right?\n\n116\n00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.980\nThe data folder that we\nmade is a directory.\n\n117\n00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.850\nSo when I look,\nit's got a d at the beginning.\n\n118\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.521\nBut term paper.rtf and\nscript.sh those are files.\n\n119\n00:06:20.521 --> 00:06:22.510\nAnd so they start with a dash.\n\n120\n00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.067\nSo dash for file, d for directory.\n\n121\n00:06:25.067 --> 00:06:30.568\nThen, we've got 3 bits of permissions\nfollowed by 3 more bits of permissions,\n\n122\n00:06:30.568 --> 00:06:36.060\nfollowed by 3 more bits of permissions,\nright, three sets of three.\n\n123\n00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.130\nWell, they correspond to the user,\n\n124\n00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.510\nthe group, and the other, right?\n\n125\n00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.697\nThe UGO that I've mentioned\nrepeatedly now, right, the user.\n\n126\n00:06:48.697 --> 00:06:53.588\nSo whoever the user is for\nthis file, has read and write.\n\n127\n00:06:53.588 --> 00:06:58.473\nAnd then whoever the group is has read,\nand then everyone else,\n\n128\n00:06:58.473 --> 00:07:02.000\nthe other has read, that's that means.\n\n129\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.910\nThese little values here will either be r,\nw, x or a mixture or even all of them.\n\n130\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.310\nIt's like when I look at this directory,\nthis directory reaches r, w, x,\n\n131\n00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:19.280\nthat means, whoever the user is for\nthis folder, has read, write, and execute.\n\n132\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.930\nRead and write,\n\n133\n00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.870\nwe saw on the GUI, execute we didn't,\nexecute didn't show up in the GUI.\n\n134\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.020\nExecute means that not\nonly can I read this, but\n\n135\n00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.700\nif I double-click on it, it'll run and\nit'll perform an action.\n\n136\n00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.800\nIf it's a script file or an executable,\nit'll run an application.\n\n137\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.120\nIf it's a directory,\nI'll navigate into the directory, right,\n\n138\n00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.340\nso I'm executing that directory to get\nin there, so read, write and execute.\n\n139\n00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.408\nIf you look here, you'll see read write-,\nso whoever the owner of this file is,\n\n140\n00:07:46.408 --> 00:07:50.898\nis able to read from it, is able to\nwrite data into it and they can change.\n\n141\n00:07:50.898 --> 00:07:53.736\nThey can delete it if they want,\nbut they can't execute it.\n\n142\n00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:55.007\nThey can run it like a program.\n\n143\n00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:57.335\nThey don't have the execute permission.\n\n144\n00:07:57.335 --> 00:08:01.433\nWell it's Term Paper.rtf, I don't\nneed to execute it, it's just a file,\n\n145\n00:08:01.433 --> 00:08:02.390\nI need to read it.\n\n146\n00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.550\nI'll execute something else,\nlike TextEdit or Pages or\n\n147\n00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.090\nMicrosoft Word or something like that.\n\n148\n00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:13.765\nAnd when I go in to that program,\nthat program will read this text file and\n\n149\n00:08:13.765 --> 00:08:15.245\ndisplay it on the screen.\n\n150\n00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:18.065\nSo I'm not executing the text file,\n\n151\n00:08:18.065 --> 00:08:21.665\nI'm reading it into some other\napplication that I did execute.\n\n152\n00:08:21.665 --> 00:08:24.345\nSo we don't always need that execute\npermission, and the operating system\n\n153\n00:08:24.345 --> 00:08:27.160\nmanages it for us, so that we don't\nhave to worry about it, right?\n\n154\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.000\nThat's all kinda being\ndone behind the scenes.\n\n155\n00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.910\nNow I said whoever the user is,\nwho is the user?\n\n156\n00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.770\nOr whoever the group is, who's the group?\n\n157\n00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.700\nWell, that comes right after that, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.940\nSo I can see that the user is rwong, and\n\n159\n00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.020\nthe group is staff,\njust like we saw in the GUI.\n\n160\n00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.280\nNow it doesn't have a third\ncolumn here for everyone,\n\n161\n00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.250\nand that's because everyone is always\neveryone, so you don't need to print it.\n\n162\n00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:59.060\nWhen we say other, that's other,\nit's everyone and so it's just assumed.\n\n163\n00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.240\nSo we don't actually need a column for\nthat,\n\n164\n00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.650\nthat's why we only have these two columns,\nbut these can change.\n\n165\n00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.673\nStaff doesn't have to be the group,\nit could be a different group,\n\n166\n00:09:06.673 --> 00:09:08.060\nwe could change that, right?\n\n167\n00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.320\nOr Ronnie doesn't have to be the owner,\nwe could change that, too.\n\n168\n00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.740\nSo those can be modified and\n\n169\n00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.880\nhere we need to pay attention to who\nthat is that's actually attached to it.\n\n170\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.598\nBut this is the user,\nthe group, and the other.\n\n171\n00:09:19.598 --> 00:09:24.114\nNow when we modify that in the GUI\nit's really easy, we take a file,\n\n172\n00:09:24.114 --> 00:09:27.100\nlike the Term Paper, we do Get Info.\n\n173\n00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.260\nWe come in here and I say, you know what,\nI want staff to be able to write to it.\n\n174\n00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:35.160\nSo I just drop that down, I choose Read &amp;\nWrite and I'm done, staff now has read and\n\n175\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.335\nwrite, I can close that and off I go.\n\n176\n00:09:37.335 --> 00:09:43.260\nAnd in my command prompt here, in my\nTerminal, I can pull this back up and\n\n177\n00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.290\nI can do my ls -al or la,\nwhatever makes you happy.\n\n178\n00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:53.330\nAnd I can see that sure enough,\nnow, Ronnie has read write and\n\n179\n00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.920\nthe group which is staff\nhas read write also.\n\n180\n00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.910\nSo very easy to do in the GUI and\n\n181\n00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.220\nwe're actually manipulating\nthose Unix permissions.\n\n182\n00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.440\nBut you can manipulate it right\nhere from the command prompt, also.\n\n183\n00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.030\nI mean, obviously it's a Unix thing,\nso they would need some way to do it.\n\n184\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.970\nAnd so we can do that with a command\nthat's not incredibly intuitive,\n\n185\n00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.090\n[LAUGH] but it's not that bad,\nlet me just show you.\n\n186\n00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.830\nFor example, let's say I want to remove\nthe write permissions from the staff group\n\n187\n00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.290\non that Term Paper.rtf.\n\n188\n00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:27.400\nSo I added write permissions for them\na second ago, now I wanna take them away.\n\n189\n00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.130\nWell the command we use for that is\nthe chmod, or the change mode command, and\n\n190\n00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.170\nthis lets us change\nthe permissions on that file.\n\n191\n00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.610\nAnd so I'm gonna do chmod and\nthen I need to tell it what I'm doing.\n\n192\n00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.621\nAnd you start by telling\nit who you're modifying,\n\n193\n00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:46.545\nare you modifying the user,\nthe group or the other.\n\n194\n00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:50.427\nAnd so, I can say I want to modify\nthe group so I'll do g, and\n\n195\n00:10:50.427 --> 00:10:51.997\nthen what do I wanna do?\n\n196\n00:10:51.997 --> 00:10:55.160\nDo I want to add permissions or\ntake away permissions?\n\n197\n00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.953\nWell, I wanna take away,\nI wanna take away the write permissions so\n\n198\n00:10:57.953 --> 00:11:01.170\nI'm gonna do a minus,\nif I was adding, I would do a plus.\n\n199\n00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.240\nAnd then, if I wanna allow them to write,\nor execute, or whatever,\n\n200\n00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.030\nwhat permission do I wanna add?\n\n201\n00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:11.850\nAnd I wanna take away the write\npermission, so I'm saying change mode\n\n202\n00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:18.400\ng minus w, take the group and\nremove the write permission.\n\n203\n00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.460\nAnd then I need to tell it the file\nthat I'm wanting to modify or\n\n204\n00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.950\nfolder for that matter.\n\n205\n00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.810\nSo I'll say Term Paper.rtf and\nit's gonna roll under my head here,\n\n206\n00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.110\nbut pay attention,\nthere's a space in that name.\n\n207\n00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.440\nAnd that space would make\nthis look like two files,\n\n208\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.430\nyou can actually modify more\nthan one file at a time.\n\n209\n00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.150\nSo you have to do what's\ncalled escaping the space,\n\n210\n00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.260\ndo a little backslash before the space, so\nit knows that this is all one name, right?\n\n211\n00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.280\nYou could put it in quote marks also, but\nthe backslash is the easier way to go.\n\n212\n00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.270\nI use tab autocomplete, because it\nautomatically escapes the spaces for you.\n\n213\n00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:56.480\nWhen that's done, I can press Enter, and\nit's not very dramatic, is it, right,\n\n214\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.658\nit just kinda does its thing.\n\n215\n00:11:57.658 --> 00:12:02.870\nBut from here,\nif I pull up the permissions again and\n\n216\n00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.610\nI'm just gonna pull up the permissions for\nthe term paper, right?\n\n217\n00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.334\nAnd I take a look at my new permissions,\n\n218\n00:12:09.334 --> 00:12:13.886\nI can see that the group no longer\nhas write permissions, right?\n\n219\n00:12:13.886 --> 00:12:16.363\nThey had it a moment ago,\nbut I just took it away.\n\n220\n00:12:16.363 --> 00:12:20.880\nNow we can assign permissions the same\nway, we can add them right back.\n\n221\n00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.150\nSo if I were to take that same command\nthat I ran just a minute ago, and\n\n222\n00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:29.680\nchange that minus to a plus,\nwell I would be adding those permissions.\n\n223\n00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.840\nAnd you can even add more than\none permission at a time, and\n\n224\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:39.060\nmore than one object at a time,\nor person, U-G-O, right.\n\n225\n00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:46.600\nSo I could come in, and do something,\nsay chmod ugo+rw, right?\n\n226\n00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.760\nSo I'm gonna give read and\n\n227\n00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.240\nwrite permissions to the user,\nthe group and the other.\n\n228\n00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.560\nNow, the user already has read and\nwrite, so that's not really gonna change\n\n229\n00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.890\nanything, but the group and\nthe other only have read.\n\n230\n00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.180\nSo when I run this command,\n\n231\n00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.410\nI'm assigning multiple permissions to\nmultiple people all at the same time.\n\n232\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.760\nAnd now when I go and pull up those\npermissions and take a look at it,\n\n233\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:16.150\nI can see the user, the group, and the\nother all have read and write permissions.\n\n234\n00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.900\nSo the chmod command,\nit's not that hard to figure out, but\n\n235\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.970\nit's not terribly intuitive, it's\nactually way better then it used to be.\n\n236\n00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.837\nYou used to have to calculate these bit\nvalues, so for example, read, write,\n\n237\n00:13:26.837 --> 00:13:28.469\nand execute had a value of seven.\n\n238\n00:13:28.469 --> 00:13:33.210\nAnd read and execute had a value of five,\nand read and write was four or something,\n\n239\n00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:37.970\nI can't remember, you had to memorize\nthese numbers and it was annoying.\n\n240\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:42.282\nNow you just have to remember U-G-O and\nR-W-X, and between those\n\n241\n00:13:42.282 --> 00:13:46.592\nsix letters you can kind of assign\neverything that you need to have and\n\n242\n00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:48.393\nit's really not a big deal.\n\n243\n00:13:48.393 --> 00:13:51.098\nAnd then you get it in place,\nstill easier from the GUI, but\n\n244\n00:13:51.098 --> 00:13:53.210\nif you want to script and\nautomate something,\n\n245\n00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.590\nyou can do it from the command line far\nbetter than you can with GUI clicks.\n\n246\n00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.880\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, you had previously mentioned\nthat we could even change the owner\n\n247\n00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.030\nof that file.\n\n248\n00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.840\nCan we do that with the same command?\n\n249\n00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.090\n&gt;&gt; Not particularly, so there's a few\ndifferent things that we've got going on\n\n250\n00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.290\nhere, chmod is just for\nchanging the permissions.\n\n251\n00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n252\n00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.330\n&gt;&gt; And if I wanna change who the owner is,\nor change the group or\n\n253\n00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.780\nwhatever, technically,\nthat's a permission, but\n\n254\n00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.080\nit's not necessarily assigning read and\nwrite or whatever.\n\n255\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.090\nI would need to use a different\ncommand which is C-H-O-W-N,\n\n256\n00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:29.220\nchange owner, which is very similar to\nchmod, change mode, that I can go in and\n\n257\n00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.540\nI can change who that owner is and\nassign a new user or a new group.\n\n258\n00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.490\nI know it's called change owner\nlike it's a single person but\n\n259\n00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.450\nthe group goes alongside with that.\n\n260\n00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.360\nSo for example,\nif I wanted to take this term paper and\n\n261\n00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.820\nmake it where, instead of staff,\nit was some other group.\n\n262\n00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.290\nOr instead of you,\nit was me that owned it.\n\n263\n00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.334\nI could come in, and so\nif we look at it right now,\n\n264\n00:14:53.334 --> 00:14:56.408\nit shows us rwong and staff, right?\n\n265\n00:14:56.408 --> 00:14:59.399\nAnd I could say, for example, chown, and\n\n266\n00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:04.800\nthen I need to specify who I want\nthe owner and who I want the group to be.\n\n267\n00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.990\nNow if I'm changing just the owner,\nor if I'm gonna change both,\n\n268\n00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.900\nwe'll do both here for\nyou to give an example.\n\n269\n00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.830\nI would put the new owner, so\nI'll say dpezet, and then a colon And\n\n270\n00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.550\nthe new group, right?\n\n271\n00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.460\nAnd the new group, I might just leave\nit the same, it might be staff, right?\n\n272\n00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.750\nOr I've got a group called access_bpf,\nyou know, maybe I'll use that one.\n\n273\n00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:29.580\nSo now I'm going to make dpezet the owner,\naccess_bpf the group, and\n\n274\n00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.630\nthen everyone is still everyone.\n\n275\n00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.580\nAnd then I just specify that it's the term\npaper that I want to change, right?\n\n276\n00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.440\nSo I'm changing that ownership.\n\n277\n00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.264\nNow I'm logged in as you, Ronnie, and\nwhen we go to change something like that,\n\n278\n00:15:41.264 --> 00:15:44.260\nchanging the owner,\nI'm gonna get Operation not permitted.\n\n279\n00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.370\nI'm not an administrator,\nI'm logged in as a regular user, but\n\n280\n00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.375\nas an administrator,\nI can come in And do that.\n\n281\n00:15:51.375 --> 00:15:55.650\nSo I'm gonna use the sudo command to\nrun this with elevated permissions.\n\n282\n00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.994\nAnd I'll have to provide administrator\npassword, which apparently I don't know.\n\n283\n00:15:58.994 --> 00:16:02.366\n[LAUGH] And we'll get that put in there.\n\n284\n00:16:02.366 --> 00:16:04.410\nAll right well apparently I\ncan't remember my password.\n\n285\n00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.810\nBut it'll punch in, and\nthen I'll change that one over, right?\n\n286\n00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:12.240\nLet me just switch over to my account\nsince I am an administrator, and\n\n287\n00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.810\nwe'll do it from there.\n\n288\n00:16:14.928 --> 00:16:19.150\nPrivileges like these, if you create\na file, you own the file, right?\n\n289\n00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:23.020\nIt's your file, you should be able to\ndo whatever you want with it, right?\n\n290\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:29.170\nBut, as a user on the Mac, there's certain\nthings that you're not allowed to do.\n\n291\n00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.700\nAnd starting to do things\nlike manipulating the groups,\n\n292\n00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.120\nyou could potentially lock\nan administrator out of a file.\n\n293\n00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.810\nAnd then the administrator\nwould have to override it, so\n\n294\n00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.000\nyou start getting limitations\non those permissions.\n\n295\n00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:45.370\nSo for example, here,\nI'll just take a file like file.txt.\n\n296\n00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:49.940\nAnd if I take a look at it right now,\nI'm the owner and\n\n297\n00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.070\nstaff is the group that's attached to it.\n\n298\n00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.470\nSo I might come in a do\nsomething like C-H-O-W-N.\n\n299\n00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.618\nI'll keep me as the owner, but\nI'll make that access_bpf the group,\n\n300\n00:17:00.618 --> 00:17:03.020\nfor my file.txt.\n\n301\n00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.270\nAnd so I'm gonna change that group, and\nnow when I look at the permissions,\n\n302\n00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.910\nI can see instead of staff,\nI've got access_bpf.\n\n303\n00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.370\nSo I've got that new group attached to it.\n\n304\n00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:15.930\nNow I can still go back and\nuse chmod, right?\n\n305\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.720\nChange mode, and go in and\nmodify the permissions assigned to it.\n\n306\n00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.520\nBut as far as changing that owner,\nI would use chown.\n\n307\n00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:28.190\nNow if I'm not changing the owner,\nif I'm just changing the group, right?\n\n308\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.820\nOr if I'm just changing the owner,\nI can leave the other piece off but\n\n309\n00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.380\nyou still have to have the colon.\n\n310\n00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.190\nSo for example,\nif I wanted to make Ronnie the owner but\n\n311\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.350\nI wanted to leave group alone.\n\n312\n00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.920\nI could say rwong: like that and\njust leave the group empty.\n\n313\n00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.040\nAnd that means leave it at whatever it is.\n\n314\n00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.840\nSo if I want to put that back to staff,\nfor example.\n\n315\n00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.260\nI could say :staff and it would\nknow leave the owner as dpezet and\n\n316\n00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.100\nthen make the group staff again.\n\n317\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.950\nOr if you're just not sure what it was,\nyou can always type it in.\n\n318\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.570\nIt doesn't matter if you type\nit a second time like that.\n\n319\n00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:00.998\nAnd then it'll put it back to what it was,\n\n320\n00:18:00.998 --> 00:18:04.790\nso now I'm back to dpezet and\nstaff, right?\n\n321\n00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.870\nNow each time here I've been\napplying these permissions and\n\n322\n00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.680\nchanges to a single file.\n\n323\n00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.120\nYou can do it to an entire folder.\n\n324\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.870\nLet me switch back to Ronnie's account\ncuz he's got that nice little data folder\n\n325\n00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:14.820\nin place.\n\n326\n00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.400\nAnd so in his data folder, if he wants to\nchange the permission on the parent folder\n\n327\n00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.137\nand every thing underneath it chmod and\n\n328\n00:18:23.137 --> 00:18:27.150\nchown both have a -R command line tag.\n\n329\n00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.280\nAnd that command line modifier\nsays make it recursive,\n\n330\n00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.830\nit'll apply to everything underneath it.\n\n331\n00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:39.600\nSo if he were to do a chmod g+w granting\n\n332\n00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.870\nwrite permission to the data folder.\n\n333\n00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:49.980\nHe could add, I'm gonna go back here to\nthe beginning of the line, a -R, right?\n\n334\n00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.760\nAnd I'm doing a capital R,\nand the reason I do this.\n\n335\n00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.170\nThere are some systems that\nneed it to a capital R,\n\n336\n00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.010\nsome that need it to be a lower case r.\n\n337\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.214\nMacs actually accept both, and\n\n338\n00:18:59.214 --> 00:19:02.430\nI've kind of gotten into the habit of just\nalways doing a capital R on this one.\n\n339\n00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.980\nSo be aware that there are some variations\nif you're reading text books out there.\n\n340\n00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.380\nBut a capital R will certainly\ntake care of the job for us.\n\n341\n00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.440\nSo I'm gonna do chmod -R\nto make it recursive, and\n\n342\n00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.560\nthen I'm going to give\nthe group write permission.\n\n343\n00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.430\nAnd that will apply to the data folder,\nand everything inside of it,\n\n344\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.620\nall of the other folders and\nthings that are inside of it.\n\n345\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.030\nIt will basically parse down\nthrough those recursively and\n\n346\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.650\nhit every single one of them.\n\n347\n00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.060\nI can do the same thing with C-H-O-W-N.\n\n348\n00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:34.110\nAnd so I can take it and\ndo a -R and specify a new owner,\n\n349\n00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:38.880\nfor example like access_bpf and\nthen specify that data folder.\n\n350\n00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.510\nAnd it'll go through and change that\ngroup all the way down the line.\n\n351\n00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.790\nSo just another way to go in and\napply that.\n\n352\n00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.600\n&gt;&gt; Don, we've been taking a look at\nall these different permissions for\n\n353\n00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.888\nthe user and\nof course the group and the owner.\n\n354\n00:19:50.888 --> 00:19:54.660\nBut in an earlier episode we talked\nabout permissions beyond that,\n\n355\n00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.930\nsuch as using ACLs.\n\n356\n00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.060\nHow do we affect those here?\n\n357\n00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.310\n&gt;&gt; All right, look,\nlet's talk about that a little bit, right.\n\n358\n00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:03.000\nSo the Unix world, what we've just seen,\nthat's it, that's all it can do.\n\n359\n00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.740\nWe can't do anything extra,\nno magic to it beyond that.\n\n360\n00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.720\nIf I wanna add more than one user,\nI can't.\n\n361\n00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.500\nIf I wanna add more than one group I\ncan't, don't have that functionality.\n\n362\n00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.050\nBut in the GUI we saw where we could,\nwe could add more than one user.\n\n363\n00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:19.860\nWe could add more than one group, and\nwhen you do that you're breaking Unix.\n\n364\n00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.890\nAnd so what happens is\nApple is tacking on an ACL.\n\n365\n00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.540\nSo if we take something like\nRonnie's term paper here.\n\n366\n00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.860\nAnd I'm gonna pull it up and\n\n367\n00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:32.640\nI'm gonna go to its permissions,\nand I'll add, let's add me.\n\n368\n00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.505\nSo I'm gonna add me to it,\nI'll get read access, and\n\n369\n00:20:35.505 --> 00:20:37.560\nmaybe we'll add the Administrators group.\n\n370\n00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.530\nWe'll go ahead and punch them in,\n\n371\n00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.710\nand we'll let the Administrators\nhave read and write.\n\n372\n00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.660\nOkay, so I've added two groups and\ntwo users, right?\n\n373\n00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.130\nSo this is really powerful, this is crazy.\n\n374\n00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.875\nWell, we've just broken Unix.\n\n375\n00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:55.540\n[LAUGH] And so if I go to his desktop and\ntake a look at what's on his desktop.\n\n376\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.670\nAnd I find that term paper right here,\nI can look and\n\n377\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:03.070\nsee user, group, other, rwong and staff.\n\n378\n00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.770\nWhere's dpezet,\nwhere's Administrator, right?\n\n379\n00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.680\nWell, notice this little @,\nthis @ symbol tells me\n\n380\n00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.560\nthere is more stuff\ntacked on to this file.\n\n381\n00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.910\nAnd that more stuff could be permissions,\nand it could be metadata,\n\n382\n00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.630\nlet's talk about metadata.\n\n383\n00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.690\nWhen I do a get info one\nof these little files,\n\n384\n00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.750\nthere's a lot more in here\nthan just permissions.\n\n385\n00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:29.530\nI mean, I keep jumping to this permissions\nblock, but you can have comments.\n\n386\n00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.400\nThis paper is awesome, right?\n\n387\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.190\nOr whatever, we can have comments,\nyou can have tags.\n\n388\n00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.790\nI'm going to tag this as orange, right?\n\n389\n00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:41.820\nWell, it's a term paper so lets tag it\nas red, so [LAUGH] red alert right?\n\n390\n00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:45.080\nSo we can have these tags,\nwhere is that stored?\n\n391\n00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:50.420\nWell, there are some files,\nlike PDFs, PNGs, graphics files,\n\n392\n00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.400\nwhere they support internal metadata,\nright?\n\n393\n00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.050\nLike who the author was,\nwhen the photo was taken?\n\n394\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.870\nThat metadata gets stored inside it.\n\n395\n00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.990\nBut here, we're talking about\noperating system files.\n\n396\n00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.250\nWe're talking about files\nthat are just stored\n\n397\n00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.240\nthat we don't necessarily know much about.\n\n398\n00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.700\nI might not have the ability to\nstore metadata inside of it.\n\n399\n00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.850\nSo what Apple is doing is creating\na separate collection of metadata and\n\n400\n00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.760\nstoring it alongside the file,\nright beside it.\n\n401\n00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:18.690\nNow, If you have\nthe Mac OS Extended Journaled file system,\n\n402\n00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.140\nthis is completely invisible to you.\n\n403\n00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.510\nIt's part of the file system that's\nstoring this metadata, right?\n\n404\n00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:28.660\nSo, the OS simply shows\nit to us as an @ symbol.\n\n405\n00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.130\nBut in reality, there's actually\ntwo term paper files right now.\n\n406\n00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.370\nThere's termpaper.rtf that\nI see right here, and\n\n407\n00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:41.580\nthen there's another one\nthat's ._termpaper.rtf.\n\n408\n00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:47.370\nSame file name, with a ._ before it, and\nthat file contains the extra metadata.\n\n409\n00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:51.660\nNow I don't see that here,\nunless I modify my LS command.\n\n410\n00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:59.238\nThere's two variations I want to show you,\nls -lae shows me the extended permissions.\n\n411\n00:22:59.238 --> 00:23:05.360\nAnd ls -la@ shows me the other meta data.\n\n412\n00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:10.270\nSo if I do the @ here,\nI'll just do the @, and I can see this\n\n413\n00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.400\ndirectory listing just got a lot bigger,\nand it's all term paper's fault.\n\n414\n00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.660\nThe data folder is just one line,\nthere's no special metadata on it.\n\n415\n00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.480\nBut the term paper,\n\n416\n00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:25.250\nwell on the term paper I added a user\ncomment and I added user tags.\n\n417\n00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:30.635\nAnd so it's showing that I've got 50 bytes\nof user tags and 66 bytes of comments.\n\n418\n00:23:30.635 --> 00:23:35.165\nAnd whatever the heck this label thing is,\nI don't even know what that is.\n\n419\n00:23:35.165 --> 00:23:38.865\nSo there's extra metadata that's\nbeen attached to this file, and\n\n420\n00:23:38.865 --> 00:23:40.557\nit's being represented here.\n\n421\n00:23:40.557 --> 00:23:42.855\nAll right, so I know that that's there.\n\n422\n00:23:42.855 --> 00:23:44.945\nOn the permissions side,\nwe can actually see it.\n\n423\n00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:47.876\nLike I can't see what that comment is,\nthere is a way to dig in and see,\n\n424\n00:23:47.876 --> 00:23:49.089\nit's just really complex.\n\n425\n00:23:49.089 --> 00:23:53.939\nBut on the permissions side, instead\nof an @ if we just do the e ls -lae.\n\n426\n00:23:53.939 --> 00:23:58.355\nIt shows me the ACL, and you'll see\nwhere almost every file has an ACL,\n\n427\n00:23:58.355 --> 00:24:00.700\nwe just don't normally see it.\n\n428\n00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:06.060\nBut if I take the term paper,\nin fact let me just get term paper so\n\n429\n00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.540\nthe screen's a little easier to read here,\nright?\n\n430\n00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:15.485\nI can see my first ACL entry is a group\nentry, and the group is admin allow\n\n431\n00:24:15.485 --> 00:24:18.700\nread,write,append,readattr,writeattr, and\nso on.\n\n432\n00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:23.030\nAnd then there's a user value for\ndpezet, allow read, write, and so on.\n\n433\n00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:23.960\nWhere's Romey?\n\n434\n00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.770\nWhere's staff?\n\n435\n00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:25.310\nWhere's everyone?\n\n436\n00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.440\nWell those are on the Unix permissions.\n\n437\n00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.490\nSo when we went to an ACL, it's not\nthat we threw the Unix permissions away.\n\n438\n00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:31.320\nThey're still there.\n\n439\n00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.860\nWe have to have them for full Posix\ncompatibility and all that stuff.\n\n440\n00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.800\nBut the extra permissions\nwere stored in the metadata.\n\n441\n00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.850\nThey were stored alongside the file,\nand so they're represented here, and\n\n442\n00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:49.510\nI only see them when I do that dash E\non a LS command to list them out and\n\n443\n00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.940\nsee them, but they are there.\n\n444\n00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.030\nYou can manipulate them.\n\n445\n00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.420\nYou can work with them from here.\n\n446\n00:24:54.710 --> 00:25:02.140\nI was using chmod earlier in doing the UGO\nwith chmod to add read, write, or execute.\n\n447\n00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.540\nThere's actually a a command.\n\n448\n00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:10.080\nI can do chmod with a plus or\nminus a to add or remove permissions.\n\n449\n00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.040\nSo for example dpezet I have allow for\nall these read options.\n\n450\n00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.736\nBut I don't have any write permissions,\nokay?\n\n451\n00:25:16.736 --> 00:25:23.160\nI can say chmod +a, verses minus a,\nso these are modifying attributes.\n\n452\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.080\nI'm adding it or removing an attribute.\n\n453\n00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.770\nSo I'm going to do a plus a,\nand then I can come in and\n\n454\n00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:31.950\nthis is where it gets a little less user\nfriendly, and I can say for example,\n\n455\n00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:39.160\n\"dpezet allow write\", okay?\n\n456\n00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.430\nAnd you have to put it in\nquotes cuz of the spaces, and\n\n457\n00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:42.910\nyou could have more than one command.\n\n458\n00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:46.045\nI could be allowing read,write.\n\n459\n00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.790\nAnd then I specify the file, so\nI'll do the Term Paper, okay?\n\n460\n00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:56.010\nAnd when I do that,\nit's gonna add those permissions, and\n\n461\n00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:01.860\nif I do an ls-e, or I'm doing lae,\nso I get the full output on it.\n\n462\n00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.668\nNow I can come in and I can look, and\nI can see that dpezet has read and\n\n463\n00:26:05.668 --> 00:26:07.320\nwrite permissions.\n\n464\n00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.360\nNow be careful when you do this,\n\n465\n00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.160\nbecause you'll find that the GUI\nassigns a little more than just write.\n\n466\n00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.640\nLook at the group up here, it has write.\n\n467\n00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.570\nBut, it also has append, okay?\n\n468\n00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.190\nIn other words,\nit can add on to the end of the file.\n\n469\n00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.590\nI can't do that.\n\n470\n00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:26.480\nI can replace the file by writing to it,\nbut I can't add on to the end of it.\n\n471\n00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.750\nI also can't write an attribute.\n\n472\n00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.210\nThe group can, I can't,\nbecause I didn't add those.\n\n473\n00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.460\nI have to make sure that I add\nall those little components or\n\n474\n00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.640\nvarious things might not work.\n\n475\n00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.530\nSo the GUI knows to do that.\n\n476\n00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:39.410\nFrom the command line,\n\n477\n00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:43.810\nwe have to remember to do those extra\nthings to make sure that we get\n\n478\n00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:48.470\nall that extra functionality that we might\nend up missing if we don't punch it in.\n\n479\n00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.240\nAll right, but those can be manipulated.\n\n480\n00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.070\nAnother place where you might see this,\nand if you're in an all-Mac world,\n\n481\n00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.900\nthis is all transparent to you, so\nmost of us don't even think about it.\n\n482\n00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.910\nBut if you integrate with\nWindows machines, and\n\n483\n00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.610\nyou go to share a file with somebody.\n\n484\n00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.930\nSomebody says, hey,\ncan you give me a copy of that term paper?\n\n485\n00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.790\nAnd you say, say,\nhere let me copy it to a thumb drive.\n\n486\n00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.570\nAnd the thumb drive is formatted\nwith something like ExFAT, right?\n\n487\n00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.910\nSo I've got my ExFAT partition\nfrom our file partition show.\n\n488\n00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.888\nIf I take that Term Paper and I'm gonna\njust drop it right over there on ExFAT.\n\n489\n00:27:18.888 --> 00:27:24.294\nWhen I do that it's going to copy it over,\nand sometimes you'll get a warning and\n\n490\n00:27:24.294 --> 00:27:29.900\nit'll say, are you sure you want to\ncopy this over with no metadata?\n\n491\n00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.467\nWell that means the file system\nthat you're copying to just doesn't\n\n492\n00:27:32.467 --> 00:27:33.226\nsupport metadata.\n\n493\n00:27:33.226 --> 00:27:37.295\nSome of the older ones don't and they\nget really kind of angry about it, and\n\n494\n00:27:37.295 --> 00:27:38.923\nthey'll lose the metadata.\n\n495\n00:27:38.923 --> 00:27:40.020\nWell, you might be okay with that.\n\n496\n00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.500\nLike, I don't care about the metadata,\njust send it over.\n\n497\n00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.260\nBecause here for example,\nExFAT doesn't support file permissions.\n\n498\n00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.340\nSo what do I care if I\nlose the file permissions?\n\n499\n00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.370\nIt's not that big of a deal, so\nI might not worry about that.\n\n500\n00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:55.985\nBut what Apple tries to do, and what it\ndid do in my case, is it says I want to\n\n501\n00:27:55.985 --> 00:27:59.445\npreserve the metadata, but\nthis file system doesn't support it.\n\n502\n00:27:59.445 --> 00:28:02.755\nSo instead we're gonna take the metadata\nand store it in that second file.\n\n503\n00:28:02.755 --> 00:28:04.945\nThe file I mentioned that was hidden and\ntransparent.\n\n504\n00:28:04.945 --> 00:28:06.355\nSee how I don't see it here?\n\n505\n00:28:06.355 --> 00:28:08.135\nBut if you give this to a Windows user,\nand\n\n506\n00:28:08.135 --> 00:28:12.565\nthey plug it into a Windows computer,\nthey'll actually see something else.\n\n507\n00:28:12.565 --> 00:28:15.421\nWhat they'll see, let me see if I can\nshow you here, I'm pretty sure I can.\n\n508\n00:28:18.383 --> 00:28:22.192\nSo I'm just switching into this\n/Volumes/ExFAT folder with that hard drive\n\n509\n00:28:22.192 --> 00:28:23.380\nas mounted.\n\n510\n00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:28.620\nAnd if I do an ls-la in there,\nthere it is.\n\n511\n00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:34.962\nSee I'll got Term Paper.rtf and\n._Term Paper.rtf.\n\n512\n00:28:34.962 --> 00:28:39.770\nIf I were to just pull up an ls,\neven a long listing, I don't see that.\n\n513\n00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:43.300\nI have to tell it to show all files,\nincluding hidden files.\n\n514\n00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.450\nFiles that start with a dot\nare hidden by default.\n\n515\n00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:49.820\nAnd there it is,\nthat's where the metadata is stored, so\n\n516\n00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:55.650\nthe extra ACL permissions, the tag that\nI gave it, the comments I give it.\n\n517\n00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:58.690\nThey're all in that metadata file and\nthat's what that extra little bit is.\n\n518\n00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.630\nSo it ties into permissions because\nthese are extra values that've got to be\n\n519\n00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.670\nstored some where, and on a Mac we\nwon't see it, but Windows users will.\n\n520\n00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:08.926\nAnd sometimes Windows users will say what\nare these extra garbage files let me just\n\n521\n00:29:08.926 --> 00:29:10.292\ndelete all those out of there, and\n\n522\n00:29:10.292 --> 00:29:14.320\nthey'll delete all the files that start\nwith ._ and it wont effect them one bit.\n\n523\n00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.250\nBut then when you bring it back to yours,\nand you plug it into your Mac all your\n\n524\n00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:21.590\ncomments are gone, all your tags are gone,\nand your permissions are messed up.\n\n525\n00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.110\nAnd that's kind of the nature of\nthe beast there when you share with\n\n526\n00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.230\nanother system like that.\n\n527\n00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:29.985\nWhat would have been better is to have\nmade a shared folder on your system.\n\n528\n00:29:29.985 --> 00:29:33.015\nAnd they could have browsed over\nthe network and accessed your files,\n\n529\n00:29:33.015 --> 00:29:35.705\nand they never would\nhave seen the metadata.\n\n530\n00:29:35.705 --> 00:29:38.345\nAnd they could work with the files,\nand your metadata would be preserved.\n\n531\n00:29:38.345 --> 00:29:42.297\nThat's always better than copying to some\nfile system that just doesn't have full\n\n532\n00:29:42.297 --> 00:29:43.127\nsupport for what we do.\n\n533\n00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:48.089\nAll right, I think that's\nprobably a pretty good rundown.\n\n534\n00:29:48.089 --> 00:29:51.857\nWe're gonna talk a little bit more\nabout some of the other things,\n\n535\n00:29:51.857 --> 00:29:54.477\nbut one last thing,\nthis might turn up on the exam.\n\n536\n00:29:54.477 --> 00:29:58.000\nThat little metadata file,\nthat system that I just showed you.\n\n537\n00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.900\nIt has a name.\n\n538\n00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.860\nIt's actually called\nthe AppleDouble metadata, right?\n\n539\n00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.050\nApple double.\n\n540\n00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:07.360\nThat means that when you're on a normal\nApple Mac OS formatted file system,\n\n541\n00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.580\nit's stored as part of file system.\n\n542\n00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:09.910\nThere's no second file.\n\n543\n00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:13.007\nBut we dump it to these other file\nsystems it creates that second file.\n\n544\n00:30:13.007 --> 00:30:14.460\nThey call that the

aware.\n\n547\n00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.522\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, well thank you again for\nhelping us to get\n\n548\n00:30:22.522 --> 00:30:26.812\ndeeper dive on being able to take a look\nat these different file permissions,\n\n549\n00:30:26.812 --> 00:30:30.772\nnot only the underlying Unix, but\nalso of course even how we can go in and\n\n550\n00:30:30.772 --> 00:30:33.947\nsee the access control list as well and\nchange those too.\n\n551\n00:30:33.947 --> 00:30:36.610\nMake sure you pay attention to\nsome of those commands, right?\n\n552\n00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:40.910\nSuch as

00:00:08.551\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:11.673\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.673 --> 00:00:14.299\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.621\nYou're watching the Apple Certified\nSupport Professional for MacOS Sierra.\n\n7\n00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:20.750\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.990\nToday we're taking a look at a part three.\n\n9\n00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.370\nHopefully finishing up some details\nhere on file permissions and\n\n10\n00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.020\nhere to help us to wrap everything up,\nMr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.170\nDon, welcome back to the studio.\n\n12\n00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.250\n&gt;&gt; Same coming back, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.544\nAnd yeah, I know it is part three.\n\n14\n00:00:32.544 --> 00:00:33.731\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But there's a lot of details,\n\n15\n00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:35.980\na lot of information we need to\nknow about file permissions.\n\n16\n00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.630\nAnd in the first two\nepisodes I really focused on\n\n17\n00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.040\nthe actual permissions themselves and\nhow we assign them and change them.\n\n18\n00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.620\nIn this episode, I wanna back away from\nchanging permissions and just take a look\n\n19\n00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.540\nat some of the default permissions\nthat are applied to our file system.\n\n20\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.410\nThat when you create a user\naccount there's a certain folder\n\n21\n00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.110\nstructure that's put in place.\n\n22\n00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.148\nAnd there's different\npermissions in different areas.\n\n23\n00:00:54.148 --> 00:00:56.900\nSo I wanna walk you through some\nof the defaults that you're\n\n24\n00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.290\nmore than welcome to go back and\nchange after the fact.\n\n25\n00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.866\nBut that are there by default on\nevery Mac system that we deploy.\n\n26\n00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:07.540\nAll right, so where I wanna start\nis with the home directory.\n\n27\n00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.084\nI've got this user account that\nwe made for Ronnie Wong, right.\n\n28\n00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:12.200\nI made it in part one.\n\n29\n00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.556\nAnd all I've done is create a bunch\nof junk on his desktop really,\n\n30\n00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:16.710\n[LAUGH] that's about it.\n\n31\n00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.560\nBut as far as the basic permissions for\n\n32\n00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.960\nhis home folder I really\nhaven't messed with that.\n\n33\n00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.660\nSo let's take a look at what those\npermissions are like from the file system.\n\n34\n00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.440\nI mean we could see it through the GUI but\na lot of stuff gets hidden in the GUI.\n\n35\n00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.330\nIf I were to go up into his home folder\nI could see that he has desktop,\n\n36\n00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.430\ndocuments, downloads, movies,\nmusic, pictures, and public, right?\n\n37\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.440\nThese are the folders in his home.\n\n38\n00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.490\nAnd the majority of these\nhave the same permissions.\n\n39\n00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.200\nThey have what Ronnie has read and write\naccess it and staff will have read access.\n\n40\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.185\nOr even no access depending\non which folder it is.\n\n41\n00:01:53.185 --> 00:01:56.140\nThere's some slight variations and\nthat's what I want to highlight here.\n\n42\n00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.951\nNow instead of doing it from\nthe GUI though I'm gonna do it\n\n43\n00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:58.793\nfrom the command prompt.\n\n44\n00:01:58.793 --> 00:02:03.413\nBecause it is a little bit easier from the\nterminal, because I can just go right into\n\n45\n00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:07.058\nhis home directory which where\nit defaulted to /Users/rwong.\n\n46\n00:02:07.058 --> 00:02:12.039\nAnd if I do an is I can pull up\nthe long listing of the folders and\n\n47\n00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:14.695\nfiles that are inside of there.\n\n48\n00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:19.730\nAnd I can see desktop, documents,\ndownloads, library and so on.\n\n49\n00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.530\nAnd only one of them library\n\n50\n00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.080\nhas has an at symbol on it which\nmeans extended attributes.\n\n51\n00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.310\nIt may have additional\npermissions assigned to it but\n\n52\n00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.320\nall of the other ones\ndon't have the at symbol.\n\n53\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.350\nSo they just have permissions\nthat are assigned right here.\n\n54\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.270\nAnd if I look they're almost all the same,\ndrwx and the dashes.\n\n55\n00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.238\nRemember from the last episode if we did\nmatch it, d means the directories, right?\n\n56\n00:02:46.238 --> 00:02:49.260\nSo it's not really a permission,\nit's just saying that this is a directory.\n\n57\n00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.900\nAnd then after that the owner or the user\nRonnie has read, write, and execute.\n\n58\n00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.170\nExecute means he's allowed to open\nthe folder and go inside of it.\n\n59\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.997\nRead and write means he can read\neverything in the folder as well as delete\n\n60\n00:03:01.997 --> 00:03:02.757\neverything.\n\n61\n00:03:02.757 --> 00:03:06.262\nAnd even delete the folder himself\nif he wants not be a good idea but\n\n62\n00:03:06.262 --> 00:03:08.780\nhe could he has that permission.\n\n63\n00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.180\nAnd then the group in this case,\n\n64\n00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.008\nstaff which is everybody else in this\nlaptop doesn't have access to this folder.\n\n65\n00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:20.900\nAnd the other everyone\nelse people on network for\n\n66\n00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.220\nexample of the guest user account,\nthey don't have access.\n\n67\n00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.920\nSo only Ronnie has access\nto his desktop folder.\n\n68\n00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.180\nOnly Ronnie has access to documents,\ndownloads, library,\n\n69\n00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.310\nmovies, musics, pictures.\n\n70\n00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.115\nAnd then we get to the last one,\nthe one that my heads covering up.\n\n71\n00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:39.185\nPublic, and Public has some different\n\n72\n00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:45.150\npermissions drwxr-xr-x,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n73\n00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.150\nWell that means that it's a directory,\nRonnie has read, write, and executes so\n\n74\n00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.440\njust like all the others.\n\n75\n00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.860\nBut then staff,\neverybody on their laptop or desktop,\n\n76\n00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.510\nor Mac, Mini, whatever it is that\nyou have has read and execute.\n\n77\n00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.000\nThat means anybody can navigate\ninto Ronnie's public folder and\n\n78\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.340\nother, in other words the everyone grou,\ncan navigate into Ronnie's public folder.\n\n79\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.920\nAnd they have read access.\n\n80\n00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.120\nThe reason that's done is this folder is\ndesigned to be shockingly public, right?\n\n81\n00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.080\nIf Ronnie has a folder that he wants to\nshare with people he wants somebody to\n\n82\n00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.480\nlook at his term paper.\n\n83\n00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.460\nWell he can create a custom folder and\nshare it out and set permissions or\n\n84\n00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.880\nhe can just drop it right\nin this public folder.\n\n85\n00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.523\nAnd when he does that people will\nbe able to navigate in and see it.\n\n86\n00:04:29.523 --> 00:04:36.020\nSo for example we can go to his desktop\nand I'll make a copy of that term paper.\n\n87\n00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.558\nI'm just gonna use the command\nc to copy that one and\n\n88\n00:04:39.558 --> 00:04:42.202\nI'll go back into his public folder.\n\n89\n00:04:42.202 --> 00:04:46.660\nAnd I'll just paste it right in there and\nnow it's in the public folder.\n\n90\n00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.490\nAnybody can navigate to it and\nhave access, right?\n\n91\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.600\nSo if I switch back over to my account.\n\n92\n00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.900\nSo I'm gonna jump back over to Don.\n\n93\n00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.230\nAnd in my account if I try and browse to\nRonnie's folder what I'm I gonna see?\n\n94\n00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.130\nWell I'm gonna see something\nkinda interesting.\n\n95\n00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:10.380\nSo let me go into my hard drive and I'm\ngonna browse in to users and then rwong.\n\n96\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.830\nAnd when I browse into Ronnie's folder\nlook how the folders are listed.\n\n97\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.020\nI see all the folders.\n\n98\n00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.850\nI see his Desktop, Documents,\nDownloads, Movies, Music, and Pictures.\n\n99\n00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.143\nBut I can't get into them, right.\n\n100\n00:05:21.143 --> 00:05:23.620\nWhich I try to go into Pictures,\nI don't have permission.\n\n101\n00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.550\nNow I'm an administrator, I could change\nthe permissions and get in there.\n\n102\n00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.120\nBut a normal user won't\nbe able to do that.\n\n103\n00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.480\nBut Public doesn't have that red\ncircle and I can navigate in there.\n\n104\n00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.074\nAnd there's the Term Paper, I can see it,\nI can open it and there it is,\n\n105\n00:05:38.074 --> 00:05:40.000\nI'm reading his term paper.\n\n106\n00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.800\nGood work, Ronnie.\n\n107\n00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.400\nSo that's what the Public\nfolder's designed for,\n\n108\n00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.870\nit's got different permissions.\n\n109\n00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.140\nNow inside of Public, there's yet\nanother folder called Drop Box.\n\n110\n00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.840\nAnd it has even more\ndifferent permissions, right.\n\n111\n00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.510\nI talked about these in the last episode.\n\n112\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.230\nThis is where people have write only,\nthat I could come in here and\n\n113\n00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.680\nI could write a file.\n\n114\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.140\nSo for example, I'm gonna make\na copy of Ronnie's term paper and\n\n115\n00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.320\nI'm gonna rename it here.\n\n116\n00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.480\nI'll call it Don's Term Paper, right?\n\n117\n00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.659\nSo now it's my term paper.\n\n118\n00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.310\nWhoops, and I'm gonna lose it.\n\n119\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.105\nSo that's down here.\n\n120\n00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:18.560\nAll right, and [COUGH] In Ronnie's folder\nif I were to come in here and try and\n\n121\n00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.120\ncopy that into his public\nfolder I don't have permission.\n\n122\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.264\nIt's telling me I need to\nbe an administrator or\n\n123\n00:06:24.264 --> 00:06:26.740\neven provide a password,well\nI don't wanna do that.\n\n124\n00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.120\nI just did on permission.\n\n125\n00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.060\nAnd I can't put it on his desktop because\nI don't have permission to get into his\n\n126\n00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.510\ndesktop folder.\n\n127\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.530\nAnd I can't even put\nit in his home folder.\n\n128\n00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.780\nI have access to browse\ninto his home folder, but\n\n129\n00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.930\nI don't have access to start\nwriting stuff into it.\n\n130\n00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.930\nBut if I go into public and I go into\nDrop Box I can't even list the Drop Box.\n\n131\n00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.000\nBut what I can do is I can take\nthat term paper drag it and\n\n132\n00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.180\ndrop it right on the Drop Box, okay?\n\n133\n00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.084\nAnd it's warning me It says,\nyou can put items into the Drop Box but\n\n134\n00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:01.381\nyou won't be able to see them,\ndo you want to continue?\n\n135\n00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:05.200\nOther users with sufficient permissions\nwill be able to use the items.\n\n136\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.810\nI'm basically giving this to Ronnie,\nand when I say okay, it goes to him.\n\n137\n00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:10.490\nI can't see it.\n\n138\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.026\nI can't even get it back.\n\n139\n00:07:11.026 --> 00:07:13.050\nAnd the wrong one, let me get that back.\n\n140\n00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.520\nI can't.\n\n141\n00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.260\nIf I double click on it,\nI don't have access, right?\n\n142\n00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.280\nBut he does.\n\n143\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.360\nIt's in his Drop Box,\nso he has that access.\n\n144\n00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.350\nSo that's why we have a public folder,\nso that people can browse in the public\n\n145\n00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.890\nfolder to get to the drop\nbox to make use of it.\n\n146\n00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.100\nYou may not use it you can delete the Drop\nBox if you don't use it, if you don't want\n\n147\n00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.800\nit but it's there, it doesn't really\nhurt anything to have it there.\n\n148\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.774\nPeople can just put stuff in it.\n\n149\n00:07:34.774 --> 00:07:40.022\nAnd if I switch back to Ronnie's\naccount for him if he browses into his\n\n150\n00:07:40.022 --> 00:07:46.150\nown Drop Box there's Don's Term Paper,\nsitting right there on the disc.\n\n151\n00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.094\nAnd if we look at the permissions\nassigned to this, right.\n\n152\n00:07:48.094 --> 00:07:51.429\nSo if I go into his public folder and\n\n153\n00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:56.265\nI'm gonna do an ls -l,\nand I can see the Dropbox.\n\n154\n00:07:56.265 --> 00:07:59.192\nSo there's the Dropbox and notice how.\n\n155\n00:07:59.192 --> 00:08:03.650\nThe group has right and\nexecute but not read.\n\n156\n00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.210\nAnd the everyone,\nwhoops [LAUGH] it's not what I want.\n\n157\n00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.480\nEveryone has write and\nexecute but not read, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.640\nSo those permissions are right there and\n\n159\n00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:20.020\nthen if I go to the Dropbox folder itself\nwhich he can because he has permissions.\n\n160\n00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.980\nAnd I do a look, there's Don's Term Paper.\n\n161\n00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.810\nNow, notice on Don's\nterm paper that I have.\n\n162\n00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.970\nBut the staff group, has read access,\nand everyone has read access.\n\n163\n00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.919\nSo I should have been able to go in and\nread that, right?\n\n164\n00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:37.460\nWell, no,\nI don't have read access to the folder.\n\n165\n00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.690\nI can't even get into the folder.\n\n166\n00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.590\nBetter yet see the files inside of it, so\n\n167\n00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.990\nI'm not able to read that file\nbecause the folder is stopping me.\n\n168\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:50.230\nNow, for most of us that's how that\nfolder works, it does what it needs and\n\n169\n00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.000\nwe've got it.\n\n170\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.650\nBut what if Ronnie wants\nto collaborate with me,\n\n171\n00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.080\nhe's like I've got this term paper and\nI'm working on it with Don.\n\n172\n00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.700\nSo I wanna put it somewhere where\nwe can both edit it, right.\n\n173\n00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.010\nWell, we could create a custom folder, but\nthere is one more folder I wanna show you.\n\n174\n00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.040\nWhen I browse into the users folder right,\n\n175\n00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.130\nthe users folder is where all this\nstuff is kind of hidden away at.\n\n176\n00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.820\nAnd when I browse into that user folder\n\n177\n00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:20.770\nthere's actually another\nfolder in there called shared.\n\n178\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.920\nAnd so\nif I browse into the Macintosh-HD and\n\n179\n00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.760\nI go into users there's rwong and dpezet\nmy two users account and then Shared.\n\n180\n00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.500\nThat folders a default folder created\n\n181\n00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.120\nthat allows us to share\ninformation between users.\n\n182\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.349\nAnd if we go and take a look at it,\nso if I go into slash users and\n\n183\n00:09:42.349 --> 00:09:48.824\ndo an ls dash l, I can see that shared\nfolder and look at these permissions.\n\n184\n00:09:48.824 --> 00:09:51.790\nRead, write and execute, read, write and\nexecute, read, write and t [LAUGH].\n\n185\n00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.630\nWhat the heck is that?\n\n186\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.930\nWell, what you have is\na really interesting folder.\n\n187\n00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.100\nThe shared folder is special.\n\n188\n00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.440\nIt's got read, write, and\nexecute basically for everybody.\n\n189\n00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.270\nEverybody can read, and\ncan write, and this is great for\n\n190\n00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.230\ncollaboration if you wanna share something\nwith somebody else on the computer.\n\n191\n00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.590\nBut wouldn't it stink if I\nshared something to Ronnie,\n\n192\n00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.170\nand then he went in there and\nhe just moved it to his own folder?\n\n193\n00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.870\nAnd it was gone and\nI no longer had access.\n\n194\n00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.970\nRight or maybe he just got mad one day and\ndeleted it all poor Ronnie has a temper.\n\n195\n00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.692\nSo I don't want that.\n\n196\n00:10:21.692 --> 00:10:25.260\nWell, this folder has a special\nattribute attached to it,\n\n197\n00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.390\nit's called the sticky bit.\n\n198\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.440\nThis t right here\nrepresents the sticky bit.\n\n199\n00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.530\nAnd it means that this folder does\nallow anybody to read from it,\n\n200\n00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.090\nand allows anybody to write to it.\n\n201\n00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.930\nAnd it allows anybody to basically\nput this information in here.\n\n202\n00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:48.110\nBut it doesn't allow you to\ndelete somebody else's files.\n\n203\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.150\nSo for example if Ronnie drops\na file in their, I may have read and\n\n204\n00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.280\nwrite access to it but I can't delete it,\nI can't move it out of there,\n\n205\n00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.290\nI can't change the permissions on it.\n\n206\n00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:03.580\nSo it's like a limited version\nof right permission, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.810\nI've got read in a certain level of right\nand I have to be able to collaborate and\n\n208\n00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.020\nwork with him on it.\n\n209\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.950\nOkay, that's special and\n\n210\n00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.900\nthat really goes beyond what our\nnormal permissions are like.\n\n211\n00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:20.810\nThat sticky bit is applied to the shared\nfolder, /user/shared by default.\n\n212\n00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.470\nSo if you wanna use it,\nyou can, it's there.\n\n213\n00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.150\nYou can apply the sticky bit to your\nown folder though, if you want,\n\n214\n00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.720\nif you want to create a folder like\nthis somewhere else you could.\n\n215\n00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.870\nTo do it,\n\n216\n00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.610\nyou got that do it from command line they\ndon't really give you a GUI to do it.\n\n217\n00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:40.348\nRemember that we were using the chmod\ncommand in the last episode change mode.\n\n218\n00:11:40.348 --> 00:11:45.197\nAnd I was using that to add read\npermissions or write permissions or\n\n219\n00:11:45.197 --> 00:11:50.060\nexecute, you can use chmod to\napply the sticky bit as well.\n\n220\n00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.640\nSo for example,\nRonnie might want to create a folder, and\n\n221\n00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.170\nI'll just make a folder called Sticky,\njust as an example.\n\n222\n00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:04.230\nOkay, and this folder, by default,\n\n223\n00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.660\nhas read, write, execute, read and\nexecute, read and execute.\n\n224\n00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.520\nSo Ronnie can do whatever he wants to it.\n\n225\n00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.760\nEverybody else can read from the folder,\nbut they can't write to it.\n\n226\n00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.420\nWell, I could say, chmod and\n\n227\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.630\nthen take group and other,\nand add write permission\n\n228\n00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:28.150\nto the sticky folder, and if it already\nhas contents in it then I'll probably want\n\n229\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:31.500\nto do a -R to make make that recursive,\nmines empty so I didn't need that.\n\n230\n00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.730\nBut just for real life land.\n\n231\n00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.400\nAnd if I take a look at\nthe permissions now.\n\n232\n00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.252\nNow the sticky folder has read,\nwrite and execute for everybody, okay.\n\n233\n00:12:39.252 --> 00:12:42.633\nBut if I leave it like this,\ntechnically, somebody could come in and\n\n234\n00:12:42.633 --> 00:12:46.659\ndelete stuff outta there, and mess with\nother people's files in a way that's not\n\n235\n00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:48.560\nnecessarily what I want, all right.\n\n236\n00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.700\nSo I can apply the sticky\nbit to stop that.\n\n237\n00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.240\nAnd then way we do that is\nwith chmod just like before.\n\n238\n00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.372\nAnd this time, we add +t.\n\n239\n00:12:57.372 --> 00:13:05.310\nWe're gonna add that t attribute to\nthe folder file, and then punch it in.\n\n240\n00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.790\nAnd you can do it to a file.\n\n241\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.170\nWe normally use it with a folder but\nyou can do it to a file if you want.\n\n242\n00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.505\nIf there's contents in the folder already,\nyou might need to do a -R.\n\n243\n00:13:13.505 --> 00:13:17.580\nI'm kinda beat that dead horse, but\nbasically, we need to get that applied.\n\n244\n00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.810\nAnd now it's gonna get it put in place.\n\n245\n00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:24.500\nAnd when I look at it, there's that sticky\nbit that's gonna make it where, yes,\n\n246\n00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.510\nmultiple people can put things in there,\nbut\n\n247\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:31.240\nit's gonna limit the ability of one\nuser to mess with another user's data.\n\n248\n00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.430\nThis is really handy for shared storage,\nwhere you've got many people that access\n\n249\n00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.950\nit an administrator can\noverride this very easy.\n\n250\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.820\nAnd we can even assign other permissions\nlike ACL permissions on top of it to grant\n\n251\n00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.260\npeople additional access.\n\n252\n00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:49.240\nBut as far as creating a safer little\nenvironment, this works out well.\n\n253\n00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.850\nUsers can only delete and\nrename their own data.\n\n254\n00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.790\nThey can't delete and\nrename other people's data.\n\n255\n00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:56.819\nSo it's kind of a safe zone.\n\n256\n00:13:58.628 --> 00:14:01.159\nAll right, so\nthat's basically the sticky bit,\n\n257\n00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:05.193\nkind of a weird limited use case scenario\nthing, but it does show up on the exam,\n\n258\n00:14:05.193 --> 00:14:08.104\nand it's something that you\nmight use in real life land.\n\n259\n00:14:08.104 --> 00:14:10.740\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, when we start\ndealing with these permissions.\n\n260\n00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.743\nI've also seen it on my own Macbook that\nI get a warning every once in awhile that\n\n261\n00:14:13.743 --> 00:14:15.534\ntells me that permissions\nhave been damaged.\n\n262\n00:14:15.534 --> 00:14:17.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What can I do about that?\n\n263\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, so it's easy for\nus to make our own mistakes, right?\n\n264\n00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.460\nYou can accidentally block\nyourself out of something, and\n\n265\n00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.105\nit might even be something important like\nthe library folder in your home directory.\n\n266\n00:14:27.105 --> 00:14:28.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is really important.\n\n267\n00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.200\nAll your application\npreferences are there, and\n\n268\n00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.290\nif you lock yourself out of\nthat it can make things break.\n\n269\n00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:33.190\nSoftware doesn't work right.\n\n270\n00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:37.470\nYou start to get error messages, but\nit can even happen inadvertently.\n\n271\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.320\nApplications can break it by accident or\nyour have a power outage and\n\n272\n00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.610\nthe system messes something up and\nyour permissions get damaged.\n\n273\n00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.080\nIt happens, right.\n\n274\n00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.780\nWell, fortunately,\nthere's an easy way for us to repair it.\n\n275\n00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.760\nIf your system can still boot up, right,\nif you're still able to log in and\n\n276\n00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.870\nat least get to a desktop,\nyou can use the Disk Utility to repair it.\n\n277\n00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.330\nWe saw the Disk Utility back in another\nepisode, let me switch back over to my\n\n278\n00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:01.226\nadministrator's account, because Ronnie is\njust a regular user on this computer so\n\n279\n00:15:01.226 --> 00:15:02.870\nhe won't be able to do everything.\n\n280\n00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.530\nBut if I switch back\nover to my admin account,\n\n281\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:10.760\nwe can fire up the Disk Utility so\nI'll just do spotlight and disk utility.\n\n282\n00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.740\nAnd you can choose your volume, right?\n\n283\n00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.730\nYou don't have to choose the whole disk.\n\n284\n00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:15.560\nThe physical disk.\n\n285\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.780\nYou just want to choose the logical volume\nso I might take my Macintosh HD and\n\n286\n00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.700\nyou can click on the First Aid button.\n\n287\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.320\nIn older versions of Mac OS\nyou had two different buttons.\n\n288\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.280\nOne that was there well it was\nactually four buttons because it was\n\n289\n00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.610\nverify permissions and fixed permissions.\n\n290\n00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.950\nAnd it was verified disk and fixed disk\nright, so one was looking for disk errors.\n\n291\n00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.920\nThe other one was looking for permissions.\n\n292\n00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.580\nStarting with I believe it was el capitan\nthey just combined it all in one button.\n\n293\n00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.190\nAnd why have four when you can have one?\n\n294\n00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.890\nAnd this button will check for physical\nerrors on the disk as well as permissions.\n\n295\n00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.126\nWell it really does permissions\nwhen you choose the volume.\n\n296\n00:15:49.126 --> 00:15:52.454\nWhen you choose the disk as a whole it's\nreally looking at the boot record and\n\n297\n00:15:52.454 --> 00:15:53.235\nsettings there.\n\n298\n00:15:53.235 --> 00:15:55.175\nNot so\nmuch the permissions inside of the volume.\n\n299\n00:15:55.175 --> 00:15:58.492\nSo I need to choose the volume\nthat I'm giving the error on.\n\n300\n00:15:58.492 --> 00:16:03.322\nAnd then from there I can hit First Aid,\nand it'll run a scan and look for errors.\n\n301\n00:16:03.322 --> 00:16:08.830\nAnd it's looking for physical errors\nas well as permissions, right?\n\n302\n00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.630\nNow, in my case I've\nchosen the boot volume.\n\n303\n00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.067\nAnd it's telling me that it's\ngonna temporarily lock it,\n\n304\n00:16:14.067 --> 00:16:16.662\nwhich is gonna cause some\napplications to freeze for a moment.\n\n305\n00:16:16.662 --> 00:16:19.768\nSo it's just telling me,\nhey most things will work fine, but\n\n306\n00:16:19.768 --> 00:16:22.890\nyou might have some problems and\njust wait a little bit.\n\n307\n00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.980\nIf I'd chosen one of my external volumes,\nI wouldn't have gotten this warning.\n\n308\n00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.190\nIt would have just gone and\ndone the verification to check.\n\n309\n00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.580\nBut we don't normally get\nthe problem on our removal.\n\n310\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.148\nNormally our system just does the problem.\n\n311\n00:16:33.148 --> 00:16:35.960\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit Continue, and let it do the scan.\n\n312\n00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.410\nAnd it's actually already unlocked and\nmoved on.\n\n313\n00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.170\nIt doesn't lock it very long.\n\n314\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.280\nSo now I can use my computer as normal.\n\n315\n00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.980\nBut it's scanning through the disk.\n\n316\n00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.920\nAnd you'll see in here somewhere,\nin all this mess,\n\n317\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.880\nwhere it's checking permissions.\n\n318\n00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.610\nAnd it basically scans through, and looks\nfor any of the default permissions that\n\n319\n00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.840\nmay have been tampered with, changed or\nbroken, in a way that affects the system.\n\n320\n00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.909\nAnd if it finds that, it will fix them.\n\n321\n00:16:58.909 --> 00:17:01.731\nIt will put the permissions back\nto the way they should be, and\n\n322\n00:17:01.731 --> 00:17:03.100\nthat's a quick way to fix it.\n\n323\n00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.920\nWhere you really get a problem though,\nis if your permissions are messed up so\n\n324\n00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.300\nbadly that you can't even log in, right?\n\n325\n00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.060\nIf the operating system is not able to\nfunction, now you've got a real problem.\n\n326\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.370\nSo what do you do there?\n\n327\n00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.950\nWell, you can try and boot to recovery,\nassuming your disk isn't totally hosed,\n\n328\n00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.498\nyou should be able to boot to recovery,\nright?\n\n329\n00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:24.430\nHold command R,\nwhile your system boots up.\n\n330\n00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:28.770\nOr hold the option key, and you'll get\nthe list of disks to boot from and\n\n331\n00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.210\nyou can pick your recovery partition.\n\n332\n00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.850\nHopefully that works.\n\n333\n00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.650\nIf that doesn't work, the next\nstep is probably the most extreme,\n\n334\n00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.600\nwhich is to boot into target mode.\n\n335\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.756\nI can take my laptop for example,\nand boot it in target mode, so\n\n336\n00:17:40.756 --> 00:17:42.480\nit becomes a very expensive\nexternal hard drive.\n\n337\n00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.857\nAnd then I could hook it\nup to Ronnie's laptop, and\n\n338\n00:17:44.857 --> 00:17:47.120\nhe would just see it as a hard drive.\n\n339\n00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.140\nAnd he could run the disk utility,\nand scan my laptop,\n\n340\n00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.600\nand fix the permissions that way.\n\n341\n00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.631\nThat way I won't even have to boot\nmy laptop, it's just basically,\n\n342\n00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:55.930\nan external hard drive.\n\n343\n00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.220\nAnd he can scan it and fix it.\n\n344\n00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.490\nSo those are a few different ways\nthat we can get in there to repair\n\n345\n00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.530\nthe permissions.\n\n346\n00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.670\nOr if you know what's wrong, you can\ndrop to the terminal, browse to wherever\n\n347\n00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:09.600\nthe problem is, and manually fix it\nusing chmod, to change mode if you want.\n\n348\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.990\nBut most of the time,\nwe don't know where the problem is.\n\n349\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.510\nOr there could be hundreds or\neven thousands of files,\n\n350\n00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.410\nthat have been affected.\n\n351\n00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.578\nSo it’s typically just\nfaster to run first aids.\n\n352\n00:18:17.578 --> 00:18:20.510\nThat’s normally gonna be the technique\nwe use to fix that one for us.\n\n353\n00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.240\nAll right, and we'll see mine's\nalready done, it scanned through.\n\n354\n00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.220\nAnd I doubt I had any problems on mine,\nbut\n\n355\n00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.320\nyou never know; we mess\nwith things enough.\n\n356\n00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.120\nOne thing worth mentioning,\nprobably not on the exam, but\n\n357\n00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:36.200\nI know on my laptop it’s an issue,\nis that I do have FileVault turned on.\n\n358\n00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.750\nAnd so, if I wanna boot to\nrecovery to run a Fix Permissions,\n\n359\n00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.040\nI'm gonna need to make sure\nthat I can unlock that disk.\n\n360\n00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.060\nYou need your password to do it.\n\n361\n00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.657\nIf I were to boot in Target Mode,\nand hook up to Ronnie's laptop,\n\n362\n00:18:46.657 --> 00:18:48.036\nit would see that I had FileVault.\n\n363\n00:18:48.036 --> 00:18:51.816\nAnd it would prompt him to\nauthenticate on that disk,\n\n364\n00:18:51.816 --> 00:18:54.850\nI would need my recovery key for that.\n\n365\n00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.310\nIt doesn't do the username and\npassword, it does the recovery key.\n\n366\n00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.200\nSo you gotta have that recovery key,\nfor when you turn File Vault on.\n\n367\n00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.940\nIf you don't have that, then you may\nnot be able to repair this at all.\n\n368\n00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.660\nAnd then, the way you fix it is\nby formatting your laptop, and\n\n369\n00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.290\nrestoring from Time Machine.\n\n370\n00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.320\nSo if you don't have a Time Machine\nbackup, then there isn't a way to fix it.\n\n371\n00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.593\nYou just format and\nnow you got a fresh, clean install, and\n\n372\n00:19:13.593 --> 00:19:14.878\nyou regret losing all your data.\n\n373\n00:19:14.878 --> 00:19:16.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you're sad.\n\n374\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.354\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don, let's take a little bit of time,\n\n375\n00:19:20.354 --> 00:19:25.085\nand also now take a look at permissions,\nand also the removable media here.\n\n376\n00:19:25.085 --> 00:19:27.721\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nremovable media is weird, right?\n\n377\n00:19:27.721 --> 00:19:29.667\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n378\n00:19:29.667 --> 00:19:31.210\n&gt;&gt; It's weird because a lot of times,\n\n379\n00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.042\nremovable media will get formatted\nin some filesystem other than\n\n380\n00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:35.860\nMac OS Extended Journaled.\n\n381\n00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.910\nAnd if you're trying to\nbe really compatible,\n\n382\n00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.260\nwith as many systems as possible,\nit'll normally be formatted FAT32.\n\n383\n00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.597\nSo if you go to the store right now, and\nbuy the first USB thumb drive you find.\n\n384\n00:19:45.597 --> 00:19:47.597\nIt doesn't matter how expensive or\nhow cheap it is,\n\n385\n00:19:47.597 --> 00:19:49.160\njust buy whatever one you find.\n\n386\n00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.839\nYou come back to your office,\nyou plug into your Mac, the odds are,\n\n387\n00:19:51.839 --> 00:19:53.067\nit will be formatted FAT32.\n\n388\n00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:56.943\nThe vendors know that if I want this\nto work on Windows, and Mac OS, and\n\n389\n00:19:56.943 --> 00:20:00.645\nLinux, we format it FAT32,\nthat works everywhere.\n\n390\n00:20:00.645 --> 00:20:02.210\nBut FAT32 kinda sucks.\n\n391\n00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.055\n[LAUGH] It doesn't\nsupport file permissions,\n\n392\n00:20:05.055 --> 00:20:08.545\nit doesn't support files over 4\ngigs in size, it's very fragile.\n\n393\n00:20:08.545 --> 00:20:10.155\nIf you improperly unmount it,\n\n394\n00:20:10.155 --> 00:20:13.070\njust yank the disk out,\nit gets file corruption really easy.\n\n395\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.750\nSo it's not a great file system.\n\n396\n00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.160\nSo we're normally going to\nimmediately format that disk,\n\n397\n00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.820\nto something that is useful.\n\n398\n00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.847\nIn a Windows world we'd format it NTFS,\n\n399\n00:20:20.847 --> 00:20:24.360\nin the Mac world we'd format\nit Mac OS Extended journaled.\n\n400\n00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.426\nThat makes it much more robust,\nit can handle larger files,\n\n401\n00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:27.976\nit's much more resilient to being ejected.\n\n402\n00:20:27.976 --> 00:20:32.450\nAll right, and more importantly,\nit can handle permissions.\n\n403\n00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:34.170\nFAT32 doesn't support permissions.\n\n404\n00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:38.363\nSo when I plug in a FAT32 system,\nor even ExFAT for that matter,\n\n405\n00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:39.900\nit has no permissions.\n\n406\n00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.660\nIf we look on my computer,\n\n407\n00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.501\nwhoops Let me clear out the disk\nutility here real quick.\n\n408\n00:20:45.501 --> 00:20:47.580\nGet rid of that.\n\n409\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.760\nI've got these four disks over here.\n\n410\n00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.660\nWhich are really just four\npartitions on a USB disk.\n\n411\n00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.880\nBut one of them is ExFAT and\none of them is FAT.\n\n412\n00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.780\nAnd if I do a little get\ninformation on these guys, right.\n\n413\n00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.640\nLet me just pull these up over here,\nwhere we can see it.\n\n414\n00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.408\nAll right, so\nI've got my ExFAT and my FAT, and\n\n415\n00:21:02.408 --> 00:21:06.090\nif I scroll down here to the bottom and\nlook at the permissions.\n\n416\n00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.150\nLook what it says.\n\n417\n00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:07.920\nYou have custom access.\n\n418\n00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:09.937\nWhat the heck does that mean?\n\n419\n00:21:09.937 --> 00:21:10.810\nDo I have read?\n\n420\n00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:11.390\nDo I have write?\n\n421\n00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:12.140\nDo I have execute?\n\n422\n00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:14.596\nCustom, that's it, right?\n\n423\n00:21:14.596 --> 00:21:18.053\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What it's trying to tell me,\n\n424\n00:21:18.053 --> 00:21:23.558\nin ambiguous terms here, is that there\nare no permissions in ExFAT and FAT.\n\n425\n00:21:23.558 --> 00:21:26.265\nThere are at least no permissions\nthat are honored, right?\n\n426\n00:21:26.265 --> 00:21:28.600\nThere are permissions that\nwould be completely ignored.\n\n427\n00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.590\nSo if I were to look at\nthis in the terminal, and\n\n428\n00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.754\nI wanna browse into the FAT folder for\nexample, and take a look.\n\n429\n00:21:35.754 --> 00:21:40.080\nWell, I guess there's nothing in there,\nis there?\n\n430\n00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.196\nSo that's gonna be\na little bit of a problem.\n\n431\n00:21:41.196 --> 00:21:45.077\n[LAUGH] Well here, let me just\ncreate a file in there, real quick.\n\n432\n00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:48.890\nThere we go.\n\n433\n00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.350\nAnd I take a look at the file,\nthere it is.\n\n434\n00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:55.430\nAnd it's showing permissions,\ndpezet staff, read, write, execute, right?\n\n435\n00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.330\nIt's showing permissions on that file.\n\n436\n00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:00.580\nBut if I start messing with\nthose permissions, right?\n\n437\n00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:07.300\nSo if I take group and other, and\nI remove write access for test.txt, right?\n\n438\n00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:13.520\nAnd I pull up a listing on it,\nit doesn't seem to like that very much.\n\n439\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.030\nThere we go.\n\n440\n00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.130\nIt accepted the command without error.\n\n441\n00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.620\nBut it didn't actually apply.\n\n442\n00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.440\nThe right permissions didn't get removed.\n\n443\n00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.530\nWhy not?\n\n444\n00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.790\nBecause they didn't exist\nin the first place, right?\n\n445\n00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.938\nIt's just giving me the default kind of\nview, of what permissions would look like.\n\n446\n00:22:29.938 --> 00:22:34.910\nFAT, FAT32, ExFAT,\nthey don't support permissions.\n\n447\n00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:36.810\nThat's one of the reasons\nwhy we don't wanna use it.\n\n448\n00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:40.520\nBut even file systems that do support\npermissions, have a bit of a problem.\n\n449\n00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.190\nLet me give you an example there.\n\n450\n00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:46.991\nI have another volume on here,\nwhich is Mac OS extended journaled, right.\n\n451\n00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:49.880\nSo this is my /volumes/extended.\n\n452\n00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.630\nSo this one's Mac OS extended journaled.\n\n453\n00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:59.420\nAnd if I touch a file like test.txt,\nwhoops, and I take a look at it.\n\n454\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.340\nIt's got read and write for me,\nand read for everybody else.\n\n455\n00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.920\nAnd I can change those permissions.\n\n456\n00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.240\nSo I'm gonna give myself execute, and\n\n457\n00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:14.260\nI'm gonna give group and other, write.\n\n458\n00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.550\nSo I'm giving some extra\npermissions to other people, right?\n\n459\n00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.557\nAnd once I do that, if I take a look,\nthe permissions applied.\n\n460\n00:23:21.557 --> 00:23:22.725\nAnd it worked, right?\n\n461\n00:23:22.725 --> 00:23:25.608\nBecause Mac OS Extended Journaled\nsupports permissions.\n\n462\n00:23:25.608 --> 00:23:28.687\nOkay, here's the problem though.\n\n463\n00:23:28.687 --> 00:23:32.280\nAnd at first glance you're thinking,\nwell there's no problem, this works great.\n\n464\n00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.120\nWell this is a USB drive.\n\n465\n00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.811\nSo I eject the disk and\nthen I give it to Ronnie.\n\n466\n00:23:36.811 --> 00:23:38.616\nAnd Ronnie's got a Mac,\nand so I say hey Ronnie,\n\n467\n00:23:38.616 --> 00:23:40.784\nplug this in take a look at\nthis test file, it's awesome.\n\n468\n00:23:40.784 --> 00:23:43.610\nAnd so he plugs it in.\n\n469\n00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.260\nHow do those permissions\nlook on his system?\n\n470\n00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.510\nWell, everyone is just everyone,\nthat's fine.\n\n471\n00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.799\nStaff, he's got a staff group,\nso that's great, right?\n\n472\n00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:55.312\nBut dpezet, does he have\na dpezet account on his laptop?\n\n473\n00:23:55.312 --> 00:23:56.167\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, do you?\n\n474\n00:23:56.167 --> 00:23:58.607\n[LAUGH] No, he doesn't, right?\n\n475\n00:23:58.607 --> 00:24:02.581\nSo that user,\nthat owner in this case means nothing.\n\n476\n00:24:02.581 --> 00:24:04.830\nWho's the owner, nobody.\n\n477\n00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.710\nAnd I left it at the staff group.\n\n478\n00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.140\nBut what if I had changed\nit to a different group?\n\n479\n00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.740\nI have that access bpf group\nthat I use for Wireshark.\n\n480\n00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.090\nIf he doesn't have that installed,\nhe doesn't have that group.\n\n481\n00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.010\nSo now the group doesn't match either.\n\n482\n00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:19.190\nAnd all that's left is everyone.\n\n483\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.880\nSo the permissions don't match.\n\n484\n00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.320\nAll right,\n\n485\n00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.340\neven if he did have dpezet account,\nthere might be another problem there.\n\n486\n00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.130\nWhen we look at a Unix\nuser we see a username.\n\n487\n00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.690\nBut that's not what Unix sees.\n\n488\n00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.390\nUnix sees a UID, a user id,\nit's a number, right?\n\n489\n00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:35.460\nIf you go to a command prompt,\nso, like here.\n\n490\n00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.938\nIf I run whoami, I see my name,\nmy name is dpezet.\n\n491\n00:24:37.938 --> 00:24:41.900\nGreat, right, but\nif you run the id command.\n\n492\n00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.450\nYou'll see all the Unix\ninformation about your account.\n\n493\n00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:49.876\nAnd I can see that my user ID is 501,\nright?\n\n494\n00:24:49.876 --> 00:24:53.570\nWell, that's because I'm the first user.\n\n495\n00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.590\nOn Macs, it starts numbering with 501.\n\n496\n00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.030\nAnd so\nif I create a second user like Ronnie.\n\n497\n00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.800\nWell, he'd be 502, and\nthen 503, and so on.\n\n498\n00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.590\nOn Ronnie's laptop,\nI'll bet that he's 501 on his, right?\n\n499\n00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:12.290\nSo when it sets the owner of this file,\nit said the owner of this file is uid-501.\n\n500\n00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.270\nAnd on my laptop it shows as dpezet.\n\n501\n00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.251\nBut if I move that hard drive over to\nRonnie's laptop and he plugs it in,\n\n502\n00:25:17.251 --> 00:25:18.455\nit says the owner is 501.\n\n503\n00:25:18.455 --> 00:25:21.590\nAnd 501 is him,\nit'll show the owner as rwong.\n\n504\n00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:25.100\nNow the owner is not being respected,\nright.\n\n505\n00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.650\nThe owner is somebody completely\ndifferent on the other side.\n\n506\n00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.520\nSo permissions on a removable\nmedia can't be trusted.\n\n507\n00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.850\nAnd a lot of times they\ncan just cause problems.\n\n508\n00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:38.980\nAnd so you'll actually see an option,\nnot on exFAT and FAT.\n\n509\n00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:44.780\nBut if I take my extended one,\nI'll pull up its information.\n\n510\n00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.838\nFirst off I see permissions,\nthat's a start, right?\n\n511\n00:25:47.838 --> 00:25:51.235\nBecause I didn't even see permissions\nin the minute ago on FAT and exFAT.\n\n512\n00:25:51.235 --> 00:25:56.330\nLet me get this unlocked, there we go.\n\n513\n00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.215\nSo I can see permissions and\nI can manipulate them.\n\n514\n00:25:58.215 --> 00:26:02.813\nAnd notice this little option kind of\nhidden away down here at the bottom.\n\n515\n00:26:02.813 --> 00:26:06.930\nWhich says ignore\nownership on this volume.\n\n516\n00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:10.880\nIn other words,\nI don't care who the user is, right?\n\n517\n00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.983\nBecause even if it says the owner is 501.\n\n518\n00:26:13.983 --> 00:26:17.051\nThat's 501 on some other system,\nnot necessarily on mine.\n\n519\n00:26:17.051 --> 00:26:19.340\nI'm just going to ignore that.\n\n520\n00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.100\nOkay, that option is not on by default.\n\n521\n00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.630\nSo by default it’s trying to\nrecognize who the owner is.\n\n522\n00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.710\nWell look who the owner is, system.\n\n523\n00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.854\nIt didn't even bother making the owner me.\n\n524\n00:26:30.854 --> 00:26:35.620\nBecause when you plug a removable\nmedia into a computer.\n\n525\n00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.203\nEvery user that's logged\nin as access to it.\n\n526\n00:26:38.203 --> 00:26:40.140\nCuz it physically\nattaches to the computer.\n\n527\n00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.290\nSo it attaches it to system,\nwhich is effectively a meaningless value\n\n528\n00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.520\nthat's not gonna be recognized\nby other systems anyway.\n\n529\n00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.990\nSo we can tell it let's just ignore that.\n\n530\n00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:52.690\nAnd when you choose to ignore ownership\non this volume, look what happened.\n\n531\n00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.770\nInstead of saying system\nnow it does say dpezet.\n\n532\n00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:57.895\nThat means that I can act as the owner,\n\n533\n00:26:57.895 --> 00:27:01.028\nregardless of whatever the owner\nvalue is on that disk.\n\n534\n00:27:01.028 --> 00:27:03.320\nAnd now I can work with\neverything that's on it.\n\n535\n00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.210\nOn removable media like this, you can't\nguarantee permissions are going to work.\n\n536\n00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.860\nSo if you're really worried about\nprotecting data on removable media.\n\n537\n00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.530\nPermissions are not the way to do it.\n\n538\n00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.900\nInstead you need to encrypt the disk.\n\n539\n00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.080\nIf the disk is encrypted, you can make\nsure that somebody can't just take\n\n540\n00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.640\nyour disk and plug it in and\naccess your data.\n\n541\n00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.680\nPermissions won't stop that, right?\n\n542\n00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.660\nBut if it's encrypted,\nthey take your disk, they plug it in.\n\n543\n00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.790\nAnd they can't access your\ndata unless you provide a key.\n\n544\n00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:33.334\nSo that's the main thing to remember with\nthis is that removable media permissions\n\n545\n00:27:33.334 --> 00:27:38.810\nare they're more like a, they're not\na rule, they're more like a suggestion.\n\n546\n00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:42.625\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And suggestions can be ignored.\n\n547\n00:27:42.625 --> 00:27:44.955\nAll right, I think that is about it.\n\n548\n00:27:44.955 --> 00:27:48.095\nDid I have anything else on this thing?\n\n549\n00:27:48.095 --> 00:27:49.485\nYeah, that's basically it.\n\n550\n00:27:49.485 --> 00:27:51.777\nJust know that when you chose\nto ignore the ownership.\n\n551\n00:27:51.777 --> 00:27:53.984\nYou are effectively killing off\nthe permissions on that disk.\n\n552\n00:27:53.984 --> 00:27:55.965\nAnd saying, I'm just going to ignore it,\nand then have access.\n\n553\n00:27:55.965 --> 00:27:57.565\nYou're already doing that on exFAT and\n\n554\n00:27:57.565 --> 00:27:59.385\nFAT because there aren't\npermissions there anyway.\n\n555\n00:27:59.385 --> 00:28:03.837\nSo this really just applies with\nMacOS Extended journaled formatted discs.\n\n556\n00:28:03.837 --> 00:28:05.585\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well,\nthank you again for\n\n557\n00:28:05.585 --> 00:28:09.730\nhelping us to see some of these basic\ndefault structures that we have in place.\n\n558\n00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.520\nWhen we have our home folder\nas well as that shared folder.\n\n559\n00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.380\nRemember that idea of the sticky\nbit that's gonna come in handy for\n\n560\n00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.580\nyou as you get ready for the exam as well.\n\n561\n00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.762\nDon also showed us this ability to be\nable to repair those different file\n\n562\n00:28:20.762 --> 00:28:21.460\npermissions.\n\n563\n00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.775\nAs well as look at the way that\nremovable media might play or\n\n564\n00:28:24.775 --> 00:28:29.140\nnot play well with your permissions\nthat you end up assigning there.\n\n565\n00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:33.405\nSo all these are good reminders for us as\nwe start to manipulate and start to change\n\n566\n00:28:33.405 --> 00:28:36.980\nup and help users to figure out what\nto do with the different files and\n\n567\n00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.759\nthe permissions that are there.\n\n568\n00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:41.410\nBut that's also a great place for\nus to sign off.\n\n569\n00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.290\nFor ITPro.TV I've been your host,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n570\n00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:45.180\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n571\n00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:49.086\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nApple Certified Support Professional

00:00:07.533\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.438\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:14.300\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.080\nYou're watching the Apple Certified\nSupport Professional for Mac OS Sierra.\n\n7\n00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.105\nI'm you host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:22.871\nAnd today, we'll be taking a look\nat managing different files.\n\n9\n00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:25.277\nAnd here to help us in studio is Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:25.277 --> 00:00:27.000\nDon, welcome back to the studios.\n\n11\n00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.600\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back Ronnie,\nand yep, this is kinda a neat one.\n\n12\n00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.030\nWe're gonna take a look at\nhow the file system works.\n\n13\n00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.770\nAnd we've actually got several episodes\nwe're gonna cover how the file\n\n14\n00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.270\nsystem works.\n\n15\n00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.970\nBut basically, in this episode,\n\n16\n00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.070\nI wanna focus on how we can manipulate\nthe files that our users work with.\n\n17\n00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.660\nAnd as a system administrator, I don't\nreally have to worry too much about this,\n\n18\n00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.960\nI just throw all my stuff in my own\nfolder and don't think about it.\n\n19\n00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.551\nBut for your regular rank and\nfile office worker,\n\n20\n00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:54.511\nhaving quick access to the files that\nthey need is really important to them.\n\n21\n00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:57.832\nAnd that's why we joke about it,\nRonnie you've probably seen this before,\n\n22\n00:00:57.832 --> 00:01:00.028\nyou walk up to somebody and\nlook at their desktop and\n\n23\n00:01:00.028 --> 00:01:02.553\nit is just littered with icons\nright there on the desktop.\n\n24\n00:01:02.553 --> 00:01:07.067\nAnd I would say that I'm like,\nthese things called folders, right?\n\n25\n00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:10.357\nYou can put these stuffs yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:10.357 --> 00:01:13.570\nAnd they say well no,\nI know everything and it's all right here.\n\n27\n00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.238\nAnd yes,\nI've got 50 icons on my desktop but\n\n28\n00:01:16.238 --> 00:01:21.060\neach one represents a very particular\nfunction of my day to day work process.\n\n29\n00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.410\nAnd for a typical office worker that\nis not just a silly thing that they do.\n\n30\n00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.470\nIt is an optimization,\nan efficiency of their work flow.\n\n31\n00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.130\nAnd it's how they do their work.\n\n32\n00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.320\nBoy do they get angry if you\nmess with that in any way.\n\n33\n00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.730\nSo you don't wanna touch it.\n\n34\n00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.298\nYou want to support that, you wanna help\nnurture them and make them more efficient,\n\n35\n00:01:41.298 --> 00:01:42.916\neven when they do ridiculous things.\n\n36\n00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:47.635\nSo in this episode, I wanna talk a little\nbit about the types of files that we work\n\n37\n00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:48.985\nwith inside of Mac OS.\n\n38\n00:01:48.985 --> 00:01:52.269\nAnd more importantly,\nways that we can create aliases and\n\n39\n00:01:52.269 --> 00:01:55.829\nlinks to make it faster for\nus to get to those files to work with.\n\n40\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.380\nAll right, now where I want to get\nstarted here is going to be with aliases.\n\n41\n00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.510\nAliases are a very, very old technology.\n\n42\n00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.470\nIt's been around since\nthe original Mac OS days, right?\n\n43\n00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.710\nSo, back when we had PowerPC\nprocessors and the original Mac OS,\n\n44\n00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.710\nI know I started with Mac OS 7.6,\nI think, somewhere around there.\n\n45\n00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.180\nAnd with Mac OS 7,\nyou had where you could create aliases.\n\n46\n00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.830\nAnd then it was there in 8 and 9 and when\nthey switched to Intel processors, and\n\n47\n00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.970\nMacOS 10, we still have aliases and\n\n48\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.120\nall the way to today,\nbeen around over 20 years.\n\n49\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.320\nAliases are a really neat technology for\ncreating a link to a file somewhere else.\n\n50\n00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.860\nNow, there's a few different\nways we can do it.\n\n51\n00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.795\nThis is probably the easiest one, and\nit's supported by right by the OS.\n\n52\n00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:39.920\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n53\n00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.500\nOn my desktop,\nI've got a folder here called Examples.\n\n54\n00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.910\nAnd in the Examples folder, I've got\na couple of different files here and\n\n55\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.564\neach file is something different.\n\n56\n00:02:47.564 --> 00:02:51.107\nI've got a couple of archives and\nhere are my Show Notes for\n\n57\n00:02:51.107 --> 00:02:53.652\nthis episode that we're filming today.\n\n58\n00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:57.092\nSo before every show I prepare a few\nnotes and these are my notes for it, and\n\n59\n00:02:57.092 --> 00:02:59.760\nit's just a little mark down\nfile sitting right here.\n\n60\n00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.196\nNow in reality, I don't normally\nkeep my notes here on my desktop.\n\n61\n00:03:04.196 --> 00:03:08.794\nI have a folder called show notes and I\nhave all the different shows in there and\n\n62\n00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:13.249\nI can go in and find acsp1012 and\ngo in there and then I can find the actual\n\n63\n00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:17.678\nshow and I can hunt and find it and\nI can pull up what I'm looking for right?\n\n64\n00:03:17.678 --> 00:03:20.540\nBut it's a lot of steps to go through.\n\n65\n00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.700\nSo if I know I'm gonna be\nfilming that show today, or\n\n66\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.500\nif I'm gonna be working with\nthose shows right away.\n\n67\n00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.627\nI'll create an alias so I can get to this\nlocation much more quickly than having to\n\n68\n00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:31.791\nnavigate through it.\n\n69\n00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:36.537\nI mean if you look at my kind of history\nbar here, how to actually get to it,\n\n70\n00:03:36.537 --> 00:03:40.380\nit's gotta browse through my hard drive,\nmy user folder.\n\n71\n00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.734\nAnd then from my user folder into my\nDropbox folder into ITProTV center share\n\n72\n00:03:44.734 --> 00:03:45.764\ninto show notes.\n\n73\n00:03:45.764 --> 00:03:49.596\nIt's like six folders deep\nhere to get to those things.\n\n74\n00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:52.045\nSo that takes time to go in and find it.\n\n75\n00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:55.119\nAnd if I'm normally working with a lot,\nI could take that file.\n\n76\n00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:57.213\nAnd if you CTRL+CLICK or\n\n77\n00:03:57.213 --> 00:04:03.310\nif you have a right mouse button\nRIGHT-CLICK on it and pull up a menu.\n\n78\n00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.170\nYou'll see we've got\nthe option to make an alias.\n\n79\n00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.772\nYou can also do COMMAND + L\nthat will do the alias as well.\n\n80\n00:04:08.772 --> 00:04:13.206\nAnd when I make an alias it's basically\ncreating a link that points to\n\n81\n00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:14.588\nthat file all right.\n\n82\n00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:17.088\nNow, this one is actually stored\nin some special storage so\n\n83\n00:04:17.088 --> 00:04:20.442\nI'm gonna use the one that's here on\nmy desktop when I go into examples.\n\n84\n00:04:20.442 --> 00:04:24.073\nHere's that show note example and\nI'm gonna choose to make an alias.\n\n85\n00:04:24.073 --> 00:04:28.323\nNow it makes the alias right here in the\nsame folder, and so I'm gonna take it and\n\n86\n00:04:28.323 --> 00:04:31.571\njust drag it out here onto my desktop,\nso that's out there.\n\n87\n00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:35.777\nAnd so now I've got this alias\nsitting right here on my desktop.\n\n88\n00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:40.780\nNow, it did rename it a little bit,\nit added the word alias to the end.\n\n89\n00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.120\nBut I don't have to leave that there\nI can get rid of the word alias.\n\n90\n00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.370\nSo let me just delete that out.\n\n91\n00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.070\nAnd now,\nit's got the same name as my other file.\n\n92\n00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.670\nIt's got the same icon, the same name,\nit effectively looks the same.\n\n93\n00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.980\nI wouldn't even know it was\na link if it weren't for\n\n94\n00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.570\nthis little, whoops, my zoom going crazy\nthere, a little black arrow right there.\n\n95\n00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.370\nThat's how I know it's a link,\nthat's how I know it's an alias, right?\n\n96\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.510\nOtherwise it will look just\nlike the actual file itself.\n\n97\n00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.895\nIf I select it into a get info, right?\n\n98\n00:05:09.895 --> 00:05:14.098\nLike a Cmd + I or right click and\nchoose get Info, I'll see the file and\n\n99\n00:05:14.098 --> 00:05:16.246\nit shows as a kind, Alias, right?\n\n100\n00:05:16.246 --> 00:05:19.767\nAnd it's only 920 bytes,\nit's pretty small.\n\n101\n00:05:19.767 --> 00:05:24.367\nIf I take a look at the original file,\nso here, I'll pull up the original file,\n\n102\n00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:25.819\nI'll do the same thing.\n\n103\n00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:32.570\nAnd when I look at the original file,\nit is 1,824 bytes, okay.\n\n104\n00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.135\nIt is twice the size.\n\n105\n00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:36.421\nNow, it just happen to be twice the size,\nthat's not a normal thing.\n\n106\n00:05:36.421 --> 00:05:39.561\nLinks, really regardless\nof what they point to,\n\n107\n00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:42.190\nare usually less than a kilobyte in size.\n\n108\n00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.020\nUsually less than 1000 bytes.\n\n109\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.900\nSome can be larger, some can be smaller,\ndepends on the type of item we're linking,\n\n110\n00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.062\nbut they're usually very small.\n\n111\n00:05:48.062 --> 00:05:53.390\nThe thing that they point to, could be\nseveral gigs, or a terabyte in size.\n\n112\n00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.701\nThe link is very small, the alias,\n\n113\n00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:57.172\ncuz it's really just a pointer to\nwhere that original content is.\n\n114\n00:05:57.172 --> 00:06:03.670\nNow, if it's just a pointer, Why is it\nsometimes bigger and sometimes smaller?\n\n115\n00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.608\nWell the reason is an Alias is special.\n\n116\n00:06:05.608 --> 00:06:11.051\nIt's not just a one-time pointer that\nwas created, and now it's done, right?\n\n117\n00:06:11.051 --> 00:06:15.720\nIt's actually tracking\nthe original object.\n\n118\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.730\nCuz if I move the original object,\nwhat happens to the Alias, does it break?\n\n119\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.165\nNo, part of MacOS is that\nit tracks this aliases.\n\n120\n00:06:24.165 --> 00:06:26.816\nSo right now if I look at the alias,\n\n121\n00:06:26.816 --> 00:06:32.217\nsee that says the original :\n/Users/dpezet/Desktop/Example.\n\n122\n00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:34.273\nThats where the original file is.\n\n123\n00:06:34.273 --> 00:06:36.981\nWhat if I move it, right?\n\n124\n00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:41.020\nSo I'm gonna get out this let\nme go into my examples folder.\n\n125\n00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.723\nHere's where the original file\nis that I just linked to.\n\n126\n00:06:42.723 --> 00:06:47.860\nI'm gonna drag that and drop that into\nmy little podcast folder over here.\n\n127\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.080\nSo I'll just drag it and\ndrop it and now it's gone.\n\n128\n00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.276\nIt's not in this folder anymore, okay.\n\n129\n00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:53.252\nSo what happened to my alias?\n\n130\n00:06:53.252 --> 00:06:57.220\nMy alias was expecting\nthe file to be right here.\n\n131\n00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:57.870\nBut, it's not there anymore, is it?\n\n132\n00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.894\nWell, if I get info on that file and\ntake a look at it,\n\n133\n00:07:01.894 --> 00:07:07.573\nit shows the original as being in\n/users/dpezet/Desktop/Podcast.\n\n134\n00:07:07.573 --> 00:07:13.071\nI didn't even go and update the alias\nthe operating system did it for me.\n\n135\n00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:17.464\nThe aliases track the location\nof the original object.\n\n136\n00:07:17.464 --> 00:07:19.974\nAnd that's the real power of an alias.\n\n137\n00:07:19.974 --> 00:07:23.452\nI can create an alias and point it to\na file, and it's like that rotisserie\n\n138\n00:07:23.452 --> 00:07:26.383\nchicken commercial, you can set it and\nforget it that's it.\n\n139\n00:07:26.383 --> 00:07:28.764\nIt's in place, and\nit's done now we're getting you sued.\n\n140\n00:07:28.764 --> 00:07:31.140\nBut, [LAUGH] It's done.\n\n141\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.670\nAnd I don't have to\nworry about it anymore.\n\n142\n00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.840\nSo aliases are very powerful,\nand they're super easy to create.\n\n143\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.031\nAll you do is right click on item and\nchoose, Make Alias.\n\n144\n00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:44.850\nI did it here for\na file I can do it for a folder, too.\n\n145\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.440\nSo for example, my show notes folder,\n\n146\n00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.280\nI might know that I'm gonna be going\ninto that, or this ACSP 10, 12, 4.\n\n147\n00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.420\nI might know that I'm going\ninto it all the time.\n\n148\n00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.898\nSo I might choose to make an alias,\nand then drag that and\n\n149\n00:07:55.898 --> 00:08:00.190\ndrop it onto my desktop, and Again,\nI can leave the word alias on it or\n\n150\n00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.939\nI can take the word off\nif I don't like that.\n\n151\n00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:05.450\nThe name of the alias\ndoesn't actually matter.\n\n152\n00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.760\nWe can call it Bob, and\nit will still link back.\n\n153\n00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.270\nAnd so now,\n\n154\n00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:13.700\nI've got that shortcut right here on\nthe desktop tool folder instead of a file.\n\n155\n00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.830\nAnd when I double-click on it, it takes me\nright in to my show notes for this series.\n\n156\n00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.830\nAnd when I take that file, if I\ndouble-click on that, it opens it up, and\n\n157\n00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:23.630\nthere's my notes, right?\n\n158\n00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.044\nAnd there's the things that\nwe're gonna talk about, or\n\n159\n00:08:25.044 --> 00:08:26.530\nthings that we're talking about right now.\n\n160\n00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.960\nSo, that's the way that an alias works.\n\n161\n00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.150\nAnd it's part of macOS, it's very\neffective, very easy to work with.\n\n162\n00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.690\nAnd the key thing to remember\nis that behind the scenes\n\n163\n00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.490\nit's doing a lot more than just\nshowing you where the destination is.\n\n164\n00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:43.020\nIt's actually tracking that destination so\nit handles, if it gets moved or relocated,\n\n165\n00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.700\nor even renamed, it'll understand that,\nand will still point to it.\n\n166\n00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.660\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don, that actually sounds\nlike really neat technology.\n\n167\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.780\nBut I believe that in an earlier episode,\n\n168\n00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.590\nyou talked about the very fact\nthat it's BSD under the hood.\n\n169\n00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.470\nAnd there are links in BSD as well.\n\n170\n00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.020\nWill those still work inside of Mac OS?\n\n171\n00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:00.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you bring that up, Ronnie,\n\n172\n00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.530\ncuz there is a lot of confusion on this,\nright?\n\n173\n00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.880\nUnder the hood MacOS is running BSD Unix.\n\n174\n00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.850\nAnd in the Unix world, we've had links for\na long, long time, right?\n\n175\n00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:14.390\nSince the 1970s, so even longer than\nthe aliases has been available on MacOS.\n\n176\n00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:18.530\nSo, those links are very similar to\nthe aliases that I've just showed you.\n\n177\n00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.930\nThe primary difference is how they work.\n\n178\n00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.850\nThese things work\na little bit differently.\n\n179\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.270\nIn the UNIX world,\nwhat you have is a little command.\n\n180\n00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.160\nAnd the command is the ln command.\n\n181\n00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.760\nSo if I drop to a terminal, I can just\ntype ln, and that's short for link.\n\n182\n00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.210\nAnd when I run that,\nI can get the syntax for it.\n\n183\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.385\nWhat it does is ask me to specify a source\nfile, so where I'm getting my data from,\n\n184\n00:09:39.385 --> 00:09:43.030\nand then a target, which is the link\nthat I'm going to create, right?\n\n185\n00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.872\nSo that target, this might be a file,\nit might be a directory, and so\n\n186\n00:09:45.872 --> 00:09:47.750\nit's basically creating that link.\n\n187\n00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.720\nSo far, it sound it sounds like an alias.\n\n188\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.793\nIt's harder to do, right?\n\n189\n00:09:50.793 --> 00:09:53.560\n[LAUGH] But am alias,\nI right-click on it and choose make alias.\n\n190\n00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.682\nHere, I've gotta use this\ncommand line utility for it.\n\n191\n00:09:55.682 --> 00:09:58.830\nNow, I might still need to\ndo that in today's day and\n\n192\n00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.500\nage if I'm trying to script and\nautomate something, right?\n\n193\n00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.240\nAnd you can use automator to\ncreate aliases if you want,\n\n194\n00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.890\nbut if I'm something in a UNIX type\nscript it's usually easier to work\n\n195\n00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.930\nwith a UNIX type link to\nbe able to create this.\n\n196\n00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.116\nThe challenge you'll bump into\nhere is that the GUI MacOS,\n\n197\n00:10:14.116 --> 00:10:17.770\nit will recognize as UNIX links and\nit will follow them.\n\n198\n00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.650\nBut it won't let you create them.\n\n199\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.990\nSo, for your average end user, they're not\ngoing to be creating these UNIX links.\n\n200\n00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.806\nBut for an administrator, we may.\n\n201\n00:10:24.806 --> 00:10:27.200\nWe may need to create them for\nvarious reasons.\n\n202\n00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.220\nAnd when you go to create them,\n\n203\n00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.470\nbe aware that there's two\ndifferent types of UNIX links.\n\n204\n00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.380\nThere's hard links, and symbolic links.\n\n205\n00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.050\nNow, normally we work with symbolic links.\n\n206\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.990\nA symbolic link is similar to\nwhat we saw with the alias where\n\n207\n00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.830\nit's a link that points to a path.\n\n208\n00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.640\nSo, we define a path to a source, where\nwe're gonna be getting our information\n\n209\n00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.260\nfrom, and it creates a link for that.\n\n210\n00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.040\nSo, for example, if I wanted to create\na symbolic link, I would come in and\n\n211\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.470\nsay ln dash, or actually,\nwhere am I right now?\n\n212\n00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.650\nLet me get into my desktop.\n\n213\n00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.800\nSo, I'm gonna get into my desktop.\n\n214\n00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.870\nSo I am in /users/dpezet/Desktop.\n\n215\n00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.100\nAnd I'll do ln -s.\n\n216\n00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.790\nThat's telling it to do a symbolically.\n\n217\n00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.960\nIt actually default to a hard link,\nwhich I'll talk about in a minute, so\n\n218\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.130\nif I just do ln it's hard link,\nln -s it's symbolic.\n\n219\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.920\nAnother things is you'll hear some\npeople refer to these as soft links.\n\n220\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.290\nOn the Internet you'll hear people refer\nto them in both ways, even some textbooks.\n\n221\n00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.370\nBut the official name is a symbolic link.\n\n222\n00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.370\nSo we want to make sure we\nget that terminology right.\n\n223\n00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.260\nBut ln -s will create that symbolic link.\n\n224\n00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.000\nAnd then I tell it the source.\n\n225\n00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.390\nWell, the source for\nme is going to be my show note,\n\n226\n00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.250\nwhich I moved away a moment ago.\n\n227\n00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.309\ni moved it into the Podcast folder, and\n\n228\n00:11:39.309 --> 00:11:44.791\nthen it was this guy right here,\nthat nice big long file name, right?\n\n229\n00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:46.980\nAnd then I need to give it a target.\n\n230\n00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.660\nWhere am I gonna link it to?\n\n231\n00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.740\nAnd I'm gonna link it to my desktop.\n\n232\n00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.080\nAnd when I do that,\n\n233\n00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.060\nI'm just gonna call it like notes.txt or\nnotes.md or whatever I want.\n\n234\n00:11:59.060 --> 00:11:59.950\nThe name doesn't have to match.\n\n235\n00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.640\nYou can call it whatever you want and it\ncan link back to a file with another name.\n\n236\n00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.550\nIt's basically creating\nan entry that has a little\n\n237\n00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.310\npointer that points to\nthis other destination.\n\n238\n00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:13.860\nSo this is my source,\nwhere the data is coming from, and\n\n239\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:19.030\nthis is the actual link that I'm creating,\nthat I'll be able to browse to.\n\n240\n00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.090\nAnd when I run that, it's gonna create it.\n\n241\n00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:26.420\nNow, the GUI will recognize this link,\nit will see it and allow me to follow it.\n\n242\n00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.010\nBut be aware when you mess with\nthe file system from the Terminal,\n\n243\n00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.050\nthe GUI doesn't always\nrecognize it right away.\n\n244\n00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.562\nThat's why I was kinda stalling there for\na minute, for it to recognize it.\n\n245\n00:12:34.562 --> 00:12:37.690\n[LAUGH] But I can see I do see I have\nnotes.md right there on my desktop now.\n\n246\n00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:42.010\nAnd when I look at that notes.md,\nsee how it's got the little black arrow?\n\n247\n00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:45.140\nKinda hard to see, but\nit is there, just like an alias.\n\n248\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.706\nSo visually, looking at that,\nit looks just like an alias.\n\n249\n00:12:49.706 --> 00:12:54.470\nAnd if I do a get info on it, and\nI come over here, it shows kind alias.\n\n250\n00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.480\nActually it says it's an alias.\n\n251\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.760\nBut it isn't, right?\n\n252\n00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.910\nIt's a symbolic link created in the UNIX\nworld, and there's the pointer.\n\n253\n00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.645\nSo everything looks good so far, right?\n\n254\n00:13:02.645 --> 00:13:08.246\nWhere things start to breakdown, though,\nis what happens if I move the original?\n\n255\n00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:10.666\nIf I take that original\nthat I just linked to and\n\n256\n00:13:10.666 --> 00:13:13.720\nI move it back to the examples\nfolder where it was, right?\n\n257\n00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.480\nSo I just moved it.\n\n258\n00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:20.140\nAnd then I comeback here and\nI take that link and I take a look at it.\n\n259\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.620\nWell, now it's broken.\n\n260\n00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.731\nSee how the original is showing\n/Users/dpezet/Desktop/notes.md?\n\n261\n00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:29.870\nNotes.md doesn't actually exist.\n\n262\n00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.630\nThat was a pointer.\n\n263\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.940\nAnd I can see that a little\nbetter in the file system.\n\n264\n00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:42.462\nIf I look in the file system here,\nI can still see where Notes.md is a link.\n\n265\n00:13:42.462 --> 00:13:48.326\nIt's got that little arrow on it, and\nit's pointing to /Users/dpezet/Desktop.\n\n266\n00:13:48.326 --> 00:13:50.678\nAnd then it kinda scrolls\nof the edge there for me.\n\n267\n00:13:50.678 --> 00:13:56.145\n/Desktop, actually, it's not gonna\nshow me the whole thing, is it?\n\n268\n00:13:56.145 --> 00:13:57.700\nCome on, there we go.\n\n269\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.780\n/Podcast/apple.\n\n270\n00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.510\nIt's still looking to the Podcast folder.\n\n271\n00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.190\nIt's pointing to the wrong place.\n\n272\n00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:10.180\nSo, symbolic links don't track\nthe original file, the source file.\n\n273\n00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.620\nThey don't survive\nhaving the source moved.\n\n274\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.570\nThat's a bit of a problem, right?\n\n275\n00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.260\nAliases do.\n\n276\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:16.980\nSymbolic links don't.\n\n277\n00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.500\nAnd then there's hard links.\n\n278\n00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.550\nHard links are a little more interesting.\n\n279\n00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:26.690\nThe command is the same, except instead\nof doing a -s I leave that off, right.\n\n280\n00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:30.930\nAnd so, I can come through and\nsay ln, and then the source,\n\n281\n00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:35.090\nwhere the data is coming from, followed by\nthe link name that I'm creating, right?\n\n282\n00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.910\nAnd that'll create a link there, too.\n\n283\n00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:41.180\nThe difference here is that a hard\nlink isn't creating a shortcut.\n\n284\n00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.730\nWhat it's doing is it's\ncreating a second file name.\n\n285\n00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.560\nWhen you create a file,\nit's got two pieces.\n\n286\n00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.430\nIt's got all its data, and\nthen it's got its file name.\n\n287\n00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.530\nThe data is stored,\nthrown out on the hard drive.\n\n288\n00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:56.470\nBut the file name is stored\nin the file system table.\n\n289\n00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:01.120\nWhat a hard link is is a second file name\nin the table that points to the same data.\n\n290\n00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.280\nAnd by doing this, you can delete\nthe original file, and it just deletes\n\n291\n00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.630\nthe file name but the data is still there,\nthe second file name still works.\n\n292\n00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.650\nThe file won't actually go away\nuntil I get rid of all of the hard\n\n293\n00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.290\nlinks that point to it.\n\n294\n00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.200\nNow, hard links sound like a great idea,\nright?\n\n295\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.260\nI got multiple names,\n\n296\n00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.080\nthey all point to the same file, you can\nmove the original and it's not a big deal.\n\n297\n00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.610\nHard links sounds great.\n\n298\n00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.941\nBut hard links only work when the link and\nthe file are on the same volume,\n\n299\n00:15:27.941 --> 00:15:29.860\non the same hard drive, right?\n\n300\n00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.974\nIf they're on different places,\nlike one's on the network share or\n\n301\n00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:36.626\none's on another hard drive or even a\nseparate partition on the same hard drive,\n\n302\n00:15:36.626 --> 00:15:38.200\nhard links don't work, right?\n\n303\n00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.330\nHard links break down for that.\n\n304\n00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.250\nHard links also don't\nwork well with folders.\n\n305\n00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.220\nSymbolic links do, cuz they just point\nto a path, but hard links don't.\n\n306\n00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.540\nHard links are expecting to point to file\ndata, and folders don't have file data.\n\n307\n00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.564\nFolders only exist in\nthe file system table, so\n\n308\n00:15:50.564 --> 00:15:52.295\nyou can't create a hard link for those.\n\n309\n00:15:52.295 --> 00:15:55.890\nSo, hard links are far less\nflexible than a symbolic link.\n\n310\n00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.478\nEven though they sound great, cuz they\nsurvive the original file being deleted or\n\n311\n00:15:59.478 --> 00:16:01.714\nrenamed or moved,\nThey're not very flexible, so\n\n312\n00:16:01.714 --> 00:16:03.281\nwe don't get to use them very much.\n\n313\n00:16:03.281 --> 00:16:06.520\nAlias kinda overcome that.\n\n314\n00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.750\n&gt;&gt; So Don, with the choices that we have,\nwhether we're talking about aliases or\n\n315\n00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.950\nlinks, when do we know\nwhen to use which one?\n\n316\n00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:17.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, so 99 times out of 100\nyou're going to use an alias, right?\n\n317\n00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.120\nThe Mac aliases are the way to go.\n\n318\n00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.050\nThe only time that I ever\nmove away from that and\n\n319\n00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.850\nuse links anymore is if I'm\ndoing scripting in automation.\n\n320\n00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.180\nAnd if you're automating\nwith the automator,\n\n321\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.970\nit can actually use the Mac aliases, too.\n\n322\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.030\nSo if, again, you wanna go that route.\n\n323\n00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.180\nBut if you're doing bash scripts and\nthings like that from the Unix command\n\n324\n00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.150\nline, if you're working in a Unixy kind\nof way, you'll want to use links, but for\n\n325\n00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.360\nthe most part you're going to\nuse aliases whenever you can.\n\n326\n00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.100\nIt also integrates a little better\nwith Spotlight, and for the search\n\n327\n00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.270\nfunctionality, and even the new Siri\nfunctionality kind of benefits from it.\n\n328\n00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.150\nVersus the Unix links,\nwhich can cause confusion sometimes.\n\n329\n00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.050\nIt can actually make it look like you've\ngot duplicate files when you don't.\n\n330\n00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.970\nSo it's usually better to\ngo with a Mac aliases.\n\n331\n00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.820\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don,\nwhen we were talking about links,\n\n332\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.370\nyou showed us how to link\nit to a particular file.\n\n333\n00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.550\nBut, there are some times where\nwe actually run into things,\n\n334\n00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.860\nlike applications.\n\n335\n00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.350\nWill links work for applications too?\n\n336\n00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:09.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n337\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.064\nApplications are a little\nbit special though, right?\n\n338\n00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:17.183\nI link to a file, and a file like this\nmarkdown file is just a text file, right?\n\n339\n00:17:17.183 --> 00:17:20.560\nAn application isn't just a file.\n\n340\n00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.670\nI know it looks like it, right?\n\n341\n00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.520\nIf I browse into Macintosh HD, and\n\n342\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.880\nI go into Applications,\nhere's all these applications, right?\n\n343\n00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.580\nSo if I take Marked, for example,.\n\n344\n00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.810\nMarked's a little mark\ndown viewer that I use.\n\n345\n00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.280\nAnd if I take it,\n\n346\n00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.520\nit looks like it's just a single\nfile inside of this folder, right?\n\n347\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.810\nI could take it, and drag it and drop it\nsomewhere else, and it would still work,\n\n348\n00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:42.970\nit looks like a single file.\n\n349\n00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.930\nBut in reality,\nit's actually what's called a bundle.\n\n350\n00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.730\nAnd a bundle, in reality,\nis actually a folder.\n\n351\n00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.890\nSo it's got a fancy name, but at the end\nof the day, it is just a folder.\n\n352\n00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:57.450\nIf I were to drop to my terminal,\nand go into /Applications and\n\n353\n00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.768\nlook for that Marked file.\n\n354\n00:18:01.768 --> 00:18:04.550\nWell, here we'll just find\nit the old fashioned way.\n\n355\n00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.470\nThere, there's Marked.\n\n356\n00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.570\nNotice that it's Marked 2.app, right?\n\n357\n00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.730\nIt actually does have a file extension of\n.app, but it's not a file, it's a folder.\n\n358\n00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.420\nSo that extension is really just kind of\na placeholder there to let the operating\n\n359\n00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.540\nsystem know, don't show this as a folder,\n\n360\n00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.590\ndon't let people browse into\nit to see the contents.\n\n361\n00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:25.040\nInstead, just show an icon\nthat's stored inside of it.\n\n362\n00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.360\nBut from the file system,\nyou can actually browse into it.\n\n363\n00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.150\nAnd start to browse and\nsee what's in there.\n\n364\n00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.390\nAnd eventually like\nthe icon is stored in here.\n\n365\n00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.615\nI think it's at the resources folder,\nif I remember right.\n\n366\n00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.620\nSomewhere in here we'll find the icon.\n\n367\n00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.670\nBut you'll find other things.\n\n368\n00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:45.910\nThis is the actual application\ntucked away inside of here, right?\n\n369\n00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.570\nHere's the actual application, this guy.\n\n370\n00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:53.420\nSo here is Marked 2, and you'll see it's\ngot execute permissions attached to it.\n\n371\n00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.450\nThat's the actual application.\n\n372\n00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.910\nBut when you create an alias, you're\ncreating alias technically to the folder.\n\n373\n00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.052\nAnd Mac OS understands that,\nit knows that that's the application.\n\n374\n00:19:02.052 --> 00:19:04.043\nYou can see some of this from the GUI too.\n\n375\n00:19:04.043 --> 00:19:09.022\nIf I go back to here, if you Cotrl + click\nor right click if you can on Marked 2 or\n\n376\n00:19:09.022 --> 00:19:13.700\nwhatever application you wanna look at,\nthey're all the same.\n\n377\n00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:18.360\nYou've got Open and right beneath Open,\nyou've got Show Package Contents.\n\n378\n00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.480\nAnd what Show Package Contents does is\nit says, let's treat that like a folder.\n\n379\n00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.270\nAnd now I can browse in it, and\n\n380\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.680\nhere's the contents to that application so\nI can see it.\n\n381\n00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.470\nSo when you create an alias\nto an application,\n\n382\n00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.370\nyou're actually creating an alias\nto a folder, but that's okay,\n\n383\n00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.940\nbecause the operating system knows,\nthis isn't just a normal folder.\n\n384\n00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.210\nIt ends in .app, and so\nit's an application and\n\n385\n00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.280\nso when I double click on that alias,\ninstead of browsing into the folder,\n\n386\n00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.020\nwe need to launch the app and\nit knows that and it'll do it properly.\n\n387\n00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.280\n&gt;&gt; Don, we may actually also\nhave different other types of\n\n388\n00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.180\nfiles on our system as well.\n\n389\n00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.110\nIs everything one pretty\nmuch the same way?\n\n390\n00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.497\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much, the exception, and\nyou wouldn't use links with these, but\n\n391\n00:19:54.497 --> 00:19:56.670\nthe exception would be package files,\nright?\n\n392\n00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.020\nUsually applications come as a .app and\nyou'd drag and\n\n393\n00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.920\ndrop them into the applications folder,\nthat's how they install,\n\n394\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.478\nwe'll talk more about them,\nI think, in the next episode.\n\n395\n00:20:04.478 --> 00:20:08.850\nBut you will occasionally get pkg files,\nand pkgs are packages.\n\n396\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.350\nThis is normally system software,\nlike drivers.\n\n397\n00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:15.610\nIf you get a driver,\nyou need to install it in the system and\n\n398\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.120\nit's not installing in /Applications.\n\n399\n00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.490\nIn fact, it's normally installing in\nthe slash system folder, which means it's\n\n400\n00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.320\nbringing in data into an area that\nyou're not normally allowed to write to.\n\n401\n00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.170\nAnd oftentimes these are things\nthat require a reboot to install.\n\n402\n00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:33.700\nSo, for example, if I were to take, well,\nhere, let me go into my Examples folder.\n\n403\n00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.590\nThe OpenShot Video Editor.\n\n404\n00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.470\nSo if you ever wanna edit movies you\ncan use iMovie, iMovie works fine.\n\n405\n00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.560\nBu there's another program\nout there called OpenShot.\n\n406\n00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.480\nAnd it lets us do non-linear editing for\nvideo.\n\n407\n00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.180\nAnd if I go and download it, they send it\nto us as a dmg, which is a disk image.\n\n408\n00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:55.240\nAnd when you open that, you see what\nis very common with applications.\n\n409\n00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.070\nWhere it says you just need to\ndrag the OpenShot Video Editor and\n\n410\n00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.880\ndrop it into applications, okay?\n\n411\n00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.925\nNow when you do that, whats it doing?\n\n412\n00:21:04.925 --> 00:21:07.547\nI've already got it there so\nI'll just stop it.\n\n413\n00:21:07.547 --> 00:21:10.110\nBut what it's doing is\nits copying a folder.\n\n414\n00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.980\nIt's copying the OpenShot folder.\n\n415\n00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.290\nAnd so if I go and find OpenShot right\nhere, I can Show Package Contents.\n\n416\n00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.890\nAnd it's bringing over this whole\nfolder and copying it in here, right?\n\n417\n00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.550\nSo, that was easy,\nthe .apps you just copy over.\n\n418\n00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.260\nBut there's other things,\n\n419\n00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:30.520\nI have a USB monitor that I can plug\non to my laptop to add an extra screen.\n\n420\n00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.408\nAnd it uses a DisplayLink driver.\n\n421\n00:21:32.408 --> 00:21:37.280\nAnd the DisplayLink driver, well,\nthey sent it to me as a dmg.\n\n422\n00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.550\nSo let me get that pulled up here.\n\n423\n00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:40.180\nHere's the dmg.\n\n424\n00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.740\nAnd if I open that,\ninstead of showing me, hey, drag this and\n\n425\n00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:51.190\ndrop it in the applications, it gives me\na DisplayLink Software Installer.pkg.\n\n426\n00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:55.520\nA package file and then there's\na DisplayLink Software Uninstaller.\n\n427\n00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.500\nNormally when we uninstall an application,\nyou just drag and\n\n428\n00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.040\ndrop into the trash, but this one\nisn't installing into applications.\n\n429\n00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.860\nI'm not gonna see it that way and so\n\n430\n00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.140\nI can't uninstall it through the normal\nmeans, they have to provide me with one.\n\n431\n00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.850\nBut these pkg files,\n\n432\n00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.440\nyou normally just run them once to\ninstall whatever their contents are.\n\n433\n00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.680\nSo you're not gonna link to these like\nyou would applications or other things.\n\n434\n00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.430\nBut when you run them,\nit's going to do an install and\n\n435\n00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.730\nthey will almost always require\nadministrative privileges.\n\n436\n00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:24.210\nThe whole point of doing a pkg means that\nthey're usually gonna be writing files to\n\n437\n00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.980\nan area outside of the Applications\nfolder they won't have permissions to.\n\n438\n00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:32.250\nSo it'll prompt you to authenticate\nas an administrator, so\n\n439\n00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.930\nas I move through here\nI accept my licence.\n\n440\n00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:39.790\nI pick my install type,\nwhere it's gonna go, and I choose Install.\n\n441\n00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.280\nAs soon as I do that, there it goes.\n\n442\n00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:46.400\nIt's gonna prompt me, cuz it needs to have\nadministrative privileges to write it.\n\n443\n00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.940\nAnd then once it writes those files,\nit needs to reboot for\n\n444\n00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.790\nthem to be recognized by\nthe operating system.\n\n445\n00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:54.090\nAnd now my hardware would be supported,\nI can hook up my USB monitor, and\n\n446\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:55.570\nnow I'm in business.\n\n447\n00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.020\nSo these are special,\n\n448\n00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.510\nthere's a different type of\napplication than what we're used to.\n\n449\n00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:05.280\nBut at the end of the day it is still an\napplication, an installation application.\n\n450\n00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.720\nIt installs something.\n\n451\n00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.730\nAnd usually programs that we install\nthis way don't show up in Applications,\n\n452\n00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:13.810\ninstead they show up in\nour System Preferences.\n\n453\n00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.680\nSo when you go into\nthe System Preferences,\n\n454\n00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.130\nthose things will typically\nshow up down here.\n\n455\n00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.360\nYou'll see some other programs\nthat I've installed like that.\n\n456\n00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.889\nLike FUSE, which gives me\ndifferent file system support.\n\n457\n00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:30.170\nGPGPreferences, which lets me\ndo file encryption or Java.\n\n458\n00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.900\nThese were all installed with pkgs,\nwith packages, and\n\n459\n00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.540\neach one created a preference here.\n\n460\n00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.838\nNow you'll notice that I\ndon't have a DisplayLink one.\n\n461\n00:23:37.838 --> 00:23:41.410\nAnd that's because the DisplayLink one\njust installed a driver and that's it.\n\n462\n00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:44.750\nSo I put a driver in and\nI don't have any options to configure.\n\n463\n00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.000\nI just hook that other monitor up and\nthe monitor works.\n\n464\n00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.460\nThat's basically how that one goes.\n\n465\n00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.400\nBut just recognize that there are some\nvariations of applications that\n\n466\n00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.590\nare out there, but otherwise\neverything else that you work with,\n\n467\n00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:58.360\nyou can create aliases, you can create\nlinks on and they're gonna work just fine.\n\n468\n00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.244\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\n\n469\n00:24:00.244 --> 00:24:03.636\nwell, that's a lot of good information on\ntaking a look at managing file systems.\n\n470\n00:24:03.636 --> 00:24:06.964\nOne other thing that we took\nat in this episode, of course,\n\n471\n00:24:06.964 --> 00:24:11.025\nis the idea of being able to create\naliases and why we would also use them as\n\n472\n00:24:11.025 --> 00:24:15.753\nwell as the different links, the symbolic\nlinks and hard links showing that that's\n\n473\n00:24:15.753 --> 00:24:20.640\nwhat is underlying the operating system\nitself and we can also use those too.\n\n474\n00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.200\nThen Don helped us to\ndifferentiate between apps,\n\n475\n00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.090\nas well as some of the different\npackages that are out there.\n\n476\n00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.890\nThat's a great place for\nus to also sign off then.\n\n477\n00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.100\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n478\n00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.150\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n479\n00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:37.603\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nApple Certified Support Professional

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.996\nWelcome to ITPRO.TV, I'm your host-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n2\n00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:08.387\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:08.387 --> 00:00:12.212\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:15.204\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:19.590\nYou're watching the Apple Certified\nSupport Professional for Mac OS Sierra.\n\n6\n00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.000\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today we're\ngoing into a part two on managing files\n\n7\n00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.240\nwhich means we're digging a little\nbit deeper into the subject.\n\n8\n00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.200\nAnd here to help us out is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.660\nDon, welcome back to the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.650\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.160\nAnd yep, in the episode,\n\n12\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.600\nwe got a couple of really\ninteresting things to talk about.\n\n13\n00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.248\nThe more important topic that I want\nto hit in this episode is I want to\n\n14\n00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:41.235\ntalk about files and\nfolders that you can't see.\n\n15\n00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:42.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That are invisible\n\n16\n00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.450\nones that are hidden away.\n\n17\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.840\nWhen you look at the Mac OS GUIs.\n\n18\n00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.541\nWe browse around on the finder,\nyou see a lot of folders,\n\n19\n00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:51.130\nyou see a lot of easy to use icons.\n\n20\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.410\nIt's all designed to be easy to use.\n\n21\n00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.470\nAnd part of the way they made it easy is\nby hiding the stuff that wasn't easy,\n\n22\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.110\nright which is not\nnecessarily a bad thing.\n\n23\n00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.250\nThere's a lot more going on under\nthe hood though if you know it's there.\n\n24\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.360\nAnd sometimes we do need to interact\nwith it your end users typically won't.\n\n25\n00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.570\nYour average end user, their world kind\nof rotates around their Home folder.\n\n26\n00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.460\nThey usually don't go very far\naway from their Home folder.\n\n27\n00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.000\nBut as a System Administrator,\n\n28\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.288\nyou oftentimes will have\nto go outside of that.\n\n29\n00:01:18.288 --> 00:01:21.424\nAnd look at these other areas where\nthere might be a hidden folder or\n\n30\n00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:24.180\nsomething that you need\nto get into to work with.\n\n31\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.770\nSo just as a quick example here to\nshow you what I'm talking about.\n\n32\n00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.820\nIf I browse into my hard drive,\nwhat do I see?\n\n33\n00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.020\nWell, I just see five little folders here,\nand in fact, I have messed with mine, so\n\n34\n00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.850\nI have this extra folder.\n\n35\n00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.360\nNormally, you'll only see four.\n\n36\n00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.090\nApplications, libraries,\nsystem, and user, but\n\n37\n00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.690\nthere's actually a lot more\nthan these that show up.\n\n38\n00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.890\nIf I were to drop into a terminal and\ngo into my root folder and\n\n39\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.682\ntake a look, I'll see that there's\nactually about twice as many.\n\n40\n00:01:53.682 --> 00:01:57.558\nWe've got applications, library, network,\nsystem, users, volume, bin, cores,\n\n41\n00:01:57.558 --> 00:01:58.078\ndev, etc.\n\n42\n00:01:58.078 --> 00:02:01.395\nHome, installer.failurerequests.\n\n43\n00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:02.215\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Clearly,\n\n44\n00:02:02.215 --> 00:02:03.600\nI have screwed something up somewhere.\n\n45\n00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.050\nnet, opt, private, sbin,\ntmp, usr and var various.\n\n46\n00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.766\nSo, all these different folders but,\nI didn't see those a minute ago.\n\n47\n00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:15.770\nAnd that's because most people never\nhave to mess with these other folders.\n\n48\n00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.504\nA lot of these are tied to\nthe UNIX Operating System that is running\n\n49\n00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:19.209\nunder the hood.\n\n50\n00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.220\nAnd so, we don't need to mess with that.\n\n51\n00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.930\nBut some of these aren't\nnecessarily tied to Unix,\n\n52\n00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.030\nthey're just being hidden\nto keep people out of them.\n\n53\n00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.980\nFor example, /volumes.\n\n54\n00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.660\nWhenever I plug in a USB drive,\nit gets mounted, and\n\n55\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.410\nit gets mounted under that volumes folder,\nthat's where it is.\n\n56\n00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.860\nBut when I come in here,\nI don't see volumes in the list.\n\n57\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.070\nEven though I can browse through\nthe USB drive or whatever,\n\n58\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.260\nI won't see the volumes folder itself.\n\n59\n00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.220\nSo when something is hidden like that,\nit's really just hidden to make life easy.\n\n60\n00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.020\nIt's not hidden to stop\nyou from going there.\n\n61\n00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.490\nYou can still browse to\nthese hidden folders.\n\n62\n00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.423\nSo for example,\n\n63\n00:02:54.423 --> 00:02:58.771\n/volumes if I wanna browse to it I can go\nup top to my menu here where it says Go.\n\n64\n00:02:58.771 --> 00:03:04.008\nAnd under the Go menu I'll see\nwhere I can choose go to folder.\n\n65\n00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:10.430\nAnd under Go to Folder, I can choose that,\nand I can type in whatever folder I want.\n\n66\n00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.603\nAnd you can even use tab auto complete\nin this which is kind of nice.\n\n67\n00:03:13.603 --> 00:03:16.510\nBut I can punch in /volumes.\n\n68\n00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.611\nAnd when I hit go, it browse's to it.\n\n69\n00:03:19.611 --> 00:03:22.296\nThere's my hard drive and\nmy mobile time machine backups, right.\n\n70\n00:03:22.296 --> 00:03:25.490\nOr if I plug in a USB drive,\nit would show up here too.\n\n71\n00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.470\nI can get to it.\n\n72\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.765\nIt's not forbidden.\n\n73\n00:03:27.765 --> 00:03:29.970\nIt's not block off with permissions.\n\n74\n00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.970\nIt's just hidden to\nmake life easier on us.\n\n75\n00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.760\nNow, if we wanna hide something,\n\n76\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.300\nthere's actually two different ways\nthat you can hide things in Mac OS.\n\n77\n00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.490\nThere's the standard Unix way and\n\n78\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.210\nthen there's the Apple way as with most\nof the things we've learned about here.\n\n79\n00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.880\nThere's always two ways of doing things.\n\n80\n00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.110\nThe standard Unix way is if\nyou want to hide something,\n\n81\n00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.890\nyou just stick a dot before it.\n\n82\n00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.480\nIf the file name starts with a dot,\na period then it hides it.\n\n83\n00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.070\nSimple as that, right?\n\n84\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.750\nSo for example,\nif I'm sitting here on my desktop and\n\n85\n00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.810\nI create a folder called Secrets, right?\n\n86\n00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.680\nSo this is gonna be where\nI store all of my secrets.\n\n87\n00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.510\nAnd if I take that folder and I just take\na dot at the beginning of it, right?\n\n88\n00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.350\nWhen I do that,\nthe GUI says you can't do that,\n\n89\n00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.510\nyou can't start a folder with a dot,\nbecause that name,\n\n90\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.320\nthis name is a reserved for the system,\nplease choose another name, right?\n\n91\n00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.500\nIt's telling me I can't do it, because the\nfolder would effectively disappear, and\n\n92\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.030\nI would lose it, right?\n\n93\n00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.250\nBut from the terminal,\nif I get into my terminal, and\n\n94\n00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.980\ngo into my desktop, and take a look.\n\n95\n00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.080\nThere's my secrets folder.\n\n96\n00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.540\nAnd I can rename it, and\nstick a dot before it, right?\n\n97\n00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.350\nI can actually say, mv,\nwhich is the move command.\n\n98\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:51.595\nAnd I can move secrets to be .Secrets,\nlike that, okay?\n\n99\n00:04:51.595 --> 00:04:55.506\nAnd I don't know, I should have pointed\nit out, but that folder just disappeared,\n\n100\n00:04:55.506 --> 00:04:57.330\nright here in the background.\n\n101\n00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.840\nIt disappeared, because now it has\na dot at the beginning of its name, and\n\n102\n00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.920\nso it's hidden.\n\n103\n00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.660\nIt is still there, but\neven when I do the Unix ls command,\n\n104\n00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.660\nthe list command,\nI don't see it there either.\n\n105\n00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.840\nIt's disappeared,\nI just lost all my secrets.\n\n106\n00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.630\nThis is a tragedy, right?\n\n107\n00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.700\nWell, I didn't lose them.\n\n108\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.070\nI just need to do an ls -a,\nto say show me all files,\n\n109\n00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.690\nnot just the ones that\nare normally visible.\n\n110\n00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.520\nAnd when I do that,\nI should find .Secrets is right back.\n\n111\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.340\nAnd you'll see there's some other ones\nthat I didn't highlight, like .localized.\n\n112\n00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.060\nI didn't make that.\n\n113\n00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.770\nThat was part of my default user profile.\n\n114\n00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.220\nOr .DS_Store, I'm seeing these\nother ones that are hidden\n\n115\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.010\nwith a dot at the beginning of them.\n\n116\n00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.040\nAnd it could be a file or\nit could be a folder, right?\n\n117\n00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.350\nIn this case,\nI think these are all folders.\n\n118\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.952\nLet me add a -held just to be sure.\n\n119\n00:05:46.952 --> 00:05:49.250\nNo not .localize this are file.\n\n120\n00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.900\nSo it's just a regular file that\nhas a dot on the beginning of it so\n\n121\n00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.970\nit's hiding it from the user interface,\nright?\n\n122\n00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.154\nAnd if I go into .Secrets for\nexample, I could start creating\n\n123\n00:06:00.154 --> 00:06:04.752\nfiles like secret1.txt or\nsecret2.txt and so on.\n\n124\n00:06:04.752 --> 00:06:09.480\nI could start creating files and\nin the GUI, I don't see that.\n\n125\n00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.770\nIf I browse into my Finder and\nI go into my user, my Home folder and\n\n126\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.830\nI go into my Desktop,\nI don't see that .Secrets.\n\n127\n00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.420\nBut if I choose Go and Go to Folder,\n\n128\n00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.180\nI can type in my Home folder\nwhich there's a UNIX alias.\n\n129\n00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.940\nWhen you wanna go to your home\nfolder you can type slash.\n\n130\n00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.592\nBut if I wanted to do the full one\nI could just say /Users/DonPezet\n\n131\n00:06:33.592 --> 00:06:36.926\nwhich it doesn't want to autocomplete for\nme.\n\n132\n00:06:36.926 --> 00:06:39.280\ndpezet, sorry I have my Unix name.\n\n133\n00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.550\nAnd then Desktop and then .Secrets.\n\n134\n00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.590\nAnd see how I was even able\nto tab autocomplete cuz it's\n\n135\n00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.250\njust visually hidden.\n\n136\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.750\nAnd when I choose Go.\n\n137\n00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.979\nThere is secret one, there is secret two,\nand I can work with them.\n\n138\n00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:53.830\nYou'll find that a lot.\n\n139\n00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.710\nThere's things that are hidden.\n\n140\n00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.260\nThere's like secrets in the GUI sometimes.\n\n141\n00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.233\nFor example, in every home folder,\nthere is a folder called Library.\n\n142\n00:07:01.233 --> 00:07:03.180\nAnd we're gonna talk more about\nthe Library folder in a minute.\n\n143\n00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.590\nIt's a really important one.\n\n144\n00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.920\nBut when I go to my Home folder\nI don't see the Library.\n\n145\n00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.300\nAnd when I use the Go menu up here,\nand I see all this stuff,\n\n146\n00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.230\nI don't see the Library in there either.\n\n147\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.920\nBut if I hold the Option key down on\nmy keyboard, see how the menu changes?\n\n148\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.010\nAnd it makes Library show up.\n\n149\n00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.460\nLibrary's hidden from the GUI by default,\nbut if I hold the Option key down,\n\n150\n00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.060\nit gives me a shortcut, so I can jump and\nbrowse right into that Library folder.\n\n151\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.900\nSo this is some kind of secret things\nthat are hidden away in the GUI.\n\n152\n00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.918\nNow the example I gave you a minute\nago was hiding something the Unix way.\n\n153\n00:07:36.918 --> 00:07:39.240\nYou stick a dot before the name.\n\n154\n00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.580\nBut you can hide things without\nputting a dot before its name.\n\n155\n00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.635\nThe Library folder I just showed you.\n\n156\n00:07:45.635 --> 00:07:48.435\nIf I take a look at my home folders,\nit's right here.\n\n157\n00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:50.205\nIt doesn't have a dot, right.\n\n158\n00:07:50.205 --> 00:07:52.689\nThat's because it was\nhidden the Apple way.\n\n159\n00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:57.395\nAnd Apple actually has a file flag that\nthey use that flags a file that was hidden\n\n160\n00:07:57.395 --> 00:08:02.168\nwithout having a dot at the beginning of\nit's name So, for example, if I go back\n\n161\n00:08:02.168 --> 00:08:06.760\nto my desktop, I'm gonna take my .Secrets\nfolder that I made a minute ago.\n\n162\n00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.070\nI'm gonna get rid of that dot.\n\n163\n00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:17.733\nSo I'm gonna move .Secrets to\njust regular old Secrets, there.\n\n164\n00:08:17.733 --> 00:08:22.721\nAnd so now it shows up, and I should\nactually see it in the background here.\n\n165\n00:08:22.721 --> 00:08:23.547\nYep, there it is.\n\n166\n00:08:23.547 --> 00:08:26.940\nMy Secrets folder is now\nshowing up in the GUI.\n\n167\n00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.880\nNow I'm gonna use\nthe change flags command.\n\n168\n00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.460\nThere's a setting,\n\n169\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.480\nwhich is a flag, that's gonna indicate\nthat I want this file to be hidden.\n\n170\n00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.634\nAnd let me just shrink this up a little\nbit so we can kinda watch what happens.\n\n171\n00:08:42.634 --> 00:08:47.260\nMy Secrets folder is right\nhere on the screen, and\n\n172\n00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:52.229\nthe command that I'm gonna\nissue is chflags hidden.\n\n173\n00:08:52.229 --> 00:08:54.528\nAnd then I'll specify who\nit is that I'm changing.\n\n174\n00:08:54.528 --> 00:08:56.208\nI'm changing the Secrets folder.\n\n175\n00:08:56.208 --> 00:09:00.702\nSo I'm gonna change the hidden flag\nto turn it on, and when I do that,\n\n176\n00:09:00.702 --> 00:09:02.187\nyou see it disappear?\n\n177\n00:09:02.187 --> 00:09:03.271\nAnd now it's gone.\n\n178\n00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:06.734\nIt doesn't have a dot at the beginning of\nits name, it just has a flag activated\n\n179\n00:09:06.734 --> 00:09:10.650\nthat says hide this from the GUI, and\nso now it's hidden, and that's that.\n\n180\n00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.449\nRight, if I do a chflags nohidden, right,\n\n181\n00:09:15.449 --> 00:09:19.355\nit reappears, and now it's back.\n\n182\n00:09:19.355 --> 00:09:21.887\nSo I can quickly and\neasily change it that way, and\n\n183\n00:09:21.887 --> 00:09:24.530\nthat is how the library folder is hidden.\n\n184\n00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.810\nThat's how the other folders that\ndidn't show up in the GUI but\n\n185\n00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.440\ndidn't have a dot at the beginning of\nthe name, that's how they were hidden.\n\n186\n00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.822\nSo, two different ways to hide it.\n\n187\n00:09:31.822 --> 00:09:34.820\nYou can stick a dot at the beginning,\nthat's the Unix way.\n\n188\n00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.921\nOr you can use chflags and\nturn on the hidden flag.\n\n189\n00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:39.382\nThat's the Apple way.\n\n190\n00:09:39.382 --> 00:09:43.324\nBoth ways work, and as far as the GUI\nis concerned they're the same.\n\n191\n00:09:43.324 --> 00:09:47.172\nHow you pick which one to use is, can you\nafford to have a dot in the name, right?\n\n192\n00:09:47.172 --> 00:09:48.855\nSometimes you might have an application or\n\n193\n00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:51.152\nsomething that expects the folder\nto have a certain name.\n\n194\n00:09:51.152 --> 00:09:52.240\nYou don't want a dot.\n\n195\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.570\nRight, so\nthat's gonna rule out the Unix way.\n\n196\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:59.670\nBut once it's done, the effect is\nthe same, it's going to be hidden.\n\n197\n00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.461\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don, I have a question here.\n\n198\n00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:05.752\nIs there a reason I shouldn't\nunhide those system\n\n199\n00:10:05.752 --> 00:10:09.234\nfolders that are already hidden for me?\n\n200\n00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:12.160\n&gt;&gt; As far as the operating\nsystem is concerned, no.\n\n201\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.420\nYou're not gonna hurt\nanything by turning them on.\n\n202\n00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.360\nBut what it is going to hurt-\n&gt;&gt; The user?\n\n203\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.890\n&gt;&gt; Is you're gonna enable the user, yeah.\n\n204\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.430\nThe users are gonna see things\nthey wouldn't normally see.\n\n205\n00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.528\nAnd that means they can now cause\nproblems they wouldn't normally cause.\n\n206\n00:10:23.528 --> 00:10:28.816\nSo while unhiding them, that action\nitself, doesn't hurt the system,\n\n207\n00:10:28.816 --> 00:10:33.635\nonce you turn your users loose on it,\nit'll hurt the system, so.\n\n208\n00:10:33.635 --> 00:10:36.870\n[LAUGH] Imagine the library folder,\nlibrary is hidden.\n\n209\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.625\nBut you have full write access to the\nwhole thing because that's where all of\n\n210\n00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:41.532\nyour application preferences are stored,\nright?\n\n211\n00:10:41.532 --> 00:10:45.675\nSo if I fire up Microsoft Word and\nI tell it I want a blue background, and\n\n212\n00:10:45.675 --> 00:10:50.420\nthen I log out and Ronnie logs in,\nhe'll still have a white background.\n\n213\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.380\nBecause his preferences are stored\nsomewhere else than mine.\n\n214\n00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.770\nMy preferences are stored\nin my library folder,\n\n215\n00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.450\nhis preferences are in his library folder.\n\n216\n00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.400\nSo if I had access to the library folder\nand I browsed in there and started\n\n217\n00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.570\nmessing around with things, I might break\nMicrosoft Word where it won't run for me.\n\n218\n00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.008\nIt will run for other users but\nit won't run for me.\n\n219\n00:11:06.008 --> 00:11:08.852\nThat's the kind of problem we can cause\nwhen we have access to these folders that\n\n220\n00:11:08.852 --> 00:11:09.663\nare normally hidden.\n\n221\n00:11:09.663 --> 00:11:14.110\nYour average user should not need\naccess to these, but it may happen.\n\n222\n00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.170\nFrom time to time, there may be instances\nwhere you need that type of access.\n\n223\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.917\nAll right, let's talk a little bit more\nabout some of the folders that we've\n\n224\n00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:23.970\nbeen seeing.\n\n225\n00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.111\nI mentioned how if I browse to\nthe hard drive on a normal system,\n\n226\n00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:30.232\nyou'll only see four folders.\n\n227\n00:11:30.232 --> 00:11:32.293\nNow, mine has a fifth one,\nthis opt folder,\n\n228\n00:11:32.293 --> 00:11:35.613\nwhich is an optional one because I\ninstalled Cisco Anyconnect, right?\n\n229\n00:11:35.613 --> 00:11:37.017\nWhich I actually don't use, so\n\n230\n00:11:37.017 --> 00:11:39.253\nI could just delete that\nif I really wanna go crazy.\n\n231\n00:11:39.253 --> 00:11:42.324\nWell, I'll leave it [LAUGH].\n\n232\n00:11:42.324 --> 00:11:45.657\nSo, sometimes third party software\nwill add folders like this.\n\n233\n00:11:45.657 --> 00:11:48.784\nBut had I not,\nI would only see four folders here,\n\n234\n00:11:48.784 --> 00:11:51.860\nApplications, Library, System, and Users.\n\n235\n00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.570\nSo let's talk about what each one is.\n\n236\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.936\nApplications, that's\nwhere our programs go.\n\n237\n00:11:56.936 --> 00:11:58.043\nPretty cut and dry right there, right?\n\n238\n00:11:58.043 --> 00:12:01.290\nThe Applications folder is where\nwe store our applications.\n\n239\n00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.490\nBut there is something special about it.\n\n240\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.516\nThese are applications that I want\nevery user to have access to.\n\n241\n00:12:08.516 --> 00:12:10.865\nWhat if I only want me\nto have access to it?\n\n242\n00:12:10.865 --> 00:12:13.054\nI'm gonna install an application just for\nme.\n\n243\n00:12:13.054 --> 00:12:16.630\nI might share this computer with other\npeople, but this program is just for me.\n\n244\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.410\nWell, there's more than\none Applications folder.\n\n245\n00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.130\nThis one, the one that's\nright off of your hard drive,\n\n246\n00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.060\nis shared amongst all your users.\n\n247\n00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.691\nAnd when you install an app from\nthe App Store, this is where it goes.\n\n248\n00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:30.765\nAnd when you install most third\nparty apps, this is where they go.\n\n249\n00:12:30.765 --> 00:12:34.635\nBut if you install an app just for you,\nit actually goes into your home folder.\n\n250\n00:12:34.635 --> 00:12:40.330\nIf I go into my home folder, I've got\nan Applications folder there also.\n\n251\n00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.340\nNow, it might not show up for you.\n\n252\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.510\nIf this is a new install, you might not\nhave any applications installed just for\n\n253\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.110\nyou and the folder might not exist.\n\n254\n00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:49.500\nYou can create it if you want.\n\n255\n00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.990\nJust create a folder named Applications.\n\n256\n00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.442\nIt will recognize it and\nit will add the icon to it, right?\n\n257\n00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:55.780\nIt's automatic.\n\n258\n00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.510\nOr you just wait, and the first time you\ninstall an application and say you want it\n\n259\n00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.343\nto be available just for you, it will make\nthe folder if it doesn't already exist.\n\n260\n00:13:01.343 --> 00:13:04.024\nBut these will be applications that\nare installed just for you, and\n\n261\n00:13:04.024 --> 00:13:06.340\nyou'll see I have Google Chrome installed.\n\n262\n00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.460\nAnd Chrome has several applications\nthat it brings along that run\n\n263\n00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.130\ninside of the web browser.\n\n264\n00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.282\nAnd so I can see where these\nhave been added just for me.\n\n265\n00:13:15.282 --> 00:13:18.237\nIf somebody else wants them,\nthey would have to have Chrome and\n\n266\n00:13:18.237 --> 00:13:21.373\nhave the extensions turned on and\nso on, but those are just for me.\n\n267\n00:13:21.373 --> 00:13:23.896\nSo there is more than one\nApplications folder, but\n\n268\n00:13:23.896 --> 00:13:26.829\nthe one that's right off of your\nhard drive is the main one,\n\n269\n00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:30.246\nand that's where the bulk of your\napplications are going to reside.\n\n270\n00:13:30.246 --> 00:13:31.994\nSo you have all sorts of\ncrazy stuff in there,\n\n271\n00:13:31.994 --> 00:13:33.650\ndepending on what all you've installed.\n\n272\n00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.044\nThe next one is Library.\n\n273\n00:13:36.044 --> 00:13:38.185\nNow, I talked about the Library\nfolder a moment ago, and\n\n274\n00:13:38.185 --> 00:13:40.570\nI said that's where my user\npreferences are stored.\n\n275\n00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.370\nIt's actually a lot more than that,\n\n276\n00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.320\nand there's technically four\ndifferent Library folders.\n\n277\n00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.298\nSo the Library folder is where\nour user preferences are stored,\n\n278\n00:13:50.298 --> 00:13:55.248\nas well as application configuration\nfiles, a lot of drivers, custom fonts.\n\n279\n00:13:55.248 --> 00:13:58.675\nReally any customization we make to the\noperating system is going to be stored in\n\n280\n00:13:58.675 --> 00:13:59.659\nthat Library folder.\n\n281\n00:13:59.659 --> 00:14:04.469\nSo it is a collecting grounds for\na ton of modifications and other things.\n\n282\n00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:08.530\nNot applications, but the supporting files\nfor those applications will be in there.\n\n283\n00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.840\nThe System folder, that's where Mac OS is.\n\n284\n00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.490\nWhen you install Mac OS, this is\nwhere the operating system resides.\n\n285\n00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.130\nSo in theory,\n\n286\n00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.390\nyou should never mess with anything\ninside of the System folder, right?\n\n287\n00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.183\nBut as I expand it out,\nyou'll see there is a Library folder.\n\n288\n00:14:22.183 --> 00:14:23.519\nI'll talk about that in just a minute.\n\n289\n00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:25.366\nBut there's a lot more\ninside of that folder.\n\n290\n00:14:25.366 --> 00:14:30.521\nIt looks pretty empty but if I go to\nmy terminal, and I go into /System.\n\n291\n00:14:30.521 --> 00:14:34.661\nAnd I'll do a ls -la for the long view and\nshow all files, and I can see,\n\n292\n00:14:34.661 --> 00:14:38.320\nactually there's not a whole heck\nof a lot in there, is there?\n\n293\n00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.860\n[LAUGH] So I've got Library,\nand you know what?\n\n294\n00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.170\nI'm not an administrator right now, so\nit's kinda hiding some of this from me.\n\n295\n00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.820\nBut if I continue to poke around in there,\nyou'll see there's\n\n296\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:53.370\nquite a bit of stuff kinda tucked away\nin here, as far as our system and\n\n297\n00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.870\nall the other things that go along with\nit, all kind of tucked inside of there.\n\n298\n00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.980\nAll right, so the system,\nthat's what's supporting Mac OS.\n\n299\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.683\nIt used to be that when you went in\nthere you saw everything right away, but\n\n300\n00:15:04.683 --> 00:15:06.854\nwe now have system integrity protection.\n\n301\n00:15:06.854 --> 00:15:11.063\nAnd system integrity protection,\nin addition to being really hard to say,\n\n302\n00:15:11.063 --> 00:15:15.420\nmakes sure that we can't tamper with\nthe operating system files themselves.\n\n303\n00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.590\nSo that's why when I browse in there,\nI really don't see much.\n\n304\n00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.570\nI just see that Library folder and\na .localized.\n\n305\n00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.550\nThere's actually a bunch of files in here\nthat are completely hidden and obstructed\n\n306\n00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:30.830\nfrom me unless I override that and become\nthe root user to be able to see those.\n\n307\n00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:35.320\nThey are there, and if you tamper with\nthem, it'll actually work to put them back\n\n308\n00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.270\nand you can run Repair and fix them and\nget the system back up and operational.\n\n309\n00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.166\nAll right,\nthe last folder here is the User folder.\n\n310\n00:15:42.166 --> 00:15:45.745\nI mentioned how every user's world kind\nof rotates around their Home folder.\n\n311\n00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:48.556\nThis is where the Home folders are,\nso I see I've got one.\n\n312\n00:15:48.556 --> 00:15:50.647\nI made an account for\nRonnie, so he's got one.\n\n313\n00:15:50.647 --> 00:15:54.013\nAnd there's the Shared folder which is\ntechnically shared amongst all the users\n\n314\n00:15:54.013 --> 00:15:55.361\nif they wanted to collaborate.\n\n315\n00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:57.570\nWe talked about that\nin an earlier episode.\n\n316\n00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.090\nSo that's where those user\nprofiles are residing.\n\n317\n00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.580\nAnd inside of a Users profile, you'll\nsometimes see duplicates of the folders\n\n318\n00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.480\nthat we talked about like applications or\n\n319\n00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.979\nlike library where those are settings\nin things that are just for them.\n\n320\n00:16:09.979 --> 00:16:15.978\nSo slightly customized version of\nwhatever that folder or file is.\n\n321\n00:16:15.978 --> 00:16:18.757\nAll right,\nlet's talk about the Library real quick.\n\n322\n00:16:18.757 --> 00:16:22.300\nI mention they were four\ndifferent libraries.\n\n323\n00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.210\nWith each of these we have\nwhat are called domains.\n\n324\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:29.160\nA domain is like the sphere\nof influence of a setting.\n\n325\n00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.030\nWhen I mentioned applications,\nthere was the global applications folder\n\n326\n00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.630\nthat if I put an application in there,\nit worked for everybody.\n\n327\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.680\nAnd then I mentioned how there was an\napplication folder in my own user profile.\n\n328\n00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.160\nAnd so that was just for me, right?\n\n329\n00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.320\nWell the domain for the global and\n\n330\n00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:50.360\nthe main Applications folder, that one\nis what's called the local domain.\n\n331\n00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.200\nAnd then the application folder that's\nin my own user profile is called\n\n332\n00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.360\nthe user domain.\n\n333\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.220\nWell, the Library folder is\nstructured like that too.\n\n334\n00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.000\nYou have these domains except\nyou have four of them.\n\n335\n00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.030\nEach one does a different purpose, right?\n\n336\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.530\nSo, right off the root of my hard drive,\nI've got a Library folder.\n\n337\n00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.460\nSo slash library.\n\n338\n00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:11.550\nAnd that is my local domain for\napplication configurations and settings.\n\n339\n00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:16.510\nSo you'll have a bunch of stuff in here\nthat applies to every user on my system.\n\n340\n00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:20.620\nSo for example, I've got a google folder\nand inside of that a Chrome folder.\n\n341\n00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:24.329\nAnd here's information that\nwould apply to Google Chrome for\n\n342\n00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.477\nevery user on this laptop, right.\n\n343\n00:17:26.477 --> 00:17:27.780\nAnd so that's the local domain.\n\n344\n00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:33.800\nBut if I go into my own user folder and\ninto Library, into that hidden Library.\n\n345\n00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.090\nI'll use my Go menu here and\nthe Option key to get to it.\n\n346\n00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.500\nI can come in here and in this Library,\n\n347\n00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:47.390\nI can find Google and\nI don't see that same folder.\n\n348\n00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:51.530\nThat means that I'm using the global\nsettings, the local domain and\n\n349\n00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.860\nnot overriding it here at the user domain.\n\n350\n00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.959\nYou can override settings\nat the user domain.\n\n351\n00:17:55.959 --> 00:17:58.107\nAnd this Google folder isn't the only one.\n\n352\n00:17:58.107 --> 00:18:01.430\nYou'll notice that if I scroll up\nhere I've got Application Support.\n\n353\n00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.820\nMost applications will put their settings\nin there under Application Support.\n\n354\n00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.150\nAnd so if I go in here I should\nhave another Google folder.\n\n355\n00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:11.900\nHere is another one and inside of it\nChrome and then here is overrides for\n\n356\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.060\na tonne of settings that are just me.\n\n357\n00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.880\nI have my own Avatar.\n\n358\n00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.105\nIf it's another user they\nwould have their own Avatar.\n\n359\n00:18:18.105 --> 00:18:21.280\nThey're not gonna use my picture,\nthey probably wouldn't use my picture.\n\n360\n00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.410\nSo, each of those settings\nbeing tracked separately.\n\n361\n00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.500\nThese are the two that you're gonna\nuse the most, the local domain and\n\n362\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.790\nthe user domain, right?\n\n363\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.741\nSo slash library, or\nthe user's home folder slash library.\n\n364\n00:18:32.741 --> 00:18:34.913\nSame thing with applications,\nslash applications, or\n\n365\n00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:36.690\nthe user's home folder slash applications.\n\n366\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:40.210\nBut there's two more domains that we\ndon't hear about very often, right?\n\n367\n00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.081\nThe next one is called the network domain.\n\n368\n00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:46.830\nAnd the network domain\nis stored in a folder.\n\n369\n00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.310\nAgain, off of your hard drive,\nand it would be slash network.\n\n370\n00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.830\nAnd it's just a folder called Network.\n\n371\n00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.892\nNow I don't have that,\nI don't have the Network folder.\n\n372\n00:18:53.892 --> 00:18:56.560\nIn fact, I think even if I\nget terminal I don't have it.\n\n373\n00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.070\nLet me just go and check and see.\n\n374\n00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.550\nI do it.\nJust hidden.\n\n375\n00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:02.270\nSo I've got it.\n\n376\n00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.460\nLet me go to it here.\n\n377\n00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:10.020\nSo I'll use the Go to folder and\nI'm gonna browse to /network, okay?\n\n378\n00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.800\nInside of the Network folder,\nI see Servers.\n\n379\n00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.230\nWhat's that talking about?\n\n380\n00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.934\nWell, if you are bound\nto a directory service,\n\n381\n00:19:16.934 --> 00:19:20.584\nif we bound to apple open directory,\nthere might be settings and\n\n382\n00:19:20.584 --> 00:19:24.253\npreferences that apply to network\nusers and network settings.\n\n383\n00:19:24.253 --> 00:19:26.630\nAnd those will go in the network domain.\n\n384\n00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:27.700\nIf you're like me and\n\n385\n00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.460\nmy laptop is not bound to a directory\nit's usually gonna be empty, right?\n\n386\n00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.800\nYou might see a Servers folder like I\ndo was servers that you connected to.\n\n387\n00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.150\nWell, this is just defining\nmy system at the server,\n\n388\n00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.030\nI must have installed\nthe server app on here.\n\n389\n00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:44.040\nBut otherwise there's not much in here,\nright So the network domain is designed\n\n390\n00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.640\nfor when you're bound to a directory and\nyou got settings and permissions that\n\n391\n00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.990\napply to application and other\nresources you're accessing on a server.\n\n392\n00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.430\nAnd in the fourth domain\nis the system domain.\n\n393\n00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.960\nWhen I browse into the system\nfolder a moment ago we saw\n\n394\n00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.820\na Library folder there as well.\n\n395\n00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.320\nSo if go in the System and\ninto Library, here's Settings also.\n\n396\n00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.030\nNow these are different\nthan the other domains.\n\n397\n00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:10.390\nThe other domains, the user, local, and\nnetwork, those really apply to pretty much\n\n398\n00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:13.840\nany application that we run, and\nthere's settings that affect the users.\n\n399\n00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.360\nThis one, the system domain,\nonly affects the operating system.\n\n400\n00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.360\nAnd so you will only see settings\nin here that apply to the core\n\n401\n00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.560\nprocesses that make up Mac OS.\n\n402\n00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.940\nSo when you install Mac OS,\nthis folder is created and it's got\n\n403\n00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.340\nalso sorts of settings and information\nin it for the Apple products, right?\n\n404\n00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.670\nYou typically will not see third\nparty products store their data here.\n\n405\n00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:39.344\nThey can if they want, but\nin the Apple design guide,\n\n406\n00:20:39.344 --> 00:20:41.966\nthey're supposed to not put it here.\n\n407\n00:20:41.966 --> 00:20:44.587\nAnd if they submit it to the app store,\nthey'll get rejected if they try and\n\n408\n00:20:44.587 --> 00:20:45.870\nstore things here.\n\n409\n00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.600\nBut if you're downloading third party\napps from out there on the cloud,\n\n410\n00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.620\nfrom anywhere else they don't go\nthrough the App Store checks and\n\n411\n00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.410\nthey might choose to store some things\nhere, but they really shouldn't.\n\n412\n00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.160\nMost applications shouldn't right here,\nbut it does exist.\n\n413\n00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.140\nAnd most of what you're seeing\nhere is just core functions\n\n414\n00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.249\nof Mac OS that are kinda stored\naway right inside of here.\n\n415\n00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.850\nAll right, so\nthose are our four domains, and\n\n416\n00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:11.160\nthat's why we see four different\nlibrary folders in some scenarios.\n\n417\n00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.160\nNormally there's just two\nthat we care about, right?\n\n418\n00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.195\nThe one in the user's home folder and\nthe one right off of our hard drive.\n\n419\n00:21:18.195 --> 00:21:22.670\nAll right, inside of the Library folder,\nwhat do we have?\n\n420\n00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:23.660\nWe have a lot of stuff.\n\n421\n00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.927\nLet me get back to the main\nLibrary folder for my system.\n\n422\n00:21:26.927 --> 00:21:31.100\nAnd when you go in here\nthere's a ton of folders.\n\n423\n00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.340\nAnd some of them are really important,\nsome of them aren't.\n\n424\n00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.977\nI just want to skim through a couple\nreal quick to give you guys an idea\n\n425\n00:21:35.977 --> 00:21:36.686\nwhat's in here.\n\n426\n00:21:36.686 --> 00:21:40.770\nFor example, the Extensions\nfolder is a really handy one.\n\n427\n00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:45.690\nExtensions are things that add on\nfunctionality to your operating system.\n\n428\n00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.340\nYou're usually gonna see\nyour drivers installed here.\n\n429\n00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.410\nSee all these files that end in kext?\n\n430\n00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.230\nThat's a kernel extension.\n\n431\n00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:56.267\nIf I buy a proprietary scanner or\na 360 camera or\n\n432\n00:21:56.267 --> 00:22:02.337\nsome kind of special storage device I\nmight have to install a driver for it.\n\n433\n00:22:02.337 --> 00:22:05.326\nAnd you'll see where I've\ninstalled some drivers,\n\n434\n00:22:05.326 --> 00:22:09.523\nthese black magic that I installed for\na video recording device that I use.\n\n435\n00:22:09.523 --> 00:22:15.296\nMost of this other stuff either came with\nit, or whatever, here my Logitech, right?\n\n436\n00:22:15.296 --> 00:22:19.551\nI have a little trackball I use in my\noffice, so I had to install drivers for\n\n437\n00:22:19.551 --> 00:22:21.074\nthat XBox 360 remote.\n\n438\n00:22:21.074 --> 00:22:21.694\nHad to have that.\n\n439\n00:22:21.694 --> 00:22:22.470\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n440\n00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:23.740\n&gt;&gt; So I gotta load a driver for that.\n\n441\n00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.370\nSo these are kernel extensions that extend\n\n442\n00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:26.770\nthe functionality of\nyour operating system.\n\n443\n00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.481\nAnd they're stored here,\nnot in the System folder.\n\n444\n00:22:29.481 --> 00:22:31.220\nBecause the System\nfolder's really protected.\n\n445\n00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.570\nWe're not supposed to write things there.\n\n446\n00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:33.520\nSo it gets stored here too.\n\n447\n00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.130\nSo that's the Extensions folder.\n\n448\n00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.650\nWe also have the Fonts folder.\n\n449\n00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:44.074\nNow the Fonts folder, it always shows\nup on the exam for some reason.\n\n450\n00:22:44.074 --> 00:22:45.950\nIn real life you don't\nare about this thing.\n\n451\n00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.940\nThey're very few do,\nif you're a type setter and\n\n452\n00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.960\nyou really care about your fonts.\n\n453\n00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.717\nBut it shows on the exam.\n\n454\n00:22:51.717 --> 00:22:55.229\nSo all of your screen fonts are typically\nstored right here inside of\n\n455\n00:22:55.229 --> 00:22:56.460\nthe fonts folder.\n\n456\n00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.849\nThere are some inside\nof the system library.\n\n457\n00:22:58.849 --> 00:23:01.385\nThey come with the core OS usually\nthe once created by Apple.\n\n458\n00:23:01.385 --> 00:23:03.655\nBut these are the ones\nthat Apple's licensed, or\n\n459\n00:23:03.655 --> 00:23:07.405\nthat other products you've installed\nhave licensed, they'll add them here.\n\n460\n00:23:07.405 --> 00:23:09.005\nYou can mess with these files.\n\n461\n00:23:09.005 --> 00:23:15.085\nYou could drop a font file, a TTF,\na True Type Font right into this folder.\n\n462\n00:23:15.085 --> 00:23:18.644\nBut on the exam,\nyou don't wanna say you did that.\n\n463\n00:23:18.644 --> 00:23:22.810\n[LAUGH] Instead, where you're supposed\nto use the utility called font book.\n\n464\n00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.000\nIf I bring up my spot light and\njust type font,\n\n465\n00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.980\nit will be the first thing\ncause of that font book.\n\n466\n00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.550\nThe font book is nice cuz\nI see all the fonts and\n\n467\n00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:32.440\nyou can see what they look like,\nand you can add fonts in.\n\n468\n00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.117\nYou got a little plus sign right here\nwhere you can add a font if you've\n\n469\n00:23:35.117 --> 00:23:37.842\ndownloaded one from the Internet or\nlicensed one from somewhere, and\n\n470\n00:23:37.842 --> 00:23:39.018\nyou can drop it right in here.\n\n471\n00:23:39.018 --> 00:23:41.625\nThe nice part here is you don't have\nto care about where the library is.\n\n472\n00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:43.093\nYou don't have to go and find that folder.\n\n473\n00:23:43.093 --> 00:23:45.849\nYou just throw the font in here,\nAnd then it's done.\n\n474\n00:23:45.849 --> 00:23:49.114\nBy using FontBook,\nit helps you avoid duplicate fonts, right?\n\n475\n00:23:49.114 --> 00:23:51.994\nSometimes you'll download these fonts from\nthe internet, and it'll be the same font\n\n476\n00:23:51.994 --> 00:23:54.630\nyou've already got, but they've renamed\nthe file so it looks different.\n\n477\n00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.030\nAnd you'll load it in here, it'll see\nit's the same, and it leaves it be.\n\n478\n00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.280\nSo the FontBook is how\nwe wanna manage that,\n\n479\n00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.500\nand that's what you'll find\nwith a lot of this stuff.\n\n480\n00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.940\nWhile I can navigate into\nthe Library folder, and\n\n481\n00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.020\nsee things, that doesn't necessarily mean\nI should, right, just because I can.\n\n482\n00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:13.060\nIf there's some GUI method for changing\na setting, I really need to use that.\n\n483\n00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:16.906\nI don't need to come in here and\nmess around with things if I can avoid it.\n\n484\n00:24:16.906 --> 00:24:19.338\nAll right, some of the other\nthings you might see Frameworks.\n\n485\n00:24:19.338 --> 00:24:24.066\nIf we've installed things like Java, Adobe\nAir, maybe some of the .NET stuff coming\n\n486\n00:24:24.066 --> 00:24:28.686\nout of Microsoft, those Frameworks will be\nadded on here to help applications run.\n\n487\n00:24:28.686 --> 00:24:31.395\nYou'll see that OS10 Fused Framework\nthat I installed,\n\n488\n00:24:31.395 --> 00:24:34.120\nit added some extra file\nsystem capabilities for me.\n\n489\n00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.220\nThat one's showing up in here,\n\n490\n00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.600\nthat's where the frameworks\nend up getting stored.\n\n491\n00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.899\nYou may or may not have a logs folder,\nodds are you do.\n\n492\n00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:44.487\nAnd so your system,\nif it's generating any log files, errors,\n\n493\n00:24:44.487 --> 00:24:45.805\nthings like the crash reporter,\n\n494\n00:24:45.805 --> 00:24:49.210\nthey'll put their information right here\ninside a log so you've got access to that.\n\n495\n00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.400\nNow normally when I come into the library,\n\n496\n00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.740\nthe folder that I care about the most\nis this guy right here, Preferences.\n\n497\n00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.330\n&gt;&gt; Hey Don, isn't this an example\nof a folder that we really don't\n\n498\n00:24:59.330 --> 00:24:59.981\nwanna mess with?\n\n499\n00:24:59.981 --> 00:25:01.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It really is.\n\n500\n00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.670\nThe Preferences folder is very tempting,\n\n501\n00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.440\nbecause it's got all the custom\nsettings for your applications.\n\n502\n00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.360\nBut you should really be modifying\nthose through the applications\n\n503\n00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.400\nthemselves, right?\n\n504\n00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.970\nIf you fire up pretty much any\nprogram you can go to the menu,\n\n505\n00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.910\nwell, here let me show you\ninstead of trying to describe it.\n\n506\n00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:21.370\nIf I take, for example, my little\ntext editor that I use, Sublime Text.\n\n507\n00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:24.180\nI can go up to my\nSublime Text menu up here and\n\n508\n00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.520\nI'll see Preferences, and I'll go and\nstart tweaking Preferences.\n\n509\n00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.220\nYou can take most applications\nthat you've got and do just that.\n\n510\n00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.700\nYou go up the applications menu name,\n\n511\n00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.370\nand you go to Preferences,\nthat's how we modify.\n\n512\n00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:38.190\nBut those are actually\ngetting stored right here.\n\n513\n00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:43.063\nWell, not necessarily,\nthis folder /Library/Preferences,\n\n514\n00:25:43.063 --> 00:25:45.417\nthose are the global settings.\n\n515\n00:25:45.417 --> 00:25:49.751\nWe also have user settings, and\nthose will be in your home folder, so\n\n516\n00:25:49.751 --> 00:25:54.480\nuser/depossess/library/preferences, that's\nwhere they'll go.\n\n517\n00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.460\nNow, the preference files themselves,\n\n518\n00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.240\neven if we wanted to mess with\nthem are stored as p list.\n\n519\n00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.670\nAnd p lists are actually binary\nfiles that you can't read,\n\n520\n00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:02.610\nthese used to be text files,\n\n521\n00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.710\nyou could just open these up and mess\naround with them, now they're binaries.\n\n522\n00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.640\nWe're gonna take a look at Preferences\nagain in another episode, and\n\n523\n00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.530\nI'll show how to convert these into text\nso you can mess them if you need to and\n\n524\n00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.110\nput them back in a binary format.\n\n525\n00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.720\nBut for right now,\nlet's just kind of leave it at,\n\n526\n00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.340\nyou don't wanna mess with this unless\nyou actually know what you're doing,\n\n527\n00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.180\nwhat you're looking to get into and\nmodify.\n\n528\n00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.375\nBut Preferences is\na pretty important folder.\n\n529\n00:26:24.375 --> 00:26:27.349\nAll right, the last one I want\nto highlight in here is not\n\n530\n00:26:27.349 --> 00:26:30.198\nnecessarily a folder that we see so\nmuch anymore, but\n\n531\n00:26:30.198 --> 00:26:34.253\nif you read troubleshooting documents\nthat are out there on the Internet for\n\n532\n00:26:34.253 --> 00:26:38.980\nworking with Apple devices,\nyou'll hear them talk about startup items.\n\n533\n00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.860\nStartup items can be stored a few\ndifferent ways and a startup item,\n\n534\n00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.110\nif you're not familiar with it,\nis when I log in to Mac OS,\n\n535\n00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:49.320\nI might have certain programs that I want\nto start and run when I log in, right?\n\n536\n00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.970\nAnd when we manipulate those\nyou're supposed to do it through\n\n537\n00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.980\nSystem Preferences,\npull up your user account, so\n\n538\n00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.190\nI'm gonna go over here to Don Pezet.\n\n539\n00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:02.300\nAnd then you have the login items option,\nand I can see if there is programs that\n\n540\n00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.380\nI've got here, and whether or not I want\nthem to run, when my system logs in.\n\n541\n00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:11.000\nSo like my unDock application, or\nDropbox, Moom, those are programs I use\n\n542\n00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.750\nevery single day, I want them running\nthe moment that I log in, right?\n\n543\n00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.450\nThere's other applications\nthat I might not want, and\n\n544\n00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.700\nyou could choose to remove\nthem from the list.\n\n545\n00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.270\nThis Hide option just hides\nthem from your menu bar up top.\n\n546\n00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:27.536\nI never use the Google Chrome icon in my\nmenu bar, so why show it, I hide that.\n\n547\n00:27:27.536 --> 00:27:32.188\nIf there wasn't something I never used its\nicon, it would make sense to go ahead and\n\n548\n00:27:32.188 --> 00:27:32.730\nhide it.\n\n549\n00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.960\nSo these are the Startup Items, that's\nnormally where I want to go to manipulate\n\n550\n00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:40.968\nthat, but they actually do have\nfolders on the drive, they're hidden.\n\n551\n00:27:40.968 --> 00:27:41.820\nIf we wanna poke around and\n\n552\n00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.540\nsee them, you actually may not have them\non your system if they aren't configured.\n\n553\n00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.840\nThese are again spots where when\nyou log into the computer or\n\n554\n00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.410\nyou launch the computer,\nthese things will start up with you.\n\n555\n00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:58.580\nFor example, inside of /Library,\nlet's see if we have it here.\n\n556\n00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.730\nIt'll just be called, there it is,\nStartupItems, so /Library/Startupitems.\n\n557\n00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.820\nThese will be Startup items that run for\n\n558\n00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:10.050\nevery user when they log into the system,\nif you look at mine, it's empty.\n\n559\n00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.410\nThat's because, technically,\nthis is a deprecated feature,\n\n560\n00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:14.290\nApple doesn't want you to use this.\n\n561\n00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:17.440\nBut, as a support professional you will\noften times be dealing with machines that\n\n562\n00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.280\nhave been upgraded from back in the days\nwhen it wasn't a deprecated feature, and\n\n563\n00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.770\nso you may be trying to figure out\nwhy is this application running?\n\n564\n00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.090\nYou're scratching your head, and you\ncan't figure out where it's coming from,\n\n565\n00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.130\nit might be this folder right here.\n\n566\n00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:32.180\nNow the one that I'm in is the global one,\n/Library/StartupItems.\n\n567\n00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.430\nThe users may have their own,\nalso, and if they do,\n\n568\n00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.650\nit would be stored in\ntheir Library folder.\n\n569\n00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:42.392\nAnd there's a system one too, and\nthe system one was originally designed for\n\n570\n00:28:42.392 --> 00:28:45.080\nApple to launch certain applications,\nthey don't use it anymore either, but\n\n571\n00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.840\nit will be /Systems/Library/StartupItems\nis the other one.\n\n572\n00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.470\nSo again, you shouldn't be using those,\n\n573\n00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:54.410\nbut there may actually be something in\nthere, so I just wanted to highlight that.\n\n574\n00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.770\nAll right, so I think that's a pretty good\nrun down of all the different files and\n\n575\n00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.150\nfolders that are kinda\nspread across the disk.\n\n576\n00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:06.510\nThe main thing I wanted to highlight here\nwas the Library folder, cuz there's so\n\n577\n00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:10.640\nmuch in there, and we're gonna revisit\nit again in a couple of future episodes.\n\n578\n00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.130\nCuz I wanna show you how\nthose p list files work, and\n\n579\n00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:14.700\nwe'll kinda see how those go.\n\n580\n00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:19.010\nBut, for the most part, a lot of these\nfolders are hidden from the users so\n\n581\n00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.870\nthey can't mess with them, so\n\n582\n00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:23.000\nthey can't cause trouble,\nwhich is what would generally happen.\n\n583\n00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.510\nBut hiding a file or\n\n584\n00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:28.280\na folder is not a true form of security,\nit's just hidden, right?\n\n585\n00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.560\nIf you really want to apply security you\nneeded to file permissions to restrict\n\n586\n00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:36.260\nwho's able to even get to it, or delete\nthe data, right, don't necessarily store.\n\n587\n00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.890\nHiding is not deleting, so always be\naware of that that when you hide,\n\n588\n00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.370\nit's just visually hidden,\nusers can still get at it.\n\n589\n00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.460\nYou'll typically wanna couple that with\npermissions to make sure that it actually\n\n590\n00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:46.300\ncan secure your data.\n\n591\n00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:50.420\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well, thank you for\nhelping us to dive a little bit deeper in\n\n592\n00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.020\ntaking a look at,\nwell unusually hidden files here.\n\n593\n00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.990\nTo be able to actually look at those and\n\n594\n00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:58.400\nto also show how we can hide and\nunhide files that are there.\n\n595\n00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.227\nAlso some of the different special types\nof folders that we're likely to encounter\n\n596\n00:30:02.227 --> 00:30:03.273\nthat are also hidden.\n\n597\n00:30:03.273 --> 00:30:04.258\nThe library files and\n\n598\n00:30:04.258 --> 00:30:08.100\nof course even that preference file\nthat we shouldn't be messing with too.\n\n599\n00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.180\nThis are all things that\na system administrator for\n\n600\n00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.450\nApple would want to make\nsure that they know about.\n\n601\n00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.320\nSo dive in there,\n\n602\n00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.030\ntake a look around a little bit more, make\nsure you understand these locations and\n\n603\n00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:20.750\nwhere do these things are gonna be, and\nthose domains, they're gonna help you too.\n\n604\n00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.160\nWell, it's a great place for\nus to also sign off.\n\n605\n00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.010\nFor ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n606\n00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:26.980\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n607\n00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.238\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more Apple\ncertified support professional for\n\n608\n00:30:31.238 --> 00:30:32.153\nMac OS

Archive file type ZIP are natively supported in the OS.  This allows us to combine multiple files into a single file and compress them too.  This is great when operability is needed when moving data between systems running different Operating System.  File Images are also natively supported (dmg) this is great if working between macOS machines.  These files are mountable and seen by the macOS as another disk drive.  Don also talks about and demonstrates how to create them.",

00:00:12.163\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.163 --> 00:00:14.400\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.250\nYou're watching the Apple Certified\nSupport Professional for Mac OS Sierra.\n\n6\n00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.120\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, today we're\ntaking a look at well, file archives and\n\n7\n00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.890\nimages.\n\n8\n00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.340\nAnd here to help us understand\nthat better is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.600\nDon welcome back to our studios.\n\n10\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.210\n&gt;&gt; And thanks for having me Ronnie,\nin this episode we're going to be taking\n\n11\n00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.770\na look like you said That\nare file archives and\n\n12\n00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.920\nimages, which are things that we deal\nwith on an increasing basis today.\n\n13\n00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.070\nIn the olden days, when you bought\nsoftware, you'd buy an application,\n\n14\n00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.830\nwhat, you'd go to the store,\nand you'd buy a box.\n\n15\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.400\nAnd it would have a floppy disk,\nor CD, or DVD inside of it, and\n\n16\n00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.120\nhad the software, and you'd copy it over.\n\n17\n00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.900\nBut those days are all but gone.\n\n18\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.280\nAnd now, when you go to the store,\n\n19\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.330\nthe only software you can\nfind anymore is tax software.\n\n20\n00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.038\nSo if you want anything else, You go\nonline, and you buy the software through\n\n21\n00:00:58.038 --> 00:01:01.990\nan app store, or through a vendor's\nwebsite, or use downloaded, or whatever.\n\n22\n00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.090\nAnd, when they do that, an application's\nmade up of a lot of stuff, right?\n\n23\n00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.580\nA lot of files and\nthings that go inside of that bundle.\n\n24\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.360\nIf you didn't watch the episode earlier,\n\n25\n00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.440\nwe talked a little bit about\nhow applications are bundles.\n\n26\n00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.040\nAnd bundles contain a lot of information.\n\n27\n00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.420\nSo let me show you as an example, here.\n\n28\n00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.630\nIf I go to my hard drive.\n\n29\n00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.780\nI'm going to go into applications.\n\n30\n00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.730\nAnd the application I talked about\nin the other episode was OpenShot.\n\n31\n00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.180\nOpenShot is a video editor.\n\n32\n00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.910\nIt's OpenSource.\n\n33\n00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:29.740\nIt's free, you can go and\n\n34\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.310\ndownload it from the OpenShot\nwebsite right now, if you want.\n\n35\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.870\nAnd if I right click on that and\n\n36\n00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.190\nchoose Show Package Contents,\n&gt;&gt; I can see\n\n37\n00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.790\neverything that's inside of it.\n\n38\n00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.470\nAnd I can navigate through and\nfind resources and framework and\n\n39\n00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.620\nall these other little files\nthat are inside of it.\n\n40\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.170\nSo it's actually a folder, not a file.\n\n41\n00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.450\nAnd when I download a folder,\nthat's really hard.\n\n42\n00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.040\nMost web browsers won't let you\ndownload a folder because it might be\n\n43\n00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.970\na thousand files.\n\n44\n00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.190\nYou have to download each one individually\nand put them back in the right spot.\n\n45\n00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.901\nThat doesn't work.\n\n46\n00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:03.137\nSo many, many years ago, 20, 30 years ago,\n\n47\n00:02:03.137 --> 00:02:08.580\nthey decided they needed a solution to\nthis and they came up with archives.\n\n48\n00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.560\nNow the original archives\ndidn't do compression.\n\n49\n00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.540\nAll the original archives did,\nwas take a bunch of files and\n\n50\n00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.360\ncombine them into one file.\n\n51\n00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.430\nThe same size, exact same size, no change\nthere, just combine them into one file,\n\n52\n00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.660\nwhen this one file, it's easy to trace,\nso I can download one file and\n\n53\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.680\nthen break it back up into the individual\nfiles once it's on my system.\n\n54\n00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.880\nThat's what the original archivers use,\nthe oldest one that still in use today\n\n55\n00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.530\nis one called TAR, and TAR stands for\nTape Archive and it was designed to\n\n56\n00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.840\ncombine files together so\nthey can then be written to cassette tape.\n\n57\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.000\nBut people still use it, to this very day.\n\n58\n00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.930\nBecause it's so good.\n\n59\n00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.310\nIt's just combining files together and\n\n60\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.780\nthen allowing us to pop them apart later\non and have access to that information.\n\n61\n00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.090\nWell, over the years,\nthat technology advanced and\n\n62\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.140\ngot to the point where not only could they\ncombine the files, multiple files into\n\n63\n00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.110\none file, they could compress them and\nmake them smaller at the same time.\n\n64\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.570\nThat was super important\nback in the dial-up days.\n\n65\n00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.753\nIf you had a dial-up modem, you might\nhave only had a 2,400 baud modem or\n\n66\n00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:14.284\nmaybe a 56k I think was\nfinally the highest limit.\n\n67\n00:03:14.284 --> 00:03:17.725\nSo moving 56 kilobytes or\nkilobits of data per second,\n\n68\n00:03:17.725 --> 00:03:21.320\nthat's not a whole lot of information,\nand so it was slow.\n\n69\n00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.740\nAnd so any time we could compress the data\nand make it smaller, all the better right?\n\n70\n00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.990\nSo in modern archives when we download\nthem they're doing both functions.\n\n71\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.820\nThey're combining multiple files into\none and they're shrinking them down and\n\n72\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.620\nmaking them smaller.\n\n73\n00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.210\nSo for example if I wanted to\nsend OpenShot to somebody,\n\n74\n00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.460\nfirst off I would just tell them to go\nto the OpenShot website and download it,\n\n75\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.720\nthat's easier, right?\n\n76\n00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.340\nOr, I can take this and\nI could create an archive out of it.\n\n77\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.270\nAnd creating an archive can be\ndone from inside of the system or\n\n78\n00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.920\nit can be done with third party software.\n\n79\n00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.630\nThere's a lot of third party software\nout there that will do this as well.\n\n80\n00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.150\nAnd so for\nexample I have a program called Entropy.\n\n81\n00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.640\nAnd Entropy is a third\nparty archive software.\n\n82\n00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.632\nI use it because it supports a bunch\nother technologies like 7Zip and RAR.\n\n83\n00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:12.230\nThese are other compression\nalgorithms that are out there.\n\n84\n00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.800\nBut the number one algorithm that's\nout there is one called ZIP.\n\n85\n00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.270\nAnd zip was created by a company called\nPKWARE, and it's supported by every\n\n86\n00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.200\noperating system that's out there,\nso zip is known as common.\n\n87\n00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.820\nAnd Mac OS has native support for\nzip archives built into it.\n\n88\n00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.490\nYou don't need third-party software.\n\n89\n00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.430\nThat Entropy software I used, it wasn't\nthe cheapest thing on the planet.\n\n90\n00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.136\nI think it was 15 or $20,\nI bought it forever ago.\n\n91\n00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:39.410\nBut zip that's built in to the OS.\n\n92\n00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.085\nWe do that free of charge.\n\n93\n00:04:41.085 --> 00:04:42.830\nRight?\nSo, if I come in here and\n\n94\n00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.560\nI go to my examples folder,\nI've got a zip file right here.\n\n95\n00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.010\nSo there were some USB drivers that\nI needed to load for a monitor that I\n\n96\n00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.280\nattached to my system and when I went to\nthe vendors website, they had it as a zip.\n\n97\n00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.420\nAnd all I have to do is double-click\non that and it's going to open it up.\n\n98\n00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.930\nAnd here I am, this isn't Entropy,\n\n99\n00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.350\nthis is the built-in archive\nfunctionality of macOS Sierra, right?\n\n100\n00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.150\nSo this is built-in.\n\n101\n00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.180\nThis has actually been built-in for\nseveral versions.\n\n102\n00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.260\nThis is not new to Sierra.\n\n103\n00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.880\nBut I can see the files and\nI see one file in here,\n\n104\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.470\nthere might be 50 files or\n1,000 files, and then I can\n\n105\n00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.810\nextract them to wherever I want them to\ngo by using the extract button here, or\n\n106\n00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.860\nI can just drag and drop, and\ntake the file out that way, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.710\nSo easy to work with these kind of\narchives, makes them take less space,\n\n108\n00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.710\nyou shrink thing down,\nit just makes life a little bit easier.\n\n109\n00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.090\nYou can also create your\nown archives if you want.\n\n110\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.170\nIf I highlight a bunch of files\nlike these, and I bring up my\n\n111\n00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.490\ncontrol click menu, I see this\noption right here, Compress 4 items.\n\n112\n00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.070\nNow when I choose Compress 4 Items,\nit's going to take those 4 items\n\n113\n00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.130\nthat I highlighted, and\nsee how it made a fifth one, Archive.zip.\n\n114\n00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.300\nIt made a zip file that contains\nthose four other ones, and\n\n115\n00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.750\nso I might want to rename this,\nlike dons_files.\n\n116\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.750\nAnd then I can take dons_files.zip and\nsend it to Ronnie,\n\n117\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.960\nor send it to whoever it is\nthat I need to send it to.\n\n118\n00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.300\nNow, a moment ago,\nI had four files in here,\n\n119\n00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.300\nand if I pull up the information we can\nadd up how much they all are, right?\n\n120\n00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.440\nI've got 4ks, pre-small 4.6 Megs,\n4.6 Megs and a 158.5 Megs.\n\n121\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.649\nSo we're looking at about 170 mega bytes\n\n122\n00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:37.446\nof data between those 4 files, right?\n\n123\n00:06:37.446 --> 00:06:41.650\nIf i take a look at the zip that i\njust made, we'll see how big it is.\n\n124\n00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.660\nSo if I take a look at the zip file and\npull it up, it's 1606 megs.\n\n125\n00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.040\nAll right,\nI didn't save a ton of space here, right?\n\n126\n00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.300\nThe reason I didn't save a ton of space\nis that most of the files that I grabbed\n\n127\n00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.550\nare already compressed.\n\n128\n00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.140\nThis DMZs,\n\n129\n00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.680\nthis zip they're already compressed\nyou can't compressed even further.\n\n130\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.400\nWell I think it'll gain I\nguess it did shrink a bit, but\n\n131\n00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.090\nthere's times when you compressing text\nfiles that they'll get super small.\n\n132\n00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.480\nThey can get really, really tight.\n\n133\n00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.420\nText compresses really well, and that's\nwhere you really start to save some space.\n\n134\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.730\nSo, that's how these archives work.\n\n135\n00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.100\nThat functionality is\nbuilt right into MAC OS.\n\n136\n00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.730\nYou don't need third-party software.\n\n137\n00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.960\nThe reason I have third party software is\nI want to support other archive formats\n\n138\n00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.810\nother than zip.\n\n139\n00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.790\nIf you're just doing zip, it's built\ninto the OS and you're good to go.\n\n140\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.700\nAnd then extraction we\nalready talked about.\n\n141\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.700\nYou just double-click on it,\nyou can extract it right out.\n\n142\n00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.580\nYou can drag and drop or use\nthe extract button, all built right in.\n\n143\n00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Don, what is the need if\nwe have zip files, what is the need for\n\n144\n00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.930\nthe image files that we're talking about?\n\n145\n00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo, you'll notice some of the other\n\n146\n00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.750\nfiles that aren't zip.\n\n147\n00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.230\nTry these dmgs, these are disc images,\nwhat Ronnie's asking about.\n\n148\n00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.610\nAnd when you download Mac software,\nit's normally distributed as a dmg.\n\n149\n00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.080\nSo, why have ZIP if you also have DMG?\n\n150\n00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.280\nWell, DMG is very flexible.\n\n151\n00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.350\nIt's a neat format because it\nbasically reflects itself as a disk.\n\n152\n00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.410\nIt's not a disk, it's really just a file.\n\n153\n00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.550\nBut we use it like a disk.\n\n154\n00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.700\nWe can mount it, we can access\nthe information that's inside of it,\n\n155\n00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.940\nmove things in and out, and so on.\n\n156\n00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.990\nMakes it really easy for\ndistributing software and so on.\n\n157\n00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.460\nBut DMGs are really only supported for\nMacOS.\n\n158\n00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.310\nSo if you're dealing\nwith Windows users and\n\n159\n00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.780\nLinux users,\nthey can't read those DMG files.\n\n160\n00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.620\nSo they work out great for\nthose of us in the Mac world.\n\n161\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.925\nBut everyone else is going to\nhate you if you send them one,\n\n162\n00:08:22.925 --> 00:08:24.320\nbecause they won't be able to open them.\n\n163\n00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.140\nSo, we use ZIP when we're going for\ncross-compatibility.\n\n164\n00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.710\nEverybody can use ZIP.\n\n165\n00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:34.380\nBut we use DMG we are at Mac because DMG's\ncan actually do little more than a zip.\n\n166\n00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:34.960\nRight?\n\n167\n00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.950\nwhen i open up a DMG, when i open up\na zip I just see the files contents and\n\n168\n00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.920\nI can choose to extract to that sat right?\n\n169\n00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.130\nBut, when i open up DMG.\n\n170\n00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.920\nIt can actually do something a little\nmore elaborate like have a pretty little\n\n171\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.090\nfolder like this with a background image,\nwith instructions on how to drag and drop.\n\n172\n00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.460\nIt can be a lot more informative,\nbecause that support is built in there.\n\n173\n00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.610\nIt's basically a disk, and\n\n174\n00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.960\nit's got these template files\nattached to it to render that.\n\n175\n00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.250\nWe don't get that with a zip.\n\n176\n00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.330\nSo, that's why when you download Mac\nsoftware, it will normally come as a DMG.\n\n177\n00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:10.530\nNow, DMG is well,\nusing them is pretty easy,\n\n178\n00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.450\ncreating them is actually\nkind of annoying.\n\n179\n00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's not the easiest thing\nin the world that create if you need to\n\n180\n00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.510\nbecause it is basically\na virtual hard drive, right?\n\n181\n00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.420\nIf you want to create one of those\nyou can, we use the Disk Utility.\n\n182\n00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.760\nSo I'm going to open up the Disk Utility.\n\n183\n00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.400\nAnd in the disk utility,\nI'm seeing my physical disk, right?\n\n184\n00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.280\nHere's my 500 gig SSD, and then right\nbeneath that, see how it says Disk Images?\n\n185\n00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.520\nAnd I've got an Apple UDIF\nread only compressed media.\n\n186\n00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.360\nThat's a dmg that's been mounted and\nit's the OpenShot\n\n187\n00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.600\ndmg that I opened just a moment ago so\nI could install that software.\n\n188\n00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.362\nSee how it shows up as a hard drive?\n\n189\n00:09:49.362 --> 00:09:51.044\nBut it's just a disk image.\n\n190\n00:09:51.044 --> 00:09:51.770\nRight?\n\n191\n00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.020\nSo it's attached here.\n\n192\n00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.460\nIf I want to create a disk\nimage like this I can do it,\n\n193\n00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.580\nI can go up here to my menu and go to\nfile, new image, and then I can create\n\n194\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:07.480\na blank image that I then load data into\nor I can create an image from a folder.\n\n195\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.800\nSo if I choose that one, image from\na folder I can browse the hard drive here,\n\n196\n00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.070\ngo to my desktop.\n\n197\n00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.808\nI'll take my examples folder and\nI'm want to choose Open and\n\n198\n00:10:16.808 --> 00:10:20.140\nit's going to build me\na DMG based on that folder.\n\n199\n00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.870\nSo as a developer, I can put all the files\nI needed to distribute right in one\n\n200\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.707\nfolder, and then I can come in here and\nbrowse that folder and I'm going to create\n\n201\n00:10:28.707 --> 00:10:34.260\nDons Files on the desktop, and\nI can choose to encrypt it or compress it.\n\n202\n00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.330\nAnd so right now it is going to be\ncompressed, and all the way I may save and\n\n203\n00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:42.200\nit's going to read that data and\nit's building Dons Files on dmg.\n\n204\n00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.560\nAnd I can now take that and\nsend it to another Mac user and\n\n205\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.630\nthey can double click on it and\nit will mount as a disk.\n\n206\n00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.180\nNow see how it's taking it a moment?\n\n207\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.350\nNot the fastest process\nto build a fake disk,\n\n208\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.540\nand so it's building that up and\nit'll finish any moment now.\n\n209\n00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.880\nNot a whole lot going on there,\nno real details.\n\n210\n00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.090\nShow details, it's white.\n\n211\n00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.700\n[LAUGH] And so\nthat'll be done here in just a second and\n\n212\n00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.470\nas soon as it's done,\nI'll see this Dons Files.dmg and\n\n213\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.090\nI'll be able to mount that to access\nthe data that's inside of it.\n\n214\n00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.200\nThere, so it just finished, and\nit didn't mount it by default, so\n\n215\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.380\nI'm going to double-click on it to mount.\n\n216\n00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.370\nAnd so there it goes mounting, and\n\n217\n00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.600\nthere's my files,\nmy files are available right there.\n\n218\n00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.590\nAnd if I look back here in Disk Utility,\nI can see that I've now got that Examples.\n\n219\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.440\nRight here mounted, and\n\n220\n00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:31.640\nI can it is using 351 megabytes of space\nand it's got some free space in it.\n\n221\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.190\nFree space it's an archive.\n\n222\n00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.040\nWell, it's a hard drive now and\n\n223\n00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.530\nhard drives have to have\na little bit of free space.\n\n224\n00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.080\nSo this one has some available.\n\n225\n00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.140\nSo there it is I have now\ncreated that DMG file.\n\n226\n00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.740\nNow, that's the easiest way to\ncreate a DMG file, is that you\n\n227\n00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.170\nalready have a folder, that is a populated\nexactly the way that you wanted and\n\n228\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.300\nthen you use that as\nthe source to create the DMG.\n\n229\n00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.130\nI could create an empty DMG though,\nand throw data into it.\n\n230\n00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.470\nThe one that I just made is read-only.\n\n231\n00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.080\nSee, read-only, I can't add stuff to it.\n\n232\n00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.270\nSo if I want to create one that I can\nadd things to, we go back up to our\n\n233\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:10.578\nfile menu and we choose New Image and this\ntime I'm going to choose to create a oops.\n\n234\n00:12:10.578 --> 00:12:13.222\nI'm going to choose a new blank image\nwhich is what I'm trying to do.\n\n235\n00:12:13.222 --> 00:12:15.620\nThere you go, a new blank image.\n\n236\n00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.170\nWhen you create a new blank image, it\ndoesn't know what you want to put in it.\n\n237\n00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:23.910\nSo when I come in here and\nI say that this going to be Don's files 2.\n\n238\n00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.270\nI went in on the desktop.\n\n239\n00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.460\nI need to tell it how big to make it.\n\n240\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.690\nAnd this is where it gets\na little challenging.\n\n241\n00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.020\nIt's a hard drive, so\nit has to have a size.\n\n242\n00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.750\nHow big do we make it?\n\n243\n00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.660\nIf we had chosen a source folder,\nit would look at the source folder and\n\n244\n00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.240\nfigure out how big it needed to make it.\n\n245\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.830\nBut for me, I need to look at it and\nsay all right, well, I don't know.\n\n246\n00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.690\nI might have a gig of data\nthat's going to go in there, so\n\n247\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.090\nI need to make it 1,000 megabytes.\n\n248\n00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.790\nSo I'll go ahead and specify that.\n\n249\n00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.490\nAnd what title do I want it to have?\n\n250\n00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.460\nWell, my other one was called examples.\n\n251\n00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.360\nOnce you mount it this is\nwhat it will show up as.\n\n252\n00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.320\nSo we've got the file name itself,\nthe DMG, and\n\n253\n00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.160\nthen when it mounts what\ndoes it show up as?\n\n254\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.150\nSo the file name, I might even want to\nkeep that simple, like dons_files_2.\n\n255\n00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.610\nAnd not use spaces, because I might have\na problem attaching that to an email.\n\n256\n00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:12.050\nIf you have a space in a file name,\nit's always hard to attach it.\n\n257\n00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.390\nBut in the name when its mounted,\n\n258\n00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.890\nI might want to call it Don's Files 2\nwith apostrophes and spaces and all that.\n\n259\n00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:23.040\nI can specify the format, it is a hard\ndrive so it's going to have a format.\n\n260\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.770\nMac OS Extended Journal, this is\nthe default, but you can format it for\n\n261\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.460\nother file systems.\n\n262\n00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.630\nThe idea here being that, hey,\n\n263\n00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.130\nif I'm going to share this\nwith a Windows machine,\n\n264\n00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.730\nI'm might want to make it\nlook like a FAT drive.\n\n265\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.120\nBut, Windows can't mount DMGs anyway,\nso you don't normally worry about it.\n\n266\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.800\nJust stick with\nMac OS Extended (Journaled).\n\n267\n00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.300\nThen I can do Encryption,\nPartitions, right?\n\n268\n00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.970\nIt's a fake hard drive,\nit can have partitions,\n\n269\n00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.660\nalthough we don't normally\nbother with it at that point.\n\n270\n00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.680\nThen the last one is the image format.\n\n271\n00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.430\nNow this ones kind of important.\n\n272\n00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.650\nIt's defaulting to\na read/write disk image, and\n\n273\n00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.030\nat first glance that sounds\nexactly like what I want.\n\n274\n00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:54.950\nI want to make a writable disc.\n\n275\n00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.250\nHere's the problem.\n\n276\n00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:00.040\nIf I tell it that it's going to\nbe 1 GB in size when it makes it,\n\n277\n00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.060\nit's going to be 1GB in size.\n\n278\n00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.710\nEven though it's empty,\nit will still be 1 gigabyte in size.\n\n279\n00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.376\nIt's going to be hard to email that,\nright?\n\n280\n00:14:07.376 --> 00:14:09.600\nOr send it along it's big.\n\n281\n00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:15.410\nSo I might want it to start empty and\ngrow as I put data into it.\n\n282\n00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:19.010\nThat is technically what's\ncalled a sparse disk.\n\n283\n00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.160\nA sparse disk, if you come in here and\nlook, I'll expand that.\n\n284\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.740\nI've got a sparse bundle disc image or\na sparse disc image.\n\n285\n00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.560\nThese are ones that grow\nas we put data into them.\n\n286\n00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.970\nSo if they have empty space, the empty\nspace doesn't actually occupy disc space.\n\n287\n00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.600\nAnd that's usually what we\nwant when we make these.\n\n288\n00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.420\nWhen I chose to use a folder as my source.\n\n289\n00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.400\nIt was able to look at the folder,\nfigure out the size, and\n\n290\n00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.320\nadjust it right here and\nset it to exactly what I need it to be.\n\n291\n00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.060\nBut if I don't know what the size is\ngoing to be, this is problematic.\n\n292\n00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.780\nSo instead,\nI need to switch that to a sparse disk.\n\n293\n00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.730\nNow, a sparse bundle disk image,\n\n294\n00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.630\nis one that usually going to\nbe a package application.\n\n295\n00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:01.140\nBut if just my file, i can choose to\ndo a straight up and run that way and\n\n296\n00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.920\nit will build it out, it's not going\nto have a fancy little menu or\n\n297\n00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.720\nanything like that but i'll have\nthe file that i need right there.\n\n298\n00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.470\nSo to shrink thing down a good bet,\ni'll go ahead just do a image.\n\n299\n00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:16.320\nNow, as soon i did that say i change my\nsize down to a 100 Mb it kind of reset it.\n\n300\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.680\nI can go and\nput that back to a gig if I want.\n\n301\n00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.840\nThis is effectively\ngoing to be the maximum.\n\n302\n00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.390\nIt will grow up to that maximum.\n\n303\n00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.680\nAnd you can set it even higher\nif you want it to allow more and\n\n304\n00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.330\nmore content to go in there.\n\n305\n00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.610\nAll right, but I'll go ahead and\njust hit Save.\n\n306\n00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.240\nAnd it's going to make that a DMG.\n\n307\n00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.640\nNow this DMG is empty, so\nit will happen pretty fast.\n\n308\n00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.740\nAnd if I go look at my desktop,\nI can see Don's files too, right there.\n\n309\n00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.750\nAnd it's already mounted it for me,\nexcept instead of showing as read only\n\n310\n00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.700\nlike these other guys,\nthis one shows as just sparse disk Media.\n\n311\n00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.040\nThere it is.\nIt's an image from an external disk,\n\n312\n00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.530\nit's one gig in size.\n\n313\n00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.420\nAnd right now it's empty.\n\n314\n00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.630\nAnd so I can come in here and\nI can take my files, so\n\n315\n00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.770\nif I go into my Examples folder, and\nI'll take all this stuff which I think\n\n316\n00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:07.550\nwe said was a good bit more data now\nbecause I have the archive in there.\n\n317\n00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.150\nAnd so we've got about 320 megs of data or\nsomething like that.\n\n318\n00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:15.650\nI can go into Don's Files 2,\nand I can paste that in there.\n\n319\n00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:21.710\nI'm using it as a disk because it,\nit's used as a disk by the system.\n\n320\n00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:22.990\nSo I'm copying that information in there,\n\n321\n00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.400\nwhen I go back to my Disk Utility,\nwell, the screen hasn't refreshed yet.\n\n322\n00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:26.990\nbut in a moment,\n\n323\n00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:31.480\nit'll refresh to show that we've\nnow consumed more of that space.\n\n324\n00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:36.310\nWhen you write with file system in Mac OS\nsometimes it is a little slow to update.\n\n325\n00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.380\nSo I have to give it a minute\nbefore that shows up.\n\n326\n00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.140\nBut my data's in there.\n\n327\n00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.930\nAnd I can close that.\n\n328\n00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:43.030\nAnd I can unmount it.\n\n329\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:47.230\nAnd when I unmount it,\nthe DMG file will now be that size.\n\n330\n00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.690\nAnd in fact, now that I say it,\nnow that the words are out of my mouth,\n\n331\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.995\nIt might not have updated,\nbecause I haven't unmounted it yet.\n\n332\n00:16:52.995 --> 00:16:54.880\nBecause it's allowing me to add and\nremove things.\n\n333\n00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.500\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nun-mount that by dragging it to the trash.\n\n334\n00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.800\nAnd so that's going to happen.\n\n335\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.800\nAnd yeah,\nsee how it's stalling right there.\n\n336\n00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.470\nSo, now it's actually writing to the DMG.\n\n337\n00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.640\nSo I was working with\na temporary version of it.\n\n338\n00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.780\nIt's gonna write to the DMG,\nand as soon as it's done.\n\n339\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.270\nThen we'll be ready to rock and\nif I look at my desktop here,\n\n340\n00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.680\nI think my head's over some of this.\n\n341\n00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.520\nThis is the actual file that I made,\ndons-file-2 and\n\n342\n00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:25.820\ninstead of being .dmg I can\nsee that it is .sparseimage.\n\n343\n00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:26.320\nRight?\n\n344\n00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.990\nNow that's weird, you're not going to find\na lot of people itching to download a file\n\n345\n00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.530\nthat ends in .sparseimage.\n\n346\n00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:31.590\nYou can actually rename that,\n\n347\n00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.960\nyou can actually call that\n.dmg if you want, like that.\n\n348\n00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.560\nAnd the operating system will treat it as\na sparse disk, without messing with you.\n\n349\n00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.800\nSo, you can rename that,\nI'll tell it that I want to, and\n\n350\n00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.220\nthat makes life a little easier on you.\n\n351\n00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.580\nBut at this point,\nit's got my files inside of it and\n\n352\n00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.940\nif I double click on it,\nit's going to melt that back in.\n\n353\n00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.240\nThere's my files and\n\n354\n00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.410\nif I go back to my disk utility, let's see\nif it's refreshed this time, there we go.\n\n355\n00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:00.360\nNow I can come in and it shows that\nwhile I have a gigabyte of space,\n\n356\n00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.150\nI'm only using 366 megs of it.\n\n357\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:09.060\nAnd if I do a get info on the DMG\nfile itself, and take a look at it.\n\n358\n00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.990\nIt's occupying 372 megs, which is close\nenough to 366 to be accurate for me.\n\n359\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.551\nSo, don't worry, just the amount of space,\n\n360\n00:18:16.551 --> 00:18:20.900\nit's not taking the full gigabyte that\na non-sparse image would have taken.\n\n361\n00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:26.180\nAll right, let's see,\nwhat else do I need to mention on this?\n\n362\n00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.270\nBe aware that when you\ncreate the image manually,\n\n363\n00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:32.320\nthere's a lot of features you can use\nlike partitions and file system formats.\n\n364\n00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.847\nBut you're typically\nnot going to use those.\n\n365\n00:18:35.847 --> 00:18:39.360\nI can't really think of a good use case\nscenario for partitioning one of these.\n\n366\n00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.970\nYou can always create more than\none volume if you needed to.\n\n367\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.260\nBut there's really just\nnot a lot of use for that.\n\n368\n00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.500\nBut you can create these pretty easy.\n\n369\n00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.190\nIt's all built into Mac OS, just\nremember as far as picking an archive,\n\n370\n00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.990\nif you're working with non Mac users,\nyou'll want to stick with zips.\n\n371\n00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:57.300\nZips are the way to go.\n\n372\n00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.420\nBut if it's just in Mac land,\nyou can use DMGs, they work great,\n\n373\n00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.090\nthey're built into the OS and\nnot too hard.\n\n374\n00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.180\nZips are easier to use, so\n\n375\n00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.610\nI usually use zips unless it's\nsomething that I know I'm gonna try and\n\n376\n00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.370\nLike boot farmer or distribute software,\nthat's when I'll use DMGs.\n\n377\n00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.740\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well thank you for\n\n378\n00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.990\nhelping us out to understand a little bit\nmore about these different file archives,\n\n379\n00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:23.110\nthese zips, as well as the DMG files that\nwe also had for the different images, and\n\n380\n00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:27.560\nalso showing us how to create them too,\nand thank you also for watching.\n\n381\n00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.800\nThat's a great place for\nus to sign off then.\n\n382\n00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.980\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n383\n00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:33.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n384\n00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:38.385\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more Apple\ncertified support professional for\n\n385\n00:19:38.385 --> 00:19:39.365\nMac OS

00:00:11.715\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:13.556\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:15.980\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.960\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, well,\n\n7\n00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.080\nwe're coming back at you with\nmore of our ACSP series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.470\nAnd joining us in the studio again\ntoday is our good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.510\nDon we're glad to have you again today,\nhow's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.424\n&gt;&gt; I am excited because we're\nready to do some time traveling.\n\n11\n00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:32.664\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You have a DeLorean?\n\n12\n00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:34.900\n&gt;&gt; We need a DeLorean.\n\n13\n00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.833\nI tried to get it, the budget for\nthe show was limited yeah.\n\n14\n00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:39.470\nInstead I got a USB hard drive.\n\n15\n00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.375\n&gt;&gt; Maybe next year, right?\n\n16\n00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:41.401\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n17\n00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:46.060\nin this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at Time Machine which is a really,\n\n18\n00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.599\nreally amazingly powerful backup solution\nthat is built right into Mac OS.\n\n19\n00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:53.060\nAnd most of you are already\nfamiliar with it.\n\n20\n00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.210\nFor those of you who aren't,\nyou really should be.\n\n21\n00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.250\nBecause I cannot name an easier backup\nsolution out there than Time Machine.\n\n22\n00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.949\nI work with a lot of operating systems,\nI work in the Linux world,\n\n23\n00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.030\nin the Windows world or the Mac OS world.\n\n24\n00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.330\nAnd out of all of them, none of them\nare as easy to maintain backups for\n\n25\n00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.180\nthan Mac OS.\n\n26\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.130\nBecause the Time Machine system is\nintegrated into the operating system and\n\n27\n00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.430\nit's designed to be easy.\n\n28\n00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.370\nThey really achieved their\ngoals with this one.\n\n29\n00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Don I would definitely say that\nthe Apple motto we've kind of like poked\n\n30\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.610\na little bit of fun at it from\ntime to time, of it just works.\n\n31\n00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.015\nThis is definitely one of those times\nwhere the people at Apple have made\n\n32\n00:01:28.015 --> 00:01:29.388\nsomething that just works.\n\n33\n00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:32.850\nYou turn it on and hey,\nyou're backing stuff up.\n\n34\n00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.075\nIt's very, very simple.\n\n35\n00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:38.294\nAlthough ,very powerful and\neffective in the way that it works, Don,\n\n36\n00:01:38.294 --> 00:01:41.900\nwhen it comes to backing up,\nyou're right, I'm with you.\n\n37\n00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.450\nI've never seen any\neasier solution to use.\n\n38\n00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.560\nThat being said, if the good folks\nout there have never seen them before\n\n39\n00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.200\nthey might be going well okay,\nlead us to the mountain top.\n\n40\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.430\nHow do we work with this thing,\nI wanna use it now so\n\n41\n00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.930\nlet's begin with how do we\nenable using Time Machine.\n\n42\n00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.100\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the cool thing\nabout Time Machine is that Apple,\n\n43\n00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.560\nthey made an assumption.\n\n44\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.090\nThey made the assumption that most\nusers don't care about backups.\n\n45\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.910\nAnd they're right.\n\n46\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.770\nIt's not really much of an assumption.\n\n47\n00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.070\nThey also made the assumption that\nmost people aren't gonna remember to\n\n48\n00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.390\ndo the backups because they\ndon't care about them.\n\n49\n00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.090\nSo they tried to create\na solution that you set up, and\n\n50\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.080\nthen you kinda just forget about it.\n\n51\n00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.940\nAnd just let it do its thing and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n52\n00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.260\nAnd to that regard, they've\nactually achieved that pretty well.\n\n53\n00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.454\nSo we just need to get it set up and from\nthat point on, there's not a whole heck of\n\n54\n00:02:26.454 --> 00:02:29.210\na lot you have to do to it to\nkeep it up and happy and healthy.\n\n55\n00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.910\nSo getting it turned on is as easy\n\n56\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.170\nas adding some additional\nstorage to your device.\n\n57\n00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.300\nNow, when you do a backup you need to\nbe backing up to another hard drive.\n\n58\n00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.500\nAnd it could be a second hard\ndrive inside of your computer.\n\n59\n00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.970\nIf you've got a Mac Mini or\na Mac Pro, there's room in there.\n\n60\n00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.370\nYou can add a second drive.\n\n61\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.820\nIt could be to a external drive.\n\n62\n00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.240\nIf you have a MacBook or an iMac, there's\nno extra room in them for other storage.\n\n63\n00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.860\nYou can add a USB or Thunderbolt\nhard drive, you plug that in and\n\n64\n00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.460\nnow you've got extra storage.\n\n65\n00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.850\nAnd once that extra storage is there,\nyou can now back up to it.\n\n66\n00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.830\nNow which is better?\n\n67\n00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.980\nIt kinda depends on what\nyour use case scenario is.\n\n68\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.965\nIf you're just worried about occasionally\naccidentally deleting a file or having to\n\n69\n00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:13.507\nerase your computer and restore it,\nmaybe you do a warranty replacement and\n\n70\n00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:17.190\nthey change out the hard drive, and\nyou just wanna get your data back.\n\n71\n00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.810\nWell, in those scenarios an internal\nhard drive is just as good as\n\n72\n00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.778\nan external hard drive.\n\n73\n00:03:21.778 --> 00:03:24.490\nAnd if it's internal, you have the added\nbenefit of not having to worry about\n\n74\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.910\naccidentally unplugging it or\n\n75\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.800\nsomebody stealing it or whatever,\nit's inside of the computer.\n\n76\n00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.490\nOn a negative side,\n\n77\n00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.340\nif your office were to burn down,\nwell you lose your main hard drive and\n\n78\n00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.820\nyour Time Machine hard drive because\nthey were both right there side by side.\n\n79\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.866\nSo external storage is\nusually the better option.\n\n80\n00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:44.090\nWhen we back up to external storage,\n\n81\n00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.600\nUSB storage like what I've got on my\nlaptop is a little USB hard drive.\n\n82\n00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.590\nAnd with it, what you can do is you\ncan back Time Machine up to it, and\n\n83\n00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.340\nI'm just ejecting it so\nI can kinda hold it up here on the screen.\n\n84\n00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.580\nSo I've got this USB hard drive.\n\n85\n00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.370\nIt's got the traditional\nUSB 3.0 interface, but\n\n86\n00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.140\nyou can get them with USB-C,\nand you can get Thunderbolt.\n\n87\n00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.225\nDaniel, you use the Thunderbolt one,\nright?\n\n88\n00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:05.025\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n89\n00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:09.744\n&gt;&gt; So we've got a few different options\nthat are out there, as far as speed,\n\n90\n00:04:09.744 --> 00:04:10.300\nright?\n\n91\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.410\nUSB 3.0 is pretty fast, it is good enough.\n\n92\n00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.120\nThunderbolt is obviously\ngonna be the fastest.\n\n93\n00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.040\nAnd then USBC is typically comparable\nto Thunderbolt depending on which\n\n94\n00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.790\nmodel of laptop you have.\n\n95\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.600\nBut by having a removable media like this,\nyou get two benefits, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.342\nThe first benefit is that I can take\nthis disk, I can plug it in and\n\n97\n00:04:31.342 --> 00:04:35.270\nback up to it and I can unplug the disk,\nand I can take it somewhere else.\n\n98\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.080\nI can have an off site backup.\n\n99\n00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.470\nIf this is my home computer, I might take\na back up and then leave it at the office,\n\n100\n00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.410\nleave this little drive at the office,\nor the other way around, right?\n\n101\n00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.270\nI could back up my office computer and\nleave this little drive at home.\n\n102\n00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.710\nThe only problem with doing an off\nsite backup like this is that,\n\n103\n00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.170\nI have to remember to bring it back\nto plug it in to do the backup.\n\n104\n00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.120\nAnd remember Apple's assumption that\nmost people aren't going to remember\n\n105\n00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.930\nto do backups, that's not likely.\n\n106\n00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.400\nSo some people will just plug it in and\nleave it there and\n\n107\n00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.990\nit backs up and there you go.\n\n108\n00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.240\nMine I normally leave attached to\nmy docking station in my office.\n\n109\n00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.504\nAnd that way when I come into the office\nand I sit down and I plug in my MacBook,\n\n110\n00:05:10.504 --> 00:05:12.090\nit backs itself up.\n\n111\n00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.530\nAnd then when I take my laptop and\nI leave,\n\n112\n00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.330\nthe backup drive stays here at the office,\nand now my laptop's out there with me.\n\n113\n00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.730\nIf somebody steals my laptop or\nI lose it at the airport or whatever,\n\n114\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.400\nI know this backup is sitting back in\nmy office right where I can get to it.\n\n115\n00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.800\nThe other advantage of removable media\nis that you can have more than one.\n\n116\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.250\nI can buy two hard drives and\n\n117\n00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.210\nI can have one that I plug in to my\ncomputer while I take the other one home.\n\n118\n00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.360\nAnd the next day I come in and\nswap them out or\n\n119\n00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.370\nonce a week I swap them out or whatever.\n\n120\n00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.480\nSo now you've always get one off site and\none on site, you can have more than one.\n\n121\n00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.330\nIn a Mac Pro and in an iMac, or,\nnot an iMac, sorry, a Mac Mini.\n\n122\n00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.900\nYou've only got room to\nadd one extra hard drive.\n\n123\n00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.520\nIn an iMac, in a MacBook Pro, or\n\n124\n00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.370\neven a MacBook Air, you don't have\nroom to add any extra hard drives.\n\n125\n00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.460\nSo the internal option is not\neven an option for you, right?\n\n126\n00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.630\nThere is a third option\nthat's available though.\n\n127\n00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.790\nInstead of backing up to\na drive right on your system\n\n128\n00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.450\nyou can back to a Time Machine sever.\n\n129\n00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.310\nAnd there's a two different\ntypes of Time machine servers.\n\n130\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.430\nThere's the time capsule which is\n\n131\n00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.380\nbasically a router type\ndevice that Apple sells.\n\n132\n00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.990\nIt has a wireless access point built\nin to it and it's got hard drives.\n\n133\n00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.472\nI think it stores two\ndifferent hard drives,\n\n134\n00:06:19.472 --> 00:06:20.923\nyou can put two terabytes\nstorage in there.\n\n135\n00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:25.011\nAnd now whenever your computer jumps on\nthe network, it sees that time capsule and\n\n136\n00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:27.035\nit backs up to it, that's kind of nice.\n\n137\n00:06:27.035 --> 00:06:29.650\nYou walk into your home,\nyou're on the wireless, and it backs up.\n\n138\n00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.450\nIn an enterprise though,\n2 TB is not enough storage and so\n\n139\n00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.550\nyou can set up a Time Machine server.\n\n140\n00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.410\nAnd a Time Machine server is a machine\nthat is running Mac OS X server and\n\n141\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.250\nit's creating a network share that's\nvisible for people to back up to.\n\n142\n00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.256\nSo I wanna walk you guys through\nthat process of getting set up and\n\n143\n00:06:48.256 --> 00:06:51.206\nkinda connecting to these different\ntypes of destinations and\n\n144\n00:06:51.206 --> 00:06:52.500\ngetting the backup set up.\n\n145\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.720\nI will tell you,\nin a business environment,\n\n146\n00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.200\nyou definitely wanna go with\nthe Time Machine server, right?\n\n147\n00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.880\nAnd there's a few reasons for that, but\n\n148\n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.312\nthe main ones are that you're\ngonna need a lot of storage.\n\n149\n00:07:01.312 --> 00:07:03.970\nAnd so removable media is not gonna\ngive you enough storage to handle all\n\n150\n00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.620\nthe various computers in your business.\n\n151\n00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.460\nYou're going to need a SAN or something.\n\n152\n00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.970\nAnd so you'll want a machine\nrunning Mac OS X server and\n\n153\n00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.480\nrunning Xsan connected to\na large amount of storage.\n\n154\n00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.290\nAnd then the second reason is,\nas an administrator,\n\n155\n00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.760\nyou need access to everybody's backups,\nright?\n\n156\n00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.530\nSo if Tom in accounting loses his laptop\nwho is gonna have to restore that backup?\n\n157\n00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.790\nYou are, right, as the IT administrator.\n\n158\n00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.840\nSo you need access to the backups.\n\n159\n00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.442\nAnd if they are all in one central\nlocation like on a Time Machine server,\n\n160\n00:07:31.442 --> 00:07:34.135\nyou can just go right there and\nget the backups and use them to restore.\n\n161\n00:07:34.135 --> 00:07:35.970\nIt makes life a heck of a lot easier.\n\n162\n00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.010\nSo Time Machine servers are pretty handy,\nand\n\n163\n00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.690\nthey're really not that hard to set up.\n\n164\n00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.890\nI'll show you guys just\nkind of a quick rundown.\n\n165\n00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.660\nNow on the exam they want you to know that\nyou can back up to a Time Machine server.\n\n166\n00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.610\nThey don't expect you to actually\nset up the Time Machine server, but\n\n167\n00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.563\nit's super easy,\nI'll show you how to do it.\n\n168\n00:07:49.563 --> 00:07:53.181\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if they've done anything like\nthey've done for our desktop solution.\n\n169\n00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.013\nIt's point and click.\n\n170\n00:07:54.013 --> 00:07:55.565\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not bad.\n\n171\n00:07:55.565 --> 00:07:59.222\n&gt;&gt; Almost interesting is like, what you\nmake it sounds like, it is like a direct\n\n172\n00:07:59.222 --> 00:08:03.030\ncompetitor to enterprise solutions\nto something like Backup Exec.\n\n173\n00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.824\nSymantec, I mean, is it on that level?\n\n174\n00:08:04.824 --> 00:08:06.600\n&gt;&gt; Not quite.\n\n175\n00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.057\nSo, Symantec, Backup Exec, or ComVault or\nthere's these products out there,\n\n176\n00:08:10.057 --> 00:08:12.981\nthey cost thousands, tens of\nthousands of dollars, in some cases.\n\n177\n00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:15.473\nAnd they have Mac clients\nthat you can reach out and\n\n178\n00:08:15.473 --> 00:08:17.320\nback up your max with that software.\n\n179\n00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.470\nWhat that software has is really\ngreat centralized reporting.\n\n180\n00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.060\nSo if a backup fails that kind\nof software will tell you,\n\n181\n00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.180\nhey, Daniel's laptop hasn't backed up\nin five days, and the backup's failed.\n\n182\n00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.749\nWe don't see that with Time Machine.\n\n183\n00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:32.380\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n184\n00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.690\n&gt;&gt; With Time Machine,\nevery client manages their own backup.\n\n185\n00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.220\nSo in theory, you could turn off\nTime Machine on your laptop.\n\n186\n00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.800\n&gt;&gt; And\nthe central management would never know.\n\n187\n00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.650\n&gt;&gt; We wouldn't know, yep.\n\n188\n00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.350\nCuz at the central management side,\nit's really just a shared folder.\n\n189\n00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.870\nSo, there is a use case scenario for\n\n190\n00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.870\nthose more expensive\nproducts that are out there.\n\n191\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.860\nBut for most people, you'll find where\nTime Machine actually suits your needs and\n\n192\n00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.010\nyou get the data backed up that you want.\n\n193\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.510\nAll right,\nlet's take a look at getting this set up.\n\n194\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.190\nSo I've got a macOS Sierra\nmachine sitting right here.\n\n195\n00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.650\nAnd it's a fresh install.\n\n196\n00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.850\nI think I just installed the VMware Tools\non it, and that's about it.\n\n197\n00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.124\nSo nothing too crazy has\nbeen done on this machine.\n\n198\n00:09:03.124 --> 00:09:06.570\nAnd I want to get it set up for\nTime Machine.\n\n199\n00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.000\nAnd actually in a previous episode, we\ncreated a user on this one Samantha Jones\n\n200\n00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.740\nor something like that, so\nwe have another user on here.\n\n201\n00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.180\nBut I wanna set up a back\nup to this machine.\n\n202\n00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.320\nSo the first thing I need to do is\nfigure where I'm gonna back up to,\n\n203\n00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.160\nand in my case, I've added a second\nhard drive to this system.\n\n204\n00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.100\nNow the hard drive is formatted,\nso is not showing up yet.\n\n205\n00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:29.170\nBut any time you plug in a new hard\ndrive into macOS, it'll detect it,\n\n206\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.740\nand it'll prompt you and say,\ndo you wanna use this for Time Machine?\n\n207\n00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.929\nSo it actually makes it really easy,\nright?\n\n208\n00:09:32.929 --> 00:09:36.610\nIn my case, the drive's not formatted\nthough so it's unhappy about it.\n\n209\n00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.690\nSo I'm gonna fire up the Disk Utility.\n\n210\n00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.899\nAnd, when I get into the Disk Utility,\nI'll see that drive.\n\n211\n00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.010\nAnd I just need to format it really quick.\n\n212\n00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.740\nSo I'm gonna erase it,\nand I will give it a name.\n\n213\n00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.390\nNow I'm gonna call it Time Machine,\nbecause I just wanna remember that's what\n\n214\n00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.120\nI'm using it for, right,\nyou can call it whatever you want.\n\n215\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.560\nThe name doesn't actually matter.\n\n216\n00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.750\nBut what does matter is the format.\n\n217\n00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.532\nIt needs to be macOS Extended Journaled.\n\n218\n00:10:01.532 --> 00:10:04.127\nOr macOS Extended Journaled case\nsensitive, it'll be fine too.\n\n219\n00:10:04.127 --> 00:10:07.570\nBut it definitely needs\nto be macOS Extended.\n\n220\n00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.175\nAnd that's because the way Time Machine\nstores the files and references them and\n\n221\n00:10:12.175 --> 00:10:15.289\npulls them back,\nit's making use of Mac aliases, and\n\n222\n00:10:15.289 --> 00:10:19.572\nthose aliases don't work on FAT32 and\nNTFS and other formats like that.\n\n223\n00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:23.420\nSo, we need to make sure that\nit's macOS Extended Journaled.\n\n224\n00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.410\nSo I'm gonna go in and erase that disc.\n\n225\n00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.820\nAnd as soon as it does it,\nit's just erasing it.\n\n226\n00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.200\nAnd now it shows us a blank disc.\n\n227\n00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.250\nI just plugged a blank\ndisc into my computer.\n\n228\n00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.290\nAnd immediately, I get this pop-up, right?\n\n229\n00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.384\nDo you wanna use Time Machine?\n\n230\n00:10:36.384 --> 00:10:38.442\nThat's the name I gave that disc.\n\n231\n00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:42.632\nIt's 1.07 terabytes to\nback up with Time Machine.\n\n232\n00:10:42.632 --> 00:10:45.090\nAll right, if I want to use it,\n\n233\n00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.774\nI click this users backup disk button,\nand I'm done.\n\n234\n00:10:48.774 --> 00:10:51.312\n[CROSSTALK] And you walk away and it\nstarts the first backup and off it goes.\n\n235\n00:10:51.312 --> 00:10:55.800\nSo I'm not gonna do that, because I\nwanna show you guys the steps involved.\n\n236\n00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.112\nBut it's really that easy.\n\n237\n00:10:57.112 --> 00:10:57.661\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n238\n00:10:57.661 --> 00:10:59.180\n&gt;&gt; Like you plug in the drive.\n\n239\n00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.410\nAnd then what happens is,\nlet's pretend I press that button and\n\n240\n00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.230\nwe go the easy route, okay.\n\n241\n00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.000\nIt starts a two minute timer.\n\n242\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.950\nAnd I wish I could tell you why,\nI don't know why, but\n\n243\n00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.530\nit starts a two minute timer.\n\n244\n00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.340\nAnd after two minutes,\nit starts the first backup.\n\n245\n00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.660\nAnd so it runs the first backup.\n\n246\n00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:19.620\nAnd the first backup is an entire\ncopy of the data on your system.\n\n247\n00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.930\nSo everything, the operating system,\nyour files, your data files,\n\n248\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:27.950\nyour applications, all of it gets\nbacked up to the USB drive or\n\n249\n00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.290\nwhatever drive it is that you've chosen.\n\n250\n00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:35.450\nAnd then after that,\nonce an hour it kicks in, and\n\n251\n00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:40.450\nit backs up just the things that\nhave changed in that hour, right?\n\n252\n00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.423\nSo my initial backup takes ten minutes and\nthen it finishes.\n\n253\n00:11:42.423 --> 00:11:45.945\nAfter that every hour it kicks in it\njust gets changes which will probably\n\n254\n00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:50.350\ntake less than a minute, two minutes tops\nto get what changed it goes pretty quick.\n\n255\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.390\nAnd it's constantly doing that, and\n\n256\n00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.620\nit stores those back ups on\nthe disk until the disk gets full.\n\n257\n00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.516\nAnd when the disk gets full, it deletes\nold stuff to make room for new, but\n\n258\n00:11:58.516 --> 00:12:01.320\nit's always got at least one\nfull back up that's available.\n\n259\n00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.221\nSo we need to make sure whatever disk\nwe pick, is at least the same size as\n\n260\n00:12:05.221 --> 00:12:09.209\nthe disk we're backing up, but\nideally we want it to be bigger, right?\n\n261\n00:12:09.209 --> 00:12:15.440\nAnd I think my hard drive in this machine\nis 256 gigs, so this is one terabyte.\n\n262\n00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.400\nThat means, I could have four completely\ndifferent sets of data on that\n\n263\n00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.250\ndisk backed up here, and\nbefore I have to delete anything.\n\n264\n00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:23.900\nThe reality is,\n\n265\n00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.180\nthere's a lot of stuff on your hard\ndrive that doesn't change, right?\n\n266\n00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.660\nYour application files,\nthe operating system, they don't change,\n\n267\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.420\nexcept when there's updates.\n\n268\n00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.580\nIt's really just your data,\nyour documents, right?\n\n269\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.060\nSo the documents that you save,\n\n270\n00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.340\nthe bookmarks you create in your web\nbrowser, that's the stuff that changes.\n\n271\n00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.700\nAnd that takes a very,\nvery small amount of space.\n\n272\n00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.480\nSo you'll find where you can have months,\nand months, and months worth of backups,\n\n273\n00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.850\nall stored right on your Time Machine disk\njust by hitting that user backup disc.\n\n274\n00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, that were some of the\ndefault settings that we might run into\n\n275\n00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.950\nwhen it comes to, I've setup Time Machine.\n\n276\n00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:54.780\nI'm like, all right, it's going.\n\n277\n00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.230\nWhat should I expect as its\nperformance out of the gate?\n\n278\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.166\n&gt;&gt; So the main thing is that,\nit's gonna be doing those backups, right?\n\n279\n00:13:00.166 --> 00:13:03.654\nSo doing backups every hour and,\nit's pretty minimal, so\n\n280\n00:13:03.654 --> 00:13:06.070\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n281\n00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.020\nBut it does only retain data for so\nlong, cuz it has to kind of make room.\n\n282\n00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.845\nSo you'll see where it starts to kind of\ncompress things down a bit to make room.\n\n283\n00:13:14.845 --> 00:13:18.521\nIt'll do where it maintains the hourly\nbackups for the last 24 hours.\n\n284\n00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:21.848\nAnd then it does daily backups for\nthe last month.\n\n285\n00:13:21.848 --> 00:13:25.062\nAnd then it starts to do these weekly\nbackups for the things that are even older\n\n286\n00:13:25.062 --> 00:13:28.137\nto kind of consolidate that space,\nand we can tweak a lot of that, right?\n\n287\n00:13:28.137 --> 00:13:31.330\nI'm gonna choose Don't Use on this screen.\n\n288\n00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.730\nAnd, I'm gonna show you guys what\nit would be like if I went in and\n\n289\n00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.160\nset this up manually.\n\n290\n00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.090\nTo set it up manually,\nif we go up here to our Apple menu and\n\n291\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:42.210\nwe go into System Preferences, you'll\nsee a system preference that is called\n\n292\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.840\nTime Machine, it's way down here,\na little green circle with a clock in it.\n\n293\n00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.217\nAnd when I choose Time Machine,\n\n294\n00:13:47.217 --> 00:13:50.439\nI come into this screen where it allows\nme to Select my Backup Disc, right?\n\n295\n00:13:50.439 --> 00:13:52.744\nThat's what that one screen\nwas going to do for me,\n\n296\n00:13:52.744 --> 00:13:54.900\nit was selecting that new\ndisc as a backup disc.\n\n297\n00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.200\nI can Select Backup Disc and\nI can choose that Time Machine disc,\n\n298\n00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.870\nor I can choose an Airport Time Capsule.\n\n299\n00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.210\nSo if I have got one of those\nwireless access points from Apple,I\n\n300\n00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.788\ncan choose to use that.\n\n301\n00:14:05.788 --> 00:14:07.688\nBut I'm gonna choose the Time Machine.\n\n302\n00:14:07.688 --> 00:14:10.902\nAnd another thing that's\nnot quite on the exam, but\n\n303\n00:14:10.902 --> 00:14:16.030\nin real life you may wanna know, Apple\nhasn't committed to the time capsule line.\n\n304\n00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.880\nThey've actually transitioned all of the\nemployees that were working on that line\n\n305\n00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.050\nover to another product.\n\n306\n00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.590\nSo we're not certain if they're\ngonna continue working with those.\n\n307\n00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:28.150\nSo, if you haven't bought one already,\n\n308\n00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.030\nI probably wouldn't suggest going\nthe time capsule route for new stuff.\n\n309\n00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.710\nYou'd be better off taking a Mac Mini and\nsetting it up as your Time Machine server.\n\n310\n00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.448\nSo just a little side advice there.\n\n311\n00:14:36.448 --> 00:14:38.617\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose Time Machine.\n\n312\n00:14:38.617 --> 00:14:43.109\nAnd when I choose that disk, all right,\nif I had chosen just use the disk before,\n\n313\n00:14:43.109 --> 00:14:47.380\nit would've used it, and\nit would've been an unencrypted disk.\n\n314\n00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:51.460\nBut here,\nI have the option to Encrypt the Backups.\n\n315\n00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:55.395\nNow this option is only available to me\nwhen I add the disk to Time Machine, so\n\n316\n00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:59.536\nif I don't turn on encryption now,\nit's not gonna be on later either, right?\n\n317\n00:14:59.536 --> 00:15:03.988\nI'd have to turn off Time Machine for that\ndisk, and then turn it back on again and\n\n318\n00:15:03.988 --> 00:15:07.050\nit would only encrypt\nthe new backups that I took.\n\n319\n00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:11.030\nMy old backups would still\nbe on that disk unencrypted.\n\n320\n00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.320\nSo that's bad, and why is it bad?\n\n321\n00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.016\nWell, let's say that Daniel walks\ninto my office one day, and\n\n322\n00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:21.339\nhe sees my Time Machine disks sitting\nright there on my desk, and he says,\n\n323\n00:15:21.339 --> 00:15:23.457\nyoink, and takes it and runs home.\n\n324\n00:15:23.457 --> 00:15:25.302\n&gt;&gt; You know me too well.\n\n325\n00:15:25.302 --> 00:15:26.299\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n326\n00:15:26.299 --> 00:15:27.834\nwhat could you do with that disk?\n\n327\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.750\nPlug it into your computer, and\nbrowse right through it, and\n\n328\n00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.705\nnow you got all my data in a super\nconvenient portable format, right?\n\n329\n00:15:34.705 --> 00:15:35.867\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's bad.\n\n330\n00:15:35.867 --> 00:15:38.632\nWe definitely wanna make sure\nthat we turn on the encryption so\n\n331\n00:15:38.632 --> 00:15:41.036\nthat we protect the data,\nif it's a removable disk.\n\n332\n00:15:41.036 --> 00:15:45.453\nNow, if it was a disk inside my computer,\nwell, I might not worry about encryption\n\n333\n00:15:45.453 --> 00:15:49.826\nthere, because somebody would have to take\nthe computer apart to get at it right?\n\n334\n00:15:49.826 --> 00:15:51.710\nThey'd probably just\nsteal the whole computer.\n\n335\n00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:55.792\nAnd if they steal the whole computer Well,\nthey've got the original set of data,\n\n336\n00:15:55.792 --> 00:15:59.290\nnot just the backup set, so\nwe might not need to encrypt there.\n\n337\n00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.766\nBut if you've gone through the trouble to\nturn on File Vault, then it make sense.\n\n338\n00:16:03.766 --> 00:16:06.569\nAnd if it's important enough for\nyou to protect your laptop's data,\n\n339\n00:16:06.569 --> 00:16:09.060\nit's important for\nyou to protect your backups also.\n\n340\n00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.383\nSo, you'll typically want to turn on\nthat Encrypt backups option, right?\n\n341\n00:16:12.383 --> 00:16:13.820\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n342\n00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.390\nNow, when you turn on\nthe Encrypt backups option,\n\n343\n00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.130\nit's gonna have to set up\na recovery key for us.\n\n344\n00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.800\nAnd that recovery key is gonna help us\nto decrypt the data if we ever go to\n\n345\n00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.790\nanother machine.\n\n346\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.637\nOn this machine, it'll actually store\nthat recovery key as part of the or\n\n347\n00:16:27.637 --> 00:16:30.253\ninside of the TPM,\nthe Trusted Platform Module.\n\n348\n00:16:30.253 --> 00:16:31.979\nBut if we go to restore\nto another computer,\n\n349\n00:16:31.979 --> 00:16:33.762\nwe'll have to have that\nkey available to us.\n\n350\n00:16:33.762 --> 00:16:37.245\nThat's important to remember too cuz if\nyou lose the key, Apple doesn't have it,\n\n351\n00:16:37.245 --> 00:16:38.660\nit can't help you.\n\n352\n00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.443\nNow you have a perfectly good backup\nof your system and you can't get at it.\n\n353\n00:16:42.443 --> 00:16:43.430\n&gt;&gt; It's completely useless.\n\n354\n00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.610\n&gt;&gt; Might as well be deleted at that point,\nso you don't want to lose that key.\n\n355\n00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.010\nThat's always a risk\nwhen we encrypt our data.\n\n356\n00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:50.720\nSo I am gonna choose to use the disk and\n\n357\n00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.960\nbecause I chose encryption,\nnow I've got to provide a key.\n\n358\n00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.424\nAnd so I'll come in here and\npunch in a super secret password and\n\n359\n00:16:59.424 --> 00:17:00.864\nnot provide a hint.\n\n360\n00:17:00.864 --> 00:17:01.575\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n361\n00:17:01.575 --> 00:17:05.982\nthat way I will know how I can decrypt\nthat disk if I ever have a problem,\n\n362\n00:17:05.982 --> 00:17:07.943\nnobody else does, all right?\n\n363\n00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:11.900\nAnd we will choose to encrypt it,\nand off it goes.\n\n364\n00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.420\nAll right, so it's gonna prepare for\n\n365\n00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.980\nencryption and\nthen it's going to encrypt that disk.\n\n366\n00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.158\nAnd then when it's done encrypting,\nwhich, you know, the disk is empty,\n\n367\n00:17:19.158 --> 00:17:21.603\nthe encryption process really\nwon't take all that long.\n\n368\n00:17:21.603 --> 00:17:25.108\nBut when it's done,\nTime Machine is gonna be turned on, and\n\n369\n00:17:25.108 --> 00:17:27.526\nit's gonna start that two minute timer.\n\n370\n00:17:27.526 --> 00:17:30.907\nYou'll see where it'll say\n120 seconds until backup, and\n\n371\n00:17:30.907 --> 00:17:35.063\nit'll count all the way down to zero and\nthen it'll start that first backup.\n\n372\n00:17:35.063 --> 00:17:37.775\nI'm sure there's some technical reason\nwhy they wait that two minutes, but\n\n373\n00:17:37.775 --> 00:17:38.660\nwe'll see that happen.\n\n374\n00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.950\nNow while we're waiting on that,\nit's telling me the schedule right here.\n\n375\n00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:46.260\nHourly backups for the last 24 hours,\ndaily backups for the past month and\n\n376\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.870\nthen weekly backups for\nall previous months.\n\n377\n00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.510\nSo it's letting me know what to expect as\nfar as how far back my backups are gonna\n\n378\n00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:54.950\ngo, right?\n\n379\n00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.040\nAnd then if I go into my Options button,\n\n380\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.440\nyou'll see where there's a few other\nthings that we can go in here and tweak.\n\n381\n00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.010\nWe'll see the disks that\nwe can manipulate and\n\n382\n00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.790\nwhat you're choosing here is things that\nyou want to exclude from the backups.\n\n383\n00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.330\nYou might have partitions on your\ndisk that you don't care about,\n\n384\n00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.530\nthat have data that's not\nreally sensitive to you,\n\n385\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.870\nlike a scratch disk if you work in\ngraphics design or video editing.\n\n386\n00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.120\nWe normally have a scratch\ndisk that's very fast storage,\n\n387\n00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.418\ndesigned to hold things temporarily.\n\n388\n00:18:18.418 --> 00:18:20.860\nI might not wanna back that up,\nso I can exclude that.\n\n389\n00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.869\nYou'll definitely wanna exclude\nany of your Time Machine disks,\n\n390\n00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:26.350\nyou don't wanna back up\nTime Machine to Time Machine.\n\n391\n00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:30.926\nAnd then you'll see down here,\nnotify after old backups are deleted,\n\n392\n00:18:30.926 --> 00:18:33.450\nthat sounds like a good thing, right?\n\n393\n00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:34.760\nMy backup disk fills up and\n\n394\n00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.660\nthen it starts notifying me that\nit's still deleting old backups.\n\n395\n00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.759\nBut the reality is there's not much you\ncan do about it other than buy a bigger\n\n396\n00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:42.903\ndisk and\nthe notifications do get kind of annoying.\n\n397\n00:18:42.903 --> 00:18:47.495\nSo I'll usually turn that off if I want\nit to be seamless to the end user where,\n\n398\n00:18:47.495 --> 00:18:51.664\nlike in my case where I've got a 256\ngig operating system disk, and\n\n399\n00:18:51.664 --> 00:18:53.540\na 1 terabyte backup disk.\n\n400\n00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:57.871\nBy the time we start deleting old backups,\nthat means that I've more than likely got\n\n401\n00:18:57.871 --> 00:19:02.142\nyears of backups on that disk, and I'm not\nso worried about it deleting those off.\n\n402\n00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.960\nBut you can leave that on,\nit is on by default,\n\n403\n00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.073\nand you'll know any time\nthat it deletes something.\n\n404\n00:19:08.002 --> 00:19:10.888\nThe only other options that we see here,\nare Back Up Automatically,\n\n405\n00:19:10.888 --> 00:19:12.801\nwhich you generally want turned on, right?\n\n406\n00:19:12.801 --> 00:19:18.526\nSo any time it sees this disk appear,\nit's going to be backing up automatically.\n\n407\n00:19:18.526 --> 00:19:21.957\nAnd if the USB disk is disconnected,\nit doesn't try and back up, it says, nope,\n\n408\n00:19:21.957 --> 00:19:23.130\nI'm not gonna back that up.\n\n409\n00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.710\nBut we usually want that to back\nup automatically, if you don't,\n\n410\n00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.430\nyou have to come in and\nmanually do the back up.\n\n411\n00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.930\nNow you can manually do the backup by\ncoming here into System Preferences and\n\n412\n00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:35.420\ngoing into the Time Machine\nwindow here and firing it up.\n\n413\n00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.580\nI don't see the start backup button\nbecause it's actively doing something\n\n414\n00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.340\nright now, it's encrypting, right?\n\n415\n00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.720\nThe other way you can start it, though,\nis this option down here at the bottom,\n\n416\n00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.043\nShow Time Machine in menu bar.\n\n417\n00:19:45.043 --> 00:19:49.945\nAnd I always turn this on because it\nadds a little icon right up here in\n\n418\n00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:51.680\nour menu bar.\n\n419\n00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.600\nAnd you can click on it and you can see\nexactly what Time Machine is doing.\n\n420\n00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.910\nIs it backing up right now or not?\n\n421\n00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.513\nIf it is, well, how far along is it?\n\n422\n00:20:00.513 --> 00:20:04.680\nI'm 4% done encrypting that disk,\nthat's gonna take a while.\n\n423\n00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.980\nI can choose to Back Up Now, and\n\n424\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.140\nI can enter Time Machine which would\nlet me recover data out of it.\n\n425\n00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.910\nSo this let's me interact with Time\nMachine and I really like having that,\n\n426\n00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:15.880\nit really helps.\n\n427\n00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.470\nAnd I'm not going to wait for\nthis encryption to finish,\n\n428\n00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:21.300\nlet me flip over to my own laptop,\nand I'll show you my Time Machine.\n\n429\n00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:26.100\nSo this is my work laptop,\nthus the fact that I am using it, I guess,\n\n430\n00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.150\nand I'm gonna plug that USB drive back in.\n\n431\n00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.455\nAnd so we'll see here on the desktop,\n\n432\n00:20:31.455 --> 00:20:36.610\nwhat's gonna happen is that drive will\nappear over here as soon as it mounts.\n\n433\n00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:41.050\nAnd up here I've got my menu item for\nTime Machine, and it is showing up here,\n\n434\n00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:45.050\nit says the Latest Backup of\nTime Machine was Today at 9:16 AM.\n\n435\n00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.250\nWell looking at my watch it's\nabout 9:50 right now, so\n\n436\n00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.200\nit actually backed up right\nbefore this show started.\n\n437\n00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.021\nYeah, I didn't know that,\nit's just the drive was attached and\n\n438\n00:20:53.021 --> 00:20:54.365\nit happened to run the backup.\n\n439\n00:20:54.365 --> 00:20:58.629\nAnd now it sees my Time Machine disk,\nand it's gonna wait, and\n\n440\n00:20:58.629 --> 00:21:02.329\nat 10:16 AM, after one hour,\nit's gonna try and\n\n441\n00:21:02.329 --> 00:21:07.020\ndo another backup, or\nI could tell it to back up right now.\n\n442\n00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.730\nNow I've got a 500 gig disk in my laptop,\nright?\n\n443\n00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.579\nSo it's a 500 gig SSD and this drive\nI just plugged in is 1 terabyte,\n\n444\n00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:15.002\nwhich is double the size.\n\n445\n00:21:15.002 --> 00:21:18.734\nThat's pretty good, I should be able\nto hold a good amount of backups, and\n\n446\n00:21:18.734 --> 00:21:21.420\nif I choose to backup now,\nlet me go ahead and do that.\n\n447\n00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.900\nIt's now preparing the backup and\nthen it's gonna launch into the backup\n\n448\n00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.080\nprocess and\nif I open my Time Machine preferences,\n\n449\n00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.010\nwe'll actually see it\na little bit better in here.\n\n450\n00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:35.420\nThere we go, and I can see that right\nnow my Time Machine backup is encrypted,\n\n451\n00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:41.740\nand I've got 999 gigs of space,\n637 gigs of which are free.\n\n452\n00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:46.570\nOkay, so\nthat means that I'm only using, what,\n\n453\n00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.070\n350 gigs of my disk,\nI've got tons of empty space on there.\n\n454\n00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.260\nWell, how far back will I go,\n\n455\n00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.100\nit actually goes back to the last\ntime that I had to wipe that disk.\n\n456\n00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:59.390\nSo I have had to wipe my Time Machine\ndisk, cuz I've used it for other things,\n\n457\n00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.244\nbut it should go back pretty far.\n\n458\n00:22:01.244 --> 00:22:03.900\nLet's enter Time Machine and\nsee how far back we can go.\n\n459\n00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.410\nSo for example,\nlet's say here on my desktop,\n\n460\n00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:10.140\nmaybe I had a file sitting here\non my desktop and I deleted it.\n\n461\n00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.850\nAnd I say, I wanna get that file back,\nbut I deleted it months ago.\n\n462\n00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.660\nThat's a long time, it's probably\nnot in my trash anymore, right?\n\n463\n00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.300\nSo if I go on my trash,\nmaybe I find it, maybe I don't.\n\n464\n00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.210\nBut if I go into Time Machine,\n\n465\n00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:28.080\nI can browse to a folder, it's always\nbetter to browse to the folder first.\n\n466\n00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.440\nSo I'm gonna browse to the folder,\nI'm gonna browse to my desktop, and so\n\n467\n00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.110\nhere's my desktop.\n\n468\n00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.160\nAnd then, once you're looking\nat the desktop in Finder,\n\n469\n00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.930\nyou're gonna go up to that menu, and\nyou can choose to Enter Time Machine.\n\n470\n00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:40.950\nMy backup finally started.\n\n471\n00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.300\nAnd so I'll enter Time Machine.\n\n472\n00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.411\nNow, once I enter Time Machine,\nthe screen goes a little crazy.\n\n473\n00:22:46.411 --> 00:22:47.129\n&gt;&gt; It's awesome.\n\n474\n00:22:47.129 --> 00:22:48.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really cool.\n\n475\n00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:55.213\nWhat I'm seeing is the desktop folder\nkind of repeating through perpetuity.\n\n476\n00:22:55.213 --> 00:22:58.627\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I'm looking back\nthrough the corridors of time to when\n\n477\n00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:00.080\nyour backups started.\n\n478\n00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.570\n&gt;&gt; You use this little up\ndown arrow over here to pick.\n\n479\n00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.968\nThat was today now,\nhere's today at 8:53 AM, today at 2:53 AM.\n\n480\n00:23:06.968 --> 00:23:10.518\nNow, that's interesting,\nwhy did skip six hours?\n\n481\n00:23:10.518 --> 00:23:12.980\nBecause nothing changed, right?\n\n482\n00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.870\nI was asleep [LAUGH] and so\nnothing changed from 2:53 AM to 8:53 AM so\n\n483\n00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.330\nit didn't do a backup during that.\n\n484\n00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.340\nIf nothing changed, why backup, right?\n\n485\n00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.270\nBut something must have\nchanged after 1:53 AM, right?\n\n486\n00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.560\nWhich is probably some kind\nof automatic backup or\n\n487\n00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.730\nsomething like that that occurred\nthat made it do a backup there.\n\n488\n00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.499\nBut if I keep going back, it says 1:54 AM,\n\n489\n00:23:33.499 --> 00:23:37.500\n1:53, there were two backups\nwithin one minute, right?\n\n490\n00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.920\nThat's definitely a sign\nof an automatic update.\n\n491\n00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.385\nWhen an automatic update happens,\nit'll do a backup before the update and\n\n492\n00:23:43.385 --> 00:23:45.044\na backup after the update, right?\n\n493\n00:23:45.044 --> 00:23:48.264\nThe one after the update is so you've\ngot a backup that includes the update,\n\n494\n00:23:48.264 --> 00:23:50.578\nthe one before is in case\nthe update breaks something,\n\n495\n00:23:50.578 --> 00:23:51.955\nI can roll back to right before.\n\n496\n00:23:51.955 --> 00:23:54.696\nSo whenever you see two back to back,\nthat's almost always a sign.\n\n497\n00:23:54.696 --> 00:23:56.261\nThen you took automatic updates.\n\n498\n00:23:56.261 --> 00:24:01.022\nBut if I wanna go back months, right,\nover here on the right side, I've got my\n\n499\n00:24:01.022 --> 00:24:05.873\ntimeline, and the timeline is pretty cool\nalso as far as levels of coolness go.\n\n500\n00:24:05.873 --> 00:24:08.727\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you can just kind of swipe your\n\n501\n00:24:08.727 --> 00:24:13.027\nmouse across here and find all\nsorts of history back here, right?\n\n502\n00:24:13.027 --> 00:24:14.965\n&gt;&gt; Easier to kinda navigate through.\n\n503\n00:24:14.965 --> 00:24:15.850\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n504\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:16.464\nYeah, and I can go all the way back.\n\n505\n00:24:16.464 --> 00:24:20.036\nIt looks like my backup\nstopped April 28th.\n\n506\n00:24:20.036 --> 00:24:23.960\nAnd I think I'll talk about\nthis in another show.\n\n507\n00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.320\nMy laptop, I had the monitor fail.\n\n508\n00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.720\nI had to take it in and\nget it replaced and so when they fixed it,\n\n509\n00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.150\nI brought it back and I restored Time\nMachine or restored from Time Machine so\n\n510\n00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.580\nI put it back to the way it was.\n\n511\n00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.350\nBut I also erased my Time Machine\ndisk afterwards and started it over,\n\n512\n00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.050\ncuz I wanted to generate\na new encryption key.\n\n513\n00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.640\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; And so when I did that, cuz I never\n\n514\n00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:47.400\ntrust like, when I've had somebody else\nuse my laptop, I know that the odds\n\n515\n00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.140\nof them guessing an encryption key, or\nbrute forcing, or whatever, is pretty low.\n\n516\n00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.400\nBut I always prefer to change my\nkeys after somebody else has handled\n\n517\n00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.990\nthe equipment, so that's what I did.\n\n518\n00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.490\nAnd that's why mine only\ngoes back to April 28th.\n\n519\n00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:01.960\nThat also explains why I'm only using 350\ngigs of my storage and not more, right?\n\n520\n00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.461\nI should have gone further back.\n\n521\n00:25:03.461 --> 00:25:08.161\nAll right, now I can go through here and\nlook at my desktop folder way back,\n\n522\n00:25:08.161 --> 00:25:09.812\nall the way April 28th.\n\n523\n00:25:09.812 --> 00:25:11.340\nLet's see what it looked like back then.\n\n524\n00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.010\nActually I have no idea.\n\n525\n00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:16.230\nSo we can jump back there, and\nit looks pretty much the same actually.\n\n526\n00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:20.380\nI had an examples folder that was not\nthere, but I can look at the files and\n\n527\n00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.490\nthings that were on my desktop\nas they were back then.\n\n528\n00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.843\nI can choose them, and\nrestore them, and off we go, right?\n\n529\n00:25:25.843 --> 00:25:29.106\nAll right, so what we've just saw,\n\n530\n00:25:29.106 --> 00:25:34.492\nthat is an example of a Time Machine\nbackup to a disk, right?\n\n531\n00:25:34.492 --> 00:25:38.460\nBut I mentioned there were other place\nthat we could back up to a server, right?\n\n532\n00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.070\nIn a server, let me just jump over here.\n\n533\n00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.140\nThis is a machine that's\nrunning macOS Sierra and\n\n534\n00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.010\nI've installed the OS 10 server app.\n\n535\n00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.568\nThe server app is available\nright in the app store.\n\n536\n00:25:48.568 --> 00:25:51.194\nYou just go in there, you download it,\ninstall it, you got it, right?\n\n537\n00:25:51.194 --> 00:25:52.807\nIt cost $20.\n\n538\n00:25:52.807 --> 00:25:54.300\nPay $20, now you got a server.\n\n539\n00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.700\nSo, it's actually really reasonable.\n\n540\n00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.750\nIn the server app though,\nif you look down the left side,\n\n541\n00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.110\nyou'll find where there is\na Time Machine service.\n\n542\n00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.500\nAnd if you choose that\nTime Machine service,\n\n543\n00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.230\nthere's not a whole lot of\noptions you've got to specify.\n\n544\n00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.740\nFirst off, you need to add a backup disk.\n\n545\n00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.090\nSo if you've got a storage area network,\nor multiple disks, or whatever,\n\n546\n00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:13.760\nyou'll add them in.\n\n547\n00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.970\nSo I've added in a backup disk right\nhere as one of my backup destinations.\n\n548\n00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:23.010\nAnd once you've done that,\nyou then hit this big On button, up here.\n\n549\n00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:23.740\nAnd it's done.\n\n550\n00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.010\nYou just set up a Time Machine server.\n\n551\n00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.678\nIt's that easy.\n\n552\n00:26:25.678 --> 00:26:28.981\nYou might wanna tweak who's allowed\nto connect to it, and so on.\n\n553\n00:26:28.981 --> 00:26:32.730\nBut otherwise, this is a Time Machine\nserver now that is up and running.\n\n554\n00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.710\nAnd if I take a look at the backups tab,\n\n555\n00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.640\nI can look at all the backups\nthat have been deposited here.\n\n556\n00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.910\nWell, nobody's backed up to it yet,\nso I don't see anything.\n\n557\n00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.250\nIf I wanna get somebody set up for that,\nI just need to go into their Time Machine\n\n558\n00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:46.320\noptions and instead of choosing a disk,\nI need to choose this server.\n\n559\n00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.220\nAnd the same thing would be true for\n\n560\n00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:53.060\nthe time capsule devices,\nif we wanna back up to one of those.\n\n561\n00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.656\nSo we go through and get them set up,\n\n562\n00:26:54.656 --> 00:26:57.332\nwe'll jump in and\nwe'll see this server as a destination.\n\n563\n00:26:57.332 --> 00:27:00.663\nYou'll see your local disks,\nyou'll see the time capsule option,\n\n564\n00:27:00.663 --> 00:27:04.180\nand you'll see this server showing up\nin the list and we can back up to it.\n\n565\n00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.979\nNow Daniel, I've got a handful of other\nthings that I wanna talk about here.\n\n566\n00:27:06.979 --> 00:27:12.038\nI wanna show connecting a client to\nthis server, I wanna show the local\n\n567\n00:27:12.038 --> 00:27:16.520\ncached Time Machine,\nI haven't even talked about that yet.\n\n568\n00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.503\nBut my client is stuck encrypting\nthat disk right now, or\n\n569\n00:27:19.503 --> 00:27:23.730\nactually I guess it finally got past\nthat encryption, but he's got 31 minutes\n\n570\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:28.163\nremaining on its backup, and I'm not a\ngiant patient man, or something like this.\n\n571\n00:27:28.163 --> 00:27:28.872\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n572\n00:27:28.872 --> 00:27:31.027\nwhy don't we do this,\nwhy don't we break off in to a part 2.\n\n573\n00:27:31.027 --> 00:27:32.615\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that way I can wait for\n\n574\n00:27:32.615 --> 00:27:36.222\nthis backup to finish, and in part 2,\nwe'll take this client and instead of\n\n575\n00:27:36.222 --> 00:27:40.217\nbacking him up to the disk, we'll get them\nto back up against the network server, and\n\n576\n00:27:40.217 --> 00:27:42.970\nthat will be a lot more of\nan enterprise type solution.\n\n577\n00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.667\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\nAnd that's actual and\n\n578\n00:27:44.667 --> 00:27:48.129\nnatural stopping spot,\ngreat segue into going from home,\n\n579\n00:27:48.129 --> 00:27:51.300\npersonal use into more\nenterprise type of solution.\n\n580\n00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.780\nSo definitely do that.\n\n581\n00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.200\nWe did thank you go getting us this far to\nfigure out how we can use Time Machine.\n\n582\n00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.370\nAs you've seen super easy,\ngreat product, works really,\n\n583\n00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.560\nreally well, not too difficult.\n\n584\n00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.890\nSo, definitely, check out the next episode\nwe're about to do about doing that\n\n585\n00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.310\nenterprise side solution.\n\n586\n00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.853\nThat being said, as Don said,\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n587\n00:28:08.853 --> 00:28:10.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n588\n00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.470\ncall it a day.\n\n589\n00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:13.850\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n590\n00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:15.279\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n591\n00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:22.360\n[MUSIC]\n\n592\n00:28:22.360 -->

00:00:08.214\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:10.560\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.370\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.690\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode well,\n\n8\n00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.330\nwe're back with more of the ACSP series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.895\nAnd, of course, joining us back yet\nagain, continuing our Time Machine backup\n\n10\n00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:29.520\nplus series here is our good friend,\nMr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.336\nDon, you're back in time [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:32.110\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n13\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.930\nWe are back and basically just waited for\nthat initial backup to complete so\n\n14\n00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.380\nthat we could jump in and\nsee how it works.\n\n15\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.240\nNow that the backup is done,\n\n16\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.640\nwe need to look at how it\nstored the files on the disk.\n\n17\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.540\nHow that worked, and\nwe've kind of already seen recoverings,\n\n18\n00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.350\nwe don't need to tackle that.\n\n19\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.420\nBut I wanted to show you guys\nhow that folder structure works,\n\n20\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.570\ncuz it's kind of important.\n\n21\n00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.890\nI wanna show you connecting\nthis client to a server,\n\n22\n00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.650\ninstead of just backing up to a disk.\n\n23\n00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.353\nAnd show you a couple other little tweaks\nthat we have inside of Time Machine.\n\n24\n00:00:57.353 --> 00:01:00.345\nAnd so that's what we've got\nbefore us right here in part two.\n\n25\n00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:03.055\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, well,\nlet's pick up where we left off and\n\n26\n00:01:03.055 --> 00:01:04.085\ncontinue down the road.\n\n27\n00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:07.265\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we did a backup and\nthe backup has completed.\n\n28\n00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:09.745\nI know it's completed\ncuz if I look up here I\n\n29\n00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:13.135\ncan click on that Time Machine menu\nitem we added in the last episode.\n\n30\n00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:16.195\nAnd I can see the last backup\nwas today at 10:55 AM.\n\n31\n00:01:16.195 --> 00:01:17.245\nRight now it's 11:07,\n\n32\n00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:21.660\nso about 12 minutes ago it finished\nthe backup and now we're ready to rock.\n\n33\n00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.820\n&gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing.\n\n34\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.852\n&gt;&gt; And now that doesn't tell\nme how many backups I had.\n\n35\n00:01:24.852 --> 00:01:28.120\nI could've had 50 backups, 100 backups,\nor I could just have one backup, but\n\n36\n00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.390\nit just shows me the latest one.\n\n37\n00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.150\nI know that it's done as opposed to\nseeing that it's backing up right now.\n\n38\n00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.520\nI would be waiting, and\nthere would be a little progress bar.\n\n39\n00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.580\nAll right, so it backed up.\n\n40\n00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.690\nWhat does a backup look like?\n\n41\n00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.710\nWell, if I go to my Time Machine disk,\nand I open it up,\n\n42\n00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.970\nwhat you'll see is a folder\ncalled Backups.backupdb.\n\n43\n00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.770\nBackupdb is backup database, it's not\nreally a database, it's just a folder.\n\n44\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.890\nAnd if you browse into the folder, what\nyou're going to see is a computer name.\n\n45\n00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.310\nNow, why a computer name?\n\n46\n00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.360\nBecause I might be using a backup\ndisk on more than one computer.\n\n47\n00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.470\nI might have a Time Machine disk and\nDaniel and I share it.\n\n48\n00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.320\nI give him the disk and\nhe backs up his laptop.\n\n49\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.040\nThen I come over here and I backup mine.\n\n50\n00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.090\nSo we would have separate folders for\neach computer.\n\n51\n00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.860\nNow on removable storage like this\nthat doesn't normally happen.\n\n52\n00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.410\nBut on a server, it does.\n\n53\n00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.700\nIf we're backing up to a server,\n\n54\n00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.390\nyou can have hundreds of clients all\nbacking themselves up to one server.\n\n55\n00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.360\nSo it's gotta maintain\nseparate folders for\n\n56\n00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.020\neach one based on the name of that client.\n\n57\n00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.380\nAnd remember,\nif you don't know the name of your client,\n\n58\n00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.990\nit's usually something silly\nlike Don's Mac Book Pro.\n\n59\n00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.050\nBut if you go into your\nsystem preferences and\n\n60\n00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.900\ngo into sharing,\nthat's where the name comes from.\n\n61\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.635\nSo if I go into system preferences and\nsharing, whatever's up here,\n\n62\n00:02:40.635 --> 00:02:42.892\nthat's the name of your client.\n\n63\n00:02:42.892 --> 00:02:45.705\nAnd so on the time machine server\nthat's where that name of the folder\n\n64\n00:02:45.705 --> 00:02:46.440\nwould come from.\n\n65\n00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.610\nAll right, now if I go inside of that\nfolder, here's where the backup is.\n\n66\n00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.020\nAnd I can see that I actually\nhave two backups, not one.\n\n67\n00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.160\nI don't know why I have two but\n\n68\n00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.650\nI do, so if you wait long\nenough you'll have plenty more.\n\n69\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.180\nIn fact if we go and\ntake a look at my laptop here, right, and\n\n70\n00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.370\nI'll take a look at my actual laptop.\n\n71\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.443\nAnd remember on my actual laptop you\ncan see my folder is Don's MacBook Pro,\n\n72\n00:03:08.443 --> 00:03:09.533\nsomething simple.\n\n73\n00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:15.080\nAnd if I go in there, I've got tons of\nbackups all the way back up to April 28th.\n\n74\n00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.820\nAnd what you're seeing is one folder for\neach backup.\n\n75\n00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.420\nNow, the original backup,\n\n76\n00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.920\nthe very first one that's taken is a full\nbackup of my entire laptop, all the data.\n\n77\n00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.180\nAnd then every other backup that's\nmade is just what's changed.\n\n78\n00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.304\nSo if I look at this one,\nthis 4-28, that's the full backup.\n\n79\n00:03:34.304 --> 00:03:40.470\nAnd then 4-29, 4-30, each of these\nare just what changed since then.\n\n80\n00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.690\nOkay, but if my disk gets full its gotta\ndelete the old and make room for the new.\n\n81\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.950\nSo what happens when it deletes 4-28?\n\n82\n00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.720\nDoesn't that delete my full backup?\n\n83\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.780\nWell it actually doesn't.\n\n84\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.460\nWhen you look in these folders,\nyou're not actually seeing real files.\n\n85\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.990\nWhat you're seeing are a ton of aliases.\n\n86\n00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.930\nSo when I browse into this folder for\nexample, I can see Macintosh HD and\n\n87\n00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.540\nthen I see Applications,\nLibrary, opt, System, Users.\n\n88\n00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.740\nI'm seeing a full back up.\n\n89\n00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.810\nAnd I can see user accounts\nthat I've got on my system.\n\n90\n00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.710\nI can browse into my user account.\n\n91\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.830\nAnd I can browse into desktop and\nI'm seeing everything.\n\n92\n00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.460\nEverything that would be in here.\n\n93\n00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.680\nOkay, well if I go back and\nI pick another folder.\n\n94\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.030\nLet me pick one from like May 17th,\na lot of backups on May 17th.\n\n95\n00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.623\nSo if I go into May 17th,\nI browse into Macintosh HD.\n\n96\n00:04:31.623 --> 00:04:35.497\nI see all the folders I can come in and\nI see dpezet.\n\n97\n00:04:35.497 --> 00:04:38.868\nAnd I come in here and I can see my\ndesktop, and I browse in here and\n\n98\n00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:40.160\nI see my desktop.\n\n99\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.500\nNow notice I've got these\npodcast files sitting here.\n\n100\n00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.450\nThose podcast files are sitting\nin the other backup also.\n\n101\n00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.080\nAre they stored twice?\n\n102\n00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.960\nWell if they didn't change,\nno, they're only stored once.\n\n103\n00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.282\nThere's an alias in every\none of these backups.\n\n104\n00:04:56.282 --> 00:04:59.470\n&gt;&gt; So it's just kinda like showing you\na representation of the actual file?\n\n105\n00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's what makes it so\nnice and easy.\n\n106\n00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.890\nIs that if I wanna go and restore\nthings how they looked on April 28th,\n\n107\n00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.460\nI don't have to go to just one folder.\n\n108\n00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.891\nWell, I guess April 28th's a bad example.\n\n109\n00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:13.755\nIf I wanna restore from May 17th,\nI don't have to access May 17th and\n\n110\n00:05:13.755 --> 00:05:17.080\nevery folder before it to get everything.\n\n111\n00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.180\nAnd that's how the old style\nincremental backups would work.\n\n112\n00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.490\nBecause you would restore your full\nbackup and then every incremental,\n\n113\n00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.420\nall the way up until the point\nwhere you were current.\n\n114\n00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.280\nWe don't have to do that.\n\n115\n00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.500\nThanks to the aliases\nthat are put in place.\n\n116\n00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.760\nAnd the only time a real file\nis in there is if it changed.\n\n117\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.330\nIf it changed, the real files there and\nit's not an alias, but\n\n118\n00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.630\nthen every backup afterwards would\nhave an alias to points that change.\n\n119\n00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.300\nSo that keeps the size really\noptimized and nice and small.\n\n120\n00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.620\nWhen you browse into a folder,\nit looks like a full set of your data.\n\n121\n00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.851\nBut it's using the macOS extended general\nfile systems alias functions to be able to\n\n122\n00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:51.165\nshrink all that down.\n\n123\n00:05:51.165 --> 00:05:53.480\nSo it's kind of neat to see\nhow that's stored in there and\n\n124\n00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.459\nreally design which is convenient and\neasy work with.\n\n125\n00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.370\nNow this is not the only place\nthat my backups are being stored.\n\n126\n00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.530\nIf I've got my removable media plugged in\nor I'm connected to my network server and\n\n127\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.030\nI'm backing up to it,\nthese backups are gonna get located here.\n\n128\n00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.950\nBut what about times when I'm not\nconnected to my removable media?\n\n129\n00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.390\nSo maybe I'm traveling,\nI'm at a hotel somewhere.\n\n130\n00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.550\nI leave my Time Machine\ndrive back at the office.\n\n131\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.640\nWell, the time machine backup happen, they\njust don't backup to the external disk,\n\n132\n00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.300\nbecause the external disk isn't there.\n\n133\n00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.620\nInstead they backup to a local cache.\n\n134\n00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.380\nSo there's another place I wanna\nshow you here on the disk.\n\n135\n00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.930\nI'm gonna fire up a terminal.\n\n136\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.940\nActually, let me use my\nvirtual machine for this.\n\n137\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:39.600\nSo I'm gonna fire up a terminal and\non the disk,\n\n138\n00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.190\nif I browse to the volumes folder,\nso I'm gonna go to /volumes.\n\n139\n00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.770\nAnd we take a look in there, what you'll\nsee are a couple of different folders.\n\n140\n00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.780\nI can see a link Macintosh HD,\ncuz that's a mounted disk that I've got.\n\n141\n00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.840\nAnd I can see a link to Time Machine.\n\n142\n00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.260\nAnd the Time Machine,\nthat's my USB drive that's attached.\n\n143\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.560\nNow if I unplug that Time Machine disk,\nI can't back up to it anymore.\n\n144\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.500\nAnd so Time Machine can't work.\n\n145\n00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.290\nWell, what it'll do is it'll\ncreate another folder, and\n\n146\n00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.720\nthat folder will be called Mobile Backups.\n\n147\n00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.220\nAnd the Mobile Backups,\n\n148\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.410\nbasically a Time Machine backup location\nthat's stored right here on the same disk.\n\n149\n00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.470\nNow if my disk fails I lose that backup,\nso it doesn't save me from disk failure.\n\n150\n00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.420\nBut if I accidentally delete something,\nwhen I enter Time Machine it's gonna look\n\n151\n00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.230\nnot only at my Time Machine\ndisk if I've got it.\n\n152\n00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.770\nBut it'll also look at the mobile backup.\n\n153\n00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.020\nNow this machine,\nsince I turned Time Machine on,\n\n154\n00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.440\nhas never had a moment when it didn't\nhave the Time Machine disk available.\n\n155\n00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.680\nBut my laptop definitely has.\n\n156\n00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.830\nAnd so on my laptop if I browse\ninto /Volumes I can take a look.\n\n157\n00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.330\nAnd there it is,\nthat mobile backups folder, right there.\n\n158\n00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.426\nI didn't create that, right.\n\n159\n00:07:52.426 --> 00:07:57.031\nI can see it was created May 18th,\nor sorry, it was modified May 18th,\n\n160\n00:07:57.031 --> 00:07:58.653\nwhich is actually today.\n\n161\n00:07:58.653 --> 00:08:00.812\nSo it's being worked with and being used.\n\n162\n00:08:00.812 --> 00:08:06.790\nAnytime a backup occurs when I\ndon't have my USB drive attached.\n\n163\n00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.140\n&gt;&gt; So it just runs a standard\nincremental backup for the data or\n\n164\n00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.965\nwhatever scheduled and\nthen puts into that mobile backups folder.\n\n165\n00:08:13.965 --> 00:08:14.637\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n166\n00:08:14.637 --> 00:08:19.015\n&gt;&gt; So you don't need that full back up\nto kind of have those alias pointers?\n\n167\n00:08:19.015 --> 00:08:23.245\n&gt;&gt; This one is just getting the changes\nand that's all that it's got, right.\n\n168\n00:08:23.245 --> 00:08:26.765\nSo basically, if I change a file it's\npreserving the old form of the file.\n\n169\n00:08:26.765 --> 00:08:29.825\nThe new form of the file is written to\nthis already, and then it all gets backed\n\n170\n00:08:29.825 --> 00:08:31.875\nup to your Time Machine disk\nwhen it becomes available again.\n\n171\n00:08:31.875 --> 00:08:33.875\nThis is designed to be temporary, but\n\n172\n00:08:33.875 --> 00:08:37.230\nif you browse into that folder you'll see\nwhere there's a backup stop backup DB.\n\n173\n00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.220\nAnd if I want to browse through that,\nthrough the GUI, right, so if I go here to\n\n174\n00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.660\nmy Finder, I can't even get to /volumes,\ncan I, right?\n\n175\n00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:52.090\nBut if I use the Go menu up here,\nI'll choose Go to Location, Go to Folder.\n\n176\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:57.170\nAnd I'm gonna browse to\n/volumes/mobilebackups, now, I can browse\n\n177\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:02.510\nto it and there's backup DB, Dawn's\nMacbook Pro, and then I see backups.\n\n178\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.933\nAnd while that folder showed is being\ncreated or modified on May 18th,\n\n179\n00:09:05.933 --> 00:09:08.134\nI can see I've got\nbackups back to May 12th.\n\n180\n00:09:08.134 --> 00:09:10.410\n&gt;&gt; So it does continue to keep\nthose backups even though,\n\n181\n00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.471\nyou've reconnected to your Time Machine.\n\n182\n00:09:12.471 --> 00:09:14.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nCuz I've been connected to my Time Machine\n\n183\n00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.230\ndrive all morning.\n\n184\n00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.462\nIt will keep the nails like a cash, right,\nand while that sounds like a good thing,\n\n185\n00:09:18.462 --> 00:09:20.724\nhey, it's available even if\nI'm in my tarnishing disk,\n\n186\n00:09:20.724 --> 00:09:22.961\nI'll actually be able to\ncover cover back to May 12th.\n\n187\n00:09:22.961 --> 00:09:26.071\nIf I delete some and I go back to\nthe list a handfull of days, right,\n\n188\n00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:29.630\nit's about weeks worth of back\nup being installed right here.\n\n189\n00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:36.020\nBut, what if I got Macbook Air and\nI've only got a 128 gig SSD, right?\n\n190\n00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.253\nThat's a pretty common model because\nthey're inexpensive, right, so\n\n191\n00:09:38.253 --> 00:09:39.798\na lot of people have those.\n\n192\n00:09:39.798 --> 00:09:44.605\nI don't wanna waste disk space for this\nlocal cache, and if you reliably plugged\n\n193\n00:09:44.605 --> 00:09:47.340\ninto your Time Machine disk,\nyou might not want to keep this cache.\n\n194\n00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.370\nYou actually can turn it off\nif you don't want to use it.\n\n195\n00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.515\nSo for example, here on my laptop, let me\njust back out of this folder a little bit.\n\n196\n00:09:54.515 --> 00:09:57.446\n&gt;&gt; I could imagine this\ngetting really bad if you\n\n197\n00:09:57.446 --> 00:10:00.696\nwere working with large files a lot and\ndeleting.\n\n198\n00:10:00.696 --> 00:10:04.450\nIt's making copies of those large files.\n\n199\n00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and it would continue to grow.\n\n200\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.698\nNow, it does have a limit,\nI don't actually recall it.\n\n201\n00:10:08.698 --> 00:10:11.798\nIt's like 15% of the total disk storage or\nsomething like that, but\n\n202\n00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:14.755\nif you've got 128 gig disk,\neven that 15% is very valuable.\n\n203\n00:10:14.755 --> 00:10:16.300\n&gt;&gt; You feel that, yeah.\n\n204\n00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.750\n&gt;&gt; So you can turn it off, I've got\nit pulled up here in the Finder, so\n\n205\n00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.490\nI see Macintosh.hd,\nMobileBackups in Time Machine.\n\n206\n00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.120\nSo there's that MobileBackups folder,\nI'm in the /volumes folder.\n\n207\n00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.210\nBack in my terminal,\nI'm gonna turn it off.\n\n208\n00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.700\nAnd the way you turn it off is, there's\na command line utility which is tmutil.\n\n209\n00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.650\nRight, now, you do need to be\nan administrator to use tmutil, whoops.\n\n210\n00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.270\nSo I'm going to sudo this command.\n\n211\n00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:43.870\nAnd if you just do a sudo tmutil and\nrun it, it'll sit there for\n\n212\n00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.000\na second, well, prompt for a password,\nI guess we gotta get past that.\n\n213\n00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.477\nAnd then it'll show me the syntax for\nthe command.\n\n214\n00:10:48.477 --> 00:10:50.860\nAnd you'll see where you\ncan do a lot of stuff.\n\n215\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.110\nYou can initiate a Time Machine\nbackup right from the command line,\n\n216\n00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.200\nyou can restore files from\nthe Time Machine backup,\n\n217\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.070\nright from command line\nlike tmutil does all that.\n\n218\n00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:03.440\nWell, tmutil has two little modifiers\nthat we can make use of that\n\n219\n00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.950\nthat are pretty handy for this.\n\n220\n00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:12.860\nIt's tmutil disablelocal or\ntmutil enable local.\n\n221\n00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:18.710\nThis is enable to turn on the mobile\nbackups cache or disable to turn it off.\n\n222\n00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.490\nSo if I wanna reclaim that disk space and\n\n223\n00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:25.350\njust use my external storage,\nI can say tmutil disablelocal and\n\n224\n00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.560\nwhen I issue that, that's gonna\nkill off the mobile backups, right?\n\n225\n00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.230\nNow, if I look back in my Finder,\nI can still see mobile backups.\n\n226\n00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:38.520\nIt's still there and see how mobile\nbackups, it shows as being 500 gigs?\n\n227\n00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.762\nThat's because I have 500 gig hard\ndrive and it's using aliases and\n\n228\n00:11:40.762 --> 00:11:41.927\nthings to create this environment.\n\n229\n00:11:41.927 --> 00:11:47.506\nSo it looks like it's 500 gig, But\nif I go into it I still see data there,\n\n230\n00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:51.240\nbut the next Time Machine\nruns in a purge all this.\n\n231\n00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.780\nAnd so in a moment we'll see\nall these kind of disappear.\n\n232\n00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.980\nThe finder always takes a little while\nto reflect in the GUI what's going on in\n\n233\n00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.250\nthe file system behind it.\n\n234\n00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.290\nBut it'll purge all this the next\ntime the Time Machine runs.\n\n235\n00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.323\nIf I wanna turn it back on, I can just run\nthe same command acceptance instead of\n\n236\n00:12:06.323 --> 00:12:09.607\ndisable local, I can say enable local and\nit'll turn it back on.\n\n237\n00:12:09.607 --> 00:12:13.011\nAnd now, the next time time machine runs,\nIt will recreate the mobile\n\n238\n00:12:13.011 --> 00:12:16.740\nbackup's folder, and starts to put\nthat data back in there, right?\n\n239\n00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.530\nIf you're in hurry, you can always\njust disable it and then go and\n\n240\n00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.800\ndelete the mobile back up folder.\n\n241\n00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.357\nYou can just delete it and\nempty your trash and it's gone and\n\n242\n00:12:23.357 --> 00:12:24.740\nwill get created again.\n\n243\n00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.850\nSo if you wanna reclaim that cache base,\nyou can't,\n\n244\n00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.890\nit's pretty straight forward right but\nin my case, I actually kind of like it\n\n245\n00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.948\nbecause sometimes I make it\nchange while I'm travelling.\n\n246\n00:12:33.948 --> 00:12:36.180\nAnd I wanna recover back to one hour,\nor two hours, and\n\n247\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.060\nI don't carry my disk with me,\nmy Time Machine backup.\n\n248\n00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.930\nAnd I don't carry it with me on purpose.\n\n249\n00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.020\nRight, because if somebody\nsteals my laptop bag,\n\n250\n00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.678\nthey'd be stealing my laptop and\nmy Time Machine backup.\n\n251\n00:12:45.678 --> 00:12:48.070\nSo I wanna leave my\nTime Machine disk behind, but\n\n252\n00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.550\nI still want to benefit\nfrom Time Machine itself.\n\n253\n00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.830\nSo that's kind of what it does.\n\n254\n00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.790\n&gt;&gt; Now, one of my favorite things about\nTime Machine, Don, is the fact that\n\n255\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:00.570\nif I needed to, I could actually\nrestore my entire system, right.\n\n256\n00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:04.370\nNot just individual files, but\nI can make that system come back\n\n257\n00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.180\nto a state in time in which it had\na Time Machine backup, correct?\n\n258\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.170\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah, when you get\na brand new Mac and you power it on, and\n\n259\n00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.970\nyou start that installation wizard,\none of the questions it asks you is,\n\n260\n00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.200\ndo you want to restore your data?\n\n261\n00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.520\nAnd if you choose yes,\nit will ask where from, and\n\n262\n00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.000\nit'll say, a Windows machine,\nanother Mac, or a Time Machine backup?\n\n263\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.260\nAnd you can point it to\na Time Machine backup and\n\n264\n00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.530\nit'll restore your system all\nback from that backup, right.\n\n265\n00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:31.710\nBut you don't even have to have a new Mac\non an old Mac, you could boot to recovery.\n\n266\n00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.650\nAnd when you boot to recovery,\nit has the option right there,\n\n267\n00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.130\nrestore from Time Machine,\nright in recovery.\n\n268\n00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.540\nSo you can restore right back.\n\n269\n00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.580\nWell, what if, I have a hard drive die in\nmy Mac and I replace the hard drive so\n\n270\n00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.728\nit's completely blank,\nI can't boot to recovery, right?\n\n271\n00:13:46.728 --> 00:13:48.840\nIt's not gonna launch\nan installation wizard, well,\n\n272\n00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.120\non the newest match you can do internet\nrecovery where it'll download the recovery\n\n273\n00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.020\npartition from the internet, but\non an older Mac you can't do that and\n\n274\n00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.100\nmaybe you don't have internet access,\nright?\n\n275\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.100\nWell, if you have a Time Machine Backup,\n\n276\n00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.930\nthere's actually a little secret\nabout Time Machine Backups.\n\n277\n00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.690\nThey have a recovery\npartition on the disk.\n\n278\n00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.570\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n279\n00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.750\nIf I go in the Disk utility,\nif I can type Disk utility.\n\n280\n00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.130\nThat will be my challenge of the day,\nhere's my Time Machine backup.\n\n281\n00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.210\nIt's a Western Digital Elements disk,\nright?\n\n282\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.210\nIt's one terabyte in size, and\nit's got one partition on it,\n\n283\n00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.740\nmy Time Machine backup.\n\n284\n00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.660\nWell, it's lying to me.\n\n285\n00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.240\nThere's actually another partition\non here, there's actually two more.\n\n286\n00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.570\nThere's an EFI boot partition, so\n\n287\n00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.980\nwe don't see that, and then there's\na recovery partition that's hidden on it.\n\n288\n00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.330\nI could actually boot from\nmy Time Machine disk.\n\n289\n00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:39.690\nSo I could go to a Mac with\na completely blank hard drive,\n\n290\n00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.610\npower it on holding the Alt key,\nand I would see my boot menu.\n\n291\n00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.730\nThe internal drive won't show up because\nit's blank, can't boot from it, but\n\n292\n00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.320\nmy Time Machine disk would.\n\n293\n00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.080\nAnd I could pick the Time Machine disk,\nand\n\n294\n00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.440\nit would boot Recovery from\nthe Time Machine disk.\n\n295\n00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.830\nAnd then I could choose Restore from\nTime Machine and it would restore the Mac\n\n296\n00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.680\nback from a complete blank hard drive\nright back to the way that it was.\n\n297\n00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.550\nNow I don't see the GUI, but\nI can see it in the command line.\n\n298\n00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:07.770\nIn the command line,\nif you run, let's see,\n\n299\n00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:12.960\nit is sudo diskutil list, right?\n\n300\n00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.310\nThis is the command line\nversion of the disk utility,\n\n301\n00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.070\nthe disk utility that I was just in,\nright?\n\n302\n00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.200\nAnd so if I run list, I'm saying list\nall the disks that are available.\n\n303\n00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.585\nAnd so it's gonna show me all of my\ndisks and the first one that I see here,\n\n304\n00:15:26.585 --> 00:15:31.641\nif I kind of look is my disk 0 which\nis labeled Macintosh HD, right?\n\n305\n00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:37.081\nAnd my Macintosh hard drive has a Recovery\nattached to it and there it is, right?\n\n306\n00:15:37.081 --> 00:15:40.250\nIt's 500 GB and that's it.\n\n307\n00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:47.500\nWell, right afterwards, I see disk1, which\nis a virtual disk, that's Macintosh HD.\n\n308\n00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.740\nWhy do I see that?\n\n309\n00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.354\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit's because my disk in encrypted.\n\n310\n00:15:50.354 --> 00:15:53.526\nI've got File Vault turned on,\nand so a File Vault,\n\n311\n00:15:53.526 --> 00:15:58.281\nyou have your real disk that's encrypted,\nand then you have your virtual disk\n\n312\n00:15:58.281 --> 00:16:01.620\nthat is- Unlocked Encrypted,\nso that you can see it.\n\n313\n00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.552\nSo that's all my internal drive,\nbut right after it, I see disk2.\n\n314\n00:16:05.552 --> 00:16:11.195\nAnd disk2 is external, physical, that's\nmy USB disk sitting beside me, right?\n\n315\n00:16:11.195 --> 00:16:16.100\nAnd I can see right here that's my time\nmachine disk, it's 1 terabyte in size.\n\n316\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.155\nBut in addition to that, it's got an EFI\nboot partition, so it's bootable.\n\n317\n00:16:20.155 --> 00:16:27.440\nAnd Boot OS X, that's the recovery\npartition that's on the disk.\n\n318\n00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.390\nSo I can actually boot right from\nmy time machine disk to recovery.\n\n319\n00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:36.143\nAnd I didn't have to turn it on,\nif you go back the watch the last episode,\n\n320\n00:16:36.143 --> 00:16:39.456\nI erased the disk and\njust added it to time machine.\n\n321\n00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:42.737\nAnd when you do that,\nit creates this partition for you.\n\n322\n00:16:42.737 --> 00:16:45.870\nPuts it in place and now it's ready to go.\n\n323\n00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.270\nSo kind of a neat little secret there,\nApple doesn't promote that a lot,\n\n324\n00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:48.900\nI don't know why.\n\n325\n00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:53.520\nBut it does embed a recovery partition\nright there on your time machine\n\n326\n00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.467\ndisk, okay?\n\n327\n00:16:54.467 --> 00:16:56.276\nAnother reason why you want\nto keep that disk separate.\n\n328\n00:16:56.276 --> 00:16:59.706\nAnd now if you ever lose your system,\nthings break down, you gotta replace\n\n329\n00:16:59.706 --> 00:17:02.981\na hard drive whatever, you know you'll\nbe able to recover off of that.\n\n330\n00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:06.020\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff,\nwell there you go ladies and gentlemen.\n\n331\n00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.658\nTime Machine has a lot of\ninteresting features built into it.\n\n332\n00:17:08.658 --> 00:17:11.147\nYou definitely wanna be doing it, right?\n\n333\n00:17:11.147 --> 00:17:14.191\nBackups are very important, cuz we always\nlike to say, if you have a failure,\n\n334\n00:17:14.191 --> 00:17:15.402\nit's when you have a failure.\n\n335\n00:17:15.402 --> 00:17:18.938\nAnd BMOD is something as\neasy as time machine,\n\n336\n00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:22.390\nwhere it gives you no\nreason not to do that.\n\n337\n00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.286\nDon, any parting words of wisdom or\nold save sayings.\n\n338\n00:17:25.286 --> 00:17:29.071\n&gt;&gt; Actually Daniel, I forgot something\nthat we need to come back and do it.\n\n339\n00:17:29.071 --> 00:17:30.117\nAt the end of the last episode,\n\n340\n00:17:30.117 --> 00:17:32.507\nI showed you guys how to set up a time\nmachine server and how easy it was.\n\n341\n00:17:32.507 --> 00:17:35.686\nAnd I said I wouldn't connect\nthe client to it, but I I didn't.\n\n342\n00:17:35.686 --> 00:17:38.874\nCUz we were waiting on the back up to\nfinish, so I don't need a do it back.\n\n343\n00:17:38.874 --> 00:17:40.168\nI need to go back in time.\n\n344\n00:17:40.168 --> 00:17:41.240\n[LAUGH].\n\n345\n00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.471\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'll see what you did there.\n\n346\n00:17:42.471 --> 00:17:44.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is a fun that never gets too old.\n\n347\n00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.397\nSo as we jump back and take a look at\nhow to get a client backing up to a time\n\n348\n00:17:47.397 --> 00:17:51.160\nmachine server instead of a local\ndisk is really not that hard.\n\n349\n00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.191\nSo to recap,\nthe Time Machine server itself, right?\n\n350\n00:17:54.191 --> 00:17:56.381\nHere, I've got a Mac OS box,\nit's up and running.\n\n351\n00:17:56.381 --> 00:17:59.698\nIt's got the OS X server app installed,\n$20 out of the App Store.\n\n352\n00:17:59.698 --> 00:18:04.409\nAll we had to do is go into Time Machine,\nadd the desired storage, and\n\n353\n00:18:04.409 --> 00:18:06.449\nflip the on switch, rightt?\n\n354\n00:18:06.449 --> 00:18:07.853\nAnd that's it, now it's up and running.\n\n355\n00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:10.920\nI've got this Time Machine server set up.\n\n356\n00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.283\nAnd if you wanna connect a client to it,\nall you got to do is jump over and\n\n357\n00:18:14.283 --> 00:18:14.967\nget it set up.\n\n358\n00:18:14.967 --> 00:18:16.328\nNow when I get it connected,\n\n359\n00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:19.640\nthis machine is already set to backup\nto a Time Machine disk, right?\n\n360\n00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.450\nThis is where we've been\nbacking up this whole time.\n\n361\n00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.541\nWell I'm gonna have a choice,\nI can back up to both, if I want.\n\n362\n00:18:25.541 --> 00:18:30.057\nI can backup to Time Machine on my disk\nand Time Machine on the server, or\n\n363\n00:18:30.057 --> 00:18:32.170\nI can just choose one.\n\n364\n00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.045\nAnd I usually recommend choosing one,\nbecause it gets confusing.\n\n365\n00:18:34.045 --> 00:18:37.731\nWhat's gonna happen is if you choose both,\nit's going to rotate back and\n\n366\n00:18:37.731 --> 00:18:39.104\nforth between backing up.\n\n367\n00:18:39.104 --> 00:18:41.772\nAnd it actually has a preference order,\nit tries to back up to the first one\n\n368\n00:18:41.772 --> 00:18:43.893\nin the list and if that fails\nthen it goes to the second one.\n\n369\n00:18:43.893 --> 00:18:46.639\nAnd it creates a bit of confusion, cuz\nyou don't know where backups are going.\n\n370\n00:18:46.639 --> 00:18:49.357\nAnd when you enter Time Machine and\nyou go to do a restore.\n\n371\n00:18:49.357 --> 00:18:54.032\nWell if both disks are available, it can\nread from both and you'll see them all.\n\n372\n00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:55.227\nAnd that's great, but\n\n373\n00:18:55.227 --> 00:18:59.438\nif one is missing it's kinda difficult to\nkeep track of where your backup resides.\n\n374\n00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:02.029\nSo I usually recommends just picking\none destination, but you can do more.\n\n375\n00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:06.107\nAnd so if I go into system preferences and\ngo into time machine.\n\n376\n00:19:06.107 --> 00:19:08.816\nI'll see right now where\nI'm set to back up that\n\n377\n00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:12.480\n1 terabyte hard drive this\nright here on my own system.\n\n378\n00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.400\nAnd if I choose Select Disk,\nI'll see my local disk on backing up too,\n\n379\n00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.920\nand I'll see some other\nentries in the list, right?\n\n380\n00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.820\nNow I see my local disk twice, and\nthe reason I see it twice is at the end of\n\n381\n00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.406\nthe last show, I turned off\nencryption to make it backup faster.\n\n382\n00:19:28.406 --> 00:19:32.283\nAnd so this is an unencrypted backup,\nif I choose the disk again,\n\n383\n00:19:32.283 --> 00:19:36.080\nit gives me the option to do\nan encrypted backup, right?\n\n384\n00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.296\nIf I do that, it's gonna erase the disk,\nI'm a lose my previous backups.\n\n385\n00:19:39.296 --> 00:19:42.580\nBut everything from now on it will\nbe encrypted and that's good.\n\n386\n00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.520\nBut that's why it shows up the second\ntime, that's how you switch to encrypt it.\n\n387\n00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.384\nAt the bottom, I'll see the Time Capsule\noption which we talked about earlier.\n\n388\n00:19:49.384 --> 00:19:52.569\nBut in between,\nI see my lab server, all ight?\n\n389\n00:19:52.569 --> 00:19:55.664\nNow I'm gonna have a bit\nof a challenge on this one.\n\n390\n00:19:55.664 --> 00:19:58.118\nSo I see my server,\nI see my server twice, and\n\n391\n00:19:58.118 --> 00:20:02.522\nthe reason I'm seeing it twice is I'm\nseeing is via SMB or server message block.\n\n392\n00:20:02.522 --> 00:20:05.312\nAnd I'm seeing it via AFP,\nApple file protocol.\n\n393\n00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:09.839\nWell, Time Machine works okay over SBM,\nbut it can be a little bit flakey.\n\n394\n00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:13.647\nIt works perfectly fine over AFP, and\nthe main reason is because of the file\n\n395\n00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:17.560\nmetadata that's being tracked,\nthose aliases and special access.\n\n396\n00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.130\nAFP, Apple File Protocol, does a great\njob with that, so we really prefer that.\n\n397\n00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:25.610\nUnfortunately, looking at these icons,\nI don't know which one it is.\n\n398\n00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.250\nSo I'm gonna have a 50/50\nshot of guessing right here.\n\n399\n00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.646\nNow, if I get it wrong, what would really\nbe easier is to go to the Time Machine to\n\n400\n00:20:31.646 --> 00:20:32.778\nreally just turn off SMB.\n\n401\n00:20:32.778 --> 00:20:35.620\nIf you go in your Filesharing settings,\nyou can turn it off.\n\n402\n00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.618\nBut if you're like me, they're both\non right now, so I'm gonna pick one.\n\n403\n00:20:37.618 --> 00:20:42.690\nAnd when you choose it, you can choose\nto encrypt, just like any other disk.\n\n404\n00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.160\nNow you may not want that,\nif you're a system administrator and\n\n405\n00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.830\nyou want access to these backups.\n\n406\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.790\nAnd they're encrypted and\nthe users picked their own keys,\n\n407\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.740\nthat's gonna be a bit of a challenge for\nyou, right?\n\n408\n00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.810\nSo we might not want to encrypt these and\ninstead we can use File Vault on\n\n409\n00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.820\nthe server and\nother things to kind of protect that data.\n\n410\n00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.455\nSo I'm gonna leave that off, and\nI'm just gonna choose to use it.\n\n411\n00:20:58.455 --> 00:21:00.459\nAnd I'll pick the second one,\nhoping that's AFP.\n\n412\n00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:03.564\nA lot of people don't know this, but\nApple typically defaults to SMB,\n\n413\n00:21:03.564 --> 00:21:06.070\nservice message block,\nwhich is a Microsoft protocol.\n\n414\n00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.170\nBut Apple defaults to it,\nbecause there's so\n\n415\n00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.550\nmany Microsoft machines\nthat are out there.\n\n416\n00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.930\nNow, when I choose the server tasking,\ndo I want to use both or\n\n417\n00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.290\ndo I want to replace the existing disk?\n\n418\n00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:18.640\nAnd if I use both, see how that says, Time\nMachine will take turns backing up between\n\n419\n00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.080\nthe local Time Machine disk and\nthe backup folder on the server.\n\n420\n00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.850\nI'm gonna choose to replace,\nI just wanna use the server.\n\n421\n00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.519\nAnd that way I know that's where my\nbackup's going, whenever somebody's client\n\n422\n00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:29.437\nis in the office and\nthey can see that server it'll backup.\n\n423\n00:21:29.437 --> 00:21:34.360\nAnd when they leave then it's not\ngonna backup until they get back.\n\n424\n00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.220\nSo I'll choose Replace, and\nnow it's gonna connect.\n\n425\n00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.570\nAnd if I pick the wrong protocol,\nI'm gonna get an error.\n\n426\n00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:42.750\nIf I pick the right protocol,\nI may get an authentication prompt or\n\n427\n00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.060\nit may just go ahead and\nconnect and go through.\n\n428\n00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.456\nDepending on whether I've authenticated\noff of that server or not, I think I have.\n\n429\n00:21:46.456 --> 00:21:49.994\nSo it's taking it's time,\nand when it connects,\n\n430\n00:21:49.994 --> 00:21:56.090\nwhat we should see on the server, is that\nit'll create the backups .db folder.\n\n431\n00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:00.391\nIt will create folder for this device\nwhich was called LAB-CLIENT01, and\n\n432\n00:22:00.391 --> 00:22:02.652\nthen it will initiate the first back up.\n\n433\n00:22:02.652 --> 00:22:06.190\nWhen we start backing up to the system and\nwe'll see the back up there.\n\n434\n00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.176\nAnd from then on out, it's going to\nbe populating with that information.\n\n435\n00:22:09.176 --> 00:22:12.070\nIt looks like I got lucky on this and\npicked the right one,\n\n436\n00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.525\nbecause it just initiated.\n\n437\n00:22:13.525 --> 00:22:16.090\nAnd I can see it's doing that\ntwo minute countdown, right?\n\n438\n00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.118\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; 120 seconds is counting down and\n\n439\n00:22:18.118 --> 00:22:19.660\nit's about to do the first backup.\n\n440\n00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.480\nAnd because I chose replace,\nsee how it says oldest backup, none,\n\n441\n00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.860\nlatest backup, none.\n\n442\n00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.640\nThere's no backup on the server for\nme yet.\n\n443\n00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.413\nSo it's about to start and\nit will backup to that server.\n\n444\n00:22:27.413 --> 00:22:31.515\nAnd from now on, whenever I'm on\nthe network, and I can see that server.\n\n445\n00:22:31.515 --> 00:22:34.380\nIt will start sending\nthe Time Machine backups there.\n\n446\n00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.882\nAnd I'm gonna just kinda force it,\nI'm gonna tell it to back up now, so\n\n447\n00:22:36.882 --> 00:22:37.566\nit doesn't wait.\n\n448\n00:22:37.566 --> 00:22:40.178\nAnd so now it's reaching out, see how\nit says looking for the backup disk.\n\n449\n00:22:40.178 --> 00:22:43.471\nIt's got to see if it can contact\nthe server and if it can,\n\n450\n00:22:43.471 --> 00:22:44.985\nit'll start the backup.\n\n451\n00:22:44.985 --> 00:22:49.290\nNow that backup is being written to\nthe storage on the server or will be.\n\n452\n00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.030\nAnd we'll be able to browse\ninto it on the server and\n\n453\n00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.467\nsee it there, as far as the raw files,\nit was a systems administrator.\n\n454\n00:22:53.467 --> 00:22:57.330\nYou now have a centralized place where\nyou can go to find the backup data for\n\n455\n00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.587\nyour clients and access it and restore it.\n\n456\n00:22:59.587 --> 00:23:02.826\nOr poke through it and notice through\npeople's personal documents, if you want.\n\n457\n00:23:02.826 --> 00:23:04.396\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Whatever it is that\n\n458\n00:23:04.396 --> 00:23:05.036\nyou wanna do.\n\n459\n00:23:05.036 --> 00:23:06.489\nBut it keeps-\n&gt;&gt; You've never done that, have you Don?\n\n460\n00:23:06.489 --> 00:23:07.752\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n461\n00:23:07.752 --> 00:23:10.168\nSadly, people ask me,\nand as an administrator,\n\n462\n00:23:10.168 --> 00:23:12.019\nyou sift through other people stuff.\n\n463\n00:23:12.019 --> 00:23:12.800\n&gt;&gt; Not exactly that.\n\n464\n00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.135\n&gt;&gt; And I tell them, honestly,\nI don't have time and I don't really care.\n\n465\n00:23:15.135 --> 00:23:18.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] People's information is usually\n\n466\n00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:18.828\npointless.\n\n467\n00:23:18.828 --> 00:23:20.161\n&gt;&gt; So-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n468\n00:23:20.161 --> 00:23:21.712\n&gt;&gt; Anyhow, it's gonna start that backup\n\n469\n00:23:21.712 --> 00:23:23.550\nand we'll see it appear\non the server in time.\n\n470\n00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.836\nIn fact, if I jump over to the server and\nI go to my Backups tab,\n\n471\n00:23:26.836 --> 00:23:29.573\nI can see where LAB-CLIENT01\nis now connected.\n\n472\n00:23:29.573 --> 00:23:32.943\nI can see the owner, I was logged\nin as HelpDesk when I did it, and\n\n473\n00:23:32.943 --> 00:23:34.451\nI can see the latest backup.\n\n474\n00:23:34.451 --> 00:23:37.828\nThe latest backup right now is unknown,\nbut it is actually running.\n\n475\n00:23:37.828 --> 00:23:39.987\nSee how my total size is 695 megabytes?\n\n476\n00:23:39.987 --> 00:23:43.957\nIt's already started the backup,\nit's just in the process.\n\n477\n00:23:43.957 --> 00:23:44.514\n&gt;&gt; It has to be complete, right?\n\n478\n00:23:44.514 --> 00:23:45.585\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Before it shows the time.\n\n479\n00:23:45.585 --> 00:23:49.202\n&gt;&gt; So you could come in here in theory,\nat the beginning of a day and\n\n480\n00:23:49.202 --> 00:23:50.581\nsort by latest backup.\n\n481\n00:23:50.581 --> 00:23:53.859\nAnd look for machines that didn't\nbackup in the last 24 hours.\n\n482\n00:23:53.859 --> 00:23:56.590\nYou can get an idea who's been\nbacking up and who hasn't.\n\n483\n00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.900\nBut you can also just see each of\nthe people that backed up here.\n\n484\n00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.710\nAnd on you disk, if you browse\ninto the storage of the server,\n\n485\n00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:08.250\nyou'd be able to browse into it and\ngo into the Backups folder.\n\n486\n00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:14.222\nAnd each computer will have its own entry\nin here and you'll see their backups.\n\n487\n00:24:14.222 --> 00:24:17.740\nAnd that way, you'll be able to see\nthem and basically access each one and\n\n488\n00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.347\ntake them and restore from them.\n\n489\n00:24:19.347 --> 00:24:23.111\nYou can restore via the network or you\ncan even copy them to an external drive.\n\n490\n00:24:23.111 --> 00:24:26.119\nAnd use that to restore from to\nbring somebody's machine back on,\n\n491\n00:24:26.119 --> 00:24:28.090\nbut now you've got centralized backups.\n\n492\n00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:31.540\nAnd all that we did different on\nthe client side, was that when we chose\n\n493\n00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:36.120\nSelect Disk, we just picked a network\nlocation instead of a local disk.\n\n494\n00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.081\nAnd now off it goes, backing up.\n\n495\n00:24:37.081 --> 00:24:39.866\nIt can take 27 minutes which is\na little bit long, but remember,\n\n496\n00:24:39.866 --> 00:24:41.175\nit's going over the network.\n\n497\n00:24:41.175 --> 00:24:44.136\nNnetworks are usually slower,\nspecially wireless networks, and so\n\n498\n00:24:44.136 --> 00:24:46.940\nit can just take a bit more time,\nwithout initial backup run.\n\n499\n00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.590\n&gt;&gt; And Don, is this still using\nthat local cache data, so\n\n500\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.770\nwhen you're not connected to your network\nit's still kinda taking the backup?\n\n501\n00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:53.635\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean unless you turn it off.\n\n502\n00:24:53.635 --> 00:24:55.012\n&gt;&gt; Those thing is-\n&gt;&gt; Then.\n\n503\n00:24:55.012 --> 00:24:55.608\n&gt;&gt; Sill same.\n\n504\n00:24:55.608 --> 00:24:56.695\n&gt;&gt; Even when you can't see the server,\n\n505\n00:24:56.695 --> 00:24:58.320\nit will backup to that mobile\nbackup in slash volumes.\n\n506\n00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.502\nAnd that will be there and\nthen when it connect to server,\n\n507\n00:25:00.502 --> 00:25:02.962\nit will synch that all back up and\nthen you're back in business.\n\n508\n00:25:02.962 --> 00:25:05.760\n&gt;&gt; Well very cool,\nnow we have our Marvel after the credits.\n\n509\n00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.429\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n510\n00:25:07.429 --> 00:25:08.974\n&gt;&gt; Real abilities are trail for you guys.\n\n511\n00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:13.495\nAnd we've completed how to use\nnetwork solution as well as local\n\n512\n00:25:13.495 --> 00:25:16.604\nbackup storage for\nyou to use Time Machine.\n\n513\n00:25:16.604 --> 00:25:20.680\nVery cool stuff like we said there's no\ngood reason to not be using this because\n\n514\n00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.981\nit's not if you fail, it's when you fail.\n\n515\n00:25:22.981 --> 00:25:28.569\nAnd you don't wanna lose your data,\nso just go grab you a drive,\n\n516\n00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:32.620\nget online solution with the server,\nright?\n\n517\n00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.915\nSet that up if you've got a large\nenough network in your house or\n\n518\n00:25:34.915 --> 00:25:37.490\nif you're using a small business,\nsomething to that effect.\n\n519\n00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.720\nJust turn it on and make sure you're doing\nbackups and check them on a regular basis.\n\n520\n00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.249\nThat being said, Don, it looks like\nwe've ran out of time for this episode.\n\n521\n00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.963\nNo pun intended, right?\n\n522\n00:25:45.963 --> 00:25:48.834\n[LAUGH] We do thank you guys for\nwatching,

00:00:08.414\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:12.336\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:14.650\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.490\nYou're watching the Apple Certified\nSupport Professional for macOS Sierra.\n\n7\n00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.900\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today,\nwe're gonna be taking a look and\n\n8\n00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.290\nlearning more about managing applications.\n\n9\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.930\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.280\nDon, welcome back to the studios.\n\n11\n00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.560\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back Ronnie, ready\nto dive right back into the world of ASCP.\n\n12\n00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.730\nIn this episode,\n\n13\n00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.530\nwe're gonna be taking a look at the\napplications that we load on top of macOS.\n\n14\n00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.870\nNow when you buy a new Mac, it already\nhave macOS on it, so that kinda makes life\n\n15\n00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.870\neasier, or maybe you upgrade it, it's not\na big deal, Apple doesn't charge you for\n\n16\n00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.580\nit, you just upgrade it and\nyou're running macOS Sierra.\n\n17\n00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.810\nAnd it has a handful of applications that\nare included with the operating system.\n\n18\n00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.130\nMany of them like the little text\nedit utility is just part of the OS,\n\n19\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.080\nit's there, it's not very fancy, it's not\nsomething you're gonna fall in love with.\n\n20\n00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.590\nBut other applications like pages and\nnumbers, GarageBand,\n\n21\n00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.180\niMovie, those little projects,\nthere's actually really powerful and\n\n22\n00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.920\npeople love them, and they're\nincluded with the operating system.\n\n23\n00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.030\nAnd if that's all you need, then you can\nstop this episode right here because\n\n24\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.430\nthe built in applications are included,\nthey work, they're great, there you go.\n\n25\n00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.150\nBut for most of us, we're gonna end up\ninstalling at least one other application.\n\n26\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.640\nThere's always something that\nthe base operating system\n\n27\n00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.350\ndoesn't meet your needs for.\n\n28\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.360\nOr you might end up like me where\nI've installed, I don't know,\n\n29\n00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.160\nprobably 100 different somethings\nwhere the base operating system\n\n30\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.806\nwasn't able to provide exactly what\nI needed and that's perfectly fine.\n\n31\n00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:40.070\nThat's how Apple has designed\nthis operating system and\n\n32\n00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.860\nreally how every operating system works,\n\n33\n00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.020\nis the operating system is really just\nthere to make your hardware function.\n\n34\n00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.490\nAnd then the applications\nyou load on top of it,\n\n35\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.000\nis where you really take\nadvantage of your device.\n\n36\n00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.300\nAnd they let the other companies out there\nspecialize in the software they make.\n\n37\n00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.900\nSo, if I want to have a fully\nfeatured database software,\n\n38\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.490\nwell, Apple doesn't have that, right?\n\n39\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.670\nI mean they've got\nwhat's that little card?\n\n40\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.680\nI can't remember their card program.\n\n41\n00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.380\nIt's in there, it's very, very basic.\n\n42\n00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.160\nBut if I want to jump up to something\nlike Microsoft Access or Oracle or\n\n43\n00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.170\nwhatever, they're way more powerful\nthan what a little card program can do.\n\n44\n00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.540\nAnd Apple says hey, that's great.\n\n45\n00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.300\nGo with those guys.\n\n46\n00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.360\nGo with those third parties.\n\n47\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.130\nThey specialize in that software.\n\n48\n00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.300\nAnd most of them make a Mac\nversion that you can run,\n\n49\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.100\nand now you've got that software.\n\n50\n00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.990\nBut when we go out and\n\n51\n00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.110\nwe get these applications,\nthat's where the real danger comes in.\n\n52\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.810\nIf you run just the base install of macOS,\nand you never install a third party\n\n53\n00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.740\napplication on there,\nit's actually really, really safe.\n\n54\n00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.230\nThere's very few exploits and\n\n55\n00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.740\nvulnerabilities available in\nthe base operating system.\n\n56\n00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.160\nAnd it gives you a very stable,\nvery secure environment.\n\n57\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.140\nBut when we start loading on\nthese third party applications,\n\n58\n00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.350\nthat's when the system starts to\nget weaker and weaker and weaker.\n\n59\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.110\nAnd that causes some problems, right?\n\n60\n00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.460\nAnd it puts us at risk.\n\n61\n00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.980\nSo we need to be aware of how those\napplications work, where we can get them\n\n62\n00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.740\nfrom and just the various concerns\nof loading third party applications.\n\n63\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.010\nSo that we can be aware of that and\n\n64\n00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.095\nmake sure that we are getting\nthings from a safe source.\n\n65\n00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:19.465\nAll right, so let's talk about\nthe two supported modes for\n\n66\n00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:20.810\ngetting apps inside a macOS.\n\n67\n00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.015\nThere's actually three supported modes but\nin exam they say two and I'll explain why.\n\n68\n00:03:25.015 --> 00:03:28.497\nThe first mode is from the App Store,\nright?\n\n69\n00:03:28.497 --> 00:03:31.497\nIn macOS, we've got the macOS App Store,\nit's packed full of apps and\n\n70\n00:03:31.497 --> 00:03:33.047\nyou can go and you can download them.\n\n71\n00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:35.296\nMost of them are pay,\nyou gotta pay for them.\n\n72\n00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:39.276\nThere's very few free apps inside of the\nApp Store because Apple charges vendors\n\n73\n00:03:39.276 --> 00:03:42.717\nregardless of whether they charge for\ntheir product or not.\n\n74\n00:03:42.717 --> 00:03:46.600\nSo if you have a free program and\nyou put it in the App Store, it's free but\n\n75\n00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.270\nyou've got to pay Apple to have it hosted,\nso it's a little bit problematic.\n\n76\n00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.520\nBut there's plenty of stuff there,\nso that's source number one.\n\n77\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.730\nSource number two is you can go out and\n\n78\n00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.590\nyou can just download apps from any\nperson's website, assuming that the vendor\n\n79\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.750\nwho wrote that app registered it with\nApple and got it digitally signed.\n\n80\n00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.240\nIf they're a provider that has\na developer license with Apple so\n\n81\n00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.920\nthey can digitally sign the app,\nall right?\n\n82\n00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.070\nThose are the two official sources\nyou'll see on the exam for\n\n83\n00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.380\ngetting apps, from the App Store or\n\n84\n00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.270\nfrom certified Apple developers that\nhave digitally signed applications.\n\n85\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.530\nBut there is a third.\n\n86\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.610\nAnd the third are developers that create\nthe app, and never talk to Apple at all.\n\n87\n00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.370\nThey don't have a developer account\nwith Apple, they don't digitally\n\n88\n00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.220\nsign their app, they just write an app and\nsay, here it is, it worked, take it.\n\n89\n00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.290\nAnd we're not gonna get Apple involved.\n\n90\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.080\nWell, that type of application is\nactually blocked by macOS by default,\n\n91\n00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.040\nyou can't run it.\n\n92\n00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.882\nThere's a program in the background\ncalled Gatekeeper, and\n\n93\n00:04:47.882 --> 00:04:50.951\nGatekeeper runs to prevent\napplications like that from running.\n\n94\n00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:56.250\nBecause normally, those type of\napplications can be risky at best.\n\n95\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.177\nIf you don't trust the developer,\nif you don't know what they're doing,\n\n96\n00:04:59.177 --> 00:05:01.340\nit hasn't being reviewed,\nit hasn't been examined.\n\n97\n00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.906\nAnd that means you could have\nthings like Trojan Horses or\n\n98\n00:05:03.906 --> 00:05:07.440\nviruses that are attached to those\napplications, and you wouldn't know it.\n\n99\n00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.160\nViruses, they're just applications too,\nand you know they're not digitally signed\n\n100\n00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.360\nby Apple and they're not allowed\nto be hosted in the App Store.\n\n101\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.140\nSo if we block that type of application,\nin effect we block most viruses.\n\n102\n00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.430\nMost of the types of attacks you\ncan get on a system are blocked\n\n103\n00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.000\nbecause of that protection.\n\n104\n00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.460\nSo, let's talk a little bit\nabout the App Store first.\n\n105\n00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.436\nNow, I'll go through each of\nthese three scenarios and\n\n106\n00:05:25.436 --> 00:05:26.624\nkind of how we can work with them.\n\n107\n00:05:26.624 --> 00:05:28.361\nBut we'll start with the App Store, and\n\n108\n00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:31.110\nhow those apps work and\nmove on from there.\n\n109\n00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.624\nNow the App Store itself,\nit's installed by default, right?\n\n110\n00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:36.270\nSo here, this is my laptop and\nif I just go down here to my docker,\n\n111\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.749\nthe app store is in your dock by default,\nI've got some other icons I've added, but\n\n112\n00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:41.415\nyou'll usually at least have that one.\n\n113\n00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:44.770\nAnd we can fire up the App Store and\nwe can see apps.\n\n114\n00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.650\nVery important mission-critical apps.\n\n115\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.940\nI need to get Mafia III installed\nright away and OmniOutliner 5,\n\n116\n00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.780\nand mnml, whatever that is.\n\n117\n00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.360\nSo, sometimes the applications\nare utilities, tools,\n\n118\n00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.380\nthings that we can use for our job or\nto make our computer run better.\n\n119\n00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.140\nOther times there are Micky Mouse\nCastle Adventure and it's funny games.\n\n120\n00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.980\nApple doesn't, they don't point fingers.\n\n121\n00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.010\nThey just say, look, our computers can be\nused for a number of different things.\n\n122\n00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.450\nWe're going to have apps across the board\nand the reality is in these App Stores,\n\n123\n00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.150\nusually the video games\nmake the most money.\n\n124\n00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.540\nSo, they feature those.\n\n125\n00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.070\nBut, you will see things like, here,\nthis is a Vectr Graphics Editor or\n\n126\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.350\nInteract Scratchpad or notes utility.\n\n127\n00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.940\nThose are useful things.\n\n128\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.310\nI might never have heard\nof Interact before, right?\n\n129\n00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.310\nI don't know what is.\n\n130\n00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.680\nAnd I'm actually telling the truth,\nI've never heard of Interact before.\n\n131\n00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.230\nSo, what if I want to try it out, right?\n\n132\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.900\nWhat if I say okay, well, I'm gonna go up\nhere to the search, and let me search for\n\n133\n00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.100\nthis Interact notepad thing,\nInteract Scratchpad, all right?\n\n134\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.330\nIt's $5, right?\n\n135\n00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.590\nSo, I can see it's not free,\nit does cost a few bucks, and then,\n\n136\n00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.100\nit's telling me I can\nconvert my text to contacts.\n\n137\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.290\nI've never needed to do that,\nbut if I needed to do that,\n\n138\n00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.800\nhere's an app that will do it, right?\n\n139\n00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.030\nSo, do I trust this developer?\n\n140\n00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.170\nNo, I've never heard of them.\n\n141\n00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.110\nThis is the very first time I\nhave heard of this application,\n\n142\n00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.540\nin fact I don't even know\nthe developer's name.\n\n143\n00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.480\nIt's down here, it is Agile Tortoise.\n\n144\n00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.451\nOkay, well, I have never seen it,\nAgile Tortoise.\n\n145\n00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:11.399\nSo I already don't know if I can trust\nthis company cuz their name make no sense.\n\n146\n00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:17.980\nBut by having the app loaded in the App\nStore, I know that Apple reviewed the app.\n\n147\n00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.570\nThey looked at it, they checked to\nmake sure there were no viruses or\n\n148\n00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.360\nTrojans that had followed some\nbasic security principles.\n\n149\n00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.610\nThat they didn't violate copyright laws.\n\n150\n00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.920\nThey made sure that it\nmet a minimum standard.\n\n151\n00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.510\nAnd then, they digitally signed the\napplication and put it in the App Store.\n\n152\n00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.740\nNow I've mentioned that digital\nsignature more than once.\n\n153\n00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.010\nThe digital signature serves two purposes.\n\n154\n00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.190\nPurpose number one is to\nidentify who made the app, right?\n\n155\n00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.630\nSo I know that it went\nthrough Apple's process, and\n\n156\n00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.930\nthat it was made by Agile Tortoise, right?\n\n157\n00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.011\nGreat, so I know that.\n\n158\n00:07:47.011 --> 00:07:51.080\nAnd then two, it ensure the application\nhasn't been tampered with.\n\n159\n00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.633\nIf the application is modified in any way,\nthe digital signature fails.\n\n160\n00:07:55.633 --> 00:07:59.416\nSo now I know not only am I getting\nan app that's been reviewed by Apple, but\n\n161\n00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:03.575\nI know it's in the original unmodified\nform, and it hasn't been tampered with.\n\n162\n00:08:03.575 --> 00:08:04.908\nI know it's safe.\n\n163\n00:08:04.908 --> 00:08:07.760\nWhen I get apps from the App Store,\nI know they're safe.\n\n164\n00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.460\nNow, that being said,\nthere is some downside to this, right?\n\n165\n00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.400\nThe positives are we get safety,\n\n166\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.830\nwe get security,\nwe also get automatic updates, right?\n\n167\n00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.110\nSo as new versions of this app come out,\n\n168\n00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.580\nI can just go to my updates menu and\nwe get updates.\n\n169\n00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.620\nSo, you'll see some of the applications\nthat I've bought over the years\n\n170\n00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.670\nlike Serial.\n\n171\n00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.720\nSerial is one I use quite a bit actually.\n\n172\n00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.910\nIt is a serial console emulator.\n\n173\n00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:36.690\nIt lets me connect to like Cisco routers\nand switches with a console cable and\n\n174\n00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.070\ncommunicate to them via that com port.\n\n175\n00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.813\nWell, the Serial application it took\nan update, says here, installed May 8th,\n\n176\n00:08:43.813 --> 00:08:44.504\n2017.\n\n177\n00:08:44.504 --> 00:08:46.890\nSo it actually took an update\nabout four days ago.\n\n178\n00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.570\nI don't remember that.\n\n179\n00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.850\nThat's because it was an update\nthat was installed automatically.\n\n180\n00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.830\nI have automatic updates turned on, so\n\n181\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.010\nthese applications\nare updating on their own.\n\n182\n00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.510\nI can see that Keynote took\nan update on April 28th.\n\n183\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.460\nI didn't know that.\n\n184\n00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.850\nIt just did it in the background.\n\n185\n00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.600\nSo, automatic updates are really handy.\n\n186\n00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.140\nWhen I install from a vendor's website,\nand the application changes,\n\n187\n00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.800\nI need to go back to that vendor's\nwebsite and download the application, or\n\n188\n00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.110\nmaybe they've written their\nown auto update process.\n\n189\n00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.660\nBut if not, well, I have to do it by hand.\n\n190\n00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.710\nHere in the App Store,\nthese happen automatically.\n\n191\n00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.050\nI don't even realize these\nthings are updating.\n\n192\n00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:23.120\nIt's just happening in the background,\nwhich is really a nice feature to have.\n\n193\n00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.500\nSo those are some of\nthe benefits of the App Store.\n\n194\n00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.080\nOn the negative side there's\na cost to the vendor,\n\n195\n00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.770\nthe vendor has to share some\nof their profits with Apple.\n\n196\n00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.730\nAnd as a result,\nthe price of applications is usually\n\n197\n00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.710\nhigher in the app store than it\nis on actual vendor's website.\n\n198\n00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.193\nThere are many examples where\nyou can come in here and\n\n199\n00:09:40.193 --> 00:09:44.436\nfind an app that might be $20 and you go\nto the vendor's website and it's only $10.\n\n200\n00:09:44.436 --> 00:09:49.430\nWell, why would I pay more for the app?\n\n201\n00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.650\nWell there's a few reasons, right?\n\n202\n00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.160\nSo again, there's the Apple safety,\nthat we know we have that.\n\n203\n00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.650\nWe know that we can get automatic updates.\n\n204\n00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.550\nWe also know that thanks\nto Apple's Family Handling,\n\n205\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.465\nwe can install the app on up\nto five computers, right?\n\n206\n00:10:01.465 --> 00:10:03.220\nVersus if I go to the vendor's website and\n\n207\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.838\nI get a license key from them, well, I can\nusually only use that on one computer.\n\n208\n00:10:07.838 --> 00:10:10.560\nSo you normally get a little bit more\nflexibility as far as your installs\n\n209\n00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.460\nare concerned.\n\n210\n00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.200\nAnd with the App Store have one place\nto go if you wanna reinstall your apps.\n\n211\n00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.660\nIt just makes life a little bit easier,\nbut it is more expensive.\n\n212\n00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.200\nNow you can go to the vendor's website,\nand so\n\n213\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.990\nthat's kinda the second source, right?\n\n214\n00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.805\nThere is an app I use called ForkLift and\nI use it all the time.\n\n215\n00:10:26.805 --> 00:10:28.140\nIt's a file manager.\n\n216\n00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.200\nHere it is, the ForkLift file manager.\n\n217\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.950\nAnd if I remember correctly,\nhere in the App Store,\n\n218\n00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:37.010\nit's $20 or $19.99,\nsomething along that price point.\n\n219\n00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.010\nAnd so here's ForkLift the File Manager.\n\n220\n00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.740\nAnd you can see that I can get it, right?\n\n221\n00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.220\nGet it means I can download it and\ninstall it.\n\n222\n00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.170\nAnd it's free, right,\nthe price over here is free.\n\n223\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.990\nNow, I just said it was $20.\n\n224\n00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.380\nWell, some apps have an in-app purchase\nto unlock their full functionality.\n\n225\n00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.345\nOther apps might genuinely be free.\n\n226\n00:10:55.345 --> 00:10:58.697\nhis one actually has in-app purchases\nto unlock the full functionality and\n\n227\n00:10:58.697 --> 00:11:01.118\nit ends up being,\nI believe it's $20, all right?\n\n228\n00:11:01.118 --> 00:11:05.000\nNow, notice how it says get,\nbut I can run ForkLift.\n\n229\n00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.690\nI've got it installed\nright here on my laptop.\n\n230\n00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.439\nI use it every day.\n\n231\n00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.270\nI didn't get it from the App Store.\n\n232\n00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.240\nThe reason is, I went and\nI bought it from the vendor's website.\n\n233\n00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.660\nIf I go and pull up their website,\nlet's pull up forklift.\n\n234\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.200\nThe company has a weird name it's\n\n235\n00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.500\nlike binary-\n&gt;&gt; Nights.\n\n236\n00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.630\n&gt;&gt; Binary Nights, that's it.\n\n237\n00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.560\nSo if I go to their website.\n\n238\n00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.820\nHere is ForkLift3, I can download it.\n\n239\n00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.230\nI can hit the Download button or\nI can buy it and pay the $20 or\n\n240\n00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.710\nwhatever the pricing was.\n\n241\n00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:36.450\nNow, for them, the price is the same in\nthe App Store as it is on their website.\n\n242\n00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.940\nSo, if there's no difference, I might as\nwell just go get it from the App Store and\n\n243\n00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.210\nget my automatic updates.\n\n244\n00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:40.830\nBut I didn't do that.\n\n245\n00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:46.140\nAnd the reason is, binarynights is\na registered Apple developer, right?\n\n246\n00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.840\nSo they've got a developer account.\n\n247\n00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.810\nTheir application is digitally signed,\nwhether I get it from them or\n\n248\n00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.900\nwhether I get it from the App Store.\n\n249\n00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.710\nI bought it from them for\na specific reason.\n\n250\n00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:56.880\nIf I go back to the App Store and\n\n251\n00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.870\nlook at their app description,\nyou can see this note right here.\n\n252\n00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:04.270\nNOTE: App Store versions do not\ncontain the Disklet feature, and\n\n253\n00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.400\ncannot perform privileged file operations.\n\n254\n00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.840\nWhat does that mean?\n\n255\n00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.490\nWell, apps that you download from the\nApp Store are what are called sandboxed.\n\n256\n00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.580\nThey're isolated, they can't\ninteract with other applications.\n\n257\n00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.370\nThey can't interact with areas of the file\nsystem that are outside of what they're\n\n258\n00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.580\nsupposed to effect.\n\n259\n00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.350\nThey're effectively crippled.\n\n260\n00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.630\nWell, if it's a video game,\nit doesn't matter, right?\n\n261\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.040\nIf it's a notepad editor,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n262\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.532\nBut, if it's a file system utility like\nthis and I want to be able to format a USB\n\n263\n00:12:33.532 --> 00:12:38.319\nkey from inside of the file utility, you\ncan't do that with the App Store version.\n\n264\n00:12:38.319 --> 00:12:41.350\nIt's sandboxed,\nit's not allowed to format disks.\n\n265\n00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.520\nBecause in theory you could have\na virus that formated disks, right?\n\n266\n00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.220\nHere in the App Store utility it's safer,\nit's got more restrictions on it.\n\n267\n00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.560\nBut when the developer puts\nit on their own website\n\n268\n00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.410\nthey don't have to follow those rules.\n\n269\n00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.360\nThe app gets digitally signed to show it\nhasn't been tampered with, but it doesn't\n\n270\n00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.440\ngo through Apple's tests to make sure that\nit's sandboxed and isolated, and safe.\n\n271\n00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.310\nAnd so when you buy it from their website,\n\n272\n00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.418\nyou actually get additional\nfeatures like that disklet utility.\n\n273\n00:13:09.418 --> 00:13:13.179\nThe disklet utility,\nthis isn't a ForkLift show but\n\n274\n00:13:13.179 --> 00:13:18.277\nthe disklet utility lets you take\ncloud storage, things like Dropbox or\n\n275\n00:13:18.277 --> 00:13:22.560\nAmazon S3, and mount it as if\nit was a USB key on your system.\n\n276\n00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.926\nSo it shows up as a hard drive,\n\n277\n00:13:23.926 --> 00:13:25.450\nand you can browse right into it and\nhit this cloud.\n\n278\n00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.950\nSo it's really cool it's one\nof my favorite features.\n\n279\n00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.350\nBut, not supported in\nthe App Store version.\n\n280\n00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.000\nSo be aware there is a difference.\n\n281\n00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.480\nYou might have the exact same app from\nthe vendor or from the App Store,\n\n282\n00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.250\nand there might be certain functionality\nmissing from the App Store version.\n\n283\n00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.180\nAlso, if an update comes out,\n\n284\n00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.540\na vendor can release an update\non their website right away.\n\n285\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:49.400\nBut in the App Store they have to submit\nthe app to Apple, and Apple tests it and\n\n286\n00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.060\nruns it through checking again\nbefore publishing it in the store.\n\n287\n00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.630\nSo the versions that you find in\nthe App Store are usually a bit behind\n\n288\n00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.850\nwhat's available on the website.\n\n289\n00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.150\nThat's a reason to go to\nthe vendor's website.\n\n290\n00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.610\nWell what are the negatives of\ngoing to the vendor website?\n\n291\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.620\nWell if you want a refund,\nwell getting a refund through Apple is\n\n292\n00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.930\npractically a guarantee, getting it\nthrough a vendor is a different story.\n\n293\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.250\nLicensing as you move from computer to\ncomputer the vendor might not allow you to\n\n294\n00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.630\nmove your license to another machine.\n\n295\n00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.320\nSo you buy a new Mac and now you've\ngotta buy a new copy of that software.\n\n296\n00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.750\nThey may do that,\nnot all of them do, but some do.\n\n297\n00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:24.670\nYou also have the risk of\nthe application being corrupt or\n\n298\n00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.620\nhaving a virus, cuz you can digitally\nsign it, even if it's got a virus in it.\n\n299\n00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.970\nIt just shows as being\nfrom that vendor and\n\n300\n00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:32.590\nas soon as Apple finds out,\nApple revokes the certificate.\n\n301\n00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.369\nAnd that stops the app from working, but\n\n302\n00:14:34.369 --> 00:14:37.156\nit didn't help you if you've\nalready gotten the app, right?\n\n303\n00:14:37.156 --> 00:14:39.630\nThen you've already gotten infected,\nso it doesn't help.\n\n304\n00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.830\nSo that's kind of the risk of\ngoing with the third route.\n\n305\n00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.630\nThere's pros and cons from both and\nsometimes you got to choose.\n\n306\n00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.630\nIn this case, I chose to go with\nthe vendor because I specifically wanted\n\n307\n00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:48.240\nthat functionality.\n\n308\n00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.440\nBut there's plenty of other things, like\nyou saw I had Jump Desktop that I bought\n\n309\n00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.200\nthrough the App Store because\nI wanted automatic updates and\n\n310\n00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.180\nI wanted to install it on\nmore than one computer.\n\n311\n00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.391\nThat's why I got it through the App Store.\n\n312\n00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:02.818\nThose are all considerations\nwe need to make.\n\n313\n00:15:02.818 --> 00:15:08.030\nNow, when we have an application that is\nneither of those, not from the App Store,\n\n314\n00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:12.050\nnot digitally signed, then behaviors\nstart to get a little weird, right?\n\n315\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.600\nAnd I wanna give you guys an example.\n\n316\n00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.555\nThere's a BitTorrent client\ncalled Transmission.\n\n317\n00:15:16.555 --> 00:15:19.350\nTransmissionbt.com.\n\n318\n00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.440\nThere we go.\n[COUGH] It's\n\n319\n00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.090\na bit torrent client, it's free.\n\n320\n00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.540\nIt's not in the App Store.\n\n321\n00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.310\nYou can go to their website and\nyou can download it, and\n\n322\n00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.840\nyou can use it to transfer\nfiles via bit torrent.\n\n323\n00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.978\nWell they had a compromise\na few months ago.\n\n324\n00:15:30.978 --> 00:15:34.480\nHackers broke into their\ndownload server and\n\n325\n00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.545\nchanged the version of transmission to\nhave a Trojan horse attached to it.\n\n326\n00:15:38.545 --> 00:15:41.080\nIt actually had ransomware,\nwhere it'd encrypt your files and\n\n327\n00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.040\nmake you pay bit coin to unlock it.\n\n328\n00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.460\nWell, you wouldn't have\nknown that happened\n\n329\n00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.530\nbecause there is no digital\nsignature attached to it.\n\n330\n00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.380\nThere is no Apple doing a test on it.\n\n331\n00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.714\nYou would download it and\nyou'd get infected.\n\n332\n00:15:55.714 --> 00:15:58.676\nAnd so after that, they kind of learned\ntheir lesson and when you go to\n\n333\n00:15:58.676 --> 00:16:02.048\nthe download page, you've got the download\nlink to download their client and\n\n334\n00:16:02.048 --> 00:16:04.112\nright beneath it they\nhave a SHA256 Hashes.\n\n335\n00:16:04.112 --> 00:16:08.120\nSo you can run a hashing check against the\nfile to make sure it hasn't been modified.\n\n336\n00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.857\nThis is kinda like their own\nsignature they're doing.\n\n337\n00:16:10.857 --> 00:16:12.554\nBut there's two problems with this.\n\n338\n00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:15.494\nProblem number one, if a hacker can\nbreak into your download server, they\n\n339\n00:16:15.494 --> 00:16:18.730\ncan more than likely break into your web\nserver and change the hash on the website.\n\n340\n00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.640\nSo now you can't trust the hash, right?\n\n341\n00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.410\nProblem number two, most users don't\nknow how to check a hash, right?\n\n342\n00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:30.520\nSo there's a SHA command line utility or\nan md5sum utility that you can use.\n\n343\n00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.420\nTo be able to check signatures to make\nsure files haven't been tampered with.\n\n344\n00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.340\nBut it's not easy.\n\n345\n00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.130\nAnd most users don't know how to do it.\n\n346\n00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.444\nAnd that's why we generally wanna stay\naway from applications downloaded from\n\n347\n00:16:39.444 --> 00:16:40.610\nvendor websites.\n\n348\n00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.580\nAnd Gatekeeper is helping to enforce that.\n\n349\n00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.057\nIf we take an application, and\nI've already downloaded a copy of well,\n\n350\n00:16:47.057 --> 00:16:49.053\nI've got a couple of applications here.\n\n351\n00:16:49.053 --> 00:16:53.440\nSo I've got Transmission that I\ndownloaded from their website.\n\n352\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.720\nAnd I've got Openshot.\n\n353\n00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.930\nWhich is a video editor that I\nuse on a pretty regular basis.\n\n354\n00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.640\nI downloaded it from their website also.\n\n355\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.360\nNeither these two products\nare available in the App Store.\n\n356\n00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.567\nAnd when you go to install them,\nwell you open up the dmg and\n\n357\n00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:09.233\nyou've got the application file\nthat you can just take and drag and\n\n358\n00:17:09.233 --> 00:17:11.870\ndrop into your applications folders,\nright?\n\n359\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:15.015\nSo I'm gonna go to my applications\nfolder here in the background And\n\n360\n00:17:15.015 --> 00:17:17.650\nI'll just drag and\ndrop Transmission in there.\n\n361\n00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:22.780\nOkay, now once I do that, I've now\neffectively installed Transmission, right?\n\n362\n00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.960\nAnd I can find it here in my list,\nand I can go to open it.\n\n363\n00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.290\nAnd instead of opening,\nI get this warning.\n\n364\n00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.210\nTransmission is an application\ndownloaded from the Internet.\n\n365\n00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.960\nAre you sure you wanna open it?\n\n366\n00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.430\nGoogle Chrome downloaded it today\nat 9:44 AM and here's where it was.\n\n367\n00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.710\nOkay, this is Gatekeeper.\n\n368\n00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:44.990\nGatekeeper is stepping in and\nsaying I don't trust this application.\n\n369\n00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.210\nAre you sure you wanna open it?\n\n370\n00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.320\nNow the fact that I'm seeing this screen\nright here tells me that they actually did\n\n371\n00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.290\ndigitally sign their application.\n\n372\n00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.980\nApparently they got an Apple\ndeveloper account and signed it.\n\n373\n00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.900\nOtherwise, I would be seeing a page\nhere that just had cancel and\n\n374\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.210\nshow web page that wouldn't\nhave an open button.\n\n375\n00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:04.260\nIf it's not signed at all,\nit stops you from opening it.\n\n376\n00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.920\nWell an administrator can open it.\n\n377\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:11.570\nAn administrator can control click or\nright click on it and choose open.\n\n378\n00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.860\nAnd when they do that, even if it\ndoesn't have a digital signature,\n\n379\n00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.630\nthat'll make the open button appear.\n\n380\n00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.044\nAnd then they can choose to open\nthe application, and it will launch, and\n\n381\n00:18:20.044 --> 00:18:21.820\nit only asks the first time you run it.\n\n382\n00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.870\nOnce you've run it one time,\nthen, it's now good.\n\n383\n00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.260\nNow it's trusted by the system.\n\n384\n00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.409\nYou've approved it in GateKeeper,\nand it's Is up and\n\n385\n00:18:29.409 --> 00:18:32.166\ngoing, and mine launched in\nthe background for whatever reason, but\n\n386\n00:18:32.166 --> 00:18:34.845\nthere it is and\nnow I'm running that transmission client.\n\n387\n00:18:34.845 --> 00:18:36.525\nOkay, but there was no check.\n\n388\n00:18:36.525 --> 00:18:39.981\nMy system can be infected right now, I\ndon't really know, I would need to go and\n\n389\n00:18:39.981 --> 00:18:43.655\ncheck, make sure it hasn't been tampered\nwith and make sure I trusted this vendor.\n\n390\n00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:45.895\nSo we generally don't wanna\ndo this if we can avoid it.\n\n391\n00:18:45.895 --> 00:18:49.830\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, if Gatekeeper is running and\nlet's say that I accidentally\n\n392\n00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:54.690\njust clicked open, and I realized, it's\nnot something I want to run all the time.\n\n393\n00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.601\nDoes Gatekeeper allow me\nto change that action,\n\n394\n00:18:57.601 --> 00:19:00.300\nsince it said I only have\nto allow it one time?\n\n395\n00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you delete the app.\n\n396\n00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.840\nOnce you delete the app, so,\nI don't actually want Transmission.\n\n397\n00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.180\nSo if I went to my application\nfolder here, I can find it.\n\n398\n00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.674\nAnd if I just drag and\ndrop it into the trash, right,\n\n399\n00:19:10.674 --> 00:19:12.400\nthat resets it in Gatekeeper.\n\n400\n00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.320\nSo if I ever install it again,\nit will actually prompt me, and\n\n401\n00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.610\nI can run through that process again.\n\n402\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.720\nAnother thing we can do is, maybe I\n\n403\n00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.790\ndon't want to allow apps to be installed\noutside of the App Store, or whatever.\n\n404\n00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.390\nIf you go into your System Preferences,\ninside of System Preferences,\n\n405\n00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.820\nyou can go to Security &amp; Privacy.\n\n406\n00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:35.100\nAnd in Security &amp; Privacy,\nright here under General,\n\n407\n00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.690\nyou'll see Allow apps downloaded from and\nthere's two options, right?\n\n408\n00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.020\nI can restrict myself\nto just the App Store.\n\n409\n00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.770\nI only want to allow\napps from the App Store.\n\n410\n00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.790\nOr I can say app store and\nidentified developers,\n\n411\n00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:51.160\nwhich is what I'm set at, which is why\nI was allowed to install Transmission.\n\n412\n00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.110\nThey're an identified developer.\n\n413\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.750\nThey actually did have a certificate of\nmapoffs, I'm kinda surprised to see that.\n\n414\n00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:00.540\nIt used to cost, I think it was a $100\na year, now they've lowered that.\n\n415\n00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.280\nI think you actually get a free\nlicence now so, more and\n\n416\n00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.330\nmore people are signing their apps.\n\n417\n00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:05.600\nWhich is a good thing right?\n\n418\n00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.840\nHopefully we can verify apps\nhaven't been tampered with.\n\n419\n00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.310\nThe most important thing is that\nApple can revoke a certificate.\n\n420\n00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.084\nSo the moment Apple hears about\nan app being compromised,\n\n421\n00:20:13.084 --> 00:20:15.980\nthey can yank that certificate and\nit stops it from working.\n\n422\n00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.080\nThere used to be a third option down\nhere that said anywhere, right?\n\n423\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.580\nAnd that was removed in El Capitan.\n\n424\n00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.557\nSo that one was removed in the last\nversion, and they basically just said,\n\n425\n00:20:26.557 --> 00:20:27.760\nwe don't ever wanna do that.\n\n426\n00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.910\nYou're going to have Gatekeeper\nno matter what for those, and\n\n427\n00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:31.990\nyou'll have to approve them\non an app by app basis.\n\n428\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.218\nThat way, if you get a virus,\nthere will be a pop-up like,\n\n429\n00:20:34.218 --> 00:20:35.390\ndo you want to open this virus?\n\n430\n00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.952\n[LAUGH] And you can say, I don't know what\nthat application is, and cancel out of it.\n\n431\n00:20:38.952 --> 00:20:41.209\nThat'll save you a lot of effort.\n\n432\n00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.342\nThere is one more type of application\nthat I haven't really mentioned,\n\n433\n00:20:46.342 --> 00:20:49.370\ncuz I don't think of it as an application,\nbut they technically are.\n\n434\n00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:53.620\nAnd they are dashboard widgets right.\n\n435\n00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:59.668\nThe dashboard is, I have a love-hate\nrelationship with dashboards.\n\n436\n00:20:59.668 --> 00:21:04.316\nIf you, when you fire up a new install of\nMac OS Sierra and you do the three finger\n\n437\n00:21:04.316 --> 00:21:10.210\nswipe, or some people obviously do a two\nfinger swipe, you have multiple desktops.\n\n438\n00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.226\nSo you can have all these different\ndesktops where you have different\n\n439\n00:21:13.226 --> 00:21:14.480\napplications that reside.\n\n440\n00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.576\nOr a lot of times I'll do it with virtual\nmachines where I'll fire up a virtual\n\n441\n00:21:18.576 --> 00:21:22.150\nmachine like my lab client here,\nI'll just launch it.\n\n442\n00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.530\nAnd it's running on its own desktop right.\n\n443\n00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.270\nAnd see how I can swipe back and\nforth between these.\n\n444\n00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:32.040\nAnd if I do a three fingers swipe, let's\nsee what it do fingers three fingers,\n\n445\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.630\nI can't remember the motion now.\n\n446\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.774\nOver here when I do\nthe three finger swipe,\n\n447\n00:21:35.774 --> 00:21:38.050\nI can see the different\ndesktops that I have.\n\n448\n00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.166\nWell, on a default install,\n\n449\n00:21:39.166 --> 00:21:42.070\nthere's actually one more desktop\nthat I have turned off cuz I hate it.\n\n450\n00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.500\nAnd that's the dashboard.\n\n451\n00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.020\nThe dashboard, if you wanna turn it on or,\nI keep on calling it the dashboard.\n\n452\n00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.150\nIt's mission control,\nis what it's actually called but\n\n453\n00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.000\nthe dashboard is what you see.\n\n454\n00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.728\nSo if I go in the System Preferences,\n\n455\n00:21:53.728 --> 00:21:57.780\nI can find the mission control\npreference right here.\n\n456\n00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.100\nAnd you can turn it On or Off.\n\n457\n00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.550\nAnd see how it says the dashboard\nright now is Off, so mission controls\n\n458\n00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.040\nthe application, the dashboard is what\nyou see, and I've got that turned Off.\n\n459\n00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.146\nSo, I'm gonna turn it On as a space,\nthat's the default for\n\n460\n00:22:09.146 --> 00:22:11.170\nnew install of MAC OS Sierra.\n\n461\n00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.188\nAnd what you basically have is,\nyou have your main desktop,\n\n462\n00:22:14.188 --> 00:22:17.990\nyou have any other desktop you've\nfull-screen application for, right.\n\n463\n00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.220\nSo maybe I've launched Safari.\n\n464\n00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.440\nAnd I'll full screen Safari right.\n\n465\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.942\nSo now I've got my desktops, Safari and my\nvirtual machine that I can move back and\n\n466\n00:22:26.942 --> 00:22:28.190\nforth between right.\n\n467\n00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.590\nSo each of those are showing up.\n\n468\n00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.800\nBut I've also got this\ndashboard over here now,\n\n469\n00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.370\nthis fourth entry that\nwasn't there a moment ago.\n\n470\n00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:40.130\nAnd if I swipe to the left\nthere's the dashboard and\n\n471\n00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.660\nin mission control's dashboard,\nyou have widgets.\n\n472\n00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.620\nEach widget is technically an application.\n\n473\n00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.150\nThese are programs right?\n\n474\n00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:52.836\nWhen you look at each of these, this is a\ncalendar program, this is a clock program,\n\n475\n00:22:52.836 --> 00:22:54.760\na calculator program, and so on.\n\n476\n00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.730\nThat's not a calendar, it's weather right?\n\n477\n00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.440\nSo it's a weather program.\n\n478\n00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.250\nEach one is an application.\n\n479\n00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.728\nAnd when you hit the little plus sign down\nhere, you'll see where there's other ones\n\n480\n00:23:03.728 --> 00:23:06.760\nthat are built into the operating\nsystem that you can install.\n\n481\n00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.294\nWell these are ones that were developed\nby Apple, that are trustworthy,\n\n482\n00:23:10.294 --> 00:23:12.240\nthat have been through checks and so on.\n\n483\n00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.190\nBut there are websites out there\nthat you can go to where you can\n\n484\n00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:18.350\ndownload custom dashboard widgets and\nload them on here.\n\n485\n00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.230\nNow, I never use the dashboard so\nit's not a problem I worry about,\n\n486\n00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.360\nI think it's kind of pointless but\nsome people really like this.\n\n487\n00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.200\nMaybe you track a few stocks or\n\n488\n00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.310\nyou want the news,\nyou have an RSS feed that you follow.\n\n489\n00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:32.980\nSo you get going on here and\nthen in the morning when you wake up and\n\n490\n00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.120\nyou're ready to use your computer,\nyou sit down.\n\n491\n00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.910\nAnd you just swipe over to the left\nscreen and here's your update.\n\n492\n00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.870\nHere's everything at a glance, right,\nlike the front page of the newspaper right\n\n493\n00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:42.880\nhere, you can pull it\nup whenever you want.\n\n494\n00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.840\nThat's the idea behind this, but\n\n495\n00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.950\nthe reality is that each\nof these are programs.\n\n496\n00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:50.100\nAnd when you go to download\na dashboard widget from a third party\n\n497\n00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:55.070\nit is an application, and it can be\ninfected just like anything else, so\n\n498\n00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:56.770\nwe need to be careful with that.\n\n499\n00:23:56.770 --> 00:24:00.400\nAnd in an ideal world, just stick with\nthe widgets that come from Apple.\n\n500\n00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.720\nThey've all been tested.\n\n501\n00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.587\nBut if you get them from a third party,\njust make sure it's a trusted third party.\n\n502\n00:24:05.587 --> 00:24:09.850\nNow when you install widgets,\nIf you install widgets.\n\n503\n00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.551\nI'm gonna drop to the terminal here,\nreal quick.\n\n504\n00:24:11.551 --> 00:24:13.834\nThey usually end up being\nin one of two places.\n\n505\n00:24:13.834 --> 00:24:18.010\nSo inside of your user directory,\nyou have a library.\n\n506\n00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.900\nAnd inside of your library,\nyou have a folder called Widgets.\n\n507\n00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.800\nOr you may not, I don't have it.\n\n508\n00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.651\nThe first time you\ninstall a widget just for\n\n509\n00:24:25.651 --> 00:24:27.354\nyour user account it would be in there.\n\n510\n00:24:27.354 --> 00:24:31.427\nSo it would be\n/users/yourusername/library/widgets and\n\n511\n00:24:31.427 --> 00:24:34.355\nthen you'd see widget\nfiles right in there.\n\n512\n00:24:34.355 --> 00:24:38.356\nAny third party ones you installed just\nfor you would show up in that folder.\n\n513\n00:24:38.356 --> 00:24:39.870\nSo I don't have that one.\n\n514\n00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.230\nBut I will have the global one.\n\n515\n00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:45.550\nIf I go into /Library/Widgets.\n\n516\n00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.340\nAnd we take a look in there,\n\n517\n00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.630\nthere's the widgets that we're\nseeing in the dashboard.\n\n518\n00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:50.940\nThose are the ones that are global.\n\n519\n00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.940\nThese are installed for\nall users and they end in wdgt.\n\n520\n00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.640\nThey don't end in .app, they end in .wdgt.\n\n521\n00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.307\nSo, these are the widgets that\nare effectively applications.\n\n522\n00:25:04.225 --> 00:25:06.820\nAll right,\none last thing that I wanna point out.\n\n523\n00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.961\nAnd I don't think this will show\nup on the exam, but just so\n\n524\n00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:09.985\nyou know in real life land.\n\n525\n00:25:09.985 --> 00:25:14.256\nWhen we install applications,\nif they're installed from the App Store,\n\n526\n00:25:14.256 --> 00:25:16.240\nthe applications get sandboxed.\n\n527\n00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.349\nI mentioned that, right?\n\n528\n00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:20.713\nWell, one area where that's\nimportant to know is\n\n529\n00:25:20.713 --> 00:25:25.213\nthat it changes the permissions\non the applications themselves.\n\n530\n00:25:25.213 --> 00:25:29.565\nSo when you install an application from a\nthird-party it has one set of permissions\n\n531\n00:25:29.565 --> 00:25:31.628\ncuz it can access way more than normal.\n\n532\n00:25:31.628 --> 00:25:35.920\nBut when you install an application\nfrom the App Store it has much more\n\n533\n00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.440\nrestricted permissions on that.\n\n534\n00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.336\nAnd most users aren't gonna see that, but\nif I go into the applications folder and\n\n535\n00:25:42.336 --> 00:25:43.873\ntake a look at my applications.\n\n536\n00:25:43.873 --> 00:25:48.056\nI can find an application that I installed\nfrom outside, like ForkLift, right?\n\n537\n00:25:48.056 --> 00:25:51.604\nSo ForkLift I installed from the outside,\nit's right here.\n\n538\n00:25:51.604 --> 00:25:58.039\nAnd if I do a, ls -la, fork*,\n[LAUGH] We can find it,\n\n539\n00:25:58.039 --> 00:26:02.413\nand oops, You know what?\n\n540\n00:26:02.413 --> 00:26:04.190\nIt's a directory, so\nit's going inside of it.\n\n541\n00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.018\nLet me just do a full\ndirectory listing here.\n\n542\n00:26:06.018 --> 00:26:10.203\nAnd we can find ForkLift, and here it is.\n\n543\n00:26:10.203 --> 00:26:13.136\nAnd if you look at the permissions,\nlook at the permissions on it.\n\n544\n00:26:13.136 --> 00:26:16.572\nIt's owned by depezet, it's owned by me.\n\n545\n00:26:16.572 --> 00:26:19.140\nAnd the group is set to admin.\n\n546\n00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:23.480\nI'm the one who installed it and\nI was the administrator who authorized it,\n\n547\n00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.380\nprompted for administrative credentials,\nI provided it and they installed.\n\n548\n00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.582\nAll right so there it is, I installed it.\n\n549\n00:26:28.582 --> 00:26:32.732\nBut look at some of the other\napplications that are in here,\n\n550\n00:26:32.732 --> 00:26:36.510\nthings like the Font Book or\nFirefox or whatever.\n\n551\n00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:42.515\nSee how some of them are owned by root and\nwheel and others are owned by me, okay?\n\n552\n00:26:42.515 --> 00:26:45.315\nWhen you look at these,\nthe ones that are owned by a user,\n\n553\n00:26:45.315 --> 00:26:48.415\nthose are generally ones that we've\ninstalled from a website, right?\n\n554\n00:26:48.415 --> 00:26:51.835\nWe went to a website, downloaded them,\nand installed them, right?\n\n555\n00:26:51.835 --> 00:26:53.604\nBut, Jump Desktop.\n\n556\n00:26:53.604 --> 00:26:56.363\nYou guys saw where I had purchased that,\nit's in my App Store.\n\n557\n00:26:56.363 --> 00:27:00.284\nAnd I can see it's owned by root and\nadmin, or root and wheel,\n\n558\n00:27:00.284 --> 00:27:03.990\nnot exactly sure why those\nare owned by a different group.\n\n559\n00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.990\nBut the user's the important part here.\n\n560\n00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:10.510\nThe root,\nbecause the system is controlling them.\n\n561\n00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:15.050\nBy default the regular user can\ninstall apps from the App Store\n\n562\n00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.300\nbecause the system is doing it for them.\n\n563\n00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.354\nBut they can't install apps from a third\nparty they'll be prompted to provide\n\n564\n00:27:20.354 --> 00:27:22.343\nadministrative credentials to do it,\nright, and\n\n565\n00:27:22.343 --> 00:27:23.655\nit is because of this ownership.\n\n566\n00:27:23.655 --> 00:27:25.752\nSo if you're ever poking around\nin your applications and\n\n567\n00:27:25.752 --> 00:27:28.090\nyou notice these different permissions.\n\n568\n00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:31.560\nIt's because of where these things\nare being installed from, and\n\n569\n00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.690\nthey end up with different settings like\nthese based on how they're installed.\n\n570\n00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.081\nHere is FileZilla, right?\n\n571\n00:27:36.081 --> 00:27:39.341\nI downloaded that from\nthe FileZilla project website,\n\n572\n00:27:39.341 --> 00:27:41.690\nit's owned by me the group is staff.\n\n573\n00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.339\nSo now we've seen staff, admin,\nwe owe a couple of different groups.\n\n574\n00:27:44.339 --> 00:27:46.920\nThese programs can assign\npermissions incorrectly sometimes.\n\n575\n00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.970\nSo yeah, that's not supposed to be owned\nby staff, but it is, you can notice none\n\n576\n00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:55.428\nof the other ones are owned by staff, it's\nnot, well, it's just inventory access.\n\n577\n00:27:55.428 --> 00:27:58.570\nYou'll see that I have a lot of\napplications from third-party vendors.\n\n578\n00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:02.510\nBut there's plenty that were pulled\neither part of the default install or\n\n579\n00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.760\nfrom the App Store.\n\n580\n00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.600\nSo the serial was one of the ones\nI showed from the App Store.\n\n581\n00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.330\nSo I can find it right here.\n\n582\n00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:12.060\nAnd you see it's owned by root and\nwheel, okay?\n\n583\n00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:16.303\nSo just be aware that there are different\npermissions from the App Store apps versus\n\n584\n00:28:16.303 --> 00:28:17.222\nthe third party.\n\n585\n00:28:17.222 --> 00:28:20.483\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, that's a lot of great\ninformation when we start taking a look,\n\n586\n00:28:20.483 --> 00:28:23.023\nof course,\nat managing these different applications.\n\n587\n00:28:23.023 --> 00:28:27.483\nRemember in terms of installing, we have,\nof course, the App Store itself, and\n\n588\n00:28:27.483 --> 00:28:31.940\nthe website that is normally going\nto be identified by Apple, as well.\n\n589\n00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.284\nYou do, well no you don't,\nanymore, have a chance to\n\n590\n00:28:35.284 --> 00:28:39.384\nbe able to get an app from\nan unidentified Apple provider, right?\n\n591\n00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:42.409\n&gt;&gt; You can get it, it's just it's gonna\nprompt you and you've got to authorize it.\n\n592\n00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:42.983\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n593\n00:28:42.983 --> 00:28:44.306\n&gt;&gt; And you really shouldn't do it.\n\n594\n00:28:44.306 --> 00:28:45.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so don't do that.\n\n595\n00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:46.471\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n596\n00:28:46.471 --> 00:28:50.610\nthen remember that Gatekeeper is what\nhelps us to make sure that we can take\n\n597\n00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:55.441\nadvantage of the security that's there for\ninstalling apps and managing those too.\n\n598\n00:28:55.441 --> 00:29:01.120\nAs well as, lastly, Don's favorite feature\nin of course Apple, dashboard widgets.\n\n599\n00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.370\nYou can have them all over your\ndesktop just like Don does.\n\n600\n00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.395\n&gt;&gt; I actually just turned it off on\nthe background while you were talking.\n\n601\n00:29:05.395 --> 00:29:06.759\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n602\n00:29:06.759 --> 00:29:08.755\nthere's a lot of fun features there too.\n\n603\n00:29:08.755 --> 00:29:10.498\nBut make sure you do\npay attention to that.\n\n604\n00:29:10.498 --> 00:29:14.355\nWell that's a great place for\nus also end this episode, signing off for\n\n605\n00:29:14.355 --> 00:29:16.682\nITProTV I've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n606\n00:29:16.682 --> 00:29:18.781\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Mission

They show where applications are not just a single standalone file but they require additional files to make them function the way users need to them.  Don demonstrates where to find the preference files that help with settings that will allow the user to customize how the product works with the user.  Also He shows the ability lock the files to prevent modifications and lastly how to use the launch services to choose what opens a file instead of allow the OS to choose for us.",

You're watching ITPRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:14.834\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:19.310\nYou're watching the Apple Certified\nSupport Professional for macOS Sierra.\n\n6\n00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.850\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.510\nToday we're diving into\nthe realm of application data.\n\n8\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.800\nTaking look at that with us,\ndeeply, is gonna be Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.136\nDon, welcome back to the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:29.136 --> 00:00:32.260\n&gt;&gt; Wow, being described as deep is not\nsomething that happens to me a lot, but\n\n11\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.013\n[LAUGH] all right.\n\n12\n00:00:33.013 --> 00:00:36.269\nSo, in this episode we're gonna\nbe diving back into applications.\n\n13\n00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.242\nAnd if you've watched\nthe last few episodes,\n\n14\n00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:41.387\nwe've got a chance to learn a little\nbit about how the applications work.\n\n15\n00:00:41.387 --> 00:00:46.315\nAnd I highlighted, in one episode,\nhow an application is really a bundle of\n\n16\n00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:49.397\nfiles that are all combined together,\nright?\n\n17\n00:00:49.397 --> 00:00:53.427\nBut the application doesn't full\nexist inside of that one file.\n\n18\n00:00:53.427 --> 00:00:54.678\nThere's other settings and\n\n19\n00:00:54.678 --> 00:00:58.283\nsupporting files that it'll create in the\nfile system that we need to be aware of.\n\n20\n00:00:58.283 --> 00:01:01.369\nAnd so in this episode we're gonna take\na look at some of those supporting files\n\n21\n00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:02.745\nthat go along with it, all right?\n\n22\n00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:04.617\nBut before I get too far,\nlet me just recap for\n\n23\n00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:06.593\nanybody who didn't catch\nthe other episodes.\n\n24\n00:01:06.593 --> 00:01:10.532\nWhen we browse into our hard-drives,\nI'll take my laptop here for example,\n\n25\n00:01:10.532 --> 00:01:12.390\nand go in to my Applications folder.\n\n26\n00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.170\nI can find an application like, we'll\nuse ForkLift as our example here in this\n\n27\n00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.760\nepisode, I think that's\nthe one I was using before.\n\n28\n00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.512\nSo, I've got this ForkLift application,\nright, and\n\n29\n00:01:21.512 --> 00:01:23.158\nit just shows up as a single icon.\n\n30\n00:01:23.158 --> 00:01:25.903\nAnd when I installed it,\nall I did was drag this icon and\n\n31\n00:01:25.903 --> 00:01:30.400\ndrop it right here into my applications\nfolder, and then, pow, I had ForkLift.\n\n32\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.360\nGreat, wonderful, that's it,\nright, it's one file.\n\n33\n00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.655\nWell, the application itself is\nactually made up of a number of files.\n\n34\n00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:40.138\nAnd if you right-click, or ctrl-click, or\n\n35\n00:01:40.138 --> 00:01:43.775\nwhatever secret is it you have to do\nto get your [LAUGH] menu to come up.\n\n36\n00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:46.651\nYou'll see we've got Open,\nwhich would launch the application, or\n\n37\n00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:47.682\nShow Package Contents.\n\n38\n00:01:47.682 --> 00:01:52.975\nAnd when you choose Show Package Contents,\nyou actually browse inside of the app.\n\n39\n00:01:52.975 --> 00:01:56.655\nAnd inside of the app you'll\nfind quite a few files\n\n40\n00:01:56.655 --> 00:01:58.335\nthat make up the actual application.\n\n41\n00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:00.440\nHere's the actual application,\nright here, but\n\n42\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.190\nif I browse back and\nlook at some of these other folders.\n\n43\n00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.520\nLike when I go into Resources, for\nexample, here's a lot of the icons and\n\n44\n00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.870\nother resources that\nmake up this application.\n\n45\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.780\nIt's all part of that program, right?\n\n46\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.250\nSo, programs are actually kind of complex.\n\n47\n00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.180\nHowever, once this application file is\nwritten like it is, for the most part,\n\n48\n00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.700\nit's read only.\n\n49\n00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.507\nWe don't tamper with what's inside of it,\na lot of these are digitally signed.\n\n50\n00:02:25.507 --> 00:02:28.475\nSo if you do tamper with it,\nlike if I were to rename this icon file,\n\n51\n00:02:28.475 --> 00:02:29.968\nit would break the application.\n\n52\n00:02:29.968 --> 00:02:34.146\nAnd macOS wouldn't allow it to run because\nthe digital signature would fail at\n\n53\n00:02:34.146 --> 00:02:35.220\nthat point.\n\n54\n00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.970\nSo if the application has to store\nsettings and other information,\n\n55\n00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.640\nit's not allowed to store it here.\n\n56\n00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.430\nIt's gotta store it somewhere else, right?\n\n57\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.713\nAnd what am I talking about here\nwhen I talk about settings?\n\n58\n00:02:45.713 --> 00:02:49.639\nWell, if I launch the ForkLift\napplication, so here I am.\n\n59\n00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.080\nAnd when I installed it,\nit went into the Applications folder.\n\n60\n00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.080\nSo, I might have five other\nusers on this computer,\n\n61\n00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.850\nall five of us could run\nthe ForkLift application.\n\n62\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.870\nBut maybe I wanna change\nthe way that it looks.\n\n63\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.520\nSo, for example,\n\n64\n00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.160\nI might wanna go up here to my\nForkLift menu, and go to Preferences.\n\n65\n00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.810\nEvery application has preferences\nthat it keeps track off, and\n\n66\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.700\nyou can change the way that\ndifferent things work.\n\n67\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.095\nWhether you wanna restore\nWindows on tabs startup,\n\n68\n00:03:14.095 --> 00:03:16.060\nwhat this default starting directory is?\n\n69\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.569\nRight, maybe I want this one to start\nin my desktop instead of in my Home\n\n70\n00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:20.870\nfolder, right?\n\n71\n00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.730\nYou can specify what terminal\napplication you used and so on.\n\n72\n00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.350\nThis is all gonna vary based on\nwhatever application you're using.\n\n73\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.090\nBut the key thing here is\nthat these preferences,\n\n74\n00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.330\nthey have to get stored somewhere.\n\n75\n00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.520\nAnd they are, they're stored in preference\nfiles that are called plist files.\n\n76\n00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.950\nPlist is just short for\na preference list, or\n\n77\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.850\na list of all these settings,\nwhat value we put them at.\n\n78\n00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.080\nNow, there's two different\nlevels of preferences.\n\n79\n00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.930\nThere's global preferences that\napply to everybody on the computer.\n\n80\n00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.820\nAnd then there's user preferences\nthat just apply to that user.\n\n81\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.419\nThe settings that I'm showing you here,\nthese are user preferences,\n\n82\n00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:56.295\nthese just apply to me.\n\n83\n00:03:56.295 --> 00:04:00.703\nIf I change it so that it launches and\ngoes right to my hard drive, well,\n\n84\n00:04:00.703 --> 00:04:02.102\nthat would affect me.\n\n85\n00:04:02.102 --> 00:04:05.465\nAnother user that launches this\napplication would be at the default,\n\n86\n00:04:05.465 --> 00:04:08.894\nwhich I think is your home directory,\nso it would default to wherever.\n\n87\n00:04:08.894 --> 00:04:11.162\nThose settings have to be\nstored separately otherwise,\n\n88\n00:04:11.162 --> 00:04:13.584\nwhen I made a change,\nit would overwrite somebody else's.\n\n89\n00:04:13.584 --> 00:04:16.264\nSo like if Ronnie had a different\npreference on his application,\n\n90\n00:04:16.264 --> 00:04:18.910\nI would be overwriting his if they\nwere stored in the same place.\n\n91\n00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.000\nSo instead, they're stored separate.\n\n92\n00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.150\nAnd where you can find those,\nis in the Library folder.\n\n93\n00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:31.967\nIf I fire up a terminal,\nif I go into /Library/Preferences, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.320\nWhen you browse into /Library/Preferences,\n\n95\n00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.550\nthese are the global preferences for\nyour system.\n\n96\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.800\nAnd if we pull up a listing in here,\nI'll find plist files for\n\n97\n00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.320\nmaybe not every application, but\nfor many applications, right?\n\n98\n00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.851\nSome applications don't have\na global preference, right?\n\n99\n00:04:52.851 --> 00:04:55.325\nAnd so\nI might not find them here in my list, and\n\n100\n00:04:55.325 --> 00:04:58.315\nthat's because they track\neverything on a user basis.\n\n101\n00:04:58.315 --> 00:04:59.710\nIt's actually pretty common.\n\n102\n00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.396\nSo, looking at this list here,\nthere's really not all that much, maybe,\n\n103\n00:05:02.396 --> 00:05:04.860\n50, 50 entries.\n\n104\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.720\nI definitely have over 100 apps,\nso I'm missing quite a bit here.\n\n105\n00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.890\nAnd I was using ForkLift as my example,\nlet's find them in the list.\n\n106\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.864\nWell, notice the names of these files,\nit's kinda weird, com.apple and so on.\n\n107\n00:05:17.864 --> 00:05:21.587\nAccording to the Apple design guidelines,\nif the developers follow the guidelines,\n\n108\n00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:22.866\nwhich they don't have to do.\n\n109\n00:05:22.866 --> 00:05:25.520\nIf I downloaded it from a third party\nsite, they could break the guidelines.\n\n110\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.241\nBut if it's from the app store, or\na developer who's worth their salt,\n\n111\n00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:31.322\nthey're gonna follow the guidelines.\n\n112\n00:05:31.322 --> 00:05:35.700\nAnd what they do for naming their\napplication files is they basically take\n\n113\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.050\ntheir domain name and reverse it.\n\n114\n00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.694\nSo apple.com becomes com.apple, and\n\n115\n00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:44.515\nthen they follow that with\nthe application name, right?\n\n116\n00:05:44.515 --> 00:05:48.384\nSo if I'm looking for ForkLift,\nit's by a company called BinaryNights.\n\n117\n00:05:48.384 --> 00:05:52.901\nAnd so I would look for\ncom.binarynights, or net., or org.,\n\n118\n00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.464\nwhatever it is that their domain is.\n\n119\n00:05:55.464 --> 00:05:57.282\nAnd I would try and find it in here, so\n\n120\n00:05:57.282 --> 00:06:00.173\nthis one should be com.binarynights\nwhich I don't see.\n\n121\n00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:02.535\nI see some of the other ones\nlike com.blackmagic-design,\n\n122\n00:06:02.535 --> 00:06:04.440\nthey make my little video recorder.\n\n123\n00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.190\nThey have some global settings, and\nthat's what it's got right here,\n\n124\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.090\nthe preference panel.plist.\n\n125\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.000\nHere's the global settings,\nthese would effect every user.\n\n126\n00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.750\nAll right, if I don't find\nmy application here though,\n\n127\n00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.920\nthen it must be in my User folder.\n\n128\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.971\nSo if I switch back to my User folder,\nwhich you can just type cd and\n\n129\n00:06:20.971 --> 00:06:22.703\nit'll take you to your User folder.\n\n130\n00:06:22.703 --> 00:06:27.420\nAnd I go into Library and\nPreferences, right, so\n\n131\n00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:33.165\nnow my path is\n/user/username/library/preferences.\n\n132\n00:06:33.165 --> 00:06:36.694\nAnd I take a look in here,\nI'll find a lot more,\n\n133\n00:06:36.694 --> 00:06:40.620\nway more than 50,\nactually way more than 100.\n\n134\n00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.530\nThere's probably 200, or more files in\nhere, that's a lot of files, right?\n\n135\n00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.500\nAlmost every application tracks\npreferences for an individual user.\n\n136\n00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.320\nIf they don't, then they might not\ntrack preferences at all, right?\n\n137\n00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.530\nSome applications are so basic, so\nsimple that there's no customization.\n\n138\n00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.400\nYou'd see that with like mission\ncontrol dashboard widgets.\n\n139\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.250\nThey really don't have a whole heck, well,\nno, even those have preference settings.\n\n140\n00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.170\nSo, there are a few\napplications that are just so\n\n141\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.470\nsimple, they don't have anything,\nbut most applications do.\n\n142\n00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.146\nAnd so\nyou'll find them lodge in here somewhere.\n\n143\n00:07:12.146 --> 00:07:16.999\nSo if I look for ForkLift,\nI could find that com.binarynights,\n\n144\n00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:22.397\nthere it is right there,\ncom.binarynights.forklift-3.plist.\n\n145\n00:07:22.397 --> 00:07:24.220\nAll right, this is ForkLift version three.\n\n146\n00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.550\nSo, there's the application\nthat I just run a minute ago.\n\n147\n00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.420\nAnd when change what I want in\nmy default Home folders to be,\n\n148\n00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.190\nit wrote that to this file.\n\n149\n00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:36.770\nAnd this file exists in my user profile,\nso I have permission to write to it.\n\n150\n00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.230\nA regular user wouldn't have permission\nto write to the global preferences,\n\n151\n00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.870\nyou have to be an administrator for that.\n\n152\n00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.060\nBut a regular user can write\nto their own preferences, and\n\n153\n00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.390\nthis is where they're stored.\n\n154\n00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.809\nNow, the reason I highlight this is\nthat sometimes you might be done with\n\n155\n00:07:49.809 --> 00:07:50.902\nan application.\n\n156\n00:07:50.902 --> 00:07:52.781\nYou say, I don't want that application\nanymore, and you delete it, right?\n\n157\n00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:56.397\nYou can just drag an application\nto the trash, and drop it, and\n\n158\n00:07:56.397 --> 00:07:58.112\nit's uninstalled, right?\n\n159\n00:07:58.112 --> 00:08:02.244\nWell, most applications don't clean\nup after themselves when they leave.\n\n160\n00:08:02.244 --> 00:08:04.770\nAnd so, they may leave behind\ntheir preference file.\n\n161\n00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.760\nProbably don't care,\npreference files are really small,\n\n162\n00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.930\nthey're just text files, right?\n\n163\n00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.420\nWell, technically they're binary files,\nwe'll see that in a minute.\n\n164\n00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.020\nBut they're very small.\n\n165\n00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.630\nBut if I ever reinstall the application\nin the future, it'll see that plist and\n\n166\n00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.200\nit'll already be customized.\n\n167\n00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.390\nSo if you're trying to reset\nan application back to defaults, right?\n\n168\n00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:28.450\nI mentioned how when I launched Forklift\nand I go in it, I can't remember what\n\n169\n00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.640\nthe default preference was here for\nthe starting directory, right.\n\n170\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.580\nSo I picked hard drive here but\nmaybe I'll pick something else.\n\n171\n00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.600\nLet me browse here, I'll have a default\nto my virtual machine folder.\n\n172\n00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.820\nThat's not normally where we\nwould want to default that to but\n\n173\n00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.390\nthat's what I'll pick right.\n\n174\n00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.970\nAnd so now,\nwhen I launch Forklift it's gonna default\n\n175\n00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.810\nto my virtual machines folder.\n\n176\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.150\nWell it should of just updated\nmy plist file to reflect that.\n\n177\n00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.056\nIf I delete the plist file though,\nI'll use RM And\n\n178\n00:08:55.056 --> 00:08:58.820\nI'm gonna delete that plist file.\n\n179\n00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.140\nNow it's gone.\n\n180\n00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.890\nThe next time I launch the application,\n\n181\n00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.280\nit's gonna pretend like it's\nthe first time that it ran.\n\n182\n00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.470\nAnd it's gonna say,\nyou've got no preferences.\n\n183\n00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.890\nLet me go with all the defaults.\n\n184\n00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.600\nThis is like resetting the application\nback to its default configuration.\n\n185\n00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.149\nAnd so if I fire Forklift back up.\n\n186\n00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.160\nIt's prompting me for\nmy registration, right.\n\n187\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.060\nI bought this from a third party site so\nI had a registration key.\n\n188\n00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.890\nI need to put in my registration key that\nwas in the preference, and now it's gone.\n\n189\n00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:28.850\nIf I continue my free trial, I can\nget in here and start using ForkLift.\n\n190\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.320\nAnd once I get in here,\nI can go in to my ForkLift preferences.\n\n191\n00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.710\nAnd it's not defaulting to\nmy virtual machine folder,\n\n192\n00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.330\nnow it's back to defaulting\nto my home folder, right?\n\n193\n00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.650\nLikewise, if I messed up my settings and\nI wanted to get them back again.\n\n194\n00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.400\nWell, I might be able to\ngo to time machine and\n\n195\n00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.280\nrestore my plist file from earlier,\nand put it back, right?\n\n196\n00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.540\nSo for example, if we enter time machine\n\n197\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.470\nand I browse to that folder,\nI'd have to go into my\n\n198\n00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.230\npreferences which, it's gonna complain\nat me here cuz it's a hidden folder.\n\n199\n00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.093\nBut if I were to browse in,\nI could recover those preferences and\n\n200\n00:10:09.093 --> 00:10:09.790\nput them back.\n\n201\n00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.530\nAnd once they're back,\nnow those settings are there.\n\n202\n00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.900\nSo it's kinda nice to know\nwhere those plist files are and\n\n203\n00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.450\nwould be able to see them and\nwork with them and so on.\n\n204\n00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.820\nThe thing about the plist file\nis you can manually edit it.\n\n205\n00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.340\nI can go and\nopen that file up and edit it.\n\n206\n00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.000\nAnd in the past,\n\n207\n00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.040\nwe used to have applications\nthat would ask you to do that.\n\n208\n00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.711\nThere'd be settings that they had\nit integrated into the GUI and\n\n209\n00:10:30.711 --> 00:10:33.190\nshould go right in there to modify them.\n\n210\n00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.060\nNowadays, we don't do it very often.\n\n211\n00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.220\nAnd one of the main reasons we don't\ndo that is they're not just regular\n\n212\n00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.120\ntext files anymore like they used to be.\n\n213\n00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.710\nThey are small files, right?\n\n214\n00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:46.227\nSo when you look at some of these\nfiles like the binary nights,\n\n215\n00:10:46.227 --> 00:10:48.250\none that I'm about to mess with.\n\n216\n00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.270\nThis guy right here that got recreated,\nright so\n\n217\n00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.030\nI deleted it but here it is again.\n\n218\n00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.040\nIt came back, right?\n\n219\n00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.920\nBecause now it says I don't\nknow all the defaults.\n\n220\n00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.690\nYou used to be able to just take those and\n\n221\n00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.480\nthen edit them and\nmess around with them, right?\n\n222\n00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.055\nSo I could do something\nlike use the VI editor and\n\n223\n00:11:03.055 --> 00:11:08.080\n[COUGH]\nthrow in that file name and edit it.\n\n224\n00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.575\nBut now when I added it, look what I get.\n\n225\n00:11:09.575 --> 00:11:11.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of a jumbled mess.\n\n226\n00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.640\nAnd I can sort of read what's\ngoing on in here, right?\n\n227\n00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.409\nI see some actual words.\n\n228\n00:11:17.409 --> 00:11:18.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n229\n00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.435\nmost of it are special characters, right?\n\n230\n00:11:21.435 --> 00:11:24.745\nBecause it's been kind of like pseudo\ncomplied into a binary to make it\n\n231\n00:11:24.745 --> 00:11:29.495\noptimized and run faster and to be\na little more tamper resistant, right?\n\n232\n00:11:29.495 --> 00:11:32.865\nSo if we want to work with one of these\nfiles and really mess around with it and\n\n233\n00:11:32.865 --> 00:11:37.070\nkind of change what's in there,\nwe can't do it.\n\n234\n00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.520\nWell actually we can.\n\n235\n00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.547\nThere's a utility that's included\nwith MacOS called the plutil.\n\n236\n00:11:43.547 --> 00:11:44.180\nAll right.\n\n237\n00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.500\nOr the preference list utility.\n\n238\n00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.660\nAnd what it lets you do is\ndecompile a preference list.\n\n239\n00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.390\nAnd you can turn it back into a regular\ntext file so that you can edit it and\n\n240\n00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.730\nmess around with it or whatever.\n\n241\n00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.970\nAnd then you can compile it back again\nto put it back into the binary format.\n\n242\n00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:09.430\nTo convert one, all you do is you'll do\nplutil and then I'm going to say convert.\n\n243\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.600\nAnd most of the files\nare actually XML files.\n\n244\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.460\nSo I'm going to go ahead and convert\nit to an XML, XML conversion one, so\n\n245\n00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.300\nwe say xml1, and\nthen the file that we want to convert.\n\n246\n00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:22.360\nSo I'm going to take the Binary nights,\nForkLift three file.\n\n247\n00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:29.160\nAnd when I run that,\nit's gonna convert it back into XML.\n\n248\n00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.420\nSo when I opened it a moment ago,\n\n249\n00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.690\nyou guys all saw the jumbled\nmess that was in there, right?\n\n250\n00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.020\nWell I'm gonna open it again and\n\n251\n00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.940\nthis time, now it's a properly\nformatted XML document.\n\n252\n00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.740\nAnd so, when I look in here I can\nsee settings and well some of them,\n\n253\n00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.990\nthis is a certificate.\n\n254\n00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.920\nAnd so certificates always look like this.\n\n255\n00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.030\nThere's nothing you can\nreally do about that.\n\n256\n00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:56.250\nBut as I browse down, I'll find other\nsettings in here that are just straight up\n\n257\n00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.040\nregular settings that\nactually do make sense to me.\n\n258\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.880\nAnd so,\nsomething like the default home folder.\n\n259\n00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.840\nWell, the default home folder\nwas at the default values.\n\n260\n00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.670\nSo it's probably not here.\n\n261\n00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.260\nA lot of times, defaults are left out.\n\n262\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.980\nBut once I change it, I'll see it in here.\n\n263\n00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.370\nAnd you can go in and manually edit it and\nchange what that value was.\n\n264\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.620\nThat's all the preferences are being done,\nis storing them right here in these files.\n\n265\n00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.370\nNow, I've decompiled this one.\n\n266\n00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.380\nI don't wanna leave it that way.\n\n267\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.590\nThe application actually won't\nbe very happy about that.\n\n268\n00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.370\nIt's expecting it to be compiled.\n\n269\n00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.520\nSo if you do manually\nmodify a preference file,\n\n270\n00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.440\nwhen you're done you\nneed to convert it back.\n\n271\n00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:34.010\nAnd so you can use plutil to do that and\nyou can say convert binary one.\n\n272\n00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.493\nSo we did xml one a minute ago and\n\n273\n00:13:35.493 --> 00:13:38.080\nnow we'll do binary one to\nconvert it back to binary.\n\n274\n00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:44.260\nAnd we'll specify that same file and\nit's gonna compile it back.\n\n275\n00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.580\nAnd put it back into the jumbled mess\nformat that it was before, right?\n\n276\n00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.790\nSo, just because they're compiled\ndoesn't mean we can't get into them,\n\n277\n00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.332\nit just means we need to\ndecompile them first.\n\n278\n00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:56.300\nAnd plutil is built into MacOS and\nyou've got it, and\n\n279\n00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.920\nyou can use it to easily open those files\nup and look at the settings in there.\n\n280\n00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.360\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, I've seen articles on\nthe internet where people say,\n\n281\n00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.270\nhere's what you do,\nyou go into the plist and you modify it.\n\n282\n00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.140\n&gt;&gt; Is there any way we can prevent\nusers from really tampering with\n\n283\n00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.020\nsomething like this then?\n\n284\n00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nsometimes the vendors will lock a file.\n\n285\n00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.910\nAnd you can lock a file which\nstops people from changing it,\n\n286\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:14.870\nkind of makes it read only.\n\n287\n00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.300\nStops people from deleting it or\nmessing around with it.\n\n288\n00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.230\nThey don't normally do it because\nthe preference folder is hidden already.\n\n289\n00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.000\nWe don't really have to worry\nabout people getting into it.\n\n290\n00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.620\nThey'd have to really be seeking it out.\n\n291\n00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.550\nBut sometimes they will lock it\njust to be on the safe side.\n\n292\n00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.500\nIf that happens,\nthere are two ways they can lock it.\n\n293\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.350\nWe can lock it via the GUI,\nthat's the easy way, or\n\n294\n00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.060\nwe can block it via the command line.\n\n295\n00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.850\nLet me run you through both here, i've got\nan application sitting here or a fille,\n\n296\n00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.110\nsitting here on my desktop, file dot txt.\n\n297\n00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.430\nAnd if I take that file and\ndo a get info command, I or\n\n298\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.080\ncontrol click on it and choose get info.\n\n299\n00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.440\nWhen you look at the settings in here,\n\n300\n00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.500\nyou'll see there's a locked\noption right here.\n\n301\n00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.110\nNow before I turn it on,\nlook at the icon here for this text file,\n\n302\n00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.410\nit's just a white page with file.txt.\n\n303\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:01.330\nAnd if I click the locked check mark,\nthe icon changes,\n\n304\n00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.390\nsee how now it's got a little\nlock sitting here on it, right?\n\n305\n00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:08.230\nI've locked the file, that file can't\nbe deleted and it can't be modified,\n\n306\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:12.750\nit's now locked In place so\nthat's there and it's gonna be present.\n\n307\n00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.840\nYou may find where appeal this file\nis occasionally locked like that.\n\n308\n00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.730\nIt can be done via the command line\nalso if I were to drop to a terminal and\n\n309\n00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.340\nget in to my desktop.\n\n310\n00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.670\nIf I were doing it from the terminal\nyou do it to the administrator to\n\n311\n00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:25.375\nlock it this way.\n\n312\n00:15:25.375 --> 00:15:28.610\nCuz this a little bit different than\nthe lock that's place in the GUI\n\n313\n00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.100\nthat's more of a user lock\nhere's more of a system lock.\n\n314\n00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:36.570\nSo I can do a pseudo chflags,\nchange flags,\n\n315\n00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:44.420\nnouchg, no user change and\nthen specify the file that I want to log.\n\n316\n00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.030\nAnd it's gonna prompt me for\na credentials, and I'll set that.\n\n317\n00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.112\nSo what we're going here,\nis we're using the change flag mean.\n\n318\n00:15:51.112 --> 00:15:55.247\nAnd you might remember that one from the\nfiles episode where we showed how to hide\n\n319\n00:15:55.247 --> 00:15:58.591\na file, looks like you do chflags\nHidden and chflags no hidden.\n\n320\n00:15:58.591 --> 00:16:04.700\nHere I did chflags nouchg, no user change,\nand I set that flag, okay?\n\n321\n00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.350\nNow once I did that,\nit locked the file, right?\n\n322\n00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.630\nNo, it unlocked the file.\n\n323\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:15.550\nI can see here that little lock is gone,\nbecause this is a toggle, with hidden,\n\n324\n00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:19.010\nyou've got the change flags hidden and\nchange flags no hidden.\n\n325\n00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:25.160\nHere, we have changed flags nouchange and\nnouchange is running.\n\n326\n00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.320\nIt toggles that button\neach time that you run it.\n\n327\n00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.290\nSo I just toggled the lock off and\nnow it's unlocked file.\n\n328\n00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.310\nSo we can see right there that it's open.\n\n329\n00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:36.370\nIf you run it across a plist file that\nyou need to modify and it's locked,\n\n330\n00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:37.500\nyou may need to unlock it first.\n\n331\n00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.620\nSo there's two different ways that we\ncan go about that to make sure that it's\n\n332\n00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.310\nable to be modified.\n\n333\n00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.690\nAll right, the other thing\nI wanna talk about here is,\n\n334\n00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.380\nin addition to a preference file,\n\n335\n00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.020\nthere's one more thing that applications\nwill typically modify when they install.\n\n336\n00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.635\nAnd that's what's called a launch service.\n\n337\n00:16:55.635 --> 00:17:01.375\nA launch service is what defines what\nprogram to use to open a file, right?\n\n338\n00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:02.665\nYou've got the application, but\n\n339\n00:17:02.665 --> 00:17:04.945\nthen you've got the data files\nthe application generates.\n\n340\n00:17:04.945 --> 00:17:07.595\nSo, for example,\nI use a program here called Haroopad.\n\n341\n00:17:07.595 --> 00:17:11.855\nAnd Haroopad is a little Markdown\nutility that lets me write\n\n342\n00:17:11.855 --> 00:17:14.265\nthings like my show notes in Markdown.\n\n343\n00:17:14.265 --> 00:17:15.855\nAnd I use it pretty regularly.\n\n344\n00:17:15.855 --> 00:17:19.140\nI've got a little, the editor right here,\n\n345\n00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.340\nI can write my notes in one format and\nkinda see them in a preview,\n\n346\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.240\nhave a look on the website and\nall that, so it's a good program.\n\n347\n00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.520\nBut when I have Markdown, I also have\nanother program that I used called\n\n348\n00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.420\nSublime Text that can\nedit those files as well.\n\n349\n00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.660\nWell, if I go to my examples folder, I've\ngot some show notes from another episode\n\n350\n00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.288\nsitting right here, and\nwhen I double click on that file,\n\n351\n00:17:40.288 --> 00:17:44.270\nhow does macOS know which\nprogram to open it with, right?\n\n352\n00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.990\nWhen I double click on that,\nit opened it in Sublime Text.\n\n353\n00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.920\nBut I use Haroopad instead.\n\n354\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.160\nWell, the system has to know which\nprograms can open up a file.\n\n355\n00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.750\nAnd it does that through a launch service.\n\n356\n00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.958\nAnd when you install one program,\nlike I installed Haroopad, it installed\n\n357\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:05.060\nthe launch service to say, when you open\nup a Markdown file, open it in Haroopad.\n\n358\n00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.990\nWhen I installed Sublime Text,\nit did a launch service for\n\n359\n00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:12.010\na number of other file extensions\nincluding Markdown and took it over.\n\n360\n00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.860\nSo we might need to get\ninvolved with that,\n\n361\n00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.230\nwe might need to influence that process to\ndictate which application opens our file.\n\n362\n00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:24.320\nNow the launch services themselves,\nyou don't ever really mess with, right?\n\n363\n00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.860\nBut let me just show you where\nthey're stored, just so you know.\n\n364\n00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.870\nBut in real life,\nyou really wouldn't mess with these.\n\n365\n00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.939\nIf I go into /Library/Preferences,\n\n366\n00:18:33.939 --> 00:18:37.638\ninside of the Preferences folder,\n\n367\n00:18:37.638 --> 00:18:42.954\nthere is a com.apple\n.launchservices.plist.\n\n368\n00:18:42.954 --> 00:18:49.620\nSo if we look around here,\nand, do I not have it?\n\n369\n00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.760\nI am not seeing it.\n\n370\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.820\nSo let me, let me just check.\n\n371\n00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:59.185\nIf it's not here, then it will be under my\nown, that's a long schema but it's not it.\n\n372\n00:18:59.185 --> 00:19:03.425\nAll right, so if I go into my own user\nfolder, and I'll go into my library and\n\n373\n00:19:03.425 --> 00:19:05.405\nmy preferences there.\n\n374\n00:19:05.405 --> 00:19:07.535\nApparently I don't have any global ones,\nwhich is possible,\n\n375\n00:19:07.535 --> 00:19:10.015\nthis can be tracked separately per user.\n\n376\n00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:12.330\nAnd I kinda figured I have\nmy global one at least.\n\n377\n00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:16.360\nBut let me look here for, there it is.\n\n378\n00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.330\nSo under my user I've got\ncom.apple.LaunchServices, right there.\n\n379\n00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.890\nAnd that preference file is\nactually keeping track of\n\n380\n00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.070\nwhich programs are able to\nopen up which documents.\n\n381\n00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.900\nNow, I don't normally have to mess with\nthat because we can easily do it from\n\n382\n00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.280\nthe GUI.\n\n383\n00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.020\nIf I wanna open up this Markdown file and\nI wanna open it in Sublime Text, well,\n\n384\n00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:36.610\nthat's the default.\n\n385\n00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.870\nI just double click on it, and\nthere it is in Sublime Text, great.\n\n386\n00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.540\nBut if I wanna open it up in Haroopad and\n\n387\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:47.100\nI just wanna do it one time,\nI can Ctrl + click and choose Open With.\n\n388\n00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.390\nAnd then as a one time thing,\nI can come in here and\n\n389\n00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.200\nchoose one of my other programs,\nlike Haroopad.\n\n390\n00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.100\nAnd then it can open up\nover in Haroopad and\n\n391\n00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.830\nit will pop open in that one, eventually.\n\n392\n00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.570\nIt's probably gonna take its time.\n\n393\n00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.910\nSo maybe I'll open it with Marked instead.\n\n394\n00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.400\nA program that will run a little faster.\n\n395\n00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.850\nAnd so I opened it up, and\nthere it opens up in Marked.\n\n396\n00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.140\nSo easy enough for\nme to do as a one time thing.\n\n397\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.170\nBut if I wanted to open up in\nanother program all the time, right?\n\n398\n00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.770\nMaybe I always wanted\nto open up in Marked.\n\n399\n00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:19.650\nWell, if you take a file and\ndo a get info on it, or Ctrl + click and\n\n400\n00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.030\nchoose get info.\n\n401\n00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.650\nYou'll see right here, it's got Open with.\n\n402\n00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:28.780\nAnd you can change the default program\nthat just this one file opens with.\n\n403\n00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.730\nNow, all my other Markdown stuff\nwill still go to Sublime Text, but\n\n404\n00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.420\nthis one will open with Marked.\n\n405\n00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.190\nAnd you can do that, or\nyou can hit Change All.\n\n406\n00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:40.740\nAnd now all of my Markdown files\nare going to open up with Marked.\n\n407\n00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.680\nAnd so from now on, any time I\nwanna open up one of these things,\n\n408\n00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.115\nI can just double click on it.\n\n409\n00:20:46.115 --> 00:20:48.665\nAnd it opens in Marked,\ninstead of opening in Sublime Text.\n\n410\n00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:52.551\nSo there's never really a need to go and\nmodify the plist file itself, I can show\n\n411\n00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:56.553\nyou right here from the GUI and change who\nthat default application is going to be,\n\n412\n00:20:56.553 --> 00:20:58.410\npretty straight forward on that one.\n\n413\n00:21:00.347 --> 00:21:02.197\nThat pretty much wraps up that.\n\n414\n00:21:02.197 --> 00:21:05.307\nI mean, we do have some other\nfiles you'll find like just,\n\n415\n00:21:05.307 --> 00:21:07.027\nI don't want the episode\nto be ten hours long.\n\n416\n00:21:07.027 --> 00:21:10.087\nBut if you were to browse\ninto your library,\n\n417\n00:21:10.087 --> 00:21:15.057\nlet me go into my library real quick,\nand take a look at the files that you've\n\n418\n00:21:15.057 --> 00:21:18.990\ngot in there, you've got application\nscripts and application support.\n\n419\n00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.500\nYou'll find that some applications put\nfiles in the application support folder.\n\n420\n00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.640\nAnd so, you'll find things in here,\nlike here's ForkLift,\n\n421\n00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.780\nwhere it's storing my favorites,\nright here, inside of application support.\n\n422\n00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:32.800\nSo you may have other files that go along\nwith applications that are stored there.\n\n423\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.400\nThey can start to get spread out.\n\n424\n00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.000\nThe key thing to remember here\nis that applications are not\n\n425\n00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.540\ncompletely self-contained to that one\nlittle icon in your applications folder.\n\n426\n00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.540\nWe do have data that's\nstored in other places and\n\n427\n00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.040\nthat data does influence\nthe application every time it runs.\n\n428\n00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well,\nthank you again for\n\n429\n00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.350\nhelping to understand a little bit\nmore about the application data.\n\n430\n00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:54.010\nWe did take a look at those plists,\nremember, don't modify them directly.\n\n431\n00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:55.840\nGo into the applications themselves and\n\n432\n00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.300\nlook in the preferences,\nmodify them there.\n\n433\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.185\nAlso, if we need to build the log files,\n\n434\n00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:02.700\nDon showed us how to be\nable to do that as well.\n\n435\n00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.960\nAnd then, of course, the launch services\nwhere we can choose what particular\n\n436\n00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.530\napplication that we want to be able\nto open whatever file that we're\n\n437\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.800\nusing at that point too, instead of just\nwhatever the default one that is there.\n\n438\n00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.530\nMake sure you take a look at that\nagain as you go in for the exam.\n\n439\n00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.070\nAll right, well, that's a great place for\nus to sign off as well.\n\n440\n00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.820\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n441\n00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:25.900\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n442\n00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.792\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nApple

part two on application data.\n\n11\n00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.550\nDiving right back into it is gonna be Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n12\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.501\nDon, welcome back to the

data.\n\n15\n00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.430\nIn the last episode, we focused more\non the files that kind of support\n\n16\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.340\nan application and\nhelp an application run.\n\n17\n00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.868\nIn this episode, I wanna focus on\nthe documents that we create, or\n\n18\n00:00:42.868 --> 00:00:47.156\nthe files that we create, inside the\napplication that we actually use, right?\n\n19\n00:00:47.156 --> 00:00:47.972\nLike Microsoft Word.\n\n20\n00:00:47.972 --> 00:00:50.620\nI don't really care about Microsoft Word.\n\n21\n00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.060\nWhat I care about is creating\na document that's in a format that\n\n22\n00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.330\nother people can read.\n\n23\n00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.120\nSo it creates those .DOC documents and\nmost people can open those up.\n\n24\n00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.330\nOr if I use Pixelmator or Adobe Photoshop,\nI can create PNGs and GIF images.\n\n25\n00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.365\nAnd I know those image formats can\nbe opened up wherever they are.\n\n26\n00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:12.076\nSo those files,\nthat's the actual product of our work and\n\n27\n00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:15.698\nthat's what's more important than\nthe program that we used to create them.\n\n28\n00:01:15.698 --> 00:01:18.265\nSo I wanna take a look at those files and\n\n29\n00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:21.490\nhave the operating system supports\nthose and works with them.\n\n30\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.250\nAnd we'll see some interesting things\nas we kinda mess around with it.\n\n31\n00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.200\nWhat I wanna start with is\na feature called Quick Look.\n\n32\n00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.495\nA lot of times, we get to sent documents.\n\n33\n00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:33.740\nWe get to sent files,\nas an email attachment or whatever, and\n\n34\n00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.230\nwe might not necessarily have\nthe application that goes along with it.\n\n35\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.777\nA great example of that are PDFs, right?\n\n36\n00:01:38.777 --> 00:01:41.544\nAdobe portable document format, a PDF,\n\n37\n00:01:41.544 --> 00:01:46.930\nis a file format that's supposed to be\na document that anybody can open, right?\n\n38\n00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.937\nThat is very easily supported.\n\n39\n00:01:48.937 --> 00:01:52.339\nBut if you don't have the Adobe Acrobat\nReader installed or a web browser that\n\n40\n00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:55.800\nsupports displaying it online,\nthen you might not be able to open those.\n\n41\n00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.130\nSo if somebody sends you that document,\nwhat do you have to do?\n\n42\n00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.553\nWell, you gotta go and\ndownload a program to view it.\n\n43\n00:02:01.553 --> 00:02:05.150\nOr if they send you a, well,\nI'll use Pixelmator as an example.\n\n44\n00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.320\nPixelmator is a graphics editor.\n\n45\n00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.200\nIt's a great program.\n\n46\n00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.020\nIt takes forever to load even on the\nfastest of computers, it has to load so\n\n47\n00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.490\nmany extensions and everything that\nit just takes forever to load.\n\n48\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.700\nSo if I just wanna look at\na picture somebody sent me,\n\n49\n00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.050\nI don't wanna open that in Pixelmator,\nit'll take too long, right?\n\n50\n00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.780\nSo instead, I might just wanna\nquickly view the document.\n\n51\n00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.762\nWell, in Mac OS,\nwe have a feature called Quick Look.\n\n52\n00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:29.100\nAnd Quick Look is designed to,\nwell, give you a quick look.\n\n53\n00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.980\nI can look at something fast without\nhaving to go into a full application.\n\n54\n00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.990\nAnd two, it lets me look at files that I\ndon't necessarily have the application\n\n55\n00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.640\navailable for, right?\n\n56\n00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.882\nSo for example here, I'll go into my\nlittle examples folder on my desktop.\n\n57\n00:02:40.882 --> 00:02:44.900\nI've got a PDF in here somewhere,\nit is right here.\n\n58\n00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.031\nSo this is the macOS Support Essentials\n10.12 Exam Preparation Guide right off of\n\n59\n00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:50.400\nApple's website.\n\n60\n00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.020\nSo this is a PDF.\n\n61\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.419\nAnd if I have Adobe Acrobat Reader\ninstalled, I can open it up in there and\n\n62\n00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:56.605\nI can view the document.\n\n63\n00:02:56.605 --> 00:02:58.893\nBut the reality is most web\nbrowsers can open it too.\n\n64\n00:02:58.893 --> 00:03:03.110\nSo I should be able to open it up in\nGoogle Chrome or Safari or whatever, and\n\n65\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.590\nread it that way.\n\n66\n00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.400\nBut if I don't wanna go into one\nof those full-blown programs,\n\n67\n00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.700\nwhat I can do is just hit the space bar.\n\n68\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.040\nIf I hit the space bar,\nit'll open that up in Quick Look.\n\n69\n00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.692\nQuick Look, which some people call Preview\nbut the official title is Quick Look.\n\n70\n00:03:19.692 --> 00:03:24.100\nPeople call it Preview, cuz a lot of times\nyou'll see like Open with Preview up here.\n\n71\n00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.320\nPreview is technically a separate program.\n\n72\n00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.640\nIn Quick Look,\nI'm getting a quick snapshot of that file.\n\n73\n00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.010\nAnd I'm actually seeing the file.\n\n74\n00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.950\nI see each page.\n\n75\n00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.230\nI can navigate through.\n\n76\n00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.330\nAnd likely,\nthis is everything I need, right?\n\n77\n00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.270\nI'm able to look in here and\nget the information that I want.\n\n78\n00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.008\nI can even zoom in a little bit,\ncuz really tiny.\n\n79\n00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:47.648\nSo I can look in here and\nfind the information that I'm looking for\n\n80\n00:03:47.648 --> 00:03:50.790\nall without having to\nlaunch some crazy program.\n\n81\n00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.372\nAnd because it's part of the operating\nsystem, it was very fast.\n\n82\n00:03:53.372 --> 00:03:56.710\nI pressed space bar and I'm viewing it.\n\n83\n00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.390\nEven just launching Acrobat Reader,\nit takes longer than that, better yet\n\n84\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.440\nopening the document that's inside of it.\n\n85\n00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.360\nAnd you'll see that carries\nover to other files.\n\n86\n00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.680\nSo for example, I've got Don's Term Paper,\n\n87\n00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.440\nthat was a text file we made in\none of the earlier episodes.\n\n88\n00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.640\nIf I just hit the space bar on that,\nthere it is.\n\n89\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.900\nThere's my preview that I can see and\n\n90\n00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.820\ntake a quick look at the contents of\nthat file and read what's inside of it.\n\n91\n00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.230\nNow, Quick Look works thanks to a series\nof extensions that are a part of macOS.\n\n92\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.870\nAnd the operating system actually\nships with a handful of them, but\n\n93\n00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.610\nyou can get third party ones.\n\n94\n00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.830\nWhen you install things\nlike Microsoft Office.\n\n95\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.030\nWell, Microsoft Office will install\nQuick Look extensions for it, so\n\n96\n00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.130\nthat you can look at PowerPoint slides and\nWord documents and so\n\n97\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.610\non and actually view those.\n\n98\n00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.330\nA lot of third parties have started\nadopting these but not everyone.\n\n99\n00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.130\nFor example, I've got Markdown files.\n\n100\n00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.530\nI do all my show notes in Markdown and\n\n101\n00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.550\nI've got three different\nMarkdown programs on here.\n\n102\n00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.350\nIf I choose Open With,\nI've got Sublime Text, Haroopad, Marked,\n\n103\n00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.866\nand I use all three of them.\n\n104\n00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:57.780\nNone of them installed\nthe Quick Look extension.\n\n105\n00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.810\nThey just haven't written it.\n\n106\n00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.130\nSo if I choose my Markdown file and I hit\nthe space bar, I just get this, right?\n\n107\n00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.760\nI get a big version of the icon,\nwhich is useless, and then the file name.\n\n108\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.400\nI don't get a preview of it.\n\n109\n00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.380\nSo you don't have Quick Look support for\nevery file format.\n\n110\n00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.312\nBut for the big ones, right?\n\n111\n00:05:14.312 --> 00:05:16.971\nThe PDFs, PNG, JPG, GIF, all those guys.\n\n112\n00:05:16.971 --> 00:05:20.710\nYou're gonna have support for those.\n\n113\n00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.473\nA lot of them are baked in.\n\n114\n00:05:21.473 --> 00:05:24.223\nNow, if you wanna get an idea\nof what I'll support and\n\n115\n00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:27.586\nyou can take a look at where\nthe Quick Look extensions are stored,\n\n116\n00:05:27.586 --> 00:05:31.220\nif you drop to your terminal,\nthere's a few different places.\n\n117\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.540\nYou could have Quick Look\nextensions just for your user.\n\n118\n00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.593\nWe normally don't but you might.\n\n119\n00:05:34.593 --> 00:05:37.740\nIf you do,\nthey'll be in your own library folder.\n\n120\n00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.431\nSo I'm inside of my library.\n\n121\n00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:45.786\nSo /Users/dpezet/Library and you may have\na folder in there called Quick Look.\n\n122\n00:05:45.786 --> 00:05:46.540\nI don't.\n\n123\n00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.400\nThat means, I don't have any third-party\nextensions that have been added just for\n\n124\n00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.280\nmy account.\n\n125\n00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.680\nBut I probably have them for the system.\n\n126\n00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.820\nSo if I go to /Library, right?\n\n127\n00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.322\nThe global library,\nnot the one that's talking about user.\n\n128\n00:05:58.322 --> 00:06:03.280\nIf I go into /Library/QuickLook,\nthere we go.\n\n129\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.072\nSo now I'm in the QuickLook folder.\n\n130\n00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.430\nAnd if I take a look, I can see.\n\n131\n00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.328\nI've got iBooks and iWork.\n\n132\n00:06:07.328 --> 00:06:11.394\nAll right, well, iWork will actually let\nme preview most Microsoft Office documents\n\n133\n00:06:11.394 --> 00:06:13.297\nas well as the ones from the iWork suite.\n\n134\n00:06:13.297 --> 00:06:16.050\nAnd iBooks will let me take\na look at a lot of EPUB and\n\n135\n00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.300\nother type of documents that\nwe generate as part of iBooks.\n\n136\n00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.410\nBut that's it.\n\n137\n00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.225\nI opened a PDF a minute ago.\n\n138\n00:06:23.225 --> 00:06:25.190\nWhere's the PDF extension?\n\n139\n00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.970\nWell, I don't have one.\n\n140\n00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.726\nWell, actually I do.\n\n141\n00:06:27.726 --> 00:06:30.420\nThere's a couple of more that are built\ninto the system that come with\n\n142\n00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.540\nthe operating system.\n\n143\n00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.520\nNow to view the operating\nsystem was a little bit tricky,\n\n144\n00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.090\nbecause the operating system was\nactually stored in the system folder.\n\n145\n00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.600\nAnd if you go take a look in\nthe system folder, you'll see Library.\n\n146\n00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.870\nAnd if you go into the Library folder,\nso I'm in /System/Library and\n\n147\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.990\nI take a look in there,\nyou should find QuickLook.\n\n148\n00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.440\nAnd I don't think it's hidden.\n\n149\n00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.260\nYeah, there it is.\n\n150\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.411\nSo I'm gonna get into QuickLook.\n\n151\n00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:53.690\nAnd so I'm in /System/Library/QuickLook.\n\n152\n00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.820\nAnd if we take a look in there,\nnow we're talking.\n\n153\n00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.970\nHere's an actual Office\ngenerator that was installed.\n\n154\n00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:06.990\nWe've got a PDF generator, SceneKit,\nSecurity, Standardbundles, Text, Web.\n\n155\n00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.120\nHere's iBooks, again, iCal.\n\n156\n00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.653\nA lot of these other ones\nthat have been installed for\n\n157\n00:07:11.653 --> 00:07:14.716\ndifferent types of documents\nthat we could quickly view them.\n\n158\n00:07:14.716 --> 00:07:16.790\nNow, I know what some of\nyou guys are thinking.\n\n159\n00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.500\nIt's kind of a nice feature but\nwho really cares, right?\n\n160\n00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.806\nIf I've got a PDF Reader,\nwhy don't I just open it in that?\n\n161\n00:07:21.806 --> 00:07:24.140\nIt only takes a few seconds,\nnot a big deal.\n\n162\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.030\nWell, there is a type of attack that\nis pretty common these days where\n\n163\n00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.310\nsomebody will send you a Word document or\nan Excel spreadsheet or a PDF.\n\n164\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.520\nAnd when you launch it in the background,\nthat launches a malicious program and\n\n165\n00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.850\nit infects your machine, right?\n\n166\n00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.600\nWhen you open a document\ninto full-blown application,\n\n167\n00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.450\nall of the functionality is there.\n\n168\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.210\nBut when you open it in Quick Look,\n\n169\n00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.530\nit's a very basic preview\nof the items inside of it.\n\n170\n00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.892\nAnd so things like macros and\nextension programs will not execute.\n\n171\n00:07:52.892 --> 00:07:55.691\nSo it's actually a safer\nway to preview documents if\n\n172\n00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:57.418\npeople are sending them to you.\n\n173\n00:07:57.418 --> 00:08:00.137\nThat is a very dangerous type of attack,\nit's very common and\n\n174\n00:08:00.137 --> 00:08:01.668\nQuick Look helps us to avoid that.\n\n175\n00:08:01.668 --> 00:08:02.624\nSo it's a neat feature.\n\n176\n00:08:02.624 --> 00:08:04.446\nAnd it's not like we have to install and\nconfigure it.\n\n177\n00:08:04.446 --> 00:08:05.608\nIt's part of the OS.\n\n178\n00:08:05.608 --> 00:08:06.328\nIt's there.\n\n179\n00:08:06.328 --> 00:08:08.141\nYou just highlight a file and\nhit spacebar,\n\n180\n00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:11.220\nthen you'll be previewing that\ndocument really, really quick.\n\n181\n00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.360\nAnd it is also tied into our Finder.\n\n182\n00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.330\nSo when I browse to this folder,\nI always keep the detail view turned on.\n\n183\n00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:24.430\nBut if I were to switch to the icon view,\nthese icons a ctually reflect Quick Look.\n\n184\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.890\nIf I zoom in on this one, see that icon?\n\n185\n00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.450\nThat's not a fake icon.\n\n186\n00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:35.650\nThe very first page actually has text\nright here, and that little image, right?\n\n187\n00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:41.330\nAnd I can use these arrows and actually\nread through right here in the icon.\n\n188\n00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.100\nThat's Quick Look doing that.\n\n189\n00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.223\nAnd my little RTF file up here.\n\n190\n00:08:45.223 --> 00:08:46.481\nIt's really hard to see but\n\n191\n00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:49.450\nthat's the actual amount of\ntext that I've got in there.\n\n192\n00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.320\nIf I were to go and edit that file, and\n\n193\n00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.630\nmaybe I were to copy and\npaste that so that it's three times.\n\n194\n00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:01.398\nSo now that I've done that, if you look\nin the back, the icon's already updated.\n\n195\n00:09:01.398 --> 00:09:04.620\nAnd you can see it, that's a actual\npreview of the content inside it.\n\n196\n00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.120\nThat's Quick Look doing it.\n\n197\n00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.990\nThat's why it's able to generate\nthese previews so quickly,\n\n198\n00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.910\nbecause it's already done it for\n\n199\n00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:14.210\nthe icon, and now it just generates it in\na larger scale, so that you can see it.\n\n200\n00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.640\nSo pretty neat functionality\nbuilt right in to the OS.\n\n201\n00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.940\n&gt;&gt; So Don, how do we get\nthose third party extensions?\n\n202\n00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.029\nDo we just go to the website and say,\nQuick Look extensions or what do we do?\n\n203\n00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:25.029\n&gt;&gt; When this first came out,\n\n204\n00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:27.310\nthere were a couple of companies\nthat were releasing them.\n\n205\n00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.170\nHere, you can just\ndownload this extensions.\n\n206\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.220\nBut now,\nmost of the vendors support them, so\n\n207\n00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.170\nwhen you install their product,\nthe extensions come along with it.\n\n208\n00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.950\nThe only time we have to install\nthe extensions by themselves is if you\n\n209\n00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.620\nwanna be able to view the documents but\nnot actually have the program.\n\n210\n00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.760\nMaybe I want to view\nMicrosoft Office stuff, but\n\n211\n00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.450\nI don't wanna actually install\nMicrosoft Office cuz it costs money.\n\n212\n00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.220\nWell then, I'd need the extensions.\n\n213\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.840\nApple actually has those\nQuick Look ones baked in now.\n\n214\n00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.760\nBut you can go to some vendors and\n\n215\n00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.550\nthey'll actually have where you\ncan download just the extension.\n\n216\n00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.270\nAnd it installs,\nit will usually be a PKG file.\n\n217\n00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.340\nAnd then you run it and it installs\nitself inside of your library and\n\n218\n00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.030\nthen off you go.\n\n219\n00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.640\nThere's not too much to that.\n\n220\n00:10:03.672 --> 00:10:04.189\nAll right,\n\n221\n00:10:04.189 --> 00:10:07.762\nwhile we're talking about fancy features\nthat are built in there's another neat\n\n222\n00:10:07.762 --> 00:10:11.244\nfeature that's built in as far as how we\ncan handle the files on the file system.\n\n223\n00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:15.280\nAnd the feature that I want to talk\nabout here is called auto-save.\n\n224\n00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.160\nWhen you work with a document, one problem\nthat a lot of us have had for years and\n\n225\n00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.630\nyears is that you get in,\nyou start working on the document.\n\n226\n00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.690\nYou're writing, you're writing,\nyou're writing, and you forget to save.\n\n227\n00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:28.100\nAnd then maybe the power goes out,\nor you reboot your computer and\n\n228\n00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.210\nthe program closes and you lose your data.\n\n229\n00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:33.880\nAnd that really stinks.\n\n230\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.290\nSo Apple introduced auto-save.\n\n231\n00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.160\nThey actually introduced it back in,\nI believe it started in Mavericks,\n\n232\n00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.370\nseveral versions ago.\n\n233\n00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:45.450\nAnd it made it where applications could\nactually routinely save documents,\n\n234\n00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.160\neven if they were open.\n\n235\n00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.990\nThat if you forget to hit Save,\nthey can save it for you, on your behalf.\n\n236\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.360\nAnd what it actually is,\nis an extension of Time Machine.\n\n237\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.000\nTime Machine runs in the background, and\nit backs up your computer once every hour.\n\n238\n00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.250\nBut it requires you to have some kind of\nexternal media or storage to back up to.\n\n239\n00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.630\nBut there is a mini-Time Machine\nstored right on your hard drive.\n\n240\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.700\nYou might have seen it before.\n\n241\n00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.340\nIf you ever go poking\naround in the terminal, And\n\n242\n00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.680\nyou go into the /Volumes folder.\n\n243\n00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.460\nThat's where any removable\nmedia would show up.\n\n244\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.070\nIf you plug in a USB key or\nsomething it would show up in here.\n\n245\n00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.400\nWell, you'll also see a folder\ncalled MobileBackups.\n\n246\n00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.180\nThat is a miniature version\nof Time Machine that's\n\n247\n00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.170\ntracking the most recent\nchanges to your system.\n\n248\n00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.020\nAnd so\nit could be auto saving my documents and\n\n249\n00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.640\nsaving them into this mobile backup and\nthat gives me two benefits.\n\n250\n00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.580\nBenefit number one, if I'm having\na power outage or something and\n\n251\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.350\nthe computer rebooted,\n\n252\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.720\nwhen it comes back up, it can recover\nthe document right out of that backup.\n\n253\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.655\nI don't even notice it,\nit just happens automatically.\n\n254\n00:11:42.655 --> 00:11:44.070\nIt's pretty awesome.\n\n255\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.910\nThe other thing is,\nI can revert to a previous version\n\n256\n00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.620\neven it I didn't have Time Machine\nrunning, I might have a document,\n\n257\n00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.940\nI delete a paragraph and I hit save and\nI go, shoot, I need that paragraph back.\n\n258\n00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.370\nWell, now I can quickly revert back to\nthat older version of the document, right?\n\n259\n00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.170\nIn order to get this to work,\n\n260\n00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.380\nthere's two settings that we need to\npay attention to in our preferences.\n\n261\n00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.060\nAnd they may not be set the way\nthat you think they should be,\n\n262\n00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.720\nbecause it's really counter-intuitive.\n\n263\n00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.170\nIn order for auto-save to work,\nthere's two things that have to happen.\n\n264\n00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.230\nWe have to have our system\nconfigured to use it and\n\n265\n00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.200\nthe application has to support it.\n\n266\n00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.410\nApple introduced this feature but\n\n267\n00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.040\nit was up to the application\ndevelopers to add support for it.\n\n268\n00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.600\nSo while many applications do support it,\nnot all of them do.\n\n269\n00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.880\nI'll show you how to test.\n\n270\n00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.080\nBut first let's make sure that\nwe have auto save enabled,\n\n271\n00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.970\ncuz I'm pretty sure I've\nturned it off on mine.\n\n272\n00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.210\nSo [LAUGH] I'm gonna go\ninto my System Preferences.\n\n273\n00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.890\nAnd in System Preferences I'm\ngonna go into General.\n\n274\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.050\nAnd inside of General,\n\n275\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.610\nthese are General settings that\napply to the user experience.\n\n276\n00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.315\nAnd it's things like what color\ndo I want my buttons to be.\n\n277\n00:12:47.315 --> 00:12:51.645\nAnd do I wanna have the dark menu bar\nin doc or stick with the light theme.\n\n278\n00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:55.200\nThese are really just aesthetic options.\n\n279\n00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.910\nBut when you scroll down a little\nbit more, we get to two options.\n\n280\n00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.410\nThese guys right here that\nare more than simple aesthetics.\n\n281\n00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:08.230\nAnd when you look at them, notice how they\ndon't mention anything about auto-save.\n\n282\n00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.750\nThe first one says, Ask to keep\nchanges when closing documents.\n\n283\n00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.350\nAnd the second one says,\nClose windows when quitting an app.\n\n284\n00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.110\nThat isn't talking about auto-save at all.\n\n285\n00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.840\nBut these two features actually control\nwhether auto-save works or not.\n\n286\n00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.080\nThis might as well be\nthe auto-save section.\n\n287\n00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.560\nThe first one, ask to keep\nchanges when closing a document.\n\n288\n00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.907\nThat means if I close a document\nthat I haven't saved,\n\n289\n00:13:31.907 --> 00:13:34.845\ndo I want it to ask me to save it or not?\n\n290\n00:13:34.845 --> 00:13:39.238\nIf I check that any time I close\na document it will prompt me to save and\n\n291\n00:13:39.238 --> 00:13:40.790\nI can say no if I wanted.\n\n292\n00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.570\nNo, don't save it, just delete it.\n\n293\n00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.230\nOr yeah, go ahead and save it.\n\n294\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.450\nIf you turn that on,\nit sounds like a good idea, but\n\n295\n00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.750\nthis actually disables auto-save.\n\n296\n00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.430\nWhen that's off,\n\n297\n00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:55.460\nwhen you say don't ask me, what you're\nreally saying is don't ask me, just do it.\n\n298\n00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.320\nJust save it for me.\n\n299\n00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.250\nIt's going to be saving.\n\n300\n00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.390\nIt's gonna auto-save.\n\n301\n00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.241\nSo we generally want that turned\noff if you want auto-save.\n\n302\n00:14:03.241 --> 00:14:06.740\nAnd then the next option is Close\nwindows when quitting an app, right?\n\n303\n00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.490\nWhen I launch an app and\nthat option is turned on, right?\n\n304\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.970\nFor example let's say I fire up textEdit.\n\n305\n00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.585\nOkay, so here's textEdit.\n\n306\n00:14:14.585 --> 00:14:16.080\nLet me minimize that.\n\n307\n00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.950\nAnd I'm gonna choose to\ncreate a new document.\n\n308\n00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.960\nSo this is gonna be Document 1.\n\n309\n00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.380\nAnd then, I'll do another new document.\n\n310\n00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.608\nThis is gonna be document two, right?\n\n311\n00:14:25.608 --> 00:14:27.970\nAnd another new document,\nmust be document three.\n\n312\n00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.620\nMy very very exciting.\n\n313\n00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.180\nNow, when I've got these open,\nif I quit out of textEdit, so\n\n314\n00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.840\nI'm just gonna quit textEdit.\n\n315\n00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.310\nIt's telling me I've got three\ndocuments that haven't been saved and\n\n316\n00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.890\ndo I wanna save them, right?\n\n317\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.030\nAnd I could hit save and\nquit or I can cancel.\n\n318\n00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.480\nWell, either way,\neven if I do save them, right?\n\n319\n00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.180\nSo I can save them, there.\n\n320\n00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.130\nBecause I have auto-save turned on,\nso it can save them.\n\n321\n00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.300\nWhen I launch textEdit again,\nI'm gonna fire up textEdit, and\n\n322\n00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.370\nthere's my three windows.\n\n323\n00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.800\nIt brings them back, right?\n\n324\n00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.450\nBut when it brings them back, that's\ntextEdit actually using part of auto-save,\n\n325\n00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.230\nto say, I need to bring those back.\n\n326\n00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:06.800\nWhen we go back into our preferences and\n\n327\n00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.840\nlook, I had that option set to close\nthe windows when quitting an app.\n\n328\n00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.050\nWhat if I didn't have\nthat set if I uncheck it?\n\n329\n00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:19.440\nWhen I uncheck that,\nI don't wanna close the options there.\n\n330\n00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.031\nWhen I say that,\nnow it's gonna to close the app.\n\n331\n00:15:23.031 --> 00:15:25.420\nAnd those windows\nare technically still open.\n\n332\n00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.370\nThey're not running,\nnot eating memory or anything.\n\n333\n00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.950\nBut when I launch the app the next time\nit'll bring me right back to where I was.\n\n334\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.130\nIt's like resuming where you want to be,\nand\n\n335\n00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.920\nputting you back to where you need to be.\n\n336\n00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:40.200\nSo generally what we want is to have\nboth of these options turned off,\n\n337\n00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.150\nwhich is somewhat counter-intuitive.\n\n338\n00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.560\nI don't want it to ask me to keep changes,\ncuz I know auto-save will do it for me.\n\n339\n00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.590\nAnd I don't want it to close\nwindows when quitting the app,\n\n340\n00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.740\ncuz that way when I reopen the app,\nthe windows will come right back to me.\n\n341\n00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.290\nThat's what I want, right?\n\n342\n00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.550\nThat's auto-save.\n\n343\n00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.821\nSo you might ask yourself, if that's what\nI want, why would I ever turn these on?\n\n344\n00:15:56.821 --> 00:15:59.699\nWell if your application\ndoesn't support auto save,\n\n345\n00:15:59.699 --> 00:16:03.341\nthese are actually pretty useful options,\nand you may want them on.\n\n346\n00:16:03.341 --> 00:16:05.036\nSo you're kind of making a choice here.\n\n347\n00:16:05.036 --> 00:16:08.133\nIf you use applications that support\nauto-save you definitely wanna turn these\n\n348\n00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.645\noff so you get the best functionality.\n\n349\n00:16:09.645 --> 00:16:12.793\nIf you're using applications\nthat don't support auto-save,\n\n350\n00:16:12.793 --> 00:16:16.350\nthen you'll change these to suit your\ndesires, what it is that you want.\n\n351\n00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.710\nAnd usually you'll want to ask to keep\nchanges from closing a document so\n\n352\n00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.540\nyou don't lose your changes, right?\n\n353\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.630\nAll right, so I'm gonna turn those off.\n\n354\n00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:29.080\nAnd then, back here, how do I know\nwhether or not this supports auto-save?\n\n355\n00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.860\nOkay, well, this is textEdit.\n\n356\n00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.970\nIt's by Apple,\nI know it supports auto-save.\n\n357\n00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.790\nBut the way you can check really easily\nif you go into your application, and\n\n358\n00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.420\nyou go up to the File Menu.\n\n359\n00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.430\nLook and see, most of you will\nhave Save and Close, right?\n\n360\n00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:49.500\nBut do you have Duplicate,\nRename, Move To, and Revert To?\n\n361\n00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.740\nThose four options right\nthere are auto-save.\n\n362\n00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.210\nThat's auto-save function.\n\n363\n00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.870\nI can duplicate the file right here from\nthe file menu and create another copy.\n\n364\n00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.740\nI can rename the file\nright here from the menu.\n\n365\n00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.630\nI can move it to another location.\n\n366\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:07.010\nOr I can revert it which means I can\nroll back to a previous version and\n\n367\n00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.440\nthere is no previous version of this one.\n\n368\n00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.295\nLet me pull up something\nthat has a previous version.\n\n369\n00:17:12.295 --> 00:17:13.890\nIs it my term paper?\n\n370\n00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.970\nDon's Term Paper might have\na previous version, let's see.\n\n371\n00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.943\nAnd so if I go to Revert To, shoot.\n\n372\n00:17:19.943 --> 00:17:22.260\nActually it does, yes.\n\n373\n00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.930\nSo if I choose that Revert To,\nthere it goes, and\n\n374\n00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.390\nit's showing me my previous versions.\n\n375\n00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.750\nSee how it's really just\na Time Machine interface.\n\n376\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.970\nAnd I can see where it's only got one\nparagraph versus the three that I have now\n\n377\n00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.060\nfrom the Quick Books stop.\n\n378\n00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.260\nSo that's how I know\nauto-save is supported.\n\n379\n00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:41.420\nThe other thing is, remember when\nI closed this application and\n\n380\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.860\nit asked if I wanted to save and\nI told it to save?\n\n381\n00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.810\nIt never did ask me for\nfile names, did it?\n\n382\n00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.080\nIt didn't actually save them\nanywhere on the hard drive.\n\n383\n00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.920\nIt saved them as part of auto-save.\n\n384\n00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.650\nSo if I take this document here,\nDocument 3 and go to close it,\n\n385\n00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.130\nsee how it's asking me for a file name?\n\n386\n00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.560\nBut it did save it, right?\n\n387\n00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:04.452\nBecause when I quit out of TextEdit, all\nof them went away, those files are gone.\n\n388\n00:18:04.452 --> 00:18:07.400\nAnd then I launch TextEdit again,\nand there they are.\n\n389\n00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.500\nThey have to be saved somewhere.\n\n390\n00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.360\nThat's auto-save, that's it doing it.\n\n391\n00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.900\nSo, it's a great feature to have, and\nit's, just built right in, just have to\n\n392\n00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.990\nget it turned on and configured properly,\nand then it will work.\n\n393\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:19.350\nThat's a nice feature.\n\n394\n00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.710\nThis is what Apple Extra,\n\n395\n00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:24.690\ncall, Resume that you can resume\nworking right where you left off.\n\n396\n00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.170\nEverything pops right back up and\nthere you go.\n\n397\n00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.220\nBetween auto-save and\n\n398\n00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.870\nresuming these two little features\nwe have in our system configuration,\n\n399\n00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.930\nwe can really protect our information,\nbut not every application has it.\n\n400\n00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.119\nFor example, I use Sublime Text for\na lot of my stuff.\n\n401\n00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:44.300\nAnd if I go into the File menu here,\nnotice how I don't have Rename.\n\n402\n00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.670\nI don't have Duplicate.\n\n403\n00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.660\nI don't have Previous Versions.\n\n404\n00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.700\nAll this stuff's missing.\n\n405\n00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.900\nThat's because the author of Sublime Text\nhas not added that functionality yet.\n\n406\n00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.900\nSo be aware that,\n\n407\n00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.180\nand there's actually probably a number of\nprograms that I use that don't have it.\n\n408\n00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.884\nLet me try good old Haroopad here.\n\n409\n00:19:01.884 --> 00:19:03.770\nYeah, Haroopad doesn't have it.\n\n410\n00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.210\nSo if your applications don't have it,\nyou don't get that protection.\n\n411\n00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.990\nBut they might have their\nown built in thing, and\n\n412\n00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.478\nthere's several vendors that do that.\n\n413\n00:19:10.478 --> 00:19:13.680\nSo Sublime Text, it actually\ndoes have its own built in one.\n\n414\n00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:19.356\nSo if I come in here and create a new\ndocument and say this is a new document.\n\n415\n00:19:19.356 --> 00:19:21.280\nAnd then I'm not gonna save it,\nI'm just gonna quit.\n\n416\n00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.140\nSee how it didn't ask me to save or\nanything?\n\n417\n00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.760\nAnd then I can launch Sublime Text and\nit takes me right back to it.\n\n418\n00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.230\nThey've written their own way\nof preserving my documents.\n\n419\n00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.300\nBut it means I'm not\nintegrated with Time Machine.\n\n420\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.120\nI can't quickly revert back to a previous\nversion, I'm missing that functionality.\n\n421\n00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.870\nBut this is a multi platform application,\nso\n\n422\n00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:42.410\nthey support Windows and\nLinux as well as Mac.\n\n423\n00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.900\nAnd so\nthe auto-save feature is only in Mac OS.\n\n424\n00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.390\nIf they supported it, it wouldn't\nwork on the other platforms, so\n\n425\n00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:50.650\nthey wrote their own.\n\n426\n00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:54.740\nBut if you're using an application\nthat's specifically designed for Mac OS,\n\n427\n00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.240\nit'll typically support it and\nyou'll have it.\n\n428\n00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.890\nBut just be aware there's two different\nways that vendors handle this.\n\n429\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.400\nAnd you'd be surprised sometimes,\neven the big shops, like Word,\n\n430\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.710\nI don't think Microsoft supports it,\nlet's find out.\n\n431\n00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.870\nSo if I fire up Microsoft Word and\ncreate a new document here.\n\n432\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.280\nAnd I go up to my File Menu,\nI can see up here, I do have a restore but\n\n433\n00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.820\nsee how it's View Version History Online?\n\n434\n00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.530\nThat's tied into Office365,\nnot tied into auto-save.\n\n435\n00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:24.240\nAnd I don't have the Rename and Duplicate.\n\n436\n00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.964\nFirst, if I fired up Pages, actually\nI don't have Pages installed, do I?\n\n437\n00:20:29.964 --> 00:20:32.600\nBut if I were to fire up one of\nthe native Mac applications they have,\n\n438\n00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.110\ncuz obviously Apple's kind of\nbakes it into their own product.\n\n439\n00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.450\nSo definitely take a look.\n\n440\n00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.793\nYou might not have the support in\nthe applications that you use.\n\n441\n00:20:40.163 --> 00:20:43.070\nAll right, let's see,\nwhat else did I have on my list?\n\n442\n00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.010\nI feel like I'm forgetting something.\n\n443\n00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.790\nBut, running down the list,\nlooks like we've got it.\n\n444\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.060\nDo be aware that sometimes,\n\n445\n00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:55.880\nyou'll be surprised how many\napplications have QuickLook enabled.\n\n446\n00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.000\nBut sometimes, you'll be surprised,\nthere are application that don't have it.\n\n447\n00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.135\nSometimes there can be features inside of\na document that are more complex than what\n\n448\n00:21:02.135 --> 00:21:04.580\nQuickLook can handle and\nit render improperly.\n\n449\n00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.820\nI see this with slide shows all the time.\n\n450\n00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.680\nThat in the preview for the slide show\nit might be missing pie charts or\n\n451\n00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.630\nother components.\n\n452\n00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.360\nBut then when you open\nit up in PowerPoint or\n\n453\n00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.820\none of your presentation applications\nthat everything looks fine.\n\n454\n00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.010\nSo, don't always trust the QuickLook.\n\n455\n00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.290\nIt is designed for\njust a quick glance to look and\n\n456\n00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.340\nsee what's in there, without the risk of\nopening it in a full blown application.\n\n457\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.897\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, well those\nare very interesting features that\n\n458\n00:21:31.897 --> 00:21:34.785\nare automatically there\ninside of the OS by default.\n\n459\n00:21:34.785 --> 00:21:38.340\nRemember to take a look at QuickLook,\nit really is very interesting.\n\n460\n00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:38.940\nDon, believe it or\n\n461\n00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.920\nnot, I've never actually used QuickLook\nin the way that you showed me.\n\n462\n00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.310\nAll these years of using Mac.\n\n463\n00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.981\nAnd it's weird,\nI've always used the preview,\n\n464\n00:21:45.981 --> 00:21:48.343\nthe full-blown preview that they showed.\n\n465\n00:21:48.343 --> 00:21:51.803\nBut I never thought about using QuickLook,\ncuz it wasn't really that important to me\n\n466\n00:21:51.803 --> 00:21:54.580\nwhen I said, previews,\nthat's perfectly fine that'll work.\n\n467\n00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.955\n&gt;&gt; That' super intuitive cuz you don't,\n&gt;&gt; Hit the space bar.\n\n468\n00:21:56.955 --> 00:21:59.285\n&gt;&gt; Right and usually the space bar,\n\n469\n00:21:59.285 --> 00:22:01.995\nI was doing something that\nwould launch the actual finder.\n\n470\n00:22:01.995 --> 00:22:05.125\n&gt;&gt; But overall though remember\nto take a very neat feature,\n\n471\n00:22:05.125 --> 00:22:08.275\nespecially when you start going hey,\nI don't have that program on.\n\n472\n00:22:08.275 --> 00:22:10.289\nTry it.\nSee if it actually does work for you.\n\n473\n00:22:10.289 --> 00:22:13.085\nIt's a feature that users\nwill be interested in.\n\n474\n00:22:13.085 --> 00:22:14.545\nAnd also the auto-save.\n\n475\n00:22:14.545 --> 00:22:17.530\n&gt;&gt; Remember,\nnot as intuitive as it seems try it out,\n\n476\n00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.650\nsee some of the different features there,\nverify that your apps can,\n\n477\n00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.300\neither support it, or not, and then make\nyour decision based on that as well.\n\n478\n00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.155\nBut, that's a great place, also, for\nus to sign off, then, for ITProTV.\n\n479\n00:22:28.155 --> 00:22:29.970\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n480\n00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:30.920\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n481\n00:22:30.920

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.718\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n5\n00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:16.340\nGreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.955\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:22.223\nAnd in today's episode, we are coming back\nat you with more on our ASP, right, ACSP,\n\n8\n00:00:22.223 --> 00:00:23.583\nthat's right, not ASPC.\n\n9\n00:00:23.583 --> 00:00:24.209\n&gt;&gt; ASPCA?\n\n10\n00:00:24.209 --> 00:00:24.944\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, ASCPA, that's right.\n\n11\n00:00:24.944 --> 00:00:26.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; With the eyes of an angel, right,\n\n12\n00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.330\nwe gotta take care of\nour animals out there.\n\n13\n00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.990\nBut, no, this is the ACSP,\nthe Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n14\n00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.711\nAnd joining us in the studio again\nto lend us expertise on the topic,\n\n15\n00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:37.330\nour good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n16\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.520\nDon, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n17\n00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.410\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back Daniel.\n\n18\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.770\nReady to dive right back\ninto application support.\n\n19\n00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.750\nIn the last couple of episodes,\nwe've been talking about installing apps,\n\n20\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.470\nand where apps store their data.\n\n21\n00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.815\nAnd, in this episode, we're gonna\ntalk about the stuff that didn't\n\n22\n00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:51.725\nreally quite fit in to the other episodes.\n\n23\n00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:53.775\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The things that we need to know as\n\n24\n00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:56.515\nsupport professionals to keep\napplications up and running smooth.\n\n25\n00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:59.425\nSo it's kind of a mixed bag of\nthings we're gonna cover and\n\n26\n00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:01.115\nit'll be more than what I\ncan fit in one episode.\n\n27\n00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:03.995\nSo we'll do a two parter or\nthree or four, who knows.\n\n28\n00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:06.655\nWe'll run the whole thing to make\nsure we cover all the little odds and\n\n29\n00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:10.065\nends we need to keep our applications\nup and running, happy and healthy.\n\n30\n00:01:10.065 --> 00:01:12.305\nSo that's what's on our\nagenda right here today.\n\n31\n00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:16.030\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, well when it comes\nto application support, what better,\n\n32\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.830\nwhere to start, right,\nthan good old Java, right?\n\n33\n00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.990\nThe Java.\n[LAUGH] It's everywhere.\n\n34\n00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.360\nIt's very ubiquitous.\n\n35\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.900\nI assume Apple also supports this.\n\n36\n00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.570\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's talk about Java.\n\n37\n00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.870\nSo Java is unfortunately a necessary evil\non most computers that are out there.\n\n38\n00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.650\nIf you guys have watched my shows\nin the past, it doesn't take\n\n39\n00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.690\ntoo many of my episodes for\nyou to hear me despair Java at least once.\n\n40\n00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is going to be like\na fifteen minute flogging, right?\n\n41\n00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.190\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm not a fan of\nthe product for a few reasons.\n\n42\n00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.110\nBut it actually does serve\na very important purpose and\n\n43\n00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.660\nwe actually can credit a lot\nof the rise of Apple and\n\n44\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.950\nthe desktop space to having\nthings like Java available.\n\n45\n00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.730\nSee one of the challenges with\nhaving a different operating system\n\n46\n00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.340\nis getting applications to work, right?\n\n47\n00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.360\nSo if I'm a developer, and\nI wanna write an application,\n\n48\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.330\nI'm gonna look at where\nthe biggest market share is.\n\n49\n00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.100\nAnd who's got the biggest market share?\n\n50\n00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.810\nMicrosoft.\n\n51\n00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.510\nSo I'll write a Windows app first, because\nI know I can make a bunch of money.\n\n52\n00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.160\nAnd I might not write\na Mac app until later.\n\n53\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.660\nI might not write it at all, and\n\n54\n00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.790\nthat's very common to see applications\nthat are only available on Windows.\n\n55\n00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.560\nAnd not available on Mac.\n\n56\n00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.560\nAnd the challenge there is, for\nan application to run natively on Mac OS,\n\n57\n00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.700\nit has to support certain libraries,\nit has to support the architecture.\n\n58\n00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.670\nIt's a different kernel that's\ncontrolling everything under the hood\n\n59\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.000\nthan what you have in Windows,\nso it takes a lot of work.\n\n60\n00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.750\nAnd a lot of developers either don't have\nthe monetary resources, or just don't have\n\n61\n00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.890\nthe desire to put in that work to\ncreate a Mac version of the product.\n\n62\n00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.980\nNow that's not a generalization.\n\n63\n00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.060\nThere's plenty of developers out\nthere that create great products.\n\n64\n00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.730\nAdobe is a great example of that where\nAdobe makes Photoshop for macOS and\n\n65\n00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.480\nPhotoshop for Windows.\n\n66\n00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.520\nAnd they're both great products\nthat work very well on their own.\n\n67\n00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.150\nBut if you're a smaller developer or\n\n68\n00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.030\nyou're developing a line of business\napplication, you might not wanna\n\n69\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.970\ndedicate the resources developing on\nmacOS, so that's where Java fits in.\n\n70\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.990\nWhat happened in a long\ntime twenty years ago now\n\n71\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.360\na company called Sun Microsystems\ncreated the Java development language.\n\n72\n00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.910\nAnd the way it works, is you have\nwhat's called the Java engine and\n\n73\n00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.590\nthe Java Runtime Engine or\nJRE, it runs on your computer.\n\n74\n00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.455\nAnd they wrote a Java runtime\nengine that would run on macOS,\n\n75\n00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:18.030\nthat would run on Windows, that would run\non Linux, that would run on darn, your\n\n76\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.440\nevery mobile phone on the planet that is\nvery, very versatile, there's one engine.\n\n77\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.270\nSo Sun Microsystems,\n\n78\n00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.980\nthey put in the work to make their engine\nrun on all these different platforms.\n\n79\n00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.210\nAnd then all a developer has to do is if\nthey write their application in Java,\n\n80\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.530\nIt can run on the Java Runtime Engine.\n\n81\n00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.270\nSo the developer just\nwrites their app once, and\n\n82\n00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.860\nthen it can run on this engine that\nruns on a number of different platforms.\n\n83\n00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.820\nAnd that brought a lot of applications\nover to macOS that didn't exist there\n\n84\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.950\nbefore, applications that might\njust be a Windows only thing.\n\n85\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.190\nA developer can now write once,\nrun anywhere, that was the slogan of Java.\n\n86\n00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.985\nWell, it sounds great but\nI mentioned I don't like it.\n\n87\n00:04:00.985 --> 00:04:02.310\nAnd one of the main\nreasons I don't like it,\n\n88\n00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.300\nis that,\nafter a long run where it ran really well.\n\n89\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.620\nAnd almost every computer had Java\ninstalled just as a de facto standard,\n\n90\n00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.610\na company called Oracle purchased them.\n\n91\n00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.640\nAnd Oracle has not done a great\njob of maintaining Java,\n\n92\n00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.410\nand keeping it secure, and updated.\n\n93\n00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.570\nAnd so it's a challenge.\n\n94\n00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.040\nThis is an attack vector.\n\n95\n00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.170\nIf somebody wants to write a virus,\nor a Trojan, or\n\n96\n00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.140\nwhatever, they're usually gonna target\nWindows, cuz it's the larger market share.\n\n97\n00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.910\nBut if they can target Java,\nnow they can hit Windows, Mac, Linux,\n\n98\n00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.070\nthey can hit all that other stuff, right?\n\n99\n00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.330\nThey can use that versatility against us.\n\n100\n00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.490\nAnd it happens, it happens a lot.\n\n101\n00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.970\nThere are a lot of Java exploits\nthat are out there in the wild.\n\n102\n00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.800\nSo, we've gotta keep it up to date.\n\n103\n00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.900\nNow, why am I bringing all of\nthis up in a Mac show, and\n\n104\n00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.590\nin a applications support show?\n\n105\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.440\nThe reason is when you're\nout there in the field, and\n\n106\n00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.160\nyou're deploying applications on Macs,\nyou may have some that require Java,\n\n107\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.810\nthat you need to have Java on your system.\n\n108\n00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.240\nI've got some on my laptop right now.\n\n109\n00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.420\nI don't like Java, but\n\n110\n00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.820\nI've got it installed because I have\nto have it to run certain applications.\n\n111\n00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.320\nSo in that scenario you've got\nto install the Java framework.\n\n112\n00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.180\nAnd you've got to get it put on\nthe system and get it up and going.\n\n113\n00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.060\nNow Apple embraced that in the early days.\n\n114\n00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.180\nThey wanted that, because they wanted\nmore applications on the platform.\n\n115\n00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.190\nBut as they've grown,\nthey don't need it anymore.\n\n116\n00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.350\nNow there's plenty of developers\nout there that do say,\n\n117\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.930\nI'm going to create that Mac version.\n\n118\n00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.770\nEven Microsoft,\nwhere you have Microsoft Office for Mac,\n\n119\n00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.710\nwhich used to be like the red headed\nstepchild of all the software.\n\n120\n00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.498\nNow it's practically feature\nparity with the Windows version.\n\n121\n00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:35.090\nIt's really good stable software.\n\n122\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.420\nSo now Apple doesn't need it anymore and\nthey don't really embrace it,\n\n123\n00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.876\nCuz they've kinda left it\nto Oracle to deal with, and\n\n124\n00:05:40.876 --> 00:05:43.728\nthat's kinda the important thing\nthat I wanna mention here.\n\n125\n00:05:43.728 --> 00:05:46.998\nWhen you go out there on the internet and\nyou start reading articles and\n\n126\n00:05:46.998 --> 00:05:49.716\neven from some of the software\ndevelopers that you trust,\n\n127\n00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:53.160\nthey'll give you instructions\non installing their product.\n\n128\n00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.060\nAnd sometimes, they'll recommend going and\n\n129\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.690\ninstalling the Oracle Java Runtime Engine,\nwhich is the right thing to do.\n\n130\n00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.930\nOther times, they'll give you\nthe instructions to go and\n\n131\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.790\nget Apple's version of Java.\n\n132\n00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.910\nNow what am I talking about there?\n\n133\n00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.570\nWell, in the early days,\nApple embraced Java.\n\n134\n00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.250\nBut as it got shown, the Java wasn't\nnecessarily as safe as we all hoped.\n\n135\n00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.380\nApple kind of got in there and started\ntaking a hand in what was going on.\n\n136\n00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.100\nAnd so they released this,\nI'm gonna pull it up here in my laptop.\n\n137\n00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.170\nThis is Apple's version\nof the Java Runtime.\n\n138\n00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.310\nSo Apple said, you know,\nwe're gonna step in,\n\n139\n00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.520\nwe're gonna take the java runtime that\nwas created by Sun and then Oracle.\n\n140\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.290\nAnd we're going to patch it, secure it,\nmake it where you can deploy it\n\n141\n00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.620\nright from us, get it on the system and\nrun it nice and safe.\n\n142\n00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.390\nAnd so for several years, every\ndeveloper flocked to this like crazy,\n\n143\n00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.470\nlike yes, finally we don't\nhave to get it from Oracle,\n\n144\n00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.030\njust over here and get it from Apple,\nthis is what you want, right?\n\n145\n00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.730\nSo you'll find tons of instructions out\nthere in the internet that are telling\n\n146\n00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.540\nyou, go and install this.\n\n147\n00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.350\nAll right, but\nthere's one big problem that you'll see.\n\n148\n00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.070\nMost of you've probably spot it already.\n\n149\n00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:05.110\nFirst off, I don't see the macOS Sierra\nname mentioned anywhere on here.\n\n150\n00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.900\n&gt;&gt; The last one I see there is El Capitan.\n\n151\n00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.350\n&gt;&gt; El Capitan, right?\n\n152\n00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.508\nWhich is the last version, right?\n\n153\n00:07:09.508 --> 00:07:10.160\nWe're on 10.12 now.\n\n154\n00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.494\n&gt;&gt; People still using it.\n\n155\n00:07:11.494 --> 00:07:12.880\n&gt;&gt; It's not ancient.\n\n156\n00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.370\nSo looking at that, you might think to\nyourself, they're still updating this.\n\n157\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.375\nBut look at the date on this thing, right?\n\n158\n00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:24.950\n2015-001.\nThis is the first edition that\n\n159\n00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.675\nwas released in 2015.\n\n160\n00:07:25.675 --> 00:07:27.955\nThis is the latest one.\n\n161\n00:07:27.955 --> 00:07:29.415\nThere was no second edition in 2015.\n\n162\n00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:35.703\nAnd so assuming, let's just assume that\nthis was released on December 31st, 2015.\n\n163\n00:07:35.703 --> 00:07:36.354\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The very last day.\n\n164\n00:07:36.354 --> 00:07:37.745\nIt wasn't, right?\nIt was much earlier in the year.\n\n165\n00:07:37.745 --> 00:07:40.825\nBut assuming it was the very last day,\n\n166\n00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:43.100\nit's not been updated in over a year and\na half.\n\n167\n00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.050\nOkay, Apple has, is that good math?\n\n168\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.313\nYeah, that's good math, right?\n\n169\n00:07:47.313 --> 00:07:47.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n170\n00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.326\n&gt;&gt; Apple has discontinued support for\n\n171\n00:07:49.326 --> 00:07:52.491\nthis, is the short story there,\nright?They're no longer updating this.\n\n172\n00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:56.732\nSo if you deploy it, you still can, right,\nit actually will run on macOS Sierra.\n\n173\n00:07:56.732 --> 00:07:59.003\n&gt;&gt; Is there any good reason to?\n\n174\n00:07:59.003 --> 00:08:01.183\nUsually people do it because\ndevelopers tell them to do it, okay.\n\n175\n00:08:01.183 --> 00:08:02.802\nThere's plenty of reasons not to do it.\n\n176\n00:08:02.802 --> 00:08:05.810\nThe main reason is not to do it\nbecause it's outdated, right.\n\n177\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.490\nIf you look this is the Java 6 Runtime.\n\n178\n00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.830\nWell, if you go to Oracle's site and\ngo to download Java.\n\n179\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.510\nHere's Oracle site, well,\nI guess they don't really tell me.\n\n180\n00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.740\n&gt;&gt; Eight or something?\n\n181\n00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.470\n&gt;&gt; But it is eight.\n\n182\n00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.190\nYeah, they're up to version eight.\n\n183\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.430\nAnd so once we go here,\nit's gonna offer for\n\n184\n00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.275\nme to download Java, or if you've already\ngot it installed, it'll pick that up.\n\n185\n00:08:25.275 --> 00:08:28.920\nBu,t here it's recommending\nthat I install Java version 8.\n\n186\n00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.778\nAll right, and if I look at the release\ndate on this one, April 18th,\n\n187\n00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:33.410\nthat's less than a month ago.\n\n188\n00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.300\nAll right, so from when this episode was\nfilmed, who knows when you're watching it.\n\n189\n00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.420\nSo they're actively updating it.\n\n190\n00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.680\nThere have been huge updates since Java 6.\n\n191\n00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.240\nSo if you go out to\nan application vendors website and\n\n192\n00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.820\nthey tell you to install the apple version\nof Java, they probably mean well, right?\n\n193\n00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.688\nAnd they probably meant\nwell two years ago, right?\n\n194\n00:08:52.688 --> 00:08:57.135\nBut in today's day and age, we need to\nstop using the Apple version of Java,\n\n195\n00:08:57.135 --> 00:08:58.790\nright, it was great while it lasted but\n\n196\n00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.570\nApple's not supporting it anymore,\nyou usually don't need it.\n\n197\n00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.584\nUnless you've got applications that\nspecifically need Java in which case you\n\n198\n00:09:05.584 --> 00:09:08.214\ncan go right to the Oracle website and\ndownload it.\n\n199\n00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.310\nJust go to Java.com.\n\n200\n00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.690\nJ, A, V, A, dot com.\n\n201\n00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:11.370\nIt's free.\n\n202\n00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.610\nYou download it right here.\n\n203\n00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.950\nThe key thing to remember with Java,\nonce it's installed,\n\n204\n00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.670\nyou can kinda forget about it, right,\nand just run your applications.\n\n205\n00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.210\nYou use your applications,\nyou don't use Java.\n\n206\n00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.832\nIt's hidden behind the scenes.\n\n207\n00:09:21.832 --> 00:09:24.460\nBut you've got to keep it up to date.\n\n208\n00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.460\nIf you don't keep it up to date,\nthere are exploits.\n\n209\n00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.330\nThere's drive by installs that\ncan happen on some websites,\n\n210\n00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.500\nthings that can really cause problems.\n\n211\n00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.660\nAnd so, if you don't keep it up to date\nyou are going to be exposing yourself to\n\n212\n00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.718\nthat risk.\n\n213\n00:09:37.718 --> 00:09:41.240\nWe definitely don't want that, but when\nyou downloaded it the install couldn't\n\n214\n00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.870\nhave been easier, right, you just,\nit's a DMG file that comes in.\n\n215\n00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.150\nAnd once you mount that,\nyou install it just like anything else,\n\n216\n00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.540\nand I just clicked on mine but\nI don't know where it went.\n\n217\n00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.570\n&gt;&gt; It disappeared.\n\n218\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.300\n&gt;&gt; I know, I can't keep track of things.\n\n219\n00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.060\nSo here it is.\n\n220\n00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.220\nThis is the DMG.\n\n221\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.000\nLet me just mount that.\n\n222\n00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.850\nAnd when I open it up,\nyou'd just install it.\n\n223\n00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.350\nNow, notice that it's not a drag and\ndrop install.\n\n224\n00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.880\nI can't just drag and\ndrop it into the applications folder.\n\n225\n00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.070\nIt's a PKG file, it's a package.\n\n226\n00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.320\nAnd that's because you're\nnot installing a program,\n\n227\n00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.370\nyou're actually installing a framework.\n\n228\n00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.110\nA couple of episodes ago I talked about\nsome of the different things you find in\n\n229\n00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.830\nthe slash library folder.\n\n230\n00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.050\nAnd inside the slash library\nthere's a folder called framework.\n\n231\n00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.210\nAnd that's where things that extend to\nthe operating system functionality go,\n\n232\n00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.140\nJava is one of those things.\n\n233\n00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.150\nSo when you install Java it goes\ninto that framework folder and\n\n234\n00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.960\nnow it's available for the system running,\nyou're able to run Java applications.\n\n235\n00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.870\nNow once that's done,\nas far as managing Java,\n\n236\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.700\nwell when you go into your application\nfolder and you poke around and look.\n\n237\n00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.740\nYou're not gonna see Java there, right?\n\n238\n00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.560\nActually, do you see the updater?\n\n239\n00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.890\nNo, you don't even see the updater.\n\n240\n00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.900\nSo you don't see any Java\nentries in here at all, right?\n\n241\n00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.170\nAnd the reason is again,\nbecause it's a framework.\n\n242\n00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.354\nIf you go into your System Preferences.\n\n243\n00:10:54.385 --> 00:10:57.725\nIt adds a system preference\nicon right here.\n\n244\n00:10:57.725 --> 00:11:02.420\nAnd unlike normal system preference icons\nthat take you to a preference screen.\n\n245\n00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.995\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This one launches a separate\n\n246\n00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:04.655\ncontrol panel.\n\n247\n00:11:04.655 --> 00:11:08.075\nSo it's telling me here that it's\nlaunching control panel, and here it is.\n\n248\n00:11:08.075 --> 00:11:10.355\nThis is how I interact with Java.\n\n249\n00:11:10.355 --> 00:11:11.965\nWell normally, we run applications.\n\n250\n00:11:11.965 --> 00:11:13.025\nWe interact with the applications.\n\n251\n00:11:13.025 --> 00:11:15.480\nSo this is just how we control\nthe framework, itself.\n\n252\n00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.609\nAnd so we can take a look at it we\ncan find a what version running,\n\n253\n00:11:18.609 --> 00:11:23.111\nfor example I'm running version 1.8, which\nwe saw earlier was was the latest one now.\n\n254\n00:11:23.111 --> 00:11:27.942\nJava's numbering is a little wierd,\nsee it says is a version 8 update 131,\n\n255\n00:11:27.942 --> 00:11:33.061\nit's actually version 1.8, and just leave\nthe one off and name it after the major\n\n256\n00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:37.770\nversion because it was taking them forever\nto advance all the way to 2 point-\n\n257\n00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.480\n&gt;&gt; People were understanding too easily,\n\n258\n00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.342\nthat's the problem.\n\n259\n00:11:40.342 --> 00:11:40.937\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n260\n00:11:40.937 --> 00:11:43.090\nThey just decided they were\nnever gonna get to 2.0 so\n\n261\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.240\nlet's just call it version 8.\n\n262\n00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.490\nSo that's what they did but so\nthat's the version I'm running,\n\n263\n00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.180\nI can check that version really easily.\n\n264\n00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.060\nAnd I can tweak things like\nthe security settings, and\n\n265\n00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.130\nthat's the thing that I wanna highlight\nhere the most is that if you're accessing\n\n266\n00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:01.960\nJava applications, there's risk, because\nthere's numerous exploits available.\n\n267\n00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.640\nSo you wanna make sure that you're\nrunning high-level security or very high.\n\n268\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.230\nIt's unusual, right?\n\n269\n00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.530\nIt's not like other software,\nwhere you have low and medium.\n\n270\n00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.365\nHere you've got High and Very High.\n\n271\n00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:15.520\n[LAUGH] You can't choose\nanything beneath that.\n\n272\n00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.290\nThey know.\n\n273\n00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.600\nThis is an attack target so\nwe've gotta make sure that it's protected.\n\n274\n00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.540\nAnd you can specify exceptions.\n\n275\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.220\nSee these exceptions that I've put in?\n\n276\n00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.170\nThese are for servers and\n\n277\n00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.570\nother things that are right here\non my own network that I trust.\n\n278\n00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.850\nI want to run Java applications\nfrom these servers.\n\n279\n00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.430\nBut if I'm on some random website\nthat I clicked on through Google link\n\n280\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.260\nI don't wanna run Java by default.\n\n281\n00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.670\nI'm not gonna allow that, right.\n\n282\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.190\nAnd you'll see where it\ndoesn't allow that by default.\n\n283\n00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.800\nIf I go, well actually.\n\n284\n00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.400\n&gt;&gt; I don't think it prompts you anymore.\n\n285\n00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.849\n&gt;&gt; Well, I cleared the message too fast,\nlet me exit out of Safari here real quick,\n\n286\n00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:47.192\nand I'll go back into Safari.\n\n287\n00:12:47.192 --> 00:12:50.023\nWhen I first went to the Java.com webpage,\n\n288\n00:12:50.023 --> 00:12:54.535\nit did actually prompt me whether or\nnot I wanted to run a Java applet and\n\n289\n00:12:54.535 --> 00:12:58.920\nwhat it was doing was testing to see\nif I already had Java installed.\n\n290\n00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.724\nI can't remember if I clicked yes or\nno which is really the problem.\n\n291\n00:13:02.724 --> 00:13:04.821\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Problems like that.\n\n292\n00:13:04.821 --> 00:13:09.010\nBut they've got a little link on here\nsomewhere if I could find it for\n\n293\n00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:09.920\ntesting Java.\n\n294\n00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.170\nSo lets just get out of here.\n\n295\n00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.720\nWe'll just find it this way.\n\n296\n00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.740\nHere we go.\nSo we can verify our version of Java and\n\n297\n00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.370\nwhen you do that you'll see the pop up,\nwhich apparently I clicked allow.\n\n298\n00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.761\nSo it'll-\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n299\n00:13:19.761 --> 00:13:20.630\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n300\n00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.320\nYeah.\nSo do\n\n301\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.230\nyou want to run this application, right?\n\n302\n00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:27.420\nIf I'm on some website that I don't\ntrust I don't wanna run the application.\n\n303\n00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.080\nBut if I do trust it I can run it and\n\n304\n00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.980\nI can even say don't show it\nagain from this publisher.\n\n305\n00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.290\nThe publisher is Oracle America.\n\n306\n00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.940\nI will leave that on check for\nnow but I will go ahead and run it.\n\n307\n00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.950\nAnd now it is able to test and\n\n308\n00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.700\nit ran a little Java app test to\nmake sure I had Java, alright.\n\n309\n00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.960\nThe other thing you wanna pay attention\nto is back in that control panel,\n\n310\n00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.840\nthere is a Update tab.\n\n311\n00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.370\nAnd that's where we can see whether\nwe're updated the latest version or\n\n312\n00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.670\nnot and you can set it to check for\nautomatic updates.\n\n313\n00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:55.223\nYou definitely want to check for\nautomated updates.\n\n314\n00:13:55.223 --> 00:13:57.050\nOnce a day it will reach out and check.\n\n315\n00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:00.663\nMine actually checked three minutes ago,\napparently.\n\n316\n00:14:00.663 --> 00:14:04.170\n[LAUGH] So it probably checked\nautomatically when I launched the control\n\n317\n00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.320\npanel, or this is an amazing coincidence.\n\n318\n00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.150\nBut it'll check automatically,\nusually once a day.\n\n319\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.640\nIt'll look for an update and\nif there is one it'll apply it.\n\n320\n00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.030\nYou definitely wanna do that.\n\n321\n00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:16.820\nYou'll find sometimes your developers will\nsay, look, the latest version of Java\n\n322\n00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.620\nmesses with our apps, so you wanna\nturn off automatic updates right now.\n\n323\n00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.180\nDon't do it.\n\n324\n00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.470\nThey need to fix that app, right?\n\n325\n00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.880\nBecause these are almost\nalways security updates.\n\n326\n00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.830\nJava is a high risk target so\nwe gotta be careful with that.\n\n327\n00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.380\nAnd if you're not using Java anymore,\nthen you should uninstall it.\n\n328\n00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.790\nAnd if you re-run that installation\nyou can take that one out and\n\n329\n00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.370\nyou can get it removed.\n\n330\n00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:41.080\nSo if you need it by all means\ninstall it keep it up to date,\n\n331\n00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.640\nif you do not need it uninstall it,\nget it off of there.\n\n332\n00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Java seems to be one of\nthose digital games of tag where\n\n333\n00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.390\nthe hackers are out there going ha ha,\nwe found an exploit.\n\n334\n00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:53.360\nAnd they're going okay, we patched it, and\nthen back and forth and back and forth.\n\n335\n00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.925\nIt's just a never-ending time for them.\n\n336\n00:14:54.925 --> 00:14:55.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n337\n00:14:55.425 --> 00:14:57.555\non one hand it's not Oracle's fault,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n338\n00:14:57.555 --> 00:15:01.047\n&gt;&gt; They've created or San created\nthis really versatile platform so\n\n339\n00:15:01.047 --> 00:15:05.474\nit's attacked just because you know if you\nwrite an application even a malicious one\n\n340\n00:15:05.474 --> 00:15:07.616\nit can run everywhere perfect, right.\n\n341\n00:15:07.616 --> 00:15:11.490\nBut at the same time Oracle hasn't really\ndedicated the security efforts to making\n\n342\n00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.419\nsure that its locked down and\nsecure that it should have, and so\n\n343\n00:15:14.419 --> 00:15:17.210\nthat's why I kind of blame them\ngenerally make fun of Java.\n\n344\n00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:23.230\n&gt;&gt; All right Don moving on next topic as\nyou were, we have iCloud installed right,\n\n345\n00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.680\nit's part of the Apple suite or\nApple as an entity and\n\n346\n00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.250\nit can also be used as\nan application correct?\n\n347\n00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.986\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and I know it sounds like\nthese two things aren't quite really\n\n348\n00:15:31.986 --> 00:15:33.007\nthe Java and iCloud, Ron.\n\n349\n00:15:33.007 --> 00:15:34.226\nLet me try and tie them together.\n\n350\n00:15:34.226 --> 00:15:36.217\nJava is a framework, right and\n\n351\n00:15:36.217 --> 00:15:41.210\nit allows us to run applications on\ntop of it ICloud is a framework also.\n\n352\n00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:42.410\nWe don't normally think of it that way.\n\n353\n00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.280\nWhen we look at iCloud we think it's\nsynchronizing my bookmarks, yay or.\n\n354\n00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.201\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n355\n00:15:46.201 --> 00:15:48.704\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah I can upload my photos,\nI can find my Mac,\n\n356\n00:15:48.704 --> 00:15:50.552\nthat's actually pretty darn useful.\n\n357\n00:15:50.552 --> 00:15:51.244\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that is nice.\n\n358\n00:15:51.244 --> 00:15:54.293\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So there's things like that,\nwe look at the features offered there.\n\n359\n00:15:54.293 --> 00:15:58.302\nBut for a developer, somebody writing\nan application, there are a number\n\n360\n00:15:58.302 --> 00:16:02.550\nof features in iCloud that they can\nhook into and connect and use, right?\n\n361\n00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.531\nA great example of that is storage.\n\n362\n00:16:04.531 --> 00:16:07.760\nWhen you set up iCloud like here,\nI'm pretty sure I'm logged in to iCloud.\n\n363\n00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.680\nLet's go back to my system preferences,\nand\n\n364\n00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.910\nI'm gonna go in to my iCloud\nicon as soon as I find it.\n\n365\n00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:13.990\nHere it is.\n\n366\n00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.760\nAnd inside of iCloud,\n\n367\n00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.860\nif you're signed in, you'll see all\nthe different services that are available.\n\n368\n00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.030\nSo looking at mine, I've got iCloud drive,\nphotos, mail, contacts,\n\n369\n00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.070\ncalendars and so on.\n\n370\n00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.610\nMost of the stuff like if I had mail,\ncontacts and calendars turned on,\n\n371\n00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.370\nthat means I can fire\nup the Apple mail app.\n\n372\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.511\nAnd, or Mac OS mail app, and\nit's already set up for my email, and\n\n373\n00:16:33.511 --> 00:16:34.650\nit's got my calendar.\n\n374\n00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.800\nIf I fire up the calendar,\nand contacts, and so on.\n\n375\n00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.970\nThat's already set up.\n\n376\n00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.350\nSafari, it's synchronizing my bookmarks.\n\n377\n00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.975\nVery exciting.\n\n378\n00:16:40.975 --> 00:16:42.524\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notes, whatever,\n\n379\n00:16:42.524 --> 00:16:43.940\nthat's what most of this stuff is doing.\n\n380\n00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.764\nBut we've kind of seen\nthem in earlier episodes.\n\n381\n00:16:45.764 --> 00:16:47.947\nBut the iCloud Drive is a neat one,\n\n382\n00:16:47.947 --> 00:16:51.121\nbecause application vendors\ncan hook into that.\n\n383\n00:16:51.121 --> 00:16:53.861\nAnd they can say, hey,\nI wanna store your data there.\n\n384\n00:16:53.861 --> 00:16:57.061\nIn that way, one,\nyou've got a reliable backup of your data.\n\n385\n00:16:57.061 --> 00:16:59.684\nYour data is automatically\nbeing backed up to the Cloud.\n\n386\n00:16:59.684 --> 00:17:04.400\nAnd two, if you have more than one Mac,\nyou can go and sit down at any of them.\n\n387\n00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.150\nAnd when you're logged into iCloud,\n\n388\n00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.710\nall of your documents\nare waiting right there for you.\n\n389\n00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:09.521\nRight, we see that in the finder.\n\n390\n00:17:09.521 --> 00:17:13.731\nIf I launch my finder, over here on\nthe left side in the navigation tree,\n\n391\n00:17:13.731 --> 00:17:15.355\nI've got my iCloud drive.\n\n392\n00:17:15.355 --> 00:17:18.667\nAnd so if I click on that,\nI'll see like a Pixelmator, right?\n\n393\n00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:21.085\nPixelmator is a little graphics\neditor that I use, and\n\n394\n00:17:21.085 --> 00:17:23.420\nits created a folder right here.\n\n395\n00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.929\nAnd so if I'm editing something in\nPixelmator, I can save it right into my\n\n396\n00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:30.680\niCloud drive, and then I can go to another\ncomputer and I can have access to it.\n\n397\n00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:36.560\nNow, what I'm seeing here, are the storage\nfolders that they're basically open,\n\n398\n00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.670\nthat are public,\nthat are free for me to access.\n\n399\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.000\nI shouldn't say public, it's for\nme, right, not the world.\n\n400\n00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.600\nThere is another storage folder\ninside of the iCloud drive,\n\n401\n00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.440\nthat's called the apps folder.\n\n402\n00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.400\nAnd it is jailed, it's walled off.\n\n403\n00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.620\nSo I can't see it.\n\n404\n00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.740\nWhen you look in your\nstorage you don't see that.\n\n405\n00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.500\nSo for example, I have a iPad and\nI have iCloud backups configured for it.\n\n406\n00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.073\nSo it is backing up to iCloud,\nmy entire iPad.\n\n407\n00:18:03.073 --> 00:18:06.855\nAnd it takes, I don't know like\n20 gigs of space I think for\n\n408\n00:18:06.855 --> 00:18:09.000\nit to backup all of this data.\n\n409\n00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.010\nSo it's about 20 gigs in size,\nI don't see it here, where is it?\n\n410\n00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:15.610\nWell the backup folder is hidden from me,\nthis is protected storage.\n\n411\n00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.010\nApple can actually secure\noff parts of the storage.\n\n412\n00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:23.040\nNow when a application vendor wants to use\niCloud for their storage, they can choose\n\n413\n00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.740\nto put it there and know that it's\nsecure and it can't be tampered with.\n\n414\n00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.900\nIt can only be accessed\nthrough their application,\n\n415\n00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.890\nit gives them an extra level of security.\n\n416\n00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.890\nSo there are several applications\nout there that use it.\n\n417\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.790\nSome of them use it publicly,\nlike Pixelmator is doing right here.\n\n418\n00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.644\nOther's use it privately,\nwhere you don't see it.\n\n419\n00:18:38.644 --> 00:18:39.412\nFor example,\n\n420\n00:18:39.412 --> 00:18:43.513\na lot of video games are starting to put\ntheir saved games in iCloud storage.\n\n421\n00:18:43.513 --> 00:18:47.435\nMakes sense, if I have to format my\nmachine, I Iose my data, I can still get\n\n422\n00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:49.960\nmy saved game back, it's very important\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n423\n00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.056\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But at the same time they\ndon't want you editing your saved files,\n\n424\n00:18:53.056 --> 00:18:54.850\ncuz that will allow you to cheat.\n\n425\n00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.340\nAnd so they store it here\nwhere it's isolated off.\n\n426\n00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.471\nThe application can access the data,\nbut we can't, right?\n\n427\n00:19:00.471 --> 00:19:04.157\nNow we do need to be aware of that,\nbecause if you go into your iCloud drive,\n\n428\n00:19:04.157 --> 00:19:05.692\nyou only have so much storage.\n\n429\n00:19:05.692 --> 00:19:08.740\nAnd eventually,\nyou can start to eat up your space.\n\n430\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.540\nAnd so you will see different things\nin here that you can come in and\n\n431\n00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.468\nlike remove out.\n\n432\n00:19:12.468 --> 00:19:16.280\nLike, Jump Desktop, Jump Desktop is\na remote desktop program that I use.\n\n433\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.210\nAnd it keeps track of all\nthe computers I connect to and\n\n434\n00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.200\nstores them in a history file, and\nthe history file is stored in an iCloud.\n\n435\n00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.273\nWell, when I was back here in my Cloud\ndrive, I don't see Jump Desktop, right.\n\n436\n00:19:26.273 --> 00:19:28.440\nSo it's data is hidden from me.\n\n437\n00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.520\nBut I can always come back over here and\nuncheck this, and\n\n438\n00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.620\nit will remove Jump Desktop's\ndata from the Cloud.\n\n439\n00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.230\nSo I can reclaim the data pretty easy,\nbut I kinda want it to be there, right.\n\n440\n00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.320\nI want that to be there for\nme cuz then I can use it.\n\n441\n00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:44.270\nSo, be aware that there is\nhidden storage that's going on\n\n442\n00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.770\ninside of the iCloud storage,\nnot just what you see, all right.\n\n443\n00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:51.300\nBut be aware that more and\nmore applications are linking into iCloud.\n\n444\n00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.317\nThey're taking advantage of things\nlike the contacts list, and FaceTime,\n\n445\n00:19:55.317 --> 00:19:57.990\nthe key chain for\npassword synchronization.\n\n446\n00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.310\nAnd they're storing a lot of\nthat information in there.\n\n447\n00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:03.316\nIf you really wanna get a good\nview of what you got on iCloud,\n\n448\n00:20:03.316 --> 00:20:06.506\nthese screens here that I'm on,\nthey're decent enough, but\n\n449\n00:20:06.506 --> 00:20:08.994\nyou really need to log\ninto the main iCloud page.\n\n450\n00:20:08.994 --> 00:20:13.092\nWhen you go into your main iCloud account,\nyou'll get a chance to see a lot of that.\n\n451\n00:20:13.092 --> 00:20:17.691\nAnd you can fire up Safari,\nand go to icloud.com.\n\n452\n00:20:17.691 --> 00:20:21.970\nAnd when you go to icloud.com,\nit gives you the web based interface list.\n\n453\n00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.543\nIf somebody were to steal my laptop today.\n\n454\n00:20:24.543 --> 00:20:26.790\nI lost my laptop, that stinks, right?\n\n455\n00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.921\nBut if my documents were synchronized\nto iCloud, I can come right here\n\n456\n00:20:30.921 --> 00:20:35.342\nto the iCloud website, and I can log in\nand I could gain access to that data.\n\n457\n00:20:35.342 --> 00:20:37.302\nNow let me log in real\nquick off camera here, and\n\n458\n00:20:37.302 --> 00:20:39.810\nthen we'll get a chance to take\na look at the iCloud account.\n\n459\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.462\nAll right, so now I'm all logged\nin my super secret password that-\n\n460\n00:20:44.462 --> 00:20:45.080\n&gt;&gt; It's [INAUDIBLE], yeah.\n\n461\n00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.482\n&gt;&gt; I had to look at my password that's\nreally quite really neat the other day.\n\n462\n00:20:48.482 --> 00:20:49.852\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So now I'm logged in.\n\n463\n00:20:49.852 --> 00:20:53.551\nAnd what we see are all the different\napplications that make up a part of\n\n464\n00:20:53.551 --> 00:20:54.560\niCloud.\n\n465\n00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.830\nZoomed in a little crazily, so\nyou might see smaller icons.\n\n466\n00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.752\nBut basically, what you'll see\nis everything laid out here.\n\n467\n00:20:59.752 --> 00:21:03.111\nAnd if you've been synchronizing iCloud,\nyou can access your Contacts,\n\n468\n00:21:03.111 --> 00:21:05.470\nyour Mail, your Calendar,\nand your iCloud drive.\n\n469\n00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.270\nAnd when you browse in your iCloud Drive,\n\n470\n00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.950\nyou can see that same information that I\nwas just looking at in the file system.\n\n471\n00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.836\nThere us Don' Stuff from my document,\ntext edit, where the heck is Pixelmator?\n\n472\n00:21:15.836 --> 00:21:18.887\nWell, Pixelmator is actually being\nhidden in the web interface,\n\n473\n00:21:18.887 --> 00:21:20.640\nthe developers can choose to do that.\n\n474\n00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.182\nThey can choose to hide in certain\naccess environment and not.\n\n475\n00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:27.458\nYou can see we can actually work\nwith add folders, and so on, But\n\n476\n00:21:27.458 --> 00:21:29.350\nhe is still hiding the jailed stuff.\n\n477\n00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:33.065\nI don't see my Jump Desktop,\nor other things, right?\n\n478\n00:21:33.065 --> 00:21:36.060\nThis kind of hidden away in that\nprotective storage on the backend.\n\n479\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.940\nSo, but that's basically it as\nfar as iCloud is concerned.\n\n480\n00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.010\nCouple things about it,\niCloud is free, which is nice.\n\n481\n00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.100\nYou do only get so much storage, though.\n\n482\n00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.710\nI think you only get 5 GB\nof storage by default.\n\n483\n00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:51.320\nAnd, for me, I've eaten up a lot of my\nstorage with mobile device backups,\n\n484\n00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.940\niPhone, iPad, that kind of stuff.\n\n485\n00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:57.690\nSo you can pay $0.99 a month to go to 20\ngigs, and that's usually good enough for\n\n486\n00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:58.450\nbackups.\n\n487\n00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.050\nYou can pay a little\nmore to get more storage.\n\n488\n00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.600\nOther than that, the rest of\nthe iCloud services are all free, and\n\n489\n00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.790\nif nothing else, the Find My Mac or\nFind My iPhone, either one.\n\n490\n00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.570\nReally incredibly useful functionality\nthere, especially for free.\n\n491\n00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.270\nSynchronizing your photos, you can\nshare your photo libraries from here,\n\n492\n00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.130\nwhich is nice.\n\n493\n00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.950\nA lot of photo applications\nhave integrated in the iCloud.\n\n494\n00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.650\nSo if you're supporting Macs out there\nin the real world and you're deploying\n\n495\n00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.490\napplications, you need to look up and find\nout whether they require iCloud support.\n\n496\n00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.190\nCuz if they do, that's two problems\nyou're gonna have to deal with, right.\n\n497\n00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.890\nOne is making sure the application\nhas internet access.\n\n498\n00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.970\nAnd two, making sure that your\nusers have iCloud accounts.\n\n499\n00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:37.220\nAnd there's a whole different\nway of setting that up for\n\n500\n00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.630\nschools and businesses, for\ngetting corporate-managed iCloud accounts.\n\n501\n00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.480\nBecause if people are using\ntheir own iCloud accounts,\n\n502\n00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.670\nyou can't support them, right.\n\n503\n00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.250\nYou can't really help them,\nthey're their own accounts.\n\n504\n00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.520\nAnd if they leave the company,\n\n505\n00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.140\nyou just lost access to all that data and\nyou don't want that.\n\n506\n00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.650\nSo those are all kind of support\nissues that you've got to be aware of\n\n507\n00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:55.830\nwith iCloud.\n\n508\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.440\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don, I know we've\ngot actually a bit more to go.\n\n509\n00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.639\nBut I'm looking at our clock,\n\n510\n00:22:59.639 --> 00:23:03.965\nour time is not being our friend at this\npoint, we've got very little of it left.\n\n511\n00:23:03.965 --> 00:23:06.705\nSo this is a good stopping spot for\nus and we can pick it up with a part two,\n\n512\n00:23:06.705 --> 00:23:07.415\nwhat do you say about that?\n\n513\n00:23:07.415 --> 00:23:08.655\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, sounds like a plan.\n\n514\n00:23:08.655 --> 00:23:10.995\n&gt;&gt; All right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nwe do thank you for joining us today but\n\n515\n00:23:10.995 --> 00:23:12.785\ndefinitely come back for our part two.\n\n516\n00:23:12.785 --> 00:23:15.995\nLearn more about these application\nsupport inside of Mac Sierra,\n\n517\n00:23:15.995 --> 00:23:17.475\nvery cool stuff so far.\n\n518\n00:23:17.475 --> 00:23:19.265\nBut as for this episode,\nwe're gonna call it a day.\n\n519\n00:23:19.265 --> 00:23:22.055\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n520\n00:23:22.055 --> 00:23:22.915\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n521\n00:23:22.915 --> 00:23:24.059\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n522\n00:23:24.059 --> 00:23:30.129\n[MUSIC]\n\n523\n00:23:30.129 --> 00:23:32.190\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO TV\n\n",

00:00:08.229\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.774\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:13.623\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:16.760\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.070\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.140\nAnd in today's episode, well,\nwe are continuing all of more\n\n9\n00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.710\nApple Certified Support Professional\nseries, and joining us back for\n\n10\n00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.720\na part two on application support,\na good friend, Mr Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.065\nDon, welcome back, sir,\nglad to have you again.\n\n12\n00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:30.122\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:34.973\nIn the last episode, we started our\nadventure, talking about things that\n\n14\n00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:37.261\nare just an odd grab bag of things-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:38.736\n&gt;&gt; To support applications, right?\n\n16\n00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:41.470\nWhere we talked a little\nbit about Java and iCloud.\n\n17\n00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.340\nIn this episode, we're gonna talk about\nsome of the other features that are found\n\n18\n00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.590\nin macOS that, we don't\nnecessarily use by themselves, but\n\n19\n00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.770\nwe use in conjunction with\nthe applications that we support.\n\n20\n00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.660\nOne important one that I wanna start with,\nthere are really\n\n21\n00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.600\nit's gonna be a theme that we're\ngonna see through this whole episode,\n\n22\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.940\nwe're gonna be talking about voice stuff,\nright?\n\n23\n00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.143\nVoice is a big buzzword right now, you've\ngot Amazon's Echo and Apple's Siri and\n\n24\n00:01:01.143 --> 00:01:03.074\nGoogle's, whatever it's called.\n\n25\n00:01:03.074 --> 00:01:06.787\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Everybody in the assister has released\n\n26\n00:01:06.787 --> 00:01:09.940\na voice AI assistant in\nthe last few months.\n\n27\n00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.129\nApple really kind of led\nthe charge on that with Siri.\n\n28\n00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:17.598\nSo they've got kind of bigger foot\nin the door of voice assistance\n\n29\n00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:19.320\nthan anybody else.\n\n30\n00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.290\nBut really,\nvoice assistance is not a new technology.\n\n31\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.320\nIt's been around a long, long time.\n\n32\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.411\nI remember installing Dragon Dictate\nthe first time back in 1997 or\n\n33\n00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:30.532\nsomething like that, forever ago.\n\n34\n00:01:30.532 --> 00:01:34.438\nBut there was a soundblaster parrot\nprogram where you could type text and\n\n35\n00:01:34.438 --> 00:01:36.300\nit would read it out to you.\n\n36\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.615\nI had that in probably 1991.\n\n37\n00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:40.773\nSo these are technologies that have\nbeen around a long, long time.\n\n38\n00:01:40.773 --> 00:01:44.005\nAnd they've just evolved and\nbecome incredibly better, and\n\n39\n00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:48.560\nnow are actually useful compare to\nthe junk we do within 10, 15 years ago.\n\n40\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.047\nSo inside of macOS,\nthere's actually three different\n\n41\n00:01:52.047 --> 00:01:56.063\nspeech subsystems which is getting to be,\nat least one to many.\n\n42\n00:01:56.063 --> 00:01:58.357\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna take a look at them here\n\n43\n00:01:58.357 --> 00:02:01.450\nbecause you may have a need for\neach one, it's on space.\n\n44\n00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.090\nAnd I wanna start off with\na product called voice over.\n\n45\n00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.530\nWhat voice over is,\nis that is built in a macOs and\n\n46\n00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.473\nit's designed to take text that's on\nyou screen, and read it to you, right?\n\n47\n00:02:11.473 --> 00:02:14.024\nNow, that sounds like in\nassistive technology,\n\n48\n00:02:14.024 --> 00:02:16.770\nand then we do have\naccessibility features, right?\n\n49\n00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.720\nIf I go into System Preferences, and\nI go into accessibility, that is\n\n50\n00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.880\nwhere we'll see a lot of stuff that helps\npeople that have impairments, right?\n\n51\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.000\nSo if you have a visual or\n\n52\n00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.720\nauditory impairment, maybe your eyes\naren't as sharp as they used to be.\n\n53\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.440\nThere's various features in\nhere that we can tweak, and\n\n54\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.700\nuse to improve our experience\nwith the system, right?\n\n55\n00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.560\nOne example is Zoom, I use zoom.\n\n56\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.200\nI've been using it in every\nsingle episode, right?\n\n57\n00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.110\nEvery time I wanna show you guys something\nthat is really tiny in my screen,\n\n58\n00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.640\nI'm actually using the zoom accessibility\nfeature, and using this hold control and\n\n59\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.140\ndo a two finger gesture to zoom,\nI'm using that all the time, right?\n\n60\n00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.730\nYou don't necessarily have to have\nan impairment to be able to benefit\n\n61\n00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.840\nfrom a lot of this that's here.\n\n62\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.480\nBut it is really designed to assist people\nthat have an impairment to make them where\n\n63\n00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.930\nthey're able to use the computer, and\nget the same level of enjoyment out of it\n\n64\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.800\nas someone who didn't have\nthat same impairment.\n\n65\n00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.430\nNow, one of the ones that you'll\nsee in here is VoiceOver, and\n\n66\n00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.440\nnotice how VoiceOver's kind\nof separate from speech.\n\n67\n00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.920\nI've got two different entries.\n\n68\n00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.360\nAnd they're both listed under vision.\n\n69\n00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.590\nSo if I have a hard time\nreading text on the screen,\n\n70\n00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.860\nwouldn't it be nice if you could\njust read out to me, right?\n\n71\n00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.206\nSo I didn't actually have to try and\nzoom in on these individual words.\n\n72\n00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:31.267\nNow there are a number of third party\nscreen readers that are available out\n\n73\n00:03:31.267 --> 00:03:33.440\nthere that work really, really well.\n\n74\n00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.920\nBut most of them are in the Windows world.\n\n75\n00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.590\nIn the Mac world, there is a couple\nthat have been imported over, and\n\n76\n00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.950\nthey work all right but\nthey're not the greatest in the world.\n\n77\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.160\nThis one is integrated into macOS, and so\nit's pretty much the best you are gonna\n\n78\n00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.140\nget as far as screen\nreaders inside a macOS.\n\n79\n00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.338\nNow the VoiceOver feature\nis turned off by default.\n\n80\n00:03:52.338 --> 00:03:54.939\nAnd you can turn it on,\nthere's two ways to turn it on.\n\n81\n00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.715\nOne, you can turn it on during the\noriginal install, right, when you first\n\n82\n00:03:58.715 --> 00:04:02.373\ngo to install macOS, you boot off that\nUSB key, and you're on the initial\n\n83\n00:04:02.373 --> 00:04:06.522\ninstall screen, it will start talking to\nyou right there from the install screen.\n\n84\n00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:09.586\nIf you wait long enough, it just starts\ntalking and assumes that you need that and\n\n85\n00:04:09.586 --> 00:04:11.090\nthat's one way to turn it on.\n\n86\n00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.803\nThe other way is just coming here and\nturn it on.\n\n87\n00:04:12.803 --> 00:04:16.507\n&gt;&gt; VoiceOver speaks descriptions\nof items on the screen.\n\n88\n00:04:16.507 --> 00:04:18.250\n&gt;&gt; Is that the voice that actually uses?\n\n89\n00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.027\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is one of the voices.\n\n90\n00:04:20.027 --> 00:04:22.709\nThis one is not pleasant, in my opinion.\n\n91\n00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:25.350\n&gt;&gt; It's better than like the ones\nyou're getting the sounds in.\n\n92\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.404\nNot to disperse you talking but, that\ntype of robotic voice that they give you.\n\n93\n00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:31.645\n&gt;&gt; It is important,\n\n94\n00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:36.940\nif you're gonna use this all the time\nto pick a voice that you find pleasant,\n\n95\n00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.900\nand different people have different-\n&gt;&gt; It's subjective.\n\n96\n00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.500\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n97\n00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.950\nIt is, so some people heard that\nvoice right there, like you, and\n\n98\n00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.770\nhad a really good reaction to it,\nI like that.\n\n99\n00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.292\nI heard it and\nthought of Lurch from the Addams' Family.\n\n100\n00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:52.445\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so-\n\n101\n00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:53.350\n&gt;&gt; There's what Lurch reading\n\n102\n00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.070\nthings to it, right?\n\n103\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.267\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n104\n00:04:55.267 --> 00:04:57.356\nyou do have to kinda pick what you want.\n\n105\n00:04:57.356 --> 00:05:02.035\nNow, voiceOver, when you turn it on,\nit's gonna offer well, to turn it off.\n\n106\n00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.302\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:04.415\n&gt;&gt; In case I did it by accident.\n\n108\n00:05:04.415 --> 00:05:06.284\nOr, you can choose to use it.\n\n109\n00:05:06.284 --> 00:05:08.320\nHey, I want to use VoiceOver.\n\n110\n00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.240\nAnd once it's turned on,\nthen you're actually able to get in there.\n\n111\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.540\nAnd it'll start reading\neverything on the screen.\n\n112\n00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.300\nNow, I'm not gonna turn it on,\nwell actually, I guess I will here.\n\n113\n00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.822\nI'm gonna go ahead and turn it on.\n\n114\n00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:20.172\nNow, when I turn it on.\n\n115\n00:05:20.172 --> 00:05:21.811\n&gt;&gt; System preference and accessibility.\n\n116\n00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:22.591\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n117\n00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:23.309\n&gt;&gt; This is what happens.\n\n118\n00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:24.331\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me turn it off.\n\n119\n00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:25.651\nSo, it starts talking, and\n\n120\n00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:29.210\nit was talking a little bit fast\nthere cuz it's not completely set up.\n\n121\n00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.550\nBut it will start reading out everything,\nand\n\n122\n00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.700\nhere on the show that will get\nkind of annoying really fast.\n\n123\n00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.940\nBut, think about when it\nwouldn't be annoying.\n\n124\n00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.770\nLike if that was the only way you were\nable to interface with this system,\n\n125\n00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.800\nthen that's a God send.\n\n126\n00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.210\nIt's not annoying, and here's the chance\nthat I can get all of this read out to me,\n\n127\n00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.700\nI could see what's going on.\n\n128\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.310\nI can virtually see what's going on,\nand interact with this.\n\n129\n00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.198\nNow, there are two pieces of voice\nover that you want to manipulate if\n\n130\n00:05:52.198 --> 00:05:53.617\nyou're going to use it.\n\n131\n00:05:53.617 --> 00:05:56.209\nYou've got VoiceOver Training, and\n\n132\n00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:59.941\nwith VoiceOver Training,\nI'm just gonna mute that.\n\n133\n00:05:59.941 --> 00:06:01.241\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n134\n00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:02.205\n&gt;&gt; You completely defeat the purposes\n\n135\n00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:02.820\nthis wonderful tool.\n\n136\n00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.046\nBut with VoiceOver quick start,\nit runs you to the training,\n\n137\n00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:09.690\nyou're not training VoiceOver,\nVoiceOver is training you.\n\n138\n00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.740\nIt's teaching you how to use it.\n\n139\n00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.920\nAnd so, it's telling you some of the\ndifferent keyboard shortcuts that you can\n\n140\n00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.670\nuse, and some of the different ways that\nyou can make use of the VoiceOver tool.\n\n141\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.820\nSo if you have any employees,\nfamily members, or\n\n142\n00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.730\njust people that you work with\nthat would benefit from this,\n\n143\n00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.960\nit's a good idea to have them go through\nthe training, that they can learn it.\n\n144\n00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.730\nIf you know it, that's good, right?\n\n145\n00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.730\nYou can show somebody how to use it, but\n\n146\n00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.160\nthey really need to be the ones\nto learn how to use it.\n\n147\n00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.070\nSo getting them into this\ntraining is really important.\n\n148\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.030\nIt's 22 pages, it takes a little while,\nthey can run through it,\n\n149\n00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.590\nyou can run through it more than once.\n\n150\n00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.343\nAnd it walks you through.\n\n151\n00:06:43.343 --> 00:06:46.332\nNow, as you go through it,\nit even tells you things like,\n\n152\n00:06:46.332 --> 00:06:49.020\nhow you can speed up the voice or\nslow down the voice.\n\n153\n00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.670\nYou can start to customize it a bit to\nget things set the way that you want it.\n\n154\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.360\nAnd, a lot of these\nscreens are interactive.\n\n155\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.510\nYou'll see here where it's got options\nthat I can come in and tweak, and\n\n156\n00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.860\nchange the way we manipulate it,\nand work with it.\n\n157\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.095\nThese are really just samples, to let you\ntest and learn how to interact with it so.\n\n158\n00:07:06.095 --> 00:07:09.470\nLike here we're saying, Type your name,\nType a sample password.\n\n159\n00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.170\nIt's not wanting your real password.\n\n160\n00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.100\nIt's just giving you a chance to learn,\nwhat it would be like when you get\n\n161\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.450\na password field up, and you type\nsomething in, and you work with it, right?\n\n162\n00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.928\nSo that's what all this is\nabout on the training side.\n\n163\n00:07:19.928 --> 00:07:22.650\n&gt;&gt; I actually using this for\nreading long articles.\n\n164\n00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.430\nInstead of actually having to read it and\nmaybe get distracted.\n\n165\n00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.641\nI can just use the voice over and\nlet it read it to me, speed it up.\n\n166\n00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:31.540\nI get the article a lot faster\nthan I could have read it.\n\n167\n00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n168\n00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.878\n&gt;&gt; And I can listen a whole\nlot faster than I can read.\n\n169\n00:07:33.878 --> 00:07:37.947\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's becoming more and more of a\nchallenge with websites, thanks to ads and\n\n170\n00:07:37.947 --> 00:07:40.130\nall this stuff they inject into them.\n\n171\n00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.870\nBut if you use a service to kind of clean\nthat up in text, it works really well.\n\n172\n00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.994\nYou can get entire news\nbriefings that way.\n\n173\n00:07:45.994 --> 00:07:49.090\nWe're gonna talk about Siri a little bit\nlater and she can do a lot of that too,\n\n174\n00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.244\nand it makes it even easier.\n\n175\n00:07:50.244 --> 00:07:53.011\nThe other thing that we've got in\nhere is the voice over utility.\n\n176\n00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:55.055\nI'm gonna launch the voice over utility,\n\n177\n00:07:55.055 --> 00:07:58.628\nand when we get in here, this is where\nwe can really start to tweak things and\n\n178\n00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:02.354\ncustomize it to meet the needs of\nthe person who's gonna be using it, right?\n\n179\n00:08:02.354 --> 00:08:06.639\nSo here's where we'll see like Whether we\nwant to do modifiers to be able to change\n\n180\n00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:08.578\nthe way that Voice Over's working.\n\n181\n00:08:08.578 --> 00:08:10.740\nYou have to have a keyboard shortcut for\nthat.\n\n182\n00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.570\nYou can set up whether you want it to be\nallowed to be controlled by AppleScript.\n\n183\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.600\nSome applications can make use of that.\n\n184\n00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.700\nBut the other things you can do, is you\ncan tweak things like the verbosity.\n\n185\n00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.750\nVerbosity is important,\nbecause if you have it set\n\n186\n00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.160\nto a high level of verbosity it's gonna\nread every single word that appears.\n\n187\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.379\nAnd that may be overkill for\nwhat you're trying to do.\n\n188\n00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:35.470\nNow if you have a complete impairment of\nyour vision, you need high verbosity.\n\n189\n00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.058\nYou need it to read off everything\nthat's on the screen, but\n\n190\n00:08:38.058 --> 00:08:41.613\nif you're just doing this like Daniel's\nexample of trying to read some articles or\n\n191\n00:08:41.613 --> 00:08:44.730\nwhatever, you'll probably get\nannoyed really fast with high.\n\n192\n00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.110\nAnd you can move it down to medium or\nlow, or you can even customize it further\n\n193\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.420\nto tweak what it is that's getting\nread out at various points.\n\n194\n00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.810\nLike what needs to be called\nout inside and what doesn't.\n\n195\n00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.750\nSo you can kind of\ncustomize a lot of that.\n\n196\n00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.620\nYou can interact with a braille\nkeyboard if you have one.\n\n197\n00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.840\nAnd you can set up other\nthings like different text and\n\n198\n00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.530\npunctuation that gets specified.\n\n199\n00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.030\nAll of that is pretty easy to\ncome in here and customize.\n\n200\n00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.500\nVery, very flexible software.\n\n201\n00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.580\nAnd as you look you'll see customization\noptions for navigation, for\n\n202\n00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.440\nthe web, the sound effects that you use,\n\n203\n00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.870\na lot of other things all\nkind of tucked away in here.\n\n204\n00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.460\nIt's very, very flexible software.\n\n205\n00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.482\nIt's very powerful, and it's designed to\nmake it where macOS is one of the easiest\n\n206\n00:09:22.482 --> 00:09:25.716\nto use for people that need voice\nassistive technology like this.\n\n207\n00:09:25.716 --> 00:09:29.683\nSo that's kind of the key\ncomponents there of Voice Over, but\n\n208\n00:09:29.683 --> 00:09:33.356\nVoice Over isn't the only\nspeech component that we got.\n\n209\n00:09:33.356 --> 00:09:36.356\nI mentioned I wanted to talk about\nfew of the other ones, and so\n\n210\n00:09:36.356 --> 00:09:38.480\nwe'll look at those but before I forget.\n\n211\n00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.650\nLet me just double back\none more spot here.\n\n212\n00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.860\nBack under my accessibility screen,\nI went under Voice Over.\n\n213\n00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.159\nRight beneath it I got speech,\nand if you choose speech,\n\n214\n00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:52.483\nhere's where we see that\ndefault system voice, right?\n\n215\n00:09:52.483 --> 00:09:55.329\nAnd if I play that, let me-\n&gt;&gt; Recognize me by my voice.\n\n216\n00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:56.304\n&gt;&gt; Let me unmute.\n\n217\n00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:59.446\nYou'll hear that voice and\nyou can speed it up and slow it down,\n\n218\n00:09:59.446 --> 00:10:02.075\nand this is what voice over\nis actually leveraging.\n\n219\n00:10:02.075 --> 00:10:04.645\nAnd so here's where we can start\nto tweak and change that, and\n\n220\n00:10:04.645 --> 00:10:08.156\nyou'll see where there's actually a couple\nof different voices you can pick from,\n\n221\n00:10:08.156 --> 00:10:10.397\nboth female and male, so\nyou can kind of find the one.\n\n222\n00:10:10.397 --> 00:10:12.140\n&gt;&gt; Hello, my name is Samantha.\n\n223\n00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.138\nI am an American English voice.\n\n224\n00:10:14.138 --> 00:10:15.218\n&gt;&gt; All right, Samantha.\n\n225\n00:10:15.218 --> 00:10:17.622\nSo we can find the one that we want,\nthat meets our needs.\n\n226\n00:10:17.622 --> 00:10:18.295\nYou can slow it down.\n\n227\n00:10:18.295 --> 00:10:19.223\nYou can kind of have fun with it.\n\n228\n00:10:19.223 --> 00:10:21.299\nIt does change the voices significantly\nwhen you change their speed.\n\n229\n00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:23.703\n&gt;&gt; Hello, my name is Samantha.\n\n230\n00:10:23.703 --> 00:10:24.473\nI am an-\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n231\n00:10:24.473 --> 00:10:27.830\nagain you'll find what you're\ncomfortable with and stick with that.\n\n232\n00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:31.010\nSo that's another option normally\nwhen you configure voice over\n\n233\n00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.650\nyou turn right around the configure speech\nalso and get those both set up together.\n\n234\n00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.701\n&gt;&gt; And Don that is text to speech, right?\n\n235\n00:10:36.701 --> 00:10:41.086\nWe're getting the voice over thing to tell\nus what the text is on the screen, but\n\n236\n00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:42.924\nwhat if we wanna go the other way?\n\n237\n00:10:42.924 --> 00:10:45.537\nWhat if I wanna speak and\nmake a text out of it can we do that?\n\n238\n00:10:45.537 --> 00:10:46.316\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\n\n239\n00:10:46.316 --> 00:10:49.659\nspeak to text is the opposite way\nthe voice recognition side of things.\n\n240\n00:10:49.659 --> 00:10:54.070\nAnd voice dictation has been kind\nof this highly sought after thing.\n\n241\n00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.090\nIf you go back and\n\n242\n00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:58.140\nwatch any episode of Star Trek,\nhow do they interact with the computer?\n\n243\n00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.200\nWell sometimes they touch\non a tablet's surface, but\n\n244\n00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.820\nother times they just talk to it right?\n\n245\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.620\nComputer do this,\nwell that would be really nice and\n\n246\n00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.930\nin the past it just hasn't\nquite been possible.\n\n247\n00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.160\nSo we had a few different subsystems for\nthat.\n\n248\n00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.280\nNow we actually have two.\n\n249\n00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.180\nWe have the original way of\ninteracting with a system.\n\n250\n00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.750\nThe speech and dictation engine\ninside of macOS and we have Siri.\n\n251\n00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.650\nTwo different ways to talk to the system.\n\n252\n00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.850\nWhat Siri does different,\nis she actually blends both.\n\n253\n00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.900\nNot only is she talking to us,\nbut we can talk to her.\n\n254\n00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:32.010\nSo now you have full true interaction,\nso Siri's kind of the future of this.\n\n255\n00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.840\nWhat I just showed you voice over,\n\n256\n00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.860\nthat's the kind of old way\nof getting text to speech.\n\n257\n00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.780\nLet me show you the old way\nof getting speech to text.\n\n258\n00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.220\nBefore you hit that fast forward button,\nand\n\n259\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.000\nyou wonder why it's done\nshowing me the old way.\n\n260\n00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.560\nRemember, if you have somebody who has\nan impairment, like a visual impairment,\n\n261\n00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.250\nand they've learned one way to interact\nwith the system, that is very,\n\n262\n00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.990\nvery important to them.\n\n263\n00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.750\nAnd if you mess with that,\nif you change them to some new system.\n\n264\n00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.470\nThat is a life change.\n\n265\n00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.510\nThat is extremely significant.\n\n266\n00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.900\nSo if they have a way of doing things\nwith the system that they're used to,\n\n267\n00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.460\nthey're efficient with.\n\n268\n00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.690\nThen by all means,\nyou want to support that.\n\n269\n00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.410\nAnd so Apple's not taking away\nthe old system anytime soon.\n\n270\n00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.440\nIt's gonna be around for a long time.\n\n271\n00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.740\nYou may or may not want to use Siri.\n\n272\n00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.820\nIf you go the Siri route, she's still not\nas powerful as some of the old systems.\n\n273\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.438\nThey haven't fully integrated\nher all throughout the OS.\n\n274\n00:12:22.438 --> 00:12:23.822\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say Don, I mean,\n\n275\n00:12:23.822 --> 00:12:28.770\nif Siri not really even meant to be\na accessibility type of feature, right?\n\n276\n00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:33.000\nIt's not specifically, okay you have\nan impairment, Siri is meant to help you.\n\n277\n00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.227\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's what the accessibility\n\n278\n00:12:34.227 --> 00:12:34.991\nportion of this is for.\n\n279\n00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:37.987\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nat some point she will become that, right?\n\n280\n00:12:37.987 --> 00:12:39.148\n&gt;&gt; Right, but she's not there yet.\n\n281\n00:12:39.148 --> 00:12:40.624\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it'll be a little while.\n\n282\n00:12:40.624 --> 00:12:44.971\nWhen she launched, nothing against Apple,\nbut it was really a novelty for\n\n283\n00:12:44.971 --> 00:12:46.558\nthe first couple of years.\n\n284\n00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:49.209\nAnd the most important thing I wanna learn\nabout Siri was how to turn it off, right?\n\n285\n00:12:49.209 --> 00:12:50.949\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And only recently,\n\n286\n00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:54.005\nlike in the last year,\nhas Siri really evolved.\n\n287\n00:12:54.005 --> 00:12:58.253\nAnd I was telling Daniel a funny story\nbefore the show about me cussing at Siri.\n\n288\n00:12:58.253 --> 00:12:59.647\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n289\n00:12:59.647 --> 00:13:00.970\n&gt;&gt; That it's still not perfect.\n\n290\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.400\n&gt;&gt; It still gets your riled up.\n\n291\n00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.760\n&gt;&gt; So we still have some of\nthese other technologies, and\n\n292\n00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.610\nwhat we just saw was the text to speech,\nso let's do the speech to text side.\n\n293\n00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:12.717\nIf I go back to my system preferences,\nand I'm gonna go to keyboard, right?\n\n294\n00:13:12.717 --> 00:13:15.550\nNow keyboard seems like an odd\nplace to go for this, but\n\n295\n00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.407\nthis is me talking to the computer.\n\n296\n00:13:17.407 --> 00:13:18.704\nAnd when I talk to the computer,\n\n297\n00:13:18.704 --> 00:13:22.450\nit's gotta turn it into text which is\neffectively a voice keyboard, right?\n\n298\n00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.560\nAnd so when I go into the keyboard\nsettings, you'll see dictation\n\n299\n00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.130\nright up there, and here's where you\ncan start to configure dictation.\n\n300\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.760\nNow every single Mac has a microphone\nbuilt into these days, so if you have\n\n301\n00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.720\na MacBook Pro, or a MacBook Air, you have\nan iMac, they've all got microphones.\n\n302\n00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.690\nActually the Mac Pro,\n\n303\n00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.770\nI think it leverages the microphone in the\nmonitor if you have the cinema display.\n\n304\n00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.702\nYou could end up in a situation\nwithout a microphone.\n\n305\n00:13:46.702 --> 00:13:47.922\nMost of them do.\n\n306\n00:13:47.922 --> 00:13:50.800\nAnd you'll see as soon as I go to\nthis tool, it's recognizing me.\n\n307\n00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.890\nIt's got my internal microphone right\nhere and it's hearing my voice.\n\n308\n00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.820\nNow, rule number one of voice dictation.\n\n309\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.570\nIf you're going to be talking to the\ncomputer it needs to be able to hear you\n\n310\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.330\nas clear as possible.\n\n311\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.930\nAnd while the microphone built\nin your system is decent enough,\n\n312\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.270\nit's not the greatest.\n\n313\n00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.730\nAnd so you might want to add\nan additional microphone.\n\n314\n00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.290\nSo for example when I go to my office and\n\n315\n00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.770\nI hit my little docking station,\nI've a different microphone in my office.\n\n316\n00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.890\nAnd so you can drop this arrow down right\nhere, and you can pick between your\n\n317\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.870\ndifferent audio options for\nwho it is that your using as a microphone.\n\n318\n00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.430\nA little shortcut for that,\n\n319\n00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.557\nup in your menu bar you've\ngot your little speaker icon.\n\n320\n00:14:26.557 --> 00:14:31.305\nAnd by default when you click on that,\nyou're gonna see your volume, right?\n\n321\n00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:34.495\nAnd you've got your output devices\nthat you can pick from here to.\n\n322\n00:14:34.495 --> 00:14:36.410\nThat wasn't always there.\n\n323\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.930\nIt used to be you had to\nhold down the alt key,\n\n324\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.070\nto get where you could\npick your output devices.\n\n325\n00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.580\nNow though if you click on it,\nyou will see the output devices, but\n\n326\n00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.900\nnot your input.\n\n327\n00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.110\nIf you hold the alt and click on it,\nnow you see input also.\n\n328\n00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:54.090\nSo you can click quickly change\nmicrophones by holding the alt key and\n\n329\n00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:57.850\nclicking on that little speaker icon,\nup there in you menu bar.\n\n330\n00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.109\nQuick and easy way to change without\ngoing to system preferences.\n\n331\n00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.020\nAll right, but once you're in here there's\nnot a whole lot of options to configure\n\n332\n00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.110\nfor dictation.\n\n333\n00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.970\nBasically you can turn it on or off.\n\n334\n00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:12.750\nIf you turn it on, it's gonna offer\nto use Enhanced Dictation, right?\n\n335\n00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.610\nSo what is that?\n\n336\n00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.430\nWell Enhanced Dictation, what it does?\n\n337\n00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.247\nIs it reaches out to Apple.\n\n338\n00:15:16.247 --> 00:15:20.771\nIt downloads just over a gigabyte\nof voice data, signature data, so\n\n339\n00:15:20.771 --> 00:15:23.813\nthat when you talk it can\nhash a voice signal and\n\n340\n00:15:23.813 --> 00:15:27.715\nrun it against this to get\nbetter identification, right?\n\n341\n00:15:27.715 --> 00:15:31.756\nSiri take your voice, takes a hash\nof it and sends it up to Apple, so\n\n342\n00:15:31.756 --> 00:15:34.518\nSiri really requires an online connection.\n\n343\n00:15:34.518 --> 00:15:38.491\nThis one can work offline, but it doesn't\nhave the advantage of a huge data center\n\n344\n00:15:38.491 --> 00:15:41.280\nat Apple's headquarter\nprocessing this stuff.\n\n345\n00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.020\nSo by downloading this files,\n\n346\n00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.120\nit can be much more accurate,\nbeen running without it.\n\n347\n00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.920\nIf you're gonna use this a lot,\n\n348\n00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.260\ndefinitely choose to use\nthe Enhanced Dictation, all right?\n\n349\n00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.920\nIf you're not gonna use it a lot,\nthen it doesn't matter.\n\n350\n00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.620\nYou can say not now.\n\n351\n00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.401\nYou could turn it on later if you\nwanted it, and download it and go.\n\n352\n00:15:56.401 --> 00:15:59.393\nIf you do choose to use it,\nit does take a little while to download.\n\n353\n00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:02.816\nApple servers, they.\n\n354\n00:16:02.816 --> 00:16:05.256\nThey don't have, it's not that they\ndon't have the fastest servers,\n\n355\n00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:06.576\nthey don't need the fastest servers.\n\n356\n00:16:06.576 --> 00:16:09.079\nSo the ones that are out there\ndo download kind of slow.\n\n357\n00:16:09.079 --> 00:16:11.500\nIt'll probably take 10 or\n15 minutes to download.\n\n358\n00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.340\nI'm just gonna say not now, for right now.\n\n359\n00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.100\nBut if I was using this on a regular\nbasis, I would want to turn that on.\n\n360\n00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.930\nOnce it's done, you'll see where it\nprompts me to turn on Enhanced Dictation.\n\n361\n00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:21.930\nAnd then, it's saying.\n\n362\n00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.830\nWithout enhanced dictation, what you say\nis sent to Apple to be converted to text,\n\n363\n00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.550\nit's using the Apple Data Center.\n\n364\n00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.110\nAgain, if I'm not online,\nit can't do that.\n\n365\n00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.110\nI really want that offline\nenhanced dictation.\n\n366\n00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.530\nNow my data isn't being sent to Apple.\n\n367\n00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.190\nSo you get that choice,\nI'm gonna go ahead and enable it.\n\n368\n00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.960\nAnd now that it's turned on\nI can always come back and\n\n369\n00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.460\nturn on the enhanced dictation if I want.\n\n370\n00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.010\nThen if I look here I've got my shortcut.\n\n371\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.310\nThis is the most important part.\n\n372\n00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.100\nWell I guess language is pretty\nimportant if you pick the wrong\n\n373\n00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.060\nlanguage it's not gonna\nrecognize what you're saying.\n\n374\n00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.150\nBut here, press the function key twice.\n\n375\n00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.710\nOn my laptop I've got a function key and\non most Apple keyboards you do.\n\n376\n00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.320\nIf you're not using an Apple keyboard\nthough, you might not have a function key.\n\n377\n00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.270\nAnd that's very common for\npeople who have like a braille keyboard\n\n378\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.490\nwhere they might not have\nstandard keys around there.\n\n379\n00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.368\nSo when you drop that down you'll see\nwhere you can pick different keys or\n\n380\n00:17:08.368 --> 00:17:10.174\neven customize, create your own shortcut.\n\n381\n00:17:10.174 --> 00:17:12.382\nBut the default here is\nthat if I hit Fn twice,\n\n382\n00:17:12.382 --> 00:17:16.670\nit's gonna start listening to what I'm\nsaying and trying to dictate it, okay?\n\n383\n00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.820\nSo if I fire up something like text edit.\n\n384\n00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.600\nAnd let me just do a new document here and\n\n385\n00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.290\ncrank my font up to something that\nwe'll actually be able to see.\n\n386\n00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.390\nWe'll see if we can run a quick test,\nhere.\n\n387\n00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.200\nThis is a quick test.\n\n388\n00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.260\nThere we go, very exciting.\n\n389\n00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.000\nSo it recognized my voice.\n\n390\n00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.320\nIt typed it out.\n\n391\n00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.080\nAnd there we go, right.\n\n392\n00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.890\nSo that's voice dictation.\n\n393\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.990\nI didn't have enhanced mode turned on so\nwhen I spoke it took that signature,\n\n394\n00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.320\nsend it up to Apple, and\nthen brought it back again.\n\n395\n00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.620\nIf I wanted this to work offline,\nI would need to go in and\n\n396\n00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.570\ndownload the enhanced dictation files.\n\n397\n00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.540\nAnd so as soon as I check that off,\nI can see right down here,\n\n398\n00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.990\npreparing to download.\n\n399\n00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.958\nAnd then in about 10 to 15 minutes,\nit will have it and\n\n400\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.750\nnow I'll be able to work offline as well.\n\n401\n00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.050\n&gt;&gt; Well Don,\ncan we use this to also issue commands?\n\n402\n00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.300\nObviously, I think, we could\nprobably do that with maybe Siri or\n\n403\n00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.990\nwould this allow that as well.\n\n404\n00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.750\n&gt;&gt; You actually can set up\na few commands in here.\n\n405\n00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:13.370\nWhat you'll find is if you start\nlooking at like short cuts and things.\n\n406\n00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.470\nWell, it's gonna be mad at me\nbecause I'm downloading now but\n\n407\n00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.490\nyou can actually set up shortcuts\nthat use voice commands.\n\n408\n00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.060\nBut these days Apple's really trying\nto move that stuff over to Siri.\n\n409\n00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.480\nThat if you want to interact with\nyour system like issuing commands and\n\n410\n00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.440\ngetting feedback,\nSiri's kind of the way to go on that.\n\n411\n00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.150\nBut inside of dictation\nyou do have that ability.\n\n412\n00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.470\nYou can jump into Apple's\nhelp documentation.\n\n413\n00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.526\nThey kind of lay out how it works and\nyou can get that set up.\n\n414\n00:18:36.526 --> 00:18:39.233\nThere's actually a lot of\nhidden voice commands.\n\n415\n00:18:39.233 --> 00:18:41.213\nWell, not hidden,\nthey're just on Apple's site,\n\n416\n00:18:41.213 --> 00:18:44.170\nthat you can find and it's tons of stuff\nthat help you interact with the system.\n\n417\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:48.620\nAll right, so I've mentioned Siri a few\ntimes, let's talk a little bit about her.\n\n418\n00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:53.290\nObviously since El Capitan,\nApple has really been proud of Siri,\n\n419\n00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:54.060\nthey've been rolling it out.\n\n420\n00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.600\nWe've got Siri on the desktop now.\n\n421\n00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.560\nIt came out on the iPhone originally.\n\n422\n00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.660\nAnd then later made the jump to iPad,\nright.\n\n423\n00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.350\nSo it was on these mobile devices.\n\n424\n00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.000\nAnd now we actually\nhave it on our desktop.\n\n425\n00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.720\nNow, Siri on the desktop is a little bit\ndifferent than Siri on your phone, right.\n\n426\n00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:14.350\nBecause on my phone, I might say,\nhey Siri, navigate to Whataburger.\n\n427\n00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.500\nThere's no Whataburger in town.\n\n428\n00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.010\nI don't know why that popped into mind,\nbut.\n\n429\n00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.060\nSo if I say navigate there, right.\n\n430\n00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.220\nAnd then she's gonna pull up the map,\nshe's gonna find it,\n\n431\n00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.750\nshe's gonna start giving me directions.\n\n432\n00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:26.000\nNow if I'm sitting at my desk\nin my office, and I say, hey,\n\n433\n00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.630\nlet's navigate to whatever.\n\n434\n00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.270\nI'm on my desktop, right?\n\n435\n00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.660\nIt's not gonna help me.\n\n436\n00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.090\nSo we do lose some of the functionality of\nSiri because it's not a mobile device, and\n\n437\n00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.850\nthat's really where it\nwas developed first.\n\n438\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:37.945\nBut it's quickly evolving.\n\n439\n00:19:37.945 --> 00:19:41.080\nThey're adding new features all\nthe time and now we actually can make\n\n440\n00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.800\nuse of it right on our desktop to\nbe able to do a lot of fun stuff.\n\n441\n00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.500\nAnd when you install Mac OS Sierra, you\nprobably notice, Siri is on by default.\n\n442\n00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.940\nAnd you can see it right\nup here in my menu bar.\n\n443\n00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.624\nThe little Siri icon,\nright there, she's there.\n\n444\n00:19:53.624 --> 00:19:55.057\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure I understand.\n\n445\n00:19:55.057 --> 00:19:56.572\nNope, I'm not talking to you.\n\n446\n00:19:56.572 --> 00:19:59.340\n[LAUGH] So she's there and\nshe's ready to listen.\n\n447\n00:19:59.340 --> 00:19:59.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes she is.\n\n448\n00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.290\n&gt;&gt; Whether you want it or not.\n\n449\n00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.140\n&gt;&gt; A therapist that comes\nwith your operating system.\n\n450\n00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.518\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so lets take a look at Siri.\n\n451\n00:20:05.518 --> 00:20:09.096\nIf I go into my system preferences,\nyou'll see the Siri icon right here.\n\n452\n00:20:09.096 --> 00:20:10.480\nAnd if I jump into Siri,\n\n453\n00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:15.760\nthere's not a whole lot to tweak here\nbecause she's designed to be super easy.\n\n454\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.590\nSo I'll see where I pick the language.\n\n455\n00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.630\nAnd there are a number of\nlanguages supported by Siri.\n\n456\n00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.750\nWhich is a big difference from some of\nthe competitors that are out there.\n\n457\n00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:27.850\nSome of the other ones like Samsung's\nBixby that only supports Korean right now,\n\n458\n00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:28.890\nnot even English.\n\n459\n00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.050\nYou've got the Google AI system,\n\n460\n00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.290\nsome of the other ones that only\nsupport a handful of languages.\n\n461\n00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:36.350\nApple has been at this a while longer,\nso they've got more languages supported.\n\n462\n00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:40.790\nYou can specify Siri's voice at default to\nthe iconic female voice that most of us\n\n463\n00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:44.340\nare used to, but you can choose\nother ones, American, Australian.\n\n464\n00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.410\nNotice that all these\nvoices are English so\n\n465\n00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:52.260\nwhether I choose a language as English or\nnot up here is going to impact that right?\n\n466\n00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:57.020\nSo if I come in and I choose to go to\nCantonese, now I only get one voice and\n\n467\n00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.930\nit is in Cantonese, right?\n\n468\n00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.360\nSo it is tailored off of what\nlanguage I pick up here.\n\n469\n00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.580\nAll right, then,\nwhether I want voice feedback.\n\n470\n00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.610\nVoice feedback means do I want responses\nwhen I issue a command or whatever,\n\n471\n00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.370\ndo I want responses back from her.\n\n472\n00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.295\nSometimes you don't, you're like,\njust do what I tell you and that's that.\n\n473\n00:21:13.295 --> 00:21:16.003\n[LAUGH] It's not the friendliest\nrelationship you can\n\n474\n00:21:16.003 --> 00:21:18.445\nhave with your computer but\nyou can set that up.\n\n475\n00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:19.133\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The microphone,\n\n476\n00:21:19.133 --> 00:21:20.293\nthis is your default microphone.\n\n477\n00:21:20.293 --> 00:21:23.033\nIt's gonna default to whatever's\ninternal to your system, but again,\n\n478\n00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:25.290\nyou might have other\nmicrophones on your system.\n\n479\n00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:26.227\nYou can choose that.\n\n480\n00:21:26.227 --> 00:21:28.934\nAnd then the keyboard short cut for\nactivating Siri.\n\n481\n00:21:28.934 --> 00:21:33.711\nNow, this is different than on a phone\nwhere you can setup just listen for\n\n482\n00:21:33.711 --> 00:21:35.760\nyou to say, hey Siri, right?\n\n483\n00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:42.328\nBut we need a keyboard shortcut to trigger\nthis, and the default is Cmd+Space.\n\n484\n00:21:42.328 --> 00:21:45.300\nNow, Cmd+Space is what launches Spotlight.\n\n485\n00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.360\nI use it every single day.\n\n486\n00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.710\nWhen I hit Cmd+Space,\nthere it is, Spotlight.\n\n487\n00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.920\nSo it's holding Cmd+Space.\n\n488\n00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.670\nIf I hold it down, there comes Siri\nup on the screen, listening to me.\n\n489\n00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.895\nLet me close that before she\nsays she doesn't understand.\n\n490\n00:21:58.895 --> 00:21:59.970\n[LAUGH] And there we go.\n\n491\n00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:00.815\nAnd that was there.\n\n492\n00:22:00.815 --> 00:22:02.015\nSo you can customize that and\nchange it, though.\n\n493\n00:22:02.015 --> 00:22:03.570\nIf it gets in the way of what you do,\n\n494\n00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.910\nyou can specify all sorts of different\nthings to be able to activate Siri.\n\n495\n00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:12.124\nOne of the ones I like is, there's like\nfunction-space or hold-option-space.\n\n496\n00:22:12.124 --> 00:22:15.902\nYou can set up a hold combination for\na single key and that's really handy for\n\n497\n00:22:15.902 --> 00:22:19.590\npeople that have a hard time holding\nmore than one key at the same time.\n\n498\n00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.922\nThat happens, unfortunately,\nall too often.\n\n499\n00:22:21.922 --> 00:22:23.267\nAll right.\n\n500\n00:22:23.267 --> 00:22:27.161\nNow, as far as getting Siri set up, the\nonly other options we really have are to\n\n501\n00:22:27.161 --> 00:22:30.710\nenable her and to show her in the menu\nbar, which are both on by default.\n\n502\n00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:34.750\nWell, let me clarify that, when you\ninitially install Mac OS it actually\n\n503\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.930\ndoes give you a screen where\nshe is enabled by default.\n\n504\n00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.520\nYou have the option to turn\nher off during the install.\n\n505\n00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.100\nAnd you can always come back in here\nturn her back on if you want, or\n\n506\n00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.060\nif you don't want Siri on,\nyou can turn it off and there we go.\n\n507\n00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.160\nThere are some people out there\nwho are super paranoid and\n\n508\n00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.610\nsay I don't want my\ncomputer listening to me.\n\n509\n00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:50.990\nI want to turn that off.\n\n510\n00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.490\nWell, if somebody is gonna go to\nthe trouble listening on your microphone,\n\n511\n00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.450\nit's not gonna matter if you\ncheck enable here, or not.\n\n512\n00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:57.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz they can turn that on.\n\n513\n00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.160\nSo, don't be paranoid,\nif you're gonna use it,\n\n514\n00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.490\nturn it on, if you're not gonna use it,\nturn it off.\n\n515\n00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:02.460\nBut that's really about it.\n\n516\n00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.709\nThe paranoia shouldn't really\nenter into that decision.\n\n517\n00:23:04.709 --> 00:23:07.919\nBut once it's there,\nit's pretty easy to use and\n\n518\n00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:10.755\nyou can get some pretty interesting stuff.\n\n519\n00:23:10.755 --> 00:23:14.970\nIt depends on what you\nconsider interesting,\n\n520\n00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.868\nyou can say, Siri, what's the weather?\n\n521\n00:23:18.868 --> 00:23:21.010\n&gt;&gt; I don't know where you are but\nyou can help me find out.\n\n522\n00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.050\nIn security and privacy settings,\nchoose the privacy tab.\n\n523\n00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:29.850\nUnder location services, check enable\nlocation services and Siri and dictation.\n\n524\n00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, so here's an example of\na Siri configuration I need to do.\n\n525\n00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:36.930\nI asked her what the weather was.\n\n526\n00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.150\nShe doesn't know where I am, right?\n\n527\n00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:41.340\nI don't have a GPS in the laptop,\nso she can't find where I am.\n\n528\n00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.980\nSo I need to get that set up, so\nshe gave me the instructions.\n\n529\n00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.610\nHere's where you need to go and\nget that set up.\n\n530\n00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:46.400\nNow notice.\n\n531\n00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.620\nShe didn't offer to set it up for me.\n\n532\n00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.877\nShe didn't say, hey Don,\nwhat's your zip code?\n\n533\n00:23:48.877 --> 00:23:49.844\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n534\n00:23:49.844 --> 00:23:52.560\n&gt;&gt; She can't do that,\nshe's not that powerful yet.\n\n535\n00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.917\n&gt;&gt; If you were more specific.\n\n536\n00:23:53.917 --> 00:23:56.220\nYou said what is the weather\nin Gainesville, Florida,\n\n537\n00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.596\nwould she be able to answer that?\n\n538\n00:23:57.596 --> 00:24:00.116\n&gt;&gt; I would hope so [LAUGH].\n\n539\n00:24:00.116 --> 00:24:02.028\nWhat is the weather in Gainesville,\nFlorida?\n\n540\n00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.040\nOkay, here's the weather for\nGainesville, Florida for today.\n\n541\n00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:07.944\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n542\n00:24:07.944 --> 00:24:12.767\nAnd so not only do I get a auditory\nresponse, I get that voice feedback, but\n\n543\n00:24:12.767 --> 00:24:15.613\nI also get a visual\nresponse of the weather.\n\n544\n00:24:15.613 --> 00:24:18.631\nAnd it's important because she didn't\nactually tell me what the weather\n\n545\n00:24:18.631 --> 00:24:19.740\nwas, did she?\n\n546\n00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.530\n&gt;&gt; No she did not.\n\n547\n00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.352\n&gt;&gt; No, I got the voice feedback,\nand that's it.\n\n548\n00:24:22.352 --> 00:24:24.280\nAnd then I get the visual response.\n\n549\n00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.700\nSo that's another example of where Siri\nis not a replacement for accessibility,\n\n550\n00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.970\nat least not yet.\n\n551\n00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:30.829\nShe's getting there.\n\n552\n00:24:30.829 --> 00:24:33.156\nThey're adding new stuff\nto her all the time.\n\n553\n00:24:33.156 --> 00:24:34.720\nEventually, she will be there.\n\n554\n00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.010\nBut right now,\nit's still two separate systems.\n\n555\n00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.920\nSo if you're wondering, why do we have\nthese two completely separate entities?\n\n556\n00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.060\nIt's because they really\ndo fit a different purpose.\n\n557\n00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.750\nSiri is more of a novelty,\nease of use, type thing.\n\n558\n00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.530\nI hate to call it a novelty,\n\n559\n00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:51.538\nthat's what it is, but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n560\n00:24:51.538 --> 00:24:52.320\n&gt;&gt; I hate to call it that because\n\n561\n00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.460\nI know that one day it will\nbe extremely powerful, right?\n\n562\n00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.020\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n563\n00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.278\nright now it is mostly just\na convenience utility.\n\n564\n00:24:58.278 --> 00:25:02.950\nVersus voice over and voice dictation,\nwhere that's a necessity for\n\n565\n00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:03.690\na lot of people.\n\n566\n00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.910\nSo that tool's not messing around,\nthat's important stuff.\n\n567\n00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:11.720\nSo if you're having to support anyone\nthat needs voice functionality like this,\n\n568\n00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.900\nanybody with a visual impairment or\njust finds it easier to use this way,\n\n569\n00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.530\nyou need to familiarize\nyourself with these tools.\n\n570\n00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.762\nYou will encounter them out\nthere in the real world and\n\n571\n00:25:19.762 --> 00:25:22.110\nthey are very important to people.\n\n572\n00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.160\nSo whether you think it's useful or\nnot doesn't matter.\n\n573\n00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.790\nIf they think it's useful you should do\nwhatever you can to make sure they get\n\n574\n00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.920\nthe best computer experience possible\nwhen working with the computer.\n\n575\n00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.080\nThat's really what it's all about.\n\n576\n00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.520\n&gt;&gt; Now Don going back to\nissuing commands with Siri,\n\n577\n00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.350\nam I able to say to Siri you know open\nFinder and she'll open the Finder?\n\n578\n00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.570\nCuz like you asked her about the weather,\nshe said,\n\n579\n00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:44.060\nhere are some steps you can go through\nif you let me know where you're at so\n\n580\n00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.420\nthat I can make sure that you get\nthe weather that you're looking for\n\n581\n00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.280\nwhen you ask a more generalized question.\n\n582\n00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.250\nBut if I say, open Finder,\ncan she do that?\n\n583\n00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.710\n&gt;&gt; It's a mixed bag what she can do and\n\n584\n00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.660\ncan't do, and sometimes you have\nto experiment around with it.\n\n585\n00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:58.230\nApple has a posted list on their website\nof the various commands she supports.\n\n586\n00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:02.231\nLet me just try like [NOISE]\nLaunch activity monitor.\n\n587\n00:26:02.231 --> 00:26:04.911\n[SOUND] There we go, right?\n\n588\n00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:07.165\nSo I told her to launch an application.\n\n589\n00:26:07.165 --> 00:26:09.324\nShe fired it up, and there we go.\n\n590\n00:26:09.324 --> 00:26:09.936\nAs your commands get more and\n\n591\n00:26:09.936 --> 00:26:11.170\nmore complex you run the risk\nof starting to lose things.\n\n592\n00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.950\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n593\n00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:20.434\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Search for word documents.\n\n594\n00:26:20.434 --> 00:26:23.186\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] I found these documents.\n\n595\n00:26:23.186 --> 00:26:26.136\n&gt;&gt; So here she returned some documents\nthat she found on the computer, and\n\n596\n00:26:26.136 --> 00:26:27.970\nwe can jump in, we can start to see these.\n\n597\n00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.260\nThat's the kind of functionality\nthat we have now, and\n\n598\n00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.800\nover time we'll start to see\nthat increase and become better.\n\n599\n00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.870\nBut if I had told her to launch\nthe activity monitor, and then told her to\n\n600\n00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.790\nchange to the memory tab, well, she can't\nactually interact with the application.\n\n601\n00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.034\nShe can launch it for me, but\nthen she can't interact with it.\n\n602\n00:26:42.034 --> 00:26:44.095\nNot yet.\nOne day we'll see that, but\n\n603\n00:26:44.095 --> 00:26:45.820\nthat day is not today.\n\n604\n00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:50.190\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don, again, I know\nthat we have a bit more to go but, again,\n\n605\n00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.680\nthe time is not on our side for\nthis episode.\n\n606\n00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.765\nSo we'll have to come back for\na part three.\n\n607\n00:26:55.765 --> 00:26:57.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And continue with more\n\n608\n00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.320\nwhat can we do with the application\nsupport inside of Sierra.\n\n609\n00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.232\nSo Don, I look forward to\nseeing you in that episode.\n\n610\n00:27:03.232 --> 00:27:07.560\nI look forward to seeing our lovely\nguests as well, but as for this episode,\n\n611\n00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.242\nlooks like its time for us to sign off.\n\n612\n00:27:09.242 --> 00:27:11.560\nFor ITPRO.TV,\nI have been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n613\n00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.480\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n614\n00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.793\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n615\n00:27:13.793 --> 00:27:19.684\n[MUSIC]\n\n616\n00:27:19.684 --> 00:27:23.125\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:11.994\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:12.654\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n5\n00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:16.949\ngreetings everyone and welcome back\nto another great episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.433\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:22.620\nwe're back with more\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n8\n00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.009\nAnd joining us in the studio, yet again,\nfor a part three on application support.\n\n9\n00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.730\nMr. Don Pezet, Don, welcome back, man.\n\n10\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.400\nHow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.222\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, and who knew, how\ndifficult it was to support applications.\n\n12\n00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:33.374\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Turns out-\n\n13\n00:00:33.374 --> 00:00:33.955\n&gt;&gt; That's all you do.\n\n14\n00:00:33.955 --> 00:00:35.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of stuff,right,\n\n15\n00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.897\nthere's a lot of things to get\ninvolved when running applications.\n\n16\n00:00:37.897 --> 00:00:40.188\nSo we're gonna continue looking\nat here in this episode,\n\n17\n00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:42.680\nit's not necessarily\nthe applications themselves.\n\n18\n00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.390\nBut all the stuff that we have to\ndo around them, to keep them up and\n\n19\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.600\nrunning and happy and so on,\n\n20\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.140\nwhich does include some interesting\nthings that we need to be aware of.\n\n21\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.710\nSo, we're going to continue running\nwith that school of thought.\n\n22\n00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.240\nIn this episode,\n\n23\n00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.442\nwe are going to take a look at 64-bit\napplications which are pretty important.\n\n24\n00:00:57.442 --> 00:01:00.858\nWe're gonna talk a little bit about what\nto do when applications go wrong, and\n\n25\n00:01:00.858 --> 00:01:02.795\nwe'll see how to force quit applications.\n\n26\n00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:04.942\nAnd look at our diagnostic logs\nto figure out what happened, and\n\n27\n00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:07.029\nkinda troubleshoot problems\nthat we have with application.\n\n28\n00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:10.595\nSo all in all, pretty run of the mill for\na day in the life of an IT worker,\n\n29\n00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:12.979\nright, if you're doing\nMac desktop support.\n\n30\n00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.265\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is true, now,\nDon we are talking about the latest and\n\n31\n00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:18.480\ngreatest of Mac operating systems.\n\n32\n00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.480\nAnd usually, when a new operating\nsystem comes out, they do that for\n\n33\n00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.130\nreasons, right?\n\n34\n00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.420\nThey make a new OS for reasons, because\nthey've increased it's abilities, right?\n\n35\n00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.850\nI would assume that's\nwith application support,\n\n36\n00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.460\nthat is no separate issue,\nthat there is new functionality there.\n\n37\n00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.550\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, about six years ago,\nmaybe seven years ago.\n\n38\n00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.820\nApple made the switch to being\na 64-bit operating system, so\n\n39\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.930\nMacOS previously to that,\nwas a 32-bit operating system.\n\n40\n00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.930\nAnd they switched to 64-bit, now,\nwhat the heck does that mean?\n\n41\n00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.420\nWell, when a computer addresses memory,\nright?\n\n42\n00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.572\nYou've got RAM, inside of your computer,\n\n43\n00:01:51.572 --> 00:01:55.430\nand, each little bit that gets stored\nin RAM has to have an address.\n\n44\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.414\nIt's just like an address on a house,\nand so, if I say,\n\n45\n00:01:58.414 --> 00:02:03.066\nthis is building number 7525, I know\nthat's different than building 7526.\n\n46\n00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.080\nSo, the number is how we identify it.\n\n47\n00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.044\nAnd, in a 32-bit operating system,\nyou have 32-bits available for\n\n48\n00:02:10.044 --> 00:02:12.020\nreferencing memory.\n\n49\n00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.120\nWell, a 32-bit number can only go\nup to a certain amount, right?\n\n50\n00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.979\nIf we were to convert that\nbinary number into decimal,\n\n51\n00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.850\nit's somewhere around 4.3 billion or\nso, right?\n\n52\n00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.300\nSo, that's the maximum number\nyou can have on a 32-bit system.\n\n53\n00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.030\nWell, when you're addressing your memory\nthat way, that means the maximum amount of\n\n54\n00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.680\nmemory you can address is four gigabytes,\nsorry, so four gigabytes of memory.\n\n55\n00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.250\nWell, we've had Macs with more than\nfour gigabytes for a long time,\n\n56\n00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.770\nyou can get some Mac Pros back in the day,\nthat eight or 16 gigabytes.\n\n57\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.198\nSo if the operating system can\nhandle more than 16 gigabytes,\n\n58\n00:02:47.198 --> 00:02:49.911\nwhy do I care if it's 32-bit or not?\n\n59\n00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:52.130\nWell, the problem came\nwith the applications.\n\n60\n00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.980\nIf your application was\na 32-bit application,\n\n61\n00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.780\nit could only address\nup to four gigs of RAM.\n\n62\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.821\nNow for most people, that's way more\nthan they need, if you're firing up\n\n63\n00:03:02.821 --> 00:03:07.135\na web browser and in pages, iMovies and\nyou do a couple simple things like that.\n\n64\n00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:08.081\n&gt;&gt; Or chrome, maybe.\n\n65\n00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:11.234\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, even chrome though,\n\n66\n00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:13.730\nif you look at google chrome\nwhich is a memory hog, right?\n\n67\n00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.378\nEvery tab runs it's own process, well,\n\n68\n00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:20.570\nchrome as a whole might be\neating two gigs of RAM.\n\n69\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.990\nEach tab is really eating\nabout 200 megs of RAM, and so,\n\n70\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.520\nit can go really big because of that.\n\n71\n00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.910\nGoogle did that on purpose,\nit still eats way too much memory.\n\n72\n00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.778\nBut that's a challenge you can't\novercome in some applications, Google,\n\n73\n00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:34.095\nthey found a way, right?\n\n74\n00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:35.455\nBut I mentioned iMovie,\n\n75\n00:03:35.455 --> 00:03:39.225\niMovie's not the best example cuz\nit relies on disc pretty heavily.\n\n76\n00:03:39.225 --> 00:03:41.295\nAdobe Premiere is a great example.\n\n77\n00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:45.921\nWhere if I open up a two gigabyte\nmovie clip inside of Adobe Premier,\n\n78\n00:03:45.921 --> 00:03:47.633\ndo you know what it does?\n\n79\n00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:49.972\nIt caches it to ram, so it'll try and\n\n80\n00:03:49.972 --> 00:03:53.232\nget as much of that video\nclip into ram as possible.\n\n81\n00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:58.230\nAnd if it's only two gigs, it can do that,\nwhat if it's an eight gig video clip?\n\n82\n00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.837\nIt can't cache it in a RAM,\nif it's a 32-bit application.\n\n83\n00:04:00.837 --> 00:04:04.470\nIt can cache 4 gigs of it into RAM,\nthe rest of it?\n\n84\n00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.540\nIt just can't cache it, it's got to read\nfrom disk which means it's gonna be slow.\n\n85\n00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.700\nSo if you want an application\nto be able to take advantage\n\n86\n00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.500\nof more than four gigs of RAM,\nit's got to be a 64-bit application.\n\n87\n00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.890\nNow, back in the day, seven years ago.\n\n88\n00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.710\nThis was a big deal,\nApple release support for it,\n\n89\n00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.950\nand then the developers had to catch up.\n\n90\n00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.150\nThe developers had to convert their apps\nover to 64-bit, which believe it or not,\n\n91\n00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.539\nit's actually not that hard at all.\n\n92\n00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.398\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you really, just go and\n\n93\n00:04:30.398 --> 00:04:33.486\nrecompile it, but you would be shock\nthat how many developers took years and\n\n94\n00:04:33.486 --> 00:04:35.940\nyears to finally make that\nswitch over to being 64-bit.\n\n95\n00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.180\nAnd there's a reason for that,\nbut it's happened, right?\n\n96\n00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.351\nIt's happened a lot more quickly\nin recent years, so that now,\n\n97\n00:04:42.351 --> 00:04:46.243\nit's pretty uncommon that you find\nan application that's still 32-bit.\n\n98\n00:04:46.243 --> 00:04:48.114\nMost of them flipped over to 64-bit and\n\n99\n00:04:48.114 --> 00:04:51.020\nthey're able to address way\nmore than four gigs of RAM.\n\n100\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.160\nAnd that's great because most\nof your MacBooks this days,\n\n101\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.320\ncomes with 16 gigs of RAM.\n\n102\n00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.820\nWell, if you're running five or\nsix different applications,\n\n103\n00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.030\nthey can all splice that up and\nit's not a big deal.\n\n104\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.580\nBut if you have one app that you wanna\nconsume as much memory as possible,\n\n105\n00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.950\nyou'll want that application to be 64-bit.\n\n106\n00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.660\nNow Adobe, they updated their\nentire creative suite to 64-bit, so\n\n107\n00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.980\nthey all run that way.\n\n108\n00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.240\nApple updated all their applications,\nFinal Cut X, or\n\n109\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.770\nwhatever they call it these days,\nthey're the crappy one.\n\n110\n00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.506\nEven the older, Final Cut Pro that\ndidn't suck, that one [LAUGH] is 64-bit.\n\n111\n00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:27.146\nYou've got other applications that\nhave all made that jump over, but\n\n112\n00:05:27.146 --> 00:05:29.620\nthere are some applications\nthat still haven't.\n\n113\n00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.580\nAnd that can be a bit of a challenge,\n\n114\n00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.320\nif you have an application\nthat's running slow or whatever.\n\n115\n00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.585\nIt could be that when\nsomebody installed it,\n\n116\n00:05:37.585 --> 00:05:42.095\nthey chose to install the 32-bit version\ninstead of the 64-bit version, right?\n\n117\n00:05:42.095 --> 00:05:44.275\nBecause there will be multiple versions.\n\n118\n00:05:44.275 --> 00:05:48.505\nSo when you go to download an application\nto get it installed, it's always important\n\n119\n00:05:48.505 --> 00:05:52.805\nto check and make sure you're installing\nthe 64-bit version if you can.\n\n120\n00:05:52.805 --> 00:05:56.780\nIf the developer only lists one version,\nthen you don't really have a choice.\n\n121\n00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.600\nSo it doesn't really matter what\nwe want anymore at that point.\n\n122\n00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.810\nBut if they give you a choice\nbetween 32-bit and 64-bit,\n\n123\n00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.940\nyou wanna make sure you choose\nthe 64-bit option wherever possible.\n\n124\n00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.400\nNow, there is one scenario\nthat I can think of,\n\n125\n00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.840\nwhere you might still want a 32-bit\nversion of an application.\n\n126\n00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.700\nAnd that's when you have got\nan application that uses plugins, and\n\n127\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.780\nthe best example for\nthat was a web browser, right?\n\n128\n00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.390\nMost web browsers use plugins.\n\n129\n00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.236\nFor example,\nSAFARI is designed to show HTML,\n\n130\n00:06:23.236 --> 00:06:27.309\nHTML5 type content and\nregular, even old HTML.\n\n131\n00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:30.720\nIt's not designed to show JAVA,\nit can't show JAVA by default.\n\n132\n00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.890\nBut if I install the JAVA framework,\n\n133\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.350\nnow, I can run job applets\ninside of the web browser.\n\n134\n00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.910\nThat's a plugin,\nI have added that functionality.\n\n135\n00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.120\nAdobe Flash is another thing,\na very high visibility thing there.\n\n136\n00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.960\nWe install Flash and\n\n137\n00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.190\nnow we get you a Flash animations\ninside of our web browser.\n\n138\n00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.577\nIf my web browser goes 64-bit,\n\n139\n00:06:48.577 --> 00:06:52.970\nthe plugins have to go 64-bit also,\nand that took a while.\n\n140\n00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.233\nIt took a while for\nall plugin developers to update to 64-bit,\n\n141\n00:06:56.233 --> 00:06:58.550\nso the big applications\ncould update to 64-bit.\n\n142\n00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:04.320\nSo we saw a lot of,\nkind of push back from developers\n\n143\n00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.500\nwhere they kinda clung to the 32-bit model\nfor probably longer than they should have.\n\n144\n00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.940\nToday, though,\nwhen you download applications,\n\n145\n00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.710\nmake sure that you get the 64-bit one.\n\n146\n00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.557\nIf you're troubleshooting, right, so\n\n147\n00:07:14.557 --> 00:07:18.477\nmaybe you find out that your users are all\nusing the 32-bit version and application.\n\n148\n00:07:18.477 --> 00:07:22.610\nAnd you're like, I wanna go and try\nthe 64-bit, and something is not working.\n\n149\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.650\nThere's actually a little failback\nmechanism in a lot of apps,\n\n150\n00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.070\nif the app still have both versions.\n\n151\n00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.600\nLet me show you an example, so\non my laptop I've got Firefox.\n\n152\n00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.846\nNow, I installed the 64-bit\nversion of Firefox,\n\n153\n00:07:34.846 --> 00:07:39.838\nwhen you go to their website and download\nit which is on mozilla.org, I believe.\n\n154\n00:07:39.838 --> 00:07:42.296\nThen you go to their website and\nyou can download it, and\n\n155\n00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:44.970\nit defaults to downloading\nthe 64-bit version.\n\n156\n00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.470\nSo if I just come in here and say,\nI'm gonna download it, I come in here,\n\n157\n00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.520\nit goes to download.\n\n158\n00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.677\nAnd see, how it's not even telling me\nwhether or not it's gonna be 64 or 32-bit?\n\n159\n00:07:54.677 --> 00:07:58.695\nAnd that's because the way\nthey've compiled Firefox,\n\n160\n00:07:58.695 --> 00:08:01.301\nthey've made it so that it's both.\n\n161\n00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:06.260\nThat is one executable it's actually\ncarrying the payload for 64 and 32 bit.\n\n162\n00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.520\nAnd you can run it in either mode,\nit'll default to 64 bit, right, so\n\n163\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.655\nhere's the application.\n\n164\n00:08:11.655 --> 00:08:13.460\nAnd just drag it and\ndrop it into my folder,\n\n165\n00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.280\nwhich I've already got it in there,\nso I don't need to do it twice.\n\n166\n00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.266\nAnd there it is, now if I just run it,\nit is running in the 64 bit mode,\n\n167\n00:08:21.266 --> 00:08:23.361\nso I'm in Firefox back here.\n\n168\n00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:28.660\nAnd if I hunt down wherever they've\nhidden their little About window,\n\n169\n00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.498\nit's up here, Firefox, and About.\n\n170\n00:08:31.498 --> 00:08:36.405\nI think it actually tells me, yeah, right\nthere, I'm running 52.0.1 (64-bit), right,\n\n171\n00:08:36.405 --> 00:08:40.163\nso I know that it can address the higher\namounts of memory if I need it to, right.\n\n172\n00:08:40.163 --> 00:08:45.028\nBut watch this little difference here,\nwhen I take an application and\n\n173\n00:08:45.028 --> 00:08:50.940\nI do a Get Information, right, Command I\nor Control click and choose Get Info.\n\n174\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.360\nWhen you pull up the Get Info,\nif an application is compiled for\n\n175\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.580\nboth you'll actually see some\nneat little options right here.\n\n176\n00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.360\nThat's not available for everything,\nright, if you look at some of\n\n177\n00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.260\nthe other applications I've got, like\nI've got that Dropbox application here.\n\n178\n00:09:05.636 --> 00:09:06.263\n&gt;&gt; It has it as well.\n\n179\n00:09:06.263 --> 00:09:08.423\nIt has it as well,\nit doesn't have all of it, right,\n\n180\n00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.200\nsee how over here I've\ngot Prevent App Nap.\n\n181\n00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.650\nAnd this one doesn't have App Nap,\nright, well, what the heck is App Nap?\n\n182\n00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.955\nWell, App Nap says that if an application\nis idling in the background\n\n183\n00:09:18.955 --> 00:09:22.615\nit can pause the application so\nit's not consuming battery power,\n\n184\n00:09:22.615 --> 00:09:24.155\nit's not consuming energy on your system.\n\n185\n00:09:24.155 --> 00:09:25.645\nThat's App Nap, well,\n\n186\n00:09:25.645 --> 00:09:29.160\nDropbox doesn't want to support App Nap\nbecause then it can't synchronize files.\n\n187\n00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.795\n&gt;&gt; It has to continually be running,\nright?\n\n188\n00:09:30.795 --> 00:09:34.805\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and so if we need that, we\ndon't want App Nap, but on a web browser,\n\n189\n00:09:34.805 --> 00:09:35.770\nif it's in the background,\n\n190\n00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.050\nwell what do I care if it takes the nap\nif it sleeps for a little while.\n\n191\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.631\n&gt;&gt; If I'm not using it go for\nit, right, release some of those-\n\n192\n00:09:40.631 --> 00:09:41.702\n&gt;&gt; But you can turn that off,\n\n193\n00:09:41.702 --> 00:09:44.287\nmaybe you've got some kind of\nlike calendar that you access and\n\n194\n00:09:44.287 --> 00:09:46.990\nyou wanna be able to get a notifications\nduring a calendar event.\n\n195\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.181\nWell if it's napping in the background\nthat's not gonna happen you\n\n196\n00:09:49.181 --> 00:09:49.880\ncould turn that off.\n\n197\n00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.259\nRight, so these are additional features\nthat you won't see for every application.\n\n198\n00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:56.649\nYou'll see different settings for\ndifferent ones, I've got Disk Inventory X,\n\n199\n00:09:56.649 --> 00:09:59.050\nlet's take a look at that one, here we go.\n\n200\n00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.900\nThis one doesn't give me the option\nof opening in 32-bit mode,\n\n201\n00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.112\nright, it's not compiled for both.\n\n202\n00:10:05.112 --> 00:10:09.221\nNow I don't actually know if I've got\na 32-bit or 64-bit version of it,\n\n203\n00:10:09.221 --> 00:10:12.474\nsometimes they don't give you\na great way to find out either.\n\n204\n00:10:12.474 --> 00:10:16.265\nSo when you launch the application\nsometimes they put it here in their About\n\n205\n00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:19.960\nscreen, but on this one you'll see\nwhere they're not even telling me.\n\n206\n00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.400\nNow this application, will never use more\nthan a few hundred megs of memory so,\n\n207\n00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.940\nit probably doesn't matter if it's 32 or\n64 bit.\n\n208\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.750\nBut for applications that do consume a lot\nof memory you want the 64 bit version.\n\n209\n00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.470\nNow going back to what I was saying,\n\n210\n00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:38.040\nif I launch into a 64 bit application I'm\nhaving problems I could always come in and\n\n211\n00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.750\nthrow it into 32 bit mode\nif I have the option.\n\n212\n00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.960\nAnd when you run it in 32\nbit mode you can test it and\n\n213\n00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.360\nsay do I have the same problem?\n\n214\n00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.700\nRight, so if I launch Firefox now,\nhere it comes, and\n\n215\n00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.020\nthere was a little window that\npopped up really fast there,\n\n216\n00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.050\nit didn't stay up long and\nit would've said downloading plugins.\n\n217\n00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.099\nBecause I've been running in 64 bit\nmode all this time I've never downloaded\n\n218\n00:10:58.099 --> 00:10:59.020\nthe 32 bit plugins.\n\n219\n00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.430\nIt just had to download a few right\nthere real quick, happened really fast.\n\n220\n00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.740\nBut now that it's up I can go up here to\nmy About menu and I can take a look and\n\n221\n00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.890\nFirefox is still showing\nas the 64 bit one.\n\n222\n00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.890\nBecause I've downloaded the 64 bit one,\nbut\n\n223\n00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:17.330\nI'm running in 32-bit mode because I\nchose that option when it was launched.\n\n224\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.490\nNow launched this way, it looks the same,\nit functions the same, but\n\n225\n00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:26.610\nit can't address as much memory, and\nif I had 32-bit plug-ins, they work now.\n\n226\n00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.761\nBut if I boot into 64-bit mode,\nthe 32-bit plug-ins break, right,\n\n227\n00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:31.050\nthe plug-ins have to match.\n\n228\n00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.570\nThat's one of the challenges\nthat you get when you fire up\n\n229\n00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.580\napplications in a different bit mode.\n\n230\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.880\nAnd that's why it took so long for\npeople to adopt this, today,\n\n231\n00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.740\nI can tell you that it's perfectly safe\ndownload 64-bit apps any chance you get\n\n232\n00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.550\ncuz almost everybody is moved over to it,\nthat's where you wanna be.\n\n233\n00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.896\nBut when this first rolled out, boy it was\na crap shoot, it was painful to try and\n\n234\n00:11:50.896 --> 00:11:54.430\ngo 64-bit in the first year\nafter Apple made the switch.\n\n235\n00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.540\nAnd in the second and\nthird year really can get much better, but\n\n236\n00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.780\nthen it started picking up steam because\npeople wanted more memory, right.\n\n237\n00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.810\nApple was selling laptops and\ndesktops with more and more memory, right,\n\n238\n00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.560\n16 gigs is the max on most\nlaptops these days, but\n\n239\n00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.520\non their desktops you can get 32,\n64 gigs of memory.\n\n240\n00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.900\nAnd if you're doing video editing,\nany kind of high graphics work,\n\n241\n00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.821\nyou want that extra RAM to be addressable\nand you'll want to be in 64 bit mode.\n\n242\n00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:18.902\nSo there's a big push for that.\n\n243\n00:12:18.902 --> 00:12:22.272\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don,\ntalking about applications and\n\n244\n00:12:22.272 --> 00:12:25.080\nallocating memory for these applications.\n\n245\n00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.610\nSecurity is definitely is on the minds\nof a lot of people nowadays, and\n\n246\n00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:34.115\nthat's somewhere where the Malfuzits\nout there will attempt to attack.\n\n247\n00:12:34.115 --> 00:12:37.645\nAnd, Mac does a very interesting\nthing with its application,\n\n248\n00:12:37.645 --> 00:12:38.985\nit's something called sandboxing.\n\n249\n00:12:38.985 --> 00:12:41.015\nCould you explain more about that for us?\n\n250\n00:12:41.015 --> 00:12:44.355\n&gt;&gt; All right, we have talked about\nsandboxing a few times, in this series,\n\n251\n00:12:44.355 --> 00:12:48.870\nand, I talked about, how, applications,\nwhen they run they get run kind of in this\n\n252\n00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.620\nlike walled garden where they're\nisolated from other applications.\n\n253\n00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.140\nWell it's no always like that, if I\ndownload an application from the Internet,\n\n254\n00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.610\njust from some random website, and\n\n255\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:02.010\nI install it with administrative\nprivileges, it is not sandboxed.\n\n256\n00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.690\nBut if I download the application\nfrom the App Store, then it's locked.\n\n257\n00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.480\nIt's locked up in Apple's\nlittle container and\n\n258\n00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.610\nit's isolated from all the other\napplications that are out there, right.\n\n259\n00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.190\nAnd that way [COUGH] when that application\nruns, it can't touch other apps and\n\n260\n00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.780\nother apps can't touch it.\n\n261\n00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.160\nSo if I ever download an infected\napplication by accident, or whatever,\n\n262\n00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.200\none sneaks its way into the App Store,\nit's isolated in its own little world.\n\n263\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.230\nAnd it can't infect everything else,\nit gives us nice protection and security.\n\n264\n00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:34.090\nSo that's a good feature to have right,\nand it's a reason why we might not want\n\n265\n00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.030\nto download applications from a website\nand instead download them right\n\n266\n00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.650\nfrom the app store where we know\nit's safe and they're secure.\n\n267\n00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.864\nNow all of that, everything I just said,\n\n268\n00:13:41.864 --> 00:13:43.226\nwe've talked about in\nour earlier episodes.\n\n269\n00:13:43.226 --> 00:13:47.489\nSo I didn't give you anything breaking and\nnew, but one thing that I didn't talk\n\n270\n00:13:47.489 --> 00:13:51.770\nabout was how the container affects\napplication settings, right.\n\n271\n00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.220\nWe talked in an earlier episode\nabout application preferences, and\n\n272\n00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.220\nI specifically showed you guys a folder.\n\n273\n00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.650\nLet me fire up a terminal here, and\n\n274\n00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:05.270\nI showed you /Library/Preferences.\n\n275\n00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.980\nAnd how this folder contains the global\npreferences for applications.\n\n276\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.150\nSo if there's a setting that\naffects every user of the computer,\n\n277\n00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.840\nit get's stored here.\n\n278\n00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:20.540\nBut at the same time, every user\nhas their own preferences folder,\n\n279\n00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.390\nand if I can remember\nthe name of it at least.\n\n280\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.588\nAnd so if I get into my preferences\nfolder here, there we go, so\n\n281\n00:14:27.588 --> 00:14:31.647\nit's /Users/ the user name,\n/Library/Preferences.\n\n282\n00:14:31.647 --> 00:14:34.178\nWhen you're in that folder\nyou can take a look and\n\n283\n00:14:34.178 --> 00:14:37.970\nyou'll see all the preferences\nthat pertain just to you, right.\n\n284\n00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:41.871\nAnd when I look down this application\nlist here, I'll see a bunch of stuff and\n\n285\n00:14:41.871 --> 00:14:44.346\nthese are all my\napplications I've installed.\n\n286\n00:14:44.346 --> 00:14:48.154\nI think in the earlier episode I\nwas using forklift as my example so\n\n287\n00:14:48.154 --> 00:14:51.898\nhere's com.binarynights.forklift-3.plist,\nright,\n\n288\n00:14:51.898 --> 00:14:54.617\nthat's the preferences for\nme for folklift.\n\n289\n00:14:54.617 --> 00:14:57.645\nAnd I downloaded forklift right\nfrom the developer's website, so\n\n290\n00:14:57.645 --> 00:14:59.147\nthe preferences are right here.\n\n291\n00:14:59.147 --> 00:15:03.980\nBut if it was a sandboxed app,\nan app that was isolated\n\n292\n00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.680\nfrom everybody else, the preferences\ndon't actually get stored right here.\n\n293\n00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.760\nThe preferences get stored in a container,\n\n294\n00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.990\nthe container is an isolated area just for\nthat application.\n\n295\n00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.493\nAnd the container's are actually stored\nin a different place, so right now I'm in\n\n296\n00:15:20.493 --> 00:15:25.820\n/Users/dpezet/Library/Preferences, all\nright.\n\n297\n00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.620\nThat's the old place where\napplications used to store,\n\n298\n00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.690\nit's kind of like when\na city gets a new mall.\n\n299\n00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.915\nThere's the mall that people used\nto go to and then there's the mall.\n\n300\n00:15:33.915 --> 00:15:38.010\nAnd so this is where\nthe preferences used to go, but\n\n301\n00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:42.830\nthe containerized apps will store\nit in a slightly different place.\n\n302\n00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:48.763\nYou'll have a folder that is /Users/the\nuser name/Library/Containers,\n\n303\n00:15:48.763 --> 00:15:53.908\nright, this is the isolated container\narea that a sandbox creates.\n\n304\n00:15:53.908 --> 00:15:58.269\nAnd every application that's sandboxed\nwill have their own data in here, so\n\n305\n00:15:58.269 --> 00:16:01.233\nif you take a look there'll\nbe a folder called data.\n\n306\n00:16:01.233 --> 00:16:04.675\nAnd then there will be other information\nkind of split up in here for\n\n307\n00:16:04.675 --> 00:16:06.520\neach of those applications.\n\n308\n00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.102\nAnd so looking at this list.\n\n309\n00:16:08.102 --> 00:16:09.390\nHang on.\n\n310\n00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:12.920\nMy screen is getting a little messy here,\nso let's re pull that up.\n\n311\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.750\nThere we go.\n\n312\n00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.170\nSo looking at this list,\nI see all these different applications.\n\n313\n00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.420\nAnd notice how most of it's com.apple,\n\n314\n00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.820\nbecause Apple has made sure to\ncontainerize all of their applications.\n\n315\n00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.270\nSo starting up here at the top,\nI've got Microsoft OSF web host.\n\n316\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.750\nWhat the heck is that?\n\n317\n00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.210\nI don't know what it stands for.\n\n318\n00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.810\nSo anyway, some Microsoft product\nthat I've apparently installed.\n\n319\n00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.560\nAnd then I've got a whole list of Apple.\n\n320\n00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.126\nAll the Apple sand box stuff.\n\n321\n00:16:36.126 --> 00:16:38.980\nAnd then I start getting\ninto the third party things.\n\n322\n00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:43.031\nAnd I'll see a black magic application\nthat I installed from the app store.\n\n323\n00:16:43.031 --> 00:16:46.780\nI got a couple of things like Mark Ed,\nI purchased from the app store.\n\n324\n00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.869\nSerial, I purchased from the app store.\n\n325\n00:16:48.869 --> 00:16:51.977\nLast pass, actually I don't know if\nI pulled that from the app store.\n\n326\n00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:52.976\nI more than likely did.\n\n327\n00:16:52.976 --> 00:16:56.030\nExcel, Office, Outlook, PowerPoint,\nI got those from Microsoft.\n\n328\n00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.000\nThese are all ones that\nhad been containerized.\n\n329\n00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.870\nThey're isolated.\n\n330\n00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.900\nThey're protected.\n\n331\n00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:05.990\nAnd these spaces in here are only allowed\nto be accessed by those applications.\n\n332\n00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.960\nSo if you're ever troubleshooting\nan application, and\n\n333\n00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.100\nyou clear out its preferences.\n\n334\n00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.110\nAnd then you fire up the app, and\nit's still got all its settings, and\n\n335\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:13.540\nyou're like what the heck is going on?\n\n336\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.560\nWhat are these?\n\n337\n00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.424\nIt might be that the preferences\nhave been stored in a container.\n\n338\n00:17:17.424 --> 00:17:20.866\nSo I wanted to highlight that is another\nvariation that you might have on apps.\n\n339\n00:17:20.866 --> 00:17:22.543\n64-bit versus 32-bit apps, and\n\n340\n00:17:22.543 --> 00:17:24.940\nthen containerized versus\nnon-containerized apps.\n\n341\n00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.977\nThe old way of storing things and\nthe new way of storing things.\n\n342\n00:17:27.977 --> 00:17:31.672\nSo we definitely need to be aware of that,\nespecially when you're trying to reset\n\n343\n00:17:31.672 --> 00:17:35.380\nan application back to default, you're\ntrying to hunt down those preferences.\n\n344\n00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.192\nIt could be in either place.\n\n345\n00:17:36.192 --> 00:17:37.875\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's always a fun time, right?\n\n346\n00:17:37.875 --> 00:17:39.890\nYou're like a detective over there,\n\n347\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.460\nlooking through your file system\ngoing where is this found?\n\n348\n00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.120\nAnd now, well, we have a pretty good\nidea where that might be laying now.\n\n349\n00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.379\nNow that being said, if you're\nworking at any kind of help desk with\n\n350\n00:17:49.379 --> 00:17:53.270\nsupporting applications, people\nare going talk to you, or even yourself.\n\n351\n00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.190\nYou're having trouble.\n\n352\n00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:59.050\nI need to be able to see what\nis running on my computer.\n\n353\n00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.100\nNow I come from a heavy\nWindows background, so\n\n354\n00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.540\nI know where to go to\nget the Task Manager.\n\n355\n00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.800\nI am assuming, and\n\n356\n00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.620\nI actually pretty much know, they have\nequivalence of that inside of MacOS.\n\n357\n00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.810\nWhere can we find that?\n\n358\n00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.270\nWhat is that called?\n\n359\n00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, so thinking about\napplications that are not behaving nicely.\n\n360\n00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:20.430\nSo a user calls you up on the phone and\nthey say, my computer is so slow.\n\n361\n00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.890\nI hate this piece of junk.\n\n362\n00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:22.460\n&gt;&gt; But it's a Mac.\n\n363\n00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.893\nIt doesn't do that.\n\n364\n00:18:23.893 --> 00:18:24.776\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's magic.\n\n365\n00:18:24.776 --> 00:18:25.790\nIt just works.\n\n366\n00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:30.824\nSometimes it just works slowly,\nso we just need to find out why.\n\n367\n00:18:30.824 --> 00:18:33.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is great,\n\n368\n00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.540\nwe need to cut that out somewhere.\n\n369\n00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.030\n&gt;&gt; I pitch this commercial to Apple.\n\n370\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.485\nThey rejected it.\n\n371\n00:18:38.485 --> 00:18:43.490\n[LAUGH] But on a serious note though,\nwhen you run a lot of applications,\n\n372\n00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.950\nand you start loading it up with things,\neventually it does get slow, and\n\n373\n00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:46.630\nwe need to find out why.\n\n374\n00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.580\nAnd we need some kind of way to view it.\n\n375\n00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.430\nAnd I'll use Firefox here as an example.\n\n376\n00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:54.830\nSo I've got Firefox pulled up, and maybe\nI'll open up some web pages like CNN.com.\n\n377\n00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.190\nAnd we'll go fair and balanced, get\nsome Foxnews.com, which I spelled wrong.\n\n378\n00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:59.560\nIt's probably going to be porno.\n\n379\n00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.440\nNope, all right.\n\n380\n00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:00.968\nGood, redirected.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n381\n00:19:00.968 --> 00:19:01.478\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:19:01.478 --> 00:19:02.417\n&gt;&gt; Got to love it when they buy\n\n383\n00:19:02.417 --> 00:19:05.128\nall the domains that you could misspell.\n&gt;&gt; It's one letter off, and all of\n\n384\n00:19:05.128 --> 00:19:10.203\na sudden, you got to refilm an episode.\n[LAUGH] So maybe we could give Reuters,\n\n385\n00:19:10.203 --> 00:19:12.485\nwe'll try to go\ninternational a little bit.\n\n386\n00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:13.330\nSome Pravda.\n\n387\n00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:17.835\n[LAUGH] So we are trying to\ndiversify our information sources.\n\n388\n00:19:17.835 --> 00:19:22.755\nSo each tab that I am launching here\nis getting information and loading it.\n\n389\n00:19:22.755 --> 00:19:24.785\nIt's got picture and\nanimation and advertisements.\n\n390\n00:19:24.785 --> 00:19:25.705\nIt all consumes memory.\n\n391\n00:19:25.705 --> 00:19:27.215\nIt all consumes CPU.\n\n392\n00:19:27.215 --> 00:19:28.700\nIt's affecting my system.\n\n393\n00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.360\nAnd the more and more that I launch,\n\n394\n00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.500\nthe more applications that I run, the more\nthat it's going start to burden me down.\n\n395\n00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.600\nSo as I launch Word and\nExcel, if I sign up for\n\n396\n00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.090\na newsletter, if I launch Garage Band,\nwhich I may or may not have installed.\n\n397\n00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:44.850\nApparently I don't.\n\n398\n00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.445\nIf I launch whatever, as I launch these,\n\n399\n00:19:46.445 --> 00:19:49.170\nthese applications are consuming\nmemory and resources.\n\n400\n00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.880\nWell, on a Mac, you have what's\ncalled the Activity Monitor, and\n\n401\n00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.030\nthe Activity Monitor is awesome.\n\n402\n00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.370\nFor a troubleshooter,\n\n403\n00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.880\nit gives you a full view of exactly\nwhat's going on in your system.\n\n404\n00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.840\nAnd it's tucked away under the Utilities\nfolder under Applications.\n\n405\n00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:07.460\nSo if you were to browse to it, you could\nfire up your Finder, go to Applications,\n\n406\n00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.930\nand buried in here,\nyou'll find the Utilities folder.\n\n407\n00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.260\nIt's in here somewhere.\n\n408\n00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.050\nAnd once you get into that utility folder,\n\n409\n00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.420\nwhich finding it is apparently\nthe hard part for me.\n\n410\n00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.330\nThere it is, and inside the Utilities,\nyou'll find the Activity Monitor.\n\n411\n00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.932\nNow, I have a hard time finding it that\nway because I never launch it that way.\n\n412\n00:20:20.932 --> 00:20:23.283\nI always just pull up my Spotlight and\ntype in activity.\n\n413\n00:20:23.283 --> 00:20:24.798\nIt's the first thing that comes up.\n\n414\n00:20:24.798 --> 00:20:28.960\nAnd so you can launch the Activity\nMonitor, and it starts off by giving you\n\n415\n00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.940\na view of all of the applications\nthat are running on your system.\n\n416\n00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.990\nThese are ones that are in\nthe foreground that you can see, and\n\n417\n00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.810\nones that are in the background\nthat are hidden from you.\n\n418\n00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:43.500\nAnd you can see which ones\nare consuming resources on your system.\n\n419\n00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:50.100\nAnd it breaks it up by CPU,\nmemory, energy, disk, and network.\n\n420\n00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.680\nNow, if you've done troubleshooting,\nwhen it comes to performance,\n\n421\n00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.040\nyou know there's what we call,\nthe big four, right?\n\n422\n00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.920\nCPU, memory, network, disk, those four.\n\n423\n00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.470\nEnergy really only matters on laptops.\n\n424\n00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.340\nWe have battery power.\n\n425\n00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.590\nSo, who's eating up all my battery life?\n\n426\n00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.315\nSomebody calls up and says, hey,\nI used to get ten hours on my battery.\n\n427\n00:21:07.315 --> 00:21:08.260\nNow I get two hours.\n\n428\n00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:08.850\nWhat's going on?\n\n429\n00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.040\nWhat's up?\n\n430\n00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:10.720\nI can come in here and\n\n431\n00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.340\nI can pull up the applications\nlisted by their energy impact.\n\n432\n00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.410\nWho's hurting me the most for\npower right now?\n\n433\n00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:21.620\nI can see that Time Machine is hurting\nme the most when it's doing back ups.\n\n434\n00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.990\nIt's writing to a disk.\n\n435\n00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.440\nIt's consuming the most\nenergy on the system.\n\n436\n00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.710\nAfter that I've got Drop Box,\n\n437\n00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.280\nwhich is constantly synchronizing\nmy files, and so that one's next.\n\n438\n00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.760\nAnd I can see who it is that's\nresponsible for that battery degradation.\n\n439\n00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.640\nBut if somebody calls and says,\nhey, my computer's running slow.\n\n440\n00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.350\nWell, that's where we can pull\nup our CPU and our memory.\n\n441\n00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.550\nAnd those are usually the two\nbig spots that we have our hit.\n\n442\n00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.650\nYou have a processor in your system.\n\n443\n00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.290\nIt's probably multi-core, hopefully.\n\n444\n00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.500\nI think every Mac that's\nsold today is multi-core.\n\n445\n00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.280\nWell, that means you can do\nmore than one thing at once.\n\n446\n00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:50.860\nThat's awesome.\n\n447\n00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.150\nBut there's only so\nmuch a computer can do at any given time.\n\n448\n00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.050\nAnd so when you come in here,\n\n449\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.890\nyou can look at the percentage of CPU\nthat your applications are consuming.\n\n450\n00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.740\nAnd I can see right now,\ngood old Firefox is running at 119%.\n\n451\n00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.140\nHow is that possible?\n\n452\n00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.270\nWell, I've got an I7.\n\n453\n00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.695\nI7 has four cores.\n\n454\n00:22:08.695 --> 00:22:11.778\nAnd technically, it does hyper-threading.\n\n455\n00:22:11.778 --> 00:22:15.790\nHyper-threading, is that the right word?\n\n456\n00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.186\nHyper-threading, yes, hyper-threading.\n\n457\n00:22:17.186 --> 00:22:18.195\nAll right, hyper-threading.\n\n458\n00:22:18.195 --> 00:22:22.252\n[CROSSTALK] Where if it has empty space\ninside of a core, it can create like\n\n459\n00:22:22.252 --> 00:22:25.992\na fake core, so it can have up to\neight cores in certain scenarios.\n\n460\n00:22:25.992 --> 00:22:27.240\nThis doesn't normally happen.\n\n461\n00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.080\nSo, let's just say it has four cores.\n\n462\n00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:33.722\nThat means I can get up to 400%, before my\nlaptop actually slowed to a crawl because\n\n463\n00:22:33.722 --> 00:22:35.640\nI've got multiple cores for that.\n\n464\n00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.029\nBut that's why we saw Firefox at 119%,\nyou might freak out.\n\n465\n00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:40.880\nBut don't, because that's fine.\n\n466\n00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.960\nThat means there's two more\ncores I haven't even touched.\n\n467\n00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.149\nI used the 100% of one core,\n20% of another core.\n\n468\n00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:48.910\nCore 3, Core 4,\nsitting there doing nothing.\n\n469\n00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.750\nSo we don't have to sweat that so much.\n\n470\n00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.500\nI can see that Firefox though,\nthe web content and\n\n471\n00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.960\nthe browser itself are both consuming\na pretty decent amount of CPU.\n\n472\n00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.980\nAnd what's it doing right now?\n\n473\n00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.410\nSitting there in the background.\n\n474\n00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.990\nNot a terribly efficient web\nbrowser as far as browsers go.\n\n475\n00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.190\nIt's actually one of the worst.\n\n476\n00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:09.570\nIt's a good browser as\nfar as the performance.\n\n477\n00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:10.590\nAnd you'll run into that.\n\n478\n00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.690\nSo a user calls and\ntells you, my laptop is slow.\n\n479\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.920\nI hate this thing.\n\n480\n00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.280\nWell, it's not the laptop's fault.\n\n481\n00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.550\nIt's not Mac OS's fault.\n\n482\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:17.710\nIt's usually an application.\n\n483\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.610\nAnd here we can find out and\nfigure out which one it is.\n\n484\n00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.055\nAnd you can take a look at CPU time,\n\n485\n00:23:22.055 --> 00:23:25.370\nbecause you might have an application\nthat's not doing so much right now.\n\n486\n00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:28.280\nBut when you sort by CPU time, you find\nthere's one that's been doing something\n\n487\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.700\nover a period of days or whatever, so\ncausing impact to different areas, and\n\n488\n00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.310\nyou can start to spot some of that.\n\n489\n00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:37.800\nRight now Kernel Task and Windows Server,\nthose are two really important tasks.\n\n490\n00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.430\nThe Kernel is actually\nwhat runs your computer.\n\n491\n00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.860\nIt's what makes everything work.\n\n492\n00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.300\nIt's the heart of Mac OS.\n\n493\n00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.115\nSo, that's your computer working.\n\n494\n00:23:46.115 --> 00:23:47.610\n[LAUGH] You expect to see that one.\n\n495\n00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.112\n&gt;&gt; You wouldn't want to kill that task.\n\n496\n00:23:49.112 --> 00:23:50.841\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n497\n00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:54.770\nNow, my computer has been running for\nquite some time.\n\n498\n00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.508\nThis is basically seconds, minutes, hours.\n\n499\n00:23:57.508 --> 00:23:59.165\nSo, two hours and 40 minutes.\n\n500\n00:23:59.165 --> 00:24:03.771\nAnd my Kernel time is usually going\nto reflect the up time of the device.\n\n501\n00:24:03.771 --> 00:24:04.824\nSo you'll see that,\n\n502\n00:24:04.824 --> 00:24:08.394\nthe Window Server, well that's not\ntalking about Microsoft Windows,\n\n503\n00:24:08.394 --> 00:24:12.332\nit's talking about the windows here in\nmy application, like this is a Window.\n\n504\n00:24:12.332 --> 00:24:15.586\nSomething had to render this Window on\nmy screen to make it independent, so\n\n505\n00:24:15.586 --> 00:24:17.560\nI can move it around like this, right?\n\n506\n00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.210\nOtherwise everything will be full screen\nand that only be one app at a time.\n\n507\n00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:23.310\nA window manager is what\ngives me this capability.\n\n508\n00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:26.910\nSo that's running all the time,\nto you expect to see those really high.\n\n509\n00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:31.170\nAfter that,\neverything else should be fairly low.\n\n510\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.880\nWe shouldn't see any huge spikes and\nI don't.\n\n511\n00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.580\nMost of my stuff is pretty reasonable,\n\n512\n00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.170\nwith the exception of good\nold Firefox down there.\n\n513\n00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:41.560\nSo that's a good way to see CPU,\nyou've also got memory.\n\n514\n00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.050\nYou who's eating up my memory?\n\n515\n00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.610\nI've got 16 gigs of RAM on my computer,\nif I run out of that,\n\n516\n00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.260\nit starts paging to disk.\n\n517\n00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.200\nAnd disk is slow.\n\n518\n00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.160\nEven with SSD, it's slower than RAM.\n\n519\n00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.190\nSo, who's eating up all my memory?\n\n520\n00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.680\nWell, kernel, I'll allow that.\n\n521\n00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.510\nBut then I've got Firefox, firefox is\neating over a gig of memory right now.\n\n522\n00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.860\nIf I combine these two entries here.\n\n523\n00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.556\nOver a gig of memory to\ndisplay five crappy web pages.\n\n524\n00:25:02.556 --> 00:25:05.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And that's a testament to how\n\n525\n00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.670\nmany advertisements and\n\n526\n00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.340\nanimations of other things\nare embedded in web pages these days.\n\n527\n00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.940\nThat's a lot of work for them, dropbox.\n\n528\n00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:15.170\n223 megs of memory just to index my files.\n\n529\n00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.510\nThe more files I have the bigger\nthat index is going to be so\n\n530\n00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.380\nhere's where we can get an idea\nof what's eating up our memory.\n\n531\n00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.790\nDisk, if you have SSD your\ndisk is pretty darn fast.\n\n532\n00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.940\nAnd so\nusually it's not gonna be a problem, but\n\n533\n00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.650\nif you've still got a spinning disk.\n\n534\n00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.680\nThe more applications that\nare hitting the disk,\n\n535\n00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.310\nthe slower your computer is gonna get.\n\n536\n00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:36.590\nAnd you come in here and\nsee who is generating the most writes or\n\n537\n00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.380\nthe most reads, right?\n\n538\n00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.750\nA read can be cached,\nyou can cache a read.\n\n539\n00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.830\nSomebody reads off a sector of\nthe hard drive, it gets cached.\n\n540\n00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.370\nThe next first to reads reads\nit out to RAM, it's much faster.\n\n541\n00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:50.290\nOr write cannot be cached, a write\nalways requires access to the disk.\n\n542\n00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.610\nSo we usually pay attention to the writes\nand say, who's generating the most writes?\n\n543\n00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.930\nAnd figure out who it is that's\nconsuming those resources.\n\n544\n00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.860\nNow here got the mds_stores which is\na part of the operating system, so\n\n545\n00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.320\nI expect that to be high,\n\n546\n00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.460\nlaunchd, that's the launch daemon that\nactually makes your computer start up.\n\n547\n00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.050\nAgain kind of an important one.\n\n548\n00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.850\nThat is technically the first application\nrun when your computer boots up.\n\n549\n00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.980\nThe kernel launches and it immediately\nturns around and launches launchd.\n\n550\n00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.202\nAnd so if you look over here,\nthe process ID 1.\n\n551\n00:26:16.202 --> 00:26:18.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the first one,\n\n552\n00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.630\nyou've got kernel task, 0, right?\n\n553\n00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:24.020\nThat's the beginning and\nthen it launches launchd.\n\n554\n00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.310\n&gt;&gt; I see Dropbox is definitely\nthe top of the not system stuff list.\n\n555\n00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it's synchronizing\nmy files and writing to disk, so\n\n556\n00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.270\nevery time I change something on my other\ncomputers it synchronizes here like a good\n\n557\n00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:36.036\nIT person I have 20 computers or\nsomething ridiculous like that.\n\n558\n00:26:36.036 --> 00:26:36.612\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n559\n00:26:36.612 --> 00:26:40.960\n&gt;&gt; So it's gonna write that back there and\nit is generating disk activity, so\n\n560\n00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.220\nthat it can affect you.\n\n561\n00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.090\nAnd then lastly networking,\nnetworks are important.\n\n562\n00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.520\nTypically we have way more local\nbandwidth than we do internet bandwidth.\n\n563\n00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.180\nSo like here in the building\nwe've got a Gigabit network.\n\n564\n00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.280\n&gt;&gt; But\nour Internet connection is 200 megabit.\n\n565\n00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.810\nSo I might be able to handle 500\nmegabit of traffic here no problem, but\n\n566\n00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:58.480\nnot to the Internet.\n\n567\n00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.680\nSo I have a bottleneck,\nthe bottleneck is usually somewhere else.\n\n568\n00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.720\nBut if the bottleneck were here,\nI could usually see it and\n\n569\n00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.020\nfigure out who it is that's\nconsuming most of the resources.\n\n570\n00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:10.120\nI can see that I've got my network file\nsystem manager here it's consuming\n\n571\n00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.310\na good bit.\n\n572\n00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:14.830\nI've got a postgres database,\nwhich I can't remember starting.\n\n573\n00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:16.410\nSo I need to find out\nwhy I'm running that.,\n\n574\n00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.230\n&gt;&gt; That's that malware\n\n575\n00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.963\nrunning in the background.\n\n576\n00:27:17.963 --> 00:27:19.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I have started some\n\n577\n00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:20.390\nvarious things.\n\n578\n00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:24.560\nI'm running the OS 10 server on my laptop,\nand it has a postgres database in it.\n\n579\n00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.660\nSo I probably fired it up in\nopen directory or something and\n\n580\n00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.740\nit's got kind of going\nrunning in the background.\n\n581\n00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.990\nBut I can see it there and it's consuming\na very small amount of network you have.\n\n582\n00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.070\nBut it is consuming\nthe network resources and\n\n583\n00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.360\nthat there maybe something\nthat I need to look into.\n\n584\n00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.060\nAnd the you'll see the other\nthings that are all consuming\n\n585\n00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.370\nnetwork resources as well.\n\n586\n00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:45.330\nAll right, now the activity\nmanner is not just for show.\n\n587\n00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.290\nRight, I mean it certainly does the show\npart pretty well like down here at\n\n588\n00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:49.750\nthe bottom you get some nice old grasp and\n\n589\n00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:53.250\nyou kind of see how your system is\ndoing at any given time and so on.\n\n590\n00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:54.980\nThat's nice right?\n\n591\n00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.580\nBut you can also take actions here.\n\n592\n00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.140\nSo say I get mad at Firefox, firefox is\nfrozen and it's just not responding, but\n\n593\n00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.860\nhere it is consuming all these\nresources and now I'm frustrated.\n\n594\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.460\nWell you can highlight any\napplication in here, and\n\n595\n00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:11.020\nup top you'll see where you've\ngot this--- Stop sign with an X.\n\n596\n00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.230\nYou owe me to get the information\nbutton too which is nice,\n\n597\n00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.510\nyou see some information\nabout that process.\n\n598\n00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:19.660\nIt shows you like files of that process\nis holding open, apparently there's none.\n\n599\n00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.250\nYou get some other statistics and\nmemory, that's all cool but\n\n600\n00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.810\nthat really is just for show.\n\n601\n00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:27.350\nBut then I can choose the application and\nI can hit the stop button.\n\n602\n00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:30.980\nAnd that will do is called force quitting,\nI force quit the application and\n\n603\n00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:31.510\nterminate it.\n\n604\n00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:36.130\nSo that's kind of knock that out and let\nme recover the memory and CPU and so on,\n\n605\n00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.170\nthat's consuming.\n\n606\n00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:40.560\nNow, be careful, because sometimes\none application is linked to another.\n\n607\n00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.120\nLike here,\nthe web content is linked to Firefox.\n\n608\n00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.400\nSo, when you kill one application,\nit might kill others along with it.\n\n609\n00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.060\nSo, you always want to make\nsure you're careful about that.\n\n610\n00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.760\nIf you kill something really critical,\nit could break other things and\n\n611\n00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.390\nnow you need to reboot your computer\nbefore you get it all straight again,\n\n612\n00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:55.958\nwhich we usually want to avoid.\n\n613\n00:28:55.958 --> 00:28:59.350\nAll right, and if you highlight\nsomething like Firefox and\n\n614\n00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.170\nhit the Stop button,\nit's just gonna say hey do you wanna Quit,\n\n615\n00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:05.770\nwhich is a graceful quit, that would be\nthe same thing as if I went to Firefox,\n\n616\n00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:09.530\nand went to the Firefox menu and\nhit Quit, or clicked the little x.\n\n617\n00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:13.790\nOr I could force quit, if it's frozen,\nit's not gonna respond to a Quit, so\n\n618\n00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:14.820\nI need to force quit it.\n\n619\n00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.040\nThis uses the Unix side of\nthings to kill the process.\n\n620\n00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.490\nAnd when it kills it, it's gonna kill\nthat process and anything tied to it.\n\n621\n00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.360\nSo see how I killed Firefox?\n\n622\n00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.610\nBut the Firefox web content went with it,\nright, they were tied together.\n\n623\n00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:31.040\nIt's gone and I just recovered the memory\nand other resources that it was eating.\n\n624\n00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.390\nAnd if you watch my little\nCPU chart down here,\n\n625\n00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:37.900\nyou'll see it takes that dip\nWhich was me freeing up Firefox.\n\n626\n00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.400\nMemory should have shown a bigger dip\n\n627\n00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.840\nbecause Firefox was\nconsuming a gig of memory.\n\n628\n00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.720\nIt is kind of hard to see there,\nthe green line does dip\n\n629\n00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.920\ndown a bit there where it was terminated\nand I freed up that giga memory.\n\n630\n00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.830\nSo, that's something we can do\nfrom writing to false credit.\n\n631\n00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:57.910\nThere's other ways to force quit things\nfor example if it has a dark icon down\n\n632\n00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.620\nhere and it's running so\nmaybe I've got a clued iPad up and going.\n\n633\n00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:08.790\nWhen you control click on an icon\nhere in the doc you'll see quit and\n\n634\n00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.240\ngracefully quit out of it.\n\n635\n00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.430\nAnd if you hold your option key see how\nit changes from quit to force quit?\n\n636\n00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:20.220\nSo I can right click or control click on\nthe dock icon, hold option and choose\n\n637\n00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.280\nforce quit and that will do the same thing\nas well I did for the activity monitors.\n\n638\n00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.450\nThat's another way to kind\nof achieve the same goal.\n\n639\n00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.220\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, I've worked on helpdesk for\nmany many years.\n\n640\n00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.850\nOne of my favorite things is\nwhen a user calls and says.\n\n641\n00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:35.410\nI had an error pop up and I clicked OK.\n\n642\n00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:36.290\nWell, what did the error say?\n\n643\n00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:36.880\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n644\n00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.200\n&gt;&gt; But there's something wrong with\n\n645\n00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.170\nmy computer now.\n\n646\n00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.770\nAnd then I have to go look at the logs.\n\n647\n00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:45.020\nI assumed that MacBook also has\nsome sort of logging and reporting.\n\n648\n00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.980\nHave to send this information to\nApple sometimes to try to get to\n\n649\n00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:48.635\nthe bottom of the issue.\n\n650\n00:30:48.635 --> 00:30:53.470\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, typically when\nan application crashes, it tries to\n\n651\n00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:55.790\nlog some information to let you know what\nhappened because otherwise it crashes and\n\n652\n00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.335\nyou launch it back up and\neverything's fine.\n\n653\n00:30:57.335 --> 00:30:59.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; How do you fix the problem?\n\n654\n00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.340\nIt's gone or maybe a problem happened over\nnight or maybe there's a problem happening\n\n655\n00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.650\nright now and\nyou just don't even know about it, right?\n\n656\n00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.395\nWhen you need to access\nthe logs in the system.\n\n657\n00:31:06.395 --> 00:31:09.600\nAnd there's another utility which you\ncan get to by going to applications,\n\n658\n00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.140\nand utilities, but\nIt's called the console.\n\n659\n00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.080\nI usually launch it through the spotlight,\nso if I launch Spotlight and\n\n660\n00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.410\ntype console,\nit will launch the console application.\n\n661\n00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:24.400\nWhat the console application lets us do,\nis view the logs of our system and so\n\n662\n00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.730\nwhen I click on the default is that\nit's bring me up the full logs, but\n\n663\n00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.370\nyou see over here we can actually\nkind of filter things a bit.\n\n664\n00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:33.920\nYou can look at the logs for your user\naccount, you can look at the logs for\n\n665\n00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.370\nthe system and you can look at\nthe logs for Unix under the hood.\n\n666\n00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:41.560\nWhat I'm looking at here we have devices\nchosen is actually all three of them in\n\n667\n00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.740\none place, I'm seeing the full logs which\ncan be a little overwhelming sometimes\n\n668\n00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.940\neven just while I'm talking you'll see\nlog messages popping up here, right?\n\n669\n00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.530\nSome kind of connections canceling and\nbeing destroyed and whatever.\n\n670\n00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:58.004\nSounds really bad, but it isn't, it's just\nnormal stuff that's kinda running and\n\n671\n00:31:58.004 --> 00:31:58.947\ndoing its thing.\n\n672\n00:31:58.947 --> 00:32:02.879\nThis is parsecd, which is part\nof a network service that I use.\n\n673\n00:32:02.879 --> 00:32:05.893\nAnd it's just trying to connect to\na server and failing, right, and so\n\n674\n00:32:05.893 --> 00:32:07.714\nit's just not Getting out to that server.\n\n675\n00:32:07.714 --> 00:32:10.351\nYou'll see other things,\nthough that might actually be serious.\n\n676\n00:32:10.351 --> 00:32:12.570\nThere might be problems\nthat we need to deal with.\n\n677\n00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:16.750\nWe've got some kind of security exception\nhere, but it's not telling me what it is.\n\n678\n00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.670\nSometimes, it's not terribly helpful,\nright?\n\n679\n00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.990\nAnd you can choose details, and maybe\nyou'll get a little more information, but\n\n680\n00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:24.410\nhere it's telling me I've got some kind\nof security exception, which is more than\n\n681\n00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:27.820\nlikely an application tried to do\nsomething it wasn't allowed to do.\n\n682\n00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:32.000\nLike an application tried to access\nsomething outside of its sandbox, and\n\n683\n00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.680\nit was blocked, right?\n\n684\n00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.850\nIt was good that it was blocked, but\n\n685\n00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:35.910\nit's not really giving me\nany information to act on.\n\n686\n00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:39.120\nSo sometimes you can't act on this stuff,\nbut sometimes you can.\n\n687\n00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.585\nIf I'm having problems with Forklift,\nI can come in here and\n\n688\n00:32:42.585 --> 00:32:46.315\nI can search the logs and\nI can just look for Forklift.\n\n689\n00:32:46.315 --> 00:32:49.945\nAnd it'll scan through and show me any\nlogs that have the keyword forklift in it.\n\n690\n00:32:49.945 --> 00:32:51.575\nAnd, well, apparently I don't have any.\n\n691\n00:32:51.575 --> 00:32:52.339\nSo maybe not a good example.\n\n692\n00:32:52.339 --> 00:32:53.635\n&gt;&gt; Maybe Firefox.\n\n693\n00:32:53.635 --> 00:32:56.285\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, Firefox,\nwe did just crash that one.\n\n694\n00:32:56.285 --> 00:32:58.908\nIt's not turning up.\n\n695\n00:32:58.908 --> 00:32:59.605\nIt's not under Mozilla either.\n\n696\n00:32:59.605 --> 00:33:01.545\nSometimes the hardest part is-\n&gt;&gt; What it is, yeah.\n\n697\n00:33:01.545 --> 00:33:02.825\n&gt;&gt; Figuring out what\nyou need to search for.\n\n698\n00:33:02.825 --> 00:33:04.871\nYeah, so we can come through and\nlook for that.\n\n699\n00:33:04.871 --> 00:33:07.521\nThere's other things that you\ncan pull up in here too, though,\n\n700\n00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:10.480\nlike this straight up system log where\nyou see it kind of in a raw format.\n\n701\n00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.400\nAnd if I don't know what I'm looking for,\nthis is where I normally come.\n\n702\n00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.397\nYou can go into the system log and\nnow you can kind of browse through and\n\n703\n00:33:16.397 --> 00:33:18.220\nyou see how you get\nthe giant wall of text.\n\n704\n00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:22.658\nBut it kind of helps you to spot what\nyou're looking for and a lot of times you\n\n705\n00:33:22.658 --> 00:33:27.382\ncan find things that have crashed or\ngenerated an error message of some sought,\n\n706\n00:33:27.382 --> 00:33:30.630\nand you can sort of figure\nout what's going on.\n\n707\n00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:31.470\nLooking through here,\n\n708\n00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:35.380\nactually I see my Splashtop streamer\nis throwing a bunch of messages.\n\n709\n00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:39.760\nThese aren't errors, they're just\nmessages that certain events happened\n\n710\n00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.820\nthat it took some action and\nsomething happened.\n\n711\n00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:47.230\nHere it's saying this end point has been\nactivated through Legacy Launch APIs.\n\n712\n00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:51.240\nSo the developments application has\nimported something over to a newer API.\n\n713\n00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.466\nThe old API still works, this isn't\nan error, but it's a message telling me,\n\n714\n00:33:54.466 --> 00:33:56.168\nhey the future of this isn't gonna work.\n\n715\n00:33:56.168 --> 00:33:59.714\nSo if I'm the developer, I know, hey,\nI need to go in, and update this,\n\n716\n00:33:59.714 --> 00:34:00.690\nand fix it.\n\n717\n00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.710\nSo you can find things like that as\nyou dig through these reports, and\n\n718\n00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.710\neach one is kind of filtered\nin a different way.\n\n719\n00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:09.853\nOn the left side, if you look at\nsystem reports or user reports,\n\n720\n00:34:09.853 --> 00:34:13.480\nit's breaking things down\nbased on certain criteria.\n\n721\n00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.069\nAnd so here it looks like I've had\na crash log under my user reports,\n\n722\n00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:18.030\nsomething crashed,\nlet's figure out what it is.\n\n723\n00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:22.730\nIt says, it just says a plug in container.\n\n724\n00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.350\nIt's actually not telling me which\napplication it is that crashed,\n\n725\n00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:26.310\nwhich is useful.\n\n726\n00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.820\nIf it doesn't tell you the application\na lot of times that means\n\n727\n00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.870\nit's the operating system.\n\n728\n00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:33.020\nBut, no,\nin this case it's a Firefox plugin.\n\n729\n00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:36.180\nI can see right here I've got a path and\nin the path it's\n\n730\n00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:40.324\n/application/Firefox.app/Content MacOS\nplugin-conatiner.\n\n731\n00:34:40.324 --> 00:34:44.707\nAnd so if I keep drilling down here\nI can figure out that it's the actual\n\n732\n00:34:44.707 --> 00:34:49.120\nplugin container, the plugin\nsubsystem of Firefox is what crashed.\n\n733\n00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.280\nWell, remember I booted it\nin 32-bit mode a minute ago?\n\n734\n00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.490\nThis is probably when it started up in\n32-bit mode and it didn't have a plugin,\n\n735\n00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:57.260\nso it had to download them.\n\n736\n00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.230\nSo, it probably crashed, downloaded\nthen re-launched, but if it didn't,\n\n737\n00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:04.265\nI could use this to start troubleshooting\nand finding out what's going on.\n\n738\n00:35:04.265 --> 00:35:07.535\nAnd actually it's telling me here\nthe code type is X86-64 (Native) so\n\n739\n00:35:07.535 --> 00:35:11.145\nthat means it was when I was running\n64 bit mode that it crashed.\n\n740\n00:35:11.145 --> 00:35:15.035\nSo maybe this was after I launched it\nback into 64 bit mode, after 32 bit mode.\n\n741\n00:35:15.035 --> 00:35:18.415\nBut you can find information here,\nidentify what crashed,\n\n742\n00:35:18.415 --> 00:35:20.445\nwhat it was accessing when it crashed.\n\n743\n00:35:20.445 --> 00:35:23.380\nAnd some of this information might not\nmean anything to you, but if you're on\n\n744\n00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.820\nthe phone with Apple tech support they\nmight ask you to send them this log.\n\n745\n00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.790\nAnd so you can send it over to them,\nyou can just copy and\n\n746\n00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.250\npaste right here into an email.\n\n747\n00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.390\nAnd send it over to them and it's\na great way to share that with them so\n\n748\n00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:36.890\nthey can view it and\nget access to that information.\n\n749\n00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:40.620\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, if you're working on any kind\nof support capacity this is definitely\n\n750\n00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:44.410\nsome of the best information you can have\nbecause you're probably gonna spend a lot\n\n751\n00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:47.440\nof time in this area troubleshooting\nissues with applications.\n\n752\n00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.568\nLike we said, things that get hung up,\nthey're not working,\n\n753\n00:35:49.568 --> 00:35:50.930\nyou need to be able to quit them.\n\n754\n00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:52.470\nWhat is it that is hung up?\n\n755\n00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:55.290\nHow much memory and\nresources are being utilized?\n\n756\n00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.110\nMaybe they're being over\nutilized by something,\n\n757\n00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.060\nwe need to address those things.\n\n758\n00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.750\nAnd then ultimately, if there's an error,\nwe can look into log system and\n\n759\n00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:05.510\nget that information to\nthe correct person to help\n\n760\n00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.780\nfix whatever is ailing\nyour poor Mac machine.\n\n761\n00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:09.420\nDon, that make sense?\n\n762\n00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.236\nIs there anything else we can add to\nthis episode before we close it down\n\n763\n00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:12.770\nfor the day?\n\n764\n00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:15.410\n&gt;&gt; The only thing I can think of\nis that there are a lot of filters\n\n765\n00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:16.640\nin the console application.\n\n766\n00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.170\nSo do know that, if you navigate\nin the menus there's a few things,\n\n767\n00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:23.340\none of my favorites is command to, that\nif you hit that, it just shows errors and\n\n768\n00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.050\nit takes out all\nthe informational messages.\n\n769\n00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:27.708\nSo there's ways you can filter,\nto narrow that information down, and\n\n770\n00:36:27.708 --> 00:36:29.438\nthat's usually where it's gonna be useful,\n\n771\n00:36:29.438 --> 00:36:32.475\notherwise you just get overwhelmed by\nthe logs and then they become less useful.\n\n772\n00:36:32.475 --> 00:36:35.322\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's never a good time had by anyone.\n\n773\n00:36:35.322 --> 00:36:39.928\nAll right, Don, well thanks for helping us\nget through application support inside of\n\n774\n00:36:39.928 --> 00:36:43.150\nMAC OS Sierra or 10.1.2,\nhowever you like it.\n\n775\n00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.120\nBut it does look like we\nare out of time for today.\n\n776\n00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.990\nWe do appreciate our audience for\njoining us as well.\n\n777\n00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:51.210\nHopefully you've learned a lot and\nit's gonna enrich your lives and\n\n778\n00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:52.630\nmaybe even pass an exam.\n\n779\n00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:54.960\nThat being said, it is time for\nus to sign out for ITPro.tv.\n\n780\n00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.000\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n781\n00:36:57.000 -->

00:00:08.347\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.347 --> 00:00:12.070\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.711\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:16.040\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.120\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we're coming\n\n8\n00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.880\nback at you with more on our Apple\nCertified Support Professional series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.276\nAnd joining us in the studio yet\nagain to lend his knowledge and\n\n10\n00:00:25.276 --> 00:00:27.640\nexpertise on that topic,\nour good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.500\nDon, so\nglad to have you back in the studio again.\n\n12\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.650\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.290\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n14\n00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.590\nI'm ready to talk about some\nnetwork configuration right?\n\n15\n00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.433\nWe talked a little bit about\nconfiguring networks way back,\n\n16\n00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.450\nin the initial Installing MacOS episode.\n\n17\n00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.122\nBut, we're going to revisit that,\ncuz there's a lot of options inside of\n\n18\n00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:47.180\nthere to get your device\nconnected to a network.\n\n19\n00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.927\nBack in the day,\nwe are going to our time machine again-\n\n20\n00:00:48.927 --> 00:00:50.024\n&gt;&gt; in 1997.\n\n21\n00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:53.682\n&gt;&gt; Back in the day, you didn't necessarily\nhook up to a network with your laptop or\n\n22\n00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:57.140\ndesktop machine, they operated\nindependently for the most case.\n\n23\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.426\nBut in today's world,\n\n24\n00:00:58.426 --> 00:01:01.910\nit is really rare that we don't\nexpect to have internet access.\n\n25\n00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.428\nEverywhere you go to a hotel you go to\na restaurant you go home you expect to\n\n26\n00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:05.934\nhave internet access available somehow.\n\n27\n00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:08.820\n&gt;&gt; I get quite indignant if I don't\nhave Internet access, actually.\n\n28\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.365\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What kind of backwater town have I\n\n29\n00:01:11.365 --> 00:01:12.459\nfound myself in?\n\n30\n00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.520\n[LAUGH] So we expect it right?\n\n31\n00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.846\nAnd that means we're gonna be ready to\nconnect to different types of networks and\n\n32\n00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:24.010\nit is becoming it's really easier and\nmore difficult all at the same time.\n\n33\n00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.010\nIt's really unusual that wireless\nnetworks should become very pervasive.\n\n34\n00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.480\nSo pretty much everywhere you go,\nyou find wireless networks these days, but\n\n35\n00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.420\nthere's different types, so we have to\nbe able to configure to connect to it.\n\n36\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.470\nPhysical networks are becoming less and\nless common but they are still out there.\n\n37\n00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.940\nUnfortunately, on your laptop,\nyou are less and\n\n38\n00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.650\nless likely to have a network jack.\n\n39\n00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.190\nFor example, my laptop doesn't have it.\n\n40\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.650\nDaniel's doesn't.\n\n41\n00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.190\nIf you go an buy a Mac today,\nany of the Mac Book or\n\n42\n00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.430\nthe Mac Book Pros,\nnone of them have network jacks anymore.\n\n43\n00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.965\nSo expect to use dongle.\n\n44\n00:01:53.965 --> 00:01:55.796\nYou're going to need add a hardware\ndongle to the outside to\n\n45\n00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:56.720\nget a physical network jack.\n\n46\n00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.690\nNow why would I care?\n\n47\n00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.180\nIf I have wireless why don't just\njump on the wireless and go?\n\n48\n00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.340\nWell for most people that is\nperfectly fine that's what you want.\n\n49\n00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.430\nJust jump on the wireless and go.\n\n50\n00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.430\nBut if you're running a server for\nexample you got OS10 server installed.\n\n51\n00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.367\nOr moving large quantities of data\na physical network connection is going\n\n52\n00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:21.920\nto be faster than a wireless one and\na more reliable connection too.\n\n53\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.810\nOne of the things we need to remember\nis that when you have a physical\n\n54\n00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.640\ncable plugged into your Mac,\nyou have full access to that cable.\n\n55\n00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.390\nAnd you can talk and communicate\nat the highest speeds available.\n\n56\n00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.470\nIt's either connected or\nit's not and that's it.\n\n57\n00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.970\nBut when you're on a wireless network,\n\n58\n00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.410\nthere are a number of\nthings that come into play.\n\n59\n00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.120\nFor example, each antenna on your\nwireless access point can only\n\n60\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.508\nsend or\nreceive data from one person at a time.\n\n61\n00:02:49.508 --> 00:02:51.210\nSo, if I'm trying to send and\n\n62\n00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.670\nreceive at the same time I'm gonna need\nto get more than one antenna involved.\n\n63\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.900\nAnd if more than one person is trying to\ntalk, we're gonna bump into each other and\n\n64\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.080\nwe have to take turns.\n\n65\n00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.033\nAnd so even though it might be\na very fast wireless network,\n\n66\n00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:04.760\nI'm limited by the amount\nof antennas that I've got.\n\n67\n00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.191\nAlso, the further away I get from\nthe access point, the slower and\n\n68\n00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:11.560\nslower my connection gets.\n\n69\n00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.920\nAnd so it might be capable of 500\nmegabits per second when I'm standing\n\n70\n00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.948\nright next to it.\n\n71\n00:03:15.948 --> 00:03:19.270\nAnd then I start walking away and getting\nfurther and further and it drops down and\n\n72\n00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.140\nall of a sudden it gets down to 64 megabit\nor down to 54 megabit, down to 11 megabit,\n\n73\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.210\ndown to 2 megabit.\n\n74\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.900\nAnd then it drops like a no connection.\n\n75\n00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.440\nUnlike a wired connection,\nwireless sometimes works,\n\n76\n00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.150\nsometimes it doesn't,\nsometimes it's fast, sometimes it's slow.\n\n77\n00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.450\nOn a wired connection,\nwe always know what we get.\n\n78\n00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.630\nSo for example,\nmy laptop right here in front of me.\n\n79\n00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.180\nIt's got a wireless adapter in it.\n\n80\n00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.690\nI'm connected to a wireless network.\n\n81\n00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.200\nI can see it right up here, right?\n\n82\n00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.530\nSo I'm connected to the ITProTV wireless\nnetwork, but I'm not actually using it.\n\n83\n00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.080\nI have a physical Thunderbolt donagal\nover here that's doing Thunderbolt\n\n84\n00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.790\nto network and\nI'm plugged into a physical network.\n\n85\n00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.022\nSo I've got an actual physical connection.\n\n86\n00:03:57.022 --> 00:03:59.160\nLarry has one laying around.\n\n87\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.420\nSo one of these jobbies.\n\n88\n00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.740\nNow this is Thunderbolt on one end and\na RJ-45 jack on the other,\n\n89\n00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.000\nwhich is suitable for\nplugging a physical copper network cable.\n\n90\n00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.950\nIf you've got the latest Mac Book Pro\nthen you're luckier than I am and\n\n91\n00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.470\nyou have USB-C instead.\n\n92\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.790\nAnd they make these same ones,\nthey look just like this,\n\n93\n00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.300\nexcept they are USB-C on this end\ninstead of thunderbolt like this.\n\n94\n00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.640\nSo, these little dongles can give you that\nphysical network access that you need.\n\n95\n00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.925\nWhen I'm on a show like this,\nI wanna have reliable,\n\n96\n00:04:27.925 --> 00:04:31.510\nstable network connectivity\nthat I know is going to work.\n\n97\n00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.000\nThat's why I physically plug in,\neven though I could use my wireless.\n\n98\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.860\nNow technically, I'm connected to both.\n\n99\n00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.020\nAnd I wouldn't know it if we\nlook at this menu, right?\n\n100\n00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.080\nWhen I click on this little\nwireless icon up here,\n\n101\n00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.880\nI'm seeing all wireless information.\n\n102\n00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.270\nAnd I see some wireless networks that\nare here in the building including ours.\n\n103\n00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.530\nAnd I see that I'm connected to it,\nright, cuz you got a check mark.\n\n104\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.920\nSo I know I'm connected, but I said I'm\nconnected to a physical network as well.\n\n105\n00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.980\nWhich one is it using?\n\n106\n00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.057\nThis is one of the first things that\nyou'll wanna configure on a laptop or\n\n107\n00:05:00.057 --> 00:05:03.440\na desktop to make sure that it's\npreferring the right adapter.\n\n108\n00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.120\nIf I go into my system preferences,\n\n109\n00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.922\nI actually could have done that\nfrom that menu that I was in.\n\n110\n00:05:07.922 --> 00:05:11.509\nBut if I go into System Preferences,\nI can go into Network.\n\n111\n00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.530\nAnd inside of Network, I'll see my\nadapters over here on the left.\n\n112\n00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.058\nAnd you know what, I'm lying I\nguess lying in the whole episode.\n\n113\n00:05:18.058 --> 00:05:19.704\n&gt;&gt; You're actually on the wireless.\n\n114\n00:05:19.704 --> 00:05:21.406\n&gt;&gt; I am actually on the wireless,\ninteresting.\n\n115\n00:05:21.406 --> 00:05:24.844\nSo good reason to come here to this screen\nto find out whether Don was telling\n\n116\n00:05:24.844 --> 00:05:26.060\nthe truth or not.\n\n117\n00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.960\nI can see my WiFi network.\n\n118\n00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.090\nAnd then I see a bunch of other\nconnections that I've got.\n\n119\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.990\nIncluding my Thunderbolt\nto Ethernet bridge, right?\n\n120\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.920\nThat's adapter that I've got plugged in.\n\n121\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.220\nAnd if you look at it it\nsays cable unplugged.\n\n122\n00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.290\nNow I am looking at it, oddly enough.\n\n123\n00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.345\n&gt;&gt; And that cable is plugged in.\n\n124\n00:05:43.345 --> 00:05:45.370\n&gt;&gt; And that cable is plugged in.\n\n125\n00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.235\nSo that tells me that the other end of\nthis cable must not be plugged in or\n\n126\n00:05:49.235 --> 00:05:52.064\nnot be connected and\nit's not getting a link line.\n\n127\n00:05:52.064 --> 00:05:55.784\nNow because it didn't get\na link it's disconnected and\n\n128\n00:05:55.784 --> 00:05:58.510\nI'm using my wireless here I am.\n\n129\n00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.910\n&gt;&gt; Don that's physical network\ntroubleshooting 101 right there check\n\n130\n00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.510\nthe physical connections.\n\n131\n00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.250\nAnd going here we can see\nthat was not connected.\n\n132\n00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.810\nNow we know we gotta check that cable,\nsee where it's terminating from.\n\n133\n00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.741\n&gt;&gt; I know, I got the route around here-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n134\n00:06:10.741 --> 00:06:11.296\n&gt;&gt; Onto the podium and\n\n135\n00:06:11.296 --> 00:06:12.969\ntrying to find that cable to be\nable to do that in a minute.\n\n136\n00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:17.480\nBut what's interesting here though\nis if you look at the order.\n\n137\n00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.100\nOkay, what's gonna happen is,\n\n138\n00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.830\nthe connections have\na certain preference to them.\n\n139\n00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.230\nIt prefers one adapter over another.\n\n140\n00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.990\nAnd it's done in the order of this list,\nokay.\n\n141\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.350\nNow if I disconnect my wireless for\na minute, right.\n\n142\n00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.970\nSo let me, let me just turn the WiFi off.\n\n143\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.750\nWhen I turn the WiFi off,\nsee how WiFi just dropped and\n\n144\n00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.740\nthen went way down here to\nthe bottom of the list, okay.\n\n145\n00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.250\nThis is the order of preference.\n\n146\n00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.020\nIt will prefer the first\nconnection in the list.\n\n147\n00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.290\nIn my little error console connection I\nadd this little error console device I\n\n148\n00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.830\nused to connect to Cisco equipment.\n\n149\n00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.500\nSo those are proprietary\nthings that I've got.\n\n150\n00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.010\nYou usually won't have those.\n\n151\n00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.820\nBut the next one is Bluetooth, a Bluetooth\nPAN, or Bluetooth personal area network.\n\n152\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.900\nIf I made a Bluetooth\nconnection to Daniel's laptop,\n\n153\n00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.220\nthat would be my preferred\ndata connection.\n\n154\n00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.257\nThen, I've got a USB ethernet adapter and\n\n155\n00:07:09.257 --> 00:07:14.452\nthat's one that is just placed in a USB\nport instead of Thunderbolt port and\n\n156\n00:07:14.452 --> 00:07:18.260\nI don't even have it attached\nto the laptop right now.\n\n157\n00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.510\nIt's in my office,\npart of my docking station.\n\n158\n00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.160\nThen I've got the Thunderbolt\nethernet adapter.\n\n159\n00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.924\nThat's the one that is plugged in, but for\n\n160\n00:07:24.924 --> 00:07:27.500\nsome reason is not getting\na link light right now.\n\n161\n00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.880\nAnd then I've got WiFi.\n\n162\n00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.352\nNow, because Thunderbolt\nis listed above WiFi,\n\n163\n00:07:32.352 --> 00:07:37.490\nif both of them were active,\nI would prefer the Thunderbolt connection.\n\n164\n00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.850\nIt's the more reliable,\nthe fast one that's the one I want.\n\n165\n00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.860\nWiFi would only be preferred if\nthe one's above it were disconnected.\n\n166\n00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.710\nAnd you can change this order,\nif you want.\n\n167\n00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.188\nIf you go down here to the gear and\nclick on it,\n\n168\n00:07:48.188 --> 00:07:50.879\nyou'll see where you can\nset the service order.\n\n169\n00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:54.601\nAnd setting the service order is how\nyou can come in and dictate, hey,\n\n170\n00:07:54.601 --> 00:07:57.837\nI want Thunderbolt,\nthat needs to be my number one, right?\n\n171\n00:07:57.837 --> 00:08:01.402\nThat's gonna be my preferred\nconnection Wi-Fi would be next,\n\n172\n00:08:01.402 --> 00:08:03.588\nbut I've got that USB connector.\n\n173\n00:08:03.588 --> 00:08:05.705\nI want USB to be after Thunderbolt, right.\n\n174\n00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:07.290\nThunderbolt would be the fastest.\n\n175\n00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.695\nMy USB connection would be next.\n\n176\n00:08:08.695 --> 00:08:11.835\nWi-Fi would be in third place and\nI got all this other junk down here.\n\n177\n00:08:11.835 --> 00:08:15.201\nYou know, I may not use very often and\nI can leave it lower priority,but you can\n\n178\n00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:17.600\nre-arrange it based on\nwhat's your best connection.\n\n179\n00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.230\nAnd that way if you're connected to one or\n\n180\n00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.040\nmore thing,\nit will prefer the physical connection.\n\n181\n00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.760\nSo now that I've done that,\n\n182\n00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.590\nI see it change its ordering\nhere to reflect what I just did.\n\n183\n00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:32.130\nAnd if I start to bring these active,\nthe active one will move to the top.\n\n184\n00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:32.730\nBecause it's active.\n\n185\n00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.420\nThat already makes is preferable to\nall the ones that are disconnected.\n\n186\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.850\nWhy would I prefer one that\nis disconnected, right?\n\n187\n00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.320\nSo I can come and turn Wi-Fi back on.\n\n188\n00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.660\nAnd that one is gonna jump\nback up right there, okay.\n\n189\n00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.810\nAnd then, you know what, maybe I'll\nsteal Daniel's network cable here.\n\n190\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.850\nAnd when I plug it in,\nI'll see if my link light comes up.\n\n191\n00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.210\nAnd we'll see this one jump in and\nbecome the preferred connection.\n\n192\n00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.860\n&gt;&gt; Actually Dan, I just switched the\ncable, so you should be pretty good to go.\n\n193\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.680\n&gt;&gt; Sweet.\nAll right.\n\n194\n00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.900\nSo if we take a look back\nat my computer again,\n\n195\n00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.600\nI've got the Wi-Fi connection, right.\n\n196\n00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.090\nSo that's my preferred connection\nright now, because it works.\n\n197\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.690\nWorking is better than not working.\n\n198\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.230\nEverything else here is\nsort of by priority.\n\n199\n00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.902\nAnd I'm going to plug in my newly\nfunctional Ethernet adapter.\n\n200\n00:09:10.902 --> 00:09:12.106\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; Hey!\n\n201\n00:09:12.106 --> 00:09:13.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I had a moment of trepidation there.\n\n202\n00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.340\nI think it's going to work.\n\n203\n00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:15.890\nThere it is.\n\n204\n00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:16.830\nSo now I'm connected.\n\n205\n00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.020\nAnd I'm plugged into two networks at once.\n\n206\n00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.870\nAnd which one is preferred?\n\n207\n00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:21.630\n&gt;&gt; The one on the top.\n\n208\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.770\n&gt;&gt; Right, because I set the service order.\n\n209\n00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.390\nWhen you buy a Mac,\n\n210\n00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.150\na MacBook, a Mac Pro, whatever, it has\na fixed amount of network ports on it.\n\n211\n00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.532\nAnd so that order is going to be\nset by the operating system and\n\n212\n00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:34.646\nit will be set in the right order,\nthe way you want it.\n\n213\n00:09:34.646 --> 00:09:36.561\nBut when you start bringing\ndongles into the mix,\n\n214\n00:09:36.561 --> 00:09:39.070\nthey do not always get\nsorted in the right order.\n\n215\n00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.535\nAnd you might have a situation where\nyou've got a ten gigabit fiber connection\n\n216\n00:09:43.535 --> 00:09:47.269\nrun to your Mac, like we do with\nour editing stations back there.\n\n217\n00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:49.015\nAnd then it's using the stupid\nwireless connection.\n\n218\n00:09:49.015 --> 00:09:51.317\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is so slow.\n\n219\n00:09:51.317 --> 00:09:53.350\n&gt;&gt; That was there when\nthe network was configured.\n\n220\n00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.590\nSo always a good idea to go in and\ncheck that out.\n\n221\n00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.630\nAnd there's a number of different\ntypes of networks that you'll see.\n\n222\n00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:03.380\nWhen you buy a Mac,\nit's normally gonna have wireless.\n\n223\n00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.116\nI believe every Mac sold\ntoday has Wi-Fi in it.\n\n224\n00:10:07.116 --> 00:10:09.820\nI'm pretty sure every Mac for the last\nseveral years has had Wi-Fi in it.\n\n225\n00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.550\nIt may not have a physical\nnetwork jack though.\n\n226\n00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.240\nThe Mac Pros do, the Mac Minis do,\nbut most of the other ones don't.\n\n227\n00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.290\niMacs still do, but\nmost of the others don't.\n\n228\n00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.600\nAll the laptops, they've gone away\nfrom having a physical network jack.\n\n229\n00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.880\nSo if you add one with a dongle,\nbe sure to check.\n\n230\n00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.581\nThere's also nonstandard network types.\n\n231\n00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:28.280\nThere's things like Bluetooth.\n\n232\n00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.634\nAnd so\nI can create a Bluetooth connection,\n\n233\n00:10:30.634 --> 00:10:34.280\nwhich is a wireless connection to\nanother Mac or to your iPhone.\n\n234\n00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.230\nI connect it to my iPhone all the time,\nbecause I'll do tethering.\n\n235\n00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.772\nSo if I'm on the road and\nI need Internet access from my laptop, but\n\n236\n00:10:40.772 --> 00:10:45.011\nI don't have a wireless network, I can\njust tether to my phone via Bluetooth and\n\n237\n00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:47.942\nbrowse the internet or\nwhatever else I am trying to do.\n\n238\n00:10:47.942 --> 00:10:49.670\nSo that is another type of\nconnection you'll see here.\n\n239\n00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.250\nIf you ever go down to\nthe bottom of this list and\n\n240\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.620\nhit the plus sign, you'll see\nwhere you can add virtual network.\n\n241\n00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:01.278\nSo you can add things like additional\nThunderbolt adapters, if you expect them,\n\n242\n00:11:01.278 --> 00:11:07.187\nBluetooth, Wi-Fi, VPN, PPPoE, which is\npoint to point protocol over Ethernet.\n\n243\n00:11:07.187 --> 00:11:10.450\nYou use that with some cable modems and\nsome DSL.\n\n244\n00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.932\n6to4, which is an IPv6 to IPv4 tunnel.\n\n245\n00:11:13.932 --> 00:11:15.950\nThese are all different\ntypes of network interfaces.\n\n246\n00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.778\nThese three are virtual, not physical.\n\n247\n00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:19.694\nSo you can add as many\nof those as you want.\n\n248\n00:11:19.694 --> 00:11:21.960\nThese other ones up here are all physical.\n\n249\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.040\nAnd if I chose something\nlike to add a Thunderbolt to\n\n250\n00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.310\ninterface like that, well,\nthat interface already exists.\n\n251\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:31.250\nIt's already there, right?\n\n252\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.410\nThat's why it's showing up.\n\n253\n00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.190\nThese guys are the ones that I can add.\n\n254\n00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.110\nThese up here are ones that\nit's seen in the past.\n\n255\n00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.880\nYou can rename them.\n\n256\n00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.520\nFor example, if I have more than one\nThunderbolt adapter that I've used, right?\n\n257\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.183\nSo I've got two.\n\n258\n00:11:45.183 --> 00:11:46.680\nI don't know which is which.\n\n259\n00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.078\nSo I might rename these to say Don's dock\nor something like that, that USB one.\n\n260\n00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:54.340\nWhere did it go?\n\n261\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.190\nActually, it's not even\nshowing up in here, is it?\n\n262\n00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.120\nI guess maybe cuz I'm using it right now.\n\n263\n00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.540\nBut you can rename them.\n\n264\n00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.360\nSo I can call this one like\nDocking Station, right?\n\n265\n00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.610\nAnd by doing that,\nI can create that entry, and so\n\n266\n00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.190\nit will have a name that's relevant to me.\n\n267\n00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.809\nAnd since it's not connected,\nit's going to show up.\n\n268\n00:12:09.809 --> 00:12:10.440\nThat was a bad example.\n\n269\n00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.597\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n270\n00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:13.363\nthen it would have a name that\nwould make a little more sense.\n\n271\n00:12:13.363 --> 00:12:16.780\nSo you can certainly do\nthat on a lot of these.\n\n272\n00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.400\nAs you click on each network though,\n\n273\n00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.770\nyou'll notice over here the options\nare a little bit different.\n\n274\n00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.390\nSome of them, like when you\nchoose Ethernet, you jump in and\n\n275\n00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.000\nyou see the IP address configuration and\nthat's that.\n\n276\n00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.928\nBut other ones like wireless, I'm seeing\nwhich Wi-Fi network I'm connected to.\n\n277\n00:12:30.928 --> 00:12:34.843\nAnd I actually have to go down here into\nthe advanced settings before I start to\n\n278\n00:12:34.843 --> 00:12:38.170\nsee stuff like where I can set\nthe IP address and all of that.\n\n279\n00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:39.900\nIt's organized a little differently.\n\n280\n00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.600\nWireless networks generally expect us\nto automatically get an IP address.\n\n281\n00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.730\nSomebody on the network just gives\nus the address to be able to use.\n\n282\n00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.950\nBut on a wired network,\nit's very common to have a static address,\n\n283\n00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.760\nan address that we type in there\nin order to use networks, so\n\n284\n00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.560\nwe've always got the same address, and\nyou'll see I've done that right here.\n\n285\n00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.120\nMine is assigned manually.\n\n286\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.250\nI manually typed in this IP address.\n\n287\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.420\nWell, let's talk about that a little bit,\n\n288\n00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.410\nbecause there's actually two different\ntypes of addresses that we see on\n\n289\n00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.710\na modern networks.\n\n290\n00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:11.440\nWhat I'm saying here Is IPv4,\ninternet protocol version 4.\n\n291\n00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.550\nWhen you communicate on the network,\n\n292\n00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:18.685\nthe most common protocol in\nuse today is called TCPIP.\n\n293\n00:13:18.685 --> 00:13:21.580\nTCP is the transmission control protocol.\n\n294\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.452\nAnd it's responsible for\ntransmission control.\n\n295\n00:13:24.452 --> 00:13:27.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When I'm talking to another computer,\n\n296\n00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.495\nwhat tells my computer it's okay to send?\n\n297\n00:13:29.495 --> 00:13:31.440\nWhat tells the other computer to listen?\n\n298\n00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.741\n&gt;&gt; It tells it, it's done.\n\n299\n00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:34.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nhow do you know when you're finished?\n\n300\n00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.540\nWhether the data is corrupt?\n\n301\n00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.660\nHow do you know?\n\n302\n00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.684\nTCP does that.\n\n303\n00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:41.330\nTransmission control protocol takes care\nof that and it's very efficient at it.\n\n304\n00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.560\nIt's been around a long time.\n\n305\n00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.810\nThere's not a good replacement\nout there for it, because it's so\n\n306\n00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:45.620\ngood at what it does.\n\n307\n00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.596\nSo TCP has been around a long time.\n\n308\n00:13:47.596 --> 00:13:50.190\nIt's gonna continue to\nbe around a long time.\n\n309\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.200\nWhen you browse to a webpage,\nit's usually done via TCP.\n\n310\n00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.920\nThere is a sister protocol to it\ncalled UDP, user datagram protocol.\n\n311\n00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.340\nIt's only used with streaming\nproducts typically.\n\n312\n00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.560\nThe big difference is TCP is what's\ncalled a reliable transport.\n\n313\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.100\nWhen I send data via TCP, I know\nit's going to get to the other side.\n\n314\n00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.640\nAnd if it doesn't get to the other side,\nthe other side will know it's missing and\n\n315\n00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.150\ncan ask me to resend it.\n\n316\n00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.900\nThe other side will say hey,\n\n317\n00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.930\nDon, I didn't get this packet,\ncan you send it back to me again?\n\n318\n00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.710\nAnd I'll retransmit it to the other side.\n\n319\n00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.553\nTCP does it automatically\nin the background.\n\n320\n00:14:21.553 --> 00:14:24.527\nIt's reliable as long as\nthere's a connection.\n\n321\n00:14:24.527 --> 00:14:29.050\nUDP on the other hand,\nis what's called a best effort protocol.\n\n322\n00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.920\nIt's gonna throw that\ndata to the other side.\n\n323\n00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.557\nIt'll do the best it can to get it there.\n\n324\n00:14:32.557 --> 00:14:33.820\nBut if it doesn't get there?\n\n325\n00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.215\n&gt;&gt; What are you gonna do?\n\n326\n00:14:35.215 --> 00:14:37.051\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That sounds bad.\n\n327\n00:14:37.051 --> 00:14:38.770\nImagine if I'm sending\nan email to somebody.\n\n328\n00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:39.810\n&gt;&gt; You'd fire that employee, right?\n\n329\n00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:44.001\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've been terminated and\nI just sent it.\n\n330\n00:14:44.001 --> 00:14:45.126\nMaybe they get it, maybe they don't.\n\n331\n00:14:45.126 --> 00:14:46.270\nWhatever.\n\n332\n00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.380\nIt's not suitable for email.\n\n333\n00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.500\nEmail always uses TCP, right.\n\n334\n00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.130\nBut what if I'm watching a football\ngame live on the internet, right?\n\n335\n00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:58.680\nSo live streaming a football game, and\nthe quarterback goes to throw the ball, or\n\n336\n00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.785\nwell, let's be European here for a minute,\nright, so the striker kicks the ball.\n\n337\n00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:02.848\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, which ever football it is that\n\n338\n00:15:02.848 --> 00:15:03.720\nwe're watching.\n\n339\n00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.660\nThe ball is going towards the goal or\n\n340\n00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.010\nspherical like object is\ngoing towards the goal.\n\n341\n00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.870\nAnd we drop a frame.\n\n342\n00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.390\nWe drop a packet, right?\n\n343\n00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:19.510\nWell, if you're using TCP, it's gonna stop\nright there, pause and say retransmit.\n\n344\n00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:21.810\nSend me that one frame and\nthen it retransmits it and\n\n345\n00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.710\nthen it starts playing again.\n\n346\n00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.720\nWell, now I'm not live anymore am I?\n\n347\n00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.660\nNow I'm a fraction of a second behind.\n\n348\n00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.730\nAnd it happens over, and\nover, and over again.\n\n349\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.980\nI get further and further behind.\n\n350\n00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.010\nIt's not live.\n\n351\n00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.430\nRight?\nYou just broke the live stream.\n\n352\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.720\nInstead, wouldn't it have made more sense\nif the ball was moving through the air,\n\n353\n00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.170\nand all of a sudden it just [NOISE]\nMoved forward a little bit further.\n\n354\n00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.870\nNow I'm still live and yeah,\nI lost a little frame, but who cares?\n\n355\n00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:44.704\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nRight?\n\n356\n00:15:44.704 --> 00:15:46.843\nAnd with videos-\n&gt;&gt; The experience didn't change with\n\n357\n00:15:46.843 --> 00:15:47.866\nthe live streaming.\n\n358\n00:15:47.866 --> 00:15:48.820\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n359\n00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.296\nAnd nowhere is that more true than voice.\n\n360\n00:15:51.296 --> 00:15:53.924\nWhen you're placing a phone\ncall via a network,\n\n361\n00:15:53.924 --> 00:15:56.754\nright, you don't want it\nretransmitting frames.\n\n362\n00:15:56.754 --> 00:15:58.325\nIt will sound jumbled up and messy, or\n\n363\n00:15:58.325 --> 00:16:01.629\nit will sound like you're talking to\na war correspondent in a foreign country.\n\n364\n00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:04.422\nSo Daniel what's it like\nout there on the field?\n\n365\n00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:06.766\n&gt;&gt; Good to be with you Don,\nyeah it'd be like that yeah.\n\n366\n00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:07.581\n&gt;&gt; You get that delay.\n\n367\n00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:09.172\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And that's not really suitable.\n\n368\n00:16:09.172 --> 00:16:13.404\nSo UDP just throws it right out\nthere as fast as it can all right.\n\n369\n00:16:13.404 --> 00:16:16.698\nSo we don't see that one as often,\ncuz it's usually just streaming.\n\n370\n00:16:16.698 --> 00:16:19.761\nThere are a few other places that use it\nbut for the most part TCP is what we use.\n\n371\n00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:23.660\nNow In order for two TCP to work two\ncomputers have to talk to each other.\n\n372\n00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.491\nAnd for the two computers to talk\nthey have to find each other and\n\n373\n00:16:27.491 --> 00:16:29.887\nthey find each other using addresses.\n\n374\n00:16:29.887 --> 00:16:32.911\nAnd there's two main types\nof addresses right now,\n\n375\n00:16:32.911 --> 00:16:36.842\nthe old addresses which are IPv for\nInternet protocol version for.\n\n376\n00:16:36.842 --> 00:16:40.836\nAnd the new addresses which is\ninternet protocol version six,\n\n377\n00:16:40.836 --> 00:16:42.576\ntwo different protocols.\n\n378\n00:16:42.576 --> 00:16:47.156\nLet's talk about IPv4 to start here,\nmost of you are running IPv4.\n\n379\n00:16:47.156 --> 00:16:52.144\nAs of right now 2017, IPv4 is the most\nused addressing scheme in the planet,\n\n380\n00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:55.203\nand it's gonna stay that way for\na few more years.\n\n381\n00:16:55.203 --> 00:16:59.808\nBut we're seeing this migration to IPv6\nbecause of some of the limitations.\n\n382\n00:16:59.808 --> 00:17:02.104\nAn IPv4 address looks like this, right?\n\n383\n00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:05.743\nIt's four numbers separated by dots or\nperiods, right?\n\n384\n00:17:05.743 --> 00:17:07.658\nIt's called a dotted decimal notation.\n\n385\n00:17:07.658 --> 00:17:12.591\nAnd what you're looking at here\nis what would normally be written\n\n386\n00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:14.211\nas 32 binary bits.\n\n387\n00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:17.403\nBut it's been converted into decimal\nnumbers to make it easier for\n\n388\n00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:19.006\nus to read as human beings right.\n\n389\n00:17:19.006 --> 00:17:22.992\nCuz 32 ones and zeros doesn't exactly\nroll right off the tongue but\n\n390\n00:17:22.992 --> 00:17:27.197\n10.0.222.221, that's not so\nhard to remember, right.\n\n391\n00:17:27.197 --> 00:17:29.644\nThat’s why they kind of\nconvert it to this format.\n\n392\n00:17:29.644 --> 00:17:32.389\nNow when you write an address like this,\n\n393\n00:17:32.389 --> 00:17:36.762\nright let me show you an example\nlet me try and show you Here we go.\n\n394\n00:17:36.762 --> 00:17:39.204\nAll right, it's a 32-bit address.\n\n395\n00:17:39.204 --> 00:17:42.288\nIf I take a number like 10.0.10.222.\n\n396\n00:17:42.288 --> 00:17:45.943\nActually, let me pick something\nmaybe a little bit easier for\n\n397\n00:17:45.943 --> 00:17:48.200\nme, like 192.168.0.1.\n\n398\n00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:54.899\nAll right, if I were to write that\nnumber in the true binary version.\n\n399\n00:17:54.899 --> 00:17:59.566\nWe'll start at 192 which,\nin binary, is that, right?\n\n400\n00:17:59.566 --> 00:18:02.476\nAnd the dots, the computer doesn't\ncare about but I'll put it-\n\n401\n00:18:02.476 --> 00:18:03.940\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] there for us, right?\n\n402\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.911\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, and then 168, that'll be\na little harder to convert it right.\n\n403\n00:18:06.911 --> 00:18:08.387\nSo I need 40 on top of that.\n\n404\n00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:11.924\nSo that will be there and\nthen I need that here.\n\n405\n00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:15.361\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; One, two, three, four one more zero.\n\n406\n00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:16.217\nThere we go.\n\n407\n00:18:16.217 --> 00:18:20.448\nAnd sorry my binaries are a little bit\nrusty and I'm doing this in my head.\n\n408\n00:18:20.448 --> 00:18:21.824\n&gt;&gt; Zero is the hardest binary number.\n\n409\n00:18:21.824 --> 00:18:23.702\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n410\n00:18:23.702 --> 00:18:24.677\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n411\n00:18:24.677 --> 00:18:26.973\nAnd if we take those dots out cuz\nthe computer doesn't care about the dot,\n\n412\n00:18:26.973 --> 00:18:27.870\nthe dot is there for humans.\n\n413\n00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:32.708\nAnd if I take that out,\nThat is 192.168.0.1, written in binary,\n\n414\n00:18:32.708 --> 00:18:35.070\nwritten the way the computer sees it.\n\n415\n00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.575\nThat's not terribly\nuseful to us as humans.\n\n416\n00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:38.652\nI'm not gonna remember that.\n\n417\n00:18:38.652 --> 00:18:40.578\nI had a hard time writing it there myself.\n\n418\n00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:43.648\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you were like,\ngo to itpro.tv but we didn't have that.\n\n419\n00:18:43.648 --> 00:18:49.671\nYou just had, yeah, go to 1000001010100\nHold on, was it 001, or 1001?\n\n420\n00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.115\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n421\n00:18:52.115 --> 00:18:53.379\nyou can see where it would get confusing.\n\n422\n00:18:53.379 --> 00:18:54.186\n&gt;&gt; It's a mess.\n\n423\n00:18:54.186 --> 00:18:55.647\nSo this is the old scheme.\n\n424\n00:18:55.647 --> 00:18:58.140\nAnd the old scheme gives you\na number that's reasonable.\n\n425\n00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.415\nThe problem is it's only 32 bits.\n\n426\n00:19:00.415 --> 00:19:06.704\nAnd a 32 bit address allows for\n4,294,900, no, 4 billion, sorry.\n\n427\n00:19:06.704 --> 00:19:07.389\n&gt;&gt; 4 billion.\n\n428\n00:19:07.389 --> 00:19:11.987\n&gt;&gt; 4,294,967,295 addresses,\nor roughly 4.3 billion.\n\n429\n00:19:11.987 --> 00:19:13.752\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot.\n\n430\n00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:16.626\n&gt;&gt; Now when this was created\nback in the 1970s and\n\n431\n00:19:16.626 --> 00:19:20.330\n1980s the Earth's population\nwas around 4.3 billion.\n\n432\n00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.765\nSo every person on the planet\ncould have one address.\n\n433\n00:19:22.765 --> 00:19:26.838\nAnd back then,\nnot many people had computers right.\n\n434\n00:19:26.838 --> 00:19:29.606\nComputers were still big they were\nexpensive, sure there were some Tandy's\n\n435\n00:19:29.606 --> 00:19:32.265\nthat were nice and small but for\nthe most part they were really expensive.\n\n436\n00:19:32.265 --> 00:19:36.295\nThey never envisioned People, everybody\nneeding their own IP address, and\n\n437\n00:19:36.295 --> 00:19:39.085\nthey never vision people\nneeding even more than one.\n\n438\n00:19:39.085 --> 00:19:43.033\nTake a look at me, I've got a laptop,\nI've got a tablet, I've got a cellphone,\n\n439\n00:19:43.033 --> 00:19:45.054\nI've got a desktop, I got two desktops.\n\n440\n00:19:45.054 --> 00:19:51.632\nIf you walk into my house I got\na Roku video player, Apple TV.\n\n441\n00:19:51.632 --> 00:19:56.214\nYou’ve got video games consoles, things\nlike that All of these things take an IP,\n\n442\n00:19:56.214 --> 00:19:58.643\nmy stinking thermostat uses an IP address.\n\n443\n00:19:58.643 --> 00:20:03.503\nAll of that, I myself probably consume a\ngood 12 to 15 addresses with all the junk\n\n444\n00:20:03.503 --> 00:20:06.932\nI got, and most of that's just\nconsumer novelty garbage.\n\n445\n00:20:06.932 --> 00:20:08.641\nIt doesn't really serve a great purpose.\n\n446\n00:20:08.641 --> 00:20:13.399\nThey didn't envision all of this kind\nof commoditized Internet access back in\n\n447\n00:20:13.399 --> 00:20:16.363\nthe 1970s, but that's where we are today.\n\n448\n00:20:16.363 --> 00:20:20.180\nAnd today,\npeople eat up IP addresses like crazy.\n\n449\n00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:25.080\nSo they opted to change to\na new addressing scheme, IPv6,\n\n450\n00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.928\nto correct that size limitation.\n\n451\n00:20:27.928 --> 00:20:30.745\nRight now,\nwe are running out of IPv4 addresses.\n\n452\n00:20:30.745 --> 00:20:33.399\nTechnically at the highest level,\nthey're already out and\n\n453\n00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:37.054\nit's starting to trickle down and we're\nrunning out at small of the lower levels.\n\n454\n00:20:37.054 --> 00:20:40.653\nAs soon as those run out,\nThen they'll be real pain on the network,\n\n455\n00:20:40.653 --> 00:20:42.684\nand we'll be forced to move to IPv6.\n\n456\n00:20:42.684 --> 00:20:45.056\nRight now it's kind of optional,\nand some people have moved over.\n\n457\n00:20:45.056 --> 00:20:45.863\nSome people haven't.\n\n458\n00:20:45.863 --> 00:20:48.790\nSo we're seeing this gradual\nmove over to the IPv6 world.\n\n459\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.838\nNow, IPv6 changes the address a good bit.\n\n460\n00:20:52.838 --> 00:20:59.409\nIt's a 128 bit address,\n4 times the size of IPv4, right.\n\n461\n00:20:59.409 --> 00:21:01.841\nThat means the address is much,\nmuch longer.\n\n462\n00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:05.482\nBut it means we end up with many,\nmany more addresses.\n\n463\n00:21:05.482 --> 00:21:08.986\nInstead of 4.3 billion,\nwe have this crazy,\n\n464\n00:21:08.986 --> 00:21:12.836\ninsane number that's actually\ngoing off my screen.\n\n465\n00:21:12.836 --> 00:21:14.941\nI can't even zoom out to get that.\n\n466\n00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:16.490\nIt just continues on.\n\n467\n00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:20.172\n[LAUGH] It's a big, big number.\n\n468\n00:21:20.172 --> 00:21:25.586\nAnd what it is is so many IP addresses.\n\n469\n00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:27.483\nBasically, they said,\nwe're gonna pick addresses, so\n\n470\n00:21:27.483 --> 00:21:28.498\nwe never have to do this again.\n\n471\n00:21:28.498 --> 00:21:29.081\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n472\n00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:32.503\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We don't ever want to run out again.\n\n473\n00:21:32.503 --> 00:21:34.876\nThis number, it's actually got a name.\n\n474\n00:21:34.876 --> 00:21:36.538\nIt's 340 undecillion,\n\n475\n00:21:36.538 --> 00:21:40.215\nwhich is some crazy number that\nis meaningless to us as humans.\n\n476\n00:21:40.215 --> 00:21:43.806\nSo let's try and put this into\na format that we can understand.\n\n477\n00:21:43.806 --> 00:21:47.225\nThe Earth's population today\nis a hair over six billion.\n\n478\n00:21:47.225 --> 00:21:49.526\nSo there's over six billion\npeople on the planet.\n\n479\n00:21:49.526 --> 00:21:55.413\nWell remember, on our IPv4,\nthere were 4.3 billion addresses, right?\n\n480\n00:21:55.413 --> 00:21:56.160\nSo not enough.\n\n481\n00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.871\nUnder IPv6,\nI could take the 6 billion people,\n\n482\n00:22:00.871 --> 00:22:04.133\nand I could give every one of them.\n\n483\n00:22:04.133 --> 00:22:09.040\n4.3 billion addresses and\nwe'd still have plenty left over.\n\n484\n00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.631\nThat's how big this address base is,\nit's massive.\n\n485\n00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:14.800\nThat's what IPv6 gives us.\n\n486\n00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.418\nThat's the reason they're\nmoving towards it.\n\n487\n00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:20.209\nNow IPv6 has a lot of other features\nthat are great that you'll want to take\n\n488\n00:22:20.209 --> 00:22:21.001\nadvantage of.\n\n489\n00:22:21.001 --> 00:22:25.400\nBut at the heart of it is addressing\nIPv6 uses more addresses.\n\n490\n00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.531\n&gt;&gt; It's actually 7 billion now.\n\n491\n00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:27.389\n&gt;&gt; 7 billion?\n\n492\n00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:28.179\n&gt;&gt; 7 billion.\n\n493\n00:22:28.179 --> 00:22:28.884\n&gt;&gt; Very busy.\n\n494\n00:22:28.884 --> 00:22:33.913\n[LAUGH] So a lot of people it's\nnot getting smaller right.\n\n495\n00:22:33.913 --> 00:22:40.124\nWe wanna launch people in the space yet,\nso it is a problem and it solves it right.\n\n496\n00:22:40.124 --> 00:22:43.494\nThe only challenge that it creates for us\nis that the addresses get really big and\n\n497\n00:22:43.494 --> 00:22:45.471\nwe can't even write them\nin decimal anymore.\n\n498\n00:22:45.471 --> 00:22:47.161\nMost of them are gonna be\nwritten in hexadecimals.\n\n499\n00:22:47.161 --> 00:22:50.301\nSo here's an example this is the IPv6\naddress that my laptop has and\n\n500\n00:22:50.301 --> 00:22:54.396\nyou'll see where it's got letters in the\naddress It's usually hexadecimal, right?\n\n501\n00:22:54.396 --> 00:22:59.785\nNormally, we use decimal, which is\nevery digit is a value 0-9, right?\n\n502\n00:22:59.785 --> 00:23:05.730\nSo I have like 1-9 and\nthen I have 10-99 and\n\n503\n00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.995\n100-999, right?\n\n504\n00:23:08.995 --> 00:23:13.209\nEach digit represents ten possible values,\nzero to nine, yeah.\n\n505\n00:23:13.209 --> 00:23:17.833\nIn hexadecimal though,\nit's zero through nine and\n\n506\n00:23:17.833 --> 00:23:22.360\nthen A through F for\na total of 16 values, right?\n\n507\n00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.923\nSo when I look at F,\nThat's actually the 16th value, right.\n\n508\n00:23:26.923 --> 00:23:30.915\nBut it starts at 0, so\nit's zero through 15 really, so\n\n509\n00:23:30.915 --> 00:23:34.264\nF would represent 15, 0 would represent 0.\n\n510\n00:23:34.264 --> 00:23:39.082\nWhen I see something like A,\nA represents 10 and B represents 11 and\n\n511\n00:23:39.082 --> 00:23:43.109\nC represents 12 and\nthen it just goes up until you get to F.\n\n512\n00:23:43.109 --> 00:23:44.617\nSo they represent 16 values.\n\n513\n00:23:44.617 --> 00:23:49.484\nand that means we can represent a much\nlarger address in a smaller space.\n\n514\n00:23:49.484 --> 00:23:51.259\nSo IPv6 addresses look funny, and\n\n515\n00:23:51.259 --> 00:23:55.296\nthat's kind of the way they're arranged\nright there, as letters and numbers.\n\n516\n00:23:55.296 --> 00:23:59.930\nThey separate them with colons to indicate\nthe separations there to make it a little\n\n517\n00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.463\nmore human readable to us.\n\n518\n00:24:01.463 --> 00:24:05.003\nMeanwhile in the background the computer\njust converts it to binary,\n\n519\n00:24:05.003 --> 00:24:08.480\nit's 128 1s and 0s which really\ndoesn't roll of the tongue.\n\n520\n00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.080\nIf 32 didn't, 128 absolutely doesn't.\n\n521\n00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.450\nThat's how the computer see's it though,\nthat's what's going on in the background.\n\n522\n00:24:14.765 --> 00:24:17.895\nNow when I look at my network\nconfiguration here, I just see IPv4.\n\n523\n00:24:17.895 --> 00:24:22.945\nAnd that's because Apple knows most\nof us are only using IPv4 right now.\n\n524\n00:24:22.945 --> 00:24:28.165\nBut IPv6 is enabled, if I go into my\nAdvanced settings here, and take a look,\n\n525\n00:24:28.165 --> 00:24:32.445\nI can come in here and see IPv4,\nand right beneath it I see IPv6.\n\n526\n00:24:32.445 --> 00:24:35.505\nAnd it's set to Automatic,\nI can change it to Manually, and\n\n527\n00:24:35.505 --> 00:24:39.820\nI can punch in an IPv6 address and\nrouter and so on to connect to.\n\n528\n00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.884\nSo we've got that IPv6 support,\nit's turned on.\n\n529\n00:24:42.884 --> 00:24:48.552\nIf I, you can't really see it here,\nbut if I drop to my terminal and\n\n530\n00:24:48.552 --> 00:24:53.715\nlet me fire up a good old Unix\ncommand here a little ifconfig,\n\n531\n00:24:53.715 --> 00:24:59.300\nand take a look at my physical\ninterface which is en0, this guy.\n\n532\n00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:04.340\nAll right, so\nhere is my physical interface, and if take\n\n533\n00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:11.500\na look inside of it I'll see where I've\ngot a inet address and an inet6 address.\n\n534\n00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:19.030\ninet that's the old IPv4 and then inet6\nthat's my IPv6 address right there.\n\n535\n00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.690\nSo I've actually got both, by default.\n\n536\n00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:22.530\nSo you are using both.\n\n537\n00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.970\nAnd on the exam you need to be\nfamiliar with both types of addresses.\n\n538\n00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.360\nThey're not going to ask you to\ndo anything crazy with them but\n\n539\n00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.170\njust to understand the difference between\nthe two and know that when you're setting\n\n540\n00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.830\nup a network connection, you'll need\nto be aware of both network types.\n\n541\n00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.084\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don, I'm looking at your\nscreen there, you also have another,\n\n542\n00:25:37.084 --> 00:25:39.703\nwhat looks to be,\nhex type of addressing going on there.\n\n543\n00:25:39.703 --> 00:25:40.295\nWhat's going on there?\n\n544\n00:25:40.295 --> 00:25:43.747\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so this one,\nit's labeled here as an ether address, or\n\n545\n00:25:43.747 --> 00:25:46.140\nether depending on how you want to say it.\n\n546\n00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:47.810\nBut it's actually called a MAC address.\n\n547\n00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:52.425\nAnd not Mac like Macintosh,\nit stands for media access control.\n\n548\n00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:54.220\nEvery physical network adapter and\n\n549\n00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.770\nevery wireless network\nadapter has a MAC address.\n\n550\n00:25:56.770 --> 00:26:01.000\nAnd a MAC address will uniquely identify\nyour computer on a local network.\n\n551\n00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.010\nIt doesn't work on the Internet.\n\n552\n00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:03.560\nIt's not routable address.\n\n553\n00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.690\nIt's only on the local side.\n\n554\n00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.920\nAnd it's a 48-bit hexadecimal number.\n\n555\n00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.160\nSo it's kinda like IPv6 except much\nsmaller, 48 bits instead of 128.\n\n556\n00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.190\nAnd when they manufacturer your laptop or\ndesktop, when they manufacture the dongle\n\n557\n00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:22.010\nthat is your network adapter, they\nwill burn in this MAC address into it.\n\n558\n00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.540\nAnd that identifies that adapter.\n\n559\n00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.850\nIf I were to pop this adapter off and\nstick it onto your laptop,\n\n560\n00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.300\nDaniel, you would have that same MAC.\n\n561\n00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.940\nThat media access control address\nwould follow over to your laptop.\n\n562\n00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.100\nIt is tied to the adapter.\n\n563\n00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.555\nAnd that's how you find systems on your\nown network, when you communicate.\n\n564\n00:26:37.555 --> 00:26:41.120\nThere's actually a whole process that\noccurs, called address resolution, and\n\n565\n00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.610\nyou have\nthe Address Resolution Protocol or ARP.\n\n566\n00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:44.990\nThat when you ping somebody or\n\n567\n00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:48.260\ntalk to them, the first thing you\ndo is send out this broadcast to\n\n568\n00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.170\nfind out what their MAC address is and\nyou learn it and you talk to them,.\n\n569\n00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.410\nBecause it's broadcast driven,\nit doesn't work in the Internet,\n\n570\n00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:57.540\nit only works on a local network,\nand that's what third address is.\n\n571\n00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.660\nSo, if you want to learn more about\nthis you don't necessarily need it for\n\n572\n00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.270\nthis exam.\n\n573\n00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:05.420\nBut just for your own use it\nis really good stuff to learn.\n\n574\n00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.430\nTake a look at our\nCompTIA Network+ training.\n\n575\n00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:09.720\nIt's part of the ITProTV library.\n\n576\n00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.756\nIt's part of your subscription.\n\n577\n00:27:10.756 --> 00:27:11.407\nJump over and check it out.\n\n578\n00:27:11.407 --> 00:27:15.566\nBecause we go in-depth on how these MAC\naddresses work, how IP addresses work,\n\n579\n00:27:15.566 --> 00:27:16.620\nhow they interact.\n\n580\n00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.150\nYou can learn all that\nyou want about them.\n\n581\n00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.195\nThere's a ton of information behind there.\n\n582\n00:27:20.195 --> 00:27:20.887\nBut on this exam,\n\n583\n00:27:20.887 --> 00:27:23.945\nthey really just want you to be able\nto differentiate between IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n584\n00:27:23.945 --> 00:27:27.704\n&gt;&gt; Alright, Don, a lot of interesting\nthings going on when it come to\n\n585\n00:27:27.704 --> 00:27:31.410\nnetworks and networking,\nhow our computers talk to each other.\n\n586\n00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.610\nAnd you've given us a great rundown\nof how that is working inside of our\n\n587\n00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:37.990\nMac computers running Sierra\nas the operating system.\n\n588\n00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.320\nAnd, like Don said, if that has\nwhet your appetite on networking,\n\n589\n00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.090\nman that's super interesting, definitely\njump over in our course library and\n\n590\n00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.980\ncheck out that\nCompTIA Network Plus series.\n\n591\n00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.090\nVery, very good stuff there.\n\n592\n00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.370\nThat being said, Don, looks like\nwe're out of time in this episode.\n\n593\n00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:55.190\nWe do thank you for joining us and\nlending your knowledge to us as well.\n\n594\n00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:57.100\nWe do thank our audience for watching.\n\n595\n00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:00.080\nAgain, I always hope that you\nguys get a lot out of these\n\n596\n00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.815\nseries that we create for you guys.\n\n597\n00:28:01.815 --> 00:28:03.150\nBut we are out of time for today.\n\n598\n00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.700\nWe do thank you for joining us, again.\n\n599\n00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.810\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n600\n00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:08.610\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:13.735\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n4\n00:00:13.735 --> 00:00:16.618\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.618 --> 00:00:19.547\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n6\n00:00:19.547 --> 00:00:22.216\nwe are continuing on with more\nof our ACSP series, right.\n\n7\n00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:25.965\nThe Apple Certified Support Professional,\nthat's right, hey, I got it right.\n\n8\n00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:27.322\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Joining us in the studio,\n\n9\n00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:28.900\nour good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.720\nDon, welcome back, man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.260\n&gt;&gt; It is going swell, ready to continue\non with configuring networking.\n\n12\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.330\nIn the last episode we\ntalked about networking and\n\n13\n00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.140\nhow a Mac interacts with the network,\nwhich is pretty important to us.\n\n14\n00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.590\nAnd we ran through some basic settings,\nwe really didn't configure a whole lot.\n\n15\n00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.330\nIn fact, we really kind of\nfocused on the preference\n\n16\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.550\norder of the interfaces\nthat are on the system.\n\n17\n00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.440\nSo in this episode I\nwant to double back and\n\n18\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.210\ntake a look a bit at the configuration,\nactually getting ourselves set up.\n\n19\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.015\nAnd what we'll find is that a lot of\nnetworks these days are configured to make\n\n20\n00:00:58.015 --> 00:01:02.620\nthis as easy as possible where\nwe plug in and it just works.\n\n21\n00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.690\nOld Mac slogan, right.\n\n22\n00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.050\nBut there are times where we can't go\nautomatic, where we actually do need to\n\n23\n00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.092\nget involved in the configuration\nthat connects us to the network.\n\n24\n00:01:10.092 --> 00:01:12.610\nAnd so that's what we're gonna\nbe taking a look at as we rattle\n\n25\n00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.830\nthrough our topics today.\n\n26\n00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.440\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Don,\n\n27\n00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.560\nwe kind of touched on IP communications\nin our previous episode.\n\n28\n00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.840\nMaybe we can give a little bit\nof a refresher on that and\n\n29\n00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.430\nmaybe even a little more\ndepth to it as well.\n\n30\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.360\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so one of the things that I\nmentioned very briefly in the last episode\n\n31\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.300\nwas static IP addressing and\ndynamic IP addressing.\n\n32\n00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.680\nBut I didn't really go into detail, so\nlet's revisit that and take a look at it.\n\n33\n00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.362\nI'm gonna show you guys\nhere on my laptop before,\n\n34\n00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:39.410\nit'll be easier to kinda see as we work.\n\n35\n00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.940\nBut if I go into my System Preferences,\nand I go into my network and\n\n36\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.570\nI pull up one of my network interfaces.\n\n37\n00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.020\nNow I've got two but\nyou usually have at least one.\n\n38\n00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.530\nSo I'm gonna pull up one\nof my interfaces and\n\n39\n00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.510\nI'll stick with my physical Ethernet\nconnection just for right now.\n\n40\n00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.810\nBecause on wi-fi we bring in a whole\nsecond layer of complexity with\n\n41\n00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.310\nthe wireless network itself.\n\n42\n00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.400\nWith a physical connection, we just\nplug in and we're ready to go, right?\n\n43\n00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.476\nSo on the physical side, you'll see\nright here on the main screen where it's\n\n44\n00:02:06.476 --> 00:02:08.682\nasking me to configure my IPv4 address.\n\n45\n00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:12.401\nWhich I said before is the most\ncommon type of addressing used in\n\n46\n00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:14.240\nthe entire world.\n\n47\n00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.240\nNow mine is set to be manual.\n\n48\n00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.020\nI have manually assigned an address.\n\n49\n00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.560\nNow in the official IP terminology,\nthat's called a static assignment.\n\n50\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.540\nStatic means I've manually bound\na particular IP address to this laptop.\n\n51\n00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.700\nThe reason I did that Is because I wanted\nmy laptop to have the same address\n\n52\n00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.020\nevery single day.\n\n53\n00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.580\nEvery day that I come into this office,\n\n54\n00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.490\nevery day that I work on my computers,\nI want them to have the same address.\n\n55\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.790\nIf you're running any kind of server,\n\n56\n00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.050\nyou don't want your\nserver's address to change.\n\n57\n00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.280\nYou want it to always be the same, and\n\n58\n00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.350\nyou'll normally manually assign them,\nall right?\n\n59\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.180\nBut manual assignment is not\nalways the best thing, right?\n\n60\n00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.920\nBecause of two main problems.\n\n61\n00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.180\nProblem number one, every time a new\ncomputer comes to your network,\n\n62\n00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.290\nyou've got to go and\nmanually assign an address to it.\n\n63\n00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.780\nSo anytime somebody brings an iPad,\nor an iPhone, a new laptop,\n\n64\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.900\na computer, a printer, you've got to\ngo and manually assign an address.\n\n65\n00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.980\nIt's frustrating.\n\n66\n00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.090\nAnd then two,\nit opens you up to human error.\n\n67\n00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.710\nWhen you type in an address,\nwhen you type in a subnet mask,\n\n68\n00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.660\nwhen you type in these things you can make\na typo and put something in incorrectly.\n\n69\n00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.590\nAnd when you do that,\nnow it's not going to work, right.\n\n70\n00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.800\nWorse, you could even pick an IP address\nthat's already in use by somebody else,\n\n71\n00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.410\nand now you've got a duplicate address,\nand that causes a lot of problems.\n\n72\n00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.540\nWhat really happens is one of those\ntwo devices is not gonna be able to\n\n73\n00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.520\ncommunicate right.\n\n74\n00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.010\nAnd the other device is gonna be receiving\ninformation it shouldn't be receiving.\n\n75\n00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.380\nEither scenario is bad, right?\n\n76\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.240\nNeither one is something that we want.\n\n77\n00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.680\nSo those are challenges\nwith manual assignment.\n\n78\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.590\nIt's still the best option\nwhen you've got a server.\n\n79\n00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.470\nBut on a mobile device, on a laptop, on\na desktop, even on devices where we don't\n\n80\n00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.760\nreally care about what address they have,\nthere's another option.\n\n81\n00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.000\nAnd if we drop that list down, you'll see\nwhere we can choose, Use DHCP, all right.\n\n82\n00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.910\nDHCP is\nthe Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n83\n00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.710\nAnd what it's designed is so\nthat when a new phone or tablet or\n\n84\n00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.090\nlaptop comes in on your network\nit talks to the network.\n\n85\n00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.590\nAnd it says, hey, I need an IP address,\ncan somebody help me?\n\n86\n00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.880\nAnd a DHCP server will be sitting\non the network listening.\n\n87\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.880\nIt'll hear that request and\nit'll say, hey, I can help you.\n\n88\n00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.732\nHere's an address that you can use.\n\n89\n00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:30.380\nAnd it'll give an address to that client,\nand the client can then use it and\n\n90\n00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.820\ngo about their day, right?\n\n91\n00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.030\nThe neat part about this\nis it's all automatic,\n\n92\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.490\nit all happens in the background.\n\n93\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.030\nWe don't necessarily see that, right,\nso it's kind of seamless to us.\n\n94\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.839\nAnd the end user doesn't have to know\nan IP address, a subnet mask, a router,\n\n95\n00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:46.872\nthey don't have to know all\nthis other information, right.\n\n96\n00:04:46.872 --> 00:04:48.650\nLet me show you that process.\n\n97\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.710\nSo I'm gonna revert this real quick\nback to the original settings.\n\n98\n00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.380\nAnd you've got a nice little Revert\nbutton down there that you can hit\n\n99\n00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.080\nup until the point you hit Apply.\n\n100\n00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.000\nSo I just hit Revert to put it back, and\nI'm gonna unplug that network interface.\n\n101\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.720\nSo my Thunderbolt Ethernet adaptor\nis no longer plugged in, right.\n\n102\n00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.280\nAnd if I go over here and\nI switch it to DHCP, I will try and\n\n103\n00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.365\nswitch it to DHCP, there we go.\n\n104\n00:05:10.365 --> 00:05:12.960\nAnd I'm gonna hit Apply, okay.\n\n105\n00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.890\nNow I've applied and it's set to use DHCP.\n\n106\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.800\nBut because it's unplugged,\nif it asks the network, hey,\n\n107\n00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.890\ncan somebody give me an address,\nnobody's there to answer, right?\n\n108\n00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.800\nBut when I plug that adapter back in,\nall right, so I'm gonna plug it in.\n\n109\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.570\nNow my device can talk to the network.\n\n110\n00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.640\nAnd it's gonna reach out.\n\n111\n00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.800\nWell as soon as that light turns green,\njust have to give it a moment.\n\n112\n00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.970\nBut as soon as it reaches\nout it's going to say,\n\n113\n00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.180\nhey, can somebody help me out here?\n\n114\n00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.130\nAnd somebody did.\n\n115\n00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.394\nSee how I've got 10.0.10.243?\n\n116\n00:05:43.394 --> 00:05:45.920\nI didn't type that,\nIt came from the network.\n\n117\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.840\nIt came from a DHCP server.\n\n118\n00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.414\nNow DHCP server might be\na physical server on your network.\n\n119\n00:05:50.414 --> 00:05:52.393\nBut oftentimes it's a router or\na firewall,\n\n120\n00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:54.640\nit's some other network\ndevice that you've got.\n\n121\n00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.915\nOn a home network,\nyou usually have those wireless routers.\n\n122\n00:05:57.915 --> 00:06:00.195\nAnd they do DHCP all rolled into one.\n\n123\n00:06:00.195 --> 00:06:01.195\nSo it can be any number of things.\n\n124\n00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:02.775\nBut basically we're getting\nthat dynamic address and\n\n125\n00:06:02.775 --> 00:06:04.835\nthat makes life a lot easier for us.\n\n126\n00:06:04.835 --> 00:06:07.765\n&gt;&gt; It's fun when you accidentally plug\ntwo things in that have built-in DHCP on\n\n127\n00:06:07.765 --> 00:06:08.322\nyour home network.\n\n128\n00:06:08.322 --> 00:06:10.935\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You get a great old time had by all on\n\n129\n00:06:10.935 --> 00:06:13.105\nthat one because they start\nconflicting with each other.\n\n130\n00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:16.605\nSo it can be very important to know,\nI do have a DHCP server.\n\n131\n00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:19.950\nI know what device that is and\n\n132\n00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.290\nmaybe even a little bit about\nthe addressing scheme that you're using.\n\n133\n00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.647\nSo if you see conflicts anywhere\nyou know where to look.\n\n134\n00:06:24.647 --> 00:06:28.748\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and doing a quick manual address\nis a good way to troubleshoot DHCP.\n\n135\n00:06:28.748 --> 00:06:30.330\nIs something wrong with my DHCP server?\n\n136\n00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.955\nLet me give myself a manual address and\nsee if it works now.\n\n137\n00:06:32.955 --> 00:06:33.505\nIt does!\n\n138\n00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:34.845\nOkay, somethings wrong with DHCP.\n\n139\n00:06:34.845 --> 00:06:36.505\nYou go and you figure that out.\n\n140\n00:06:36.505 --> 00:06:41.415\nNow there's a bunch of other options that\nyou'll see under here, DHCP and manually.\n\n141\n00:06:41.415 --> 00:06:42.361\nThose are the two main ones.\n\n142\n00:06:42.361 --> 00:06:44.415\nThose are the ones we need to remember for\nthe exam.\n\n143\n00:06:44.415 --> 00:06:48.005\nBut just so you know the other ones,\nUse DHCP with a manual address.\n\n144\n00:06:48.005 --> 00:06:52.322\nWell, if I choose that one, notice how I\ncan type in an IP address but subnet mask,\n\n145\n00:06:52.322 --> 00:06:54.963\nrouter and\nDNS server can't be changed, right.\n\n146\n00:06:54.963 --> 00:06:59.070\nWhat it's doing is it's saying,\nI'm gonna type in my IP.\n\n147\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.080\nI'll get everything else\nfrom the DHCP server.\n\n148\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.260\nSo this is kind of a mixture\nbetween the two options.\n\n149\n00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.710\nNot very commonly used but\nit is available.\n\n150\n00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.480\nThen you got Using BootP,\nBootP is the old Boot protocol.\n\n151\n00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.082\nAnd it was used for dummy terminals\nthat would fire up on a network and\n\n152\n00:07:14.082 --> 00:07:16.102\nthey didn't have their operating system,\nright.\n\n153\n00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.277\nThey would actually reach\nout on the network and say,\n\n154\n00:07:18.277 --> 00:07:22.140\nhey, not only do I need an IP address,\nI kinda need an operating system, too.\n\n155\n00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.290\nAnd we'd find a BootP server that would\nthen send us an image of the operating\n\n156\n00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.120\nsystem over the network so you could boot.\n\n157\n00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.050\nNot many people make use of that,\nvoice over IP phones use it like crazy, so\n\n158\n00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.110\nyou do see it there.\n\n159\n00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.920\nBut as far as our Macs,\nit's not something you would typically do.\n\n160\n00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.442\nThe operating system is here on our Macs.\n\n161\n00:07:38.442 --> 00:07:40.545\nThen you'll see Off,\nI can just turn the adapter off,\n\n162\n00:07:40.545 --> 00:07:43.600\nwhich means I'm not gonna use it,\nthat's not terribly useful here.\n\n163\n00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.804\nAnd then Create a PPPoE Service.\n\n164\n00:07:45.804 --> 00:07:48.331\nIf I'm plugging into a cable modem or\na DSL modem,\n\n165\n00:07:48.331 --> 00:07:52.076\nit might be requiring me to do\npoint-to-point protocol over Ethernet.\n\n166\n00:07:52.076 --> 00:07:54.476\nAnd the main reason for\nthat is authentication, right?\n\n167\n00:07:54.476 --> 00:07:57.132\nIf it's a pay service to connect.\n\n168\n00:07:57.132 --> 00:07:58.663\nThen they want me to\nprovide a username and\n\n169\n00:07:58.663 --> 00:08:01.527\npassword to show what account that I am\non and then they make sure they bill me.\n\n170\n00:08:01.527 --> 00:08:04.690\nSo that's what we usually see right there.\n\n171\n00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.550\nAll right, but for the most part, DHCP and\n\n172\n00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.070\nmanually, those are the two options\nthat we are going to leverage.\n\n173\n00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.481\nAnd you will remember that I\nwas using the manual here,\n\n174\n00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:15.610\nif I can remember what\naddress I assigned myself.\n\n175\n00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.870\nI think I'll use that one.\n\n176\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.910\nSo I can just put that right back, and\nnow I have that manual address applied.\n\n177\n00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.880\nAnd Don, we do have all of\nthese features available for\n\n178\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.420\nthe IP version 6 protocol as well?\n\n179\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.871\n&gt;&gt; We do, but\nit's a little bit different, right?\n\n180\n00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:31.810\nSo if I go under advanced, inside of\nmy advanced settings I see my TCPIP and\n\n181\n00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.746\neverything I was just\nconfiguring was IPv4, right?\n\n182\n00:08:34.746 --> 00:08:40.310\nIf I look at IPv6,\nit's set to Automatically.\n\n183\n00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:41.090\n&gt;&gt; Auto magically.\n\n184\n00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.800\n&gt;&gt; Why do they call it\nautomatically instead of DHCP?\n\n185\n00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.044\nTechnically DHCP is not\nrequired under IPv6.\n\n186\n00:08:47.044 --> 00:08:50.600\nIt has its own address discovery system\nthat's built into it that you'll\n\n187\n00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.670\ntypically use.\n\n188\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.980\nSo it has what's called a stateless\nauto configuration, and\n\n189\n00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.160\nit's built into the IPv6 protocol.\n\n190\n00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.937\nBut if that doesn't work,\nthere is actually a DHCPv6.\n\n191\n00:09:00.937 --> 00:09:04.240\nYou can have a DHP server\non an IPv6 network.\n\n192\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.566\nSo when you choose automatically here,\nyou're actually enabling both,\n\n193\n00:09:07.566 --> 00:09:09.530\nstateless auto configuration and DHPv6.\n\n194\n00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.653\nAnd it will try stateless auto\nconfig first and if it fails,\n\n195\n00:09:12.653 --> 00:09:14.060\nthen it will use DHCPv6.\n\n196\n00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:20.504\nBut that's effectively the same option\nas what we saw on IPv4 called DHCP.\n\n197\n00:09:20.504 --> 00:09:23.658\nWe've got manually, so I can come in and\nI can manually type in\n\n198\n00:09:23.658 --> 00:09:27.330\nthe address that I wanna use and\nthe router and the prefix length.\n\n199\n00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.746\nPrefix length is a different term for\nyour subnet mask.\n\n200\n00:09:32.746 --> 00:09:36.962\nSubnet masks, if you're not familiar with\nthem, they identify which part of your\n\n201\n00:09:36.962 --> 00:09:41.140\naddress is the network ID, and\nwhich part of the address is the host ID.\n\n202\n00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:41.860\nSo for example,\n\n203\n00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:47.190\nif you look at my subnet mask here where\nthe 255s are, that's my network ID.\n\n204\n00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.511\nIt's telling me that my network is 10.0.\n\n205\n00:09:49.511 --> 00:09:54.292\nAnd then I've got .0.0,\nthat's telling me the last two numbers,\n\n206\n00:09:54.292 --> 00:09:57.360\n222.221, that's my host ID.\n\n207\n00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.730\nNow why is that important?\n\n208\n00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.840\nWell, anybody who's on the same network as\nme, so anybody here in the building whose\n\n209\n00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.320\naddress starts with 10.0 would\nbe in the same network as me.\n\n210\n00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.890\nI can talk directly to them.\n\n211\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.890\nBut if anybody is on a different network,\nlike 10.1 or 192.168 or something like\n\n212\n00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:17.590\nthat, they're not on the same network\nas me, I have to go through a router.\n\n213\n00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.960\nThis subnet mark is how we\nknow when to go to a router\n\n214\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.470\nversus when we can talk direct.\n\n215\n00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.720\nKind of important.\n\n216\n00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.500\nWell, if this subnet mask was converted\ninto binary bits, this would actually be\n\n217\n00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.120\neight ones followed by a period, followed\nby eight more ones followed by a period,\n\n218\n00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.990\nand then a zero or eight zeroes and\nthen eight more zeroes.\n\n219\n00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:40.820\nSo if I have eight ones followed by\neight ones, that's a total of 16 ones.\n\n220\n00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.693\nAnd if I were to represent this is as\na prefix instead of as a subnet mask,\n\n221\n00:10:44.693 --> 00:10:47.097\nit would be represented as /16, right?\n\n222\n00:10:47.097 --> 00:10:49.790\nYou're representing a number\nof ones that are in there.\n\n223\n00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.930\nWell, IPv6 addresses are so\nbig that if you were to try and\n\n224\n00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:58.360\ndo that 255 type notation,\nit would be really, really long.\n\n225\n00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.640\nFirst, it would FFF because of the\nhexadecimal instead of regular decimal,\n\n226\n00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.770\nbut it would be really long.\n\n227\n00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.370\nSo they just do a prefix length,\nand that's it.\n\n228\n00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.490\nSo they make me punch it in that way.\n\n229\n00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.930\nSo it's a different way\nof representing that.\n\n230\n00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.510\n&gt;&gt; And Don, really quickly,\nwe have a question from our chat room.\n\n231\n00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.430\nGeorge is asking, should we\nenable IPv6 on our home networks?\n\n232\n00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:19.940\nIs there an advantage to that?\n\n233\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.100\n&gt;&gt; So the funny answer there is,\nyou probably already have.\n\n234\n00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.520\nIf you have a Mac that you're running, and\nyou're running, I think they started with,\n\n235\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.670\nI feel like it was Snow Leopard\nthat they started with,\n\n236\n00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.960\nwhere IPv6 is enabled by default.\n\n237\n00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.880\nSo you probably already have it,\ndefinitely if you're running Mavericks,\n\n238\n00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.590\nYosemite, El Capitan,\nall of our newer ones,\n\n239\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.360\nthey all have IPv6 turned on by default.\n\n240\n00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.995\nSo you very likely are already running it,\nif you have an Apple TV, Rokus,\n\n241\n00:11:49.995 --> 00:11:51.950\nXboxes, Playstations.\n\n242\n00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.080\nSony was one of the first companies\nto enable IPv6 by default.\n\n243\n00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.690\nSo the odds are, inside your\nhome you're already running it.\n\n244\n00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.770\nThe only place you really need to\nmake that decision is on your router,\n\n245\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:01.610\nall right.\n\n246\n00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:07.000\nYour router connects to your ISP, and\nyour ISP may or may not support IPv6.\n\n247\n00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.983\nSo for example, our ISP here for\nour building doesn't support IPv6 yet.\n\n248\n00:12:12.983 --> 00:12:15.750\nThey've got it like in a beta program or\nsomething, but they don't support it.\n\n249\n00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.820\nSo if I run IPv6 here inside the building,\nit's fine.\n\n250\n00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.500\nBut as soon as I go to the Internet, I've\ngot to be in IPv4 to get out there, right?\n\n251\n00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.990\nSo that's really where we end up.\n\n252\n00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.340\nAnd most people deploy what's called\na dual-stack solution where you're\n\n253\n00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.920\nrunning IPv4 and\nIPv6 side by side at the same time.\n\n254\n00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.720\nAnd one day all of our stuff\nwill be moved over to IPv6, and\n\n255\n00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.910\nthen you can just go in and shut off IPv4.\n\n256\n00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.480\nBut it is perfectly safe to turn on IPv6.\n\n257\n00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.170\nDo be aware, that if you've got firewalls\nand other things that are in place,\n\n258\n00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:46.190\nthat you need to be protecting\nIPv6 just like you do IPv4.\n\n259\n00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.529\nSo if you created a bunch of\nfirewall rules under IPv4,\n\n260\n00:12:49.529 --> 00:12:51.384\ndo the same thing under IPv6.\n\n261\n00:12:51.384 --> 00:12:54.758\nSome people forget that and\nthey really secure IPv4 and\n\n262\n00:12:54.758 --> 00:12:58.270\nleave IPv6 wide open.That would be bad,\nright?\n\n263\n00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.942\nBut if it's just internal,\nthen it doesnt really matter.\n\n264\n00:13:00.942 --> 00:13:03.443\nIf you are at home,\nthen it doesn't matter.\n\n265\n00:13:03.443 --> 00:13:07.675\nBut if you're in an office and you've\ngot 1,000 employees, you get an internal\n\n266\n00:13:07.675 --> 00:13:11.700\nattacker, and if IPv6 is not secure,\nthen they could really roam the network.\n\n267\n00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.690\nAnd that wouldn't be a good thing.\n\n268\n00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.620\nAll right, so I've got manual,\nI've got automatic.\n\n269\n00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.939\nAnd there is one other option here,\nwhich is link-local only.\n\n270\n00:13:20.939 --> 00:13:24.940\nI mentioned how IPv6 is turned on by\ndefault for a lot of people, right?\n\n271\n00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:30.300\nIf you're not using IPv6, it's actually\nrunning in a link-local only mode.\n\n272\n00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:35.420\nIPv6 always generates at least one\ndynamic address for your system.\n\n273\n00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.300\nAnd it's used for\n\n274\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.370\ntalking to other computers right\nthere on the network with you.\n\n275\n00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:44.320\nAnd it's really easy to spot that because\na link local address will typically\n\n276\n00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.410\nstart with FE8, or\nFE80 is what you'll normally see.\n\n277\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.210\nTechnically, it can start with,\nlet's see f, d,\n\n278\n00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:58.040\nall the way through ff ,I think is\nthe range that's kind of reserved for it.\n\n279\n00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.350\nBut what you'll normally see\nis fe80 followed by whatever.\n\n280\n00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:08.008\nSo if I were to drop to my terminal,\nfor example, and run a ifconfig,\n\n281\n00:14:08.008 --> 00:14:13.340\nimport my interfaces,\nI have not configured IPv6 on this laptop.\n\n282\n00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.983\nBut if I look here,\nI can see I do have an IPv6 address\n\n283\n00:14:17.983 --> 00:14:22.944\nfe80 : : that's telling me\nthis is a link local, and\n\n284\n00:14:22.944 --> 00:14:28.118\nthen it's followed by\na dynamically generated address,\n\n285\n00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:32.677\nthis 41e:3070:dad0:757, right?\n\n286\n00:14:32.677 --> 00:14:35.796\nThat's what's being dynamically generated\nfrom my network interface, right?\n\n287\n00:14:35.796 --> 00:14:38.745\nSome of the other things I'll\nsee on this line, for example,\n\n288\n00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:40.120\nhere's my prefix length.\n\n289\n00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.915\nMy prefix length is 64.\n\n290\n00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:45.057\nIPv6 is a 128 bit address, so\n\n291\n00:14:45.057 --> 00:14:48.894\nthis is telling me the first\n64 bits identify my network.\n\n292\n00:14:48.894 --> 00:14:52.101\nBut the first half of the address,\nso if I divide my address in half,\n\n293\n00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:54.820\nthe left side is the network,\nthe right side is the host.\n\n294\n00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.260\nSo that's how prefix links work.\n\n295\n00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.300\nAnd then you'll see this %en3,\nthat's just called the zone identifier.\n\n296\n00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.590\nAnd this definitely won't be on the exam,\nbut just so you know for real life land,\n\n297\n00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:09.680\nin IPv6, you can have one address tied\nto more than one interface, right?\n\n298\n00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.730\nAnd that can create some\nconfusion in the system, so\n\n299\n00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.420\nit's gotta be able to keep track of that.\n\n300\n00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:17.030\nAnd so you'll have one address with\ndifferent zones attached to it.\n\n301\n00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.300\nSo it knows, okay,\n\n302\n00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.570\nthis is the address as it's represented\nwhen connected to interface EM3 and\n\n303\n00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.770\nhere's the address as it's represented\nwhen it's connected to EM2.\n\n304\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.120\nOr whatever your wireless one is and\nso on.\n\n305\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.830\nSo you'll see different things like that.\n\n306\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.900\nAnd I have got a tunnel up here\nthat's doing the same thing, and\n\n307\n00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.290\nyou will see that pop\nup from time to time.\n\n308\n00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.800\nNot on the exam, but\nsomething worth knowing.\n\n309\n00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.740\nYou see this under Windows and\nunder Linux, Unix.\n\n310\n00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.258\nIt's all the same because\nIPv6 is a standard protocol.\n\n311\n00:15:44.258 --> 00:15:47.000\nSo if you've done it on one,\nit's kind of the same on all the others.\n\n312\n00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.770\nAll right, couple other things\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n313\n00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.942\nWith DHCP, we get most of our\nconfiguration automatically, and\n\n314\n00:15:53.942 --> 00:15:54.697\nthat's nice.\n\n315\n00:15:54.697 --> 00:15:57.457\nBut if we look at each of the entries,\nlike if I wanted to do it manually,\n\n316\n00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:58.985\nwe need to understand what each one is.\n\n317\n00:15:58.985 --> 00:16:01.408\nI've already talked about\nthe subnet mask and what it does.\n\n318\n00:16:01.408 --> 00:16:04.224\nThe router is another one\nthat's really important.\n\n319\n00:16:04.224 --> 00:16:08.027\nIn the Mac world we call it a router,\nin the Linux world its called the gateway,\n\n320\n00:16:08.027 --> 00:16:10.924\nin the Windows world its called\na default gateway, right?\n\n321\n00:16:10.924 --> 00:16:12.327\nSo there's a few different terms,\n\n322\n00:16:12.327 --> 00:16:14.301\nCisco likes to call it\nthe gateway of last resort.\n\n323\n00:16:14.301 --> 00:16:16.290\nThere's all sorts of weird words for\nthis one.\n\n324\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:17.640\nBut ultimately it's a router.\n\n325\n00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.170\nIt's the router we use to get to any\nnetwork we're not directly connected to.\n\n326\n00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.558\nSo when I look at my subnet mask,\nand it tells me my network is 10.0,\n\n327\n00:16:24.558 --> 00:16:27.041\nif I wanna talk to anybody else,\nany other address or\n\n328\n00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:30.383\nsearch something other than 10.0,\nI'm gonna go to this router.\n\n329\n00:16:30.383 --> 00:16:31.884\nSo I need to punch that in.\n\n330\n00:16:31.884 --> 00:16:33.532\nWhat if you have more than one router?\n\n331\n00:16:33.532 --> 00:16:34.168\nWell too bad.\n\n332\n00:16:34.168 --> 00:16:36.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can only have one entry here.\n\n333\n00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.940\nIt only supports one gateway.\n\n334\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.970\nNow you might have a gateway\nassigned to one interface, and\n\n335\n00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.010\na different gateway assigned\nto another interface.\n\n336\n00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.130\nYou can do that.\n\n337\n00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:48.420\nBut at the end of the day,\nwhichever interface is at the top of this\n\n338\n00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.620\nlist on the left side, that's the one\nwhose router you're gonna use.\n\n339\n00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.318\nSo in my case it will use\nwhatever router is attached\n\n340\n00:16:54.318 --> 00:16:58.800\nto my Thunderbolt Ethernet configuration\nand not WiFi or one of the others, right?\n\n341\n00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.300\nThe other settings that we see here,\n[COUGH] are things like DNS and\n\n342\n00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.920\nsearch domains, right?\n\n343\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.544\nName lookups are really important to\ngiving people a good user experience.\n\n344\n00:17:08.544 --> 00:17:09.952\nWhen you browse the Internet, right?\n\n345\n00:17:09.952 --> 00:17:14.548\nAnd if I fire up Safari and I wanna go\nto Apple's webpage, so what do I do?\n\n346\n00:17:14.548 --> 00:17:19.468\nI fire up my web browser,\nI open up a tab, and I type apple.com or\n\n347\n00:17:19.468 --> 00:17:23.308\nwww.apple.com if we're trapped in 1997.\n\n348\n00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:26.570\nSo you type whatever it is you\nwanna do to get to Apple website.\n\n349\n00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:27.509\nThat's easy to remember.\n\n350\n00:17:27.509 --> 00:17:28.796\nApple.com, got it.\n\n351\n00:17:28.796 --> 00:17:31.180\n&gt;&gt; And lucky for\nus inspiration is now in session.\n\n352\n00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can see that we have\nsome kind of event going on today.\n\n353\n00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:38.140\nSo I, everybody points at\nthe lady who drew herself.\n\n354\n00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.590\nSo that's easy, that's what users expect.\n\n355\n00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.080\nBut the computer doesn't need a name.\n\n356\n00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.620\nThe computer needs an IP address.\n\n357\n00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.710\nIt needs to know who to talk to.\n\n358\n00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.694\nI need to talk to this server,\nhow do I get to it, right?\n\n359\n00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:54.041\nAnd so in the background it's\nreaching out to a name server, and\n\n360\n00:17:54.041 --> 00:17:58.162\nthe name server is responsible for\nconverting names to IPs.\n\n361\n00:17:58.162 --> 00:18:01.651\nAnd so when I look at my network\nconfiguration back here,\n\n362\n00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:05.512\nwhat I'm seeing are the name\nservers that I'm using, right?\n\n363\n00:18:05.512 --> 00:18:07.570\nAnd you may use ones that\nare different than me.\n\n364\n00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.500\nThese are actually ones that\nare provided by Google.\n\n365\n00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.710\nMany ISPs provide their own, or\n\n366\n00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:17.408\nyour IT Department might have DNS\nservers internal for your company.\n\n367\n00:18:17.408 --> 00:18:19.261\nSo you wanna use whatever's\nappropriate there, and\n\n368\n00:18:19.261 --> 00:18:20.714\nyou might get them from DHCP or whatever.\n\n369\n00:18:20.714 --> 00:18:25.225\nBut if we go into advanced, inside of the\nadvanced settings DNS has it's own tab and\n\n370\n00:18:25.225 --> 00:18:27.303\nyou can define your servers, right?\n\n371\n00:18:27.303 --> 00:18:30.820\nNow you can put in as\nmany servers as you want.\n\n372\n00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.950\nI actually don't know what the total\nlimit is, but you can go crazy and\n\n373\n00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:39.420\njust start punch them in, use a little\nplus sign and add as many as you want.\n\n374\n00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:44.120\nAll right, the idea here is redundancy if\none fails you can use the other, okay?\n\n375\n00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.360\nBut don't go crazy with this,\n\n376\n00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.820\nbecause in reality you're always\ngoing to use the very first one.\n\n377\n00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.420\nThat's it.\n\n378\n00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:56.050\nMine's gonna use 8.8.8.8 all the time,\nunless it fails.\n\n379\n00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:00.352\nIf it fails,\nthen it will go to 8.8.4.4 right?\n\n380\n00:19:00.352 --> 00:19:05.691\nBut unless both of them have failed,\nit won't go to 4.2.2.1, right?\n\n381\n00:19:05.691 --> 00:19:08.390\nIt won't go down the list until\neverything above it has failed.\n\n382\n00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.850\nSo usually two is more than enough.\n\n383\n00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.120\nIf you can't get to either\nof your DNS servers,\n\n384\n00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.820\nlikely you've got some kind\nof network issue going on.\n\n385\n00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.190\nIt won't matter if you\nhave 50 servers here,\n\n386\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.600\nyou won't be able to get to any of them.\n\n387\n00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.470\nSo don't go crazy on this, but\n\n388\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.990\nit is a good idea to put in DNS\nservers at least two, and hopefully\n\n389\n00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:26.400\nones that are on different subnets,\nbecause you could have a routing problem.\n\n390\n00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.631\nWhat if a routing problem happens and\nI just can't get to 8.8?\n\n391\n00:19:28.631 --> 00:19:30.984\nWell then I wouldn't be able\nto get to either of these two.\n\n392\n00:19:30.984 --> 00:19:34.319\nSo it would be nice to have 8.8.8 and\nthen follow that up\n\n393\n00:19:34.319 --> 00:19:39.202\nwith something like 4.2.2.1,\ntwo completely different companies, right?\n\n394\n00:19:39.202 --> 00:19:42.427\nWe've got Google here and\nlevel three communications here or quest,\n\n395\n00:19:42.427 --> 00:19:43.583\nquest communications.\n\n396\n00:19:43.583 --> 00:19:44.413\nWhoever, Century Link.\n\n397\n00:19:44.413 --> 00:19:45.232\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] One of those guys.\n\n398\n00:19:45.232 --> 00:19:49.150\n&gt;&gt; Well they get bought out, they change\nthe names, who knows, so whoever that is.\n\n399\n00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.120\nNow originally it was GE, right?\n\n400\n00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.545\nThe General Electric's online stuff,\nbut whatever.\n\n401\n00:19:53.545 --> 00:19:55.000\nSo we, [LAUGH] have these two.\n\n402\n00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.552\nNow there is also a search domain.\n\n403\n00:19:57.552 --> 00:20:00.482\nWhen I fired up my web browser and\nI typed in an address,\n\n404\n00:20:00.482 --> 00:20:02.351\nI might type in apple.com right?\n\n405\n00:20:02.351 --> 00:20:05.005\nAnd it knows I wanna go to Apple, right?\n\n406\n00:20:05.005 --> 00:20:08.398\nLike www.apple.com, but\nwhat if I just type www and that's it,\n\n407\n00:20:08.398 --> 00:20:10.960\nmy presenter I don't type the rest of it.\n\n408\n00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.690\nWell it's gonna get an error, but\n\n409\n00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.640\nif I have internal domains,\nI could come in and add them.\n\n410\n00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:22.970\nSo I could have like ITPRO.TV and now if\nI do a DNS look up for mail, just mail.\n\n411\n00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.750\nWhen it goes to look it up, it will say,\n\n412\n00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:29.940\nwell I can't find that it's just a word\nbut if I stick ITPRO.TV on the end of it,\n\n413\n00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:34.250\nI can look for mail.itpro.tv and\nnow I might get something back.\n\n414\n00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.870\nAnd you can add more search\ndomains if you want.\n\n415\n00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.831\nI don't normally populate anything\nhere and you saw mine was empty,\n\n416\n00:20:39.831 --> 00:20:42.344\nbecause this is really for\nwhen we make mistakes, right?\n\n417\n00:20:42.344 --> 00:20:43.048\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n418\n00:20:43.048 --> 00:20:43.702\n&gt;&gt; And if you don't\n\n419\n00:20:43.702 --> 00:20:46.788\nmake mistakes you don't need it, but\nthere are times where we have software or\n\n420\n00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:49.903\napplications they expect to be able to\ndo what's called a single name lookup.\n\n421\n00:20:49.903 --> 00:20:54.106\nWhen they're not looking for\nprinter.itpro.tv, they're just looking for\n\n422\n00:20:54.106 --> 00:20:58.244\nprinter and you can use search domains to\nhelp find and resolve that address and\n\n423\n00:20:58.244 --> 00:20:59.580\npopulate this in.\n\n424\n00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.530\nOften times you will get those from DHCP,\nso you won't have to enter them yourself.\n\n425\n00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:04.883\nAll right.\n\n426\n00:21:04.883 --> 00:21:06.297\n&gt;&gt; Continuing on with more DNS.\n\n427\n00:21:06.297 --> 00:21:10.464\nThere's a lot going on with a DNS and\nif we don't have it, we're kind of like,\n\n428\n00:21:10.464 --> 00:21:14.758\nlike we said, I like to type in apple.com\nbecause remembering the IP address for\n\n429\n00:21:14.758 --> 00:21:16.860\nApple is basically impossible for me.\n\n430\n00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Along with litany of other websites\n\n431\n00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:19.780\nthat I go to.\n\n432\n00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.092\nBut how was that done?\n\n433\n00:21:21.092 --> 00:21:25.333\nHow does DNS go,\nwell this is apple.com's IP address?\n\n434\n00:21:25.333 --> 00:21:25.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n435\n00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.580\nthere is a whole process that goes on\nin the background when you do a lookup.\n\n436\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.080\nAnd there's actually more than\njust DNS servers involved.\n\n437\n00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.742\nLet me show you guys the network utility,\n\n438\n00:21:32.742 --> 00:21:34.697\nI'm gonna get out of\nthe screen here real quick.\n\n439\n00:21:34.697 --> 00:21:36.526\nLet me just apply that.\n\n440\n00:21:36.526 --> 00:21:39.721\nAnd if you browse in your application\nfolder and go into ytilities, or\n\n441\n00:21:39.721 --> 00:21:41.888\nyou just use your spotlight\nlike I'm about to,\n\n442\n00:21:41.888 --> 00:21:45.813\nthere's a program that's included with\nmacOS that's called the Network Utility.\n\n443\n00:21:45.813 --> 00:21:47.657\nAnd when you fire up the network utility,\n\n444\n00:21:47.657 --> 00:21:51.239\nit's got a bunch of different things that\nyou can work with like netstat, ping,\n\n445\n00:21:51.239 --> 00:21:54.140\nlookup, traceroute, whois,\nfinger and port scan.\n\n446\n00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.730\nAnd each one performs\na slightly different function.\n\n447\n00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:01.300\nSome of these are tied to DNS,\nspecifically lookup and whois.\n\n448\n00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.820\nThese are two commands that\nare really useful when it comes to\n\n449\n00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.100\ntroubleshooting issues with DNS and\nmaking sure things are working.\n\n450\n00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.360\nAlright, when we do a lookup,\na lookup is saying I've got a name,\n\n451\n00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.480\nI need to get an address.\n\n452\n00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.713\nSo if I come in and I type in like\nwww.apple.com and I do a lookup,\n\n453\n00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:24.394\nit's gonna reach out to my DNS server and\nget me an answer.\n\n454\n00:22:24.394 --> 00:22:27.534\nAnd who's my DNS server, well, 8.8.8.8.\n\n455\n00:22:27.534 --> 00:22:29.352\nWe typed that in just a moment ago.\n\n456\n00:22:29.352 --> 00:22:32.266\nAnd so it reached out to that server and\nit said, hey here's this name.\n\n457\n00:22:32.266 --> 00:22:34.252\nCan you tell me who the address is, right?\n\n458\n00:22:34.252 --> 00:22:35.660\nAnd it goes and it does that lookup.\n\n459\n00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.220\nNow the DNS server on the backend is\nnavigating through this whole DNS\n\n460\n00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.210\nhierarchy, through top level domains and\n\n461\n00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:45.130\nfinding the Apple server, reaching out\nto Apple, getting the answer for www.\n\n462\n00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.230\nAnd ultimately presenting me with\na single IP address that I can reach\n\n463\n00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:49.520\nout and talk to.\n\n464\n00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.510\nBut I don't see all that stuff that's\ngoing on behind the scenes, right?\n\n465\n00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.873\nLike it had to figure out where the Apple\nservers were, and that's what Whois does.\n\n466\n00:22:56.873 --> 00:23:01.553\nIf I jump over to whois, we can come and\ntake a look at apple.com, and\n\n467\n00:23:01.553 --> 00:23:03.671\nit can run a whois lookup on it.\n\n468\n00:23:03.671 --> 00:23:07.090\nAnd it can figure out where\nthat one is actually hosted,\n\n469\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.726\nand what you'll see as the list\nkind of populates out here,\n\n470\n00:23:10.726 --> 00:23:15.696\nis all the different stuff that's involved\nin the registration of that domain.\n\n471\n00:23:15.696 --> 00:23:20.055\nAnd you'll see where Apple\nhas tied themselves to\n\n472\n00:23:20.055 --> 00:23:24.737\na number of different things,\nwhat is all this mess?\n\n473\n00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:26.481\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n474\n00:23:26.481 --> 00:23:27.148\n&gt;&gt; So anyhow,\n\n475\n00:23:27.148 --> 00:23:30.360\nit's showing basically a list\nof different registers.\n\n476\n00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.190\nNormally it just shows the registrar,\nthe register with Apple.\n\n477\n00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.702\nThey actually have a really,\n\n478\n00:23:34.702 --> 00:23:37.613\nreally old registration from\nway back in the beginning.\n\n479\n00:23:37.613 --> 00:23:42.141\nAnd so apparently they've managed\nto get tied to more than one thing,\n\n480\n00:23:42.141 --> 00:23:47.532\nalthough some of this looks I mean look\nat this, like was owned by Microsoft.com.\n\n481\n00:23:47.532 --> 00:23:50.610\nIt's doing a lookup for any domain that\nstarted with Apple.com is what its done.\n\n482\n00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.670\nSo it hasn't limited\nto just the Apple.com.\n\n483\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.413\nAll of these,\nthese are actually not Apple records.\n\n484\n00:23:55.413 --> 00:23:58.673\nIf I get down here,\nthis is the actual Apple record and\n\n485\n00:23:58.673 --> 00:24:02.954\nso it wasn't able to give me the exact\nresult that I wanted on this one.\n\n486\n00:24:02.954 --> 00:24:04.618\nLet's take somebody who's not screwed up.\n\n487\n00:24:04.618 --> 00:24:06.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we'll do like ITProTV.\n\n488\n00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.648\nSo we do a lookup here this\none should be a lot cleaner.\n\n489\n00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:10.210\nNo match.\n\n490\n00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right well that doesn't help us.\n\n491\n00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.394\nI know why we don't have a match,\nit's .TV domain.\n\n492\n00:24:15.394 --> 00:24:17.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; .TV is actually a country code,\n\n493\n00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.460\nthe country of Tuvalu right?\n\n494\n00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:19.970\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n495\n00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nthat's not controlled by Internet,\n\n496\n00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.400\nthat's controlled by\nthe country of Tuvalu.\n\n497\n00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.950\nSo this whois lookup failed.\n\n498\n00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:30.410\nAnd you'll see there's different\nplaces that you can do lookups against\n\n499\n00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.710\nto find the answers that\nyou're looking for.\n\n500\n00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.581\nSo anyhow, you can figure out where\nit's registered, and reach out.\n\n501\n00:24:35.581 --> 00:24:39.190\nGet more information about the domain,\nand pull the information back.\n\n502\n00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.802\nSo that's really what's\ngoing on behind the scenes.\n\n503\n00:24:41.802 --> 00:24:46.160\nThere is also a local cache though,\nyou're caching information for DNS lookup.\n\n504\n00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.620\nSo that if you've already done the lookup,\n\n505\n00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.600\nyou can just use the information\nthat you've got cached.\n\n506\n00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.450\nYou pull it from there and\noff it goes, that's helps too.\n\n507\n00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:57.617\nIf you wanna see more about DNS, there's\na terminal utility you can use called dig.\n\n508\n00:24:57.617 --> 00:25:02.490\nDig is actually a part of\nthe BSD Unix distribution, and\n\n509\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.080\nso it's included inside of Mac OS.\n\n510\n00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.660\nAnd it can show you all\nsorts of information.\n\n511\n00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.545\nLike if you just run dig by itself,\n\n512\n00:25:10.545 --> 00:25:13.542\nit'll show you what are called\nthe root hint servers.\n\n513\n00:25:13.542 --> 00:25:17.680\nIf you go to do a lookup,\nyou've got to start somewhere.\n\n514\n00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.995\nAnd you'll go to your DNS server Server,\nand then it will reach up to these,\n\n515\n00:25:19.995 --> 00:25:21.195\nwhat are called root hint servers.\n\n516\n00:25:21.195 --> 00:25:25.136\nAnd they'll say, all right, who's\nresponsible for registering .com, or .tv,\n\n517\n00:25:25.136 --> 00:25:25.749\nor whoever?\n\n518\n00:25:25.749 --> 00:25:29.085\nAnd then they go to that zone, and\nthey say, all right, where is Apple,\n\n519\n00:25:29.085 --> 00:25:29.975\nor where is IT Pro?\n\n520\n00:25:29.975 --> 00:25:32.385\nAnd then they go to the server and\nthey get the final answer.\n\n521\n00:25:32.385 --> 00:25:36.048\nSo if I do a dig of itpro.tv,\n\n522\n00:25:36.048 --> 00:25:40.580\nI see a little bit more information about\nthat lookup process that went through.\n\n523\n00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.200\nI can see which server\nI looked up against.\n\n524\n00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.540\nAnd I can see the result that we\ngot back for that entry, right?\n\n525\n00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.720\nAnd what's cool,\nis it's easy to influence and\n\n526\n00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.080\nchange things like which server\nthat I'm connecting to, and so on.\n\n527\n00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.420\nIf you're on dig --help,\n\n528\n00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.720\nyou'll see some of the different\ncommand line options you can specify.\n\n529\n00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.470\nFor example, you can specify\nthe server that you wanna tie to or\n\n530\n00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.220\nthe other information you\nwanna look it up against.\n\n531\n00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.300\nAnd there's just a wealth\nof things you can do there.\n\n532\n00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.470\nThere's the older nslookup utility,\nwhich is being phased out, but\n\n533\n00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:14.310\nit's still there too.\n\n534\n00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.189\nAnd so I can do a lookup for itpro.tv, but\n\n535\n00:26:16.189 --> 00:26:18.411\nyou'll see it shows\na little less information.\n\n536\n00:26:18.411 --> 00:26:23.002\nThere's a way to increase its robusity and\nsee more, but dig does it automatically,\n\n537\n00:26:23.002 --> 00:26:25.891\nso I normally use dig for\ndoing these kind of lookups.\n\n538\n00:26:25.891 --> 00:26:28.090\nAll right, let's see what else to know.\n\n539\n00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.420\nI wanna mention here before\nwe wrap this one up.\n\n540\n00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:35.010\nA couple of other things that we need to\nbe aware of is there are advanced settings\n\n541\n00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.970\ntied to a lot of these network adaptors?\n\n542\n00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:41.210\nIf I go back into my System Preferences,\nand I go back into Network,\n\n543\n00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.870\nwhen we take a look at something\nlike an Ethernet connection, right?\n\n544\n00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:48.910\nI saw where I had router,\ngateway, and so on.\n\n545\n00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:51.860\nBut if we go back into advanced,\nthere was a lot more in here.\n\n546\n00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.740\nRight, I have been talking about DNS,\nbut what are these other tabs?\n\n547\n00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.644\nSo let's run through these real quick,\n\n548\n00:26:56.644 --> 00:27:00.120\nI didn't get to wireless we will have\nto do that in part three, I guess.\n\n549\n00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.110\nLet me at least hit these here,\nand we will wrap this episode up.\n\n550\n00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.967\nThe first tab was setting the address,\nIPv4 and\n\n551\n00:27:05.967 --> 00:27:09.600\nIPv6, the second tab is setting DNS,\nso we talked about those.\n\n552\n00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.705\nThe third tab is 802.1x.\n\n553\n00:27:12.705 --> 00:27:15.909\nAnd 802.1x is a network\nauthentication mechanism, right?\n\n554\n00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:20.454\nIf I have a secure facility, and maybe one\nday we move somebody's desk to a different\n\n555\n00:27:20.454 --> 00:27:25.630\nlocation in their office, and now there's\nan exposed network jack on the wall.\n\n556\n00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.580\nAnybody could come along with a laptop and\n\n557\n00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.690\nplug into that network jack in the wall\nand now they're on my network, right?\n\n558\n00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.064\nNot if we use Ava 2.1X.\n\n559\n00:27:32.064 --> 00:27:37.441\nWith Ava 2.1X, you issue a certificate to\nevery approved device on your network.\n\n560\n00:27:37.441 --> 00:27:40.439\nAnd the certificate resides as\npart of the Operating System.\n\n561\n00:27:40.439 --> 00:27:44.300\nAnd if an unauthorized laptop comes in and\nthey plug into a wall jack,\n\n562\n00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.910\nif they don't have a certificate, it\ndoesn't even let them talk on the network.\n\n563\n00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:51.810\nThey can't get DHCP address,\nthey can't communicate, they're\n\n564\n00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:56.030\ncompletely blocked off from the network,\nit's a great way of securing things.\n\n565\n00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.334\nMost networks don't do this at home,\nyou definitely don't do this.\n\n566\n00:27:58.334 --> 00:28:01.331\nBut if you work for\nthe government, the military,\n\n567\n00:28:01.331 --> 00:28:05.460\nanywhere that handles sensitive data,\nthey may well leverage this.\n\n568\n00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.688\nAnd if they do,\nyou'll need to come in here and\n\n569\n00:28:07.688 --> 00:28:10.558\nload an 802.1x certificate\nto be used by the network.\n\n570\n00:28:10.558 --> 00:28:12.865\nOnce it's installed,\nyou'll see the certificates over here, and\n\n571\n00:28:12.865 --> 00:28:14.430\nyou can choose them.\n\n572\n00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.320\nAnd that's what's going to\nauthenticate your laptop or\n\n573\n00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.290\ndesktop to be able to\ncommunicate on the network.\n\n574\n00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:20.840\nWe have proxys.\n\n575\n00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.260\nNot every network allows you\ndirect access to the internet.\n\n576\n00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.780\nInstead, you might be required\nto talk to a proxy sever.\n\n577\n00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.250\nA proxy server is like a middle man.\n\n578\n00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:32.614\nInstead of going to a router you go\nto this proxy server, and you say,\n\n579\n00:28:32.614 --> 00:28:35.878\ncan you give me a copy of CNN.com,\nor give me a copy of apple.com?\n\n580\n00:28:35.878 --> 00:28:38.808\nAnd instead if letting\nyou go to apple.com,\n\n581\n00:28:38.808 --> 00:28:40.975\nthe proxy server does it for you.\n\n582\n00:28:40.975 --> 00:28:43.988\nIt reaches out to Apple, gets a copy of\nthe web page and then presents it to you,\n\n583\n00:28:43.988 --> 00:28:45.400\nit says, here it is.\n\n584\n00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.220\nYou never actually went on the Internet.\n\n585\n00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.120\nNow there's two nice benefits for that.\n\n586\n00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.890\nOne, you can protect people from attacks,\nright?\n\n587\n00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:58.220\nTheir computers are not actually exposed\nto the Internet, only the proxy is.\n\n588\n00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.870\nSo if I secure the proxy, I don't have\nto worry about attackers coming in and\n\n589\n00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:03.160\ngetting into the internal systems.\n\n590\n00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.210\nI just have one place to protect,\nthat's a good thing.\n\n591\n00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.677\nThe other thing is, we can enforce\ndraconian content filtering, right?\n\n592\n00:29:08.677 --> 00:29:11.083\nWe can say, I don't want you to go to CNN.\n\n593\n00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:15.771\nWe can control that, or you can even\nmanipulate content before you deliver it.\n\n594\n00:29:15.771 --> 00:29:19.735\nSo you have a big presidential election or\nsomething you could actually have fake\n\n595\n00:29:19.735 --> 00:29:22.778\nresults, or there's [ [INAUDIBLE]\npranks you can do with it.\n\n596\n00:29:22.778 --> 00:29:26.310\nBut on a serious note, you can use it for\nthings like content filtering.\n\n597\n00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:29.810\nLike blocking adult websites,\ngambling and other things.\n\n598\n00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:33.200\nSo you can define different proxies\nright here if your laptop or\n\n599\n00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.890\ndesktop needs to go through a proxy\nto gain access to the internet.\n\n600\n00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.050\nYou configure that, right here.\n\n601\n00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:39.820\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget the caching feature,\nthat's always nice for\n\n602\n00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.450\npeople with slower networks.\n\n603\n00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if there's 50 people all\ntrying to go to CNN's webpage.\n\n604\n00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.200\nThe proxy server can cache it\nthe first time that it gets it,\n\n605\n00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.830\nand the other 49 people all\nget a local copy super fast.\n\n606\n00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that's pretty handy.\n\n607\n00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:52.860\nNot so good on dynamic webpages.\n\n608\n00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.620\nYou know if you're watching\na sports scoreboard,\n\n609\n00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.095\nyou don't wanna cache the scoreboard.\n\n610\n00:29:56.095 --> 00:29:56.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But for\n\n611\n00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:58.270\na lot of things it works out really well.\n\n612\n00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.598\nAnd then the last tab is the hardware tab.\n\n613\n00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:03.250\nYou're not typically going\nto change things here.\n\n614\n00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.620\nBut this is where we can see our media\naccess control address, our MAC address,\n\n615\n00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.800\nthat's burned in so we can't modify that.\n\n616\n00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:13.970\nAnd then you see a few other things,\nlike your speed, duplex and MTU.\n\n617\n00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.410\nSpeed is how fast your network adapter's\nable to go, what its bandwidth is, right?\n\n618\n00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:19.290\nMost networks these days are gigabit, but\n\n619\n00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:22.870\nthere are 100 megabit and 10 megabit\nnetworks that are still out there.\n\n620\n00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:24.670\nThere are 10 gigabit networks, and so\n\n621\n00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:27.820\nyou'll see your options right\nhere as far as what you support.\n\n622\n00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.600\nBy default, you usually want this to\nbe automatic, it'll autoselect, and\n\n623\n00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.750\nit'll go as fast as the network supports.\n\n624\n00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.240\nThat's typically what we want.\n\n625\n00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.650\nThen you got duplex.\n\n626\n00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:42.420\nDuplex is whether you can send, and\nreceive data at the same time, or not.\n\n627\n00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.240\nIf you're full duplex, you can send and\nreceive at the same time.\n\n628\n00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.005\nIf you're half duplex,\nyou could only send or receive.\n\n629\n00:30:48.005 --> 00:30:51.063\nWell, a gigabit adaptor\nrequires full-duplex.\n\n630\n00:30:51.063 --> 00:30:53.311\nBut if I drop this down to 100 megabit,\n\n631\n00:30:53.311 --> 00:30:57.330\nnow I'll start to see where I've\ngot half-duplex as an option.\n\n632\n00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.760\nWhere I can only send or receive, which is\nslow, that's the old way of doings things.\n\n633\n00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.910\nSo again,\nwe don't necessarily wanna do that.\n\n634\n00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:05.280\nAnd then you'll see\nthe Maximum Transmission Unit, or MTU.\n\n635\n00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.610\nWhen you send data on the network\nit gets broken up into frames.\n\n636\n00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.014\nAnd there's a maximum size of that frame,\n\n637\n00:31:10.014 --> 00:31:12.006\nbecause if a frame get's\ncorrupted we gotta retransmit it.\n\n638\n00:31:12.006 --> 00:31:15.920\nSee you don't want to be too big,\nand so the typical average is 1500.\n\n639\n00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.750\nAnd that's what Apple sets to,\nthat's what Microsoft sets to and\n\n640\n00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:19.800\nseveral of the other vendors.\n\n641\n00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.630\nBut you can tweak it if you need to,\nthere's custom ones.\n\n642\n00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.551\nYou'll see jumbo frames,\nwhich are great for\n\n643\n00:31:23.551 --> 00:31:25.480\nISCSI networks you can go up to 9,000,.\n\n644\n00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.170\nYou can actually go even higher than that,\nbut your switches need to support it.\n\n645\n00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.790\nYour network adaptors needs to support it,\nand\n\n646\n00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.160\nyour Operating System needs to support it.\n\n647\n00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.140\n&gt;&gt; I think you just inadvertently\nmade a Dragon Ball Z reference.\n\n648\n00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.040\n&gt;&gt; It goes up to 9,000, or\nit's over 9,000 [INAUDIBLE].\n\n649\n00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.140\n&gt;&gt; Never seen Dragon Ball Z,\nso I don't know.\n\n650\n00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.497\n&gt;&gt; DBZ fans out there-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Are cracking up right now,\n\n651\n00:31:41.497 --> 00:31:43.269\nthey're going he just\nsaid it's over 9,000.\n\n652\n00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:44.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's over 9,000.\n\n653\n00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:45.160\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n654\n00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:45.850\nSweet.\n\n655\n00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.265\nI know it makes your hair spiky.\n\n656\n00:31:47.265 --> 00:31:47.950\n&gt;&gt; It does do that.\n\n657\n00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:49.380\n&gt;&gt; So there we go [LAUGH].\n\n658\n00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.372\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, okay, so\n\n659\n00:31:51.372 --> 00:31:54.170\nthat's basically the advanced options for\na network adapter.\n\n660\n00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.720\nI didn't get to wireless but\nwe'll get to that in the next episode.\n\n661\n00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.670\nIt's definitely an important thing we\nsee wireless more and more these days.\n\n662\n00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:02.820\nBut hopefully you have a good idea of\nthe configuration options right there for\n\n663\n00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.410\na standard network adapter.\n\n664\n00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:05.850\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff Don, thanks for\n\n665\n00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.718\ngetting us thus far on our network\nconfigurations inside of Mac OS.\n\n666\n00:32:09.718 --> 00:32:13.160\nVery multifaceted, there's a lot of\ndifferent areas in which we have to be\n\n667\n00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.260\naware of to make networking efficient, and\nworking, and doing things we need to do.\n\n668\n00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.140\nAnd if trouble shooting ever comes\ninto play, well now you have\n\n669\n00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:24.750\na better idea where you might need to go,\ndepending on the issue that you're having.\n\n670\n00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.840\nSo Don, we do look forward to finishing\nthis up, hopefully in part three.\n\n671\n00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.930\nWe got a little wireless to go through.\n\n672\n00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:30.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully we'll see you\n\n673\n00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.250\nguys there on that one as well.\n\n674\n00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.570\nBut as for this episode,\nlooks like we've come to the end.\n\n675\n00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:35.660\nThanks for joining us.\n\n676\n00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.320\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n677\n00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.220\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n678\n00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:39.921\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n679\n00:32:39.921

San Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:06.302\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:08.251\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:10.000\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.490\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.410\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n9\n00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.350\nin today's episode we're continuing\non with more of our ASCP series.\n\n10\n00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.120\nAnd joining us back in the studio for a\npart three on networking, I know it seems\n\n11\n00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.260\nlike it's the subject that will never end,\nbut we promise we will get there one day.\n\n12\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.200\nIs our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n13\n00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.430\nDon, we're glad to have you again.\n\n14\n00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.164\nHow is it going today?\n\n15\n00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:36.065\n&gt;&gt; It is going swell.\n\n16\n00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:38.015\nReady to dive right back into networking,\nand\n\n17\n00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:40.965\nwe're actually gonna focus in on\nsomething that's really important\n\n18\n00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:44.323\nbecause in the first two episodes I've\nbeen using a physical network adapter.\n\n19\n00:00:44.323 --> 00:00:47.600\nBut that is becoming less and less common.\n\n20\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.980\nWireless networks have really\nsignificantly improved from what they\n\n21\n00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.380\noriginally were back in 1999 and\n2000, when they became popularized,\n\n22\n00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.730\nthat we've had 17 years of\nadvancements in technology.\n\n23\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.470\nAnd, boy, has it come a long way.\n\n24\n00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.645\nSo much so, that many networks have\ngone completely wireless at this point.\n\n25\n00:01:07.645 --> 00:01:09.280\nAnd for a home network,\n\n26\n00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.580\nwe used to run cable through\nthe walls all the time at home.\n\n27\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.940\nNow, wireless is suitable for most people.\n\n28\n00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.570\nSo, it's really come a long way.\n\n29\n00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.475\nFor mobile devices,\n\n30\n00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:19.810\nit's a necessity because you don't have\nthe physical network jacks on them.\n\n31\n00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.780\nSo we need to understand how to get\na wireless network configured, and some of\n\n32\n00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.180\nthe different options that are available\nthat we might need to tweak with.\n\n33\n00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.750\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\n\n34\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.050\nwireless is super convenient,\nthat's why we like it so much, right?\n\n35\n00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.460\nWe're not tethered to one spot.\n\n36\n00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.290\nLike Don said, we used to have to run\nwires through the walls in our house.\n\n37\n00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.000\nAnd if you've ever worked a fishtape to do\nthat, you know the hell of which I speak.\n\n38\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.870\nThat's not a fun, fun time.\n\n39\n00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.365\nSo wireless has us at convenience,\nbut it's interesting.\n\n40\n00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:45.360\nSometimes you get people and\nthey call you up and\n\n41\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.380\nsay I can't connect to the wireless,\nwhat the heck is going on?\n\n42\n00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.830\nThis is supposed to just work for\nme, right?\n\n43\n00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.134\nIt's a Mac product, too, though.\n\n44\n00:01:52.134 --> 00:01:55.178\nEverything just works,\nwhy is this just not working?\n\n45\n00:01:55.178 --> 00:01:57.330\nSo, we have to understand\nhow it does work so\n\n46\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.500\nwe can troubleshoot those issues, right?\n\n47\n00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.735\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; So, Don, where do we begin with that?\n\n48\n00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:05.315\nAll right, well, first off, every Mac\nsold today has a wireless card in it.\n\n49\n00:02:05.315 --> 00:02:08.865\nEvery iMac, Macpro,\nMacbookpro, it doesn't matter.\n\n50\n00:02:08.865 --> 00:02:12.485\nEven if it's a desktop like the iMac Pro,\nthey have wireless built into them.\n\n51\n00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:14.395\nThe Mac mini has wireless built into it.\n\n52\n00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:15.025\nSo they've all got it.\n\n53\n00:02:16.255 --> 00:02:19.365\nWe might turn it off and not use it,\nbut they do have it, all right?\n\n54\n00:02:19.365 --> 00:02:22.495\nAnd it's easy to see if you do because\nyou'll have right here in your menu bar up\n\n55\n00:02:22.495 --> 00:02:25.550\nat the top of your screen,\nyou'll have a little wireless symbol.\n\n56\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.375\nAnd you may not be connected to anything,\nbut it will be there, right?\n\n57\n00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:30.930\nAnd so, when I clicked on mine,\nwhile it was looking for\n\n58\n00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.710\na network for a brief moment\nthere to populate the list, but\n\n59\n00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.860\notherwise it shows that I am\nconnected to the ITProTV network.\n\n60\n00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.004\nAnd I can turn wireless off if I\ndon't want to use it, all right?\n\n61\n00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:42.836\nIf I turn it off, well, it just drops.\n\n62\n00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:45.490\nThe network should turn the antennas off,\nright?\n\n63\n00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.330\nThere are antennas for\nyour wireless adapter.\n\n64\n00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.940\nHere on my laptop,\nif you ever disassemble one of these,\n\n65\n00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.930\nit's kinda neat because the wireless\nantennas actually run through the display,\n\n66\n00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.700\nthey run up the sides of the display.\n\n67\n00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.540\nCuz that's a big,\nnice open area they can get.\n\n68\n00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.240\nAnd they know the display\nwill be pointing straight up,\n\n69\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.850\nwhich is perfect for an antenna.\n\n70\n00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.800\nSo they'll run them that way.\n\n71\n00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.570\nSame thing in the iMacs where the antennas\nrun along the edge of the monitors.\n\n72\n00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.320\nThe Mac Pro, I actually don't know\nwhere their stuck in the trash can,\n\n73\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.670\nyou know that round cylindrical Mac Pro.\n\n74\n00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.830\nI'm not sure where its antennas are.\n\n75\n00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.430\nBut basically, it's turning antennas on or\nturning them off.\n\n76\n00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.460\nWhen you turn the antennas off,\nnow you're wireless doesn't work and\n\n77\n00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.490\nthat's the end of it.\n\n78\n00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.710\nNow, you should see up there\nin the menu bar, but if not,\n\n79\n00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.894\nyou definitely see it in your\nsystem preferences, right?\n\n80\n00:03:25.894 --> 00:03:28.090\nSo if I jump into my\nsystem preferences and\n\n81\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.870\nI go in to Network, then you should\nsee your Wi-Fi adapter right there.\n\n82\n00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.730\nAnd you can turn Wi-Fi on and off right\nfrom inside of your System Preferences.\n\n83\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.860\nOnce you turn it on,\nit should show on the menu bar, but\n\n84\n00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.690\nyou can turn the menu bar item off.\n\n85\n00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.920\nThat's why I bring this up.\n\n86\n00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.240\nIf it's turned off,\n\n87\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.180\nthen I'm not going to see that wireless\nsymbol up there to turn it on and off.\n\n88\n00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.800\nSo don't rely just on the menu bar.\n\n89\n00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.170\nYou might need to go in to your\nSystem Preferences to turn that on.\n\n90\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.290\nI always keep mine on, though,\ncuz I switch networks and\n\n91\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.610\nI want to be able to see what's going on.\n\n92\n00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.730\nSo having that option's kinda handy.\n\n93\n00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.310\nAll right, now when you turn your\nWi-Fi on, it's immediately gonna start\n\n94\n00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.010\nscanning the network, and it's looking for\nwireless networks that are available.\n\n95\n00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.790\nWireless networks use what's called and\nSSID, or a service set identifier.\n\n96\n00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.850\nIt's a name, they all have a name.\n\n97\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.763\nAnd so when you connect to, or\nturn your wireless antenna on,\n\n98\n00:04:15.763 --> 00:04:19.850\nit's pulling a list of all the names,\nrather all the SSIDs that it can find.\n\n99\n00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.120\nSo if we look at mine,\n\n100\n00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.240\nit connected to ITProTV cuz that's\nwhat I connected to last time.\n\n101\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.120\nBut if I drop it down, I'll see all\nthe other SSIDs that are out there, right?\n\n102\n00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.640\nNow, most of these are just names.\n\n103\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.960\nBut if you look to the side,\nyou'll see little icons,\n\n104\n00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.280\nand part of it is signal strength, right?\n\n105\n00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.290\nSo the MMF network has a full\nfour-bars strong signal.\n\n106\n00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.620\nAnd NH-ASO, NH-Private,\nthese all have good strong signals.\n\n107\n00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.230\nBut then if I look at this one,\nGainesville Dev Academy-guest,\n\n108\n00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.230\nthis one only has three out\nof the four bars, right?\n\n109\n00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.955\nIt's a weaker signal.\n\n110\n00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:58.370\nI'm further away from that access point.\n\n111\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.930\nSo, the closer you are,\nthe faster your connection will be.\n\n112\n00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.460\nThe further away you are,\nthe slower the connection will be.\n\n113\n00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.890\nYou'll also notice this\nones missing a lock.\n\n114\n00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.660\nAll the ones that have locks,\nthose are encrypted.\n\n115\n00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.820\nThey're protected with one of three\ndifferent encryption mechanisms.\n\n116\n00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.740\nThere's the older WEP, or\nwired equivalency protocol.\n\n117\n00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.310\nWEP is a very old protocol that's\nnot considered very secure anymore.\n\n118\n00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.250\nIt's very easy to break it, right?\n\n119\n00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.720\nIt would take just a couple of\nminutes to break the encryption on it.\n\n120\n00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.290\nNot recommended.\n\n121\n00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.970\nOr there's WPA,\nthe wi-fi protected access.\n\n122\n00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.810\nAnd WPA is considered stronger, but\nit's a little bit at risk right now.\n\n123\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.618\nAnd WPA2, the replacement for it,\nthat's the one we want to use.\n\n124\n00:05:38.618 --> 00:05:40.180\nSo, that's Wi-Fi Protected Access 2.\n\n125\n00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.940\nIt moved to a stronger encryption protocol\nand it hasn't been broken yet, so\n\n126\n00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.080\nthat's where we really wanna be.\n\n127\n00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.790\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don, if those other protocols\nare so easily cracked and gotten through,\n\n128\n00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.680\nwhy are they even available,\nwhy aren't we just defaulting the WPA2?\n\n129\n00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.970\n&gt;&gt; Well, sometimes you might have\nequipment that doesn't support WPA2 yet,\n\n130\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.350\nso you might have for compatibility\npurposes a need to go for a lower one.\n\n131\n00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.504\nIf you do, it's not the end of the world,\nyou just can't trust it, right?\n\n132\n00:06:03.504 --> 00:06:05.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well, you don't trust most networks.\n\n133\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.190\nIf I go to Starbucks and\nI connect to their wireless network,\n\n134\n00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.030\ndo I trust their wireless network?\n\n135\n00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.360\nNo, I don't care what level of\nencryption they use, I don't trust it.\n\n136\n00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.670\nBecause I didn't set it up, right?\n\n137\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.550\nI don't know who they've shared keys with.\n\n138\n00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.330\nSo, you'll typically want to\ncombine wireless access with a VPN.\n\n139\n00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.350\nAnd that way you create\na virtual private network,\n\n140\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.040\nan encrypted tunnel that you do\ncontrol over this wireless network.\n\n141\n00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.030\nSo from that perspective, I don't\nreally care what encryption they have\n\n142\n00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.070\nif I know I'm going to\nbe encrypting it myself.\n\n143\n00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.140\nSo when I see something like\nthe Gainesville Dev Academy here,\n\n144\n00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.600\nwhere it's unencrypted,\nthat sounds bad, doesn't it?\n\n145\n00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.710\nIt's not bad, you just need to be aware.\n\n146\n00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.410\nOkay, this is an unencrypted network,\nI can jump on it.\n\n147\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.080\nBut when I do, other people might\nbe able to eavesdrop on my data.\n\n148\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.560\nIf I'm going to secure websites,\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n149\n00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.780\nBut if I'm doing non-secure type traffic,\nI need to make sure I'm encrypting it\n\n150\n00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.810\nsomehow, and\nusing something like a VPN tunnel.\n\n151\n00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.090\nSo that's why we have that lock icon,\nso we can recognize whether or\n\n152\n00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.440\nnot our connection is secure.\n\n153\n00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.910\nNow, if you connect to a secured network,\n\n154\n00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.830\nyou'll have to provide a password\nto get connected, all right?\n\n155\n00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.070\nSo if I were to switch over to\nsomething like ITProTV-Guest, and\n\n156\n00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.620\nconnect to that one,\nit's going to prompt me for the password.\n\n157\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.730\nAnd it's telling me this network\nrequires a WPA2 password.\n\n158\n00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.630\nSo good, I know it's using WPA2,\nit's not using WEP or\n\n159\n00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.610\nsomething kind of weaker like that.\n\n160\n00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.960\nSo I'll have to punch in the password,\nand then I can get connected.\n\n161\n00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.490\nBut if I were to pick something like\nthat Gainesville Dev Academy-guest,\n\n162\n00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.550\nI can choose it, and\nit's gonna connect, and\n\n163\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.410\nit's telling me we're turned on,\nit's trying to connect.\n\n164\n00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.650\nDid I miss it?\n\n165\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.702\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; Says wi-fi is off.\n\n166\n00:07:34.702 --> 00:07:36.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It says I could not be joined,\n\n167\n00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.550\ntry moving closer.\n\n168\n00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.930\nI must actually be far enough-\n&gt;&gt; Just too far away.\n\n169\n00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot of\nwalls between here and there.\n\n170\n00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:41.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n171\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.911\nit wasn't good enough to quite get there.\n\n172\n00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:47.200\nBut it won't ask for\na password because it's unencrypted,\n\n173\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.751\nbecause it's just an open network\nthat anybody can connect to.\n\n174\n00:07:51.751 --> 00:07:54.670\nSo we do need to be aware that\nas we choose these networks and\n\n175\n00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.871\nget connected to them.\n\n176\n00:07:55.871 --> 00:07:59.550\nYou want a secured connection,\nby all means if you can.\n\n177\n00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.150\nNow as far as the authentication side,\nI mentioned the password, right?\n\n178\n00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.740\nA password is what's called\na preshared key, or a PSK.\n\n179\n00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.830\nSomebody tells me the password, hey,\n\n180\n00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.960\nif you wanna connect to the ITPRO.TV guest\nnetwork, here is the password, right?\n\n181\n00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.470\nAnd so, I come in with a laptop,\nI wanna get on the guest network,\n\n182\n00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.340\nI punch in the password, and off we go.\n\n183\n00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.800\nThe problem with\nthe password is it's shared.\n\n184\n00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.900\nSo if ten people come into the building,\nand I give all ten of them the password.\n\n185\n00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.335\nAnd then, I find out one of them is doing\nbad stuff, and I wanna kick him off.\n\n186\n00:08:25.335 --> 00:08:27.810\nThey're all using the same password, so\n\n187\n00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.120\nI've gotta change the password for\neverybody.\n\n188\n00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.750\nThe nine people who\nare behaving themselves,\n\n189\n00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.665\nI just had to kick them off too\nwhile I changed the password.\n\n190\n00:08:34.665 --> 00:08:39.000\nSo there is an alternative, there is\nwhat's called WPA2 Enterprise, and\n\n191\n00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.830\nin the enterprise version, instead of\nusing a password, you use a certificate.\n\n192\n00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.520\nIn the last episode,\nI mentioned 802.1X authentication, and\n\n193\n00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.020\nhow you can use certificates to\nauthenticate on the network.\n\n194\n00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.570\nWell, that's what WPA2 Enterprise does.\n\n195\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.910\nIn enterprise mode, you connect to\nthe Wi-Fi not using a password, but\n\n196\n00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.290\nusing your certificate\nto validate who you are.\n\n197\n00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.460\nThe nice part about that is every\nperson has their own certificate, so\n\n198\n00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.660\nif I want to kick one person off, I can.\n\n199\n00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.390\nI can just invalidate that\none person's certificate,\n\n200\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.230\neverybody else still works like normal.\n\n201\n00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.060\nThat sounds great,\nthat sounds like the perfect solution.\n\n202\n00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.270\nWhy wouldn't we use it?\n\n203\n00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.116\nCuz its a pain in the butt to get set up,\nright?\n\n204\n00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:14.006\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You have to have what's called a PKI,\n\n205\n00:09:14.006 --> 00:09:15.260\na public key infrastructure.\n\n206\n00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.900\nYou have to have a certificate\nserver that's issuing certificates.\n\n207\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.340\nYou've got to be installing\nthe certificates on the machines.\n\n208\n00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.260\nEvery time a new device\ncomes into your network,\n\n209\n00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.890\nyou've got to issue them a certificate, or\nthey can't get on the wireless network.\n\n210\n00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.450\nAnd if you're supporting phones,\nand tablets, and desktops, and\n\n211\n00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.170\nlaptops, it really does\nget to become a headache.\n\n212\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.700\nIt even gets more challenging when\nyou have things like projectors and\n\n213\n00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.100\nprinters, that it might not be very\neasy to load a certificate on them.\n\n214\n00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.070\nSo that's when you have to\nstart making exceptions, and\n\n215\n00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.760\nexceptions weaken your network.\n\n216\n00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.660\nSo it's a challenge.\n\n217\n00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.700\nEnterprises will do it though,\nbecause it's worth it.\n\n218\n00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.430\nIt's worth it to get\na more secure network.\n\n219\n00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.300\nBut at home, or in a small business,\nyou'll use a PSK, cuz it's easier.\n\n220\n00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.130\nAnd yeah, every now and then you might\nhave to inconvenience everybody and\n\n221\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.830\nchange your password,\nbut it's a lot easier.\n\n222\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.040\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, speaking of wireless security,\n\n223\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.225\nwe like to throw the air\nquotes around this.\n\n224\n00:10:02.225 --> 00:10:03.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you talked about the SSID,\n\n225\n00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.270\nwhich is, basically, saying,\nhere is our network.\n\n226\n00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.620\nHere's the name of that network.\n\n227\n00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:13.010\nAnd a lot of people like to say,\nwell if I don't Share that information,\n\n228\n00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:17.252\nthen you can't find my network, you'd have\nto know what it is to be able to find it.\n\n229\n00:10:17.252 --> 00:10:20.260\nIf we wanted to go that route,\nthat security through obscurity,\n\n230\n00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.491\nhow would we do that?\n\n231\n00:10:21.491 --> 00:10:24.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nit's not considered true security,\n\n232\n00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.070\nbut it certainly does help a little bit.\n\n233\n00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.830\nBasically, when you have\na wireless access point, or\n\n234\n00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.020\na router, it's advertising itself.\n\n235\n00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.930\nIts broadcasting out, it's sending out\nwhat's called a beacon saying, hey,\n\n236\n00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.150\nI exist, here's my SSID.\n\n237\n00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.639\nSo when I turned on wireless,\nthis list here was populated by access\n\n238\n00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:44.202\npoints that are in, or\nnear, our building, right.\n\n239\n00:10:44.202 --> 00:10:47.613\nSome of these, like BBH, I think\nthat's one of our neighbors, right.\n\n240\n00:10:47.613 --> 00:10:50.992\nSo one of them is broadcasting out,\nand in extending into this area,\n\n241\n00:10:50.992 --> 00:10:54.331\nI'm detecting them,\nbecause they're advertising themselves.\n\n242\n00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:57.947\nBut there might be other wireless\nnetworks out there that I just don't see,\n\n243\n00:10:57.947 --> 00:11:00.672\nthat are hidden,\nthat are not advertising themselves.\n\n244\n00:11:00.672 --> 00:11:03.638\nThey're there, but\nthey're not advertising in SSID.\n\n245\n00:11:03.638 --> 00:11:06.169\nAnd if you want to connect to one of them,\n\n246\n00:11:06.169 --> 00:11:09.519\nthat's why you have this\nJoin Other Network option,\n\n247\n00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:13.800\nyou can choose Join Other Network,\nand now you can type in the SSID.\n\n248\n00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.020\nThey're not advertising it,\nbut you can type it in.\n\n249\n00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.360\nAnd once you do that,\nnow you can connect up.\n\n250\n00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.730\nNow, because it's not being advertised,\nit's not gonna know things.\n\n251\n00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.240\nSo let's say we had\na ITProTV-Secure network,\n\n252\n00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.450\nit's not gonna know\nwhat encryption to use.\n\n253\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.380\nSo I've gotta drop that down,\nand I've gotta pick.\n\n254\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:33.204\nAnd you'll see WEP, WPA/WPA2 Personal,\nand WPA2 Personal, and\n\n255\n00:11:33.204 --> 00:11:37.552\nthen you move down here, and\nyou've got Enterprise, right.\n\n256\n00:11:37.552 --> 00:11:41.850\nSo the first three, those are pre-shared\nkey, or password networks.\n\n257\n00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.000\nThe last three are certificate networks.\n\n258\n00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.460\nThat's the difference\nbetween Enterprise and\n\n259\n00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.340\nPersonal, is certificate versus password.\n\n260\n00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.460\nIn a business, you might be using personal\nmodes just because it's easier, but\n\n261\n00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.075\nyou'd need to specify which one.\n\n262\n00:11:53.075 --> 00:11:56.910\nWPA/WPA2, that's a compatibility mode,\n\n263\n00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.280\nwhere it'll connect to either one,\nit's using the old encryption algorithm.\n\n264\n00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.544\nYou really want to be\nusing the newer just WPA2.\n\n265\n00:12:04.544 --> 00:12:07.561\nAnd you would punch in\nwhatever that password is, and\n\n266\n00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:09.450\nthen you'd hit Join, right.\n\n267\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.722\nThis network doesn't actually exist.\n\n268\n00:12:10.722 --> 00:12:11.554\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm just typing something.\n\n269\n00:12:11.554 --> 00:12:12.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you'd join, and\n\n270\n00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.280\nyou'd be able to connect up to it, right.\n\n271\n00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.256\nBut it's not gonna be able to find\na network that's not advertising itself.\n\n272\n00:12:17.256 --> 00:12:21.030\nNow, I've said that it's not really\nsecurity, and the reason is,\n\n273\n00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:25.080\nthat if a hacker whose worth their salt\ncomes in, they can take their antennas and\n\n274\n00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.320\nmove them into promiscuous mode and\n\n275\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.310\njust start listening for\nany wireless traffic and collecting it.\n\n276\n00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.970\nAnd when they collect it,\neven if your traffic is encrypted,\n\n277\n00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.290\nthe SSID is stamped on the frame\nthat's being transmitted.\n\n278\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.800\nAnd so, they can just intercept any\nframe and look at the SSID on it, and\n\n279\n00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.070\nnow they know the SSID.\n\n280\n00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.330\nSo while it wasn't being advertised,\nthey are able to figure it out.\n\n281\n00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.990\nSo by hiding the SSID,\nyou're not stopping a talented hacker,\n\n282\n00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.860\nyou're just stopping the lazy hackers,\nright?\n\n283\n00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.290\nThe ones who-\n&gt;&gt; Just looking for\n\n284\n00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.330\nthe low-hanging fruit kind of people.\n\n285\n00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.065\n&gt;&gt; And that happens.\n\n286\n00:12:56.065 --> 00:12:58.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You get a lot of people, I know me,\n\n287\n00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.560\nI went to France once for a few weeks,\n\n288\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.545\nand I just piggybacked off of any\nwireless network that I could find.\n\n289\n00:13:03.545 --> 00:13:06.940\nCuz I would always throw up a VPN tunnel,\nso I knew my data was safe, but\n\n290\n00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.600\nI just would bounce from network to\nnetwork to network trying to find one that\n\n291\n00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.290\nwould give me enough internet access.\n\n292\n00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.130\nSo, you'll stop people like that,\nbecause I wasn't gonna\n\n293\n00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:19.980\nput a ton of effort behind finding hidden\nnetworks just to be able to get out.\n\n294\n00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.940\nSo you'll stop that, but\n\n295\n00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.170\nyou won't stop somebody who's\nlike specifically targeting you,\n\n296\n00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:28.840\nthey've got ways to find those SSIDs, so\nbe aware of that in your security model.\n\n297\n00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.320\nBut yeah, you would use that manual\njoint entry and you'd get connected.\n\n298\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Don, we've talked\nabout connecting to wireless networks.\n\n299\n00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.710\nIt's a pretty simple thing,\nyou turn on your computer.\n\n300\n00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:43.580\nIt looks for open wireless, or wireless\nthat you've connected to before, and\n\n301\n00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.540\nit connects to it, it's very nice.\n\n302\n00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.190\nBut every now and then, you need to kind\nof create that one-to-one environment,\n\n303\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.480\nright, and make connection.\n\n304\n00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.790\nAgain, if I don't have a dono with me,\n\n305\n00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.310\nI can't go to the old\ncrossover cable method.\n\n306\n00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But wireless is built-in,\n\n307\n00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.140\nwould I be able to do that\nthrough wireless as well?\n\n308\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.083\n&gt;&gt; So let's say you and I are on a train.\n\n309\n00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:03.717\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I've got a file, and\n\n310\n00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:04.770\nI wanna share it with you.\n\n311\n00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.534\nWe're sitting there,\nwe both have our laptops.\n\n312\n00:14:06.534 --> 00:14:07.085\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n313\n00:14:07.085 --> 00:14:09.595\n&gt;&gt; But there's no network available for\nus, right?\n\n314\n00:14:09.595 --> 00:14:11.675\nYou can create what's\ncalled an ad hoc network.\n\n315\n00:14:11.675 --> 00:14:13.845\nAn ad hoc network is a temporary network,\n\n316\n00:14:13.845 --> 00:14:16.895\nwhere one of your laptops will\nact as the access point, and\n\n317\n00:14:16.895 --> 00:14:20.325\nthe other one will act as a client, and\nyou can connect them together, right?\n\n318\n00:14:20.325 --> 00:14:22.629\nIf you come up here to, actually,\ncan you do it from here?\n\n319\n00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:23.295\nLet me see.\n\n320\n00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:24.375\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n321\n00:14:24.375 --> 00:14:24.935\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if you\n\n322\n00:14:24.935 --> 00:14:25.655\ncan do it from here.\n\n323\n00:14:25.655 --> 00:14:27.575\nBut you can definitely do it\nfrom up here in the menu.\n\n324\n00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:33.210\nUp in the menu, if you drop-down that\nwireless icon, down at the bottom, we got\n\n325\n00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:38.020\nJoin Other Network for the hidden SSID,\nand right beneath that, Create a Network.\n\n326\n00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.470\nI can make a new network, and\n\n327\n00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.400\nwhen you create a network,\nyou become the access point.\n\n328\n00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.760\nI'm gonna turn my laptop\ninto the access point.\n\n329\n00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.290\nI'll create a network called\nDon's MacBook Pro, right?\n\n330\n00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.550\nAnd I can send it to a channel, right?\n\n331\n00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.830\nIf you're doing 802.11, B or\n\n332\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.930\nG, the older standards, they just\nhave channels one through eleven.\n\n333\n00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:03.450\nBut if you're doing, A, N or\nAC, am I leaving anybody out?\n\n334\n00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:04.720\nThe list is really getting long.\n\n335\n00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; They have more channels, so\n\n336\n00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.880\nyou can choose higher channels like 36,\n48, whatever.\n\n337\n00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.250\nUsually if you're just doing laptop to\nlaptop trying to transfer something really\n\n338\n00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.430\nquick, you don't really care\nabout the high speed stuff.\n\n339\n00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.030\nSo I'll stick with the default of 11,\nand I can create that, and\n\n340\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.070\nits gonna kick that network on.\n\n341\n00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:25.660\nAnd now,\nmy laptop becomes an access point, okay.\n\n342\n00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.750\nNow, once that's done,\nI'm now running a network, and\n\n343\n00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:34.630\nsee how mine says, Wi-Fi no IP Address,\nI just created an ad hoc network.\n\n344\n00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.540\nAnd somebody near me, like Daniel,\ncould fire up his wireless.\n\n345\n00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.540\nAnd he should see a new SSID in\nthe list that says, Don's MacBook Pro,\n\n346\n00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.750\nand he can connect to it.\n\n347\n00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.224\nAnd now, we'll be able to transfer\ndata back and forth between us.\n\n348\n00:15:47.224 --> 00:15:50.291\nAlright, now there's no DHCP server,\nor anything on that network, so\n\n349\n00:15:50.291 --> 00:15:52.723\nyou'll see where I get what's\ncalled an APIPA address.\n\n350\n00:15:52.723 --> 00:15:55.964\nAPIPA, let's see if I can\nremember what this stands for,\n\n351\n00:15:55.964 --> 00:15:58.082\nis Automatic Private IP Addressing or\n\n352\n00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:01.400\nAutomatic Private Internet\nProtocol Addressing.\n\n353\n00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.925\nAnd APIPA will give me a fake address.\n\n354\n00:16:03.925 --> 00:16:06.602\nWell, when Daniel connects,\nhe'll fake address also, and\n\n355\n00:16:06.602 --> 00:16:08.153\nthey're both in the same numbers.\n\n356\n00:16:08.153 --> 00:16:10.656\nThey'll both start with 169.254.\n\n357\n00:16:10.656 --> 00:16:12.830\nSo we'll be able to see each other.\n\n358\n00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.679\nAnd on a Mac, the Bonjour protocol would\ndiscover us even if we didn't have IP\n\n359\n00:16:16.679 --> 00:16:18.170\naddresses, even fake ones.\n\n360\n00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.371\nSo, we'd then be able to communicate that\nway and now we can exchange files or\n\n361\n00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:22.158\nplay video games or\n\n362\n00:16:22.158 --> 00:16:25.280\nwhatever it is that we're trying to do\nto get these two devices to connect.\n\n363\n00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.650\nSo Ad Hoc networks are really useful for\nthat.\n\n364\n00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.715\nOne negative, though,\nis that once I create that Ad Hoc network,\n\n365\n00:16:31.715 --> 00:16:35.081\nit didn't really ask me for things\nlike a password and all that, right?\n\n366\n00:16:35.081 --> 00:16:38.810\nIt is a very basic network that\nit's whipped up and created for me.\n\n367\n00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:44.290\nAnd so when I look at that setting,\nit's not encrypted.\n\n368\n00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.410\nIt's not really kinda tied down\nthe way that I may want it.\n\n369\n00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.525\nSo it's really designed for temporary use.\n\n370\n00:16:49.525 --> 00:16:53.357\nAnd there's other things that you\ncould use instead like Airdrop and\n\n371\n00:16:53.357 --> 00:16:56.738\nprotocols like that that run\nover other wireless networks.\n\n372\n00:16:56.738 --> 00:16:59.830\nBut they all assume that there\nis some other network there.\n\n373\n00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.510\nSo if you have absolutely nothing,\n\n374\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.658\nthen this is a good way to quickly\ntransfer items between devices.\n\n375\n00:17:04.658 --> 00:17:09.050\n&gt;&gt; So anybody that's in the vicinity that\nwas able to detect your network could\n\n376\n00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.500\nbe able to connect to it?\n\n377\n00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.206\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm glad you mentioned\nvicinity, it's not very far, right?\n\n378\n00:17:13.206 --> 00:17:13.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n379\n00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.762\n&gt;&gt; And access point will get you, assuming\nthere's no walls, it'll get you 300 feet.\n\n380\n00:17:17.762 --> 00:17:22.398\nWhat is that, 100 meters or something for\n\n381\n00:17:22.398 --> 00:17:27.061\nour metric users but [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is technically us.\n\n382\n00:17:27.061 --> 00:17:29.928\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But when you use a laptop as an access\n\n383\n00:17:29.928 --> 00:17:32.972\npoint, it doesn't go very far,\nlike 30 feet, 40 feet.\n\n384\n00:17:32.972 --> 00:17:35.460\nYeah, you're not getting a long distance.\n\n385\n00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.270\nSo really if your two devices are next\nto each other, it works really well.\n\n386\n00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.830\nThe further away you get,\nthe worse it gets.\n\n387\n00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:41.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, super weak.\n\n388\n00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.560\n&gt;&gt; Yep, all right, let me get\nback onto a normal network here.\n\n389\n00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.630\nThere is a little bit more that I\nwanna talk about on this stuff.\n\n390\n00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.060\nCreating our own network\nis a pretty unusual thing,\n\n391\n00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.590\nwe don't do that all that often\nthese days, but it's there.\n\n392\n00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:58.360\nBut there are some advanced options with\nany of this stuff that we can go in and\n\n393\n00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.640\ntweak and change.\n\n394\n00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.630\nSo one that I wanna point out is an option\nthat's a little bit misunderstood.\n\n395\n00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.300\nThere's this option right here,\nAsk to join new networks, and\n\n396\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.250\nsee how it's not checked?\n\n397\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:10.880\nThat's the default for this.\n\n398\n00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.690\nIn other words, if I fire up my laptop and\nit goes and does the scan and\n\n399\n00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:20.990\nit sees an unsecured network that's out\nthere, it'll just connect to it, right?\n\n400\n00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:24.600\nIt assumes, hey,\nsome network is better than no network, so\n\n401\n00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.420\nI'll connect to this unsecured network.\n\n402\n00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.230\n&gt;&gt; And it does that for\nthe ease of use kind of philosophy, right?\n\n403\n00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.730\nOpen your laptop, it finds wireless,\nconnects, you're on the Internet.\n\n404\n00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.562\n&gt;&gt; Two reasons, right?\n\n405\n00:18:33.562 --> 00:18:36.620\nSo one is ease of use and\ntwo is find my Mac.\n\n406\n00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.617\nIf somebody steals your Mac and\nruns, it's gonna try and\n\n407\n00:18:39.617 --> 00:18:44.240\nconnect to any wireless network that\nit can to be able to phone home, right?\n\n408\n00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.140\nThat's a good thing, that's a benefit.\n\n409\n00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.870\nBut it's also a bad thing in that\nyour laptop or desktop, I guess,\n\n410\n00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.210\nif you've got a generator, but\n\n411\n00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:56.910\nyour laptop is connecting to networks that\nyou haven't necessarily approved, right?\n\n412\n00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.720\nAnd it may not be a trustworthy network.\n\n413\n00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.160\nIt could be a rogue access point.\n\n414\n00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.195\nAn attacker could've set up an AP and\n\n415\n00:19:02.195 --> 00:19:06.150\nthey could be recording all the traffic\ngoing through it, you don't know.\n\n416\n00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:10.310\nIf you only want to connect to networks\nthat you trust, you can check this and\n\n417\n00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.230\nsay, always Ask to join new networks.\n\n418\n00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.260\nDon't just randomly connect to an\nunsecured network unless you ask me first.\n\n419\n00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.870\nOn a positive side,\nit gives you a little more control.\n\n420\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.138\nOn the negative side,\nit kinda breaks Fnd my Mac,\n\n421\n00:19:22.138 --> 00:19:25.872\nthat Find my Mac is trusting that you'll\nbe able to connect to a wireless network.\n\n422\n00:19:25.872 --> 00:19:28.131\nAnd if you've left your\nguest account enabled,\n\n423\n00:19:28.131 --> 00:19:30.345\nthen an attacker might log in as guest and\ndo it.\n\n424\n00:19:30.345 --> 00:19:33.111\nBut if they just take your laptop and\nformat it,\n\n425\n00:19:33.111 --> 00:19:36.445\nthen Find My Mac probably's\nnot gonna help you, right?\n\n426\n00:19:36.445 --> 00:19:41.005\nSo just be aware that's why this\noption is turned off by default,\n\n427\n00:19:41.005 --> 00:19:43.675\nis to help locate your Mac.\n\n428\n00:19:43.675 --> 00:19:44.995\nI don't like the option myself.\n\n429\n00:19:44.995 --> 00:19:47.575\nI usually keep it off and\njust trust that I don't lose my laptop,\n\n430\n00:19:47.575 --> 00:19:50.260\nbut we don't normally choose\nto lose a laptop, right?\n\n431\n00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.346\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda forced on us.\n\n432\n00:19:51.346 --> 00:19:53.540\n&gt;&gt; I think I'll let my\nlaptop get stolen today.\n\n433\n00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.510\nThat's a good idea.\n\n434\n00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.402\n&gt;&gt; It's a good day for that.\n\n435\n00:19:56.402 --> 00:19:59.550\nAll right now, you'll also see we got a\nlittle Advanced button down at the bottom.\n\n436\n00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.148\nAnd if we hit that Advanced button,\n\n437\n00:20:01.148 --> 00:20:04.820\nwe'll see a lot of the same stuff that we\nsaw with the physical network adapter.\n\n438\n00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.098\nTCPIP, DNS, WINS, 802.1x,\nproxies and hardware.\n\n439\n00:20:09.098 --> 00:20:12.160\nBut the Wi-Fi tab is new.\n\n440\n00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.610\nThat's the one that's\nkind of added on here,\n\n441\n00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.480\nand you'll see a bunch of options in here.\n\n442\n00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.260\nFirst off, you'll see where it's saved\nevery network that I've ever connected to.\n\n443\n00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.296\nSo, I stayed at\nthe MandarinOriental two years ago,\n\n444\n00:20:24.296 --> 00:20:28.640\nand it's still got an entry here,\ncuz I connected to it two years ago.\n\n445\n00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.430\nAnd so, the next time I go to the Mandarin\nOriental, which will probably be never.\n\n446\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.030\nBut the next time I go there,\nit'll automatically connect up, and\n\n447\n00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:36.490\nI'll be on that network.\n\n448\n00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:38.080\nOr there's Pezet-Private.\n\n449\n00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.510\nThat's actually my network at home.\n\n450\n00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:40.960\nSo when I go home,\nit can access the network.\n\n451\n00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.710\nIt remembers it,\n\n452\n00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.510\nit stored my WPA2 personal key to\nbe able to connect to that network.\n\n453\n00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:49.460\nAnd I can go in there and get right on it\nor if I want to print to Tim's printer.\n\n454\n00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.410\nThat's right there,\nI don't remember connecting to that but\n\n455\n00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.760\napparently I did, it's in my list.\n\n456\n00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.590\nSo, you can drag and drop these.\n\n457\n00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.540\nBecause sometimes you might be in\na location where there's more than\n\n458\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.790\none wireless network and so\nhere you can define that preference.\n\n459\n00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:06.900\nI might prefer ITProTV, so\nI'm gonna drag it and put it at the top.\n\n460\n00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.700\nMy home network is next, well, those\nare two completely separate locations, so\n\n461\n00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.610\nI would never see both at the same time.\n\n462\n00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:16.900\nBut Tim's printer,\nthat's just right there in his office.\n\n463\n00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.770\nI see Tim's printer and the ITProTV\nnetwork at the same time all the time.\n\n464\n00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.190\nAnd so I wanna make sure that Tim's\nprinter is beneath ITProTv, so\n\n465\n00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.490\nI'll prefer ITProTV.\n\n466\n00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.400\nAnd only use Tim's printer\nif I can't see ITProTV,\n\n467\n00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.180\nyou set that preference by dragging and\ndropping.\n\n468\n00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.640\n&gt;&gt; You know where this\ncomes in real handy,\n\n469\n00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.500\nis a lot of times people don't\nchange the default SSIDs.\n\n470\n00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.655\nThey get a Linksys router and\nthey fire it up, and it's called Linksys.\n\n471\n00:21:42.655 --> 00:21:44.616\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And then you're in maybe in the same\n\n472\n00:21:44.616 --> 00:21:49.510\nvicinity, somebody has also got a Linksys\nrouter and they never changed the SSID.\n\n473\n00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.438\nAnd its called Linksys and\nwhoever responds first-\n\n474\n00:21:52.438 --> 00:21:53.072\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n\n475\n00:21:53.072 --> 00:21:55.725\n&gt;&gt; If they're open and they respond\nwith DHCP, whoever responds first,\n\n476\n00:21:55.725 --> 00:21:57.722\nthat's the connection you're gonna make,\nright?\n\n477\n00:21:57.722 --> 00:22:02.444\nSo, to put yours to know, well, that's\nmy Linksys and push it up in the list,\n\n478\n00:22:02.444 --> 00:22:06.153\nyou know you're always gonna connect\nto that first even if you see\n\n479\n00:22:06.153 --> 00:22:11.170\nan identical kinda help deflect, evil\ntwin kinda stuff, a little more security.\n\n480\n00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, it is frustrating.\n\n481\n00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.610\nA lot of people don't know to\nsecure networks and we all suffer.\n\n482\n00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.460\nSome of the other stuff\nthat we've got here,\n\n483\n00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.170\nI can turn off remembering the network.\n\n484\n00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:23.379\nI don't have to remember them and\nyou can do that.\n\n485\n00:22:23.379 --> 00:22:27.310\nIf you don't wanna remember network, I'm\nreally not going back to MandarinOriental.\n\n486\n00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.295\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so I can choose that one.\n\n487\n00:22:29.295 --> 00:22:30.080\nI can just delete it.\n\n488\n00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.540\nYou know what?\nI don't need to keep it in the list.\n\n489\n00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.430\nWe can get rid of that one.\n\n490\n00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.503\n&gt;&gt; That continental breakfast\njust wasn't worth it, was it.\n\n491\n00:22:34.503 --> 00:22:36.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a very expensive hotel.\n\n492\n00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.250\n&gt;&gt; Was it really?\n&gt;&gt; I had to go there for\n\n493\n00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:41.318\na conference, so that-\n&gt;&gt; This is why he's never going back.\n\n494\n00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:42.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's more money than I had spent on\n\n495\n00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.502\na hotel-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah, yeah.\n\n496\n00:22:43.502 --> 00:22:45.557\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's why I know I'm \u0010not going back.\n\n497\n00:22:45.557 --> 00:22:46.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n498\n00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.100\n&gt;&gt; Some of the other stuff,\n\n499\n00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.625\nwe've got require administrator\nauthorization to create\n\n500\n00:22:50.625 --> 00:22:51.440\ncomputer-to-computer network.\n\n501\n00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.430\nSo when I created an ad hoc network, it\nnever did prompt me as an administrator,\n\n502\n00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:56.690\nso I can turn that on.\n\n503\n00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.726\nWe can require an administrator\nto change networks.\n\n504\n00:22:59.726 --> 00:23:02.000\nAnd we can require an administrator\nto turn Wi-Fi on and off.\n\n505\n00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.447\nThose are some of the advanced options\nwe've got to tweak that behavior of Wi-Fi.\n\n506\n00:23:05.447 --> 00:23:10.257\nAnd another thing that's not really on\nthe exam, but you might see in real life,\n\n507\n00:23:10.257 --> 00:23:13.042\nis that you can use\nApple's profile manager.\n\n508\n00:23:13.042 --> 00:23:16.831\nOr their configurator to actually\ncreate wireless configuration and\n\n509\n00:23:16.831 --> 00:23:18.800\npush them out to your devices.\n\n510\n00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.110\nSo we can assign certificates that way or\nassign SSIDs and their associated keys.\n\n511\n00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.410\nSo that when you give\nsomebody a new laptop,\n\n512\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:29.650\nit's already set up to connect all\nthe wireless networks in your company.\n\n513\n00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.188\nThat kind of thing can be automated\nas part of this configuration\n\n514\n00:23:32.188 --> 00:23:32.894\nprocess as well.\n\n515\n00:23:32.894 --> 00:23:36.708\nSo if you wanna learn more about that,\nthe Apple Profile Manager,\n\n516\n00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:39.580\nit can take care of a lot\nof really amazing things.\n\n517\n00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.472\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff.\n\n518\n00:23:40.472 --> 00:23:42.288\nDon, I don't know about you, but\n\n519\n00:23:42.288 --> 00:23:46.082\nI think that we actually made it\nthrough networking inside of our Macs.\n\n520\n00:23:46.082 --> 00:23:47.445\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We should now have a pretty\n\n521\n00:23:47.445 --> 00:23:51.633\nwell-rounded understanding of what goes\non when it comes to wireless hopefully.\n\n522\n00:23:51.633 --> 00:23:54.260\nThis is what this whole episode\nwas about but not just that.\n\n523\n00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:58.882\nThis whole networking little miniseries\nwe had going on with IP, TCPIP, IPv4 all\n\n524\n00:23:58.882 --> 00:24:03.452\nthe different protocols, all the different\nways in which they're connecting.\n\n525\n00:24:03.452 --> 00:24:04.493\nHow we can do that and\n\n526\n00:24:04.493 --> 00:24:08.306\nthen maybe even a little troubleshooting\nthrown on top for good measure.\n\n527\n00:24:08.306 --> 00:24:09.690\nHere we go, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n528\n00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:15.214\nThat's networking inside a Mac OS version\n10.12 and even some prior to that as well.\n\n529\n00:24:15.214 --> 00:24:17.620\nDon, anything else you wanna throw on\ntop of the heap before we call it a day?\n\n530\n00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.520\n&gt;&gt; I think that's about it.\n\n531\n00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.182\nThere is a lot more on the world of\nnetworking, but as far as the client side,\n\n532\n00:24:22.182 --> 00:24:24.569\nwe've pretty much seen all the options\nthat we're gonna run into.\n\n533\n00:24:24.569 --> 00:24:27.440\nAnd you just need to remember that\nevery network's a little different.\n\n534\n00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.168\nSo you may have to tweak things to get\nthem set up just the way your network\n\n535\n00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:30.682\nneeds them.\n\n536\n00:24:30.682 --> 00:24:32.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don,\nthanks for joining us today.\n\n537\n00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.557\nWe do thank our good audience for\nwatching.\n\n538\n00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:38.650\nBut like I said,\nwe found that ending spot for networking.\n\n539\n00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:39.463\nHope you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n540\n00:24:39.463 --> 00:24:42.039\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie\n\n541\n00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:43.092\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n542\n00:24:43.092 --> 00:24:44.118\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n543\n00:24:44.118 --> 00:24:51.038\n[MUSIC]\n\n544\n00:24:51.038 --> 00:24:53.436\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.540\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.245\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:13.126\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:15.433\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:19.804\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode, well, hopefully you're back for\n\n8\n00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:22.773\nmore ACSP because,\nwell that is what we are doing today, and\n\n9\n00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:25.660\njoining us in the studio,\nour good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.515\nDon, welcome back man.\n\n11\n00:00:26.515 --> 00:00:27.230\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.940\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, Daniel, and\n\n13\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.860\nI am ready to drop a bombshell\non the audience today.\n\n14\n00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.933\nI know we did three parts of network\nsolutions, configuration, all that stuff,\n\n15\n00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:39.533\nand it seemed like we got through it all,\nbut there were actually a couple\n\n16\n00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.564\nlittle items we didn't get to\nthat are somewhat important.\n\n17\n00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:43.869\nNow, these are optional items so\n\n18\n00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:46.490\nwe're going to call this advanced\nnetwork configuration today.\n\n19\n00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.580\nThese are features that not\neveryone takes advantage of.\n\n20\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.666\nAnd it may be something that you find you\ncan make really useful, or you may not.\n\n21\n00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.670\nBut we need to know them,\none because they're there and they work.\n\n22\n00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.833\nAnd two because they're on the exam.\n\n23\n00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:02.575\n[LAUGH] So we're going to take a look at\na couple of neat little features as we run\n\n24\n00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:05.631\nthrough the episode,\nstarting out with network locations and\n\n25\n00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.810\nthen kind of ending up with VPIs.\n\n26\n00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.584\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's interesting.\n\n27\n00:01:08.584 --> 00:01:10.087\nNetwork locations, I mean,\n\n28\n00:01:10.087 --> 00:01:13.065\nisn't the location of my\nnetwork wherever it might be?\n\n29\n00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:14.928\nIs that what we're talking about.\n\n30\n00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:19.145\n&gt;&gt; So what we run into is there's really\ntwo different network configurations when\n\n31\n00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.505\nyou think about it.\n\n32\n00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:22.976\nThere's a configuration\nthat's tied to your card and\n\n33\n00:01:22.976 --> 00:01:25.940\nthere's the configuration that's\ntied to the network itself.\n\n34\n00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.620\nAnd that can be a bit problematic,\nand let me give you an example, right?\n\n35\n00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.464\nSo, at home I have a wireless router and\nit hands out DHCP address,\n\n36\n00:01:34.464 --> 00:01:36.031\ndynamic addresses.\n\n37\n00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:36.934\nSo when I go home and\n\n38\n00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:40.610\nI'm on my home network I just want to\nget the dynamic address, that's fine.\n\n39\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.329\nBut when I come here to the office,\nI want to have a static address and\n\n40\n00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.245\nI think I showed that in an earlier\nepisode where I have my little network\n\n41\n00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:51.470\ndongle here and\nit's got a static address assigned to it.\n\n42\n00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.480\nActually, I think I turned it off in\nthat episode, so, let's revisit that.\n\n43\n00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.231\nWell, here, let's go into NC.\n\n44\n00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:59.889\nI'm go into my system preferences and\nin my system preferences,\n\n45\n00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:01.890\nI take my network adapter, right?\n\n46\n00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.220\nSo, I'm going to go down\nhere into networking.\n\n47\n00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.574\nAnd I'm going to find my thunder\nbolt ethernet adapter, and\n\n48\n00:02:06.574 --> 00:02:08.691\nI'm going to switch it to a manual IP.\n\n49\n00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:13.583\nI want it to be a particular address so\nthat I can always remember what it is,\n\n50\n00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:16.705\nand now I know that it's\ngot the right address.\n\n51\n00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:20.080\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\napply that, and get that set.\n\n52\n00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.180\nAnd we'll give that just a second.\n\n53\n00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.450\nAnd there we go all right.\n\n54\n00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.850\nSo, now I've got a manual\nIP I've got what I want.\n\n55\n00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.720\nBut if I take my laptop and I go home,\nI'm not set for DHCP anymore.\n\n56\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.199\nMy laptop is gonna be\n10.0.222.221 at home well\n\n57\n00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.639\nthat's not the network I use at home,\nright?\n\n58\n00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.660\nI use 192.168.0 like everybody else,\nright?\n\n59\n00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.000\nSo, [LAUGH] I have a different network\nconfiguration at home than I do here.\n\n60\n00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.779\nBut by default you can only have\none configuration per adapter.\n\n61\n00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:54.452\nSo, if I have my adapter set to DHCP I\ncan get a dynamic address at home and\n\n62\n00:02:54.452 --> 00:02:57.040\nI can get a dynamic address here and\nit works fine.\n\n63\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.789\nI just stay at DHCP.\n\n64\n00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:03.446\nBut if I want a static IP at one location\nand a dynamic IP at another location, or\n\n65\n00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:06.976\nif I want two different static IPs,\none static IP at work and\n\n66\n00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:08.830\na different static IP at home.\n\n67\n00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.634\nHow do I do that?\n\n68\n00:03:09.634 --> 00:03:11.604\nI don't want anything to go in here and\n\n69\n00:03:11.604 --> 00:03:15.620\nedit my network settings every time I go\nback and forth between home and work.\n\n70\n00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.422\nAnd so, that's where network\nlocations come in and it's\n\n71\n00:03:18.422 --> 00:03:22.671\nan easily overlooked feature because a lot\nof people just use DHCP everywhere, right?\n\n72\n00:03:22.671 --> 00:03:24.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you just keep that turned on.\n\n73\n00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.977\n&gt;&gt; But for your advanced users,\nfor your system administrators,\n\n74\n00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:30.603\nfor people that have firewall rules that\nspecifically allow certain hosts to go out\n\n75\n00:03:30.603 --> 00:03:32.542\nthat's where you start running into this.\n\n76\n00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:35.290\nAnd so\nwe need those multiple configurations.\n\n77\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.282\nSo to show you that here in my system\npreferences if I just scroll up a little\n\n78\n00:03:38.282 --> 00:03:39.800\nbit, I had conveniently hidden it.\n\n79\n00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.540\nYou've got location, right?\n\n80\n00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.500\nWhen you do a brand new install of Mac OS\nand you haven't dinked around with it or\n\n81\n00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.170\nanything, you'll see this location\nwhere it says automatic, right?\n\n82\n00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.998\nAnd that means, by default, it's going to\nhave one configuration for each adapter\n\n83\n00:03:54.998 --> 00:04:00.070\nand it's going to be set up with whatever\nconfiguration I've got put in right here.\n\n84\n00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.610\nThis is automatic management\nof those locations.\n\n85\n00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.702\nBut it's not really suitable when you have\ndifferent configurations at different\n\n86\n00:04:06.702 --> 00:04:07.650\nnetworks.\n\n87\n00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.460\nAnd so what you can do is you can drop\nthat down and edit your locations.\n\n88\n00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.491\nAnd you can start to create custom\nlocations that have different\n\n89\n00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:17.990\nconfigurations for the different adaptors.\n\n90\n00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.680\nSo if I do that,\nlike I'll choose edit locations.\n\n91\n00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.930\nAnd I'm going to add in home,\nand I'll add in work.\n\n92\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.540\nSo now I've got these two locations\ncreated here, home and work.\n\n93\n00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.256\nAnd if I modify any of those, well,\n\n94\n00:04:31.256 --> 00:04:33.440\nthere's not really all\nthat much to modify.\n\n95\n00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.509\nIf I take Home and I hit the little gear,\nyou can see I can duplicate it or\n\n96\n00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:37.245\nI can rename it.\n\n97\n00:04:37.245 --> 00:04:40.200\nNot a whole lot to go on there, right?\n\n98\n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.315\nBecause what's going to happen is\nI need to set a configuration for\n\n99\n00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:43.200\neach individual adaptor.\n\n100\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.078\nSo if you hit Done, and go back here,\nnow I can pick between the adapters and\n\n101\n00:04:48.078 --> 00:04:51.563\nstart to get them configured\nto how I want them to be and\n\n102\n00:04:51.563 --> 00:04:55.150\nI can switch between automatic,\nhome and work.\n\n103\n00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.230\nNow remember that\nautomatic is where I was.\n\n104\n00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.525\nThat's where all of my\nother configurations were.\n\n105\n00:04:59.525 --> 00:05:01.870\nSo [INAUDIBLE] configuration.\n\n106\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.230\nIf I switch to home.\n\n107\n00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.570\nWatch what happens to\nmy adapters over here.\n\n108\n00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.315\nAnd it takes just a second to refresh,\nthere we go, all right.\n\n109\n00:05:09.315 --> 00:05:14.200\nNotice how everything kind of reset and\nwent back to what would be my\n\n110\n00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.090\nvery original defaults from when\nMac OS was first installed.\n\n111\n00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.121\nIn an earlier episode,\n\n112\n00:05:20.121 --> 00:05:23.270\nI bumped the thunderbolt ethernet\nadapter up to have a higher priority.\n\n113\n00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.896\nAnd I had moved WiFi around, and\nI assigned a static IP all those\n\n114\n00:05:26.896 --> 00:05:31.830\nsettings are gone, well they're not\ngone they're just part of automatic.\n\n115\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.469\n&gt;&gt; So it's like a profile that says\nwhen I'm in this spot or I'm at work or\n\n116\n00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.430\nI'm at home this is the way I want it set\nup and you can switch between the two.\n\n117\n00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.319\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it yeah, so\nI can come in here and say for\n\n118\n00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.135\nhome I want the thunderbolt ethernet\nto be the highest priority right, so\n\n119\n00:05:46.135 --> 00:05:48.000\nI'm going to hit my hear down here.\n\n120\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.542\nAnd I'll choose to set the service order.\n\n121\n00:05:51.542 --> 00:05:54.450\nAnd I'm going to take that\nthunderbolt ethernet and\n\n122\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.700\nas soon as my happy little\ncolor wheel stops, there we go.\n\n123\n00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.150\nI'll move it up to the top.\n\n124\n00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.910\nIt's always the hardest to\nmove something to the top.\n\n125\n00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.001\nThere, I'll move thunderbolt\nethernet to the top.\n\n126\n00:06:03.001 --> 00:06:07.279\nI'll go ahead and move WiFi to second\nplace, so I've got those set up and\n\n127\n00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:11.150\nit's my home network so\nI just want to use DHCP for those, right?\n\n128\n00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.621\nSo I've got DHCP for thunderbolt ethernet\nand I'll have DHCP for wireless and\n\n129\n00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:19.764\non wireless you've got the full set\nof configuration options in there.\n\n130\n00:06:19.764 --> 00:06:23.089\nSo I can even define different ssid's and\npasswords and\n\n131\n00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:26.000\nthings that I want to use for\nconnecting to that.\n\n132\n00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.200\nI'm being a little impatient and\nclicking too fast here.\n\n133\n00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.909\nBut you do have to wait a little bit for\nit to kind of sort and\n\n134\n00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:33.444\nget all this stuff put in place.\n\n135\n00:06:33.444 --> 00:06:36.807\nBut there we go, so now I can go into\nwi-fi and I can start to tweak and\n\n136\n00:06:36.807 --> 00:06:40.800\nconfigure all these as needed to get\nit set the way that we want it to be.\n\n137\n00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.730\nNow, I've got my home set up for\nDHCP, that's great.\n\n138\n00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.287\nI can switch to work, and under work,\nI'll give it a second here to load.\n\n139\n00:06:49.287 --> 00:06:52.331\nIt's going to kind of put itself back and\nnow I can go in and\n\n140\n00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:55.940\nstart to get this configured\nthe way that I want it at work.\n\n141\n00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.160\nMaybe at home, at home I'm never\ngoing to plug in a physical adapter.\n\n142\n00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.710\nMaybe I'm always gonna use wireless right?\n\n143\n00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.326\nSo back under the home network I\nmight want to come back here and\n\n144\n00:07:04.326 --> 00:07:07.050\nmake wireless the highest priority, right?\n\n145\n00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.408\nSo I can take Wi-Fi when\nI do my service order.\n\n146\n00:07:10.408 --> 00:07:12.700\nI'll bump Wi-Fi back up to the top.\n\n147\n00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.563\nOr it's probably easier to drag\nThunderbolt Ethernet down one.\n\n148\n00:07:17.563 --> 00:07:20.310\nIt's hard to get the mouse kinda in\nthe right spot to get it into the top.\n\n149\n00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.280\nSo there,\nI'll make Wi-Fi the top priority for home.\n\n150\n00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.722\nAnd I'm going to give that\njust a second to refresh so\n\n151\n00:07:24.722 --> 00:07:26.173\nthe wi-fi bumps up to the top.\n\n152\n00:07:26.173 --> 00:07:30.060\nAnd then I'll take my work side, and\nI'll take wi-fi and make it second place.\n\n153\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.230\nBecause I wan to prefer my\nThunderbolt adaptor at work.\n\n154\n00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.110\nThere we go, so now home is set.\n\n155\n00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.230\nI'll jump back to work.\n\n156\n00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.912\nAnd on the work side,\nas soon as it updates here,\n\n157\n00:07:37.912 --> 00:07:39.070\nI'll change the service order.\n\n158\n00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.429\nAnd at home,\nI set both my adapters for DHCP.\n\n159\n00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:46.540\nBut at work,\nmaybe I wanna have that static IP, right?\n\n160\n00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.420\nSo I can come in here and get all\nthat set just the way that I want it.\n\n161\n00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.537\nSo I'm going to bump Wi-Fi up to the top.\n\n162\n00:07:54.537 --> 00:07:58.600\nAnd then I'll take my Thunderbolt Ethernet\nright here, I'll bump it up to the top.\n\n163\n00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.358\nI'll try, there we go.\n\n164\n00:08:00.358 --> 00:08:05.860\nSo there's my service order set,\ndifferently than my home order was, right?\n\n165\n00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.470\nAnd now, as soon as it updates, I can go\ninto my Thunderbolt ethernet adapter, and\n\n166\n00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.000\nI can set the static IP\naddress that I wanna have.\n\n167\n00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.561\nAnd so at work when I plug in,\nI'll have the static IP I want.\n\n168\n00:08:16.561 --> 00:08:19.975\nAt home, if I were to plug in,\nI would get a dynamic IP.\n\n169\n00:08:19.975 --> 00:08:22.530\nI've got the different configuration for\neach location.\n\n170\n00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.706\nSo I'll take that Thunderbolt ethernet,\nand\n\n171\n00:08:24.706 --> 00:08:27.790\nlet me just switch that\none to Manual assignment.\n\n172\n00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.510\nAnd punch in the IP that I want to use.\n\n173\n00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.565\nAnd all the other information\nthat goes along with it.\n\n174\n00:08:36.565 --> 00:08:40.390\nWe'd assign IP address,\nDNS servers, all that other stuff.\n\n175\n00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.990\nWe do need to apply that before we\ncan go in and assign the DNS Server.\n\n176\n00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.160\nSo I'll get that punched in.\n\n177\n00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.930\nAnd once that's done,\nthen we're ready to rock.\n\n178\n00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.915\nNow, once that's put in place,\n\n179\n00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:59.130\nokay, now I've got my configurations kinda\ndefined the way that I want them to be.\n\n180\n00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.440\nI can just hit Apply, and that's gonna\ngo ahead and get itself locked in.\n\n181\n00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:09.000\nAnd once that's done, there we go,\nnow I've got my networks defined, right?\n\n182\n00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.460\nAnd up here, when I look at my menu,\nright, I just see my standard connections.\n\n183\n00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.260\nThat all looks the same, everything\nthat we're used to, looks the same.\n\n184\n00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.390\nBut when I go home, if I want,\nI can go to my home machine,\n\n185\n00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.470\nI can bring down my menu, and\njump over to my network preferences.\n\n186\n00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:31.515\nAnd I can quickly flip\nthis from Work to Home.\n\n187\n00:09:31.515 --> 00:09:35.359\nAnd now my entire configuration's gonna\nchange and match what I have at home.\n\n188\n00:09:35.359 --> 00:09:38.548\nAnd when I go to work,\nall I've gotta do is come up here and\n\n189\n00:09:38.548 --> 00:09:40.880\nquickly flip this from Home back to Work.\n\n190\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.570\nAnd then we can put that in place, and\nnow it's in place and we've switched over.\n\n191\n00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.554\nAnd we've got our new configuration, and\n\n192\n00:09:46.554 --> 00:09:49.170\nthings are working the way\nthat we want them to be.\n\n193\n00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:53.724\nSo, all those configuration settings\nare very easily able to port from one to\n\n194\n00:09:53.724 --> 00:09:54.434\nthe other.\n\n195\n00:09:54.434 --> 00:09:55.670\nNow you do still have automatic.\n\n196\n00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.680\nYou can still flip back\nto automatic if you want.\n\n197\n00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.294\nAnd any new adaptor that you\nadd will go into automatic and\n\n198\n00:10:01.294 --> 00:10:04.990\nget automatically configured, and\nthen you'd go in and customize it.\n\n199\n00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.940\nAnd then you'll have to go to\nchoose to add in to work or\n\n200\n00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.360\nhome or whatever your other profile is.\n\n201\n00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.530\nAny other network adaptors\nthat you want to have.\n\n202\n00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.596\nBut once they're done,\nthey're in there and you're in place.\n\n203\n00:10:14.596 --> 00:10:15.956\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty simple,\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n204\n00:10:15.956 --> 00:10:18.385\nAll you have to do is figure out\nhow you want them to be set up.\n\n205\n00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:23.590\nNow you have the ability to go in and\ndo that, can be actually very, very handy.\n\n206\n00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.180\nDon, anything else about\nthe network locations?\n\n207\n00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.970\n&gt;&gt; I showed changing the location\nthrough the network utility,\n\n208\n00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.168\nwhich is something you might be thinking,\nugh,\n\n209\n00:10:30.168 --> 00:10:33.133\nis there a way to avoid going into\nthe network utility every time?\n\n210\n00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.987\nThat's usually the way I do it,\njust because it's right there and\n\n211\n00:10:34.987 --> 00:10:35.791\nit's quick and it's easy.\n\n212\n00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:37.542\nBut there is another way to get to it.\n\n213\n00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:40.702\nIf you go to your Apple menu up top,\nright under your Apple menu,\n\n214\n00:10:40.702 --> 00:10:43.814\nyou'll see Location, and\nthere you've got the options too.\n\n215\n00:10:43.814 --> 00:10:45.118\nOkay-\n&gt;&gt; So quick jump.\n\n216\n00:10:45.118 --> 00:10:50.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've got this habit of going\nin to the network system preferences.\n\n217\n00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.110\nBut if you want, on your Apple\nmenu under location, right there.\n\n218\n00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.590\nYou'll see each of your options that\nyou can pick and choose and go to,\n\n219\n00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.120\nand off you go.\n\n220\n00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.210\nNow do be aware that once you've\ndefined locations like I have,\n\n221\n00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.430\nthe default behavior of\nthe system starts to change.\n\n222\n00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:10.190\nSo when I'm in a particular profile and\nI add a new adapter,\n\n223\n00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.340\nthat configuration's going into\nwhatever profile I'm in right then.\n\n224\n00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.658\nSo as I flip back and\nforth between profiles,\n\n225\n00:11:15.658 --> 00:11:18.107\nI can end up in a situation\nwhere I get confused.\n\n226\n00:11:18.107 --> 00:11:20.431\nI thought I put a static IP on\nthe network adapter and now it's gone.\n\n227\n00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:23.340\nOr, I thought, I was set for\nDHCP and now I'm not, or\n\n228\n00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.690\nsomething of that nature that can happen.\n\n229\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.640\nIt can get confusing.\n\n230\n00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.503\nAnd that's why I call this an advanced\nfeature that a lot of people are just\n\n231\n00:11:29.503 --> 00:11:30.528\ngonna stay in automatic.\n\n232\n00:11:30.528 --> 00:11:33.382\nAnd at home, they're gonna use DHCP and\nat work they're gonna use DHCP and\n\n233\n00:11:33.382 --> 00:11:34.258\nthat's the end of it.\n\n234\n00:11:34.258 --> 00:11:37.903\nOn a desktop, right,\nif you have an iMac or a Mac Pro or\n\n235\n00:11:37.903 --> 00:11:43.340\nif you've got a server set up, a Mac Mini,\nwe don't move those around, do we?\n\n236\n00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.820\nThey just stay in one place.\n\n237\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.950\nSo we're really talking about laptops,\nright?\n\n238\n00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.730\nMacBook Pros and MacBooks.\n\n239\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.600\nAnd for those types of users,\nthey're typically using wireless and\n\n240\n00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.450\nthey're typically dynamic.\n\n241\n00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.490\nSo this type of feature is not\nnecessarily gonna hit home with\n\n242\n00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.210\nevery single person that's out there.\n\n243\n00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.110\nAnd you'll see, even for\nme, this is my work laptop.\n\n244\n00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.111\nAnd I didn't have locations defined.\n\n245\n00:12:03.111 --> 00:12:06.845\nAnd that's because there is another\nway to kind of get around this,\n\n246\n00:12:06.845 --> 00:12:10.327\nwhich is you can still use DHCP,\ninstead of DHCP reservation.\n\n247\n00:12:10.327 --> 00:12:10.921\nAnd that's what I do.\n\n248\n00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:13.043\nSo when I come into the office,\nI always get the same IP.\n\n249\n00:12:13.043 --> 00:12:15.871\nNot because I've statically\nassigned it to my adapter, but\n\n250\n00:12:15.871 --> 00:12:17.817\nbecause the DHCP server gives me that IP.\n\n251\n00:12:17.817 --> 00:12:21.175\nBut if I go to Starbucks and I always\nwant to have the same IP at Starbucks,\n\n252\n00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:24.440\nI can't just ask them, hey,\ncan you guys give me a DHCP reservation?\n\n253\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.370\n&gt;&gt; Do a brother a solid.\n\n254\n00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.142\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n255\n00:12:26.142 --> 00:12:26.895\n&gt;&gt; They're not gonna do it.\n\n256\n00:12:26.895 --> 00:12:27.774\nThey can barely make a coffee.\n\n257\n00:12:27.774 --> 00:12:32.705\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE].\n\n258\n00:12:32.705 --> 00:12:36.109\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, so instead what\nthey're gonna do is laugh at you.\n\n259\n00:12:36.109 --> 00:12:38.719\nSo that's where you could\nhave a profile like this,\n\n260\n00:12:38.719 --> 00:12:41.510\nit makes it real easy to flip over and\nthere you go.\n\n261\n00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.780\nSo just be aware that feature is there,\nit is available and\n\n262\n00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.910\nit's actually kind of neat.\n\n263\n00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.261\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very cool and the shortcut\nis definitely, I love shortcuts.\n\n264\n00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:51.484\nThey're always very nice to\nknow exactly where those are,\n\n265\n00:12:51.484 --> 00:12:52.821\nmake your life a little bit easier.\n\n266\n00:12:52.821 --> 00:12:56.460\nNow speaking about making our lives\neasier, Don, you also mentioned VPN.\n\n267\n00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.179\nObviously, if you work from home a lot and\n\n268\n00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:03.299\nyou have to get into a network\nthat you don't technically own,\n\n269\n00:13:03.299 --> 00:13:07.516\nthat you're not directly connected to,\nVPNs can be a Godsend.\n\n270\n00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:10.018\nThey're just amazing,\nthey help out with that.\n\n271\n00:13:10.018 --> 00:13:13.976\nAre we saying that inside of MAC OS,\nwe have a VPN clients?\n\n272\n00:13:13.976 --> 00:13:15.426\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n273\n00:13:15.426 --> 00:13:16.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n274\n00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.170\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting.\n\n275\n00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.320\n&gt;&gt; VPNs are really a critical piece\nof infrastructure, because we do so\n\n276\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.300\nmuch business via the Internet these days.\n\n277\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.085\nAnd so many people travel and\nhave laptops and things.\n\n278\n00:13:26.085 --> 00:13:28.606\nAnd if I go home, I trust my home network.\n\n279\n00:13:28.606 --> 00:13:33.140\nBut I might need access to files and\nresources that are here at the office.\n\n280\n00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.790\nAnd if I'm at home,\nI can't get into those.\n\n281\n00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.060\nOr I might be at a hotel,\nat a conference center or\n\n282\n00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.900\nsomething like that ,and I\ndon't trust that network.\n\n283\n00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.100\nI don't know half the people,\n\n284\n00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.820\neven 99% of the people that are on\nthose networks, I don't know them.\n\n285\n00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.320\nAnd so I want to protect my data and\nensure that it's been encrypted and\n\n286\n00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:56.140\nkept safe on the network and virtual\nprivate network or VPN they do that.\n\n287\n00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:00.355\nWhat a VPN does it establish\na connection between your laptop and\n\n288\n00:14:00.355 --> 00:14:03.408\na server somewhere,\nusually at your office.\n\n289\n00:14:03.408 --> 00:14:08.013\nAnd it builds an encrypted tunnel\nbetween your laptop and that server.\n\n290\n00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:11.560\nAnd all of your information gets\nflowed over that encrypted tunnel.\n\n291\n00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.300\nIf somebody's on the untrusted network and\n\n292\n00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.950\nthey intercept your data,\nit's encrypted, it's protected.\n\n293\n00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:16.970\nWhat do you care, right?\n\n294\n00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:21.200\nSo, now you can take a network that's high\nrisk network, like a coffee shop network.\n\n295\n00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.900\nAnd you can use it safely.\n\n296\n00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.230\nNow in the past, what we've had to do\nis install third party VPN clients.\n\n297\n00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.760\nLike Cisco has Cisco AnyConnect.\n\n298\n00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.980\nAnd you can install the AnyConnect\nsoftware, and that's great.\n\n299\n00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.620\nThe challenge with something\nlike AnyConnect is\n\n300\n00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.000\nthere's no way to centrally manage\nit from inside of the Apple World.\n\n301\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.390\nSo if I'm using Profile Manager\nto push out profiles,\n\n302\n00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.460\nit doesn't have any settings in there for\nmanaging Cisco's AnyConnect.\n\n303\n00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.830\nAnd the other problem is that\nsometimes those vendors are slow to\n\n304\n00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.190\nupdate their software when new\nversions of Mac OS comes out.\n\n305\n00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.630\nSo I remember when\nMavericks first came out.\n\n306\n00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.330\nBoy, there were several VPN clients\nthat were broken due to some of\n\n307\n00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.500\nthe security changes.\n\n308\n00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.210\nAnd it was months before they were\nable to put out those updates.\n\n309\n00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:05.636\nNow, that's not a big deal if you\nwait to do your core OS update.\n\n310\n00:15:05.636 --> 00:15:08.622\nBut these days, as we have automatic\nupdates that are pushing things,\n\n311\n00:15:08.622 --> 00:15:11.377\nwe'll find oftentimes that our\nsystems update pretty quickly.\n\n312\n00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:13.434\nAnd now we break software\nlike VPN software.\n\n313\n00:15:13.434 --> 00:15:18.193\nSo fortunately, there's a couple of\nstandard VPN protocols that are out there.\n\n314\n00:15:18.193 --> 00:15:23.107\nAnd Apple has support for them built\nright here into our network preferences.\n\n315\n00:15:23.107 --> 00:15:24.943\nSo we can define the network settings for\n\n316\n00:15:24.943 --> 00:15:27.327\nthese VPNs right in line\nwith our network adapters.\n\n317\n00:15:27.327 --> 00:15:30.422\nAnd that's nice because we can\nmanage it via the profile manager.\n\n318\n00:15:30.422 --> 00:15:33.607\nAnd we don't have to worry about the next\ntime an update comes out for the system.\n\n319\n00:15:33.607 --> 00:15:35.888\nIt's part of the system, so\nit gets updated as well.\n\n320\n00:15:35.888 --> 00:15:40.076\nAnd you've got great, reliable VPN\nfunctionality right in your system,\n\n321\n00:15:40.076 --> 00:15:40.760\nall right?\n\n322\n00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.700\nSo let's take a look at how that works.\n\n323\n00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.910\nFirst off,\na virtual private network is virtual.\n\n324\n00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:46.970\nIt's not a real network.\n\n325\n00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:48.344\nSo I don't have a real adapter for it.\n\n326\n00:15:48.344 --> 00:15:51.326\nSo a VPN is not going to show\nup in your list by default.\n\n327\n00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:55.451\nI see a number of adapters that are real\nadapters like my Thunderbolt ethernet\n\n328\n00:15:55.451 --> 00:15:59.830\nadapter or my Wi-Fi These are physical\nadapters that are built into this system,\n\n329\n00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.610\nor that I've stuck on with a dongle.\n\n330\n00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.410\nBut I can hit the little plus sign\ndown here to add a new adapter.\n\n331\n00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.950\nNow how do we add a new adapter\nvirtually here in a screen,\n\n332\n00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.590\nif it's normally gonna\nbe a physical dongle?\n\n333\n00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.410\nNormally you plug in a physical dongle,\nand\n\n334\n00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.810\nit just detects a network adapter and\nshows up.\n\n335\n00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.990\nBut if you drop down a list on interfaces,\n\n336\n00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:22.720\nyou'll see down here at the bottom\na few options one of which is VPN.\n\n337\n00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.690\nI can add a virtual private\nnetwork connection.\n\n338\n00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:32.320\nAnd that VPN is the encrypted tunnel\nbetween me and a trusted network.\n\n339\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.168\nAnd like I said, it's normally gonna\nbe your work that you're VPNing it to.\n\n340\n00:16:36.168 --> 00:16:40.382\nThere's some people that go a little crazy\nlike myself where I actually have where I\n\n341\n00:16:40.382 --> 00:16:41.470\ncan VPN into my home.\n\n342\n00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:47.780\nSometimes I might be on vacation and I'm\non a wireless network that I don't trust.\n\n343\n00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.457\nI'm like, I could VPN into the office for\nme to browse the network and\n\n344\n00:16:51.457 --> 00:16:52.330\nwatch YouTube.\n\n345\n00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n346\n00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.520\nI don't wanna waste my work resources\non what's a personal activity so\n\n347\n00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.810\nI have it where I can VPN into my home.\n\n348\n00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:02.540\nAnd by doing that I trust my home network,\nI paid for\n\n349\n00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.380\nthe internet access there personally so I\ncan VPM in just to get a trusted network.\n\n350\n00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.190\nBut there's even third party services\nthat are out there like proXPN is one\n\n351\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.330\nwhere you can sign up for\nVPN services there.\n\n352\n00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:18.260\nWhere, again, you might be on an untrusted\nnetwork, and at least you can VPN through\n\n353\n00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.390\na service like them and\nthey give you Internet access and\n\n354\n00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.530\nyou know that you're protected\non that untrusted network.\n\n355\n00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.140\nYou're not protected on the Internet,\nthe Internet's a dangerous place, but\n\n356\n00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.820\nyou're protected on whatever network\nyou're directly connected to.\n\n357\n00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.452\nNow that won't give you access to your\nworkplace files and other resources.\n\n358\n00:17:32.452 --> 00:17:35.202\nIf you VPN in your work, you'll\ntypically have access to the servers and\n\n359\n00:17:35.202 --> 00:17:38.090\nprinters and other things that\nare right there on the work network.\n\n360\n00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.650\nAnd that really does help out if you're\ntrying to work from home, not so\n\n361\n00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.440\nmuch if you're on vacation.\n\n362\n00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.384\nBut when you add a VPN in here it is\nimportant to understand that there's many\n\n363\n00:17:47.384 --> 00:17:48.727\ndifferent types of VPNs.\n\n364\n00:17:48.727 --> 00:17:53.335\nAnd when you drop down that list,\nyou'll see a couple of different options.\n\n365\n00:17:53.335 --> 00:17:56.406\nThe three that are listed\nhere are actually standard\n\n366\n00:17:56.406 --> 00:18:01.238\nVPN protocols that are supported by a\nnumber of different companies and systems.\n\n367\n00:18:01.238 --> 00:18:06.710\nYou've got L2TP of IPSec,\nCisco IPSec, and IKEv2.\n\n368\n00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.410\nTechnically, all three of these\nare forms of IPsec, IPsec stands for\n\n369\n00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.590\ninternet protocol security.\n\n370\n00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.820\nAnd what IPSec is is not an algorithm,\nit's not a formula or\n\n371\n00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.570\na protocol even, it's a framework,\nit's a collection of protocols.\n\n372\n00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.830\nIPSec lets two computers\ntalk to each other and\n\n373\n00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:29.670\nchoose an encryption algorithm,\na hashing signature algorithm.\n\n374\n00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.700\nIt lets them handle negotiations for\nkey exchange.\n\n375\n00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.980\nAnd one more thing,\nwhat's the fourth thing that it does.\n\n376\n00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.840\nIt's not on the exam but\njust for my own personal,\n\n377\n00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.350\nI thought I could rattle off\nfour off the top of my head.\n\n378\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:46.041\nSo, signature, key exchange,\nencryption, and one more thing.\n\n379\n00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:48.400\n[LAUGH] That other thing.\n\n380\n00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.750\nSo they negotiate these four things and\nof the four things,\n\n381\n00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.720\nthere's a number of choices.\n\n382\n00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.870\nThere's probably 15 different\nencryption algorithms.\n\n383\n00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.390\nI know there's six or\nseven different hashing algorithms.\n\n384\n00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.510\nThe key exchange, there's a good four\ndifferent methods of key exchange.\n\n385\n00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.500\nSo in order for\ntwo computers to build up a VPN tunnel,\n\n386\n00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.180\nthey've gotta pick the same values for all\nthose, so there's a lot of combinations.\n\n387\n00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.020\nAnd IPSec handles that\nnegotiation to figure out\n\n388\n00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.770\nthe right protocol to use\nto let them communicate.\n\n389\n00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.680\nThe first one here is L2TP over IPSec and\n\n390\n00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:22.410\nwhat that is the layer two\ntunneling protocol over IPSec.\n\n391\n00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.428\nIt lets two computers, or\na computer and a VPN server connect.\n\n392\n00:19:26.428 --> 00:19:29.430\nThey use IPSec to negotiate\nthe connection, and\n\n393\n00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.190\nthen they put L2TP on top of it.\n\n394\n00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:37.140\nAnd what L2TP is, is taking over all\nthe layer two communications for\n\n395\n00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.690\nyour systems and putting layer three and\nhigher inside of it.\n\n396\n00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:45.080\nNow if you're not familiar with the USI\nmodel, basically, you have your hardware\n\n397\n00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.450\nat layer one, you have your MAC addresses\nand your LINQ layer at layer two.\n\n398\n00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.630\nSo those all are really\nlow level communications.\n\n399\n00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.070\nAnd at layer three,\nis where you have Internet Protocol,\n\n400\n00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.880\nyour IP addresses, right?\n\n401\n00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.060\nLayer four is your transport, and\n\n402\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.400\nthat's where you have things like TCP and\nUDP that run.\n\n403\n00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.660\nSo layer three and higher is what\nactually drives our software.\n\n404\n00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.710\nLayer one and two is usually\nbelow the operating system and\n\n405\n00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.580\nit's what it's using to actually\nget on to the physical network.\n\n406\n00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.030\nSo layer one and layer two,\nget obfuscated by L2TP and\n\n407\n00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.660\neverything above it,\ngets thrown over the tunnel.\n\n408\n00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.233\nSo L2TP is nice cuz it\ncan carry every protocol.\n\n409\n00:20:18.233 --> 00:20:21.080\nIt can carry TCP IP, IPX SPX, Apple talk,\n\n410\n00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:26.080\nprotocols that most of us don't use\nanymore, but TCIP being the main one.\n\n411\n00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.030\nBut it can carry that and it works with\nmostly Windows systems is really where you\n\n412\n00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.260\nsee this one get leverage.\n\n413\n00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.190\nBut it can be used by some other places.\n\n414\n00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.780\nCisco IPSec this is Cisco's\nimplementation of IPSec,\n\n415\n00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.590\nwhich actually still is standards\ncompliant but it handles\n\n416\n00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:45.860\noff of a separate level of authentication\nthat a lot of people don't use.\n\n417\n00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:50.230\nCisco IPSec is very widely supported\nby a number of different companies, so\n\n418\n00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.200\nthat's why it's here as an option.\n\n419\n00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.658\nBut most people have moved to\nthe third option, which is IKEv2.\n\n420\n00:20:56.658 --> 00:21:01.380\nIKE stands for Internet Key Exchange or\nIntranetwork Key Exchange.\n\n421\n00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:07.950\nAnd it's basically a framework that\npowers IPSec, so it's again still IPSec.\n\n422\n00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:12.790\nAnd Cisco IPSec technically uses IKEv1 and\nhere's IKEv2 and so\n\n423\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.440\nthey are all closely related.\n\n424\n00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.730\nBut with IKEv2 when you choose it,\nyou can connect to another system and\n\n425\n00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.490\nnegotiate at all these different levels\nof encryption and communication.\n\n426\n00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.770\nAnd so this works when connecting to\nWindows environments, and Macs, and\n\n427\n00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:27.980\nCisco, and Juniper.\n\n428\n00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.000\nEven Cisco's moved over to IKEv2 for\nalmost all of their stuff, so\n\n429\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.380\nthis is probably the most\ncommonly used solution.\n\n430\n00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.970\n&gt;&gt; Don, is this like wireless encryptions,\n\n431\n00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.770\nwere you've got all these older\nstandards that are still available, but\n\n432\n00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.130\nyou really just want to go\nwith the latest and greatest?\n\n433\n00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.990\nIf at all possible.\n\n434\n00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.700\n&gt;&gt; Well that is true except in this\ncase with IPSec because you can pick and\n\n435\n00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.830\nchoose parts,\nunlike with wireless encryption where WEP\n\n436\n00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:53.030\nonly uses one type of encryption and\nWPA only uses one type of encryption.\n\n437\n00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.670\nSo when they were broken you had to\nmove to WPA2, a whole new protocol.\n\n438\n00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.810\nWith IKE, or with IPSec you can just\nsay all right this one is broken let\n\n439\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.450\nme swap out that encryption piece.\n\n440\n00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.160\nAnd so it's technically still\nthe same IPSec we've always had,\n\n441\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.350\nwe've just swapped out some of the pieces.\n\n442\n00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.620\nNow when I choose to set something up like\nthis, so I'm gonna add an IKEv2 connection\n\n443\n00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:15.330\nfor VPN to Work, it's not as easy as just\nhitting create and you're done right?\n\n444\n00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.810\nYou need to reach out to your\nnetwork administrators and\n\n445\n00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.890\nsay what values do I put in here?\n\n446\n00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.730\nWhat is my server address?\n\n447\n00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:25.790\nSo you'll have your vpn.workdomain.com or\nsomething like that?\n\n448\n00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.870\nYour remote ID and local ID,\nthis is you authenticating yourself.\n\n449\n00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.100\nAnd your remote ID might\nbe your workstation name,\n\n450\n00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.230\nit might be your user name.\n\n451\n00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.520\nIt'll be some credential that they\ngive you that you'll provide there.\n\n452\n00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.980\nAnd then you go in your\nauthentication settings and\n\n453\n00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:43.050\nin your authentication settings,\nyou'll define a user name and password.\n\n454\n00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.360\nThere's actually two separate\nstages of authentication.\n\n455\n00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.530\nOne authentication says\ncan I bring the tunnel up?\n\n456\n00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.480\nAnd that's what this\nremote ID part is doing.\n\n457\n00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.460\nAnd the second level is saying I am\nthis person so give me my access.\n\n458\n00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.536\nSo what are you allowed\nto do on the tunnel?\n\n459\n00:22:58.536 --> 00:23:01.310\nThis is two stages of\nauthentication in the VPN.\n\n460\n00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:05.125\nThey call it phase one and\nphase two of building a VPN tunnel.\n\n461\n00:23:05.125 --> 00:23:07.483\nNot on the exam, just so you know\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n462\n00:23:07.483 --> 00:23:08.287\n&gt;&gt; So anyhow, so\n\n463\n00:23:08.287 --> 00:23:11.841\nwe provide that authentication to\nbe able to reach out there and\n\n464\n00:23:11.841 --> 00:23:13.335\nconnect to that network.\n\n465\n00:23:13.335 --> 00:23:17.055\nNow the nice part about this is you can\nchoose to show the VPN status in the menu\n\n466\n00:23:17.055 --> 00:23:19.045\nbar, and once we have done that.\n\n467\n00:23:19.045 --> 00:23:21.677\nI am going to go ahead and\nturn that on, I need to set my IDs.\n\n468\n00:23:21.677 --> 00:23:22.367\n&gt;&gt; No you're not.\n\n469\n00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:23.315\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n470\n00:23:23.315 --> 00:23:25.170\nI'll just give it a fake ID here.\n\n471\n00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.530\nI'm gonna go ahead and apply that.\n\n472\n00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.631\nAnd once it's done for your user,\n\n473\n00:23:28.631 --> 00:23:31.756\nall they have to do is look\nup here at their menu bar.\n\n474\n00:23:31.756 --> 00:23:33.669\nAnd they'll have this little icon,\n\n475\n00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:37.860\nand I've never been able to figure out\nwhat the heck this icon is supposed to be.\n\n476\n00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:38.450\n&gt;&gt; Is it a tunnel?\n\n477\n00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:40.190\n&gt;&gt; Maybe?\n\n478\n00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.931\nI guess.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, yeah, maybe a tunnel.\n\n479\n00:23:43.931 --> 00:23:46.089\n&gt;&gt; It's something, maybe a box.\nSo, but, you can look at it, and\n\n480\n00:23:46.089 --> 00:23:48.807\nif it's black like this,\nyou're not connected.\n\n481\n00:23:48.807 --> 00:23:51.625\nAnd when you drop it down,\nyou can connect to a VPN.\n\n482\n00:23:51.625 --> 00:23:55.240\nAnd here's Connect to VPN to Work, that\nwas the one that I defined a moment ago.\n\n483\n00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.590\nAnd you can do that and it'll light up and\nit'll actually turn green and\n\n484\n00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.490\nshow a little bit of activity, so\nyou'll know that you're connected.\n\n485\n00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.680\nSo when I go to an untrusted network,\nI just hit that little box,\n\n486\n00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.130\nhit Connect VPN to Work, and off we go.\n\n487\n00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.925\nSo real easy to get connected and\n\n488\n00:24:09.925 --> 00:24:13.063\nnow that untrusted network\nbecomes a trusted network.\n\n489\n00:24:13.063 --> 00:24:16.637\nAnd it's relatively painless if you have\nthe correct settings to provide here and\n\n490\n00:24:16.637 --> 00:24:18.780\nyour network team can get that to you.\n\n491\n00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, well done.\n\n492\n00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:23.815\nExcellent stuff today when it comes to\nmore advanced networking features we found\n\n493\n00:24:23.815 --> 00:24:24.686\nin MacOS Sierra.\n\n494\n00:24:24.686 --> 00:24:26.700\nYou definitely can use the locations.\n\n495\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.358\nThat was an interesting one I was unaware\nof myself, so I might employ that.\n\n496\n00:24:30.358 --> 00:24:31.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then, VPNs,\n\n497\n00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.741\nif you got a business that you\nneed to connect to from outside,\n\n498\n00:24:34.741 --> 00:24:36.209\nmaybe an untrusted network,\n\n499\n00:24:36.209 --> 00:24:39.931\nyou can use that public Internet network\nto make any connection using VPN.\n\n500\n00:24:39.931 --> 00:24:44.380\nYou don't even have to install a third\nparty client, baked right into MacOS.\n\n501\n00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.200\nVery cool stuff today,\n\n502\n00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.660\nDon, anything else you want to add\nto the show before we call it a day?\n\n503\n00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.010\n&gt;&gt; I think that's about it and\n\n504\n00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.490\njust remember, just because we show you a\nfeature, doesn't mean you have to use it.\n\n505\n00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.070\nSo, some of these are not\ngonna be right for you.\n\n506\n00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:58.630\nYou might need that Cisco AnyConnect\nclient because it supports all sorts of\n\n507\n00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.150\ncrazy auto config stuff.\n\n508\n00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.420\nSo maybe you want that, fine, use it.\n\n509\n00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:02.980\nThat's the other thing,\n\n510\n00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:07.100\nyou don't have to use the VPN client\nthat's built into Mac OS by any means.\n\n511\n00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, that being said,\nlooks like we're gonna call it a day for\n\n512\n00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.920\nanother show here at ITProTV.\n\n513\n00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.250\nWe do thank you for watching,\nhopefully you enjoyed it.\n\n514\n00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:17.070\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n515\n00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.838\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n516\n00:25:17.838 --> 00:25:19.987\n&gt;&gt; We'll see

00:00:08.181\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:11.607\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.607 --> 00:00:13.842\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:16.705\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.705 --> 00:00:19.785\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nfor this episode well, that's right,\n\n8\n00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:21.935\nit's more of our ACSP Series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:25.295\nAnd joining us in out studio yet\nagain, our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:26.095\nDon, welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:26.875\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:27.905\n&gt;&gt; It is going swell and\n\n13\n00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:30.415\nthis episode we're going to tackle\na little bit of iCloud action.\n\n14\n00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:32.785\nI know we've talked about iCloud\nin the previous episodes,\n\n15\n00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:35.524\nI wanna run through a few the additional\nfeatures that we can run into,\n\n16\n00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:38.079\nand just kinda highlight some of\nthe things we need to be aware of as\n\n17\n00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.371\nsupport professionals when\nit comes to powering iCloud.\n\n18\n00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:44.187\nNow if you haven't worked with it much,\nwell, let's start with kind of an overview\n\n19\n00:00:44.187 --> 00:00:47.010\nof iCloud and\nthe different features that it provides.\n\n20\n00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.155\nAnd then I'll highlight the ones\nthat I really wanna get at here,\n\n21\n00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:50.458\nto make sure that we know how they work.\n\n22\n00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:53.428\nI definitely wanna tackle\nthe Back to My Mac feature or\n\n23\n00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:56.338\nthe Find My iPhone whatever,\nsorta the same thing.\n\n24\n00:00:56.338 --> 00:01:00.616\nSo taking a look at how that works and\ntalking a little bit about how we might\n\n25\n00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:04.825\nhave to tinker around with the macOS\nfirewall to keep it all functional,\n\n26\n00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:09.310\nbecause it actually is very easy to break\niCloud if you start limiting network\n\n27\n00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.870\naccess.\n\n28\n00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.440\nSo that's kinda what's on our agenda for\nthis show.\n\n29\n00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.280\n&gt;&gt; All right, it's very cool stuff.\n\n30\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.760\nI remember my first introduction to\niCloud was when I got my first iPhone.\n\n31\n00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.340\nAnd they were like,\nyou need to create an iCloud account.\n\n32\n00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.122\nAnd I realized that when I was taking\npictures or something, and I deleted one,\n\n33\n00:01:24.122 --> 00:01:25.317\nthat it was still there.\n\n34\n00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:26.459\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like,\n\n35\n00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.000\nI thought I'd deleted that picture.\n\n36\n00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.290\nWhy is it still there?\n\n37\n00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.710\nAnd it was storing it in iCloud.\n\n38\n00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.870\nAnd I realized so\nthings are going into iCloud.\n\n39\n00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.534\nAnd this was seamless for\n\n40\n00:01:35.534 --> 00:01:38.920\nme, but obviously there were\nsome settings I could play with.\n\n41\n00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.683\nSo when it comes to iCloud,\nwhere should we begin to understand how we\n\n42\n00:01:43.683 --> 00:01:47.389\nwork with it when it comes\nto working inside of macOS?\n\n43\n00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:49.834\n&gt;&gt; All right, the key thing to\nremember it is what you were saying,\n\n44\n00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:51.980\nis that you are technically\nunifying devices, right?\n\n45\n00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.890\nSo the cloud gives us two primary\nfeatures that we really benefit from.\n\n46\n00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.750\nOne, it gives us an offsite backup.\n\n47\n00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.990\nYou have things like your photos that you\ntake these pictures, you can't recreate\n\n48\n00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.760\nthese, and they automatically get\nbacked up to a cloud location.\n\n49\n00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.760\nIf you lose your phone, you lose your\nlaptop, hard drive fails, or whatever,\n\n50\n00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.400\nyou can always go and get your data right\nout of iCloud and you're back in business.\n\n51\n00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.580\nSo that's one thing.\n\n52\n00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.350\nBut the second thing it gives us is\na unified experience across our devices.\n\n53\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.585\nSo if i have an iPhone and an iPad and\na MacBook and an iMac, right?\n\n54\n00:02:23.585 --> 00:02:25.270\nI've got four different devices.\n\n55\n00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.530\nI could take a picture on one and\nI see that picture on all four devices.\n\n56\n00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.010\nI get the same experience\nregardless of which device I go to.\n\n57\n00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.780\nMakes it really easy to\nmove between systems and\n\n58\n00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.180\nstill have full functionality and be able\nto be productive no matter where you are.\n\n59\n00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.650\nIt does require getting it set up.\n\n60\n00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.200\nAnd in the early days, iCloud was\nreally designed around consumers, so\n\n61\n00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.810\nthings like backing up photos.\n\n62\n00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.060\nBut now we've seen it evolve quite a bit,\nso\n\n63\n00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.890\nthat it's got features that really\nbenefit businesses as well.\n\n64\n00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.330\nSo it's something that you should be\ntaking advantage of personally and\n\n65\n00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.340\nat work to really be able to maximize\nhow you're able to use your system.\n\n66\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.270\nNow step one is getting set up\nwith an iCloud account, right?\n\n67\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.160\niCloud accounts are free.\n\n68\n00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.870\nYou can go to icloud.com and create one\nright on Apple's website if you want or\n\n69\n00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.100\nyou can do it through your Mac, right?\n\n70\n00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.860\nWhen I did the initial\ninstall on this Mac,\n\n71\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.430\nit actually asked if I wanted to sign in\nfor my iCloud account or create a new one.\n\n72\n00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.070\nI told them no, I don't wanna.\n\n73\n00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.570\nWell, now I do cuz we need\nto talk about iCloud.\n\n74\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.250\nSo if we take a look at my system here,\nI can go into System Preferences, and\n\n75\n00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.180\nin system preferences you'll find where\niCloud has its own system preference.\n\n76\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.810\nAnd we can jump in there and see whether\nor not we are connected with an apple ID.\n\n77\n00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.340\nNow Apple's ID system can be used with\na number of different things, but\n\n78\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.490\nthe primary thing as iCloud.\n\n79\n00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.380\nIt's pretty much there.\n\n80\n00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.230\nIn the olden days,\nyou had your Apple Developer website, and\n\n81\n00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.750\nyou have these other products that used\nIDs and it was a shared single sign on.\n\n82\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.090\nNow everything is tied into iCloud, and so\n\n83\n00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.970\nit's pretty much an iCloud ID,\nnot an Apple ID.\n\n84\n00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.750\nBut when you sign in,\n\n85\n00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.220\nyou're gonna provide what your ID and\npassword is if you have one.\n\n86\n00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.070\nIf you don't have one,\nyou can create one, right, and it's free.\n\n87\n00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.390\nYou can create it right off the site and\nthen you'll be in business.\n\n88\n00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.668\nSo I'm gonna go and get logged in with\nmine, if I can remember my password.\n\n89\n00:04:09.668 --> 00:04:11.189\nThat's always the hard part.\n\n90\n00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:17.052\nAnd when you get connected, it's gonna be\ngiving you access to a lot of information,\n\n91\n00:04:17.052 --> 00:04:20.720\nright, backups of your files and\nother things.\n\n92\n00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.640\nAnd that's sensitive data.\n\n93\n00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.012\nAnd so it's going to do\ndual factor authentication.\n\n94\n00:04:26.012 --> 00:04:31.330\nIt's gonna require a second step to\nauthenticate that I am who I say I am.\n\n95\n00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.790\nAnd if you have other Apple devices,\nyou can send a message,\n\n96\n00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.720\nyou can send a message to my iPad or\n\n97\n00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.720\nto my iMac and on that device I would be\nable to prove this one as a second factor.\n\n98\n00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.310\nOr you can send a text message to a phone\nnumber that you have on the file.\n\n99\n00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.180\nAnd I think the key secret is\nhere getting your password right.\n\n100\n00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.960\nIt is taking a long time, so\nI'm assuming that I got my password wrong.\n\n101\n00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.270\nSo we'll wait a second while it\nfigures itself out, and if it-\n\n102\n00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.780\n&gt;&gt; Your password is so\n\n103\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.140\neasy to remember, Don is lame.\n\n104\n00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.440\n&gt;&gt; I did get it right.\n\n105\n00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.010\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n106\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.310\n&gt;&gt; So it's offering to send\nme a message to my iPad,\n\n107\n00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.390\nwhich unfortunately is on the other\nside of this building so I can't see it.\n\n108\n00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.450\nOr it can send me a text\nmessage to my phone.\n\n109\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.530\nI'm gonna do that.\n\n110\n00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.320\nI could also do a recovery key.\n\n111\n00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.210\nWhen you set up your iCloud account,\nyou generate a recovery key and\n\n112\n00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.930\nyou store that.\n\n113\n00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.060\nI've got it stored.\n\n114\n00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.530\nI don't want to bring my recovery\nkey up on screen, though, so\n\n115\n00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.680\nI'm not gonna go that route.\n\n116\n00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.970\nI'll let it send me a text message.\n\n117\n00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.550\nAnd so it's gonna send me a text message\nand I will inappropriately check my\n\n118\n00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.350\nphone during the show,\nwhich we don't normally do.\n\n119\n00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.160\nAnd it's giving me a code.\n\n120\n00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.740\nThe code is only good one time so\nI can use it right now and\n\n121\n00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.250\nthen the code is invalidated.\n\n122\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.210\nSo I'm going to punch in my code,\nwhich is 1506, and\n\n123\n00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.980\nthat's gonna make sure\nthat I am who I'm saying.\n\n124\n00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.480\nI knew my password and I had my phone in\nmy possession, right, something I knew and\n\n125\n00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.110\nsomething I had.\n\n126\n00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.596\nThat's the-\n&gt;&gt; Multifactor authentication, man.\n\n127\n00:05:48.596 --> 00:05:50.370\n&gt;&gt; Apple's staying on top of things,\n\n128\n00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.380\nmaking sure they stay\nas secure as possible.\n\n129\n00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.950\n&gt;&gt; And that's really important\nhere because we have so\n\n130\n00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.420\nmuch data that's stored in iCloud.\n\n131\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.640\nAnd once that data's in there,\nwe need to be able to access it, right?\n\n132\n00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.690\nAnd so that's what it's doing right now,\nis it's reaching out to Apple Servers.\n\n133\n00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.474\nIt's talking to them and saying okay,\nwhat do we have set up here,\n\n134\n00:06:05.474 --> 00:06:07.627\nbecause there can be a number\nof different things.\n\n135\n00:06:07.627 --> 00:06:11.110\nAt a minimum,\nyou'll have your iCloud drive, right?\n\n136\n00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.150\nEverybody gets five gigs of storage\nfree as part of your iCloud drive.\n\n137\n00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.760\nAnd you can store things, basic documents,\nvideo games, saved games,\n\n138\n00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.900\nthings like that can go in there.\n\n139\n00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.430\nFive gigs is enough space for that.\n\n140\n00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.620\nIf you're doing backups and things,\nthough, that's not a whole lot of space.\n\n141\n00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.350\nYou might pay to upgrade\nthat to get more storage.\n\n142\n00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.040\nNow it's prompting me about how much I\nwant to use iCloud in this system, right?\n\n143\n00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.550\nDo I wanna use it for mail, contacts,\ncalendars, reminders, notes, and Safari?\n\n144\n00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.480\nOr do I wanna use it for\nFind My Mac, or both, right?\n\n145\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.590\nI'm gonna turn this option off,\nmostly cuz this is a virtual machine and\n\n146\n00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.290\nI don't wanna bring my email\ndown to a virtual machine.\n\n147\n00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.395\nI have a huge mailbox.\n\n148\n00:06:46.395 --> 00:06:47.438\n[LAUGH] So I'm gonna turn that off.\n\n149\n00:06:47.438 --> 00:06:50.320\nWhat would bring down\nthe other things individually?\n\n150\n00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.550\nI could choose these\nindividually on a later screen.\n\n151\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.050\nHere it's doing them all at once.\n\n152\n00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.420\nBut Find My Mac, that's the one\nI really wanna highlight here.\n\n153\n00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.880\nIf you ever lose control of your device,\nif you've lost it, somebody stole it, and\n\n154\n00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.340\nyou wanna try and find it,\nFind My Mac can really help.\n\n155\n00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.770\nFind My Mac actually has two\ndifferent ways of working.\n\n156\n00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.300\nThe primary way is with iPhones and\niPads as a GPS.\n\n157\n00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.790\nAnd so you can use Find My Mac,\nand it will locate the device,\n\n158\n00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.320\nusing its GPS signal to be able to\nfigure out exactly where that device is.\n\n159\n00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.440\nOn a laptop, or a desktop,\nwe don't have a GPS in there, right?\n\n160\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.150\nSo instead, it's gonna use whatever\nwireless network it's connected to, to be\n\n161\n00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.530\nable to try and sort of figure out where\nit is within certain boundaries, right?\n\n162\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.270\nBut if it's not connected\nto a wireless network,\n\n163\n00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.820\nthen you're not gonna be able\nto find it at all, right?\n\n164\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.410\nSo that's kinda the limitation there.\n\n165\n00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.626\n&gt;&gt; So there's a market for\nFaraday cages for thieves, then.\n\n166\n00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:41.136\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n167\n00:07:41.136 --> 00:07:43.724\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Although it's hard to turn around and\n\n168\n00:07:43.724 --> 00:07:44.589\nsell it on eBay.\n\n169\n00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:45.958\nYou gotta keep it in this cage.\n\n170\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.470\n[LAUGH] So the other way that it works\nis what's called Back to My Mac.\n\n171\n00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.930\nAnd with Back to My Mac, if we can\nactually find the Mac on the network,\n\n172\n00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.211\nwe can remotely pull its screen up.\n\n173\n00:07:56.211 --> 00:07:57.814\nAnd we can actually log in to it and\n\n174\n00:07:57.814 --> 00:08:00.520\nuse it as if we were sitting\nright there at that machine.\n\n175\n00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.236\nThat's another really cool way to use it.\n\n176\n00:08:03.236 --> 00:08:06.804\nTurning on Find My Mac does not\nautomatically turn on Back to My Mac,\n\n177\n00:08:06.804 --> 00:08:08.808\nthey're two separate services, but\n\n178\n00:08:08.808 --> 00:08:12.670\nthey're really related in the way\nthat we connect to the machine.\n\n179\n00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.700\nYour machine, as soon as you turn it on,\nis phoning home to Apple every so\n\n180\n00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.780\noften telling Apple where it is.\n\n181\n00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.350\nAnd then you can go to another Mac and\nconnect back to your original one,\n\n182\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.190\ngoing through Apple.\n\n183\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.920\nYou're kind of proxying through\napple to find your device that's\n\n184\n00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.750\nout there on the network.\n\n185\n00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:33.510\nSo those two services are pretty inter\nconnected, now as I move forward on this,\n\n186\n00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.440\nit's gonna say do I wanna allow Find\nMy Mac to use the location of the Mac.\n\n187\n00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.990\nIf you say no, you might as well\nnot even turn the thing on, so\n\n188\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.080\nyou usually want to allow that so\nit can actually find it.\n\n189\n00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.733\nAnd now I get the screen where I can\ngo through and individually turn on and\n\n190\n00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:50.647\noff the features that I want.\n\n191\n00:08:50.647 --> 00:08:54.535\nSo let's just run down this list really\nquick, we've got the iCloud drive, right,\n\n192\n00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:56.698\nI can actually see down\nhere my iCloud storage.\n\n193\n00:08:56.698 --> 00:08:59.826\nSays that I have five gigs of\niCloud storage right now and\n\n194\n00:08:59.826 --> 00:09:01.640\nI got 4.96 gigs available.\n\n195\n00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.850\nSo I'm not using much of it, but\nthat's my storage in the cloud, if I turn\n\n196\n00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:11.760\non iCloud Drive here, it's gonna start\ncopying and synchronizing that data local.\n\n197\n00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.680\nSo now I've got a local copy, not just\nthe copy that's up there in the cloud.\n\n198\n00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.900\nAnd that means I can work with it and\nedit the files locally nice and fast and\n\n199\n00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.220\nthey synchronize up to\nthe cloud afterwards.\n\n200\n00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.340\nIf I go into the options on that,\n\n201\n00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.670\nyou'll see this not a whole heck\nof a lot that we can tweak here.\n\n202\n00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.900\nWe choose what we want to synchronize,\nthings that are on our Desktop, TextEdit,\n\n203\n00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.520\nWeather, other items you can add in\nhere as you install applications\n\n204\n00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.210\nthey'll get added to this list.\n\n205\n00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.565\nThis computer, it doesn't have a whole\nheck of a lot on it, it's a brand\n\n206\n00:09:39.565 --> 00:09:43.362\nnew install, but if I had Microsoft Office\nand other things we could turn that on.\n\n207\n00:09:43.362 --> 00:09:46.792\nNormally you'll say I wanna turn on\nthe Desktops &amp; Documents folder,\n\n208\n00:09:46.792 --> 00:09:49.261\nso now I'm synchronizing\nthose up into the cloud.\n\n209\n00:09:51.474 --> 00:09:55.640\nAll right, we've got photos, if we take\nphotos, and we wanna synchronize those up.\n\n210\n00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.830\nYou can create a library and\nit'll be synchronized to iCloud,\n\n211\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.800\nit's really hand if you\nhave mobile devices.\n\n212\n00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.030\nI don't have one for the lab so\nI'll just leave that turn off, your email,\n\n213\n00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.790\nthat's a nice one because\nyou don't have to go and\n\n214\n00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.250\nset up your email account over and\nover again on multiple Macs.\n\n215\n00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.100\nNow, it can actually just bring it down,\nyou fire up Mac Mail and there it is, now,\n\n216\n00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.520\nit is using Mac Mail.\n\n217\n00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.310\nSo if you're using something\nlike Thunderbird or\n\n218\n00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.830\nMicrosoft Outlook, that's not this,\nthis is just Mac Mail.\n\n219\n00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.900\nContacts and Calendars are for\nthe native contacts and\n\n220\n00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.670\ncalendars apps inside of Mac OS.\n\n221\n00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.940\nIf we turn those on and\nit'll start to synchronize them to and\n\n222\n00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.742\nagain they'll automatically be configured.\n\n223\n00:10:26.742 --> 00:10:30.620\nReminders and notes are the same way,\nSafari is the one that's a little\n\n224\n00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.570\nbit different because, with Safari, what\nit's synchronizing are your favorites.\n\n225\n00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.524\nRight, as you bookmark pages and\nyou store them in the favorites list,\n\n226\n00:10:37.524 --> 00:10:39.060\nthey get synchronized up in iCloud.\n\n227\n00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.950\nAnd that's pretty cool, because if\nyou have a iPhone and an iPad and\n\n228\n00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.280\nan iMac, you have the same\nbookmarks on all of them.\n\n229\n00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.570\nSo your web browsing experience is\nvery similar, now, when I turn it on,\n\n230\n00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:53.130\nit says do I want to merge my bookmarks\nand reading list with iCloud.\n\n231\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.050\nI've already got some bookmarks on\nthis computer, if I choose okay,\n\n232\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.290\nit's gonna merge the bookmarks on this\ncomputer with what's already in the cloud,\n\n233\n00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.860\nand now I get one big set.\n\n234\n00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.780\nIf I choose Cancel, it's gonna get rid\nof the bookmarks on this computer, and\n\n235\n00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.062\ndownload the ones from the cloud.\n\n236\n00:11:08.062 --> 00:11:10.076\nIf this is a brand of computer\nthat's probably what I want,\n\n237\n00:11:10.076 --> 00:11:11.583\nI don't care about what's on this system.\n\n238\n00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:15.900\nBut if I have existing bookmarks I\nwant to merge and so I can say, OK and\n\n239\n00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.460\nit'll upload mine and then download\nthe others to merge them together.\n\n240\n00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.649\nAll right, Keychain is another service,\nwith Keychain,\n\n241\n00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:26.020\nwe're synchronizing our passwords.\n\n242\n00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.250\nNow, don't freak out cuz\npeople immediately think,\n\n243\n00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.510\nwhy would I send my\npasswords into the cloud?\n\n244\n00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.030\nWhat happens is on every Mac and\niPhone and iPad for\n\n245\n00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.390\nthat matter you have a service\ncalled the Keychain.\n\n246\n00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.878\nIf you fire up your finder the utility for\nit is Keychain access,\n\n247\n00:11:39.878 --> 00:11:42.010\nI'm pretty sure I talked\nabout it in another episode.\n\n248\n00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.752\nBut every time you log into a web page or\n\n249\n00:11:44.752 --> 00:11:50.251\nyou log into a service it stores the\ncredential here inside of the Keychain.\n\n250\n00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:54.777\nAnd the Keychain is an encrypted database\nthat's encrypted using your account\n\n251\n00:11:54.777 --> 00:11:57.620\npassword, so\nwhen you create a login account.\n\n252\n00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.519\nThat's right, we talked about this\nin that episode we talked about\n\n253\n00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:00.198\nresetting passwords.\n\n254\n00:12:00.198 --> 00:12:03.364\nSo, if you reset a password,\nit kinda screws up the Keychain, right.\n\n255\n00:12:03.364 --> 00:12:07.591\nSo we've seen that in the password\nepisodes, but it is encrypted using your\n\n256\n00:12:07.591 --> 00:12:11.630\npassword, so when we choose to\nsynchronize up into iCloud.\n\n257\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.850\nWell, now I have a problem, because I\nmight have one password on my MacBook, and\n\n258\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.590\nanother password on my iMac, and\nno password at all on my iPhone,\n\n259\n00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.660\nI might have a pin number, right.\n\n260\n00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.830\nSo if they all have\ndifferent authentication,\n\n261\n00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.540\nhow do they unlock the Keychain?\n\n262\n00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.700\nWell, by storing it in the Keychain,\n\n263\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:33.310\nit ties it all to the iCloud credential\ninstead of your local account credential.\n\n264\n00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.880\nSo by doing that it now has one encryption\n\n265\n00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.030\nkey that's able to be shared across these\ndevices so they're able to get at it.\n\n266\n00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:43.551\nSo when I turn that on it's asking me to\nprovide my Apple ID password cuz it's\n\n267\n00:12:43.551 --> 00:12:47.500\ngotta re-encrypt the Keychain\nusing the new password.\n\n268\n00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.020\nAnd so I'll punch that in, so\n\n269\n00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.945\nthat it can re-encrypt in a key that will\nbe known by each of the different devices.\n\n270\n00:12:53.945 --> 00:12:59.280\n[COUGH] All right, you may not want that,\nyou can turn it off, you'll survive.\n\n271\n00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.280\nNow when I turn it on, it's saying that\nI've already got a Keychain in iCloud.\n\n272\n00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.510\nI've already got stuff up\nthere to synchronize, and\n\n273\n00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.450\nso, this is going to be connecting\nto an existing Keychain.\n\n274\n00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.070\nIf it was brand new,\nit wouldn't ask me this, but\n\n275\n00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.550\nsince it's already existing,\nI need to request approval.\n\n276\n00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.630\nAnd there's two ways to do it,\nright, I can do a security code,\n\n277\n00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:21.140\nwhich is like a recovery key, or I can\nrequest approval from one of my devices.\n\n278\n00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.770\nAnd when you hit request approval,\n\n279\n00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.660\nit's only gonna list other devices\nyou've synchronized your Keychain with,\n\n280\n00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.740\nright, and it's gonna send that\nout to those other devices.\n\n281\n00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.195\nAnd if I have my iPad right here,\nwhich unfortunately I don't,\n\n282\n00:13:32.195 --> 00:13:35.105\nthere'd be a message popped up on it\nright now saying this device is trying to\n\n283\n00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:37.620\nconnect to your Keychain\ndo you wanna allow it?\n\n284\n00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.580\nAnd I can choose to allow or\n\n285\n00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.346\nnot because my iPad is already\nconnected to the Keychain.\n\n286\n00:13:41.346 --> 00:13:43.840\nIt can act as that other\ndevice to approve it,\n\n287\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.190\nnow I don't have to keep this screen\nup I can just hit OK and move on.\n\n288\n00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.280\nAnd it says waiting for approval, and\nI can just run into my office and\n\n289\n00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.840\nhit OK, it'll pop up, and\nthen it'll synchronize, right.\n\n290\n00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.800\nSo that's another thing that we can do,\ndown the road, then the last\n\n291\n00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.300\ntwo are the ones that I really wanted to\nget to, Back to My Mac and Find My Mac.\n\n292\n00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.760\nFind My Mac is already turned on,\nright, I turned it on and\n\n293\n00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.420\nit says the Mac can't be located,\nall right.\n\n294\n00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.439\n&gt;&gt; You're like, it's right in front of me,\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n295\n00:14:08.439 --> 00:14:12.096\n&gt;&gt; Why can't it be located, yeah, it can't\nlocated cuz it doesn't have a GPS, and\n\n296\n00:14:12.096 --> 00:14:14.428\nit's not connected to a wireless network,\nright.\n\n297\n00:14:14.428 --> 00:14:18.880\nI've got it physically wired right now,\nso there's no wireless connection on it.\n\n298\n00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.230\nSo if it doesn't have\nan SSID to locate off of,\n\n299\n00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.240\nthen it can't really narrow it down.\n\n300\n00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.500\nAll it has is an IP address, and\nthe IP address is a private IP anyway,\n\n301\n00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.270\nso it really has no idea where it is.\n\n302\n00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:33.700\nMaybe it could figure out its public\nIP and geolocate that, but that, you're\n\n303\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.150\nusually lucky if it gets the country\nright, better yet within 40 meters.\n\n304\n00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:42.780\nWe're talking about thousands of miles\nof ground that it could be covering, so,\n\n305\n00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.550\nit's not able to find it.\n\n306\n00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.900\nIt's really only useful\nwhen you have wireless,\n\n307\n00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.830\nand especially when you have cellular,\nright, like in an iPad or an iPhone.\n\n308\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.433\nIf I go into the details, though,\nI can see additional information,\n\n309\n00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:55.318\nand it's telling me this Mac can't be\nlocated because it does not have WiFi.\n\n310\n00:14:55.318 --> 00:14:58.728\nIf I switched it to WiFi,\nthen it would happen, all right, so for\n\n311\n00:14:58.728 --> 00:15:03.006\nexample let me go to my laptop, here's\nmy laptop, which does have WiFi, right,\n\n312\n00:15:03.006 --> 00:15:06.311\nI'm connected to the ITProTV\nwireless network here, right.\n\n313\n00:15:06.311 --> 00:15:10.174\nSo if I go into my system preferences and\n\n314\n00:15:10.174 --> 00:15:16.020\nI go into my iCloud, which is,\nwhoops, there we go.\n\n315\n00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.260\nAnd I go into my iCloud,\nI can come in here and\n\n316\n00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.605\nI can pull up my Find My Mac\nwhich is conveniently turned off.\n\n317\n00:15:21.605 --> 00:15:23.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't recall turning it off.\n\n318\n00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.960\n&gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that you-\n&gt;&gt; Apparently I turned that one off,\n\n319\n00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.350\nall right, so if I go and\nturn that one on.\n\n320\n00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.740\nI know I'll have to allow it,\nthere we go, all right, [COUGH] and\n\n321\n00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.200\nnow it's setting up, and now it's turned\non and I don't have the warning, right.\n\n322\n00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.160\nNo warning because well, it has WiFi.\n\n323\n00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.758\n&gt;&gt; You can find it.\n\n324\n00:15:37.758 --> 00:15:38.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n325\n00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.500\nwhat's going on is companies like Google,\nthey send that little street view car\n\n326\n00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.190\naround and stuff,-\n&gt;&gt; I saw it yesterday.\n\n327\n00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.610\n&gt;&gt; You see them surprisingly often, and\n\n328\n00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.948\nwhat they're doing is they're recording\nany wireless network they encounter.\n\n329\n00:15:50.948 --> 00:15:53.976\n&gt;&gt; And so they'll encounter like the\nITProTV wireless network and they'll say,\n\n330\n00:15:53.976 --> 00:15:55.343\nyeah, it's located in this area.\n\n331\n00:15:55.343 --> 00:15:57.806\nAnd so Apple's able to\nreference against that stuff,\n\n332\n00:15:57.806 --> 00:16:00.535\nto say, this laptop thinks it's\non the ITProTV wireless and\n\n333\n00:16:00.535 --> 00:16:03.230\nwe know that wireless is Over\nin this particular location.\n\n334\n00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:07.062\nNow, you might have more than one\nwireless network with the same name.\n\n335\n00:16:07.062 --> 00:16:09.836\nAnd there's ways they locate based on\nthat also there's additional information\n\n336\n00:16:09.836 --> 00:16:10.484\nthey can pull out.\n\n337\n00:16:10.484 --> 00:16:13.250\nLike a MAC address of\nthe access points and things.\n\n338\n00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.470\nThey catalog a lot of that.\n\n339\n00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.760\nSo that's how it works.\n\n340\n00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.172\nBut mine is not complaining\nbecause it does have wireless.\n\n341\n00:16:19.172 --> 00:16:25.638\nAnd actually, while I'm in here on\nmy laptop, I can see my Keychain.\n\n342\n00:16:25.638 --> 00:16:28.953\nLab-Client01 is requesting approval.\n\n343\n00:16:28.953 --> 00:16:32.139\nThat's that little message telling\nme there's somebody else out there\n\n344\n00:16:32.139 --> 00:16:34.060\nthat's waiting to get approved.\n\n345\n00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.390\nAnd, if I go in here,\nI can see the details of that.\n\n346\n00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.840\nAnd if I go into the details,\nI can come in and\n\n347\n00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.520\nI can approve that client\nto allow it to connect.\n\n348\n00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.110\nAnd so I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo that and we'll allow that.\n\n349\n00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:51.010\nAnd so it's going to reach out and approve\nand allow it and let that person connect.\n\n350\n00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.650\nAnd now they'll be connected to my iCloud.\n\n351\n00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.140\n&gt;&gt; So, Don, now that you've approved that,\nis that the final step?\n\n352\n00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.660\nAll you had to do was do that and now\nthe two Keychains should be linked up and\n\n353\n00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.670\nyou're ready to rock?\n\n354\n00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the final step,\nbut it's not.\n\n355\n00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.200\nIt's not instantaneous.\n\n356\n00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.170\nSo if I jump back to my other machine\nhere, see how it still says waiting for\n\n357\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.380\napproval from other device.\n\n358\n00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.180\nIt takes a little time because the two\ndevices don't talk to each other,\n\n359\n00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.340\nthey talk to Apple.\n\n360\n00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:17.250\nSo my laptop went and\ntalked to Apple, now I gotta wait for\n\n361\n00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.040\nthis lab machine to talk to Apple and\nfind out that it's been approved.\n\n362\n00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:20.880\nAnd eventually it'll update.\n\n363\n00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.951\n&gt;&gt; So it's red tape bureaucracy.\n\n364\n00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:23.239\n[LAUGH] A little bit of that.\n\n365\n00:17:23.239 --> 00:17:26.277\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it takes a little bit of time,\nbut it'll clear itself up soon enough.\n\n366\n00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.719\nNow the next two options I've got\nare the Back to My Mac and Find My Mac.\n\n367\n00:17:29.719 --> 00:17:32.490\nWe've been kinda running through here.\n\n368\n00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:38.130\nWhen I look at my Find My Mac, well this\none can't be located while my laptop can.\n\n369\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:44.170\nSo my laptop is now enabled for finding,\nwell for being found if I lose it.\n\n370\n00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:45.500\nSo how do I actually go and find it?\n\n371\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:51.020\nWell, we log in to iCloud, so you go to\nicloud.com and you log into the webpage.\n\n372\n00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.170\nYou log in with your Apple ID.\n\n373\n00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.730\nAnd when you log in,\nyou'll see your various services,\n\n374\n00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.820\nlike your iCloud drive and\nthings you can access via the webpage.\n\n375\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.040\nAnd you'll see Find iPhone.\n\n376\n00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.630\nAnd I know,\nwe're trying to find a Mac, right?\n\n377\n00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:03.560\nBut it's the same system.\n\n378\n00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.220\nWhen you go to find the device,\nyou can choose to find it.\n\n379\n00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.700\nAnd it's gonna give us the option\nto be able to locate that device.\n\n380\n00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.980\nNow, well, it's gonna make me sign\nin again to get through here.\n\n381\n00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.630\nThey definitely err on the side of caution\nwith a lot of this stuff because this\n\n382\n00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:18.310\nis sensitive data.\n\n383\n00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.090\nYou know, you don't want somebody\nbeing able to track you and\n\n384\n00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.490\nfigure out where you are and all that.\n\n385\n00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.460\nSo they've gotta be kinda\nsafe with this stuff.\n\n386\n00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.350\nBut basically it's gonna reach out and\nlet me find my device.\n\n387\n00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.940\nAnd by default this is gonna try and\nfind all of my devices.\n\n388\n00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.800\nMy iPad, my iPhone,\nmy well my lab machine, now my laptop,\n\n389\n00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.200\nis gonna try and find all that.\n\n390\n00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.660\nBut up top you've got\na little drop down box, and\n\n391\n00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.360\nyou see how right now it says all devices?\n\n392\n00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.052\nWell I can click that and drop it down,\nand I'll get a list of the devices.\n\n393\n00:18:48.052 --> 00:18:51.574\nAnd the very first one here for\nme is my MacBook Pro.\n\n394\n00:18:51.574 --> 00:18:53.864\nAnd it's gonna zoom in, and\n\n395\n00:18:53.864 --> 00:18:58.650\nas I continue to zoom in it\nshows that I'm at office coffee.\n\n396\n00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.770\nWell, actually that's coffee shop right in\nthe lobby of our building right out there.\n\n397\n00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.120\nSo it's got me you know right here and\n\n398\n00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.106\nhe knows that I'm here in this location\nright by Dr. Susie whoever that is.\n\n399\n00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:10.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I actially have no idea.\n\n400\n00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.670\nBut I checked in less than a minute ago.\n\n401\n00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.120\nNotice how my lab machine doesn't show up.\n\n402\n00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.317\nWell, actually I guess I filtered it but\n\n403\n00:19:15.317 --> 00:19:17.091\nif I hadn't filtered it the lab\nmachine wouldn't show up.\n\n404\n00:19:17.091 --> 00:19:20.220\nBecause it cant find it, it doesn't have\nwireless it doesn't know where it is.\n\n405\n00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.910\nBut now I'm able to find that device.\n\n406\n00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.700\nAnd I found it by using the website.\n\n407\n00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.440\nAnd now that I've found it over\nhere you'll see where I can make it\n\n408\n00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.600\nplay a sound.\n\n409\n00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.260\nIt's like a, I think I lost it but\nit shows it as being in my house.\n\n410\n00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.530\nLet me get it to play a sound so\nI can hear it.\n\n411\n00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.460\nRight?\nIt'll make a tone and you can find it.\n\n412\n00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.870\nI can lock it to stop somebody\nelse from being able to get in it,\n\n413\n00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.990\nand I can erase it.\n\n414\n00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.160\nReally handy if you've got\nsensitive data on there and\n\n415\n00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.170\nyou've lost control of the device.\n\n416\n00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.920\nIf you can find it this way,\n\n417\n00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.110\nyou might only have a brief window\nof time where you have access to it.\n\n418\n00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.240\nErase it.\n\n419\n00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.450\nAnd hopefully you got a Time Machine\nbackup somewhere, you got all your data.\n\n420\n00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.150\nYou erase the device, and now at least\nyou know your data didn't get leaked.\n\n421\n00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.210\nAnd it'll do a secure wipe on the device.\n\n422\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.870\n&gt;&gt; Government agencies could\nprobably benefit from that.\n\n423\n00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] laptops like it's going out\n\n424\n00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.060\nof style.\n\n425\n00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.320\n&gt;&gt; It is unfortunate\nhow much that happens.\n\n426\n00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.720\nBut, yes, that's basically find my Mac.\n\n427\n00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.000\nNow, what it's not giving me the option\nto do is remotely connect to that Mac and\n\n428\n00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.250\nsee the screen.\n\n429\n00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.020\nThat's what the back of my\nMac featured us right and\n\n430\n00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.980\nthat's his other option that we\nsee right here back to my Mac.\n\n431\n00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.560\nI'm going to turn that on for\nmy lab machine.\n\n432\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.330\nAnd when I turn it on,\nsee how I get a warning?\n\n433\n00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.012\nTurn on sharing to access this Mac.\n\n434\n00:20:26.012 --> 00:20:27.989\nAll right well, that's what it's doing.\n\n435\n00:20:27.989 --> 00:20:32.069\nIf I go on to my details, it's saying here\nthat I might not be able to use it because\n\n436\n00:20:32.069 --> 00:20:34.410\nfile sharing or\nscreen sharing is turned off.\n\n437\n00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.350\nBack to my Mac,\ncommunicates through Apple servers.\n\n438\n00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.430\nSo you're able to find it\nanywhere in the world.\n\n439\n00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:43.160\nBut when you finally go to connect, you're\nactually connecting to the device itself.\n\n440\n00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.640\nAnd it needs to have screen\nsharing turned on for that.\n\n441\n00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.420\nSo that's what it's warning me here is\nthat I need to turn on file sharing and\n\n442\n00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.870\nscreen sharing.\n\n443\n00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:54.908\nNow, if I Cancel and\njust go back out to my system preferences.\n\n444\n00:20:54.908 --> 00:20:56.354\nYou can go into sharing, and\n\n445\n00:20:56.354 --> 00:20:59.679\nthere's a number of different\nsharing preferences right here.\n\n446\n00:20:59.679 --> 00:21:01.900\nAnd the reason I went this\nway is it wouldn't click it.\n\n447\n00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.257\nIf I do it the other way it\nautomatically clicks what you need.\n\n448\n00:21:04.257 --> 00:21:05.390\nSo I need to show you.\n\n449\n00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.346\nWe need to turn on file sharing, so\nI'm just going to turn that one on.\n\n450\n00:21:08.346 --> 00:21:12.883\nAnd if you look at screen sharing,\nyou can turn that one on, and\n\n451\n00:21:12.883 --> 00:21:15.290\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n452\n00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:18.120\nYou'll see where it's approved for\nadministrators of the device only, and\n\n453\n00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.490\nyou can choose for other people.\n\n454\n00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.140\nBut once it's turned on,\n\n455\n00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.840\nthose are the two pieces that make\nthe Back to My Mac feature function.\n\n456\n00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Now Don,\nif we can just turn this on manually,\n\n457\n00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.900\nwhat do we need with\nthe Back to My Mac feature?\n\n458\n00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.325\n&gt;&gt; Well, so\nif you look here at the address.\n\n459\n00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:35.490\nvnc://, VNC is Virtual Network Computing.\n\n460\n00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.440\nThat's the protocol that we use\nto see the screen and the IP,\n\n461\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.480\nthat's a private address.\n\n462\n00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.610\nThat's my address on\nthe local network here.\n\n463\n00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.250\nWell, if I'm out at\nthe hotel in California,\n\n464\n00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.590\nI'm not gonna be able to\nconnect to this private IP.\n\n465\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:53.040\nSo I need to be able to bounce through\nInternet servers to get to this client.\n\n466\n00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.270\nAnd that's what Back to my Mac\nis really bringing to the table.\n\n467\n00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.070\nIt's making it where I can\nget to it via the Internet.\n\n468\n00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:04.200\nSo now, if I go back to iCloud and\nlook at my settings.\n\n469\n00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.160\nI can see that back to my Mac,\nit says, iCloud server not responding.\n\n470\n00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.900\nOkay, that's not me, that's Apple.\n\n471\n00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.830\nSo it's trying to talk to Apple,\nthe iCloud server that's not responding.\n\n472\n00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:15.480\nIf I go into details, I can just\nmake sure that everything is clear.\n\n473\n00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.070\nIt's just telling me here, try turning\nit off and turning it back on again.\n\n474\n00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.010\nThat's always sound advice.\n\n475\n00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:21.980\nSo we'll give that a shot.\n\n476\n00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.780\nI guess maybe our network connectivity\nwasn't where it needed to be.\n\n477\n00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.590\nSo let's try that again.\n\n478\n00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.000\nAnd it's gonna reach out and\nthis time no errors.\n\n479\n00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.590\nNo errors, it connected up and\nin theory Back to My Mac is working.\n\n480\n00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.410\nHow do I use Back to My Mac?\n\n481\n00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:41.710\nWell, you might have noticed back\nwhen I was in my iCloud screen,\n\n482\n00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.500\nthat there's no Back\nto my Mac option here.\n\n483\n00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.490\nAnd even when I was in\nthe find iPhone screen and\n\n484\n00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.340\nI had found my Mac Book pro and\nI had these buttons.\n\n485\n00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.640\nThere's no option to actually\nview the screen of the device.\n\n486\n00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.860\nThis, the iCloud web page,\nyou can use from anything.\n\n487\n00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.800\nFrom an iPad, from a Windows machine,\nfrom a Linux machine,\n\n488\n00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.740\nanything with a web browser.\n\n489\n00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.050\nYou can log in and\nyou can use this functionality.\n\n490\n00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.500\nBut Back to my Mac,\nonly works from another Mac.\n\n491\n00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.870\nI have to have a second Mac.\n\n492\n00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.091\nSo if I have a iMac in my office and\nthis MacBook Pro, and\n\n493\n00:23:15.091 --> 00:23:19.587\nI've got Back to My Mac turned on, I\ncould go to one and connect to the other.\n\n494\n00:23:19.587 --> 00:23:23.585\nAnd I actually do that quite a bit so I\nmight be travelling with this laptop, and\n\n495\n00:23:23.585 --> 00:23:25.779\nthen I connect back to\nmy iMac in my office.\n\n496\n00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:28.360\nCuz I have documents and\nthings that I wanna work with.\n\n497\n00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.630\nSo the way you work with it is you\nactually do it through Finder.\n\n498\n00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:32.890\nIt's kind of counterintuitive.\n\n499\n00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.999\nI wanna do something on the Internet so\nI'm gonna go to Finder, you know,\n\n500\n00:23:35.999 --> 00:23:38.070\nwhere I go to browse local files.\n\n501\n00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.750\nThat isn't necessarily intuitive but\n\n502\n00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:44.820\nin the finder, you can actually\nadd your Back to my Mac devices.\n\n503\n00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.640\nNow they are hidden by default.\n\n504\n00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.910\nSo what you need to do is go up into\nyour Finder Menu and preferences.\n\n505\n00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:55.991\nAnd here's where you can choose\nwhat shows up in your side bar.\n\n506\n00:23:55.991 --> 00:24:00.284\nAnd in your side bar, you'll see\na list of stuff that can show up and\n\n507\n00:24:00.284 --> 00:24:03.130\nyou'll find under Shared\nis Back to My Mac.\n\n508\n00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.453\nAnd if you've got that turned on,\nwhich I'm pretty it's off by default,\n\n509\n00:24:06.453 --> 00:24:07.681\nI've turned it on on mine.\n\n510\n00:24:07.681 --> 00:24:10.924\nOnce you've got that turned on,\ninside of the Finder,\n\n511\n00:24:10.924 --> 00:24:15.271\nif you go to the Shared section,\nright here, you'll see shared devices,\n\n512\n00:24:15.271 --> 00:24:17.970\nincluding devices with Back to My Mac.\n\n513\n00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:18.650\nAnd it's kinda neat,\n\n514\n00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.930\nbecause I'm seeing a bunch of computers\nthat are here on the network, right?\n\n515\n00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:26.230\nAnd what you'll find is where these\ndevices that are out there on the Internet\n\n516\n00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.310\nwill show up.\n\n517\n00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.720\nAnd you can click on them and\n\n518\n00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:35.100\nyou'll actually have the option to connect\nto it and view its screen and see it.\n\n519\n00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.470\nAnd the way it works,\n\n520\n00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.950\nI'm waiting my lab machine has not\nshown up here for some reason.\n\n521\n00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.360\nWe're probably gonna run through\nmy patience on this one too.\n\n522\n00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.690\nI'll pick another machine.\n\n523\n00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:46.540\nThen when you go here and\n\n524\n00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.830\nyou take a look at it,\nis you'll see a Share Screen button.\n\n525\n00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.020\nShare screen is how you\nknow that it works.\n\n526\n00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.460\nSo I could be on a completely different\nnetwork, and I go to the shared menu, and\n\n527\n00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.200\nI won't see any of my work computers\nbecause they're not there, but\n\n528\n00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.860\nI'll see the ones that\nare Back to My Mac turned on.\n\n529\n00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.700\nAnd you double click on it and\nyou hit Share Screen and\n\n530\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.810\nit's gonna connect you to that device.\n\n531\n00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:11.550\nNow the device that I've picked here is\nnot logged in to my iCloud account so\n\n532\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.010\nI can't authenticate on it.\n\n533\n00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:17.330\nEventually, my little lab machine will\nshow up and I'll be able to connect to it.\n\n534\n00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:20.440\nBut it looks like it's\njust not showing up yet.\n\n535\n00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.660\nLet me see if it's still\ngetting that error.\n\n536\n00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.825\nRemember it had the error, yeah it is,\niCloud server not responding.\n\n537\n00:25:24.825 --> 00:25:27.372\nSo, if it's not able to get\nout to the iCloud server,\n\n538\n00:25:27.372 --> 00:25:29.330\nthat's gonna stop me from connecting.\n\n539\n00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.600\nNow, why can't I connect?\n\n540\n00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.980\nWhat's the problem here?\n\n541\n00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.210\nWell, there could be a few things.\n\n542\n00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:34.420\nIt could actually be network connectivity,\n\n543\n00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.730\nit could be a problem in Apple's end,\nit could be me causing the problem too.\n\n544\n00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:42.860\nOne of the key things I see that\nbreaks this is the MacOS Firewall.\n\n545\n00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.760\nInside a Mac OS you got a firewall.\n\n546\n00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.020\nAnd the firewall's turned off by default.\n\n547\n00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:53.110\nIf you go into system preferences,\nsecurity and privacy and go into firewall.\n\n548\n00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.560\nHere's the firewall, and\nyou see mine's turned off.\n\n549\n00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.940\nSo odds are it's not causing my problem.\n\n550\n00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:02.800\nBut if you've turned on this firewall,\nthe default configuration says that\n\n551\n00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.930\nit will block all incoming connections,\nwhich includes Back to My Mac.\n\n552\n00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:12.820\nSo if you've turned on this firewall, you\nneed to go into the firewall options, and\n\n553\n00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.520\nyou need to make sure that\nyou've added this Screen Sharing\n\n554\n00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.290\nto allow it to come in, right?\n\n555\n00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.670\nThat screen sharing is pretty important.\n\n556\n00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.460\nIf that's been blocked,\nBack to My Mac is not gonna work.\n\n557\n00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.380\nAnd I'll put in the show notes the list\nof actual network ports that are used\n\n558\n00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.020\nbecause it might not be this\nfirewall that's the problem.\n\n559\n00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.857\nIt might be the firewall on your network,\nright?\n\n560\n00:26:31.857 --> 00:26:34.463\nSo while this firewall is\nturned off in my lab machine,\n\n561\n00:26:34.463 --> 00:26:38.556\nthere's a firewall in these racks behind\nme that actually is filtering our network.\n\n562\n00:26:38.556 --> 00:26:43.900\nAnd one of them might be blocking Back to\nMy Mac from working and getting connected.\n\n563\n00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.580\nOkay, so that can always be\npart of the problem, as well.\n\n564\n00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:51.200\nSo, we've gotta be aware of that and once\nit's up and going, we can then connect\n\n565\n00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.360\nright over to the other system and\nyou're back in business, all right?\n\n566\n00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.928\nSo it typically ends up being a network\nissue and something like that.\n\n567\n00:26:56.928 --> 00:27:00.910\nAll right, well, let's see here\n\n568\n00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:04.490\non my own laptop when I went into\nmy system preferences and iCloud.\n\n569\n00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.380\nLet me see if I'm getting\nthe same error here.\n\n570\n00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:12.820\nThis is another way to troubleshoot it,\nis that under Back to My Mac I can see\n\n571\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.180\non my laptop, it's telling me I need to\nset up the router for better performance.\n\n572\n00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.740\nBut that means that it\nactually should be working.\n\n573\n00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.180\nIt's not telling me it\ncan't get to the server,\n\n574\n00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.220\nit's just saying it could\nwork a little faster.\n\n575\n00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.910\nAnd if I go into the details, it'll tell\nme about it, about using universal plug\n\n576\n00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:30.910\nand play or NET-PnP to update the router,\nbut it should be working.\n\n577\n00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:36.550\nLet me try this the other direction,\nwe'll go from my new shiny Mac,\n\n578\n00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.160\nto connect over to my own laptop,\n\n579\n00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.591\nwhich should create a screen recursion\nthat'll be pretty impressive [LAUGH].\n\n580\n00:27:41.591 --> 00:27:46.149\nSo when I go in here and\nI go into my sharing, inside my sharing,\n\n581\n00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:48.620\nI see Don's MacBook Pro.\n\n582\n00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:52.130\nAnd even if I were remote,\nif I were in another country,\n\n583\n00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:56.830\nI would see that Don's MacBook Pro,\nbecause it's via my iCloud account.\n\n584\n00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:02.760\nAnd if I choose share screen, now it\nshouldn't harass me about authentication,\n\n585\n00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.320\nbecause I'm logged in\nwith my iCloud account.\n\n586\n00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.480\nSee how it says,\nconnecting to Don's MacBook Pro.\n\n587\n00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.580\nSo it's reaching out over the Internet and\n\n588\n00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.340\ntrying to connect back to my\nMacBook Pro to show that screen.\n\n589\n00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.290\nNow, technically I'm about to connect\nto myself, and so that's going to-\n\n590\n00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.473\n&gt;&gt; It's going to be an interesting day.\n\n591\n00:28:19.473 --> 00:28:21.953\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's actually\ngonna disconnect me, but\n\n592\n00:28:21.953 --> 00:28:24.077\nwe'll give it a shot and\nsee what happens here.\n\n593\n00:28:24.077 --> 00:28:29.044\nSo let me go ahead and connect,\nand you know what shoot,\n\n594\n00:28:29.044 --> 00:28:32.170\nI put in my iCloud credentials.\n\n595\n00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.600\nIt's actually not asking my iCloud\ncredentials, it's asking for\n\n596\n00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.710\nthe username and password I used\nto log in into the machine.\n\n597\n00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.980\nAnd they don't have to match, you have the\noption to make the match when you set up\n\n598\n00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.670\na new machine, but in my case I didn't.\n\n599\n00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.460\nI actually have a different\nusername on the Mac itself, and so\n\n600\n00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.920\nI've just put in the wrong thing.\n\n601\n00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.950\nSo it's gonna fail.\n\n602\n00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:50.890\nBut basically once it connects you see\nthe screen of the device as if you're\n\n603\n00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.240\nsitting right there and\nyou're able to work with it.\n\n604\n00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:58.420\nWhich is actually pretty neat at the end\nof the day because it really helps for\n\n605\n00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.440\nremotely accessing and\nusing those devices.\n\n606\n00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nespecially when someone calls up and\n\n607\n00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.420\nsays, my computer's\ndoing something strange.\n\n608\n00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.660\nWell, what is it doing?\n\n609\n00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.985\nAnd then they try to explain it.\n\n610\n00:29:06.985 --> 00:29:07.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n611\n00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:12.150\nyou're trying to explain something to\nthem on how you could do this or that.\n\n612\n00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.290\nAnd they're going, yeah,\nI don't see preferences.\n\n613\n00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:19.200\nIt's right there, you click the little\napp icon and you see system preferences,\n\n614\n00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.180\nI don't see that.\n\n615\n00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.490\nNo, it's there and the level of\nfrustrations can build really quickly.\n\n616\n00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:27.150\nSo just being able to go, let me just\nconnect to your computer through something\n\n617\n00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:31.870\nlike this, definitely a big help to\nus that are trying to help others.\n\n618\n00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.885\nSo, it's like help me to help you, right?\n\n619\n00:29:33.885 --> 00:29:37.920\n[LAUGH] Don, is there anything\nelse about Back to My Mac.\n\n620\n00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.040\nI mean, it's a really interesting\nfeature to be honest with you.\n\n621\n00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.280\nAnd it's all tied in through using iCloud.\n\n622\n00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just remember the big limitation\nis that in order to connect to it,\n\n623\n00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.510\nit's gotta be Mac to Mac.\n\n624\n00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:51.650\n&gt;&gt; So if you only own one Mac, Back to\nMy Mac it's not gonna help you very much.\n\n625\n00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:52.930\n&gt;&gt; Is even turning off, right?\n\n626\n00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.346\n&gt;&gt; Not really, yeah.\nSo it's really designed for\n\n627\n00:29:54.346 --> 00:29:56.009\npeople who have a desktop and the laptop.\n\n628\n00:29:56.009 --> 00:29:58.957\nFind my Mac, on the other hand, that's\nincredibly useful and you should turn\n\n629\n00:29:58.957 --> 00:30:01.922\nthat on on all your devices, definitely\nsomething you're gonna be aware of.\n\n630\n00:30:01.922 --> 00:30:02.882\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\n\n631\n00:30:02.882 --> 00:30:07.277\nas we've seen today there's a lot of great\nuseful features tied up when using iCloud.\n\n632\n00:30:07.277 --> 00:30:12.020\nSo create a free iCloud account and take\nadvantage of those things for yourself.\n\n633\n00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.880\nAnd if you're trying to study and\npass an exam, you're gonna need to know\n\n634\n00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.040\nthese little features, so\nthat you can do that very thing.\n\n635\n00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.840\nThat being said, Don,\nwe had a great day today but\n\n636\n00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.320\nour clock has ticked its last tock for\nthis episode.\n\n637\n00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.227\nWe do thank you for joining us,\nbut signing off for ITProTV,\n\n638\n00:30:26.227 --> 00:30:28.250\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n639\n00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.080\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n640\n00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:36.383\n&gt;&gt;

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:08.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.825\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n6\n00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:16.825\ngreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:18.975\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:21.995\nwell we are hitting you in the head\ntoday with some more ACSP.\n\n9\n00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:25.445\nSo hopefully you wore a helmet because\nDon here is gonna blow your mind.\n\n10\n00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:27.042\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, joining us in the studio,\n\n11\n00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:28.495\nyet again, our good friend, Mr Don Pezet.\n\n12\n00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:29.315\nDon, welcome back, man.\n\n13\n00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:29.835\nHow's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.985\n&gt;&gt; Hey, great to be back and ready to dive\nright back into ACSP like you said, but\n\n15\n00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:38.290\nin this particular episode we're gonna be\nfocusing on sharing resources and it's a-\n\n16\n00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.089\n&gt;&gt; In kindergarten, right?\n\n17\n00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:40.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Gotta learn to share.\n\n18\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.800\n&gt;&gt; Gotta learn to share.\n\n19\n00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.140\nPlay nice with your friends.\n\n20\n00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.960\nAnd as such we need our laptops and\n\n21\n00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.850\ndesktops to play nice\nwith each other as well.\n\n22\n00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.210\nAnd we've tactfully named the episode,\nSharing Resources,\n\n23\n00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.300\nbecause all too often we think of sharing,\nwe just think of sharing files.\n\n24\n00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.980\nI got a folder with some files in it,\nDana can access it.\n\n25\n00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.790\nGreat.\n\n26\n00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.540\nDone, right?\n\n27\n00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.274\nAnd that probably is the most\ncommon used case scenarios.\n\n28\n00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:02.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's why we think of it that way.\n\n29\n00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.920\nBut the reality is,\nmacOS is built on top of BSD UNIX.\n\n30\n00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.260\nAnd BSD UNIX is a network\noperating system.\n\n31\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.020\nIt's designed to be able to do all\nsorts of crazy stuff over the network\n\n32\n00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.380\nwell beyond just sharing files.\n\n33\n00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.330\nAlthough if we just wanted to pigeon hole\nourselves on sharing files there's like\n\n34\n00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.335\nfive different ways to share files\nacross the network on a Mac.\n\n35\n00:01:23.335 --> 00:01:24.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not even joking there.\n\n36\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.630\nThere's probably six or seven.\n\n37\n00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.160\nThere's five I'm gonna talk about today.\n\n38\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.910\nSo there's a lot of different\nways to do that, but\n\n39\n00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.170\nthere's plenty of other\nthings that we can share.\n\n40\n00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.520\nSo we're gonna dive into\nthe sharing resources section.\n\n41\n00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.640\nWe're gonna take a look at each of\nthe different items that we can share out.\n\n42\n00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.590\nAnd get an example of when we might\nuse them to determine whether or\n\n43\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.910\nnot it's even relevant,\ncuz some of them are older technologies,\n\n44\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.910\nolder protocols are therefore\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n45\n00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.570\nYou might ever need them, but\nit's nice to have them there if you do.\n\n46\n00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.680\nAnd then the latest and\ngreatest technologies are there also, and\n\n47\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.760\nthose are the ones we're\ngonna use on a regular basis.\n\n48\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.690\n&gt;&gt; All right Don we're\nfollowing you with this,\n\n49\n00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.280\ndefinitely where you think of sharing, we\nthink of file sharing cuz it's something\n\n50\n00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.830\nwe do on a regular basis or\nmostly likely anyway.\n\n51\n00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.830\nBut you kind of alluded to the fact\nthat there might be other things\n\n52\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.420\nwhich we share.\n\n53\n00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.903\nWell, can you give us a run\ndown of when you say resources,\n\n54\n00:02:06.903 --> 00:02:08.179\nwhat resources can we share?\n\n55\n00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.351\n&gt;&gt; All right, well if you go into\nyour System Preferences, right?\n\n56\n00:02:11.351 --> 00:02:13.500\nSo I'm gonna jump into my\nSystem Preferences here.\n\n57\n00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.990\nAnd you go into Sharing.\n\n58\n00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.706\nIt's even got a picture of\na stinking folder on there, right?\n\n59\n00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:20.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We immediately think files because\n\n60\n00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.230\nthat's kind of where it's lent itself.\n\n61\n00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.580\nBut if I click on Sharing,\nit's gonna take me to the sharing screens.\n\n62\n00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.430\nAnd it reminds you it jumped\nright to File Sharing.\n\n63\n00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.680\nIt's like this persistent thing.\n\n64\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.260\nBut I mean there is a whole list\nof stuff here that we can share.\n\n65\n00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.890\nAnd you'll see Screen Sharing,\nPrinter Sharing, Remote Login,\n\n66\n00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.060\nRemote Management, Remote Apple Events,\nInternet Sharing, Bluetooth Sharing.\n\n67\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.080\nAll of these different stuff showing\nup right here in the list, right?\n\n68\n00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.970\nThese are all different\nthings that we can share.\n\n69\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.200\nAnd there is even some others that\ndon't necessarily show up if you're\n\n70\n00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.480\nmissing a device, so for example,\nCD and DVD sharing, right?\n\n71\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.400\nNow Daniel, let's say,\nlet's create a scenario here.\n\n72\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.820\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; That I've got a CD, or a DVD,\n\n73\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.150\nand I need access to it.\n\n74\n00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.890\nDo you have a CD drive in your laptop?\n\n75\n00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.200\n&gt;&gt; I do not have a CD drive in my laptop.\n\n76\n00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.570\n&gt;&gt; I don't have one in mine either,\nnor on iMac in my office.\n\n77\n00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.680\nIn fact, no Mac currently\nsold today has a CD drive.\n\n78\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.020\nSo how do we get in to that?\n\n79\n00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.420\nWell, you know, we can always go and\nbuy the super drive.\n\n80\n00:03:21.355 --> 00:03:22.355\nWhich is not just [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It was super\n\n81\n00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:23.815\n&gt;&gt; It was actually kind of super when they\n\n82\n00:03:23.815 --> 00:03:26.675\nfirst came out a million years ago, but-\n&gt;&gt; It's super if you have a CD\n\n83\n00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:27.915\nyou need to use on your computer.\n\n84\n00:03:27.915 --> 00:03:29.125\nIt's amazing all of a sudden.\n\n85\n00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.183\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There is some truth to that.\n\n86\n00:03:30.183 --> 00:03:32.512\nSo if I need to access a CD or DVD.\n\n87\n00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:36.542\nOr if I need to burn a CD or a DVD I'm\ngonna have a hard time with that with my\n\n88\n00:03:36.542 --> 00:03:40.520\nbase unit, so I need to stick on\nsomething like this to be able to do it.\n\n89\n00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.080\nWell what if I have 100 people\nthat need to access the CD, right?\n\n90\n00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.050\nI'm at a school,\nwe've got a little lab set up.\n\n91\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.670\nThe kids have some kind of learning\nprogram and it's on a CD and\n\n92\n00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.520\nI need them all to access it.\n\n93\n00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.414\n&gt;&gt; That thing's gonna be a petri dish\nby the time it gets back to you.\n\n94\n00:03:51.414 --> 00:03:52.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well there's that, but\n\n95\n00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.440\nI'd also have to buy like\n100 of these things and\n\n96\n00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.770\nstick them on all the computers.\n\n97\n00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.730\nWell, if you tack one of these onto\nyour Mac, it'll actually enable CD and\n\n98\n00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.960\nDVD sharing.\n\n99\n00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.230\nAnd so when I plug that in, I'm gonna\nbasically be adding this CD drive here.\n\n100\n00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.320\nAnd it won't show up unless I put a CD in.\n\n101\n00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.820\nAnd sadly, before the show,\n\n102\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.872\nI was like man I don't even have\na CD where am I gonna do that?\n\n103\n00:04:12.872 --> 00:04:14.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well I just happen\n\n104\n00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.370\nto be a collector of vintage\nsoftware is my lame hobby.\n\n105\n00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.394\nAnd I have my copy of\nIBM OS2 handy here right?\n\n106\n00:04:20.394 --> 00:04:24.441\nSo if we need to revist 1990,\nI don't know.\n\n107\n00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:25.310\n&gt;&gt; Your computer's gonna reject that.\n\n108\n00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.400\n&gt;&gt; 1993 apparently.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; You're gonna plop that in,\n\n109\n00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.536\nand a trace is gonna come back out,\nyou know.\n\n110\n00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:31.807\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of almost\n\n111\n00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:34.180\na sacrilege to pop an IBM\noperating system into a Mac.\n\n112\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.780\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; But I'm gonna do it.\n\n113\n00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.780\nAnd so it's gonna pop in, and I'm now\ngonna have access to that CD, right?\n\n114\n00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.830\nSo that's spectacular, it will appear\nright here on my desktop any moment.\n\n115\n00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.650\nThe glorious part about\nCDs is how slow they are,\n\n116\n00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.220\nwhich is why we don't like to use them.\n\n117\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.490\nMost people have moved over to things like\nUSB keys like this little jabbie, and so\n\n118\n00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.010\nwe don't see these so often.\n\n119\n00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.620\nBut I've got it now and there is my CD\nshowing up on my desktop and I double\n\n120\n00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.340\nclick on it right there, there is my CD,\nI can browse in and access the resource.\n\n121\n00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.290\nMore importantly though, I can share this\ndisk with other people on my network.\n\n122\n00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.710\nAnd if I go back into my\nsystem preferences and\n\n123\n00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.860\nI go back into sharing, I've got a nice\nnew option that just appeared right there.\n\n124\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.433\nThat option wasn't there before because\nI didn't have a CD or DVD drive.\n\n125\n00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:16.890\nBut now I do.\n\n126\n00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.670\nAnd when you select that, there's not\na whole lot to configure on this one,\n\n127\n00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.590\nwe check it off and we say hey, CD and\n\n128\n00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.790\nDVD sharing is now turned on and\nit's ready to go.\n\n129\n00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.940\nThe only option we have is ask me before\nallowing others to use my DVD drive, okay.\n\n130\n00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.876\n&gt;&gt; So Don I should just be able to\njump in my finder on my Mac and\n\n131\n00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:35.601\nfind that resource now?\n\n132\n00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:36.809\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it uses Bonjour, so\n\n133\n00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:39.750\nI'm advertising my drive now your\nmachine should automatically see it.\n\n134\n00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.088\nIf you launch your finder and\ngo ahead and do it.\n\n135\n00:05:41.088 --> 00:05:42.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah let's give it a whirl.\n\n136\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.000\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna launch your finder and\nin the left side navigation of the finder\n\n137\n00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.150\nthere's a section called devices and\nunder devices you should see remote disk.\n\n138\n00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.970\nNow remote disk won't show up\nunless somebody on your network is\n\n139\n00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:53.780\nsharing a disk.\n\n140\n00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.600\nI am so ECs Don's Mac Book pro.\n\n141\n00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.260\n&gt;&gt; No disk.\n\n142\n00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.360\n&gt;&gt; And what you should be\nable to do is click on it,\n\n143\n00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.690\nnow\n&gt;&gt; I've turned on the Ask Me for\n\n144\n00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:02.890\nPermission button.\n\n145\n00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.290\nSo normally, if you don't have Ask for\nPermission turned on, you'd click on it,\n\n146\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.230\nand you'd see the disk.\n\n147\n00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.103\nYou'd have access to what was on that CD.\n\n148\n00:06:08.103 --> 00:06:10.153\nBut because I have Ask for\nPermission turned on,\n\n149\n00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:12.390\nhe's got a little button\nup at the top right.\n\n150\n00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.100\nAnd what does it say, like ask-\n&gt;&gt; It says Ask To Use, there you go.\n\n151\n00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.500\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, go ahead and hit that one.\n\n152\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.520\nAnd what's gonna happen is,\nhe's gonna ask me, and\n\n153\n00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.150\nI get a little pop up on my screen,\nwhich I can see it right here,\n\n154\n00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.830\nthat Daniel Lowrie is asking for\npermission to use the DVD drive.\n\n155\n00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.490\nAnd I'll go ahead and accept that.\n\n156\n00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.250\nAnd so, now I'm allowing him to use it.\n\n157\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.860\nAnd back on his screen,\nhe now sees my CD drive.\n\n158\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.640\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n159\n00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.730\n&gt;&gt; And it's the drive that I've shared,\nnot necessarily the disk inside of it.\n\n160\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.570\nSo if I start changing out disks,\n\n161\n00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.200\nhe'll just see whatever disk\nI've got in there at the time.\n\n162\n00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.640\nAnd he's able to work with it and\nuse that disk and access the contents.\n\n163\n00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.270\nNow, the contents on this disk\nare not gonna render exactly right,\n\n164\n00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.990\nbecause it's a OS2 disc.\n\n165\n00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.628\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's very, very ancient, but\n\n166\n00:06:50.628 --> 00:06:52.623\nat this point,\nhe's able to see the drive though-\n\n167\n00:06:52.623 --> 00:06:53.288\n&gt;&gt; Look, there it is.\n\n168\n00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:54.413\n&gt;&gt; And access the contents.\n\n169\n00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:55.880\nIt's really, really slow.\n\n170\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.880\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI guess it's having to read the disk and\n\n171\n00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.700\nthen send that information\nover the network connection.\n\n172\n00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And it just took a minute.\n\n173\n00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.170\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; But at the end of the day you've got\n\n174\n00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.460\nthat, even in your desktop,\nsee how you've mounted the CD?\n\n175\n00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.617\nYou've actually got the CD icon up there.\n\n176\n00:07:07.617 --> 00:07:12.233\nSo as far as Daniel's Mac Book is\nconcerned, he now has a CD drive, and\n\n177\n00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:17.420\nthere is a CD in the tray, so I don't\nhave to go out and buy 100 super drives.\n\n178\n00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.290\nI can have this one disk showing up\nall across the different machines And\n\n179\n00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.590\nnow we're able to access that software.\n\n180\n00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.110\nSo that's sharing,\nnot just a file or a folder, but\n\n181\n00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.060\nthe entire DVD drive itself being\nshared out across the network.\n\n182\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.930\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n183\n00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.975\nAll right, Don, what else can we do\nwith this resource sharing business?\n\n184\n00:07:33.975 --> 00:07:35.725\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell some of the other things we can do,\n\n185\n00:07:35.725 --> 00:07:39.525\nif we take a look at our list,\nthe very next item here is Screen Sharing.\n\n186\n00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:42.655\nAnd we talked about screen sharing\nin the back to my Mac show,\n\n187\n00:07:42.655 --> 00:07:47.032\nthat if you wanna be able to remotely\nview the screen of your laptop or\n\n188\n00:07:47.032 --> 00:07:50.422\na desktop you can turn that on and\nthen jump in and connect to it.\n\n189\n00:07:50.422 --> 00:07:53.733\nSo that's another thing that we can share\nout again, we've already seen that one.\n\n190\n00:07:53.733 --> 00:07:55.579\nWe've got file sharing.\n\n191\n00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:57.360\nFile sharing we've also already seen.\n\n192\n00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.781\nWe talked about sharing\nacross the network.\n\n193\n00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:01.794\nBack in some of our earlier episodes but\n\n194\n00:08:01.794 --> 00:08:04.480\nI do wanna highlight some\ndetails that we can get to.\n\n195\n00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.030\nCuz we focused more on permissions and\nthings on that episodes.\n\n196\n00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.890\nWe were talking about in the users home\ndirectory of a public folder that is\n\n197\n00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.690\nshared out by default which you can see\n\n198\n00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.220\nI've got a public folder that\nis shared out by default.\n\n199\n00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.840\nAnd various users have access to that,\nright?\n\n200\n00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.670\nI have read and write staff, which is\nanybody who has a user account on this\n\n201\n00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.790\ncomputer has read only and\nthen everyone else has read only.\n\n202\n00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.460\nNow I say everyone else has account on\nthe computer well you got Daniel Lowrie,\n\n203\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.860\nhe's got an account in my computer and\nso he would have access to my public\n\n204\n00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.390\nfolder as well It's my public folder\nit says what I intend, right?\n\n205\n00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.640\nAnd then I've got like a podcast\nfolder I'm sharing out and\n\n206\n00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.820\nthere is my local users that have access\nto it and a couple of unknown users.\n\n207\n00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.190\nThose unknown users are coming from a\ndirectory that's not turned on right now.\n\n208\n00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.580\nIn one of our earlier shows I had brought\nup an Apple open directory server and\n\n209\n00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.190\nthat's where those accounts reside so\nthey're not resolving right now cuz that\n\n210\n00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.568\nopen directory server is off and\nI'll probably just get those out of there.\n\n211\n00:08:57.568 --> 00:09:00.780\nSince I don't necessarily need them,\nso we can take them out.\n\n212\n00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.480\nAll right, but you can share\nany kind of file and folder and\n\n213\n00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.660\nmake it available on your network,\nthat's something we've already seen.\n\n214\n00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.990\nBut we didn't talk about though and\n\n215\n00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.250\nwhat I wanna talk about right\nnow are the different protocols.\n\n216\n00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.250\nIf I go into the options,\nyou can see how I'm sharing things, right?\n\n217\n00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.330\nAnd I can see that I'm sharing\nwith various accounts and\n\n218\n00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:24.850\nthere is two different protocols\nthat I can choose from, SMB and AFP.\n\n219\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.650\nNow, I haven't adjusted these.\n\n220\n00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.700\nThese are kind of they're defaults.\n\n221\n00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.300\nAnd the first one is SMB or\nsever message block, and\n\n222\n00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.750\nthat's actually a Microsoft protocol.\n\n223\n00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.920\nAnd AFP or Apple File Protocol,\nthat's an Apple protocol.\n\n224\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.230\nSo isn't it odd, that the Microsoft\nwould be turned on by default and\n\n225\n00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.880\nthe Apple would be turned off by default?\n\n226\n00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.640\nThat doesn't make any sense,\nthis is an Apple product.\n\n227\n00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.980\nWell, Apple acknowledges that in the\nbusiness world, in environments where you\n\n228\n00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.970\nshare files and folders,\nMicrosoft kinda dominates that market.\n\n229\n00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.750\nYou have a ton of Microsoft files\nservers that are out there.\n\n230\n00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.050\nIt's rare to encounter Mac file servers.\n\n231\n00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.900\nNow talking to you guys, to this audience.\n\n232\n00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.550\nYou're probably thinking, well that's not\ntrue, I have all Macs in my business.\n\n233\n00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.900\nAnd there's plenty of businesses\nlike that, but by and\n\n234\n00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.820\nlarge, Microsoft kind of\ncontrols that market.\n\n235\n00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.940\nSo what Apple does is they wanna make\nsure that you can use a Mac seamlessly in\n\n236\n00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.060\neither environment.\n\n237\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:18.020\nAnd Mac's support both, SMB and\nAFP, so we can share files and\n\n238\n00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.890\nfolders by using Server Message Block or\nvia Apple File Protocol.\n\n239\n00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.000\nNow if I can use either one,\nhow do I pick, right?\n\n240\n00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.500\nWell, if you're integrating with Windows\nmachines it's not much of a choice.\n\n241\n00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.010\nYou're going to need to use SMB, right?\n\n242\n00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.475\nBut if you're just operating in a Mac only\nenvironment, you've kind of got a choice.\n\n243\n00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:37.982\nYou can use SMB or AFP and\nyou can actually turn them\n\n244\n00:10:37.982 --> 00:10:41.043\nboth on at the same time, so\nnow I'm doing both, all right?\n\n245\n00:10:41.043 --> 00:10:47.340\nNow the problem I'm gonna bump into\nis that Macs will use SMB by default.\n\n246\n00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.940\nSo I have them both turned\non it'll still use SMB.\n\n247\n00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.570\nIt'll only use AFP if SMB fails.\n\n248\n00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.520\nIn other words if I turn it off, and\n\n249\n00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.980\nthen I start using AFP, otherwise it\nonly uses AFP if I manually tell it.\n\n250\n00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.520\nAnd you can manually tell it what\nprotocol to use when connecting right.\n\n251\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:09.280\nIf I'm in my finder and I use the Go menu\nup top and choose Connect to Server.\n\n252\n00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.008\nWhen I do that, connect to server,\nI can come in and I can type,\n\n253\n00:11:13.008 --> 00:11:18.370\nsmb:// and\nthen the server I wanna connect to, right?\n\n254\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.340\nSlash public or whatever right?\n\n255\n00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.920\nOr I can say AFP right?\n\n256\n00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.480\nSo I can type that in,\n\n257\n00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.090\nand if I type it in here I'm forcing\nit to use one protocol over the other.\n\n258\n00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.670\nBut if I just use the regular\nold finder right so\n\n259\n00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.830\nin the finder if I go over here and\nI come down to shared and\n\n260\n00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.022\nI find a system on my network like I\nwas trying to go to lab server 01.\n\n261\n00:11:40.022 --> 00:11:42.100\nAnd I double-click on it and\n\n262\n00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.290\nI browse the HelpDesk's Public Folder,\nwhich protocol do you think it just used?\n\n263\n00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.870\nIt used SMB, right?\n\n264\n00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.780\nSo unless I force it to use AFP,\nit's not going to.\n\n265\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.820\nNow in an all Mac world,\nyou might actually prefer AFP.\n\n266\n00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.800\nI usually do, right?\n\n267\n00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.410\nAnd here's why,\nApple didn't license SMB from Microsoft.\n\n268\n00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.240\nThere's several areas where Apple licensed\ncertain technologies from Microsoft to\n\n269\n00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.660\nensure compatibility.\n\n270\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.770\nBut SMB is not one of them.\n\n271\n00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:11.310\nSo what Apple did is they used an open\nsource product called the Samba.\n\n272\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:16.960\nAnd the Samba team, they're open source\ndevelopers, they reverse engineered SMB.\n\n273\n00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.590\nAnd so they tried to figure out\nhow the protocol worked and\n\n274\n00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.010\nget it where you could communicate.\n\n275\n00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.640\nAnd as a result they created this open\nsource solution that works great and\n\n276\n00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.840\nApple integrated it into their product.\n\n277\n00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.230\nAnd Apple's contributed a good\nbit of code to that too.\n\n278\n00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.830\nThe problem is there's\nmultiple versions of SMB.\n\n279\n00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.450\nMicrosoft is up to SMB version 4 now.\n\n280\n00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:36.680\nBut the version of SMB found in\nMac OS Sierra is only SMB version 3.\n\n281\n00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.570\nSo there's certain features\nlike in transit encryption and\n\n282\n00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:44.650\nthings like that, that don't work\nunder the SMB implementation on a Mac.\n\n283\n00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.120\nSo if you ever encounter\nproblems on the network,\n\n284\n00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.240\nlike when you're trying to communicate,\nthat can be an issue.\n\n285\n00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.052\nNow if you're using SMB from one Mac to\nanother, obviously they are only gonna use\n\n286\n00:12:52.052 --> 00:12:54.036\nfeatures that they support,\nand so it's gonna be fine.\n\n287\n00:12:54.036 --> 00:12:56.997\nBut in a mixed environment, it could\nstart to be a bit of a headache, so\n\n288\n00:12:56.997 --> 00:12:59.811\nyou might choose to turn one feature off,\nor one protocol off, and\n\n289\n00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:02.297\nforce the other one,\ndepending on what you need, right?\n\n290\n00:13:02.297 --> 00:13:04.961\nAnd in the GUI they only show SMB and\nAFP, but\n\n291\n00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:08.710\nthere's plenty of others\nthat are supported by a Mac.\n\n292\n00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:13.330\nA Mac can be an FTP server as well as an\nFTP client, right, File Transfer Protocol.\n\n293\n00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.490\nIt can do NFS, the Network File System,\nthat's a core Unix feature so\n\n294\n00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.760\nwe can share files and resources via NFS.\n\n295\n00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.830\nIt's just not in the GUI, but\nyou have that capability.\n\n296\n00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.140\nRemember, I said there's like five\ndifferent ways to share files and folders.\n\n297\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.050\nI didn't mention iCloud Drive,\n\n298\n00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.900\nthat's another way that we can share\nresources between our own machines.\n\n299\n00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.890\nSo these are all different things that we\ncan leverage if we need to get in there\n\n300\n00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:35.595\nand start to share those files and\nfolders.\n\n301\n00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.340\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\nwhat about printers, right?\n\n302\n00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.130\nPrinter is just probably one of the more\ncommon things that we like to share inside\n\n303\n00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.360\nof our as a resource right?\n\n304\n00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, it used to be a given, that\nwhen you went into a business there was\n\n305\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.831\ngoing to be a shared\nprinter on the network.\n\n306\n00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:57.110\nIn today's age though, when you buy a new\nprinter almost every printer has a network\n\n307\n00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.340\njerk on it or\nconnects to your wireless network.\n\n308\n00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:05.290\nAnd that's kind of better, in the older\ndays when every printer had a serial or\n\n309\n00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.010\nparallel connection, or\nmaybe a USB, or whatever.\n\n310\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.300\nYou would pick a computer,\nplug the printer into that one computer.\n\n311\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.300\nAnd only that one computer has an access\nunless you share it on the network.\n\n312\n00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.130\nAnd that's what we did, we would\nshare that printer on the network.\n\n313\n00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.710\nOn the positive side, all of the other\ncomputers in my network could now use that\n\n314\n00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.070\none printer, that was good.\n\n315\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.360\nOn a negative side,\n\n316\n00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.400\nwhat would happen if I turned off the\ncomputer that printer was plugged into?\n\n317\n00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.460\n&gt;&gt; No one would have access.\n\n318\n00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's a bit of a weakness and\nthat's why in newer printers, they have\n\n319\n00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.390\ntheir own network jack or they have their\nown WiFi capabilities to be able to\n\n320\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.260\nconnect to the network and that way\nthere's no computer that they're tied to.\n\n321\n00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.900\nBut if you still have a printer\nthat doesn't support that,\n\n322\n00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.490\nyou can share it natively through Mac OS.\n\n323\n00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.270\nAnd that's what the option is right here.\n\n324\n00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.310\nRight after File Sharing,\nyou'll see Printer Sharing.\n\n325\n00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.100\nAnd any printer that you've connected to,\neven network printers, right?\n\n326\n00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.050\nThese are two network printers\nthat I've connected to.\n\n327\n00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.730\nI can take them and\nI can share them out and\n\n328\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.300\nnow other people would be able to\nfind the printer on my system.\n\n329\n00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.530\nNow there's not a whole lot\nthat we could tweak here,\n\n330\n00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:05.640\nyou'll basically you pick a printer and\nyou turn on sharing and enable it and\n\n331\n00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.625\nonce it's enabled,\nyou'll then sharing it out.\n\n332\n00:15:07.625 --> 00:15:08.790\nSo get at it.\n\n333\n00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.950\nIf I choose the Open Printers &amp;\nScanners Preferences and go in there,\n\n334\n00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:16.950\nwhat we're seeing here, really the options\nto tweak the individual printers.\n\n335\n00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:20.290\nAnd that's important because each\nprinter has its own sharing settings.\n\n336\n00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.460\nWhen I look at this first\nlaser jet that I chose,\n\n337\n00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.930\nthere's share this printer on the network.\n\n338\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.440\nAnd I can go into the sharing preferences,\nand it takes me right back,\n\n339\n00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.820\nkind of full circle to where I was before,\nwhere we can go in and\n\n340\n00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.600\nenables functionality and turn it on or\noff or whatever it is that we want, right?\n\n341\n00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.610\nSo you can enable that if you need it\non your network and get that setup so\n\n342\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:40.940\nyou're sharing those printers.\n\n343\n00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.200\nNow in my case, because both are in\nmy network, it's hard to see here.\n\n344\n00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.860\nI don't know, maybe if I zoom in.\n\n345\n00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.157\nThat see how I'm clicking,\nthat's not checking.\n\n346\n00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:50.021\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nothing's actually happening.\n\n347\n00:15:50.021 --> 00:15:52.325\n&gt;&gt; I don't actually have\na physical printer to share out.\n\n348\n00:15:52.325 --> 00:15:56.279\nAnd if I'm connected to a network printer,\nit doesn't really make sense to share it\n\n349\n00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:59.525\nout because it's already in there\npeople should connect directly.\n\n350\n00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:00.997\nThere is one scenario for that though,\n\n351\n00:16:00.997 --> 00:16:03.411\nlike you wanna setup some kind\nof centralized printer servers.\n\n352\n00:16:03.411 --> 00:16:06.900\nSo you can control the print jobs, then\nyou might wanna get involved in that, but\n\n353\n00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.904\nusually don't, and\nthat's why it's grayed out on here.\n\n354\n00:16:09.904 --> 00:16:13.773\n&gt;&gt; It's not like time you would probably\njust wanna create like a local logical\n\n355\n00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:18.082\nprinter, where people can actually connect\nto the printer will just make the file.\n\n356\n00:16:18.082 --> 00:16:20.250\n&gt;&gt; I've seen those.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe there's something like that.\n\n357\n00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:21.610\n&gt;&gt; Adobe Acrobat does that, right?\n\n358\n00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.890\nIt creates that little PDF distiller or\nwhatever.\n\n359\n00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.700\nAnd that would count as a physical\nprinter because it shows as being\n\n360\n00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.720\nlocal to your system.\n\n361\n00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, I noticed the next\nitem on your little bulleted list\n\n362\n00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.000\nthere was Remote Login love Remote Login.\n\n363\n00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.150\nI'm able to say hey, here's a computer,\nI can leave it at home,\n\n364\n00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.960\nI can put it up in the cloud,\nwhatever the case is.\n\n365\n00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.940\nAnd remotely access it and we have a cool\ncouple of ways in which you can do that\n\n366\n00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.390\nand even send or receive files, right?\n\n367\n00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.181\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, this Remote Login is a little\ndifferent than what a lot of people think,\n\n368\n00:16:51.181 --> 00:16:53.779\na lot of people here Remote Login and\nthink back to my Mac,\n\n369\n00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:56.510\nlike I can see the screen of\nthat other computer, right.\n\n370\n00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.913\nAnd with something like back to my Mac\nthat's exactly true, you can do that,\n\n371\n00:17:00.913 --> 00:17:05.589\nyou can remotely see the screen But Remote\nLogin is more for management purposes,\n\n372\n00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:08.280\nmore for\naccessing the Unix backend of macOS.\n\n373\n00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.160\nSo I don't normally use remote\nlog in on most of my clients.\n\n374\n00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.270\nSo it's other technologies we'll\nsee here a little bit better that\n\n375\n00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.310\nwork better for that.\n\n376\n00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:18.335\nBut on a server, it can work really well.\n\n377\n00:17:18.335 --> 00:17:19.770\nLet me give you an example.\n\n378\n00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.170\nSo I'm gonna go over here to my server.\n\n379\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:26.323\nAnd remember, when I say server\nthis is just a regular Mac,\n\n380\n00:17:26.323 --> 00:17:31.490\nit's running macOS Sierra,\nthat I installed the server app on, right?\n\n381\n00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.167\nSo if you were going to the app store and\nsearch for survy, you'll find it in there.\n\n382\n00:17:35.167 --> 00:17:38.240\nIt's $20, you get it install,\nand now you got a server, right?\n\n383\n00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.945\nSo it's really not much to it so\nthere it is.\n\n384\n00:17:40.945 --> 00:17:43.360\nMacOS Server I've already\ngot it installed.\n\n385\n00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.390\nThere's apparently an update for\nit but that's fine.\n\n386\n00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:48.320\nSo, all I've done is kind of\n\n387\n00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.280\nremoved icons from the desktop to\nmake it look a little cleaner.\n\n388\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.760\nThat's what I do on a server and\nnow here's my server.\n\n389\n00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.530\nNow when I manage a server,\nI can use the server app to do it.\n\n390\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.210\nRight, that's one way.\n\n391\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.410\nI can use back to my Mac to go and\nsee the screen of the server.\n\n392\n00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.260\nOr if I just wanna run scripts or\n\n393\n00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:10.470\ntransfer files like Daniel mentioned\nI might wanna use SSH or SFTP.\n\n394\n00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.750\nSSH is the secure shell protocol.\n\n395\n00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.110\nIf you open up a terminal on your system.\n\n396\n00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.560\nThat terminal that you're looking\nat is what's called a shell.\n\n397\n00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.840\nAnd a shell is what gives you\naccess to that Unix backend, right.\n\n398\n00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.110\nSo if I pull up the Unix name,\nI can see this is,\n\n399\n00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:30.780\nDarwin, is the codename of the underlying\noperating system but it's PSD.\n\n400\n00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.450\nAnd I can jump in here and\ndo all the various things that I wanna\n\n401\n00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:38.450\nyou to manage the system all the UNIX\ncommands that I might be used to,\n\n402\n00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.750\nI can run scripts I can do\nother actions all via a shell.\n\n403\n00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.070\nBut this shell is running\nright on the server itself.\n\n404\n00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.930\nWith SSH I can securely\naccess the shell remotely.\n\n405\n00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:55.600\nI can get an encrypted connection to\nthe server and I can see this prompt.\n\n406\n00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.840\nI mean, it works on a work station too,\nbecause really the work station and\n\n407\n00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.370\nserver's the same thing.\n\n408\n00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.910\nThe only difference really is\ninstalling one little app.\n\n409\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.310\nThe app doesn't even add any\nsoftware on the back end.\n\n410\n00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.270\nThe app is really just a GUI to manage\nthe software that's already there,\n\n411\n00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.740\nbut hidden on a work station.\n\n412\n00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.860\nSo really they are identical.\n\n413\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:17.920\nNow, if I want to do file transfers,\nwe can do FTP, the file transfer protocol.\n\n414\n00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.600\nNow, be careful,\nthere's two ways to do file transfers.\n\n415\n00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.130\nOne is through the server app.\n\n416\n00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.030\nIf I go into the server app itself.\n\n417\n00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:30.350\nLet me log in to it real quick,\njust needed to authenticate,\n\n418\n00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.590\nand I get the server app.\n\n419\n00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:36.350\nThis server app actually has\nan FTP Server built into it, right?\n\n420\n00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:43.050\nBut that is not controlled by the Remote\nLogin that we're talking about here.\n\n421\n00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.860\nWhen I go into the server app,\non the left side here,\n\n422\n00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.330\nif we scroll down,\nwe get down to advance, you'll find FTP.\n\n423\n00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.560\nFTP is the old file transfer protocol.\n\n424\n00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.310\nAnd it is designed for unencrypted\nfile transfers over the network.\n\n425\n00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.810\nIt's not very safe,\nit's not very secure, right?\n\n426\n00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.820\nWell notice how my FTP server.\n\n427\n00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.580\nWell, if I turn it on, it's turned on.\n\n428\n00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.280\nAnd it's tied right now\nto my website's root.\n\n429\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.380\nIf I FTP into this server, I'll end up in\nthe root of the website directory where\n\n430\n00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.620\nthe system stores the websites.\n\n431\n00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.290\nWell, that's if I do FTP.\n\n432\n00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.590\nSFTP, the secure file transfer protocol,\n\n433\n00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.430\nit's building an encrypted session and\nit's using the remote shell.\n\n434\n00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.400\nIt's using SSH to build it.\n\n435\n00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.090\nAnd so, when that happens it's not\neven connecting to this FTP Service.\n\n436\n00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:32.830\nIt's connecting to SSH and\ngetting a true shell and\n\n437\n00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.730\nit'll have full access to the entire file\nsystem regardless of how this is set up.\n\n438\n00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.430\nAnd that functionality is included\nin every workstation and server so\n\n439\n00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.220\nit doesn't matter.\n\n440\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:47.260\nEvery Mac OS product sold today has\nthat functionality if it's turned on.\n\n441\n00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.040\nSo on this server if I go\ninto my system preferences\n\n442\n00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:58.210\nand I go into sharing,\nI can go to Remote Login.\n\n443\n00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:03.970\nAnd I can turn it on and when I turn it\non that's going to enable both SSH and\n\n444\n00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.820\nSFTP access to this system and then I\ncan dictate who's allowed to access it.\n\n445\n00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:12.210\nSo by default these administrators, I'll\nsee I'm in the list and Mike Rodrick and\n\n446\n00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.050\nwhoever else that I want to enable but\nthat's it.\n\n447\n00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.430\nIt doesn't let me pick\nthings like folders or\n\n448\n00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:22.380\nfiles that I'm holding people to, it just\nsets that access up and there it is.\n\n449\n00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.010\nNow, I can switch over to a client.\n\n450\n00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:29.911\nActually let me figure out my IP address\nreal quick before I switch to a client.\n\n451\n00:21:29.911 --> 00:21:33.730\nAnd I can see my IP is 192.168.0.11.\n\n452\n00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:39.100\nSo I can switch over to a client, like\nmy laptop I can open up a terminal here.\n\n453\n00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.730\nAnd in my terminal I can\nreach out to that server.\n\n454\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.070\nNow right now,\n\n455\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:49.280\nif I type hostname I can see I'm\nconnected to Dons MacBook Pro local.\n\n456\n00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:54.160\nAll right,\nif I do ssh followed by a user name,\n\n457\n00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.400\nthe username I have on\nthis server is helpdesk.\n\n458\n00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.400\nAnd then we say @, and\nthe IP address of the server.\n\n459\n00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.713\nI can punch that in.\n\n460\n00:22:01.713 --> 00:22:03.670\nAnd it's gonna reach out and\nconnect to the server.\n\n461\n00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.040\nNow it's an encrypted session.\n\n462\n00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.950\nSo it's gonna show me the fingerprint\nof the certificate for the server.\n\n463\n00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.920\nIt's gonna say,\nis this the right fingerprint, right?\n\n464\n00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.100\nIf I've defined that on the server,\nI would need to compare to look and\n\n465\n00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.820\nmake sure that is the right one.\n\n466\n00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.350\nIf it is, we say yes.\n\n467\n00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.970\nAnd now I can provide my\npassword to get logged in.\n\n468\n00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:23.390\nAnd when I'm login I get a shell, right?\n\n469\n00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:27.560\nAnd if I type host name,\nI can see that I'm now on lab-server01.\n\n470\n00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:32.040\nI'm now login to that server's shell,\nand I can remotely administer it.\n\n471\n00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.730\nI can take a look at how\nmuch disk space it has,\n\n472\n00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:38.870\nI can take a look at what processes are\nrunning and consuming the most resources.\n\n473\n00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:39.900\nI can reboot it.\n\n474\n00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:47.280\nI can do all sorts of tasks\nremotely via an encrypted session.\n\n475\n00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.470\nAnd via that same session,\nwe can do file transfer.\n\n476\n00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.330\nWe can do SFTP, secure file transfer.\n\n477\n00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:57.685\nSo, if I get out of that so now I'm\nback on to my own little laptop, right?\n\n478\n00:22:57.685 --> 00:23:01.865\nThat you have an SFTP client that you can\nuse and it works basically the same way.\n\n479\n00:23:01.865 --> 00:23:07.395\nWe say, sftp and\nwe specify a user like helpdesk and\n\n480\n00:23:07.395 --> 00:23:11.635\nwe'll point it at that machine and\nit will ask for a password.\n\n481\n00:23:11.635 --> 00:23:14.785\nAnd once I'm connected,\nhere I am and ops, and\n\n482\n00:23:14.785 --> 00:23:17.210\nif I can type I can pull up a directory.\n\n483\n00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:23.790\nAnd if I look at the directory,\nI'm in /Users/helpdesk.\n\n484\n00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:27.030\nI'm not in the websites folder that\nthe sftp server was defaulting to.\n\n485\n00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.580\nIn fact, I turned the FTP Server off.\n\n486\n00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:29.890\nI'm not even using that, right?\n\n487\n00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.130\nThis is built-in to the operating system.\n\n488\n00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:36.680\nBut if I start browsing around,\nI can get into /Volumes and\n\n489\n00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:40.400\nnow I can access All of\nthe storage that's on that system.\n\n490\n00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.350\nI might have things like\ntime machine back ups right?\n\n491\n00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:49.684\nAnd in another episode we set up time\nmachine and it, that didn't work.\n\n492\n00:23:49.684 --> 00:23:53.930\nShared items, there we go.\n\n493\n00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.660\nAnd I can browse in here and start to\nfind the backups that were taken for\n\n494\n00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.130\nother machines and transfer those.\n\n495\n00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.330\nMaybe I wanna back them up\nsomewhere externally or whatever.\n\n496\n00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.440\nWe can do that via this\ntype of connection.\n\n497\n00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.660\nSo, this type of a connection is not\ndesigned for regular end-users Right.\n\n498\n00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.361\nYour regular home Mac user is not going\nto know what to do with this stuff.\n\n499\n00:24:12.361 --> 00:24:15.090\n&gt;&gt; They're going to look at that and\ngo, what are you talking about?\n\n500\n00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.590\nThis is witchcraft or something.\n\n501\n00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.650\n&gt;&gt; But, for administrators, for us,\nwe can take advantage of that and\n\n502\n00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.120\nreally use it to completely\nremote control a device.\n\n503\n00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.390\nWhich is very, very beneficial\nin an enterprise environment.\n\n504\n00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:29.960\n&gt;&gt; Now, it's interesting, Danny,\nyou were mentioning this is basically for\n\n505\n00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.170\nremote management.\n\n506\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.755\nAnd then, we look at our list there.\n\n507\n00:24:32.755 --> 00:24:35.963\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it says, Remote Managements, so\n\n508\n00:24:35.963 --> 00:24:37.840\nwhy is that not in here?\n\n509\n00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.490\nAnd what is Remote Management,\nwhy is there a difference?\n\n510\n00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:42.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so looking at our list, as we\ngo down the things that we can share,\n\n511\n00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.640\nRemote Login and Remote Management\nthey're right after each other.\n\n512\n00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.935\nAnd when you click on them,\nthey practically look the same.\n\n513\n00:24:47.935 --> 00:24:49.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, they do.\n\n514\n00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.370\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nYou can turn one on, or one off.\n\n515\n00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:55.988\nWell, remote management is actually\nsomething very, very different.\n\n516\n00:24:55.988 --> 00:24:57.680\nAnd it's gonna take we\na while to get into it, so\n\n517\n00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.840\nwe'll have to get into it in part two.\n\n518\n00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.840\nBut just to sum it up real quickly.\n\n519\n00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.510\nApple has a product called,\nApple Remove Desktop or ARD.\n\n520\n00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.240\nARD is very powerful.\n\n521\n00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.180\nIf you're managing a network of MAC's,\nyou should have ARD.\n\n522\n00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.960\nAnd what it let's you do is connect to.\n\n523\n00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.259\nOne, ten, 100, 1000, 10,000 machines?\n\n524\n00:25:17.259 --> 00:25:20.850\nAnd you can deploy software to them,\nyou can view their logs,\n\n525\n00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:24.250\nyou can remotely pull up their\nscreen to see whats going on.\n\n526\n00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.270\nYou can manage your\nentire network using it.\n\n527\n00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:31.350\nNow, I can do a lot of that with\nthe other protocols that are here, but\n\n528\n00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.720\nit's not centrally managed,\n\n529\n00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.280\nit's not all done in one place, it's not\ngot an easy GUI that makes things simple.\n\n530\n00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.310\nAnd that's what Apple Remote Desktop does.\n\n531\n00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:40.590\nSo I want to spend some time with that.\n\n532\n00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.140\nI want to show you guys how ARD works,-\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n533\n00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.570\n&gt;&gt; I just don't have enough\ntime in this episode.\n\n534\n00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:47.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So let's go onto\na part two, and we'll take a look at ARD.\n\n535\n00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.610\nAnd then we still have a few other\nthings we haven't really talked about,\n\n536\n00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:50.610\nlike Internet sharing and\n\n537\n00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:53.760\nbluetooth to sharing, which aren't nearly\nas fun anymore as they used to be.\n\n538\n00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; But\ndouble we'll take a look at those, but\n\n539\n00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.010\nARD I definitely want\nto spend some time on.\n\n540\n00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:58.950\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, sounds great.\n\n541\n00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:02.460\nWe hope that you will join us in that\npart two, see how that works out, and\n\n542\n00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.929\nwatch Dnn fumble around-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n543\n00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:04.969\n&gt;&gt; And make mistakes, right?\n\n544\n00:26:04.969 --> 00:26:06.050\nNot that he ever does that.\n\n545\n00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:06.780\nIt never occurs,-\n&gt;&gt; Never.\n\n546\n00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.138\n&gt;&gt; Never occurs.\nI'll keep that on the down low.\n\n547\n00:26:08.138 --> 00:26:08.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n548\n00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.140\nAll right, Don, thanks for\njoining us today.\n\n549\n00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.330\nWe do thank you,\nour audience out here, for watching.\n\n550\n00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.680\nBut we're gonna sign off.\n\n551\n00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.980\nFor ITPRO.TV I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n552\n00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.950\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n553\n00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.368\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n554\n00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:24.290\n[MUSIC]\n\n555\n00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.186\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:16.275\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:18.465\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:21.825\nin today's episode well we're\nback with more ACSP content.\n\n9\n00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:25.079\nAnd joining us in the studio for\na part two on sharing resources,\n\n10\n00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.715\nour good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:27.945\nDon welcome back man.\n\n12\n00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:28.795\nGlad to have you again.\n\n13\n00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.385\n&gt;&gt; All right Daniel, ready to dive\nright back in and cause some trouble.\n\n14\n00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.375\nAt the end of the last episode we were\ntalking about some of the different remote\n\n15\n00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.340\nmanagement options that were\navailable inside of Mac OS.\n\n16\n00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.800\nAnd I started talking a little bit\nabout ARD or Apple Remote Desktop,\n\n17\n00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.300\nso that's where we're gonna pick up\nhere in this episode, is looking at ARD.\n\n18\n00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.885\nI wanna show you how it works, really\ncook stuff, it does some neat things.\n\n19\n00:00:46.885 --> 00:00:49.887\nSo it'll be a chance to see that, and then\nwe still have some other sharing options\n\n20\n00:00:49.887 --> 00:00:52.030\nwe didn't get to,\nwe'll run through those as well.\n\n21\n00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, well ARD,\n\n22\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.080\nwe're actually kinda talking about\nit in between the episodes here.\n\n23\n00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.363\nAnd it sounds like it's the greatest\nthing since sliced bread here.\n\n24\n00:00:59.363 --> 00:01:00.419\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:03.040\n&gt;&gt; I talk highly about it.\n\n26\n00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.320\nI was telling Daniel during the break that\nthere's different tools that Apple makes\n\n27\n00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.080\navailable to help us,\nas people that have to support Mac OS, and\n\n28\n00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.110\nARD is designed for help desks.\n\n29\n00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.860\nThat if you work at a help desk somewhere,\nand you're managing and\n\n30\n00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.100\nsupporting these Macs.\n\n31\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.980\nARD gives you a way to see\nthe entire environment and\n\n32\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.330\nwork with the machines,\nupdate them, push off route, and\n\n33\n00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.540\ndo all sorts of crazy things, and\ndo it right from a centralized panel.\n\n34\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.570\nThere's another product out there\ncalled the Profile Manager.\n\n35\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.150\nIt's a part of the Server app.\n\n36\n00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.970\nAnd that one's really great for\nsystem administrators.\n\n37\n00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.770\nAnd we can create policies,\nand deploy software, and\n\n38\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.250\ndo all sorts of things there too.\n\n39\n00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.383\nBoth products are really, really powerful,\nboth are very impressive.\n\n40\n00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:43.771\nBut you gotta choose the right one for\nthe job and ARD is really designed for\n\n41\n00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:44.320\nhelp desk.\n\n42\n00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.700\nNow, before I get too far into this, let\nme talk really just briefly about price.\n\n43\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.906\nThe server app is a whopping $20.\n\n44\n00:01:50.906 --> 00:01:53.950\nYou buy it, it's tied to your iCloud\naccount or your iTunes account.\n\n45\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.269\nAnd then you can install it on your\nserver, get it up and going and\n\n46\n00:01:57.269 --> 00:02:00.670\nany Mac OS machine can now become\na server by installing that app.\n\n47\n00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.735\nARD is also available in the App Store.\n\n48\n00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:06.280\nYou go and you buy it from iCloud,\nyou install it, and now you've got it.\n\n49\n00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.480\nThe big difference being that\nARD is a whopping $80, so\n\n50\n00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.607\nit's a little bit more expensive,\nbut I will tell you it's worth $80.\n\n51\n00:02:13.607 --> 00:02:17.549\nThere're other vendors out\nthere that make products like\n\n52\n00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.171\nMicrosoft System Center\nConfiguration Manager, or\n\n53\n00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:25.851\nIBM's Tivoli that are enterprise\ngrade kind of version of ARD does.\n\n54\n00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:30.135\nAnd they cost tens of thousands even\nhundreds of thousands of dollars when\n\n55\n00:02:30.135 --> 00:02:31.874\ndeployed fully in a network.\n\n56\n00:02:31.874 --> 00:02:33.650\nWe're talking about 80 bucks here, right?\n\n57\n00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.407\nSo it's one of the more expensive apps in\nthe App Store, but it is insanely cheap\n\n58\n00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:42.599\ncompared to any of the competition\nthat's out there for what it does.\n\n59\n00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.044\n&gt;&gt; And when you say 80 bucks, is that\n80 bucks per seat, or I pay 80 bucks,\n\n60\n00:02:46.044 --> 00:02:47.901\nI get it and\nI can install it on all my Macs?\n\n61\n00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:52.507\n&gt;&gt; Well with any app in the App Store,\nit's tied to your iCloud or\n\n62\n00:02:52.507 --> 00:02:54.286\niTunes account right?\n\n63\n00:02:54.286 --> 00:02:57.340\nAnd you can install in\ntheory on five machines.\n\n64\n00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.584\nIf you have a family setup\nyou can do it that way.\n\n65\n00:02:59.584 --> 00:03:02.740\nBut if you're in a work environment you\nprobably don't have a family setup with\n\n66\n00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.450\nyour coworkers, unless it's\na family business I don't know.\n\n67\n00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.982\n&gt;&gt; It could be.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n68\n00:03:05.982 --> 00:03:09.910\nyou get the five installs really is\nkind of the way the license reads.\n\n69\n00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.701\nSo if you need more than five\nthen you gotta pay more.\n\n70\n00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:15.481\nBut five help desk people should be\nable to cover a pretty decent sized\n\n71\n00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:16.400\norganization.\n\n72\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.651\nOr five seats, and\nthen they can reach out and manage them.\n\n73\n00:03:19.651 --> 00:03:23.450\nAll right so enough about that,\nlet's actually see this turkey at work.\n\n74\n00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.510\nOn my client, so here is just a regular\nold desktop that I got fired up that is\n\n75\n00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.745\ncalled my lab client or\nsomething very creative like that.\n\n76\n00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:35.593\nAnd I'm gonna into my System Preferences,\nand in my System Preferences, I'm gonna go\n\n77\n00:03:35.593 --> 00:03:39.982\nto Sharing, and I'll see the option we\nwere talking about in the last episode,\n\n78\n00:03:39.982 --> 00:03:41.640\nwhich is Remote Management.\n\n79\n00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.882\nI'm gonna turn that on.\n\n80\n00:03:42.882 --> 00:03:48.490\nNow Remote Login is not turned on right\nnow, but a few other things were.\n\n81\n00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.990\nAnd actually, hang on, let me cancel this,\nI wanna do it one more time.\n\n82\n00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.137\nWhoops, [LAUGH] I'm trying to\ncancel please, there we go.\n\n83\n00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:58.220\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; I want you to watch this because\n\n84\n00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.722\nwhen you turn on Remote Management,\n\n85\n00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:03.090\nit kinda messes with some of\nthe other options that are up here.\n\n86\n00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.275\nThere's a lot of duplication\nbetween what ARD can do and\n\n87\n00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:08.866\nstuff that we can do\nthrough separate tools.\n\n88\n00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:13.720\nSo for example with ARD I can remotely\nview the screen of another computer.\n\n89\n00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.810\nWell I can do that with\nscreen sharing right?\n\n90\n00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.647\nWith ARD I can transfer\nfiles to a computer.\n\n91\n00:04:19.647 --> 00:04:21.580\nI can do that with file sharing.\n\n92\n00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.609\nWith ARD I can run Unix commands on\na secure shell in a remote computer.\n\n93\n00:04:25.609 --> 00:04:27.890\nI can do that with Remote Login.\n\n94\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.190\nSo if I can do that with features\nthat are already in place,\n\n95\n00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.770\nwhy the heck do I need ARD?\n\n96\n00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.089\nWell the main reason is ARD gives you\na nice GUI with a scheduling system and\n\n97\n00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:41.983\na number of other pieces that are built\ninto it that make really, really valuable.\n\n98\n00:04:41.983 --> 00:04:44.155\nBut if you don't have it,\nyou don't have to, you can go and\n\n99\n00:04:44.155 --> 00:04:47.243\nuse these individual options you just have\nto get them all configured and set up, and\n\n100\n00:04:47.243 --> 00:04:48.226\nit's a bit of a headache.\n\n101\n00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:50.668\nWith Remote Management, when I turn it on,\n\n102\n00:04:50.668 --> 00:04:54.896\nit's gonna configure those various\noptions to be ready for ARD to connect.\n\n103\n00:04:54.896 --> 00:04:58.933\nAnd so what you'll see is it will\nturn some of these things off, right?\n\n104\n00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:03.300\nWhen I turn on Remote Management,\nit takes over screen sharing.\n\n105\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.892\nSo when I check that, see how screen\nsharing just unchecked itself,\n\n106\n00:05:05.892 --> 00:05:06.571\nit turned it off.\n\n107\n00:05:06.571 --> 00:05:11.532\nCuz we're no longer gonna have the\nstandard VNC screen sharing that's part\n\n108\n00:05:11.532 --> 00:05:12.239\nof Mac OS.\n\n109\n00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:15.962\nWe're going to have the more locked down\nscreen sharing, that's a part of ARD so\n\n110\n00:05:15.962 --> 00:05:16.800\nit overrides it.\n\n111\n00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.900\nSo be aware when you turn this on,\n\n112\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.425\nit may turn off some of\nthe other options you've got on.\n\n113\n00:05:22.425 --> 00:05:24.525\nAnd then inside of remote management,\n\n114\n00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:27.652\nthere's a number of different\npieces that we can enable.\n\n115\n00:05:27.652 --> 00:05:30.050\nAnd so let me run down what\neach one of these are.\n\n116\n00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.949\nThe first one is talking about\nscreen sharing or observing.\n\n117\n00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.061\nDo I want somebody to be able to\nobserve this computer through ARD?\n\n118\n00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:41.440\nAnd if I turn it on,\nnow they can see my screen okay.\n\n119\n00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.660\nBut they can't do anything,\nthey can just see it.\n\n120\n00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.116\nThey can actually interact a little bit,\nI'll show you guys when I do it.\n\n121\n00:05:47.116 --> 00:05:50.014\nLike when you click your mouse, it\ncreates a little circle on the screen so\n\n122\n00:05:50.014 --> 00:05:53.356\nyou can actually see where somebody's\nclicking, but it doesn't actually click.\n\n123\n00:05:53.356 --> 00:05:57.740\nI can turn on Control, and\nnow they can interact with the system.\n\n124\n00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.056\nI think, Daniel, you gave an example\nin an episode earlier where,\n\n125\n00:06:00.056 --> 00:06:02.454\nif a user is telling you about a problem\nand they try and describe it, or\n\n126\n00:06:02.454 --> 00:06:04.635\nyou're trying to walk them\nthrough something over the phone.\n\n127\n00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:05.643\n&gt;&gt; It's painful.\n\n128\n00:06:05.643 --> 00:06:07.540\n&gt;&gt; It can be nightmarish sometimes.\n\n129\n00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.560\nSo, if you can just pull up\ntheir screen and actually do it,\n\n130\n00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.270\nit's a heck of a lot faster sometimes.\n\n131\n00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.600\nI know the whole teach a man to fish,\nor give a man a fish feed him for a day.\n\n132\n00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.040\n&gt;&gt; Teach a man to fish,\nfeed him for his life.\n\n133\n00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.620\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n134\n00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.559\nSo we gotta have our proper platitudes for\nrunning a help desk.\n\n135\n00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:23.101\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n136\n00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:24.929\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, at the end of the day sometimes\n\n137\n00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:26.285\nyou just have to do things.\n\n138\n00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:28.369\n[LAUGH] Do them and get them moved on.\n\n139\n00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:31.530\nYou'lll see this show when\nbeing observed option.\n\n140\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:32.890\nThat one you may or may not want right.\n\n141\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.920\nIf this is a school And you want teachers\nto be able to view the students'\n\n142\n00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.760\ndesktops and not have them know about it,\nright, spying and secrecy.\n\n143\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.844\nThen you want this off.\n\n144\n00:06:41.844 --> 00:06:44.191\nIf it's turned on, they'll actually\nget a little notification,\n\n145\n00:06:44.191 --> 00:06:45.810\nthey'll know when they're being observed.\n\n146\n00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.580\nAnd for a normal company,\nwe'll have that turned on.\n\n147\n00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.459\nSo they'll know when the help\ndesk is connected, and\n\n148\n00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:51.269\nthey'll know when the help\ndesk is disconnected.\n\n149\n00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:53.797\n&gt;&gt; We ran into that, didn't we, Don?\n\n150\n00:06:53.797 --> 00:06:57.040\nDon and I used to work together,\n[COUGH] At an insurance company.\n\n151\n00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.680\nAnd people were like,\nI can view other people's screens?\n\n152\n00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.950\nI'm going to do that.\n\n153\n00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.123\nAnd then we had to go, okay well,\nwe got to put the kibosh on that.\n\n154\n00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:04.892\n&gt;&gt; If you do that again you are fired.\n\n155\n00:07:04.892 --> 00:07:05.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n156\n00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.631\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yeah, with great power comes\n\n157\n00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:10.412\ngreat responsibility,-\n&gt;&gt; It does in fact.\n\n158\n00:07:10.412 --> 00:07:12.590\n&gt;&gt; And so\nwe do have to be careful with that.\n\n159\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.920\nAll right, we have some other\noptions like generate reports.\n\n160\n00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.460\nGenerate reports is a neat one.\n\n161\n00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.460\nYou can have your Macs do a catalog\nof what their hardware is,\n\n162\n00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.650\nhow much memory, how much CPU,\nhow much hard drive space they're using,\n\n163\n00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.090\nwhat apps they have installed.\n\n164\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.262\nAnd they can send it all back to ARD.\n\n165\n00:07:28.262 --> 00:07:28.962\n&gt;&gt; That's very nice.\n\n166\n00:07:28.962 --> 00:07:32.640\n&gt;&gt; And so I can go in there and\nquickly pull up, maybe I wanna know hey,\n\n167\n00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.112\nMac OS Sierra just came out, and they\ndropped support for the 2008 MacBook or\n\n168\n00:07:37.112 --> 00:07:38.200\nsomething.\n\n169\n00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.124\nHow many of those 2008\nMacBooks do I have out there?\n\n170\n00:07:40.124 --> 00:07:42.620\nI can go into the reports and\nI can find out and I can pull up a list.\n\n171\n00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.200\nSo you can start to see that information,\nso I'll turn on that Generate reports.\n\n172\n00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.011\nOpen and quit applications.\n\n173\n00:07:48.011 --> 00:07:51.765\nFrom inside of ARD we can actually\nterminate applications that are running,\n\n174\n00:07:51.765 --> 00:07:55.361\nor we can launch applications, and\nthis is done without screen sharing.\n\n175\n00:07:55.361 --> 00:07:58.234\nSo I'm might want to run a script in\nthe background on somebody's system,\n\n176\n00:07:58.234 --> 00:08:00.515\nmaybe they install some software or\nconfigure something,\n\n177\n00:08:00.515 --> 00:08:02.540\nI can do that, and\nthey do not even know what happen.\n\n178\n00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.990\nit's all in the background seamless to the\nend user, and you can get in there, and\n\n179\n00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.100\ndo whatever it is you need to do.\n\n180\n00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.370\nChange settings,\nwe'll go through modified preferences and\n\n181\n00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.060\nsettings on the system\nall through the variety.\n\n182\n00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.250\nDelete and replace items, this is really\ntalking about file shares, right?\n\n183\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.690\nThis is really useful like one,\nupdate applications.\n\n184\n00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.380\nI can delete the old\nversion of an application,\n\n185\n00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.370\nand add in the new version\nof an application.\n\n186\n00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.850\nYou can move files around, you can\ndo whatever you need based on that.\n\n187\n00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.950\nStart text chat or send messages.\n\n188\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.290\nIf you're on the phone with somebody,\nyou can be walking them through,\n\n189\n00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.740\nseeing their screen and that's nice.\n\n190\n00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.300\nBut you'll also have a text functionality,\n\n191\n00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.870\nwhere you can communicate\nvia a little chat window.\n\n192\n00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.310\nWe can restart and\nshutdown computers, if we need to.\n\n193\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.446\nMaybe it's, we're about to go on to the\nholiday break, and so I just wanna go and\n\n194\n00:08:42.446 --> 00:08:44.580\nshutdown, all the computers\non the network.\n\n195\n00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.980\nSo we can go through and do that.\n\n196\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.670\nJust make sure we don't waste\nelectricity over the holidays.\n\n197\n00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.510\nAnd then, Copy items.\n\n198\n00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.806\nThat's really just like\ntransferring items,\n\n199\n00:08:51.806 --> 00:08:54.740\nright, we can copy files, bring them back\nand forth, whatever is that we need.\n\n200\n00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.148\n&gt;&gt; It's actually a really great feature,\ncuz there's nothing worse that going,\n\n201\n00:08:58.148 --> 00:09:00.574\nlet me just copy and\npaste from your screen onto my computer.\n\n202\n00:09:00.574 --> 00:09:02.811\nAnd you're like, I can't do that.\n\n203\n00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:04.143\nBut if you click this, you can do that.\n\n204\n00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:06.904\nAnd you say, I'm just copying\nthis swath of information, and\n\n205\n00:09:06.904 --> 00:09:09.420\nnow I have a file of my own\nwith that same information.\n\n206\n00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.540\n&gt;&gt; Well, the other nice part of this is,\nit's part of ARD, so\n\n207\n00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.010\nit's embedded in the remote management.\n\n208\n00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.105\nWe're not turning on file sharing, right?\n\n209\n00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:15.664\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n210\n00:09:15.664 --> 00:09:17.580\n&gt;&gt; So it's not like a shared folder\nsomebody could potentially get at.\n\n211\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.686\nThis is all done through\nthe remote management.\n\n212\n00:09:18.686 --> 00:09:22.682\nAll right, now when all of that is\nturned on, now the system is set up for\n\n213\n00:09:22.682 --> 00:09:25.580\nremote management, right,\nand I can connect in.\n\n214\n00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.150\nWhile notice the Allow access,\nAllow access to that to all users.\n\n215\n00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:34.220\nSo anybody who has a user account on\nthis computer, could fire up ARD and\n\n216\n00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.170\nconnect to it, and start doing all\nthe various things we just enabled.\n\n217\n00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.260\nThat includes just regular users, right?\n\n218\n00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.337\nIf I go back to my user list,\nand I take a look at my users,\n\n219\n00:09:42.337 --> 00:09:45.300\nI've got this HelpDesk Account\nas an admin, right?\n\n220\n00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.616\nBut I've got Samantha Jones,\nwho's a Managed user.\n\n221\n00:09:48.616 --> 00:09:52.608\nRonnie, Sharing Only, he wont be\nable to connect, but Samantha is.\n\n222\n00:09:52.608 --> 00:09:55.832\nShe's a managed user, she would be\nable to connect to Ronnie that stuff,\n\n223\n00:09:55.832 --> 00:09:58.077\neven though shes got\nparental controls turned on.\n\n224\n00:09:58.077 --> 00:09:59.435\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a kids account.\n\n225\n00:09:59.435 --> 00:10:01.281\nShe would be able to connect\nto it with the ARD, right?\n\n226\n00:10:01.281 --> 00:10:02.616\nI'ts a dummy account,\nshes in the staff group.\n\n227\n00:10:02.616 --> 00:10:05.839\nSo I might wanna tweak that a little bit,\nand change it so\n\n228\n00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:10.300\ninstead of saying all users,\nI might wanna choose, Only these users.\n\n229\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.120\nAnd what I normally do is pick\na particular user account\n\n230\n00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.800\nto use just for ARD.\n\n231\n00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.080\nSo we can set that up, and\nI created this HelpDesk account,\n\n232\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.360\ncuz that's what I'm gonna use.\n\n233\n00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.560\nSo we'll turn that on.\n\n234\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.730\nAnd you can see where you can pick and\n\n235\n00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.080\nchoose exactly what that\nspecific user is allowed to do.\n\n236\n00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.480\nSo I can just run down this list, and\n\n237\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.687\ncheck off everything,\nthat I want them to be able to do.\n\n238\n00:10:28.687 --> 00:10:32.393\nAnd that's nice because, different users\ncan have different permissions, and\n\n239\n00:10:32.393 --> 00:10:33.420\nwe can get that setup.\n\n240\n00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.000\nAll right, now once that's done,\nthis machine is now setup for\n\n241\n00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.160\nremote management.\n\n242\n00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.170\nIt's not actually sharing anything.\n\n243\n00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.080\nIt's waiting for us to connect to it,\nand then through ARD,\n\n244\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.230\nwe can do all sorts of fun stuff.\n\n245\n00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:49.040\nSo let me jump over to my laptop,\nand I've got\n\n246\n00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.790\nApple remote desktop installed, and so\nI'm gonna fire up Apple remote desktop.\n\n247\n00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.620\nAnd when you launch it, one of\nthe first things you'll notice is that,\n\n248\n00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.260\nit starts on a scanner, and\nit's finding machines on the network.\n\n249\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.680\nIt is looking out there to find machines.\n\n250\n00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.210\nAnd mine has actually\nfound three machines.\n\n251\n00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:06.950\nTechnically, it's found two,\nI found one twice.\n\n252\n00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.040\nThe scanner is really important.\n\n253\n00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.470\nIt's scanning your network, because you\nmay add computers in the future, and\n\n254\n00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:14.820\nwe need to get those added in here.\n\n255\n00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.258\nSo I'm just looking at\ncomputers that it's found.\n\n256\n00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:20.240\nAnd when it scans, it's got a number\nof different ways that it can scan.\n\n257\n00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.680\nThe default is Bonjour.\n\n258\n00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.680\nIf we're looking for other Macs,\nwe'll find them using Bonjour.\n\n259\n00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.926\nThe only problem with Bonjour is that,\n\n260\n00:11:25.926 --> 00:11:27.642\nit doesn't pass through routers very well,\nright?\n\n261\n00:11:27.642 --> 00:11:30.900\nI've got multiple network adapters,\nso I'm seeing two networks here.\n\n262\n00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.520\nBut normally, you'll only see one network,\nand it won't pass through the router.\n\n263\n00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.360\nSo if you're trying to find systems\nthat are on a different network,\n\n264\n00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.410\nyou can choose a network range or\na network address.\n\n265\n00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.280\nAnd you can specify addresses\nin a separate network.\n\n266\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.170\nAnd that will pass through a router,\nit's not using Bonjour anymore, and\n\n267\n00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.620\nyou can find and manage those systems.\n\n268\n00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.020\nYou can also do a file import.\n\n269\n00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.250\nYou might have a CSV file,\n\n270\n00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.320\na comma separated values text file,\nthat lists all your computers and\n\n271\n00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.750\ntheir IP addresses, and a user\naccount to be able to connect to them.\n\n272\n00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.510\nAnd you can import that in here,\nif you have thousands and\n\n273\n00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.129\nthousands of machines, that's\nusually faster than doing discovery.\n\n274\n00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.401\nWe can define a task server.\n\n275\n00:12:05.401 --> 00:12:09.181\nI don't wanna go too crazy in\ndetail in this one, but in the ARD,\n\n276\n00:12:09.181 --> 00:12:11.072\nit's actually got two pieces.\n\n277\n00:12:11.072 --> 00:12:13.018\nThere's the GUI that I'm in right now, and\n\n278\n00:12:13.018 --> 00:12:16.280\non the back end is a task server\nthat's actually doing the work.\n\n279\n00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.200\nWell, in a large network, I may have\nfive or six different task servers.\n\n280\n00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.720\nAnd then one GUI that connects\nto all those task servers.\n\n281\n00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.630\nSo, I can discover clients by connecting\nto the different task servers, and\n\n282\n00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.860\nI'll see any client that's attached to\nthem, so that's what I was talking about.\n\n283\n00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.600\nIf you have less than 1,000 computers,\nyou'll usually just do one instance,\n\n284\n00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.370\nwhich is what I've done.\n\n285\n00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.680\nI've just installed ARD here,\nso I've got the GUI and\n\n286\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.200\nthe task server all running together,\nthat's actually the default.\n\n287\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.200\nAnd then a Directory Server.\n\n288\n00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.950\nI can connect to a Microsoft Active\nDirectory or an Apple Open Directory,\n\n289\n00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.420\nand query a list of all the clients\nright out of the directory.\n\n290\n00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.990\nSo these are all different ways\nthat we can find the computers\n\n291\n00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.160\nthat are out there on the network.\n\n292\n00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.305\nAll right, now I can see like,\nMac Mini Studio 2.\n\n293\n00:12:56.305 --> 00:12:57.385\nWe're in studio four.\n\n294\n00:12:57.385 --> 00:13:00.550\nSo, I guess somebody must\nof turned it on over there.\n\n295\n00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.964\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You see this by accident a lot.\n\n296\n00:13:01.964 --> 00:13:06.145\nPeople will see that remote management,\nand mistake what it means.\n\n297\n00:13:06.145 --> 00:13:07.815\nThey won't realize that it's ARD and\nthey'll turn it on,\n\n298\n00:13:07.815 --> 00:13:10.715\nand then they realize it doesn't work and\nthey go turn other things on, and\n\n299\n00:13:10.715 --> 00:13:11.655\nthey never turn this one off.\n\n300\n00:13:11.655 --> 00:13:14.291\nSo, somebody must have turned that on,\non Mac Mini Studio 2.\n\n301\n00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:18.100\nBut, I do see my LAB-CLIENT,\nand I'm picking up twice.\n\n302\n00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.390\nBecause of the different\nprotocols that it's running.\n\n303\n00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.570\nI'm seeing it via more than one protocol.\n\n304\n00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.980\nNotice the second protocol,\nhow it's kinda grayed out, and\n\n305\n00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:29.930\nthere's no options tied to it, I can't use\nthat one, that'll probably be like SMB.\n\n306\n00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.710\nBut via Bonjour, we're able to find it,\nand it's communicating with it, and\n\n307\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.993\nI can see that it's got ARD Version 3.8.5.\n\n308\n00:13:36.993 --> 00:13:38.991\nOkay, now 3.8.5.\n\n309\n00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:41.775\nBut this Mac Mini down here is 3.9.2.\n\n310\n00:13:41.775 --> 00:13:44.767\nIt's got a newer one, that means,\nI've got outstanding updates.\n\n311\n00:13:44.767 --> 00:13:48.557\nI need to do some updates on that client,\nwhich we can force along via ARD,\n\n312\n00:13:48.557 --> 00:13:50.230\nonce this is all set up.\n\n313\n00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.340\nOr we can just go and\nmanually update it, if we want.\n\n314\n00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.730\nBut it'll work, I can connect to it, too.\n\n315\n00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:55.610\nNow to connect to it and\n\n316\n00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.920\nwork with it, you don't do it here from\nthe discovery screen, from the scanner.\n\n317\n00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.110\nWhat we need to do are create lists.\n\n318\n00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.370\nLists are groupings of computers.\n\n319\n00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.160\nAnd you have one list by default,\nthis All Computers, right?\n\n320\n00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.850\nThat's gonna be, guess what?\n\n321\n00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.160\nAll your computers, right?\n\n322\n00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.290\nSo, at a minimum, in your scanner,\nyou are gonna take a client like this, and\n\n323\n00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.980\nyou'll just drag and\ndrop it onto all computers.\n\n324\n00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.520\nNow when you do that,\nit's gonna ask you for\n\n325\n00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.260\na valid administrative\naccount on that client.\n\n326\n00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.790\nAnd so I need to provide\nan account that has permission,\n\n327\n00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.520\nI said administrative account.\n\n328\n00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:30.430\nIt's anybody who's in that list of people\nthat we approve for remote management.\n\n329\n00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.150\nIt may not be an administrator,\nit's just somebody that we've approved.\n\n330\n00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.288\nSo I have an account called HelpDesk,\nand so that's what I'm gonna provide.\n\n331\n00:14:37.396 --> 00:14:41.060\nAnd so we'll go ahead and add that,\nand it's gonna get it connected in.\n\n332\n00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.280\nAnd when it's connected, you'll know it,\n\n333\n00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.770\ncuz it gets this little orb that appears\nbeside it, and so I know it's connected.\n\n334\n00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.136\nThese other guys don't have orbs,\nso I know they're not connected.\n\n335\n00:14:48.136 --> 00:14:52.960\nCan't mess with a client that's\nnot connected and managed.\n\n336\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.220\nAnd if I go under All Computers,\nI can see it right there.\n\n337\n00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.360\nNow in real life,\nif you have 1,000 computers, you're\n\n338\n00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.720\nprobably gonna need to divide them up into\ncategories, so let me give you an example.\n\n339\n00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.820\nLet's say that you are managing\nthe Mac network for your school.\n\n340\n00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.670\nAnd at your school,\n\n341\n00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.760\nyou're need to think about how\nyou're gonna manage those computers.\n\n342\n00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.450\nYou may have software that you\nneed to push out just to teachers.\n\n343\n00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.290\nAnd you may have other software that\nyou wanna push out just to students.\n\n344\n00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.080\nAnd you may have other software that you\nwanna push out to everything, right?\n\n345\n00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.526\nWell, for everything,\nI can use all computers.\n\n346\n00:15:19.526 --> 00:15:21.660\nI've already got that taken care of.\n\n347\n00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:26.630\nBut for teachers and students,\nI can go up here to my File menu.\n\n348\n00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.680\nAnd choose New List or Command+N,\nis what I normally hit, it's faster.\n\n349\n00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.770\nBut New List, and you can create a new\nlist, and you can give it a name.\n\n350\n00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:37.152\nSo I'll create Teachers, and\nthen Students, all right?\n\n351\n00:15:37.152 --> 00:15:41.379\nI might have software that I\nwant to push out to laptops.\n\n352\n00:15:41.379 --> 00:15:44.699\nAnd I might have software that\nI wanna push out to desktops.\n\n353\n00:15:44.699 --> 00:15:46.360\nSo I can create those lists also.\n\n354\n00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:46.985\nSo Laptops and Desktops.\nAnd\n\n355\n00:15:46.985 --> 00:15:51.866\nthen when I do Is I take\ncomputers like LAB-CLIENT01, and\n\n356\n00:15:51.866 --> 00:15:56.380\nI could just drag and\ndrop it into the appropriate list.\n\n357\n00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.540\nSo LAB-CLIENT01, that might be a student\ncomputer, so I'll put it down to students.\n\n358\n00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.442\nAnd it might be a desktop, and so\nI can drag it and put it on desktops.\n\n359\n00:16:04.442 --> 00:16:07.460\nAs so now, when I look at students or\ndesktops, there it is.\n\n360\n00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.040\nIf I look at laptops, its not there.\n\n361\n00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.850\nIf I look at teachers, its not there.\n\n362\n00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:13.210\nAnd now, I can start to manage\nthese computers based on that.\n\n363\n00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:18.040\nNow, the reason I point that out\nis that ARD can perform an action,\n\n364\n00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.290\nnot just once but hundreds,\neven thousands of times.\n\n365\n00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.300\nI might have 1,000 laptops.\n\n366\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.060\nI can come in here and say I want to\ndeploy some software to all my laptops.\n\n367\n00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.250\nI could deploy it to that list, and\n\n368\n00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.300\nevery one of those thousand\ncomputers will get that software.\n\n369\n00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.790\nThat's the real power of ARD,\nis that we can do changes in bulk, right?\n\n370\n00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:39.159\nWe can do microscopic changes,\nchanges on one machine.\n\n371\n00:16:39.159 --> 00:16:41.527\nOr we can change our entire environment.\n\n372\n00:16:41.527 --> 00:16:44.960\nIt's up to us, and creating these\nlists is a key part of that.\n\n373\n00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.425\nAll right, well, what are some\nof the things that we can do?\n\n374\n00:16:47.425 --> 00:16:50.171\nWhen you highlight a computer, up top\nyou will see a lot of the stuff that we\n\n375\n00:16:50.171 --> 00:16:52.230\ncan do, things that we\nalready talked about, right?\n\n376\n00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.560\nLike I can observe that machine.\n\n377\n00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.760\nThe observe button look like binoculars.\n\n378\n00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.320\nAnd when I click it, there it is,\nI'm looking at that client right now.\n\n379\n00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:05.130\nI'm still on my laptop, but\nI'm seeing that client.\n\n380\n00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.730\nAnd I can adjust the quality up here,\nup at the top.\n\n381\n00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.620\nWe've got this little quality slider.\n\n382\n00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:14.570\nIf you're local like I am, you can\ngo high quality and it looks great.\n\n383\n00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:18.470\nBut if you're over an Internet connection,\nit can start stuttering,\n\n384\n00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.833\nrunning kind of slow or whatever, so\nyou can actually lower the image quality.\n\n385\n00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:25.280\nAnd see how super-crummy that looks?\n\n386\n00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.230\nBut that's a good thing.\n\n387\n00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.920\n&gt;&gt; It's better than nothing when it comes\nto a crappy connection, though, right?\n\n388\n00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's going to make it fast, right?\n\n389\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.160\nAnd so, as I'm helping this user and going\nthrough and launching applications, things\n\n390\n00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.130\nlike that, it's gonna run a heck of a lot\nfaster, because the quality is so low.\n\n391\n00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.930\nBut I'm gonna bump it back up.\n\n392\n00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:41.560\nThere we go.\n\n393\n00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.620\nI'm not even on the highest setting and\nthat actually looks really good.\n\n394\n00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.580\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; All right, now when I connect,\n\n395\n00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.350\nI am in Observe Only mode.\n\n396\n00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.967\n&gt;&gt; So you're not making any,\nyou can't click on things and, well,\n\n397\n00:17:50.967 --> 00:17:53.320\nat least not out of the gate,\nnot while in Observe Mode.\n\n398\n00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.930\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\nAnd if you watch, here let me show you.\n\n399\n00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.000\nI'm gonna click down here,\nlike if I try and launch Safari, right?\n\n400\n00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.290\nDo you see what's happening there?\n\n401\n00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.250\nSee that little circle that appears?\n\n402\n00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.940\nThe circle appears briefly, if I click.\n\n403\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.190\nBut if I hold it down,\nthe circle actually stays up, okay?\n\n404\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.750\nNow, the other end is seeing this also.\n\n405\n00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.300\nAnd that's really handy, cuz you can say,\n\n406\n00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.080\nall right,\nI need you to click on Macintosh HD.\n\n407\n00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.656\nAnd you can take your little circle and\npoint it up there like that, and\n\n408\n00:18:18.656 --> 00:18:22.060\nnow they have a visual cues that says,\nokay, I need to click on Macintosh HD.\n\n409\n00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.097\nI can't actually click it,\n\n410\n00:18:23.097 --> 00:18:25.620\nI can click all I want there\nit doesn't do anything, right?\n\n411\n00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.190\nBut I'm able to see it, and\nthey can see the pointers.\n\n412\n00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.230\nI'm steering them in\nthe right direction and\n\n413\n00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.660\ndrawing their eyes to\nwhere it needs to be.\n\n414\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.670\nThat's what the circle does, right?\n\n415\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.650\n&gt;&gt; So they're just,\nI'm sorry, [COUGH] excuse me.\n\n416\n00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.030\nThey're just seeing that weird\nlittle highlighting thing, and\n\n417\n00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.820\ntheir mouse continues\nto operate as normal?\n\n418\n00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.110\n&gt;&gt; Right, their mouse is\ncompletely independent, right?\n\n419\n00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:49.815\nUntil [LAUGH] if you look up here,\nwe've got more options, right?\n\n420\n00:18:49.815 --> 00:18:51.512\nI'm in Observe mode, but\n\n421\n00:18:51.512 --> 00:18:55.920\nright beside that we've got\nShared Control and Absolute Control.\n\n422\n00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.540\nShared control means we\nboth control the mouse.\n\n423\n00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.990\nI can start moving the mouse around and\nclicking on things, and they can too, and\n\n424\n00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.060\nwe can fight each other for it.\n\n425\n00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.490\nSo you can say take your hands\noff the mouse for a second,\n\n426\n00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:07.400\nlet me show you how to do this.\n\n427\n00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.600\nBut they can still take control back,\nright?\n\n428\n00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.850\nAnd that's what that one does, and\n\n429\n00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:15.870\nwhen I click on it, now I can go in,\nand I can click on the desktop.\n\n430\n00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.770\nI can open up Macintosh HD.\n\n431\n00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.900\nNow I'm actually interacting with it,\nright?\n\n432\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.050\nAnd if I go Absolute Control,\nwell, I can interact with it, and\n\n433\n00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.050\ntheir local mouse and\nkeyboard no longer works, right?\n\n434\n00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:30.531\nIf they wanna disconnect me, they gotta\nyank the network cable out, right?\n\n435\n00:19:30.531 --> 00:19:32.616\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's kinda got it tied up.\n\n436\n00:19:32.616 --> 00:19:36.300\nIn fact, if I jump over and take\na look here, here I am on that client.\n\n437\n00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:41.250\nAnd if I try and click on anything,\nI'm trying to click, it's not working.\n\n438\n00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.450\nEven the mouse over hints aren't working.\n\n439\n00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:48.390\nIt's completely taken over, and\nthey can't do anything, right?\n\n440\n00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.770\nUntil we switch this back to\nShared Control or Disconnect.\n\n441\n00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.270\nAll right, so that's a pretty cool\nfeature to have to be able to help and\n\n442\n00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.090\nsupport people.\n\n443\n00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:00.720\nAnd at a minimum, that's a feature that's\nreally beneficial for help desk, right?\n\n444\n00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.600\nTo be able to work with their users.\n\n445\n00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.430\nBut going beyond that,\nwe can do a lot more, right?\n\n446\n00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.020\nSo we had that Observe Control.\n\n447\n00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.140\nYou've got curtain.\n\n448\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.660\nI didn't, I should have shown the curtain.\n\n449\n00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.070\n&gt;&gt; The curtain.\n&gt;&gt; With curtain, I can pull up a machine.\n\n450\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:16.130\nI can start to control,\nI'm gonna go Absolute Control, right?\n\n451\n00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.550\nAnd maybe I need to do something that\nrequires administrative access, and\n\n452\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.980\nI don't want them to see what I'm typing,\nright?\n\n453\n00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.020\nSo I can turn on the curtain, right?\n\n454\n00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:32.500\nAnd it's gonna display a message,\nsystem maintenance is ongoing.\n\n455\n00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.450\nOr something like that, right?\n\n456\n00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.290\nAnd I still see the screen.\n\n457\n00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.120\nAnd I can get in here and\n\n458\n00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.530\nI can open up Macintosh HD/ But if I go\nover here, this is what the user sees.\n\n459\n00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.260\nA great big padlock saying\nsystem maintenance is ongoing,\n\n460\n00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.880\nscreen is locked by Done Pezet.\n\n461\n00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.350\nAnd now, not only can they\nnot use the computer, but\n\n462\n00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.560\nthey cannot see what's going on.\n\n463\n00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.560\nAnd that's really handy cuz sometimes you\nmight need to pull up a config file and\n\n464\n00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.993\ntype in a password or\naccess a server they shouldn't know about.\n\n465\n00:20:57.993 --> 00:21:01.070\nThis is a way that we can do that without\nthem actually seeing what's going on.\n\n466\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:05.851\nThat's the curtain, and you can take that\ncurtain away and they are right back in.\n\n467\n00:21:05.851 --> 00:21:08.190\nSo that's kind of\nthe advantage there of that.\n\n468\n00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.450\nYou can take screenshots and\nother basic things.\n\n469\n00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:13.330\nBut that's kind of the functionality\nof that remote visibility.\n\n470\n00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.540\nSome of the other things we can do.\n\n471\n00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.880\nWe can copy files, right?\n\n472\n00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.320\nIf I click that copy button,\nI can choose items to copy.\n\n473\n00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.520\nAnd I can copy from their computer\nto mine or the other way around,\n\n474\n00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.200\nfrom mine to theirs.\n\n475\n00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.860\nAnd one of the best instances\nof how I like to use that is\n\n476\n00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.670\ninstalling an application, right?\n\n477\n00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:33.540\nSo let's say, for example,\nthat a user calls me and they're like,\n\n478\n00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:37.145\nDon, I gotta transfer a file and\nthey're telling me I have to use SFTP.\n\n479\n00:21:37.145 --> 00:21:39.373\nDoes a Mac's board have SFTP?\n\n480\n00:21:39.373 --> 00:21:40.985\nAnd I'll say, yeah, yeah,\nit supports it, no big deal.\n\n481\n00:21:40.985 --> 00:21:44.978\nAnd they'll say, yeah, but I don't\nknow how to use it, it's really hard.\n\n482\n00:21:44.978 --> 00:21:46.770\nI'll say, well, yeah, it is really hard,\n\n483\n00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:51.520\nso why don't we load act\nCyberduck on your system right?\n\n484\n00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.130\nCyberduck is a free SFTP client.\n\n485\n00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:57.100\nIt actually does a number\nof different protocols.\n\n486\n00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.110\nBut SFTP works great on a Mac.\n\n487\n00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.290\nAnd so, I'm gonna go and\ndownload Cyberduck and install it.\n\n488\n00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:06.920\nNow, if I offer for them to do it,\nthey might not be administrators.\n\n489\n00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.900\nThey might not be allowed\nto install the app.\n\n490\n00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.840\nAnd if they do install it and they go\nto launch it, gatekeeper might stop\n\n491\n00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.990\nit from running cuz it was downloaded from\nthe Internet and all that stuff, right?\n\n492\n00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.339\nWell, as an administrator,\nI can download CyberDuck.\n\n493\n00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.930\nAnd let me just take it, and\nI believe it downloads a DMG, doesn't it?\n\n494\n00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.470\nLet's find out.\n\n495\n00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.842\nNope, actually downloaded\nstraight up the application.\n\n496\n00:22:27.842 --> 00:22:29.670\nThat's convenient.\n\n497\n00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.920\nSo I have downloaded it.\n\n498\n00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.140\nAnd I've got it here on my laptop, right?\n\n499\n00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.450\nBut what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ninstall CyberDuck on their machine.\n\n500\n00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.250\nAnd I'm gonna do through ARD.\n\n501\n00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:45.344\nSo if they need to access this file.\n\n502\n00:22:45.344 --> 00:22:48.417\nLet me just find it real quick,\nburied on my disk.\n\n503\n00:22:48.417 --> 00:22:50.390\nI'm gonna put this on my desktop so\nI can find it easier.\n\n504\n00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:53.610\nThere we go.\nAll right, so\n\n505\n00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.660\nI'm just going to copy that\nCyberDuck on my desktop, right?\n\n506\n00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:00.780\nIf I jump over the client,\nlet me get out of all this stuff.\n\n507\n00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.510\nSo here I am on the client, and\nI'm just going to do a quick search for\n\n508\n00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.630\nCyberduck, and it's not installed.\n\n509\n00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.840\nThe only link that I'm finding is\na link to the App Store, right?\n\n510\n00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.000\nSo they can go to the App Store and\ninstall it because it's there.\n\n511\n00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.120\nIf I go on my hard drive and\ngo into applications,\n\n512\n00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.510\nwe can just double-check here.\n\n513\n00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.250\nNo Cyberduck, right?\n\n514\n00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.620\nBut I can jump over to ARD.\n\n515\n00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.710\nAnd in ARD, I can choose that client or\nI could even choose one of my lists and\n\n516\n00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:30.250\nsay I want to roll this out to all of\nmy desktops or to all of my students.\n\n517\n00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.920\nAnd I can choose Copy, and\nI can choose the items I want to copy.\n\n518\n00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.889\nAnd so, I'm gonna come in here and\nadd, and\n\n519\n00:23:36.889 --> 00:23:39.920\nI'm gonna add in Cyberduck right there.\n\n520\n00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.790\nSo that's what I want to copy.\n\n521\n00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.120\nAnd then I can specify what I want to do.\n\n522\n00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:43.938\nWhere do I want to copy it to?\n\n523\n00:23:43.938 --> 00:23:47.610\nI wanna copy this to\nthe applications folder.\n\n524\n00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:48.880\nI'm installing an application.\n\n525\n00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.670\nIf the item already exists,\nWhat will I do?\n\n526\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.827\nWell, I can replace it\nif it's already there.\n\n527\n00:23:54.827 --> 00:23:57.990\nBut that might be a problem, maybe\nthey've installed the App store version.\n\n528\n00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:00.670\nI don't wanna override that with the one\nI just downloaded from the web and\n\n529\n00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:01.190\nI prefer that.\n\n530\n00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.620\nSo, you could choose to ask or\nnot do anything.\n\n531\n00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.340\nYou could say,\n\n532\n00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.680\nreplace if the existing item is older, if\nthis is a newer version, let's replace it.\n\n533\n00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.370\nYou could rename the existing item, or\nrename this one that we're copying over,\n\n534\n00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.870\nso we can make sure that we preserve it.\n\n535\n00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:18.024\nI'm gonna choose to replace,\nif the existing item is older,\n\n536\n00:24:18.024 --> 00:24:20.581\notherwise we'll just gonna copy in,\nall right.\n\n537\n00:24:20.581 --> 00:24:24.179\nWe can change our permission if we\nneed to, I'm gonna leave those alone.\n\n538\n00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:27.529\nAnd then, if a problem occurs\nwe can dead stop the operation.\n\n539\n00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:29.102\nBut if you're deploying\nto a thousand machines,\n\n540\n00:24:29.102 --> 00:24:30.345\nyou normally just wanted to continue.\n\n541\n00:24:30.345 --> 00:24:33.650\nGo ahead and try install on all thousand,\nand maybe it failed on some.\n\n542\n00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.290\nWe can go back and\nfix those later, all right.\n\n543\n00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.580\nWe can have it launch\nafter it copies over.\n\n544\n00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.590\nSo you're on the phone with them, and\nthey're like, we really need cyberduck.\n\n545\n00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:41.390\nOkay, give me just a second.\n\n546\n00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:42.420\nI'm going to deploy it.\n\n547\n00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.450\nAll right, Cyberduck should\nbe launching on your screen.\n\n548\n00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.080\nAnd it will pop up, and\nnow they're in it, right.\n\n549\n00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:47.850\n&gt;&gt; That's kinda cool [LAUGH].\n\n550\n00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.270\n&gt;&gt; How great an experience is that, right?\n\n551\n00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.600\nYou can also limit the bandwidth.\n\n552\n00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.770\nIf you're pushing out huge amounts of\nsoftware, you can restrict that back.\n\n553\n00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.160\nAnd then we can see the computers\nthat I have chosen, and\n\n554\n00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.090\nwhether they're available or not,\nbecause machines might be offline.\n\n555\n00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.770\nIf I can't see them,\nI can't roll the software out to it.\n\n556\n00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:06.630\nNow when I go to deploy it,\nI've got two options.\n\n557\n00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:09.980\nI can hit Copy, and it's gonna go\nahead and deploy right now, or\n\n558\n00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.410\nI can schedule it.\n\n559\n00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:13.200\nMaybe I wanna roll this\nout at 1 AM tonight, so\n\n560\n00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.460\nit doesn't affect the network and\npeople's machines.\n\n561\n00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.810\nI can schedule it to roll out that way,\nright?\n\n562\n00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.090\nOr I can just hit Copy,\nwhich is what I'm going to do.\n\n563\n00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:24.460\nNow, if you schedule it, it's gonna go\ndown here under your task server, right?\n\n564\n00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.690\nThe task server is listing things\nthat are scheduled for later.\n\n565\n00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:31.520\nActive tasks are tasks that are running\nright now, and then when the task is done,\n\n566\n00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.970\nit moves down to history.\n\n567\n00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:36.080\nSo if I schedule a task, it's actually\ngonna go through all three of these.\n\n568\n00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.260\nIt'll go to task server\nwhile it's waiting.\n\n569\n00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.930\nGo to Active Tasks,\nwhile it's running, and\n\n570\n00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.800\nthen come down to History when it's done.\n\n571\n00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.350\nBecause I just chose the copy button and\n\n572\n00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:47.200\ndidn't schedule it, it went straight to\nActive Tasks, and then down to History.\n\n573\n00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.110\nThe reason I point that out,\n\n574\n00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.880\nis you'll wanna come to History to\nsee whether it succeeded or not.\n\n575\n00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.780\nRight, if it failed we'll see it here,\nwe can read why.\n\n576\n00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:59.020\nIt might have succeeded on 990\nmachines and failed on 10.\n\n577\n00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.365\nAnd so I can sort by task status and\nfind the ones that failed.\n\n578\n00:26:03.365 --> 00:26:07.560\nAnd we can take the ones that failed and\ngo in and create a custom list with them.\n\n579\n00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.431\nAnd redeploy, or try and solve what\nthat problem is and work that out.\n\n580\n00:26:11.431 --> 00:26:14.959\nOkay, but now that it's done,\nwhen I go back over to that client,\n\n581\n00:26:14.959 --> 00:26:17.617\nthis client didn't have\nCyberduck a minute ago.\n\n582\n00:26:17.617 --> 00:26:22.520\nIf I go here into Applications, I can\nsee that it does have Cyberduck, right?\n\n583\n00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.100\nEven better, when I run Cyberduck,\nwatch what happens.\n\n584\n00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.186\nIt's, there we go.\n\n585\n00:26:29.186 --> 00:26:30.238\n&gt;&gt; Waiting [LAUGH].\n\n586\n00:26:30.238 --> 00:26:30.900\n&gt;&gt; It launched.\n\n587\n00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.431\nNotice, I didn't get a gatekeeper message.\n\n588\n00:26:33.431 --> 00:26:36.430\nNormally, gatekeeper would say, this\nsoftware was downloaded from the internet.\n\n589\n00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.970\nAre you sure you wanna open it?\n\n590\n00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.590\nI didn't get that, because it wasn't\ndownloaded from the internet.\n\n591\n00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.990\nIt was deployed by ARD.\n\n592\n00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.559\nThat means,\n\n593\n00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:46.020\nthe administrators on your network\nhave already approved the software.\n\n594\n00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.170\nIt's ready to go.\n\n595\n00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:50.430\nFor the end user,\nthey just magically got this software, and\n\n596\n00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:51.780\nall of a sudden it works.\n\n597\n00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.919\nAnd if you're on the phone with them, and\nyou're viewing their screen, you can say,\n\n598\n00:26:54.919 --> 00:26:55.569\nokay here you go.\n\n599\n00:26:55.569 --> 00:26:58.634\nNow you've got Cyberduck, and\nlet's get your SFTP server set up, and\n\n600\n00:26:58.634 --> 00:27:00.300\nyou start walking them through it.\n\n601\n00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.330\nThat's the type of experience you can\ncreate with Apple remote desktop.\n\n602\n00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:06.360\nYou guys see where I say like 80\nbucks is a pittance to be able\n\n603\n00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.470\nto do things like this.\n\n604\n00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:11.820\nAnd, we don't have time really to go\nthrough all the crazy features, but\n\n605\n00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.720\njust one more I wanna show for you.\n\n606\n00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.340\nLet's see what we can get in here.\n\n607\n00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.030\n&gt;&gt; Controls the rotation\nof the Earth [LAUGH].\n\n608\n00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well I used Copy\nto install the application.\n\n609\n00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.050\nRight beside it you've got Install, right?\n\n610\n00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.730\nIt seems like I should\nhave used that right?\n\n611\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.417\nInstall is for PKGs, right?\n\n612\n00:27:25.417 --> 00:27:26.120\nFor Packages.\n\n613\n00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.268\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; So if I have drivers,\n\n614\n00:27:27.268 --> 00:27:29.866\nsystem frameworks,\nsomebody calls and says I need Java.\n\n615\n00:27:29.866 --> 00:27:32.682\nAnd I don't wanna give them\nadministrative credentials to insert,\n\n616\n00:27:32.682 --> 00:27:34.816\ncuz packages always,\nI shouldn't say always, but\n\n617\n00:27:34.816 --> 00:27:36.823\nusually require\nadministrative credentials.\n\n618\n00:27:36.823 --> 00:27:40.240\nI can use the Install option to do it and\nI can push Java to their machines.\n\n619\n00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.250\nIf I wanna make sure\npeople are updating Java,\n\n620\n00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.155\nI can use these to make sure I'm updating.\n\n621\n00:27:44.155 --> 00:27:45.915\nI can run straight-up Unix commands.\n\n622\n00:27:45.915 --> 00:27:48.545\nSo if I've got shell commands\nthat I want to issue,\n\n623\n00:27:48.545 --> 00:27:50.405\nI don't have to fire up SSH and all that.\n\n624\n00:27:50.405 --> 00:27:53.065\nI can just come in here to the Unix\ncommand, I can type in what I wanna run,\n\n625\n00:27:53.065 --> 00:27:56.445\nI want to run uname -a, and\nmaybe I wanna run hostname.\n\n626\n00:27:56.445 --> 00:28:00.410\nRight, so what do I wanna run, I tell it\nwho I'm gonna run it on, these machines.\n\n627\n00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.789\nIf I wanna run it as a custom user or\nwhatever, and\n\n628\n00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:05.590\nI want it to display the output,\nI'll send that.\n\n629\n00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.740\nAnd it's gonna reach out to that\nmachine and it's gonna run it.\n\n630\n00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.000\nI can see here is the output for my first\ncommand, and here is the output for\n\n631\n00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:11.660\nthe second command.\n\n632\n00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.233\nAnd it just runs through an.\n\n633\n00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:15.693\nSo, you can have Shell Scripts so,\n\n634\n00:28:15.693 --> 00:28:19.638\na lot of time I'll do it\nlittle like get a script.\n\n635\n00:28:19.638 --> 00:28:22.198\nAnd then, you will execute the script\nlocally, and inform the action.\n\n636\n00:28:22.198 --> 00:28:24.075\nAnd then we'll remove\nthe script to clean up,\n\n637\n00:28:24.075 --> 00:28:26.760\nyou can have all of that\nwritten out really quick.\n\n638\n00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.120\nAnd then we've got our Reports.\n\n639\n00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.420\nAnd the reports are, or\nwhat I mentioned earlier I can jump in and\n\n640\n00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.120\nI can view all sorts of\ninformation about my computers.\n\n641\n00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.870\nThere's a lot of canned\nreports that are pretty handy.\n\n642\n00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.755\nSo you'll see these templates.\n\n643\n00:28:37.755 --> 00:28:41.330\nThese canned reports show you\ninformation about your systems.\n\n644\n00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.870\nBut you can customize them, and then save\nthem as templates to pull them up later.\n\n645\n00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.910\nSo, if you're looking for\nolder systems, or\n\n646\n00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:50.890\nsystems that have a certain hardware,\nor whatever, you can jump in.\n\n647\n00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.810\nIn finding all of the user history report,\nwho is using what computers?\n\n648\n00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:58.236\nWhen?\nYou can pull that, network interfaces,\n\n649\n00:28:58.236 --> 00:28:59.302\nUSB devices.\n\n650\n00:28:59.302 --> 00:29:03.152\nIf you found a unauthorized USB key\non a device, or if you're looking for\n\n651\n00:29:03.152 --> 00:29:04.760\nan authorized USB keys.\n\n652\n00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.484\nYou can come in and pull up a USB\ndevices report and run that, and\n\n653\n00:29:08.484 --> 00:29:10.814\nyou can pull all of these information.\n\n654\n00:29:10.814 --> 00:29:14.220\nNow, see this rebuild data for\nreport option?\n\n655\n00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.620\nIf we enable the report generation option,\n\n656\n00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:21.040\nit can actually automatically upload\nthat report data every night.\n\n657\n00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.230\nAnd so the information I\nlook at here might be old.\n\n658\n00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:24.820\nIt might be from last night.\n\n659\n00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.310\nIf I choose to rebuild data for\nthe report, it's gonna\n\n660\n00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:32.160\npull the machines right now, and make sure\nit gets the latest data for that system.\n\n661\n00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.820\nI actually have to choose that here,\ncuz I just turned this on.\n\n662\n00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.660\nI don't have any data from last night.\n\n663\n00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.675\nSo, when I turn that on,\nI can get that report.\n\n664\n00:29:38.675 --> 00:29:42.850\nIt's gonna reach out to that client, and\nit's gonna pull that information back.\n\n665\n00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.597\nAnd then,\nI'll have a report stored over here,\n\n666\n00:29:45.597 --> 00:29:48.014\nthere we go, and\nI can see the USB devices.\n\n667\n00:29:48.014 --> 00:29:49.238\nIt probably would have\nbeen more exciting if I\n\n668\n00:29:49.238 --> 00:29:50.725\nhad picked a device that had\nUSB stuff plugged into it.\n\n669\n00:29:50.725 --> 00:29:54.133\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But here I see the virtual USB hubs and\n\n670\n00:29:54.133 --> 00:29:55.020\nstuff, so.\n\n671\n00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.395\nBut that's the kind of thing\nthat we can do from ARD.\n\n672\n00:29:57.395 --> 00:29:58.937\nVery, very powerful, right?\n\n673\n00:29:58.937 --> 00:30:00.604\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It's got a lot of functionality, and\n\n674\n00:30:00.604 --> 00:30:02.419\nfor a help desk,\nthis type of tool is a godsend.\n\n675\n00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:04.990\nYou can do so much from within it.\n\n676\n00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:09.340\nAnd it goes so much further than just\nsharing simple resources on the network,\n\n677\n00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.410\nas far as administrator's concerned.\n\n678\n00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.570\nWe really have full access to the machine\nto be able to manage and maintain it.\n\n679\n00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:17.556\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, I'm surprised there's\nnot an alchemy tab on this thing.\n\n680\n00:30:17.556 --> 00:30:19.723\nLead, gold, no problem,\nwe can make that happen.\n\n681\n00:30:19.723 --> 00:30:22.090\nIt's super powerful, very, very nice.\n\n682\n00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:26.340\nAnd if you've ever worked at a help desk\nbefore, you are just going, my goodness,\n\n683\n00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.900\nthis is heaven sent,\nit's awesome, it's amazing.\n\n684\n00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.690\nHas a lot of great features built into it.\n\n685\n00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.144\nBut that being said,\nwe've kind of gotten through ARD,\n\n686\n00:30:34.144 --> 00:30:37.690\nall the stuff that you would\nneed to know for your exam here.\n\n687\n00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:40.420\nAnd we've got plenty of more options\nthat we need to move along with,\n\n688\n00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.935\nbut not a whole lot of time left\non our clock there Mr. Pezet.\n\n689\n00:30:43.935 --> 00:30:45.504\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe're gonna have to do a part three.\n\n690\n00:30:45.504 --> 00:30:47.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; I still haven't gotten to some\n\n691\n00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:49.140\nof the last sharing options to get to.\n\n692\n00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:53.360\nI really do love ARD, and so I probably\ntalked about it more than I should have.\n\n693\n00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.700\nBut on the exam,\nyou need to know what ARD is.\n\n694\n00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.550\nYou need to know what it does.\n\n695\n00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.599\nThey may even ask you how to enable it.\n\n696\n00:30:58.599 --> 00:31:01.603\nWhich is you know [CROSSTALK]\nwhich is really really hard.\n\n697\n00:31:01.603 --> 00:31:04.784\nBut in real life, do look into ARD,\nif you haven't already.\n\n698\n00:31:04.784 --> 00:31:07.420\nIt is 80 dollars, but\nit's 80 dollars well spent.\n\n699\n00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.890\nAnd you know you buy it once, and you\nhave it like I bought it six years ago or\n\n700\n00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:12.640\nsomething.\n\n701\n00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.380\nAnd so I still have it enabled,\nthat's just how it runs.\n\n702\n00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.570\nSo definitely check that one out.\n\n703\n00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.175\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff.\n\n704\n00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:19.770\nThanks for joining us today Don,\nand showing us ARD.\n\n705\n00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:24.480\nVery, like we said, can't just lot\nit up anymore than we have already.\n\n706\n00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.720\nIt's just an amazing product.\n\n707\n00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.880\nSo go out and play with it.\n\n708\n00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.370\nIf you need to buy that,\nlike Don said, money well spent.\n\n709\n00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:31.890\nGo make sure that happens.\n\n710\n00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:35.770\nBut we do have more content coming for\nsharing resources.\n\n711\n00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.560\nSo we're gonna have to roll\nthat into a part three.\n\n712\n00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.720\nCome on back for that.\n\n713\n00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.030\nAs for this episode,\nit is time to sign off.\n\n714\n00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:43.380\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n715\n00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.310\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.012\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.012 --> 00:00:11.530\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.537\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:17.060\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.160\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.370\nAnd in today's episode, well,\nwe're back with more of our ACSP series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.786\nJoining us yet again for a part three on\nresource sharing, our good friend Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:25.786 --> 00:00:26.320\nDon Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.442\nDon, good to have you yet\nagain for more resource sharing.\n\n12\n00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:31.227\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can never share to much, right?\n\n13\n00:00:31.227 --> 00:00:32.933\n&gt;&gt; No [LAUGH].\n\n14\n00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:36.243\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So what we're gonna do in this\nepisode is wrap up the last couple of\n\n15\n00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:38.521\nsharing items that I\ndidn't get to previously.\n\n16\n00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:41.743\nAnd then we'll talk a bit about\nconnecting to some of the shared items.\n\n17\n00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:44.958\nCuz we've really been looking at,\nbeing the person to share stuff out versus\n\n18\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.900\nactually getting connected\nto these things.\n\n19\n00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.490\nSo we got a good bit to run through and\n\n20\n00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.350\nthat's kind of where\nwe're gonna kick it off.\n\n21\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.090\nSo let me quit dilly dallying and\njump right into System Preferences so\n\n22\n00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.620\nwe can get right back to how this works.\n\n23\n00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.690\nAnd on my system,\n\n24\n00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.620\nhere if I go into my System Preferences,\nand I go back into sharing.\n\n25\n00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.510\nIn the previous episodes we've talked\nabout everything except these last three.\n\n26\n00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.330\nSo let's kind of discuss these.\n\n27\n00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.240\nThe third to the last one\nis Remote Apple Events.\n\n28\n00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.580\nAnd Remote Apple Events is a feature that\nis really not used by many people, so\n\n29\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.730\nit's typically turned off.\n\n30\n00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.230\nBut it's a way that one Mac OS\nsystem can send commands to another.\n\n31\n00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.600\nNow, that sounds kind of familiar, right?\n\n32\n00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.540\nIt sounds like something you'd do with\nApple Remote Desktop, or with SSH and\n\n33\n00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.900\nscripting and so on.\n\n34\n00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.700\nHere, Remote Apple Events are typically\nused through things like automator tasks.\n\n35\n00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.230\nSo if you go in the automator and\nyou build some giant automation routine,\n\n36\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.800\nit can actually send events out to other\nmachines to have them perform actions too.\n\n37\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.130\nSo you can synchronize actions\nacross multiple machines.\n\n38\n00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.160\nLike I said, it's not very frequently\nused, I don't have a lot of\n\n39\n00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.470\ngood use case scenarios for it because\nthings like ARD and Profile Manager\n\n40\n00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.860\ncan typically be a little more effective\nthan using the Remote Apple Events.\n\n41\n00:01:55.098 --> 00:01:58.840\nInternet Sharing, this is another one\nthat's not typically used anymore because\n\n42\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.500\nof the proliferation of wireless networks.\n\n43\n00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.160\nNow, it used to be in the old day,\nyou'd go to a hotel for example, and\n\n44\n00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.330\nin the hotel, there'd be a network\ncable on the desk, right?\n\n45\n00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.210\nAnd you can plug your computer\ninto that network cable, and\n\n46\n00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.830\nthat one computer had internet access.\n\n47\n00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.390\nBut what if you had other\ncomputers with you?\n\n48\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.080\nTough luck, there's only one cable,\nand that's that, right?\n\n49\n00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.850\nBut with Internet Sharing,\nif you had a Mac with two network adapters\n\n50\n00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.110\nyou could plug one adapter\ninto the internet connection.\n\n51\n00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.030\nAnd you could take the other adapter and\nplug it into another computer.\n\n52\n00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.090\nAnd you could share your\ninternet connection or\n\n53\n00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.920\nyou could use your wireless to do it too.\n\n54\n00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.190\nNotice over here, it's saying,\nShare my connection from and\n\n55\n00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.230\nI would pick the network adapter that was\nplugged in to the internet connection.\n\n56\n00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.250\nAnd then, To computers using and\nspecify how I wanted them to connect.\n\n57\n00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.490\nSo for example, I might be physically\nplugged in on my Ethernet port.\n\n58\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.830\nAnd I could turn on Sharing to my\nBluetooth Personal Area Network.\n\n59\n00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.869\nAnd Daniel could connect his\nlaptop to mine via Bluetooth,\n\n60\n00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.160\nand share my internet connection,right?\n\n61\n00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.350\nBut the reality is most places we\ngo have wireless networks now, and\n\n62\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.110\nso he can just piggy back\non my system via wireless.\n\n63\n00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.600\nAnd off you go.\n\n64\n00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.820\nI have heard of people that using this to\nlike get around Gogo Inflight Internet, or\n\n65\n00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.220\nsomething where you have paid internet.\n\n66\n00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.803\nYou have somebody piggy back through you.\n\n67\n00:03:13.803 --> 00:03:16.200\nSometimes that works,\nusually it doesn't it.\n\n68\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.750\nBut that's really what this functionality\nis for, not as frequently used but\n\n69\n00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.730\nit is still here and you can turn it on.\n\n70\n00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.070\nThe secret is having two\nnetwork connections.\n\n71\n00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.750\nOne to the internet and\none to your private network.\n\n72\n00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.760\nAnd a lot of systems like MacBooks\nthese days don't even have one internet\n\n73\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.700\nconnection aside from their wireless,\nthat have no physical, network checks.\n\n74\n00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.428\nSo you need a USBC dongle or\nsomething else to be able to do that.\n\n75\n00:03:38.428 --> 00:03:40.620\n&gt;&gt; So Don, it's interesting,\nI'm looking at your screen there and\n\n76\n00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.580\nit has Bluetooth Personal Area Network,\nthe PAN option but\n\n77\n00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.722\nright below that over in the list,\nwe have Bluetooth.\n\n78\n00:03:47.722 --> 00:03:48.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n79\n00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.785\nseems like Apple's getting\na little redundant here.\n\n80\n00:03:50.785 --> 00:03:52.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's multiple ways to\n\n81\n00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.940\nuse Bluetooth to share things, right?\n\n82\n00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.710\nSo what we're seeing here,\nwhere I've got Internet Sharing and\n\n83\n00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.590\nthe Bluetooth PAN,\nthat's sharing my Internet connection.\n\n84\n00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.820\nAnd Bluetooth, when you connect\ntwo systems via Bluetooth,\n\n85\n00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.830\nthey're actually using\nan IP based network.\n\n86\n00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.590\nYou have IP addresses and you communicate,\nthat's how Bluetooth works.\n\n87\n00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.960\nBut this is just sharing\nthat network connection.\n\n88\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.270\nWhat if I wanna share files?\n\n89\n00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.590\nWhat if I've got a picture\non a Android phone and\n\n90\n00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.530\nI wanna quickly get it onto my Mac?\n\n91\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.740\nWell I can't use AirDrop.\n\n92\n00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.675\nI can't use the normal protocols that\nwe have that are part of an iPhone,\n\n93\n00:04:20.675 --> 00:04:22.270\nan Android phone doesn't have those.\n\n94\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.780\nBut, I can take the Android phone, and\nI can pair it to my system with Bluetooth.\n\n95\n00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.430\nAnd if I do that, I can then send and\nreceive files using Bluetooth or\n\n96\n00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.300\neven between laptops and\nthings you can use Bluetooth to do it.\n\n97\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.380\nAirDrop is easier if you have two Macs or\nwhatever that's seamless.\n\n98\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.710\nBut when you're going between a Mac and\nsome other kind of system,\n\n99\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.600\nBluetooth is usually the easiest and so\n\n100\n00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.920\nhere it's showing,\nwhen receiving an item, what do we do?\n\n101\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.390\nWhen we send an item, what do we do?\n\n102\n00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.490\nHow do we provide data or receive data?\n\n103\n00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.360\nAnd so you can go in and\ndo that via Bluetooth.\n\n104\n00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.250\nSo that's kind of the last method of\nsharing that we've got here in the list.\n\n105\n00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.110\nAnd there's others that can pop up,\nif you have specialized hardware.\n\n106\n00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.670\nRemember my CD/DVD sharing, it's gone now,\ncuz I unhooked the SuperDrive.\n\n107\n00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.290\nSo there's other ones that can pop up.\n\n108\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.560\nBut that list right there,\n\n109\n00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.740\nkind of completes the built in\nsharing that we have in Mac OS.\n\n110\n00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.970\n&gt;&gt; Well there it is, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n111\n00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.630\nSome like I like to say,\ndigital communism.\n\n112\n00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.410\nWe're sharing all of our\nresources with everyone.\n\n113\n00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.900\nNow we talked about file sharing\nbefore we kinda got into that, but\n\n114\n00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.340\nwe kinda looked at it from\nthe angle of the server.\n\n115\n00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.610\nWe're setting up file sharing and not so\n\n116\n00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.500\nmuch from the client side,\nhow do I connect to the different types of\n\n117\n00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.180\nfile sharing types that\nmight be available to me?\n\n118\n00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.290\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the clients,\n\n119\n00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.600\nthey have a few different ways\nof getting connected, right?\n\n120\n00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.230\nAnd when it comes to files,\nwhich is usually what we're doing, right?\n\n121\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.360\nFolder sharing, a lot of it is somewhat\nautomatic, if I launch my Finder.\n\n122\n00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.949\nThe key secret here to sharing files over\nthe network is if you look on down here,\n\n123\n00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.310\nyour left side here, and browse down,\nyou'll see a section that says Shared.\n\n124\n00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.070\nAnd under Shared you'll\nsee a couple of servers,\n\n125\n00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.920\ntypically ones you've used recently,\nand then you'll see All.\n\n126\n00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.600\nAnd if I go to All, here it's showing me\neverything that it found on the network\n\n127\n00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.040\nthat I can connect to and\nI see a bunch of systems.\n\n128\n00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.850\nI see some Macs,\nI see some Windows machines, and\n\n129\n00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.460\nI see some unknown machines,\nwhere it doesn't know the heck they are.\n\n130\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.170\nI see just a bunch of stuff that's out\nthere, and I can browse to these and\n\n131\n00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.680\nconnect to their resources.\n\n132\n00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.160\nFor most users, that's going to\nbe the easiest way to do it.\n\n133\n00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.610\nSo if I wanna connect to one of my lab\nmachines, I can find it here in the list,\n\n134\n00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.450\nlike LAB-CLIENT01.\n\n135\n00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.260\nAnd I can just double click on it and\nit's gonna try and connect.\n\n136\n00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.960\nNow it's connecting as a guest account.\n\n137\n00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.470\nAnd so I can hit Connect As\nto provide credentials.\n\n138\n00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.120\nSometimes you need to do this so\nyou won't be able to see anything.\n\n139\n00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.894\nAnd when I connect now I can\nstart to see resources, right?\n\n140\n00:06:38.894 --> 00:06:42.600\nNow I'm connected to the system,\nnot necessarily the resource.\n\n141\n00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.370\nNow I need to pick a folder to connect to.\n\n142\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.850\nSo maybe I want\nSamantha Jones's Public Folder.\n\n143\n00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.070\nAnd when I double click on it,\nnow I'm actually connected.\n\n144\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.580\nWhen you connect, you'll actually\nsee the item mount over here, and\n\n145\n00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.720\nI'll talk about mounts\nhere in a few minutes.\n\n146\n00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.480\nBut it'll show up with that\nlittle eject icon on it, and\n\n147\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.100\nthat's how I know that\nI'm actually connected.\n\n148\n00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.840\nAnd if you have it turned on, you'll\nsee a desktop icon up here for it too.\n\n149\n00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.120\nSo now I've got Samantha Jones's\nPublic Folder showing up right there\n\n150\n00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.860\non my desktop.\n\n151\n00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.350\nAnd apparently, at some point, I connected\nto the HelpDesk's Public Folder also.\n\n152\n00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.740\nAnd those are showing up on the desktop.\n\n153\n00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.350\nNow those may not show up for you,\n\n154\n00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.370\nbecause I believe the default\nsetting has those turned off.\n\n155\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.170\nIt's one of the things I like to turn on.\n\n156\n00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.230\nIn the Finder, you have various\npreferences that dictate whether\n\n157\n00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.430\nthings are turned on or off,\nwhether they show up in the sidebar.\n\n158\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.080\nAnd then you also have in your\nSystem Preferences, if you go into\n\n159\n00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.982\nSystem Preferences, and let's see,\nis it Desktop &amp; Screen Saver or General?\n\n160\n00:07:34.982 --> 00:07:37.670\nIt is General, I was in the wrong spot.\n\n161\n00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.620\nIf you go under General,\n\n162\n00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.710\nyou'll see options in here that pick what\nshows up on your desktop and what doesn't.\n\n163\n00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.425\nOr actually, you know what,\nam I still in the wrong place?\n\n164\n00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:50.810\n[LAUGH] Things get moved around a good\nbit, and you've got to hunt and find them.\n\n165\n00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.087\nBut there's an option in here\nwhere you can turn it on to say,\n\n166\n00:07:54.087 --> 00:07:57.444\nI want to see these icons on my desktop,\nversus being hidden.\n\n167\n00:07:57.444 --> 00:08:01.501\nEven under the Finder though,\nif I go into my Finder Preferences You'll\n\n168\n00:08:01.501 --> 00:08:05.705\nsee under the Shared section things\nlike Back to My Map might be turned off.\n\n169\n00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:07.700\nYou can turn those on and they'll show up.\n\n170\n00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.830\nConnected Servers, Bonjour computers,\n\n171\n00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.950\nthings that we're discovering,\nthose are gonna show up.\n\n172\n00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.910\nIt's gonna find them and\nthey just magically show up.\n\n173\n00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.620\nIf you remember two episodes ago\nnow when we did the CD/DVD sharing.\n\n174\n00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.533\nWhere Daniel didn't really have\nto setup anything in his machine.\n\n175\n00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:24.400\nHe automatically saw my computer\nthat was sharing it out.\n\n176\n00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.950\nHe just had to connect to it and\nrequest some permissions.\n\n177\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.640\nSo usually we're connecting right\nhere via the finder, right?\n\n178\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.830\nBut there are times were we don't discover\nthe server that we wanna connect to.\n\n179\n00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.010\nWe go to share, we even go to all and\n\n180\n00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.320\nthe server we're trying to\nconnect to doesn't show up.\n\n181\n00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.300\nAnd if that happens, it maybe that\ndiscovery is just not finding it.\n\n182\n00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:49.590\nAnd so we can use the finders\nGo menu up top and use Go and\n\n183\n00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.360\nthen at the bottom of the Go Menu, you'll\nsee, Connect to Server or command K.\n\n184\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.890\nWhen you choose Connect to Server,\nyou get a little dialogue box and\n\n185\n00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:02.330\nyou can type in the name\nof a server to connect to.\n\n186\n00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.645\nAnd this way you don't\nhave to discover it.\n\n187\n00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:07.880\nThere might be a firewall or routers\nin between you that block discovery but\n\n188\n00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.700\nyou can connect if you know\nthe Server to Connect to.\n\n189\n00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.200\nNow, the key thing about\nhow you connect here,\n\n190\n00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.870\nis you have to remember\nthe names of the devices, right?\n\n191\n00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.060\nThe way this is built up,\nis that the first thing is the protocol.\n\n192\n00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.835\nAnd there's a ton of protocols\nthat are supported here.\n\n193\n00:09:19.835 --> 00:09:24.940\nsmb:// would be the server message block,\nthat's the default.\n\n194\n00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.100\nThen we've got afp, for\nApple file protocol.\n\n195\n00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.970\nAnd then you then come in and specify\nthe server that you were connecting to.\n\n196\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.500\nLike I might connect to lab-server01,\nright?\n\n197\n00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.870\nNow I can't remember the name of\nthe shared folder I wanna connect to.\n\n198\n00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.400\nSo I might leave that off, and\njust try and connect to the server itself.\n\n199\n00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.700\nAnd if I do that, I type in\nthe server name, and I hit Connect.\n\n200\n00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.870\nIt's gonna reach out to that server and\nit's telling me, it may not exist.\n\n201\n00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.690\nWell great, did I get the name wrong?\n\n202\n00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.380\nBecause I may have\ngotten the name wrong or\n\n203\n00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.300\nI may have turned off file sharing on it,\nI can't remember.\n\n204\n00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.140\nSo we can try a different protocol\nlike smb and we could try and connect.\n\n205\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.210\nAnd it's gonna reach out to that\nserver and establish a connection.\n\n206\n00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.400\nSo there it goes trying to connect and\nsee if it can get there.\n\n207\n00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.240\nIt may prompt me for credentials, or\n\n208\n00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.670\nit might tell me that's\nit's not able to get there.\n\n209\n00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:07.800\nLet me check my lab server and\n\n210\n00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.320\nmake sure it's actually sharing something,\nthat's the other thing.\n\n211\n00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.760\nIt's kinda hard to connect to a system\nif it's not actually sharing anything.\n\n212\n00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.890\nSo you'll wanna make sure\nyou've got that turned on.\n\n213\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.100\nSo I'm just gonna jump in here and\nshare something real quick.\n\n214\n00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.270\nBut we do need to provide credentials.\n\n215\n00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.945\nNow afp and smb, those are the two most\ncommon but there is plenty of other\n\n216\n00:10:24.945 --> 00:10:28.630\nprotocols that are supported through that\nbox like, wait to get this logged in.\n\n217\n00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:33.240\nThere is things like SFTP,\nlike sftp:// or provide credentials.\n\n218\n00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.301\nYou can do, let's see, a WebDAV, web\ndistribute authoring and versioning web.\n\n219\n00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:42.560\nWebDAV is a protocol that's really,\nit's not used by a lot of people.\n\n220\n00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.380\nBut it does give you to\nseamlessly interact or storage,\n\n221\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.960\nusually that's stored in\na web server somewhere.\n\n222\n00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.707\nAnd for it, because it's a web based\nprotocol, it's actually https or\n\n223\n00:10:51.707 --> 00:10:54.235\nhttp depending on whether\nit's secure enough.\n\n224\n00:10:54.235 --> 00:10:59.498\nAnd when you connect that way it's\ngonna reach out to that system and\n\n225\n00:10:59.498 --> 00:11:02.188\nconnect via the WebDAV protocol.\n\n226\n00:11:02.188 --> 00:11:07.162\nThere is NFS also, so\nyou can type in nfs://connect and\n\n227\n00:11:07.162 --> 00:11:09.607\nthen there is the older FTP.\n\n228\n00:11:09.607 --> 00:11:12.830\nThey're unencrypted file transfer\nprotocol that you can use too.\n\n229\n00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.970\nThere is other things we can type in,\nI don't have one set up but\n\n230\n00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:21.110\nfor example instead of a file protocol,\nI can do things like VMC, right.\n\n231\n00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.530\nVMC is a screen sharing program and\nthat's gonna allow me to connect up and\n\n232\n00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.090\nsee the screen.\n\n233\n00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.930\nThe screen sharing that's built-in\nto Mac OS is actually built on VMC,\n\n234\n00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.150\nthe virtual network computing protocol.\n\n235\n00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.750\nAnd you can use that to\nconnect up via the screen and\n\n236\n00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.970\nwork with it, but\nwe typically used back to my Mac or\n\n237\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.550\nARD, one of the other programs to\nbe able to pull up that screen.\n\n238\n00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.090\nSo we never interact with\nthe VNC directly, but\n\n239\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.877\nyou can, that functionality is there.\n\n240\n00:11:44.877 --> 00:11:48.250\n&gt;&gt; Dan, quick question from our channel\nactually, they are asking about\n\n241\n00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:52.990\nthe clients advertising there\nshares to people out in the world,\n\n242\n00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.860\nis there a way to stop\nthat from happening?\n\n243\n00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.467\nThere is, so your machine will advertise\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n\n244\n00:11:58.467 --> 00:11:59.680\n&gt;&gt; That's what it does.\n\n245\n00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.850\nSo when you start turning on sharing,\nthere's a number of\n\n246\n00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.670\ndiscovery protocols and advertisements\nthat start happening, right.\n\n247\n00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.450\nAnd you can certainly restrict that.\n\n248\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.590\nOn the server that's really easy, right.\n\n249\n00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.610\nSo I was pulling up the server here.\n\n250\n00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.370\nWhen I go into file sharing on the server,\nand I start configuring it,\n\n251\n00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.970\nyou've got permissions right here where\nyou can dictate who is allowed to connect.\n\n252\n00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.916\nAnd if I edit those permissions, you can\nspecify what users are allowed to connect,\n\n253\n00:12:24.916 --> 00:12:26.929\nand what networks are allowed to connect.\n\n254\n00:12:26.929 --> 00:12:30.077\nSo you can limit to private networks,\nor even some networking,\n\n255\n00:12:30.077 --> 00:12:33.280\nspecifically put in the sub-nets\nthat you want to allow.\n\n256\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.840\nThat's one way of limiting it.\n\n257\n00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.310\nOn a workstation, the workstation is gonna\nadvertise itself, but not to the internet.\n\n258\n00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.510\nIt's only gonna be advertising\nitself to the local network.\n\n259\n00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.890\nAnd if you wanna control access there,\nthat's a little bit different.\n\n260\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:51.050\nBecause what you do is you go\ninto your sharing settings.\n\n261\n00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:58.420\nAnd you're supposed to just control\nit based on the user account, right?\n\n262\n00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.870\nSo if I am doing file sharing,\nand I'm sharing out my data,\n\n263\n00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.650\npeople can connect to it and\nI specify the users here.\n\n264\n00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.900\nAnd if I take that everyone and deny them\naccess, then they would have to have\n\n265\n00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.570\na valid user account to be able to\nlog in and access that resource.\n\n266\n00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.950\nSo I might be advertising myself,\nbut people can't get to it.\n\n267\n00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:19.100\nRight now if I wanna go a step further and\nsay I wanna actively\n\n268\n00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.650\nblock the advertisements,\nthat's a little bit harder.\n\n269\n00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.819\nAnd really Apple doesn't truly support it\ncuz they want this stuff to just work, and\n\n270\n00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:29.473\nif you start disabling\nthings it doesn't just work.\n\n271\n00:13:29.473 --> 00:13:32.912\nBut if you go into security and\nprivacy, you can go into the firewall.\n\n272\n00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:36.734\nAnd in the firewall,\nif you turn that on and configure it,\n\n273\n00:13:36.734 --> 00:13:41.414\nyou can restrict who is allowed to\nconnect in on different protocols and\n\n274\n00:13:41.414 --> 00:13:44.310\nnow you can start to\ngate that a little more.\n\n275\n00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.411\nNow, the GUI for\nthe firewall is not terribly powerful.\n\n276\n00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:51.011\nSo you'll see I don't have a ton\nof options when I get into it,\n\n277\n00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:53.030\nlet me turn it on.\n\n278\n00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.840\nAnd I'll go into the Firewall Options,\nthat when I go in here, you'll see where\n\n279\n00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.750\nI've got SMB is being allowed, and\nRemote Management, and Screen Sharing.\n\n280\n00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.170\nThese guys are being allowed.\n\n281\n00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:06.170\nThat if I add a rule, if I hit the little\nplus sign, it just lets me pick\n\n282\n00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.730\nan application and add that application\nto allow it to communicate.\n\n283\n00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.970\nIt's not really letting\nme get super granular and\n\n284\n00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.950\nsay I won't allow this protocol or\nthat protocol.\n\n285\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.290\nBut what you do have is this\nneat little option down here\n\n286\n00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.230\ncalled Enable stealth mode.\n\n287\n00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.676\nAnd stealth mode says, don't respond to or\nacknowledge any attempt to access this\n\n288\n00:14:24.676 --> 00:14:27.417\ncomputer by test applications\nlike ICMP and Ping.\n\n289\n00:14:27.417 --> 00:14:31.380\nAnd that'll stop people from finding\nyour machine to try and connect.\n\n290\n00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.010\nBut you're still sending\nout Bonjour advertisements.\n\n291\n00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.250\nIf you turn off file sharing\nyou'll stop doing those, so\n\n292\n00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:41.760\nyou're kind of limited there as far as\nwhat you can turn off, and whatnot.\n\n293\n00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.050\nNow, in a workplace you\nmight want to say that.\n\n294\n00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:44.640\nYou might wanna say,\n\n295\n00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.310\nyou know what, I don't want my\nclients sharing out anything.\n\n296\n00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.130\nI want my server sharing it out.\n\n297\n00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.810\nAnd for that,\nyou can use the profile manager.\n\n298\n00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.320\nAnd we don't really cover\nthe profile manager in this series,\n\n299\n00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.800\nit's part of the Apple certified\ntechnical coordinator.\n\n300\n00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.491\nBut if you ever installed the server app,\nit's a very, very powerful utilities.\n\n301\n00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:05.919\nIt's part of the server app, and if you\ngo under Services and Profile Manger,\n\n302\n00:15:05.919 --> 00:15:08.870\nwhat you can do is in Profile Manager,\nyou can define\n\n303\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:13.730\nthe settings where you can restrict who is\nallowed to share folders, and who's not?\n\n304\n00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.690\nWhat shared folders are present?\n\n305\n00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.220\nWho has permission?\n\n306\n00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.770\nYou can really lock down your systems.\n\n307\n00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.770\nAnd so, you can create a policy that\nprevents people from enabling Bonjour\n\n308\n00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.240\ndiscovery, and other things.\n\n309\n00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.020\nBut it's not as effective as\njust implementing a firewall,\n\n310\n00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:29.730\nthat's usually easier.\n\n311\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.260\nYou stick a firewall on your network,\n\n312\n00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.710\nand you limit those advertisements\nto your internal network.\n\n313\n00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.070\nAnd that, typically,\nis the best way to go about it.\n\n314\n00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:40.010\nAll right, so Don, our Macs, they\nobviously they can find each other, right?\n\n315\n00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.880\nThey CO,\nthere's another Mac on my network, or\n\n316\n00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.540\nthere's another computer on my network.\n\n317\n00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.720\nOr what about the specific\nservices that they're offering?\n\n318\n00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.666\nLike if you have a service stood up,\nand I know it runs FTP,\n\n319\n00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:52.360\nwell, then I can connect to FTP.\n\n320\n00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.920\nBut what if I don't know it's running FTP,\nand\n\n321\n00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.230\nI wanna know what services it's running.\n\n322\n00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.100\nIs there a way for us to do that?\n\n323\n00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.874\nYeah, so normally, what we do is, we\nrely on the Finder because the Finder is\n\n324\n00:16:01.874 --> 00:16:04.740\nrunning all the different\ndiscovery protocols, right?\n\n325\n00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.260\nLet me run down the list here, and\nI can't remember them all, but\n\n326\n00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.432\nfortunately I've got them written on\nthis piece of paper in front of me.\n\n327\n00:16:10.432 --> 00:16:12.106\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, Bonjour, we've talked about,\n\n328\n00:16:12.106 --> 00:16:13.067\nwe know that one, right?\n\n329\n00:16:13.067 --> 00:16:15.511\nBonjour's designed to just\nbroadcast out and find things and\n\n330\n00:16:15.511 --> 00:16:17.990\nlearn about all the different\nstuff that's available.\n\n331\n00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:19.980\nWhen I turned on CD and DVD sharing,\n\n332\n00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.660\nDaniel's laptop already knew about it\nbecause we were talking with Bonjour.\n\n333\n00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.030\nIt's a great protocol for doing\nsimple discovery on a single network.\n\n334\n00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:30.440\nAll right, there's other protocols\nthat are available also, though.\n\n335\n00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:37.050\nFor example, there is what's called zero\nconfiguration where DHCP tells you things.\n\n336\n00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.740\nSo when you boot up and\nget a DHCP address,\n\n337\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.180\nDHCP can hand you a lot of other\nvalues like a boot p server or\n\n338\n00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.200\na server that's got some kind\nof a script attached to it.\n\n339\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.960\nAnd you can pull that\ninformation that way.\n\n340\n00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.450\nThat's a much more technical way, and\nMacOS doesn't normally rely on those, so\n\n341\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:54.150\nwe typically don't want to,\ntypically we don't make use of that.\n\n342\n00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.392\nIt's really more useful for\n\n343\n00:16:55.392 --> 00:16:59.350\nappliances and things like\nVoiceOver IP phones, stuff like that.\n\n344\n00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.940\nIPv6, if your Mac is running IPv6,\nwhich they all are, then you're running\n\n345\n00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.600\nsomething in the background called MDNS,\nor the multicast DNS.\n\n346\n00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.350\nAnd the multicast DNS responder is\na service that runs on your Mac that's\n\n347\n00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:16.900\nanswering for DNS queries that, and\nit's not necessarily DNS named to IP,\n\n348\n00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.220\nbut where Daniel's Mac might send\na message out saying, hey, I'm looking for\n\n349\n00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:21.979\na shared printer.\n\n350\n00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.810\nOr I'm looking for somebody who's\nsharing their Internet connection.\n\n351\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.810\nAnd my MDNS responder will hear that and\nrespond back and say,\n\n352\n00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:32.260\nhey, I'm sharing my Internet connection,\nhere's my IP use me as a router.\n\n353\n00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.880\nAnd it'll actually communicate that way.\n\n354\n00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.160\nSo IPv6 can help with that discovery.\n\n355\n00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.350\nAnd that's kind of the way of the future.\n\n356\n00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.540\nEventually, that will replace Bonjour for\n\n357\n00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:47.540\nany kind of multi-network communications,\nbut that hasn't quite happened yet.\n\n358\n00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.850\nSo that one's going on in the background.\n\n359\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.300\nThat's all a kind of a part of the system.\n\n360\n00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.170\nIt's just one of the other discoveries.\n\n361\n00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.310\nSo when you go into the Finder,\nit's already doing a lot of this stuff.\n\n362\n00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:58.969\nSo when you come in here and you look at\nthose shared resources on the network and\n\n363\n00:17:58.969 --> 00:18:01.710\nit's finding something like that server.\n\n364\n00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:02.230\nThere we go.\n\n365\n00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.910\nI don't necessarily know what\nprotocol I used to do it, right?\n\n366\n00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.510\nAFP, SMB, whatever.\n\n367\n00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.110\n&gt;&gt; Cuz really,\nat this point it doesn't matter, right?\n\n368\n00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.410\nAs long as you can access the resource.\n\n369\n00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nhow it was discovered doesn't matter.\n\n370\n00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.020\nAs long as it was found, it comes up.\n\n371\n00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.620\nWhere it matters, though,\nis if you can't see it, right?\n\n372\n00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.715\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Even if we have a problem,\n\n373\n00:18:17.715 --> 00:18:19.564\nwe're not able to see\nthe system we wanna connect to.\n\n374\n00:18:19.564 --> 00:18:21.740\nAnd that's when we have to start\ndoing some troubleshooting.\n\n375\n00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.110\nAnd troubleshooting the different\nprotocols can always be a little on\n\n376\n00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.720\nthe challenging side.\n\n377\n00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.770\nSo speaking of troubleshooting,\nlet's talk about that just real briefly.\n\n378\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.160\nThere are tools for\ntroubleshooting connectivity.\n\n379\n00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.950\nSo, for example, when I was on\nmy desktop just a moment ago,\n\n380\n00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.380\nI tried to connect to LABSERVER-01 and\nit failed, right?\n\n381\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.460\nAnd that was annoying.\n\n382\n00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.770\nI don't know why that was,\nI'll have to find out.\n\n383\n00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.938\nBut on this client, I just clicked on\nLABSERVER-01 and it connected right away.\n\n384\n00:18:44.938 --> 00:18:47.360\nWell, probably cuz this one is joined\nto the same open directory, so\n\n385\n00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.180\nthey're bound at the same directory,\nso they authenticated.\n\n386\n00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.870\nBut I can see that folder right there, and\n\n387\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.160\nconnect up even though\nI'm a guest right now.\n\n388\n00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.530\nDidn't even authenticate you're connected.\n\n389\n00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.445\nSo this one is working great,\nmy laptop not so much.\n\n390\n00:18:58.445 --> 00:19:00.200\nI've done something to my laptop.\n\n391\n00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.130\nSo, if I have to troubleshoot,\nhow do I do that, right?\n\n392\n00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.120\nHow do I troubleshoot\ndo something like this?\n\n393\n00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.300\nThe easiest way is to a tool\ncalled the Network Utility, right?\n\n394\n00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.010\nLet me close out of all that mess.\n\n395\n00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.330\nAnd I'm gonna launch my Network Utility.\n\n396\n00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.570\nIt's inside your application folder\nin another folder called Utilities.\n\n397\n00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.720\nSo if you go to Applications and\nthen Utilities,\n\n398\n00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.070\nthen you'll see the Network Utility.\n\n399\n00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.930\nOr I usually just launch\nit with the Spotlight.\n\n400\n00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:29.090\nOnce you're in here, though, it's got\nsome really neat information, right?\n\n401\n00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.470\nYou can click on the Info tab and\nyou can see your IP address.\n\n402\n00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.530\nAnd be aware that you have a separate IP\nfor each of your network adapters, so\n\n403\n00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.540\nyou may need to come in and look at more\nthan one before you find the adapter\n\n404\n00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.540\nthat's on the right network\nthat's communicating.\n\n405\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.270\nSo, for example, I have a Thunderbolt\ndongle that I'm plugged into here.\n\n406\n00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.140\nAnd I just chose all three of\nthese Thunderbolt dongles and\n\n407\n00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.210\nnot one of them had an IP address.\n\n408\n00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:54.490\nSo either my physical network\nis not working or, well,\n\n409\n00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:55.830\nthis one's receiving packets.\n\n410\n00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.580\nBut see how as I look at this one I\ncan see that it's receiving packets.\n\n411\n00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.480\nThat number's actually going up.\n\n412\n00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.160\nBut I haven't sent a single\npacket over this interface.\n\n413\n00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.730\nI'm not actually using it.\n\n414\n00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:08.110\nI don't have any errors.\n\n415\n00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.770\nBut there's definitely\nsomething wrong here.\n\n416\n00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.400\nI'm not using my physical\nadapter like I should.\n\n417\n00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.230\nSo based on this information,\nI can kind of spot that problem.\n\n418\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.970\nI can see there's an issue.\n\n419\n00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.130\nThat's what the network\nutility is all about.\n\n420\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.940\nIf I'm not able to communicate it,\nthere's something going on here.\n\n421\n00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.130\nAnd so, I can try unplugging that adapter.\n\n422\n00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.080\nSo I just unplugged it, and\nsee how it switched to inactive?\n\n423\n00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.020\nAnd I'm gonna plug it back in,\nand we'll see what happens.\n\n424\n00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.050\nIt's kinda like a computer.\n\n425\n00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.620\nSometimes you gotta reboot it,\nwell, it'll take this network card.\n\n426\n00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.010\nAnd it just went active.\n\n427\n00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:35.720\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n428\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.485\n&gt;&gt; Still no IP address.\n\n429\n00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.249\n&gt;&gt; You're sending, you sent a little data.\n\n430\n00:20:38.249 --> 00:20:40.838\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I should be sending\nout DHCP requests, saying,\n\n431\n00:20:40.838 --> 00:20:42.960\ncan somebody please give me an IP address?\n\n432\n00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.410\nAnd then I should be getting an answer,\nand that's not happening.\n\n433\n00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.510\nAnd so, what happened before\nis eventually you give up,\n\n434\n00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.670\nand then we don't sit on\nthat adapter anymore.\n\n435\n00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.790\nI've go my wireless adapter,\nI'll use that instead.\n\n436\n00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.420\nSo that's the kind of thing we can\nsee here, and then go and try and\n\n437\n00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.080\nisolate and find out.\n\n438\n00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.095\nSome of the other tools\nthat we have are Netstat.\n\n439\n00:20:59.095 --> 00:21:01.235\nNetstat can do, it can do a ton of things,\n\n440\n00:21:01.235 --> 00:21:03.155\nit could show everybody who is\nconnected to your computer.\n\n441\n00:21:03.155 --> 00:21:05.885\nSo I wanna know how is connected to my\ncomputer right now I can pull that up.\n\n442\n00:21:05.885 --> 00:21:08.255\nYou've got comprehensive\nnetwork statistics and\n\n443\n00:21:08.255 --> 00:21:09.975\nall current socket connections.\n\n444\n00:21:09.975 --> 00:21:13.305\nThat's showing me everybody who\nis connected to my machine.\n\n445\n00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:16.000\nBut the one that is most useful for\nme is this routing table.\n\n446\n00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.900\nWhen you display that, it shows how\nyou would access other networks,\n\n447\n00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.610\nboth local and remote.\n\n448\n00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.330\nAnd it's gonna take a little while to\nrun on mine because of my dead network\n\n449\n00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.630\nadapter, it's trying to figure out\nwhat routes are attached to it.\n\n450\n00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.340\nNormally, it runs pretty fast,\nand it spits out a routing table.\n\n451\n00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.550\nSo that'll come up here in just a moment.\n\n452\n00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.510\nActually, it'll probably be faster\nto pull it up here on my VM.\n\n453\n00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.990\nSince my laptop is not happy,\nwe'll go to a VM that is.\n\n454\n00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.090\nSo when I go here and pull up\na routing table, that should come up.\n\n455\n00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.187\nWell, apparently,\nit's gonna take a while there, too.\n\n456\n00:21:43.187 --> 00:21:43.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n457\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.220\nwe'll wait for\na second while it does that.\n\n458\n00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.200\nBut it's gonna display how it\ngets to different networks.\n\n459\n00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.850\nIf you have more than one network adapter,\nthis is a great way to see, like, look,\n\n460\n00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.290\nI'm going out my wireless instead\nof going out my physical adapter.\n\n461\n00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.360\nAnd you can figure out\nhow that's communicating.\n\n462\n00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.330\nDiscovery might not be working properly,\nbut\n\n463\n00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.350\nit turns out your using the wrong network.\n\n464\n00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.250\nIt makes sense you wouldn't be\nable to do the discovery, right?\n\n465\n00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.640\nSo some of the other tools\nare things like Ping.\n\n466\n00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.220\nPing is an incredibly useful\ntool because you can use it to,\n\n467\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.670\nI call it troubleshooting\nfrom the inside out.\n\n468\n00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:16.562\nIf there's a problem between me and\nDaniel's laptop, all right?\n\n469\n00:22:16.562 --> 00:22:18.430\nWell, I need to figure out\nwhere that problem is.\n\n470\n00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.470\nIt could be his laptop.\n\n471\n00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:20.370\nIt could be my laptop.\n\n472\n00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.540\nIt could be the network in between us,\nright?\n\n473\n00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.320\nSo what I'll usually do\nis I'll ask Daniel, hey,\n\n474\n00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.420\nDaniel can you tell me\nwhat your IP address is?\n\n475\n00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.680\nAnd he can go into the network utility and\nit'll tell him the IP address.\n\n476\n00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.527\nI'll just use the IP address\nto one of my servers here.\n\n477\n00:22:31.527 --> 00:22:35.822\nSo I'm on this machine,\nwhich is 192.168.0.129, and\n\n478\n00:22:35.822 --> 00:22:41.850\nif I'm trying to talk to a server at\n192.168.0.11, why can't I get there?\n\n479\n00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.920\nWell, let's figure out\nwhere the problem is.\n\n480\n00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.940\nI'll start by pinging myself.\n\n481\n00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.470\nNow when you ping yourself,\nthere's two ways to do it.\n\n482\n00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:52.060\nYou can use the loopback,\nwhich is a virtual address, 127.0.0.1.\n\n483\n00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.460\nThat's testing the software.\n\n484\n00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.770\nIs my TCP/IP stack working?\n\n485\n00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:01.100\nAnd so if I do that and I ping,\nyou should always get responses here.\n\n486\n00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.775\nIf you don't, it means your\noperating system is damaged and\n\n487\n00:23:03.775 --> 00:23:06.980\nyou'll need to go into recovery and\nreinstall MacOS.\n\n488\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.090\nSo it's a lot of hassle,\nyou don't want to do that.\n\n489\n00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.320\nSo hopefully that will work.\n\n490\n00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.320\nThen, you can try to ping your own IP,\nright?\n\n491\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.590\nSo this one is 192.168.0.129,\nso I'll go in and ping that.\n\n492\n00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:23.160\nAnd when I do that, if this fails, that\nusually means either I've got to duplicate\n\n493\n00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.700\nIP address or\nthere's something wrong with my link.\n\n494\n00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.970\nI might not have a link light on my\nNetwork Adapter, that kind of a problem.\n\n495\n00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.010\nAfter that, if I'm going through a router,\nI can ping the router.\n\n496\n00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.920\nAnd if I can ping the router, then I\nknow I'm at least getting to it, and\n\n497\n00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.540\nthe next I can ping all\nthe way to my destination.\n\n498\n00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.330\nAnd in my case, the destination is .11,\nand I can ping it.\n\n499\n00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:46.136\nWhat's nice here is you keep\ntrying each of these, and\n\n500\n00:23:46.136 --> 00:23:49.492\nthe one that fails is usually\nthe one that is the problem, right?\n\n501\n00:23:49.492 --> 00:23:53.764\nNow, to make it easier, cuz there might\nbe a number of devices between you and\n\n502\n00:23:53.764 --> 00:23:56.985\nthe destination,\nyou can jump over here to trace route And\n\n503\n00:23:56.985 --> 00:23:59.176\ntrace route will do all of that for you.\n\n504\n00:23:59.176 --> 00:24:03.630\nYou type in who it is you wanna ping so\nmaybe I want to ping Google's DNS servers.\n\n505\n00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:05.870\nI can't get to Google's DNS servers for\nsome reason.\n\n506\n00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.973\nAnd when you do a trace route,\nit doesn't just ping out to Google.\n\n507\n00:24:08.973 --> 00:24:12.919\nIt pings Google and\neverything in between you and there.\n\n508\n00:24:12.919 --> 00:24:15.620\nAnd so, when I trace that here it goes.\n\n509\n00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.490\nIt's hitting my router and\nthen it's taking the next step,\n\n510\n00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.690\nwhich should be hitting\nthe firewall here in our building.\n\n511\n00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.430\nAnd then the next step out on\nto the Internet and beyond.\n\n512\n00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.100\nAnd it looks like I'm\ndying out right there,\n\n513\n00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.710\nafter my first little virtual router.\n\n514\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.470\nSo, I've got a network issue.\n\n515\n00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:30.620\nWell, I kind of already knew that.\n\n516\n00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.300\nMy laptop's not responding right.\n\n517\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.810\nSo, if I were to go and\ntweak this and try and fix it.\n\n518\n00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.560\nI'm apparently not able to\nget to the Internet, and\n\n519\n00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.700\nI get an idea of where that\nbreaks down right there.\n\n520\n00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.500\nLet me show you and\nexample where it doesn't break down.\n\n521\n00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.260\nActually, my router's finally came up.\n\n522\n00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.232\nSo here's our routing table; we completely\nbreak our continuity in the episode.\n\n523\n00:24:50.232 --> 00:24:51.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But here's our routing table.\n\n524\n00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.560\nWhere we can see the interfaces like\nethernet 3, ethernet 0 and the networks\n\n525\n00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.510\nthat are attached to them so we can\nfigure out who is being routed where.\n\n526\n00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:03.710\nBut what I wanted to show you is a trace\nroute out to like Google for example.\n\n527\n00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.030\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; And there we go.\n\n528\n00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.070\nSo now, when that one reaches out,\nI can see,\n\n529\n00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.260\nI didn't have to pass through\nall that many host to get there.\n\n530\n00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.840\nI hit our router which is in\nthe racks behind me there.\n\n531\n00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.660\nAnd then I jumped over to our\nservice provider, GRU and\n\n532\n00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:21.000\nthen they sent me up to Atlanta where it\nturns out they're paired with Google.\n\n533\n00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.150\nSo I immediately hit Google's network.\n\n534\n00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.990\nAnd then from Google's network,\nthey routed me around some servers and\n\n535\n00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.520\nI finally got to wherever\nit was I was going.\n\n536\n00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.660\nIf I had a problem I could\nspot that problem in here.\n\n537\n00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.900\nNow notice these stars?\n\n538\n00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.390\nThat usually means you hit a firewall and\n\n539\n00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.719\nthe firewall stopping you from doing\nany further research in there.\n\n540\n00:25:36.719 --> 00:25:39.510\nThat happens when a lot of networks\nare tightening up their security.\n\n541\n00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:43.490\nBut at a minimum, I was able to see that\nI made it all the way to Google network.\n\n542\n00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.720\nSo if I'm having a problem connecting\nto them right now then it's a problem\n\n543\n00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.750\non Google's network.\n\n544\n00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I got that far, right?\n\n545\n00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.120\nThat's where this type\nof tool can really help.\n\n546\n00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.070\nAll right, the other two tools\nthat I wanna mention is lookup.\n\n547\n00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.260\nIf you're doing a DNS lookup are you\nactually getting an address so\n\n548\n00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:58.990\nyou can do that.\n\n549\n00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:02.510\nI covered this in one of the earlier\nshows so we can do a lookup and\n\n550\n00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.080\nI'll give you a name to IP.\n\n551\n00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.200\nAnd lastly, the port scans.\n\n552\n00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.940\nSo Daniel mentioned how do we know\nwhat a particular system is running?\n\n553\n00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.357\nHow do I know if it's running FTP or\n\n554\n00:26:12.357 --> 00:26:16.440\nwhatever that you can do\na port scan of a server.\n\n555\n00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.580\nAnd it will try and\nfind what protocols it's running.\n\n556\n00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.220\nAnd so when I scan my server I\ncan see that it's running SSH,\n\n557\n00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.770\nI can see it's running HTTP,\nit's running HTTPs.\n\n558\n00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:31.330\nI can get an idea of some of\nthe different things that it's running.\n\n559\n00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:32.360\nNow be careful with this.\n\n560\n00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.660\nOn your network use the heck out of it,\nright?\n\n561\n00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.510\nBut on the Internet doing a port\nsweep like this is usually\n\n562\n00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.040\nconsidered a reconnoissance attack.\n\n563\n00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.850\nAnd so you'll usually get red-flagged and\nyour communications can get blocked.\n\n564\n00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.720\nSo, you don't wanna use\nit out on the Internet.\n\n565\n00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.130\nBut on your local network it's a great way\nof discovering what services, something is\n\n566\n00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:52.200\nrunning and you'll only discover\na lot more than what you think right?\n\n567\n00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.470\nSo I mean, some of these like afpovertcp.\n\n568\n00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:59.200\nAll right, we know it's running Apple\nfile protocol cuz I got shared folders.\n\n569\n00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.410\nBut it's also running,\nldaps, and Kerberos, right?\n\n570\n00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.670\nThat's part of Apple's Open Directory,\nso I know it's running that.\n\n571\n00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:08.610\nBut it's running 3com-tsmux.\n\n572\n00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.030\nWhat's that?\n\n573\n00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.450\nI actually have no idea.\n\n574\n00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:13.975\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n575\n00:27:13.975 --> 00:27:14.605\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n576\n00:27:14.605 --> 00:27:17.475\nit's a multiplexor of some sort.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's networking\n\n577\n00:27:17.475 --> 00:27:18.485\nright?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n578\n00:27:18.485 --> 00:27:20.425\nyou know it's apparently being used for\nsomething,\n\n579\n00:27:20.425 --> 00:27:23.075\nI have to go and research that.\nWe might find that there's a service\n\n580\n00:27:23.075 --> 00:27:25.170\nthat's running that we don't want running.\n\n581\n00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.910\nOr it might be mislabeled, right?\n\n582\n00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.630\nLike this port might actually\nbe registered to 3com, but\n\n583\n00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:31.240\nApple might be using it for\nsomething else.\n\n584\n00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.850\nBut we can go and research and\nfind out what that is and figure it out.\n\n585\n00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.340\nAnd I'll to research that one,-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n586\n00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.370\n&gt;&gt; I actually don't know what that one is.\n\n587\n00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at the very least,\nif you realize you're not even using it,\n\n588\n00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.500\neven if it's not causing you any problems\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to just leave open\n\n589\n00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.340\nports on your system.\n\n590\n00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.440\nSo for security sake,\nyou can shut it down.\n\n591\n00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, yeah.\n\n592\n00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.070\nSo that's kind of how we go about\nour trouble shooting to find out\n\n593\n00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.760\nwhat's going on.\n\n594\n00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:55.070\nBeyond that, you really, have to kind\nof deal with your customized networks.\n\n595\n00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:58.820\nSo in my case, where I'm plugging in my\nadapter and not getting an IP address.\n\n596\n00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:59.950\nWhat I would do,\n\n597\n00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.700\njust to give you an example of what\nI'm going to do after the show.\n\n598\n00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.043\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Is I would go into my\n\n599\n00:28:05.043 --> 00:28:07.978\nSystem Preferences and\nI would go into Network.\n\n600\n00:28:07.978 --> 00:28:10.621\nAnd I would pull up that\nethernet adaptor and\n\n601\n00:28:10.621 --> 00:28:14.058\nsee, all right,\nI have a manually assigned IP address.\n\n602\n00:28:14.058 --> 00:28:15.890\nBut it wasn't showing up\nin the Network Utility.\n\n603\n00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.960\nSo that means that I'm\nprobably getting a duplicate.\n\n604\n00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.040\nThis IP's probably in use somewhere else.\n\n605\n00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.850\nSo I can switch over to DHTP and\nsee if I get a dynamic address.\n\n606\n00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.060\nRight, and\nthat may solve my problem right there.\n\n607\n00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.140\nAnd now that adapter might start working,\nso I got a dynamic address.\n\n608\n00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.945\nAnd if I go back into\nthe Network Utility and go to Info, and\n\n609\n00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:38.305\nI might have to close it and\nopen it again before it refreshes this.\n\n610\n00:28:38.305 --> 00:28:40.340\nBut still not showing the address there.\n\n611\n00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.260\nSo I'll probably have to close out of it,\nbut now I'm getting that address.\n\n612\n00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.120\nAnd so\nthat connection should be working again.\n\n613\n00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.620\nIf that hadn't worked, my next stop\nwould have been the console, right?\n\n614\n00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.440\nSo if you launch the console application,\nyou can go in to your logs.\n\n615\n00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.765\nAnd I can look into my logs and try and\n\n616\n00:28:55.765 --> 00:28:59.280\nfind what's going on with that network\nconnection, why it's not working.\n\n617\n00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.580\nAnd look for errors in here that\nare related to the network's hub system.\n\n618\n00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.030\nThat would be the next\nstep in troubleshooting.\n\n619\n00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:05.690\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n620\n00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:09.465\nWell, we've covered a lot of resource\nsharing in these three episodes.\n\n621\n00:29:09.465 --> 00:29:10.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We didn't think it was gonna\n\n622\n00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:11.858\ngo that long ladies and gentlemen.\n\n623\n00:29:11.858 --> 00:29:15.228\n[LAUGH] But it's a lot of great\ninformation in there for you to figure out\n\n624\n00:29:15.228 --> 00:29:18.556\nhow to get people to be able to use\nthings that are from your computer.\n\n625\n00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:21.820\nAnd to utilize resources\nfrom their computer as well.\n\n626\n00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.680\nAnd then, worse comes to worse,\na little troubleshooting thrown on for\n\n627\n00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.420\ngood measure.\n\n628\n00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.410\nDon, we do thank you for\nyour insight on these topics.\n\n629\n00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.440\nWe thank our audience for watching but\nlooking at that clock, yeah,\n\n630\n00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.500\nit's run out yet again.\n\n631\n00:29:32.500

00:00:06.243\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.243 --> 00:00:08.133\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:11.866\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.563\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:17.691\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:21.933\nAnd in today's episode, we are coming\nback at you with more of our ACSP series.\n\n10\n00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:25.850\nAnd of course, joining us in studio\nagain is our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.700\nDon, we're glad to have you again,\nhow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.580\n&gt;&gt; Hey, glad to be back, and\n\n13\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.470\nready to dive into a new section of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n14\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.570\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at peripheral devices,\n\n15\n00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.980\nwhich are kind of a hot\nbutton in the news right now.\n\n16\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.880\nWith the New MacBooks that came out\nthat only have USB-C ports on them,\n\n17\n00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.850\npeople are talking about\nperipherals a lot.\n\n18\n00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.411\nSo in this episode,\nwe're gonna discuss that.\n\n19\n00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.813\nWe'll take a look at some of the different\noptions and things we have available.\n\n20\n00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:51.180\nAnd some of the different types of\nperipherals you'll encounter out there in\n\n21\n00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.702\nthe real world, as you support the now\nquite various arrangement of peripherals\n\n22\n00:00:54.702 --> 00:00:56.340\nthat are supported in the Mac world.\n\n23\n00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.960\nSo quite a bit to get through, but\n\n24\n00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.470\nI think we can tackle it\nright here in this episode.\n\n25\n00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.150\n&gt;&gt; That's right, like Don said, plenty of\nperipherals from which to choose from.\n\n26\n00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.430\nDifferent ways in which\nwe can connect them.\n\n27\n00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.170\nIt's a laundry list, a litany,\n\n28\n00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.040\nif you would, of different things that\nwe need to run down in this episode.\n\n29\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.895\nAnd apparently you can't just jam one\ninto the other, that doesn't work.\n\n30\n00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:18.700\nIt causes fires, there's insurance and\nlawsuits and things of that nature.\n\n31\n00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.870\nSo Don, you're here today to help us\nput them in their proper categories.\n\n32\n00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.420\nWhere should we start?\n\n33\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.760\nShould we begin with what\nperipherals are available?\n\n34\n00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, let's start there because\nthings have changed a lot, right.\n\n35\n00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.127\nBack in the day, right, I remember I used\nto have this G4 Mac that was awesome.\n\n36\n00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:36.423\nI mean, it was a full on tower.\n\n37\n00:01:36.423 --> 00:01:38.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt looked like a stinking spaceship.\n\n38\n00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.060\nAnd you could pop open the cover and\nyou could add more hard drives.\n\n39\n00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.730\nYou could upgrade the video card,\nyou could add more memory.\n\n40\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.670\nYou could add things you needed\nto it because it was big [LAUGH].\n\n41\n00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.999\nIt had the room for\nthat and it was awesome.\n\n42\n00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.460\nNow, you go and you buy a Mac Pro, right,\n\n43\n00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.650\nthe most expensive computer available from\nApple, and it’s shaped like a trashcan.\n\n44\n00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.300\nAnd there’s no extra room in\nthere to add much of anything.\n\n45\n00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.946\nApple has done a great job\nat micronization, right,\n\n46\n00:02:04.946 --> 00:02:06.654\nmaking things smaller.\n\n47\n00:02:06.654 --> 00:02:09.424\nJust look at the MacBook Air to see how\nmuch smaller can you get before you're\n\n48\n00:02:09.424 --> 00:02:11.508\nholding a piece of paper and\nsaying that's your laptop?\n\n49\n00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:12.204\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n50\n00:02:12.204 --> 00:02:14.065\n[LAUGH] It's really, really small.\n\n51\n00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:19.365\nOn a positive side, that makes\nthe devices light, and portable, and\n\n52\n00:02:19.365 --> 00:02:23.685\nusually more energy efficient, and you can\nkinda get them out of sight, out of mind.\n\n53\n00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:25.770\nAnd it's a great aesthetic.\n\n54\n00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.510\nOn a negative side, it means that when you\nbuy the device, it can only come with so\n\n55\n00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.390\nmuch functionality.\n\n56\n00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.860\nAnd they try and provide\nthe functionality that most of us need.\n\n57\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.610\nThings like video cuz we need that, right?\n\n58\n00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; A little bit of storage,\n\n59\n00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.300\nnetwork connectivity, typically wireless,\nright, sometimes only wireless.\n\n60\n00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.020\nIn my laptop,\n\n61\n00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.800\nthe only network connectivity it\ncame with is wireless connectivity.\n\n62\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.615\nSo they're trying to hit the most\ncommon denominator of the masses,\n\n63\n00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:51.942\nwhat everybody needs.\n\n64\n00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:56.445\nBut inevitably there's gonna be something\nthat you need that's different than\n\n65\n00:02:56.445 --> 00:02:57.646\nthe masses, right.\n\n66\n00:02:57.646 --> 00:03:00.938\nAnd I run into that all the time,\nwhere when I'm on the show,\n\n67\n00:03:00.938 --> 00:03:03.160\nI want a physical network connection.\n\n68\n00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.330\nI wanna plug in an RJ45 connector and\nfeel it click, and\n\n69\n00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.300\nget my link lights and\nknow I've got that gigabit connection.\n\n70\n00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.434\nThat's what I want.\n\n71\n00:03:11.434 --> 00:03:15.841\nOr I might be in my office, and\nI want to record a video source, so\n\n72\n00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:18.307\nI need to take video into my laptop.\n\n73\n00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:21.210\nInstead of sending video out,\nI need to be bringing video in.\n\n74\n00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.730\nWell, those things are not\nsupported in the basic model, so\n\n75\n00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.750\nwe have to go with peripherals.\n\n76\n00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.320\nAnd peripherals come in\na wide arrangement of things.\n\n77\n00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.920\nAnd before the show, Daniel was making\nfun of me because I've jammed so\n\n78\n00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.270\nmuch stuff in this podium right now.\n\n79\n00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.790\nI was just grabbing things, right.\n\n80\n00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.870\nOn my laptop, it's got a touch pad and\nit's got a keyboard.\n\n81\n00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.830\nAnd when I'm sitting right here with\nmy laptop, that works out great.\n\n82\n00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.080\nBut on the laptop my screen\nis only a 13 inch screen.\n\n83\n00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.060\nI might want a bigger screen so\nI hook it up to a bigger monitor.\n\n84\n00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.880\nWhen I go into my office,\nI hook it up to a bigger monitor.\n\n85\n00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.430\nWell, if I'm hooked up\nto a bigger monitor,\n\n86\n00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.710\nI don't wanna be typing on my little\nlaptop keyboard and touchpad.\n\n87\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.390\nAnd so I have an external keyboard and\ntouchpad.\n\n88\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.650\nAnd so let me whip out a few of the\nperipherals that I use on a regular basis.\n\n89\n00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.116\nSo here's my keyboard and\nmagic trackpad, whatever it's called.\n\n90\n00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:10.764\nSo this sits at my desk.\n\n91\n00:04:10.764 --> 00:04:14.187\nAnd when I'm in my office, I can use\na full sized keyboard that really,\n\n92\n00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:18.660\nat the end of the day, isn't all that much\nbigger than what's in the laptop, itself.\n\n93\n00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.800\nBut I'm able to get a little\nmore functionality out of it and\n\n94\n00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.410\nhave the larger touchpad.\n\n95\n00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that touchpad's a good size.\n\n96\n00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.170\n&gt;&gt; And I also use a video adapter, right.\n\n97\n00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.820\nSo this is a display port on one end.\n\n98\n00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.090\nAnd this one's DVI,\nthe one in my office is actually HDMI.\n\n99\n00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.940\nThat runs into my monitor in there to be\nable to connect up to that bigger monitor.\n\n100\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.337\nNow, there is an HDMI port on the laptop\nthat you can use on this one, but\n\n101\n00:04:44.337 --> 00:04:45.040\nnot on every one.\n\n102\n00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.810\nIf you get the new MacBook Pro,\nit only has USB-C ports.\n\n103\n00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.020\nThere's no video out at all\nunless you go USB-C to video, so\n\n104\n00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.970\nyou would need adapters like this.\n\n105\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.880\nSo sometimes a peripheral is really\njust a dongle that then runs to\n\n106\n00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.840\nthe peripheral, itself.\n\n107\n00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.240\nI mean, we may need this.\n\n108\n00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.710\nWith a device like this keyboard, well,\nit can use Bluetooth and connect so\n\n109\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.560\nI don't have to have a dongle for\nthat, right.\n\n110\n00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.682\nBut some thing's do require it.\n\n111\n00:05:08.682 --> 00:05:09.443\nOther things that I have.\n\n112\n00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:14.930\nWhen I sit down at my desk I have storage,\nright, my Time Machine drive.\n\n113\n00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.260\nThis drive is connected when\nmy laptop is at my desk.\n\n114\n00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.710\nAnd it backs up to Time Machine once\nan hour, and backs that up and saves it.\n\n115\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.670\nWe covered that in\nthe Time Machine episodes.\n\n116\n00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.270\nSo that's another peripheral,\nadding storage.\n\n117\n00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.909\nI mentioned inputting video.\n\n118\n00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:32.091\nRight, if I want to record video onto\nmy laptop, we're gonna do a podcast or\n\n119\n00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:35.705\nsomething like that, I've got this little\nguy, which I'm gonna hold upside down.\n\n120\n00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:38.991\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This little guy, which takes HDMI or\n\n121\n00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:42.990\nSDI signal in, and\nthen converts it to Thunderbolt, so\n\n122\n00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.760\nI can run it into my laptop and record it,\nso I can record HD video on my device.\n\n123\n00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.410\nThis is functionality that\nis not in any Apple product,\n\n124\n00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.115\nfrom the Mac Pro all the way down\nto the Mac Mini or whatever.\n\n125\n00:05:56.115 --> 00:06:00.555\nNone of them have video in, or video\ncapture, or whatever you wanna call it.\n\n126\n00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:02.396\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So these little boxes are really handy\n\n127\n00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:04.778\nfor that, to be able to record\nthat kind of information.\n\n128\n00:06:04.778 --> 00:06:10.070\nl know in another episode,\nwe used the SuperDrive, right.\n\n129\n00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.559\nNo Macs come with optical drives anymore.\n\n130\n00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:15.780\nSo if you need an optical drive, you can\nget a super disk like this, or SuperDrive,\n\n131\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.587\nor whatever we want to call it,\nand plug it in.\n\n132\n00:06:17.587 --> 00:06:21.760\nAnd now we've got extra connectivity\nthere, so that's another peripheral.\n\n133\n00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.510\nI dropped something on the floor,\nso that must not be too important.\n\n134\n00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.550\nWhat else do we have?\n\n135\n00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.880\nI've got all sorts of stuff here.\n\n136\n00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.330\nLet's say I've got a new Mac Pro,\nright, or a Macbook Pro,\n\n137\n00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.930\nwith the USB-C ports, right, and\nI want a physical network jack.\n\n138\n00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.090\nWell, it doesn't have an RJ45 connector\nto be able to plug in for that network.\n\n139\n00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.170\nIt just has USB-C.\n\n140\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.880\nSo here's an example of another dongle.\n\n141\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.940\nThis is a third party one.\n\n142\n00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.931\nI think everything I've shown,\nnot everything, I guess,\n\n143\n00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:46.502\nsome of this is Apple stuff,\nsome of it isn't.\n\n144\n00:06:46.502 --> 00:06:47.308\nThis is third party.\n\n145\n00:06:47.308 --> 00:06:53.300\nBut it's USB-C on one end and\nstandard RJ45 network jack on the other.\n\n146\n00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.160\nWe can pop this on, and this is adding\na network adapter to my system.\n\n147\n00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.297\nIt looks like a dongle, but\n\n148\n00:06:58.297 --> 00:07:00.730\nyou're actually adding network\nhardware to the system.\n\n149\n00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.900\nSo this is the peripheral, itself.\n\n150\n00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.410\nAnd you plug in the network, and\nyou're off and ready to hit the network.\n\n151\n00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.880\nSo these kind of things are really\nessential if you've got some\n\n152\n00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.880\nspecialized need that deviates from what\nthe standard needs of a user would be.\n\n153\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.450\nAnd right now Apple dictates\nwho the standard user is.\n\n154\n00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.270\nAnd that may not actually match what\nyou've got, which is why we're doing\n\n155\n00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.820\nthis episode here on all the different\ntypes of peripherals that we might have.\n\n156\n00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.720\nNow, I've shown you several\ndifferent examples here.\n\n157\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.260\nThere are other things, some that are\nreally old and not used so much anymore,\n\n158\n00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.010\nlike modems.\n\n159\n00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.625\nWe used to stick those on\nthe back of computers.\n\n160\n00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:37.407\nHopefully, you're not using\ndial-up anymore at all.\n\n161\n00:07:37.407 --> 00:07:41.508\nThere's any number of\ncrazy proprietary devices.\n\n162\n00:07:41.508 --> 00:07:44.220\nPrinters, we'll talk about\nprinters in a separate episode.\n\n163\n00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.710\nBut there's things like that you\nmight wanna add on to your device.\n\n164\n00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.240\nI know on my desk, if I just in my head\nrun through the things that I have.\n\n165\n00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.946\nI have a dedicated webcam that's a higher\nquality than the one that's built in to\n\n166\n00:07:53.946 --> 00:07:54.557\nthe laptop.\n\n167\n00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.969\nI have a speaker microphone,\none of those pucks that is, again,\n\n168\n00:07:57.969 --> 00:08:01.149\na higher quality than the one\nthat's built into the device.\n\n169\n00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:05.255\nSo that's an example of where I have the\nperipherals already built into my system,\n\n170\n00:08:05.255 --> 00:08:08.530\nbut I use external ones because\nI can get better ones, right?\n\n171\n00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.090\nOnes that work a little better\nthan what's built in the system.\n\n172\n00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.235\nSo it's up to you what peripherals you're\ngonna support, but in the field you're\n\n173\n00:08:15.235 --> 00:08:19.190\ngonna encounter many Mac users that\nhave added tons of different hardware.\n\n174\n00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.987\nAnd you've got to make sure\nthat can work with macOS.\n\n175\n00:08:20.987 --> 00:08:22.849\nAnd that's usually the challenge.\n\n176\n00:08:22.849 --> 00:08:26.350\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, when we come to talking\nabout peripherals, right, it's nice.\n\n177\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.933\nOkay, great, I need to expand\nmy functionality of my computer.\n\n178\n00:08:28.933 --> 00:08:35.201\nLet me just get this peripheral, I'll plug\nit in, and it works sometimes, right?\n\n179\n00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:37.410\nBecause when you plug something in,\n\n180\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:42.280\nthere has to be that software layer\nthat says this is how this device works.\n\n181\n00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.120\nAnd that, sometimes,\nis built in and sometimes is not.\n\n182\n00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.860\nAnd this opens the world of drivers,\nright?\n\n183\n00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.860\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, if I take something like\na hard drive, my Time Machine disk.\n\n184\n00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.403\nWell, it's a standard hard drive,\nand this one's USB 3.\n\n185\n00:08:53.403 --> 00:08:57.740\nAnd I plug it into a USB 3 port of I\nhave it, or USB-C if I've got that.\n\n186\n00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.805\nYou plug it in, and it works, right?\n\n187\n00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:02.230\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; macOS recognizes the hard drive,\n\n188\n00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.250\nif it's a file system that's supported.\n\n189\n00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.770\nMine's actually formatted\nMac OS Extended (Journaled).\n\n190\n00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.150\nIt recognizes it, and\nit goes, and that's that.\n\n191\n00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.650\nNo drivers involved,\nit just works right out of the box.\n\n192\n00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.870\nAnd for a lot of hardware,\nyou'll find that.\n\n193\n00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:21.180\nKeyboards, mice, USB storage,\nnetwork adapters, video adapters.\n\n194\n00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.600\nMost of the time they're\ngonna work without drivers.\n\n195\n00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.050\nBut when you start getting into things\nthat are a little more advanced, for\n\n196\n00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.820\nexample, my little video capture box here,\nright?\n\n197\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.000\nThis is a little more advanced.\n\n198\n00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.410\nThe system needs to understand\nthat video is coming in.\n\n199\n00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.260\nAnd know how to handle that, and\nknow how to talk to this device.\n\n200\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.180\nAnd that's not built into\nthe operating system.\n\n201\n00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:39.940\nIf I were to take this and\n\n202\n00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.100\njust plug it right into Daniel's laptop,\nit wouldn't work, right?\n\n203\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.335\nThe system would recognize that\nyou plugged something in, but\n\n204\n00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.401\nit wouldn't know what it is.\n\n205\n00:09:46.401 --> 00:09:50.940\nIt wouldn't know what to do with it,\nso for that, we need to load a driver.\n\n206\n00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.639\nSo when you have a peripheral that you're\nadding, it's always a good idea to check\n\n207\n00:09:53.639 --> 00:09:55.350\nthe vendor's website to\nlook if they have a driver.\n\n208\n00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.230\nSo for example, this is made by\na company called Blackmagic, right.\n\n209\n00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.845\nAnd if I go to Blackmagic's website,\nI can go to their support page.\n\n210\n00:10:02.845 --> 00:10:07.249\nAnd you'll see where they have drivers for\nall of their various products.\n\n211\n00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:11.108\nAnd what I've got is their Capture and\nPlayback device, so I've selected that.\n\n212\n00:10:11.108 --> 00:10:16.002\nAnd if I scroll down, here is a software\nupdate they've got for Desktop Video 10.9.\n\n213\n00:10:16.002 --> 00:10:19.650\nThis is what supports\nthe UltraStudio HD Mini recorder,\n\n214\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.840\nwhich is what I've got\nright here in my hand.\n\n215\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.158\nSo that's the driver,\nand I can download it.\n\n216\n00:10:25.158 --> 00:10:28.400\nThey've got a driver for Windows,\na driver for Linux, a driver for Mac OS.\n\n217\n00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.810\nSo I can come in and\nI can choose this to download it.\n\n218\n00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.570\nAnd once I download that driver,\nI need to install it.\n\n219\n00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.520\nWell, the driver, I know we talked\nabout this in an earlier episode.\n\n220\n00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.166\nDrivers are typically distributed\nas a PKG file, right, as a package.\n\n221\n00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:46.550\nAnd I know that it says that it's\na zip here, but when we open it,\n\n222\n00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.135\nthat'll turn out to be a pkg.\n\n223\n00:10:48.135 --> 00:10:49.611\nLet me just let it finish downloading,\nit'll be a pkg.\n\n224\n00:10:49.611 --> 00:10:55.505\nAnd you run it, and it'll install\nthe driver in the backend, all right?\n\n225\n00:10:55.505 --> 00:10:58.165\nNow I've already got the driver on\nmy system because I do actually\n\n226\n00:10:58.165 --> 00:10:59.225\nuse this thing.\n\n227\n00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:02.535\nSo when I fire it up here,\nlet me just open this up.\n\n228\n00:11:02.535 --> 00:11:04.775\nSo I'm opening the archive\nthat I just downloaded.\n\n229\n00:11:04.775 --> 00:11:08.868\nAnd right here,\nInstall Desktop Video 10.9.pkg, right?\n\n230\n00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:13.360\nSo you'll double-click on that, and it'll\ninstall the driver for this recorder.\n\n231\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.080\nNow once the driver's installed,\nhow do you interact with it?\n\n232\n00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.690\nOn some devices, you don't,\nyou install the driver, and that's it.\n\n233\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:24.120\nIt just hides in the background,\nyou never see it, and it works.\n\n234\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.270\nOther ones, though, like this one,\nif I go into my System Preferences.\n\n235\n00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.950\nIn my System Preferences,\nI'll see the Blackmagic Desktop Video.\n\n236\n00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.640\nThis little bottom section of your\nSystem Preferences is the custom section.\n\n237\n00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.172\nSo any custom drivers and\n\n238\n00:11:37.172 --> 00:11:40.330\nsoftware you install will always be\nadded on down here at the bottom.\n\n239\n00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.900\nAnd so you can see the driver\nfrom Blackmagic right there.\n\n240\n00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.300\nAnd if I click on it,\nI get No Desktop Video Device Detected.\n\n241\n00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:51.064\nWell, probably because I haven't\nplugged it in, so let's [CROSSTALK]\n\n242\n00:11:51.064 --> 00:11:52.482\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that might help, Ron.\n\n243\n00:11:52.482 --> 00:11:54.618\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n244\n00:11:54.618 --> 00:11:56.887\njust add in a quick cable here.\n\n245\n00:11:56.887 --> 00:12:02.126\nAnd once I plug that in, [SOUND] I'm\nactually out of Thunderbolt ports.\n\n246\n00:12:02.126 --> 00:12:04.730\nSo let me unplug that one.\n\n247\n00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.000\nThat's one challenge you run into with\nperipherals is you can run out of ports.\n\n248\n00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.472\nIn which case, you have to introduce hubs,\nI'll talk about those in a moment.\n\n249\n00:12:10.472 --> 00:12:14.760\nSo I'm gonna plug that in, and I might\nhave to relaunch, nope, there we go.\n\n250\n00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.076\nSo it recognized it,\nit sees that Mini Recorder.\n\n251\n00:12:17.076 --> 00:12:20.309\nAnd from here I can choose whether\nI'm taking the video in from HDMI or\n\n252\n00:12:20.309 --> 00:12:22.000\nwhether I'm taking in it from SDI.\n\n253\n00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.300\nI can pick what that source is and\nget it configured.\n\n254\n00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.610\nAnd I can work with that device,\nnow it's supported in other things, right?\n\n255\n00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.300\nSo this type of functionality\nrequires a driver to be installed.\n\n256\n00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.260\nIf I didn't have the driver,\nthis would not work.\n\n257\n00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.630\nWell, the driver, itself,\ninstalls by running that pkg,\n\n258\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.980\nI don't have to mess with it.\n\n259\n00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.620\nBut if you ever need to figure out where\nit went, if you, for example, want to see.\n\n260\n00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.510\nYou could drop into a terminal, and\nthey go to a couple of different places.\n\n261\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.187\nUsually, you'll find them\nin /Library/Extensions/.\n\n262\n00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:55.270\nThat's the most common place for\na driver to deposit itself.\n\n263\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.690\nAnd so if I look in there and\n\n264\n00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:01.900\nsee, sure enough, here is three\nBlackmagic kernel extensions, right?\n\n265\n00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.067\nBlackmagicIO, that's\ninput/output kernel extension.\n\n266\n00:13:05.067 --> 00:13:08.106\nThen there's BlackmagicUsbIO,\nI'm not plugged in via USB,\n\n267\n00:13:08.106 --> 00:13:09.436\nso I'm not using that one.\n\n268\n00:13:09.436 --> 00:13:12.160\nAnd then Blackmagic_Multibridge_Driver.\n\n269\n00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.340\nSo that's if we're connected\nvia Thunderbolt, usually.\n\n270\n00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.290\nSo you may install more than one driver\neven for a product you don't have, right?\n\n271\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:24.647\nBlackmagic has one video driver for\nall of their recorders.\n\n272\n00:13:24.647 --> 00:13:26.660\nThey got like nine\ndifferent capture devices.\n\n273\n00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.460\nSo I've installed drivers\nthat I don't need here, but\n\n274\n00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.760\nthat's okay cuz they only activate when\nyou plug in the appropriate device.\n\n275\n00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.570\nSo this BlackmagicUsbIO, I'm not really\nworried about that being there even\n\n276\n00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:37.990\nthough I don't have the USB device.\n\n277\n00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.200\nBut if I were to plug one in the future,\nit would see that and\n\n278\n00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.030\nwork, and off you go.\n\n279\n00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.439\nYou see some of the other\ncontrollers that I've got.\n\n280\n00:13:43.439 --> 00:13:46.370\nReally important ones like my\nwireless Xbox 360 controller.\n\n281\n00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.331\nGot to have that working.\n\n282\n00:13:47.331 --> 00:13:48.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you do.\n[LAUGH]\n\n283\n00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.400\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a critical thing.\n\n284\n00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.260\nNot supported by the base\noperating system,\n\n285\n00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.900\nbut I've added the driver for that.\n\n286\n00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.380\nSo you can install those, do be careful.\n\n287\n00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:00.440\nWhen you install drivers, the vendors who\nmanufacture them can digitally sign them.\n\n288\n00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.030\nAnd that way you know they\nhaven't been tampered with.\n\n289\n00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:08.290\nIf you go and download a driver from\nsome third party, and it's not signed,\n\n290\n00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.140\nthey didn't sign that driver, macOS will\nactually stop you from installing it.\n\n291\n00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.460\nAnd you can override that.\n\n292\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.290\nYou can actually choose to disable\nSystem Integrity Protection and\n\n293\n00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.370\nget that installed.\n\n294\n00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:21.350\nBut the reason it's being blocked\nis that if there's a virus or\n\n295\n00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:25.820\nmalware of some sort in the driver,\nthe driver is executed as the root user.\n\n296\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.030\nIt has full access to your system,\n\n297\n00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.110\neven after it's been decrypted\nfrom FileVault when you log in.\n\n298\n00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.230\nAnd so\nthat means encryption doesn't stop it.\n\n299\n00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.930\nIt has access to everything,\nit can do some real damage.\n\n300\n00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.750\nSo that's why we only allow\nsigned drivers on macOS.\n\n301\n00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.113\nAnd you don't want to disable that\neven though you certainly could.\n\n302\n00:14:43.113 --> 00:14:47.030\nAll right, there's a few other\nplaces these things could end.\n\n303\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.980\nFor example, there's some that\ncome with the system, with macOS.\n\n304\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:56.940\nIf you look in /System/Library/Extensions,\nyou'll see some other ones here.\n\n305\n00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.220\nThese are typically ones\nthat were created by Apple.\n\n306\n00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.339\nAnd so you won't normally see things\nget added on here, it'd be pretty rare.\n\n307\n00:15:02.339 --> 00:15:04.803\nBut stuff like the iPod driver,\nif I connect my iPod.\n\n308\n00:15:04.803 --> 00:15:07.966\nI can't remember the last\ntime I had an iPod.\n\n309\n00:15:07.966 --> 00:15:09.551\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if we're ever in a time warp, and\n\n310\n00:15:09.551 --> 00:15:12.580\nwe need to plug in that iPod and\nget it to work, the driver's right there.\n\n311\n00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.490\nWe can get it and go.\n\n312\n00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.030\nBut some are more important,\nlike cd9660, which is the driver for\n\n313\n00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.700\nthe file system used on most CDs.\n\n314\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.940\nSo if I plug in my SuperDrive, and\n\n315\n00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.730\nI plug a CD in, I need that\ndriver to be able to access it.\n\n316\n00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.540\nOr the ntfs driver,\nwhich is letting me see\n\n317\n00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.170\nhard drives that are formatted with the NT\nfile system that comes over from Windows.\n\n318\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.030\nI'd be able to work with those.\n\n319\n00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.990\nSo that's kinda where these things are,\nand they're just dynamically loaded.\n\n320\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.440\nAs we plug stuff in, they go active.\n\n321\n00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.320\nIf I unplug a device that was using\na kernel extension, it gets deactivated.\n\n322\n00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.030\nSo it's not wasting memory or resources.\n\n323\n00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.610\nDon't worry if you have\na ton of things in here.\n\n324\n00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.180\nDon't think it's slowing down your system.\n\n325\n00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.190\nThey only go active when\nthat hardware is attached.\n\n326\n00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.450\nAll right, some of the other things that\nwe need to think about is that normally\n\n327\n00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:56.060\ndrivers come as a package like that, but\nsometimes they're included with software.\n\n328\n00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.493\nSo you install some kind of\nthird-party software, and\n\n329\n00:15:58.493 --> 00:15:59.899\nthe driver comes along with it.\n\n330\n00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:02.718\nI've got a program that\nI use called Serial.\n\n331\n00:16:02.718 --> 00:16:06.781\nAnd Serial is what I use to\ncommunicate with Serial Devices,\n\n332\n00:16:06.781 --> 00:16:09.981\nlike Cisco routers if I\nwant to configure them.\n\n333\n00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:14.410\nIt actually includes drivers for\ncertain USB to serial port adaptors.\n\n334\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.250\nAnd it's actually built into the software.\n\n335\n00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:20.500\nSo sometimes a driver will come along\nwith the program, other times it won't.\n\n336\n00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.930\nAnd you'll see like my Airconsole\nsoftware is being supported there.\n\n337\n00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.469\nThat's software built into\nthe serial application.\n\n338\n00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:32.300\nNow with most drivers these days we\ndon't have to worry about this, but\n\n339\n00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.650\nremember that Mac OS is a 64 bit operating\nsystem, and it wasn't always that way.\n\n340\n00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:40.260\nIt used to be a 32 bit operating system,\nand so the drivers were 32 bit.\n\n341\n00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.830\nAnd when the Mac OS switches to 64 bit,\ndrivers had to be redone.\n\n342\n00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:48.360\nAnd so if you're supporting older Macs,\nyou may have a challenge finding a driver\n\n343\n00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.940\nthat's the right bits,\nright, the 32 versus 64 bit.\n\n344\n00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.340\nWell, a lot of energists\npackage them together, so\n\n345\n00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:59.350\nwhen you download one driver, it's got\nthe 32 bit and 64 bit package together.\n\n346\n00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.700\nBut some don't, they may separate that\nout, and you'll that a lot when you go and\n\n347\n00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.710\ndownload software where they have\noptions for downloading 64 and 32 bit.\n\n348\n00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.000\nFor example,\n\n349\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.910\ntrying to think of a good example\noff hand, I think Haroopad, does it.\n\n350\n00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.200\nWhere Haroopad is a little text editor and\nif you go and\n\n351\n00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.380\ndownload it I think they actually\nseparate out, I might be wrong.\n\n352\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.000\nIt looks like I'm,\nyeah I'm wrong on that one.\n\n353\n00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.540\nAll right, well some of them do separate\nout, I mean you can see where they\n\n354\n00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.710\nare separating that here for\nWindows like 32 and 64 bit.\n\n355\n00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.120\nYou'll see the same thing for Mac,\nsometimes where they separate those out.\n\n356\n00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.840\nAnd so when you download drivers,\n\n357\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.980\nyou've got to look to make sure\nyou're getting the right bit rate.\n\n358\n00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.380\nAlmost everybody has 64-bit these days and\nso you just download the 64-bit\n\n359\n00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.190\nversion and that's the one it's\ngonna work on any modern Mac.\n\n360\n00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.370\nBut if you've got older Macs,\nyou may need to double check that.\n\n361\n00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:42.870\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n362\n00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:46.720\nSo we've kind of talked about\nthe different peripherals that we have.\n\n363\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.260\nMaybe the architecture,\nthe driver is involved.\n\n364\n00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.000\nBut we also have to worry\nabout connectivity.\n\n365\n00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.540\nHow do I actually get the thing connected.\n\n366\n00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:58.480\nYou had the little black magic thing that\nlooked like it was maybe USB to whatever,\n\n367\n00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.845\nmaybe a Thunderbolt or\nsomething like that.\n\n368\n00:18:01.845 --> 00:18:02.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that was Thunderbolt.\n\n369\n00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.600\n&gt;&gt; And that is how it connected.\n\n370\n00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.920\nBut there's a ton of different\nconnectivity methods\n\n371\n00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.040\nwhen it comes to peripherals, correct?\n\n372\n00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.940\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah, if you take your\nMac and go into About This Mac, right?\n\n373\n00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.370\nSo I'm gonna hit my Apple menu and\ngo to About This Mac.\n\n374\n00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:19.790\nAnd in the About This Mac screen,\nyou can go into your System Report.\n\n375\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.140\nAnd inside of your System Report,\nyou'll see a list of your hardware.\n\n376\n00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.700\nAnd it's listing all the different\nways that you can connect hardware.\n\n377\n00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.980\nAnd what it's really talking\nabout are peripherals.\n\n378\n00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.190\nYou've got your internal stuff.\n\n379\n00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:32.000\nYou can't change that, right?\n\n380\n00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.350\nSo the peripherals are what you change.\n\n381\n00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.350\nAnd you'll see things that are really\ncommon like USB and Thunderbolt.\n\n382\n00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.470\nWe know those.\n\n383\n00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.130\nRight?\nThose are pretty common.\n\n384\n00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.460\nBut there's other ones in here that\nyou might not have ever heard of.\n\n385\n00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.690\nLike fiber channel or\nsome of the older stuff like ATA.\n\n386\n00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.920\nAnd we look at that and\nI'm like, what the heck is that?\n\n387\n00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.660\nAnd you click on it, and\nyou'll see a message,\n\n388\n00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.910\nthe computer doesn't\ncontain any ATA devices.\n\n389\n00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.340\nWell we've got support for them,\nwe just aren't using them.\n\n390\n00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.620\nSo when you go to connect a peripheral,\n\n391\n00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:00.470\nyou've got wide support of a number\nof different technologies.\n\n392\n00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.830\nNow when you plug in,\nif it's one of these supported bus types,\n\n393\n00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:04.850\nthen the system will detect it.\n\n394\n00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:05.890\nIt doesn't mean it'll work, right?\n\n395\n00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.470\nYou still need the kernel extension,\nthe driver for that hardware.\n\n396\n00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.860\nBut at least this means it'll be detected.\n\n397\n00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.340\nIf I've got something\nthat isn't in this list,\n\n398\n00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.470\nI probably won't even have\na port to be able to plug it in.\n\n399\n00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.440\nAnd if I can't even plug it in,\nthen it's kind of hard to use it.\n\n400\n00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.829\nNow, I don't want to bore us to death\nby going through each of these.\n\n401\n00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:24.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll put it in the show notes\n\n402\n00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.410\nwhere it explains all the different\ntypes of connections that you might\n\n403\n00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:27.300\nencounter out there.\n\n404\n00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.730\nBut just to rundown them quickly so we can\nunderstand which ones are the best and\n\n405\n00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.070\nwhich ones aren't,\n\n406\n00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.080\nwe've got our handful that I wanna\nhighlight here like Bluetooth.\n\n407\n00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.890\nBluetooth is a wireless technology that\nallows short range communications and\n\n408\n00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.280\nit's designed really to connect devices\ntogether not to get access the internet\n\n409\n00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.460\nbut to have my phone send\na photo to my laptop.\n\n410\n00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.670\nOr to transfer a file from my\nlaptop to Daniel's laptop.\n\n411\n00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.910\nOr to connect to a printer that's\nsitting right there on my desk.\n\n412\n00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:53.650\nThat's what Bluetooth\nis really designed for.\n\n413\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.730\n&gt;&gt; Put headphones on your iPhone.\n\n414\n00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you have the new\niPhone with no headphone jack,\n\n415\n00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.090\nyou kinda need Bluetooth for that.\n\n416\n00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.250\nBluetooth is not very fast.\n\n417\n00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:05.760\nIt's designed for a short range\ncommunications at a reasonable speed.\n\n418\n00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.550\nThe newest version of Bluetooth that is\ndirectly supported right now is Bluetooth\n\n419\n00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:14.640\nversion 4 and\nit gives support up to, well, shoot.\n\n420\n00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.790\nBluetooth version 4, when it's in low\nenergy mode, it's actually really,\n\n421\n00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:18.450\nreally slow.\n\n422\n00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.850\nIt's up to 200 kilobits per second,\nwhich is not a lot of data.\n\n423\n00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.930\nBut when it's running at normal speed\nit's up to 24 megabits of information.\n\n424\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.820\nSo 24 megs is not incredibly fast, but\n\n425\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.000\nI mean it's faster than like\nthe modems back in the old day.\n\n426\n00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.020\nBut your average network connections these\ndays are 100 megabits, so 24 megabits is\n\n427\n00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.910\na quarter if that speed that you would\nget going over a regular network.\n\n428\n00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.129\nSo it's not something when you use\nregularly except something for\n\n429\n00:20:42.129 --> 00:20:45.635\nlike headphones or my keyboard or\nmouse, these things use bluetooth and\n\n430\n00:20:45.635 --> 00:20:48.223\n24 megabit is way more that\nwe need to communicate,\n\n431\n00:20:48.223 --> 00:20:49.724\nI just press the H key,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n\n432\n00:20:49.724 --> 00:20:50.850\n&gt;&gt; I don't need much more.\n\n433\n00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.200\nI keyboard's actually active.\n\n434\n00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.020\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you pressed the h key.\n\n435\n00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.087\n&gt;&gt; and yeah, I pressed the h key.\n\n436\n00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's Bluetooth,\n\n437\n00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:00.850\ndo know that there are multiple versions\nof Bluetooth, so they can be faster.\n\n438\n00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.230\nAnd if I choose a device that's running,\nlike this is the actual antenna here.\n\n439\n00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.190\nDo I have anything paired?\n\n440\n00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.130\nHere, here's like my\nkeyboard that's paired.\n\n441\n00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:11.170\nAnd you can look down and see information\nabout it, that its connected, and what\n\n442\n00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.490\nthe battery level of that device is and\nso on, there's my track pad showing up.\n\n443\n00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.000\nAnd so you get an idea of how well they're\nworking, whether they're connected.\n\n444\n00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.410\nAnd that's how Bluetooth\nkinda does it's work.\n\n445\n00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.360\nThe other type of connection is,\nwe'll jump around a bit here.\n\n446\n00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.070\nOld school parallel SCSI, right?\n\n447\n00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:33.738\nOld Macs, and I'm talking old like\nPower PC Macs, use SCSI hard drives.\n\n448\n00:21:33.738 --> 00:21:36.610\nS-C-S-A, or S-C-S-I.\n\n449\n00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.400\nIt stands for small computer system\ninterface, I had to look at my notes for\n\n450\n00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.325\nthat cuz it's been a long time\nsince I've had to say it out.\n\n451\n00:21:42.325 --> 00:21:48.915\nBut SCSI, it was a great technology, it's\nlargely been replaced by other things.\n\n452\n00:21:48.915 --> 00:21:52.945\nSAS is Serial Attached SCSI,\nthat's the new version of SCSI.\n\n453\n00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:55.660\nIt's very fast, but\nit's used mainly in servers.\n\n454\n00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.250\nOn workstations and on regular systems,\neven like the Mac Pros,\n\n455\n00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.660\nthey've almost all moved over to SATA,\nwhich is serial ATA.\n\n456\n00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.550\nATA is the Advanced Technology Attachment,\nwhich is really old, all the way up here.\n\n457\n00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:11.460\nThis is the old ATA, and\nthat's been replaced by serial ATA.\n\n458\n00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.900\nSo inside of my computer\nI've got a 500 GB SSD.\n\n459\n00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.660\nAnd there it is.\n\n460\n00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.120\nI can see it attached\nto that serial ATA bus.\n\n461\n00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.490\nTo give you an idea of the speeds\non some of this stuff,\n\n462\n00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:23.440\nATA maxed out at 133 megabits per second.\n\n463\n00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.880\nSerial ATA is six hundred\nmegabits per second.\n\n464\n00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.830\nOr megabytes per second.\n\n465\n00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.210\nI think it's even higher.\n\n466\n00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.675\nSo it's significantly faster\nthan the old ATA standard.\n\n467\n00:22:32.675 --> 00:22:36.930\nSCSI really capped out at\nabout 320 megabits per second.\n\n468\n00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.020\nSorry, I gotta get this right,\nthe bits versus bytes is really a problem.\n\n469\n00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.410\nSo in SCSI it was 320\nmegabytes per second.\n\n470\n00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:46.230\nRemember that there are 8 bits to a byte,\nso\n\n471\n00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.000\nwhen I say 320 megabytes you\nmultiply it by 8 and you got bits.\n\n472\n00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.549\nThat's why its important\nto get that straight.\n\n473\n00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.450\nSo it can go really,\nreally fast, SCSI can.\n\n474\n00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.790\nSerial attached SCSI can go even faster,\n\n475\n00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.900\nthanks to some of the advancements\nthat are out there and\n\n476\n00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:05.065\nits not uncommon to find 6 gigabit serial\nattached SCSI systems or 6 gigabyte.\n\n477\n00:23:05.065 --> 00:23:06.219\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n478\n00:23:06.219 --> 00:23:09.170\nyeah its If I screw it up here out\nloud look into our show notes and\n\n479\n00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.690\nI'll make sure that it\nis absolutely correct.\n\n480\n00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.480\nIt's the difference between\na capital B and a lower case b.\n\n481\n00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.420\nIt is really easy to mix those up but\nit is very fast.\n\n482\n00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.920\nAs far as storage is concerned serial\nattached SCSI is usually going to give you\n\n483\n00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.420\nthe fastest connection but\n\n484\n00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.750\nit's not normally available in most of our\nsystems so serial ATA is kind of next and\n\n485\n00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.040\nthat's what we'll see that\na lot of ours are using.\n\n486\n00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.050\nThere are other technologies for\nconnecting storage like FireWire.\n\n487\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.130\nFireWire is what used to be the fastest,\nand so\n\n488\n00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.870\na lot of Macs would have\na FireWire port on the back.\n\n489\n00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:39.230\nNone of ones sold today do, but many of\nthe ones that you will be supporting in\n\n490\n00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.930\nthe field that are still supported by\nApple today have those FireWire ports.\n\n491\n00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.910\nI remember when FireWire first came out,\nand\n\n492\n00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.790\nit just blew me away with how fast it was.\n\n493\n00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.010\nIn the latest version of FireWire,\n\n494\n00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:51.000\nit actually goes up to\n800 megabits per second.\n\n495\n00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.905\nThat one actually is bits.\n\n496\n00:23:51.905 --> 00:23:54.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it is 800 megabits per second\n\n497\n00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.090\nWhich is pretty darn fast for\nstorage back in the day.\n\n498\n00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.083\nBut Intel released Thunderbolt\na few years ago, and\n\n499\n00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:03.335\nit has kind of taken the world by storm.\n\n500\n00:24:03.335 --> 00:24:06.813\nAnd FireWire disappeared almost overnight,\nreplaced by Thunderbolt, and\n\n501\n00:24:06.813 --> 00:24:08.745\nnow replaced by Thunderbolt version two.\n\n502\n00:24:08.745 --> 00:24:10.541\nAnd you end up with a laptop like mine,\n\n503\n00:24:10.541 --> 00:24:14.434\nwhere I've got a couple of Thunderbolt\nports, I don't have any FireWire ports.\n\n504\n00:24:14.434 --> 00:24:16.520\nSo Thunderbolt is now\nkind of the replacement.\n\n505\n00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.030\nAnd if you look at Thunderbolt,\nwell I see my UltraStudio Mini Recorder.\n\n506\n00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:25.850\nThat video recorder needs a lot of speed\nto be able to move high quality video.\n\n507\n00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.390\nAnd if you look down here,\nlook at the speed on this thing,\n\n508\n00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.390\nup to 20 gigabits per second.\n\n509\n00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.250\nThunderbolt version one was up to 10 gigs,\n\n510\n00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:38.120\nThunderbolt version two up\nto 20 gigabits per second.\n\n511\n00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.260\nSo I get can move 20 gigabits\nof data between my laptop and\n\n512\n00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.540\nthis little recorder that's plugged in,\nand that's very, very powerful.\n\n513\n00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.240\n&gt;&gt; That gives you that high quality\nvideo that you're looking for, right?\n\n514\n00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and if you're moving\nsomething really big, like 4K.\n\n515\n00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.490\n4K video is an impressive amount of data,\nand\n\n516\n00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.250\nyou need that high bandwidth\nto be able to do it.\n\n517\n00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.720\nThere's USB 3,\nUSB 3 can move a good bit of data too.\n\n518\n00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.760\nBut when you take a look at this one,\nnotice my USB 3 connection here.\n\n519\n00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.010\nIt's saying up to 12 megabits per second.\n\n520\n00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.620\nWell that's not the same\nas 20 gigabytes per second.\n\n521\n00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.950\nWell in this case, that's not really fair,\nbecause that's my keyboard.\n\n522\n00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.910\nSo we don't need a huge\namount of traffic there.\n\n523\n00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:22.150\nIf I take a look at something like my,\nwhere's my network adaptor.\n\n524\n00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:28.544\n[CROSSTALK] No it's Thunderbolt so\nit's not [CROSSTALK] plug in.\n\n525\n00:25:28.544 --> 00:25:31.270\nYou know, actually, have I,\nhere plug in my hard drive.\n\n526\n00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.780\nSo if I plug in my USB hard drive here,\nwe'll see it come up,\n\n527\n00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.700\nand it'll have a higher speed.\n\n528\n00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.400\nAnd that's cuz there's more\nthan one version of USB, right?\n\n529\n00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.787\nUSB version one,\nversion two, version three.\n\n530\n00:25:39.787 --> 00:25:43.960\nUSB-C ports technically use USB version\n3.1, so it's not like a huge change.\n\n531\n00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.470\nUSB-C just mainly changes\nthe connector type.\n\n532\n00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.810\nSo when I plug in something\nlike that hard drive and\n\n533\n00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:53.120\ngive it a moment to turn\nup here on the USB bus.\n\n534\n00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.770\nIt'll show and\nwe don't have to wait for it,\n\n535\n00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:58.390\nthe USB 3 maximum speed is 5 gigabit,\nokay?\n\n536\n00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:02.000\nSo 5 gigabit\nVersus Thunderbolt's 20 gigabit.\n\n537\n00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.580\nI can get four times the speed by going\nwith Thunderbolt 2 over using USB 3.\n\n538\n00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.170\nUSB 3 is very fast at 5 gigabit,\nbut it's not 20 gigabit right?\n\n539\n00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:11.235\nSo there's always something faster.\n\n540\n00:26:11.235 --> 00:26:14.498\n&gt;&gt; Did you ever see the instruction manual\nfor a how to plug in a typical USB.\n\n541\n00:26:14.498 --> 00:26:16.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've seen a few.\n\n542\n00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.460\n&gt;&gt; You try it this way, and it says wrong.\n\n543\n00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.700\nYou try it the other way,\nand it says wrong.\n\n544\n00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.570\nYou turn it back over, it says correct.\n\n545\n00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:21.095\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n546\n00:26:21.095 --> 00:26:23.110\n&gt;&gt; And that's what USB-C fixes, right?\n\n547\n00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:24.755\nUSB-C doesn't really introduce any great,\n\n548\n00:26:24.755 --> 00:26:27.520\nnew, amazing speed, it's more about\nconvenience to that connector.\n\n549\n00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.415\nThat, when you take a look at USB-C\n\n550\n00:26:29.415 --> 00:26:31.205\nit can actually be plugged in either way.\n\n551\n00:26:31.205 --> 00:26:33.225\nUpside down or upside right, and it works.\n\n552\n00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:38.415\nAll the old USBs had to go in a particular\nway, so that was kind of frustrating.\n\n553\n00:26:38.415 --> 00:26:41.515\nAll right, so\nthere's a few other connector types\n\n554\n00:26:41.515 --> 00:26:43.515\nthat you might encounter out\nthere in the real world.\n\n555\n00:26:43.515 --> 00:26:45.415\nBut for the most part that's\nwhat you're gonna see.\n\n556\n00:26:45.415 --> 00:26:47.657\nAnd on the newest Macs,\nthey're going all USB-C.\n\n557\n00:26:47.657 --> 00:26:51.220\nSo USB-C is really the way to go,\nand I know what you're saying.\n\n558\n00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:55.670\nDidn't I just say that USB-C can only do 5\ngigabit and Thunderbolt can do 20 gigabit?\n\n559\n00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.380\nWhy is Apple moving away from it?\n\n560\n00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:02.230\nWell they aren't, on the newest\nMacBooks they've got all USB-C ports\n\n561\n00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:04.670\nwith Thunderbolt 2 chips on them.\n\n562\n00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.900\nAnd they're working on\nthe Thunderbolt 3 side of things.\n\n563\n00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.540\n&gt;&gt; So even though it's a USB-C connector,\nif it's a Thunderbolt device,\n\n564\n00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.870\nit'll talk to the Thunderbolt chip.\n\n565\n00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.200\nAnd it will actually do 20 gigs, so\n\n566\n00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.875\nyou can still do that higher connection\neven though it's now a USB-C connector.\n\n567\n00:27:19.875 --> 00:27:21.895\nApple's just moved away from\nthe proprietary connector,\n\n568\n00:27:21.895 --> 00:27:23.731\nwhich is kind of a nice thing to-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n569\n00:27:23.731 --> 00:27:25.135\nthat was definitely\na smart move on their end.\n\n570\n00:27:25.135 --> 00:27:27.875\nBecause who wants to be, well,\nthat's the wrong kind, I gotta try and\n\n571\n00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:28.785\nfind another cable.\n\n572\n00:27:28.785 --> 00:27:30.972\nThat can become very, very frustrating.\n\n573\n00:27:30.972 --> 00:27:35.635\nAnd the USB-C, well at least the connector\ntype, that's gonna change the game.\n\n574\n00:27:35.635 --> 00:27:37.188\nAll you need is that one type of cable.\n\n575\n00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:40.650\nAnd no matter whether it's a Thunderbolt\nor USB, you should be good to go.\n\n576\n00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.900\nDon, we've gone through\na lot of the peripherals.\n\n577\n00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.100\nHow we connect them,\nspeeds that they can do.\n\n578\n00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.520\nWhy we might be connecting things.\n\n579\n00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.740\nIs there any thing else you want to throw\non the pile before we call it a day?\n\n580\n00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.350\n&gt;&gt; The only thing that\nI've really left off here.\n\n581\n00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:54.610\nWe didn't talk about printers,\n\n582\n00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.520\nwe are going to cover those\nin a separate episode.\n\n583\n00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.920\nWe've got a lot to talk about on printers.\n\n584\n00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:03.070\nAnd then there's a ton of peripherals\nwe have that are wireless, right?\n\n585\n00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:07.070\nThat when you connect to a Wi-Fi network,\nyou might see your Samsung TV or\n\n586\n00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:10.140\nyour Apple TV and\nbe able to talk to those too.\n\n587\n00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.550\nThose are peripherals that\nwe don't even plug into.\n\n588\n00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.710\nThey're really separate hosts, but we\ntalk to them, we share that information.\n\n589\n00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:16.984\nWe use them as if they were peripherals.\n\n590\n00:28:16.984 --> 00:28:18.500\nBut be aware of that,\n\n591\n00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.700\ntoo, not everything has to be\ndirectly plugged into your device.\n\n592\n00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.170\nPlenty of it works wirelessly.\n\n593\n00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.690\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff, Don, thank you so\nmuch for joining us today.\n\n594\n00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:29.190\nAnd explaining peripherals for\nour good Mac users out there.\n\n595\n00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.630\nHope you guys enjoyed this,\ngot a lot out of the episode.\n\n596\n00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:35.360\nAnd now you should be able to be\nat least somewhat intelligibly\n\n597\n00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.790\nable to speak about all the peripheral\ndevices you can connect to your Mac.\n\n598\n00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.990\nThat being said, looking at our clock, and\nwe are well out of time for this episode.\n\n599\n00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:44.780\nWe do thank you for joining us,\nbut signing off for ITProTV.\n\n600\n00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.410\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n601\n00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:47.330\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n602\n00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:48.896\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n603\n00:28:48.896 --> 00:28:54.816\n[MUSIC]\n\n604\n00:28:54.816 --> 00:28:58.123\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:14.219\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.490\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.750\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode, well, I hope you're ready for\n\n7\n00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.830\nsome more ACSP, because that's what\nwe've got on the burner for you.\n\n8\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.250\nAnd joining us in the studio, the head\nchef himself, our good friend, Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.950\nDon Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.590\nDon, good to have you again today.\n\n11\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.140\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.030\n&gt;&gt; Hey, glad to be back.\n\n13\n00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.468\nReady to dive into our\nnext chapter of ACSP.\n\n14\n00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:37.540\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at printers.\n\n15\n00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.530\nAnd let me tell you, just before you\nhit the fast forward or skip button.\n\n16\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.984\n&gt;&gt; Make sure that you sit down cuz\nthis is an exciting episode, right?\n\n17\n00:00:42.984 --> 00:00:43.591\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n18\n00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:45.721\na lot of us have moved away from printers,\nright.\n\n19\n00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:47.120\nWe just don't use them anymore.\n\n20\n00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.690\nYou generate PDFs or\ndigital documents, and that's it.\n\n21\n00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.060\nBut in the business world, printers are\npretty ubiquitous, I mean, they're very,\n\n22\n00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.490\nvery common place, at a minimum,\nfor printing receipts.\n\n23\n00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.690\nAnd so, supporting and\n\n24\n00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.600\nworking with printers on a regular\nbasis is something that you will do.\n\n25\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.030\nI mean it's something that's\nnot going away anytime soon.\n\n26\n00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.945\nSo don't hit the skip button.\n\n27\n00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:09.507\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Know that when you get out there in\n\n28\n00:01:09.507 --> 00:01:13.439\nthe real world that you're gonna be\nexpected to connect printers to devices,\n\n29\n00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.150\nand the support for them actually is\nreally, really well built in Mac OS.\n\n30\n00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.470\nSo it's gonna be a pleasure,\nsome of the things we go through but\n\n31\n00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.170\nwe wanna tackle what it takes to get\nthe printers attached, how to use them,\n\n32\n00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.360\nhow to troubleshoot, and\n\n33\n00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.830\nsome of the other resources that\nare available as far as managing printers.\n\n34\n00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.610\nAnd that's all stuff we're gonna take\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n35\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.940\n&gt;&gt; You know what Don we actually could\nprobably label this under some sort\n\n36\n00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.170\nof OSHA Safety Guideline.\n\n37\n00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.590\nBecause let me tell you what,\n\n38\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.840\nwhen a printer doesn't work\npeople get hostile real quick.\n\n39\n00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.170\nSo you learning the skills on how to to\nkeep these printers connected and up and\n\n40\n00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.060\nrunning is gonna really serve\nyou well in the business sense.\n\n41\n00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.050\nSo Don, that being said, let's start\nthere, how do we get a printer connected?\n\n42\n00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.250\n&gt;&gt; All right, so there are two ways that\nwe can get a printer set up in Mac OS.\n\n43\n00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.660\nThere's the automatic way and\nthe manual way.\n\n44\n00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.740\nAnd most of us are gonna go automatic\nlike the name implies, it's really easy.\n\n45\n00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.352\nLike you hook a printer up and\nit just magically works.\n\n46\n00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:03.200\nRight, that sort of the Mac\nmentality of it just works thing.\n\n47\n00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.370\nWell, if you have a printer\nthat connects via USB or\n\n48\n00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.850\nsome kind of physical connector, typically\nyou'll plug it in, Mac OS will see it and\n\n49\n00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.880\nit will just automatically work based on\nbuilt-in drivers that are part of Mac OS.\n\n50\n00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.400\nDoesn't even have to go\nout to the Internet and\n\n51\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.460\nget anything, it does just work.\n\n52\n00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.020\nThe challenge that we bump into though,\n\n53\n00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.460\nis that most printers don't\nplug right in anymore, right?\n\n54\n00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.630\nMost printers are shared printers,\nthey have a network jack on them or\n\n55\n00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.460\nthey connect to the Wi-Fi network.\n\n56\n00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.810\nAnd so, you're not plugging in a cable.\n\n57\n00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.650\nAnd if that's the case, your Mac is\nnot going to automatically set it up.\n\n58\n00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.680\nWe need to get it put in place.\n\n59\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.930\nIn this building, there are at least four\nprinters that I should be able to see\n\n60\n00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.040\nright now that are all on the network.\n\n61\n00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.910\nBut my Mac isn't set to use any of them.\n\n62\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.009\nIf I take my Mac here,\nI'll go into my system preferences.\n\n63\n00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.420\nAnd in my system preferences,\nI'm gonna go into Printers and Scanners.\n\n64\n00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.830\nScanners are another thing that\nwe don't really use anymore.\n\n65\n00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.070\nBut if I go to Printers and Scanners\nas you can see I've got nothing and\n\n66\n00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.535\nI just said that there's at least like\nfour printers here in the building,\n\n67\n00:03:03.535 --> 00:03:06.185\nI should be seeing one of them, right?\n\n68\n00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.455\nWell, it's not automatic.\n\n69\n00:03:07.455 --> 00:03:09.285\nWe don't automatically\nadd network printers,\n\n70\n00:03:09.285 --> 00:03:10.655\ncuz we don't know if they're trusted or\nnot.\n\n71\n00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:12.615\nWe don't know where they are,\nyou don't wanna print to a printer you\n\n72\n00:03:12.615 --> 00:03:14.315\ndon't even know where\nit physically resides.\n\n73\n00:03:14.315 --> 00:03:15.655\nYou'll lose your data.\n\n74\n00:03:15.655 --> 00:03:17.225\nSo, it doesn't add those.\n\n75\n00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:21.488\nIf I physically plug a printer in though,\nit will automatically add that and\n\n76\n00:03:21.488 --> 00:03:23.632\ntypically it'll just work, right.\n\n77\n00:03:23.632 --> 00:03:26.810\nBut if we wanna add one that's\non the network, we can do that,\n\n78\n00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.682\nif will use plus sign here,\nyou can choose to add it, and\n\n79\n00:03:29.682 --> 00:03:34.174\nnow it's finding some nearby printers, now\nI said four, it looks like three I guess.\n\n80\n00:03:34.174 --> 00:03:36.873\nBut can see a couple of different printers\nthat are sitting out there, whenever.\n\n81\n00:03:36.873 --> 00:03:42.240\nTwo of the same model,\nthere's two HP LaserJet M553s out there,\n\n82\n00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.118\nbut one is 40B176, the other is BFF017-\n&gt;&gt; Is that their Mac address?\n\n83\n00:03:48.118 --> 00:03:50.587\n&gt;&gt; These are actually just little\nidentifiers that are attached,\n\n84\n00:03:50.587 --> 00:03:51.840\nkinda like a Mac address.\n\n85\n00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.803\nBut this one,\nbest friends forever, I think.\n\n86\n00:03:54.803 --> 00:03:56.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe that's the printer I wanna use.\n\n87\n00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.786\nBut even when you have multiple ones of\nthe same model you do see a little bit\n\n88\n00:03:59.786 --> 00:04:03.140\nextra information to help you\ndifferentiate which one which is which.\n\n89\n00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.682\nAnd you know Daniel that might actually\nbe the second half of the Mac address,\n\n90\n00:04:06.682 --> 00:04:08.242\nI'm not sure but just general-\n&gt;&gt; Just\n\n91\n00:04:08.242 --> 00:04:08.882\nsomething-\n&gt;&gt; Identifiers\n\n92\n00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:09.382\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n93\n00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.410\n&gt;&gt; To differentiate them.\n\n94\n00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.089\nAnd then there is an M506, that's actually\nthe printer that I normally print to on\n\n95\n00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.070\na regular basis when I print my show\nnotes so I know what to talk about.\n\n96\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.480\nThat is the printer that I print to.\n\n97\n00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.360\nSo it is seeing these on the network.\n\n98\n00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.250\nAnd if l wanna connect the one it can be\nas easiest just choosing it, right and\n\n99\n00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.790\nthere it is and that's it.\n\n100\n00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.464\nAll right.\n\n101\n00:04:27.464 --> 00:04:29.830\nDid it ask me for a driver?\n\n102\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.427\nNo.\nDid they make me download anything that\n\n103\n00:04:32.427 --> 00:04:34.408\neven reach out to the Internet?\n\n104\n00:04:34.408 --> 00:04:37.274\nNo, it saw that this was\nan HP LaserJet M506 and\n\n105\n00:04:37.274 --> 00:04:41.434\nit said, I've already got a driver for\nthat, it's an HP printer,\n\n106\n00:04:41.434 --> 00:04:44.530\nwill print to it, and\nthere we go, all right?\n\n107\n00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.260\nNow, that's pretty automatic.\n\n108\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.430\nIt's hard to make it\nmore automatic than that.\n\n109\n00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.500\nAnd now I've got a printer\nthat's ready for me to use and\n\n110\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.700\nwhatever software I want,\nand I want to print it.\n\n111\n00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.060\nBut when you go automatic like this,\nit's using the built-in driver.\n\n112\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.650\nAnd the built-in driver doesn't\nalways have the full support for\n\n113\n00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.830\nwhat's available inside of a printer.\n\n114\n00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.900\nSo let's talk a little bit about\nhow we talk to the printer, right.\n\n115\n00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.401\nMac OS is a very amazing\ngraphical user interface, right.\n\n116\n00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:13.480\nIt makes it easy to\ninteract with the computer.\n\n117\n00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.608\nBut under the hood, it's running\nBSD units, which is an extremely\n\n118\n00:05:17.608 --> 00:05:23.273\nun-user-friendly operating system, but is\nvery powerful, robust and stable, right.\n\n119\n00:05:23.273 --> 00:05:25.830\nBut that's all hidden from us by the GUI.\n\n120\n00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.400\nWell one of the problems with\nthe Unix Operating Systems and\n\n121\n00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.260\nLinux was that for years,\nsupporting printers was a nightmare.\n\n122\n00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.640\nThere was one little demon that run\non the background called the LPD,\n\n123\n00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.690\nLine Printer Demon, and the line\nprinter demon had this very simple\n\n124\n00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.170\nway of communicating the printers it\nwas designed for dot matrix printers.\n\n125\n00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.632\nThe ones that rattle off line by line and\nhad the tractor fed paper and\n\n126\n00:05:46.632 --> 00:05:48.293\nI'm filling up the terms here.\n\n127\n00:05:48.293 --> 00:05:49.158\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful noise.\n\n128\n00:05:49.158 --> 00:05:51.853\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And if you're under 30 year old and\n\n129\n00:05:51.853 --> 00:05:54.931\nwatching this you have no idea what\nI'm talking about cuz this is ancient\n\n130\n00:05:54.931 --> 00:05:58.940\ntechnology, that's what LPD was designed\nto use and it's still supported today.\n\n131\n00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.590\nWell, Apple looked to that and\n\n132\n00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.980\nsaid, boy that doesn't carry over to\nlaser printers and so every laser\n\n133\n00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.290\nprinter that comes out has to have it's\nown custom driver and it's a nightmare.\n\n134\n00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.580\nSo Apple worked with an open\nsource project called CUPS, and\n\n135\n00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.970\nCUPS is the Common Unix Printing System.\n\n136\n00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.470\nAnd what it did is it strove to create\na system that was common across all of\n\n137\n00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.890\nthe different Unix distributions that\nare out there, which included BSD Unix, or\n\n138\n00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.380\nDarwin, inside of Mac OS, but also all the\nLinux distributions that are out there,\n\n139\n00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.650\nlike Red Hat, Debian,\nUbuntu, and those guys.\n\n140\n00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.320\nAnd they made it where, for software,\n\n141\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.900\nit just had to know how to talk to CUPS,\nand CUPS look the same everywhere.\n\n142\n00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.080\nAnd then for the manufacturers\nthat are making these printers,\n\n143\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.140\nthey just had to make it CUPS-compatible.\n\n144\n00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.280\nAnd it would work for MacOS and\nLinux, and all these other platforms.\n\n145\n00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.530\nSo it helped to move us away from having\nto create all these crazy different\n\n146\n00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.450\ndrivers for\ndifferent applications and things,\n\n147\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.200\nthat it created this common environment,\nthat was very flexible.\n\n148\n00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.930\nApple dumped a ton of money into it,\nand then turned it over to the open\n\n149\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.340\nsource world, and so it was freely\ngiven back into that environment.\n\n150\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.520\nAnd now we have a great printer subsystem\nthat can do things like what we just saw\n\n151\n00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.280\nwhere it was automatic.\n\n152\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.770\nWell, the way it works is in the\nbackground it expects a driver to exist,\n\n153\n00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.360\nand Apple pre-packages\na number of drivers.\n\n154\n00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.480\nBut the drivers are typically basic,\nright?\n\n155\n00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.990\nAnd the drivers, they manifest themselves\nif you ever wanna see it here,\n\n156\n00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.130\nlet me go into my terminal.\n\n157\n00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:28.370\nAnd if you drop in your terminal and\nyou go into /Library/Printers,\n\n158\n00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.220\nokay, that's where your printers reside.\n\n159\n00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.060\nAnd what you're gonna see\nare a few different folders.\n\n160\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.580\nI see like Canon and Epson.\n\n161\n00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.940\nI don't have any Epson printers.\n\n162\n00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:37.950\nI don't have any Canon printers.\n\n163\n00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.140\nThis is some of the pre-installed\nthings that come with MacOS.\n\n164\n00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.110\nBut the folder I wanna\nhighlight was that PPDs folder.\n\n165\n00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.050\nPPD, okay.\n\n166\n00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.580\nPPDs are the printer drivers, all right.\n\n167\n00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.113\nAnd if I keep browsing inside of here,\n\n168\n00:07:51.113 --> 00:07:55.238\neventually I'll find where\nthere's some PPD files, okay.\n\n169\n00:07:55.238 --> 00:07:57.830\nAnd here I can see two Epson Fax files,\n\n170\n00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:03.270\nthey're gzips which are compressed Files,\nbut there's PPDs inside of them.\n\n171\n00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.390\nNow these are ones that have been\ninstalled on my system somehow.\n\n172\n00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.710\nSome software I installed must have\nbrought them along and I'm in /Library.\n\n173\n00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.675\nThere's also ones that are inside\nof /System/Library/Printers, and\n\n174\n00:08:14.675 --> 00:08:16.995\nthose are ones that are included.\n\n175\n00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:20.285\nSo the HP PPDs must be there, or\nthey might be using the Epson one and\n\n176\n00:08:20.285 --> 00:08:22.545\nsharing that, although I seriously\ndoubt that, but they may.\n\n177\n00:08:22.545 --> 00:08:25.565\nSo we may have to browse a few\ndifferent places to find it, so\n\n178\n00:08:25.565 --> 00:08:29.105\nif I jump into /System/Library/Printers/.\n\n179\n00:08:29.105 --> 00:08:34.835\nAnd I come in here, I can see that\nwe've got a libraries folder.\n\n180\n00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:40.450\nAnd in here we've got\nUSBGenericPrintingClass.plugin.\n\n181\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.290\nIPP, which is internet printing protocol.\n\n182\n00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.440\nWe've got a few other\nlittle items in here.\n\n183\n00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.220\nEach of these are generic plugins,\nand I don't see HP in the list.\n\n184\n00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.990\nAnd so what that tells me is,\nthat while yes,\n\n185\n00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.410\nI can print to this HP printer that\nI've added here in the background.\n\n186\n00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.809\nI'm not gonna be able to take\nadvantage of advanced functionality.\n\n187\n00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:00.894\nWell fortunately for me,\n\n188\n00:09:00.894 --> 00:09:03.550\nthis printer doesn't really\nhave advanced functionality.\n\n189\n00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.764\nIt doesn't have a stapler,\na hole puncher and all that.\n\n190\n00:09:06.764 --> 00:09:10.280\nIt just has a couple of paper trays,\nand that's it.\n\n191\n00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.726\nAnd in fact, if I look in the picture,\nit only shows one paper tray.\n\n192\n00:09:12.726 --> 00:09:14.330\nOurs has a second paper tray.\n\n193\n00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.650\nSo I might not even be detecting\nall of the functions are there.\n\n194\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.570\nIf I go into Options &amp; Supplies and\n\n195\n00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:25.870\nI take a look here, it's not really\ngiving me many options at all right?\n\n196\n00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.260\nSo that's the thing about\nautomatic printing.\n\n197\n00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.990\nAnd as a result in order to get\nthe full functionality out of a printer\n\n198\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.010\neven when it's automatically set\nup we might need to come back in.\n\n199\n00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.960\nAnd install a driver and load the driver\nto unlock the full functionality of this\n\n200\n00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.310\nprinter and\nbe able to take advantage of it.\n\n201\n00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.111\n&gt;&gt; This come back to the drivers,\ndoesn't it, Don?\n\n202\n00:09:42.111 --> 00:09:44.570\n&gt;&gt; It really does yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] They're always a problem,\n\n203\n00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.450\nwell I say a problem.\n\n204\n00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.540\nA lot of people when you're supporting\nprinters it comes down to we need to load\n\n205\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.720\nthe correct driver, that's why you're not\nseeing the functionality that you need.\n\n206\n00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.240\nBecause either your\ndrivers become corrupt,\n\n207\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.790\nwe need to reinstall it or you just never\nloaded the correct one to begin with.\n\n208\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.427\n&gt;&gt; Right, and with normal hardware like\na video capture device if you don't\n\n209\n00:10:01.427 --> 00:10:04.314\nhave the driver installed it\nusually just doesn't work.\n\n210\n00:10:04.314 --> 00:10:06.588\nYou don't see it, right, but\nprinters aren't like that,\n\n211\n00:10:06.588 --> 00:10:08.580\nprinters will use these automatic drivers.\n\n212\n00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.609\nAnd so it'll show up and\nI can use it, it's missing features.\n\n213\n00:10:12.609 --> 00:10:15.065\nAnd so it's hard for\nusers to notice there's a problem.\n\n214\n00:10:15.065 --> 00:10:17.390\nAnd then they call and they're like,\nmy printer's not working right.\n\n215\n00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.215\nAnd it's the driver's not loaded,\nthey are able to communicate with it but\n\n216\n00:10:20.215 --> 00:10:21.530\nthey're missing things.\n\n217\n00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.503\nSo getting the right driver is important\nwhen working with the printer.\n\n218\n00:10:24.503 --> 00:10:25.831\nSo let me just show you an example for\nthis one.\n\n219\n00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:29.084\nThis is an M506, I'm gonna go ahead and\njust remove it out of the list.\n\n220\n00:10:29.084 --> 00:10:31.990\nSo let me knock that one back out,\nI'll delete that.\n\n221\n00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:36.480\nOkay and then I'm gonna go\ndown here to good old Safari.\n\n222\n00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.930\nAnd, oop that's not Safari,\nwhere is Safari?\n\n223\n00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:43.720\nHere, if you go to HP's website\nyou can go to support.hp.com.\n\n224\n00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.756\nAnd I'm using an HP printer,\ncuz that's what I have.\n\n225\n00:10:45.756 --> 00:10:50.760\nIt would be the same for Epson, Canon,\nBrother, who are the other, Lexmark.\n\n226\n00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.524\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Lexmark.\n&gt;&gt; I think Lexmark and\n\n227\n00:10:51.524 --> 00:10:52.770\nBrother are the same thing now,\naren't they?\n\n228\n00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:53.900\n&gt;&gt; Dell, Lexmark and Dell.\n\n229\n00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.256\n&gt;&gt; Dell, okay, so\nseveral printer manufacturers out there.\n\n230\n00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:58.943\nThey're all the same, it doesn't really\nmatter which one you get these days.\n\n231\n00:10:58.943 --> 00:11:02.990\n[LAUGH] But I don't have a loyalty to\nany particular printer manufacturer.\n\n232\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.820\nBut you go to the website and they'll\nhave where you can download drivers.\n\n233\n00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.386\nNow HP does it a slightly different way.\n\n234\n00:11:08.386 --> 00:11:12.000\nSome of them have like a Lexmark,\nif you go to Lexmark.\n\n235\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.003\nAnd you go to download a driver from them.\n\n236\n00:11:14.003 --> 00:11:18.442\nThey actually have where you can download\nthe straight up PPDs to take and\n\n237\n00:11:18.442 --> 00:11:22.210\nput in that library folder\nto add that printer driver.\n\n238\n00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.964\nAnd so when you go that way\nwell that's a much more involve\n\n239\n00:11:26.964 --> 00:11:31.232\nprocess right downloading the PPD and\nloading it.\n\n240\n00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:35.077\nHP they have what's called their easy\nstart and you run it and it'll just go and\n\n241\n00:11:35.077 --> 00:11:38.540\nand pull down the files that you need\nbased on the hardware it detects.\n\n242\n00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.170\nSo it tries to make\na little more automatic.\n\n243\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.770\nBut here I'm on Lexmark web page and\n\n244\n00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.410\nyou'll see some of the different\nprinters and stuff.\n\n245\n00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.626\nI'm gonna go with just a monochrome laser,\nI'm not gonna go too crazy.\n\n246\n00:11:47.626 --> 00:11:52.922\nSo let's say I've got one of these Lexmark\nE260, I'm just picking at random here.\n\n247\n00:11:52.922 --> 00:11:57.620\nThis could be an ancient printer, so I'll\napologize ahead of time if I'm doing that.\n\n248\n00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.420\nBut printer drivers hadn't\nreally changed all that much.\n\n249\n00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.230\nBut when I go here to pull it up,\nit's trying to figure out\n\n250\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.810\nwhat operating system I'm running and\nshow me the drivers that are available.\n\n251\n00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.055\nAnd if I look at the operating system,\nI can see Macintosh is in the list, and\n\n252\n00:12:10.055 --> 00:12:12.764\nif I pick a version,\nthey're going all the way up to 10.9.\n\n253\n00:12:12.764 --> 00:12:16.384\nNow you might be worried,\nlike 10.9, that's Mavericks,\n\n254\n00:12:16.384 --> 00:12:19.411\nthen you had Elk, no,\nthat's Yosemite, right?\n\n255\n00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:24.210\nAnd then we had El Capitan, and now\nwe've got Sierras, two versions behind.\n\n256\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.601\nYou'll find that oftentimes they work.\n\n257\n00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:29.870\nSee how this says Print Driver for 10.6.8\nand later, whichever version I picked\n\n258\n00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.090\nhere, as long as it was 10.6.8 that\nI would have gotten this driver.\n\n259\n00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.946\nBut I can come here and\npull up the Print Driver for Mac OS and\n\n260\n00:12:37.946 --> 00:12:40.883\nwonder why they have\nit listed three times.\n\n261\n00:12:40.883 --> 00:12:41.587\n&gt;&gt; Very interesting.\n\n262\n00:12:41.587 --> 00:12:44.663\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they're all the same,\nthey are updated on the same day so\n\n263\n00:12:44.663 --> 00:12:47.757\nI'd have to look at the url and\nsee if they're any different.\n\n264\n00:12:47.757 --> 00:12:50.428\nMy little float over is not giving me,\nwhatever we'll click on one.\n\n265\n00:12:50.428 --> 00:12:52.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure it's safe.\n\n266\n00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.550\nSo when you click on it, see how it's\na dmg file, that I'm downloading?\n\n267\n00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.694\nAnd it shows as being really small,\n2.8 megs, right?\n\n268\n00:12:59.694 --> 00:13:03.362\nMost printer drives are small,\nunless if I had picked a multi function\n\n269\n00:13:03.362 --> 00:13:06.360\nprinter cuz then it would need\nsoftware for the scanner.\n\n270\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.090\nIt would need software for the fax, and\n\n271\n00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.330\nall of a sudden it's 200 megs in size,\nright?\n\n272\n00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.520\nBut when it is a simple function printer,\nit'll be a pretty small file.\n\n273\n00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.290\nAnd looking down here it says,\ninstalls a print driver,\n\n274\n00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:20.720\nincluding PostScript print Description,\nor PPD.\n\n275\n00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.960\nThere's that PPD that I was talking about.\n\n276\n00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.170\nThis one also has\na Print Dialog Extension or PDE.\n\n277\n00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.613\nThat is, when I go to print,\n\n278\n00:13:27.613 --> 00:13:30.991\nit'll display additional options\nin my configuration, right.\n\n279\n00:13:30.991 --> 00:13:34.569\nSo if I fire up Textedit, and\nI go to print something, right.\n\n280\n00:13:34.569 --> 00:13:39.880\nSo if I just create a new document and\ngo this is a document, all right.\n\n281\n00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.270\nAnd if I go to print by going up here\nto my menu and choosing File and\n\n282\n00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.840\nPrint, then I'll see print options\nhere that I can customize.\n\n283\n00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.794\nAnd if the driver comes with a PDE you'll\nsee more options here than normal.\n\n284\n00:13:51.794 --> 00:13:54.800\nYou might have scaling where you\ncan fit the page or whatever.\n\n285\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.540\nIt has to understand how to\ncommunicate that to the printer.\n\n286\n00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.357\nIt doesn't do that by default because\nthat functionality isn't known.\n\n287\n00:14:00.357 --> 00:14:03.540\nWe don't know how to communicate\nthat to the printer, so.\n\n288\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.290\nSo that's what's going on there.\n\n289\n00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.890\nSo if I download this file,\nI'll go ahead and\n\n290\n00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.660\nhit the Download link, it's gonna\ndownload and we can get it installed.\n\n291\n00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.670\nSo this is a bit of a more manual process,\nbut\n\n292\n00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.260\nit'll usually have a quick and\neasy install, like a pkg file that we run.\n\n293\n00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.092\nAnd sure enough, it does,\nthere's that E260_Print.pkg.\n\n294\n00:14:24.092 --> 00:14:27.996\nAnd if I double click on that, it'll\nwalk me through the simple installer,\n\n295\n00:14:27.996 --> 00:14:30.323\njust like any driver\nthat we might deal with.\n\n296\n00:14:30.323 --> 00:14:35.320\nYou accept the license agreement and\nit's going to go in and install all right.\n\n297\n00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.318\nNow this one gives me the option to\nchange the installation location.\n\n298\n00:14:39.318 --> 00:14:40.970\nYou'll see a lot of drivers\ngive you that option.\n\n299\n00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.313\nIt doesn't actually let\nyou change the location.\n\n300\n00:14:43.313 --> 00:14:47.779\nIt needs to go into\nthe the libraries folder.\n\n301\n00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:49.330\nSo you typically don't\nwanna mess with that.\n\n302\n00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.840\nBut once it's done I should now have\n\n303\n00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.900\nthe Lexmark E260 drivers loaded and\nbe able to support that printer right?\n\n304\n00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.240\nNow I don't actually have that printer but\nwe'll see in a minute.\n\n305\n00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.903\nIf I had done it the HP way, HP would have\nhad me download HP Easy Start, right?\n\n306\n00:15:06.903 --> 00:15:09.409\nThat's what their webpage is\ntelling me to do back here.\n\n307\n00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:11.393\nSo it sees that I'm running Mac OS and\n\n308\n00:15:11.393 --> 00:15:14.900\nit's telling me I need to\ndownload the HP Easy Start app.\n\n309\n00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.230\nAnd so if I download that and\n\n310\n00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.160\nrun it, then what you get is\nthis little screen right here.\n\n311\n00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.490\nAnd what it does is it helps to\nautomatically detect your printer.\n\n312\n00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.551\nAnd load the right stuff so\nit's telling me here am I allowing it here\n\n313\n00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:31.329\nto collect data for product improvements,\nI guess I don't really want to do that.\n\n314\n00:15:31.329 --> 00:15:36.250\nI have to accept their end user license\nagreement, and then it scans the network.\n\n315\n00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.714\nAnd it says, which printer\nare you trying to connect to and\n\n316\n00:15:39.714 --> 00:15:42.201\nI can find the M506 somewhere in here.\n\n317\n00:15:42.201 --> 00:15:43.710\nRemember how I said there\nwere four printers?\n\n318\n00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.986\nIt looks like there were even more, or\nit's finding some more than one way,\n\n319\n00:15:46.986 --> 00:15:49.355\nlike that one's shared from Tim's laptop,\nI guess.\n\n320\n00:15:49.355 --> 00:15:53.338\nBut there's the M506 that I want so\nI'll choose it, and\n\n321\n00:15:53.338 --> 00:15:58.690\nnow it's gonna download from HP's site\nthe proper PPD and other information.\n\n322\n00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.129\nIt's gonna pull that down to make sure\nI get the full functionality of this\n\n323\n00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:02.636\nprinter.\n\n324\n00:16:02.636 --> 00:16:07.012\nIt's offering if I want to enable web\nservices, which I'll turn on now,\n\n325\n00:16:07.012 --> 00:16:08.510\nI normally don't.\n\n326\n00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.858\nAnd if I wanna register the printer\nonline, I'll pass on that, and\n\n327\n00:16:11.858 --> 00:16:13.878\nI'll accept their license agreement.\n\n328\n00:16:13.878 --> 00:16:16.440\nActually, you know what,\nI'm gonna turn off the web services.\n\n329\n00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.012\nI'm sure our firewall\nwill block that anyway.\n\n330\n00:16:18.012 --> 00:16:20.260\nSo [LAUGH] we'll go ahead and\nmove forward.\n\n331\n00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.140\nAnd now it's gonna install.\n\n332\n00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.490\nAnd here it's installing.\n\n333\n00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.230\nIt's showing that the software's\nnot installed now.\n\n334\n00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.710\nAnd it's gonna install\nthe genuine HP Drivers,\n\n335\n00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.620\nnot the generic drivers\nthat are part of MacOS, but\n\n336\n00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.520\nthe official ones from HP that may\nhave additional functionality.\n\n337\n00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.950\nAnd so we'll install that.\n\n338\n00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:38.070\nYou do have to be the administrator to\nwrite to those folders where the PPDs get\n\n339\n00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.020\nstores and\nthen that's gonna download and install.\n\n340\n00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.790\nNow notice this one's much much larger,\nright?\n\n341\n00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.920\nThat Lexmark one was\nunder three megs in size.\n\n342\n00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.586\nIt was just the PPD and PDE.\n\n343\n00:16:48.586 --> 00:16:51.640\nHere I'm already crossing 100 megabytes,\nall right?\n\n344\n00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.460\nWhy?\n\n345\n00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.480\nWell, it's got software for\nshowing me the ink levels or\n\n346\n00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.910\nthe toner levels in the printer,\nif you got a scanner or\n\n347\n00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:02.420\nmultiple trays you've got all sorts\nof different options that it loads.\n\n348\n00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.690\nAnd that can increase the size.\n\n349\n00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.480\nThis one's likely way bloated,\n\n350\n00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.960\nit probably includes drivers for other\nprinters that have more functionality.\n\n351\n00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.847\nSo wow, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times those essential software\n\n352\n00:17:11.847 --> 00:17:15.988\nthings are like printing suites of\nwould you like to do this to kinda\n\n353\n00:17:15.988 --> 00:17:20.683\ngive you a graphical interface instead of\njust giving you a print option inside of\n\n354\n00:17:20.683 --> 00:17:21.780\nyour system.\n\n355\n00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it can make them bigger.\n\n356\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.612\nAnd you could make the argument that hey,\nif I could have used the generic driver\n\n357\n00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:30.875\nand it did everything I needed,\nthen why install this extra bloat that's\n\n358\n00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:34.340\ngonna take a little more effort or\ncreate more distraction.\n\n359\n00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.210\nYou may not want this.\n\n360\n00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.230\nYou want to use just the built-in MacOS\none and that's fine unless there's\n\n361\n00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.610\nspecial functionality that you\nneed to take advantage of.\n\n362\n00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:46.740\nSo, all right, so, while that's installing\nlet's go back to my hard drive here.\n\n363\n00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.480\nAnd I'm in the system folder right now.\n\n364\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.570\nAnd things really shouldn't have changed\nhere in the system folder, right?\n\n365\n00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.620\nBecause the system folder,\nthese are the ones that came with MacOS.\n\n366\n00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.240\nSo if I take a look in here, I really\ndon't see anything different, okay?\n\n367\n00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:06.194\nBut if I go back into my main library\nfolder and into printers, all right?\n\n368\n00:18:06.194 --> 00:18:09.630\nHere's where I should start\nto see things change.\n\n369\n00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.750\nAnd you can see I do have\na Lexmark folder now.\n\n370\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.700\nI didn't have a Lexmark folder before.\n\n371\n00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.190\nIf I go into that Lexmark folder and\n\n372\n00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:21.330\ntake a look, I can see that there\nare printer icons and a filter, right?\n\n373\n00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.630\nSo it's adding content in here.\n\n374\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.220\nIt may still be using a generic PPD, and\n\n375\n00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.250\nthen this is the add on that gets it\ncustomized to whatever it needs, right?\n\n376\n00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.810\nNow the Printer Icons is so\n\n377\n00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:36.210\nthat the printer looks like its actual\ndevice in the printer preferences screen.\n\n378\n00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:40.310\nThe filter is to help control the commands\nthat are being sent to the printer.\n\n379\n00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.940\nAnd if you look,\nyou'll see PDF booklet order, LPD.\n\n380\n00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.100\nIf I use the Line Printer Daemon, LPD,\n\n381\n00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.990\nto print a PDF the order, the way that\nit collates the pages can be wrong and\n\n382\n00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.020\nso it's got a filter to correct\nthat before it goes on.\n\n383\n00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.340\nAnd so you'll see other things like that,\n\n384\n00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.710\nthese command filters that\nare being sent along.\n\n385\n00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.520\nSo that's all right\nthere inside of Lexmark.\n\n386\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.360\nAnd then if I go into the PPDs folder and\n\n387\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.760\ntake a look in there,\nlet's see if we got anything new in here.\n\n388\n00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.740\nNavigate all the way down and\nI see this has gotten quite a bit bigger.\n\n389\n00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:16.780\nThere's the Lexmark E260 and again,\nit's a G zipped file, right?\n\n390\n00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:25.550\nBut it's compressed but\nit's got the PPD and PDE that are in it.\n\n391\n00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.030\nAnd then you'll see all the HP ones.\n\n392\n00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.144\nRemember the HP one, I had a laser.m506.\n\n393\n00:19:30.144 --> 00:19:31.500\nLook at what it's doing.\n\n394\n00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.240\nIt's installing drivers for\nall these different HP printers.\n\n395\n00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.570\nNow I can see why it was 200 megs in size,\n\n396\n00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.530\ncuz all this extra junk\nthat it's putting in here.\n\n397\n00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.637\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it was the virus.\n\n398\n00:19:40.637 --> 00:19:42.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'm not worried about it.\n\n399\n00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:46.526\nBecause the drivers only go active\nif that printer is present.\n\n400\n00:19:46.526 --> 00:19:49.400\nSo mostly these are just consuming\ndisk space, not like RAM and\n\n401\n00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.980\nCPU unless I hook up to\none of those printers.\n\n402\n00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.550\nAnd that list is probably\ngonna keep growing.\n\n403\n00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.330\nNow I don't see an m506 in this list but\nthat-\n\n404\n00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.410\n&gt;&gt; It's probably sharing a driver though.\n\n405\n00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.036\n&gt;&gt; More than likely.\n\n406\n00:20:00.036 --> 00:20:00.825\n&gt;&gt; They do that a lot.\n\n407\n00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:02.372\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nSo one thing that you can do\n\n408\n00:20:02.372 --> 00:20:07.440\nif you wanna see inside of these archives\nor whatever is you can copy that.\n\n409\n00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.170\nAnd if you use your finders go menu\nyou can choose go to folder and\n\n410\n00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.530\nyou can navigate to that folder.\n\n411\n00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.470\nAnd you can take something like that\nLexmark driver that was in there,\n\n412\n00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.510\nthere's even more appearing.\n\n413\n00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.550\nI'm gonna open up that Lexmark one, and\n\n414\n00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:25.170\nwe can take a look in there and\nthere's the actual PPD file.\n\n415\n00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.000\nActually it's not showing the extension,\nbut anyhow, that's the actual PPD.\n\n416\n00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.520\nIt's not really much to look at.\n\n417\n00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.560\nBut that's that printer driver\nthat's gonna make sure I have that\n\n418\n00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.170\nfull functionality.\n\n419\n00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.110\nAll right,\n\n420\n00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.790\nlet's see how my little installer\nis running here in the background.\n\n421\n00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.180\nLooks like it is done, so\nwe'll go ahead and continue on that.\n\n422\n00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.230\nAnd now it's asking if I want to add this\nto the system preferences printer and\n\n423\n00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.810\nscanner list.\n\n424\n00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:45.440\nI certainly do.\n\n425\n00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.150\nAnd once that's done,\nwe can print a test page.\n\n426\n00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.000\nI will skip out on the test page and\nwe'll finish that.\n\n427\n00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.520\nNow, it wants me to continue online, which\nis the product registration or whatever.\n\n428\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.130\nI'm gonna hit that, but\nI'm not actually going to do it, so\n\n429\n00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.160\nlet's just get out of all that.\n\n430\n00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.100\nAnd now I go back into\nmy System Preferences.\n\n431\n00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.760\nAnd in my System Preferences,\nthere's the HP printer.\n\n432\n00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.960\nAnd look at that icon,\nit looks different than it did before.\n\n433\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.480\nIt's actually showing that second tray\nthat I mentioned was missing before.\n\n434\n00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.870\nNow it's showing up, and\nthere's my HP LaserJet M506.\n\n435\n00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:21.870\nIf I go into my Options and Supplies\nscreen I've got new tabs up here, right?\n\n436\n00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:26.541\nI only had two tabs before, and now when\nI go in here I've got support for Tray 3,\n\n437\n00:21:26.541 --> 00:21:28.348\na Duplex Unit, Tray 4 and 5.\n\n438\n00:21:28.348 --> 00:21:32.820\nI've got my supply levels, I can tell\nthe toner levels that are showing up.\n\n439\n00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.730\nAnd then some kind of printer utility,\nI have no idea what that is.\n\n440\n00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.950\nProbably a utility to work on the printer.\n\n441\n00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.340\nBut all that's been added in\nby having that correct driver.\n\n442\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:43.030\nSo really important that we have that\nif we want to take full advantage of\n\n443\n00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.370\nthe features of that printer.\n\n444\n00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.690\nAll right, the only other thing\nI need to mention on printers,\n\n445\n00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:53.660\nwe kind of tackled in another episode,\nis sharing printers, and\n\n446\n00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.850\nthat if we share a printer other\npeople on the network can access it.\n\n447\n00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.330\nAnd the way sharing works, we really\ndid cover in another episode, but\n\n448\n00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.470\njust to really briefly cover that.\n\n449\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.300\nIn your System Preferences, if you go\nback into your System Preferences and\n\n450\n00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.700\ninto Sharing, you've got\nthe Printer Sharing system right here.\n\n451\n00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.080\nAnd you'll see where I can share out that\noffice printer that I just added and\n\n452\n00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.800\npeople can print to it through me.\n\n453\n00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.730\nNow, that's kind of neat,\nbecause if they print through me,\n\n454\n00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.110\nthey can leverage the fact that\nI have the full driver and\n\n455\n00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.040\nthey can use a generic\ndriver if they want.\n\n456\n00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.742\nBut if my computer gets turned off,\n\n457\n00:22:24.742 --> 00:22:27.654\nthey're not really gonna be\nable to take advantage of that.\n\n458\n00:22:27.654 --> 00:22:31.099\nSo be sure to check out the sharing\nresources shows that we did,\n\n459\n00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:34.640\nand we cover sharing printers\nin much more depth there.\n\n460\n00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.460\nBut a key thing that I\nwant to mention here,\n\n461\n00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.040\nis that the way that\nprinter-sharing works.\n\n462\n00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:45.160\nOn their machine, they will generate\na print job, and they'll send it to you.\n\n463\n00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.970\nAnd on your computer, it will get\ndeposited called the print queue.\n\n464\n00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.810\nAnd once it's written to the print queue,\n\n465\n00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:54.450\nthen you take over and\nyou actually send it to the printer.\n\n466\n00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.500\nSo you're getting involved in\nevery print job that happens.\n\n467\n00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.970\nAnd if something goes wrong with\nthe printer you will continue to\n\n468\n00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.620\nadvertise the printer on the network\nbecause you're sharing it out.\n\n469\n00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.440\nAnd those print jobs will start\nto build up in the queue, right?\n\n470\n00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.000\nAnd the queue is managed by the cups\nsystem, and I can show it to you if I,\n\n471\n00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.210\nlet me drop back to my Terminal.\n\n472\n00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.371\nThere is a hidden folder, so\nin Finder you don't see it but\n\n473\n00:23:17.371 --> 00:23:20.820\nin the Terminal you can browse to /var.\n\n474\n00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.090\nAnd /var is where various files,\n\n475\n00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:26.390\nusually temporary type files go,\nthings like your print queue.\n\n476\n00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.310\nStuff comes and goes in your print queue.\n\n477\n00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.165\nI never say, boy,\nI need to backup my print queue.\n\n478\n00:23:30.165 --> 00:23:31.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because,\n\n479\n00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.540\nsomething should go in the print queue and\n\n480\n00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.345\nthen-\n&gt;&gt; Leave.\n\n481\n00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:34.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and be gone.\n\n482\n00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.150\nSo it shouldn't be there.\n\n483\n00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.220\nAnd Time Machine will actually leave\nout things like the print queue,\n\n484\n00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.850\nbecause it's just supposed\nto be temporary data.\n\n485\n00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:46.310\nBut if you browse in here, eventually I'm\ngonna hit a permissions error, I think.\n\n486\n00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:51.656\nBut inside of /var, you've got /var/spool,\nand that's your printer spool.\n\n487\n00:23:51.656 --> 00:23:54.099\nAnd not just the printer,\nyou'll see other things use it too.\n\n488\n00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:57.444\nFor example, postfix,\nif you're running an email server.\n\n489\n00:23:57.444 --> 00:24:01.671\nIncoming and outgoing email will sit here\nin the queue before it gets deposited\n\n490\n00:24:01.671 --> 00:24:03.410\nwherever it's going, right?\n\n491\n00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.920\nUUCP is used for newsgroups.\n\n492\n00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.970\nWe don't usually use that anymore,\nbut it's there.\n\n493\n00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:14.280\nBut cups has its own folder,\nand that is the printer queue.\n\n494\n00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.080\nAnd I don't have permission\nto get in there.\n\n495\n00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.890\n&gt;&gt; No, you don't.\n\n496\n00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:17.910\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n497\n00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.940\nWell, if Daniel's printing something, and\n\n498\n00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.010\nI don't have permissions to his print job,\nwell, I can't see what it is.\n\n499\n00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.820\nBut if I did,\nif I had permission to get in there,\n\n500\n00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.620\nI could see what he was printing.\n\n501\n00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.316\nAnd now, I can start nosing around\nin other people's data, right?\n\n502\n00:24:30.316 --> 00:24:32.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And he wouldn't even know it because\n\n503\n00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.600\nI'm looking at a print job he sent.\n\n504\n00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.830\nIt's not like he sees me sitting\nat his computer, or there's\n\n505\n00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:40.330\na timestamp on a file that's been updated\ncuz I edited it, there's none of that.\n\n506\n00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.305\nThis was something that's\nalready left his system.\n\n507\n00:24:42.305 --> 00:24:43.700\nHe'd have no way of knowing.\n\n508\n00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.018\nSo I'm blocked.\n\n509\n00:24:45.018 --> 00:24:51.470\nNow, I can drop to a shell with root\naccess, and we can get in that way.\n\n510\n00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.680\nSo there is always a way for\n\n511\n00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.652\nan administrator to get in\nto something if they want.\n\n512\n00:24:54.652 --> 00:24:57.160\nSo it's not a perfect system.\n\n513\n00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.840\nOf course,\nif you've got administrative access,\n\n514\n00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.170\nthen you've already moved past that.\n\n515\n00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:05.900\nBut if we take a look inside of that\nqueue, what you'll see is a cache folder\n\n516\n00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.340\nfor partially written things and\na temp folder, and\n\n517\n00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:13.940\nyou'll see queues that have weird\nlittle name like this, C00064.\n\n518\n00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.150\nAnd depending on how\nmany printers you have,\n\n519\n00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:20.628\nif I have four printers on a four folders\nwith these seemingly random names, okay.\n\n520\n00:25:20.628 --> 00:25:21.587\nThe name is not random.\n\n521\n00:25:21.587 --> 00:25:24.440\nIt's an identifier that Mac OS\nhas attached to the printer.\n\n522\n00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.411\nAnd so every print job that\ngets sent to that HP printer on\n\n523\n00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:29.950\nmy system will end up here,\nand I mean, every.\n\n524\n00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:34.710\nThat means my print jobs,\nas well as print jobs from other people.\n\n525\n00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.170\nNow, it not showing up\nas a directory on mine,\n\n526\n00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.590\nso I might have actually\npicked something wrong.\n\n527\n00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.190\nSo let me send a print job\nto it to generate something.\n\n528\n00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.520\nSo I'm gonna go up here and print.\n\n529\n00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:47.500\nAnd so now,\nI'm in my little document here.\n\n530\n00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.678\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose that printer,\n\n531\n00:25:49.678 --> 00:25:53.130\nI'll stick with the defaults on this one,\nand we'll print it out.\n\n532\n00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.570\nAnd let's see if we can be fast enough\nhere to actually catch, there we go.\n\n533\n00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.720\nThat's my actual queue right there.\n\n534\n00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.990\nSo the file that I was pointing at\na moment ago was actually just a file.\n\n535\n00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.980\nIt was the identifier for this printer.\n\n536\n00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.000\nAnd now, I've got a new folder\nthat's popped up, d00065-001, right?\n\n537\n00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.711\nAnd as I generate more jobs and set up\nmore printers, I might end up seeing 002,\n\n538\n00:26:14.711 --> 00:26:15.740\nand so on.\n\n539\n00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:20.610\nBut right now, if I pull up my listing,\n[LAUGH] it's already gone.\n\n540\n00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:21.270\nI talked too long, urgh!\n\n541\n00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:24.850\n&gt;&gt; From you said, it's meant to be\nvery dynamic data, just in and out.\n\n542\n00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:25.833\n&gt;&gt; It comes and goes, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n543\n00:26:25.833 --> 00:26:26.890\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so that's the queue.\n\n544\n00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:30.516\nThe reason I bring it up here is if\nsomething goes wrong with the printer,\n\n545\n00:26:30.516 --> 00:26:33.677\npeople start printing, and\nit builds up in your queue folder.\n\n546\n00:26:33.677 --> 00:26:36.485\nAnd your queue folder can grow and\ngrow and grow.\n\n547\n00:26:36.485 --> 00:26:39.691\nAnd it can get to the point where you've\nactually got a sizeable amount of your\n\n548\n00:26:39.691 --> 00:26:41.170\ndisk space eaten up by this queue for\n\n549\n00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:43.750\na printer that's not even around anymore,\nright?\n\n550\n00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.290\nObviously, if a printer is gone,\nwe should remove the share.\n\n551\n00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:48.176\nBut if you forget, other people\nmight be trying to print to it and\n\n552\n00:26:48.176 --> 00:26:49.470\nit starts consuming space.\n\n553\n00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.680\nSo you may need to come in here and\nflush this out.\n\n554\n00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.070\nHopefully, you can avoid that.\n\n555\n00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:55.490\nWhen you delete the printer,\nit deletes it's queue.\n\n556\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.560\nBut you can also flush the queue\nfrom the System Preferences.\n\n557\n00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.692\nWhen you go in your System Preferences,\nand then the Printers.\n\n558\n00:27:00.692 --> 00:27:04.960\nIf there's a queue that's building up, you\nhave that option because you can choose\n\n559\n00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.320\nthe printer and you get this nice\nbutton right here, Open Print Queue.\n\n560\n00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:12.260\nAnd you can go in here and see the\ngraphical representation of that queue.\n\n561\n00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.679\nAnd you can even pause the printer from\nhere, which is nice for testing, right?\n\n562\n00:27:15.679 --> 00:27:20.009\nBecause now, I can go,\nI shouldn't let this menu go, in Print.\n\n563\n00:27:20.009 --> 00:27:24.366\nAnd when I print to that printer, the job\nis going to get sent to the printer and\n\n564\n00:27:24.366 --> 00:27:27.700\nis gonna sit there,\nstuck in the queue, right?\n\n565\n00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.975\nAnd as administrator, I can come and\nhit the X and get it out the queue.\n\n566\n00:27:30.975 --> 00:27:35.530\nOr if I'm in the command line, like I am\nhere on the background, I can pull it up.\n\n567\n00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:40.420\nAnd I can see these jobs getting deposited\nin the queue and waiting for me to work.\n\n568\n00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:45.270\nSo see how that d00066-001 reappeared,\nright?\n\n569\n00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.020\nAnd so that's that print job waiting.\n\n570\n00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.810\nAnd as I continue to send more print jobs,\nright, so I'll just print again,\n\n571\n00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:55.926\nand we'll send that one out.\n\n572\n00:27:55.926 --> 00:27:58.621\nRight, so now,\nthere's a second job in the print queue.\n\n573\n00:27:58.621 --> 00:28:01.170\nAnd if I come down here and look, now,\n\n574\n00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.800\nI can see another one of those\nd00 files that's been created.\n\n575\n00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.458\nAnd you know what?\nI thought it incremented the second\n\n576\n00:28:07.458 --> 00:28:10.890\nnumber, but it has incremented that one,\nso I had that a little bit backwards.\n\n577\n00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:11.493\nThat might be the page count.\n\n578\n00:28:11.493 --> 00:28:13.550\nLet me, we will experiment here.\n\n579\n00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:14.139\nI'm curious now.\n\n580\n00:28:14.139 --> 00:28:15.041\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I take it and\n\n581\n00:28:15.041 --> 00:28:19.871\ntell it to send like more than one copy,\nI'm gonna send four copies of this job and\n\n582\n00:28:19.871 --> 00:28:21.520\nwe start to send it.\n\n583\n00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.860\nI'm not sure Apple's filename and\nconvention here, so I'm just curious.\n\n584\n00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.210\nAnd take a look at that, and no.\n\n585\n00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.475\nI have no idea what increment\nthat second part of the number.\n\n586\n00:28:31.475 --> 00:28:31.979\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n587\n00:28:31.979 --> 00:28:32.479\n&gt;&gt; It's increment in this part.\n\n588\n00:28:32.479 --> 00:28:34.079\n&gt;&gt; That's what makes you wonder why they\n\n589\n00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:35.645\neven have the other part.\n\n590\n00:28:35.645 --> 00:28:37.455\n&gt;&gt; But there we go, so\nthat's the print queue.\n\n591\n00:28:37.455 --> 00:28:39.905\nWe don't normally have to interact\nwith it in the file system.\n\n592\n00:28:39.905 --> 00:28:43.465\nUnless there was some job that was like\ntruly stuck in the print queue that you\n\n593\n00:28:43.465 --> 00:28:45.465\ncouldn't remove out from the printer.\n\n594\n00:28:45.465 --> 00:28:47.765\nUsually, it's easier to just\ndelete the printer and re-add it.\n\n595\n00:28:47.765 --> 00:28:49.625\nBut if you've got a ton of\npermissions configured and stuff,\n\n596\n00:28:49.625 --> 00:28:50.725\nthat would be a hassle.\n\n597\n00:28:50.725 --> 00:28:53.761\nSo instead, you can boot to recovery,\ndrop to a shell, and go and\n\n598\n00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:55.264\nknock these files out of there.\n\n599\n00:28:55.264 --> 00:28:58.250\nAnd then when you reboot, the queue will\nbe empty and you'll be back in business.\n\n600\n00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:59.450\nAnd it's hard to do any\ndamage in the queue.\n\n601\n00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:01.983\nLike if you will completely\ndelete the cups folder, right,\n\n602\n00:29:01.983 --> 00:29:03.334\njust blow the whole thing away.\n\n603\n00:29:03.334 --> 00:29:06.990\nWhen the system comes back up,\nit'll recreate it and that would be fine.\n\n604\n00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.425\nA little bit different if you blow away\nwhere the PPDs are, that will be bad,\n\n605\n00:29:09.425 --> 00:29:10.003\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n606\n00:29:10.003 --> 00:29:11.389\n&gt;&gt; But blowing this folder away\n\n607\n00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:13.210\nis really not a big of a deal.\n\n608\n00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:16.538\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, printers obviously\nthey're a part of our lives.\n\n609\n00:29:16.538 --> 00:29:20.037\nIt's like we said in the beginning of\nthe show, in a business environment,\n\n610\n00:29:20.037 --> 00:29:23.770\nprinters are gonna be a lifeblood thing\nthat people will really take seriously.\n\n611\n00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:25.690\nSo make sure that you understand\nhow to work with printers.\n\n612\n00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.791\nNow, Don, I think you've done\na fantastic job of explaining each,\n\n613\n00:29:28.791 --> 00:29:32.428\nevery little facets that you're probably\ngoing to have to deal with when it comes\n\n614\n00:29:32.428 --> 00:29:33.780\nto printers inside of Mac OS.\n\n615\n00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.200\nSo hopefully,\nyou guys got a lot out of this episode.\n\n616\n00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.870\nBut as I look at our clock,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n617\n00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.650\n&gt;&gt; We are well out of time for today.\n\n618\n00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:40.898\nWe do thank you for joining us,\n\n619\n00:29:40.898 --> 00:29:43.257\nbut it looks like it's time for\nus to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n620\n00:29:43.257 --> 00:29:48.002\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie\n&gt;&gt; and I'm Don Pezet.\n\n621\n00:29:48.002 --> 00:29:51.752\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n622\n00:29:51.752 -->

continuing\non our ACSP series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.890\nSo hopefully that's exactly what you're\nlooking for and you have found it.\n\n10\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.950\nJoining us in the

here.\n\n17\n00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:45.832\nAnd this is kinda where we separate,\nwhat is it, the wheat from the chaff?\n\n18\n00:00:45.832 --> 00:00:46.981\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n19\n00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:48.740\n&gt;&gt; The cream of the crop.\n\n20\n00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.000\nBasically when you buy a Mac,\na lot of home users and\n\n21\n00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.420\nindividuals buy Macs because\nthey're very easy, right?\n\n22\n00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.780\nAnd they just work, right?\n\n23\n00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.820\nThat was the motto for many, many years.\n\n24\n00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.060\nBut things do go wrong,\nthings don't always just work and\n\n25\n00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.598\nsometimes we got to just get in and\ntroubleshoot and figure out what happened.\n\n26\n00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:08.050\nWell Apple's kinda direction over the last\nfew years has really been to say,\n\n27\n00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.730\nhey if something goes wrong,\njust take it down to the Apple Store.\n\n28\n00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.180\nTake it down to local Genius Bar,\n\n29\n00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.623\nsome high school zombie kid\nwill help you with the problem.\n\n30\n00:01:15.623 --> 00:01:18.612\nAnd try and get it fixed up or\nusually just erase it for you.\n\n31\n00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:19.749\nAnd then off you go.\n\n32\n00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:20.840\nThat's kinda the plan.\n\n33\n00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.370\nAnd that's fine for individuals,\nbut for businesses, for\n\n34\n00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.900\nenterprises, that doesn't work out so\nwell.\n\n35\n00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.200\nAnd you don't want to be carting machines\ndown to the Apple Store every other day.\n\n36\n00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.500\nIt becomes a bit of a challenge.\n\n37\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.710\nSo, we need to be able to troubleshoot and\nresolve issues ourselves.\n\n38\n00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.190\nAnd in this episode,\nwhich is too much to fit in one episode,\n\n39\n00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.080\nwe're going to take a look at\nsome of the different tools and\n\n40\n00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.510\ntechniques that are available for\ntroubleshooting a Mac.\n\n41\n00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.924\nAnd finding out what's going wrong and\ngetting things back in order.\n\n42\n00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:50.237\nSo we're going to pull back\nthe veil on some of the hidden\n\n43\n00:01:50.237 --> 00:01:54.979\nbehind the scenes stuff in macOS to get\na chance to see the underlying workings.\n\n44\n00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.029\nAnd to see the things that we can do to\navoid having to make that trip down to\n\n45\n00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:59.410\nthe Apple Store.\n\n46\n00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Don, I guess the best\nplace to start would be in the beginning,\n\n47\n00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.840\nSteve Jobs created Mac, and\nwe are going to start at the beginning.\n\n48\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.810\nI open my Mac Book or\nI hit the power button on my Mac, and\n\n49\n00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.650\nit starts up and a process begins.\n\n50\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.880\nI think that's probably the best place for\nus to kick this off.\n\n51\n00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n52\n00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.450\nAnd let me just show you here,\nI'm going to take this Mac.\n\n53\n00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.429\nAnd this is the Mac Mini,\nwe used way back in Episode 2 or\n\n54\n00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.160\nsomething, when we were\nshowing how to install macOS.\n\n55\n00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.337\nSo this is running macOS Sierra.\n\n56\n00:02:32.337 --> 00:02:34.279\nIt's a clean install that really,\n\n57\n00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.720\nI don't think I've installed\neven a single app on this thing.\n\n58\n00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.848\nSo it's just a straight up one.\n\n59\n00:02:38.848 --> 00:02:41.712\nI just cleared the little dialog boxes up\nasking me to turn on auto update which is\n\n60\n00:02:41.712 --> 00:02:43.650\nthe first thing you see when\nyou login the first time.\n\n61\n00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.140\nSo this is pretty much a fresh and\nclean system.\n\n62\n00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.526\nAnd when you get a new Mac, and\nyou press that power button for\n\n63\n00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:54.411\nthe first time, and it boots up,\nwhat all do you see?\n\n64\n00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:55.475\nSo I'm going to reboot this one here.\n\n65\n00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.529\nI'm going to lose my signal, and then\nit'll come up, and we're going to see,\n\n66\n00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:00.049\nwell first off, we're going to hear.\n\n67\n00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.295\nWhen you turn on a Mac,\nit makes that iconic Mac tone,\n\n68\n00:03:03.295 --> 00:03:06.670\nthat boom noise that\nthey call the Mac bong.\n\n69\n00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.967\n&gt;&gt; It is a C major chord.\n\n70\n00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:10.921\n&gt;&gt; A C major chord?\n\n71\n00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:11.527\n&gt;&gt; Yes it is.\n\n72\n00:03:11.527 --> 00:03:12.208\n&gt;&gt; Where did you learn that?\n\n73\n00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:14.770\n&gt;&gt; I watched a documentary on Macs.\n\n74\n00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.690\n&gt;&gt; All right, I call it the Wall-E sound.\n\n75\n00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.980\nBut when it turns on,\nwe see the little Apple logo and\n\n76\n00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.880\nyou see a little bar going across, right?\n\n77\n00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.350\nWell, the bar is just telling you, hey,\nthe Mac is booting, wait a second.\n\n78\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.130\nBut in reality, in the background, there's\na lot that's going on behind the scenes.\n\n79\n00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.250\nActually five steps, five distinct steps,\nthat are going on during the boot process.\n\n80\n00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.470\nAnd we're actually on step 3 already.\n\n81\n00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.615\nAnd all I did was push a power button and\nhere's this Apple going.\n\n82\n00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:43.947\nAnd in a moment it's gonna\nprogress a little further and\n\n83\n00:03:43.947 --> 00:03:45.095\nwe'll see a login screen.\n\n84\n00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:48.055\nBy the time we get to login screen,\nthat's step five.\n\n85\n00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:50.435\nThat it's actually completed\nthe boot process and\n\n86\n00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:53.705\ngone through five distinct\nphases to get us right to here.\n\n87\n00:03:53.705 --> 00:03:59.660\nNow, the thing is something can go wrong\nat any one of these five steps and\n\n88\n00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.880\ncause things not to work\nthe way we expect them to.\n\n89\n00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.790\nAnd if we can identify which of\nthose five steps it is that failed,\n\n90\n00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.710\nwe have different troubleshooting tools\navailable to us to try and resolve that.\n\n91\n00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.907\nNow I will tell you that there does come a\ntime where it's not worth troubleshooting,\n\n92\n00:04:16.907 --> 00:04:17.430\nright?\n\n93\n00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.290\nAnd if it takes me an hour to figure\nout which phase was failing, how\n\n94\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.455\nlong would it have taking me to just boot\nto recovery and restore from time machine?\n\n95\n00:04:26.455 --> 00:04:27.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n96\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.260\n&gt;&gt; Five minutes?\n\n97\n00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.000\n&gt;&gt; We laugh about it, but if you've\ngot a current time machine back up and\n\n98\n00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.400\nyou could boot to,\nlike Daniel said, five minutes.\n\n99\n00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.380\nYou kick off the restore,\nthe restore might take 20 minutes, so\n\n100\n00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.520\nin 25 minutes you can have\nthe computer completely refreshed.\n\n101\n00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.170\nIf it was a software failure,\nthat's gonna fix it and\n\n102\n00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.490\nyou saved yourself a bunch of time.\n\n103\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.566\nIf it was a software failure, with\na hardware failure you've got a different\n\n104\n00:04:48.566 --> 00:04:51.160\nproblem and time machine's\nnot going to help you there.\n\n105\n00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.910\nSo what we'll talk a little\nbit about hardware issues\n\n106\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.220\nhere later in this episode.\n\n107\n00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.840\nBut on the software side, if you got\na current time machine backup, nine\n\n108\n00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.480\ntimes out of ten it's faster to restore\nthe time machine backup, if you got it.\n\n109\n00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.622\nIf you don't, if the time machine\nbackup is out of date and\n\n110\n00:05:06.622 --> 00:05:08.123\nthe user never even setup time machine.\n\n111\n00:05:08.123 --> 00:05:10.155\nLike I never setup time\nmachine on this computer.\n\n112\n00:05:10.155 --> 00:05:12.563\nThen that's not an option for me.\n\n113\n00:05:12.563 --> 00:05:17.306\nAnd my only real options are to format and\nreinstall macOS and\n\n114\n00:05:17.306 --> 00:05:22.250\nlose all my data or\npossibly I could boot into target mode.\n\n115\n00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.980\nIf I boot into target mode,\nwhich we did into early episode, but\n\n116\n00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.100\nyou boot while holding\nthe letter T on the keyboard.\n\n117\n00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.805\nAnd when you boot into target mode,\nnow it becomes an external hard drive.\n\n118\n00:05:30.805 --> 00:05:33.956\nI could hook it up to another computer and\nget my documents off of there, and\n\n119\n00:05:33.956 --> 00:05:36.819\nthen format it, and then re-install macOS,\nand put my data back.\n\n120\n00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:38.240\nSo there's that option.\n\n121\n00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.924\nBut if we've got time machine or\neven iCloud set up,\n\n122\n00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:43.059\na lot of time is just\nwiping the machine and\n\n123\n00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.419\nrestoring can be a lot faster than\ntrying to troubleshoot it out.\n\n124\n00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.527\nBut, I'm kind of poo\npooing this whole episode.\n\n125\n00:05:49.527 --> 00:05:51.089\nDon't watch the rest of this episode,\njust restore and that's it.\n\n126\n00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:52.220\n&gt;&gt; Just go to time machine.\n\n127\n00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.560\n&gt;&gt; But it is a reality.\n\n128\n00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.520\nThat is an option and I do it myself.\n\n129\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.330\nI work with computers every single day and\nwhen I go home at the end of the day,\n\n130\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.140\nI want to relax.\n\n131\n00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.930\nI might want to use a computer, but\nI don't want to troubleshoot a computer.\n\n132\n00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.880\nI don't want to work on it,\njust make it work.\n\n133\n00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.357\nSo I'll restore it at the drop of the hat,\nif I think something's wrong.\n\n134\n00:06:09.357 --> 00:06:11.900\n&gt;&gt; I might not be keeping\ntime machine backups.\n\n135\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.392\nMaybe I'm living life in the fast lane.\n\n136\n00:06:14.392 --> 00:06:18.500\nI said, time machine that's not for\nme, so I might not have that option.\n\n137\n00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that is a reality.\n\n138\n00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.360\nSo, let's talk about the boot process and\n\n139\n00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.920\nwhat's going on at each of these\nstages and see what we can do.\n\n140\n00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.444\nWhen you push the power button,\non your Mac,\n\n141\n00:06:29.444 --> 00:06:32.349\nyou're entering the first\nphase of the boot process.\n\n142\n00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:36.820\nNow, first phase is just called\nthe firmware, or boot ROM.\n\n143\n00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.480\nApple just calls it the firmware.\n\n144\n00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.560\nBasically inside your Mac is\na motherboard, and on the motherboard,\n\n145\n00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.130\nthere is a chip somewhere which\nis usually called a BIOS chip,\n\n146\n00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.380\na Basic Input/Output Operating System.\n\n147\n00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.220\nAnd what that BIOS chip is responsible for\ndoing is enabling all your hardware.\n\n148\n00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.060\nSo when you push the power button,\n\n149\n00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.530\nyou're telling the power supply\nto send power to the motherboard.\n\n150\n00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:57.970\nThe motherboard wakes up.\n\n151\n00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.900\nThen the motherboard wakes up the CPU and\nBIOS chip.\n\n152\n00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.900\nAnd the BIOS chip then reads itself\ninto RAM, so the RAM wakes up also.\n\n153\n00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.710\nAnd then once it's in RAM,\n\n154\n00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.560\nit's able to start initializing\nthe rest of the hardware.\n\n155\n00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.900\nAnd to start the quest to find an\noperating system on your computer, right?\n\n156\n00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.830\nIt's like Star Trek II: The Search for\nSpock.\n\n157\n00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.040\nPush the power button,\nwe gotta search for that operating system,\n\n158\n00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.640\nit could be anywhere.\n\n159\n00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.754\n&gt;&gt; It was III, it's from Star Trek III.\n\n160\n00:07:21.754 --> 00:07:22.316\n&gt;&gt; Was it?\n\n161\n00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:22.963\nII was The Wrath of Khan.\n\n162\n00:07:22.963 --> 00:07:23.555\n&gt;&gt; II was Wrath of Khan.\n\n163\n00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:24.394\n&gt;&gt; I just lost all my Star Trek cred.\n\n164\n00:07:24.394 --> 00:07:25.291\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you did.\n&gt;&gt; Just like that.\n\n165\n00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:26.195\n&gt;&gt; All your street cred.\n\n166\n00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:32.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, now the firmware part\nof the boot is not Apple magic.\n\n167\n00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.710\nIt's actually pretty standard stuff that\njust about every machine out there does.\n\n168\n00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.718\nMost modern computers, and\nwhen I say most, I mean like 99.9%.\n\n169\n00:07:40.718 --> 00:07:42.800\nYou have to have really custom\nhardware to not have this.\n\n170\n00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.620\nAre using an EFI,\nan Extensible Firmware Interface, an EFI\n\n171\n00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.160\nboot process to where the motherboard\ncan locate our operating system.\n\n172\n00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.636\nNow, on a Mac, we've got Intel\nprocessors on Intel motherboard.\n\n173\n00:07:57.636 --> 00:07:59.538\nMotherboard is designed by Apple, but\n\n174\n00:07:59.538 --> 00:08:02.947\nit's all Intel infrastructure built\naround their SDKs and all that.\n\n175\n00:08:02.947 --> 00:08:04.436\nSo it's pretty standard.\n\n176\n00:08:04.436 --> 00:08:08.130\nSo the same thing's happening on\na Windows machine or on a Linux machine.\n\n177\n00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.760\nYou push the power button,\nEFI kicks in, and it starts to look for\n\n178\n00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.090\nthe operating system.\n\n179\n00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.530\nWhat's different is that\nApple hides all that from us.\n\n180\n00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.770\nYou're actually not able\nto interact with the BIOS.\n\n181\n00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.360\nOn a Windows machine, I can power up and\npress F2 or Delete on the keyboard or\n\n182\n00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.050\nsomething crazy like that,\nand get into BIOS.\n\n183\n00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:25.950\nOn a Mac, no.\n\n184\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.050\nAnd that's because on a Windows\nmachine they don't know what\n\n185\n00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.160\nhardware you're gonna have.\n\n186\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.580\nSo you might be swapping out hardware and\nyou've got to configure that.\n\n187\n00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.660\nOn a Mac,\nthey know what hardware you're gonna have.\n\n188\n00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.002\nSo the Bios is already set to exactly\nwhat your hardware needs, and\n\n189\n00:08:38.002 --> 00:08:40.757\nit's not something that you\nneed to mess around with.\n\n190\n00:08:40.757 --> 00:08:44.440\nBut that doesn't mean that it doesn't\nhappen, we just don't normally see it.\n\n191\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.100\nBut one time that we really see the EFI\nBios is that if we push the Power button\n\n192\n00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.460\nand it goes to Startup and\nit looks for a disk to boot off of.\n\n193\n00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.820\nIf it can't find an operating system,\n\n194\n00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.150\nit'll display a folder with\na question mark on the screen.\n\n195\n00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.530\nAnd that little question\nmark is telling you,\n\n196\n00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.610\nhey, I can't find an operating system.\n\n197\n00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.320\nThere's nothing out there, no OS for\nme to find to be able to boot into, right?\n\n198\n00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.620\nAnd that's your indicator that\nyou've got one of two problems.\n\n199\n00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.372\nEither one, your hard drive is\ndisconnected, unhooked, maybe even broken.\n\n200\n00:09:15.372 --> 00:09:17.540\nBut your hard drive is not being detected.\n\n201\n00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.790\nOr two, the hard drive is fine.\n\n202\n00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.340\nIt's the operating system that's missing,\nright?\n\n203\n00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.520\nIf I just bought a brand new hard drive\nthat's blank and put it in this computer\n\n204\n00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.550\nto replace a bad one, when I power on,\nthere's nothing on the hard drive.\n\n205\n00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.130\nI'm going to get the question mark.\n\n206\n00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.420\nSo the thing to do when you\nget that question mark,\n\n207\n00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.940\nthe first thing that I always do,\nis you wanna boot to recovery.\n\n208\n00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.350\nBoot to recovery cuz that's gonna let you\nsee whether you can detect the disks and\n\n209\n00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.440\nfind other things.\n\n210\n00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.730\nNow there's two different forms\nof recovery that we can boot to.\n\n211\n00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.670\nAnd I know we've done at\nleast one here on the show.\n\n212\n00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:55.720\nWhich we covered it at one point, building\na USB installer for MacOS Sierra, right?\n\n213\n00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.260\nI think it was in episode number one,\nthe getting ready episode.\n\n214\n00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.200\nMaybe two, so if you go back to that\nepisode we show how to make a USB key.\n\n215\n00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.990\nWell, save that USB key.\n\n216\n00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.830\nBecause when you have a computer that's\nacting up, you can pop it in there and\n\n217\n00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.910\nyou can boot from the USB key.\n\n218\n00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.220\nThat way, even if the hard drive is\ncompletely missing, you'd still boot up,\n\n219\n00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.520\nand then you can look and see,\nlook, the hard drive's missing.\n\n220\n00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.964\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; And\nget an idea of what's going on in there.\n\n221\n00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.090\nSo that's one way.\n\n222\n00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.950\nThe other way is Internet recovery.\n\n223\n00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:26.150\nOn all the new Macs, Macs made in the last\nthree years, this has been filmed in 2017.\n\n224\n00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.227\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So like anything since 2014,\n\n225\n00:10:29.227 --> 00:10:32.883\nreally should have boot to\nInternet recoveries and option.\n\n226\n00:10:32.883 --> 00:10:38.010\nSo if it boots up in the hard drive as\nblank it'll then look out to the Internet.\n\n227\n00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.720\nIf you're physically plugged in,\nit's ready to go.\n\n228\n00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.530\nIf you've got a wireless connector,\nyou'll have to choose a wireless network.\n\n229\n00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.185\nAnd then it'll reach out to Apple,\nand it'll download recovery from them.\n\n230\n00:10:46.185 --> 00:10:47.810\nIt's slow, right?\n\n231\n00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.910\nIt takes a little while to download the\n600 megs or so of data that it needs, but\n\n232\n00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.210\nit's better than not being able\nto do anything at all, and\n\n233\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.810\nthen you can boot into recovery and\nfind out what's going on, right?\n\n234\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.310\nMaybe your hard drive is just fine.\n\n235\n00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.510\nBut it's got some errors in it, and so\nyou can go into the disk utility, and\n\n236\n00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.080\nyou can do a repair, and\nyou run the disk first aid.\n\n237\n00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.000\nAnd it'll scan the disk, fix the problem,\nand then you boot up, and\n\n238\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.880\neverything's fine.\n\n239\n00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:14.410\nMaybe that was it, right, or\nmaybe you need to reinstall macOS.\n\n240\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.030\nThat's when having that USB\nkey comes in really handy.\n\n241\n00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.100\nYou boot up to it,\nyou go in and you install it.\n\n242\n00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.785\nSo the interesting thing is that when you\npress that Power button, EFI looks for\n\n243\n00:11:23.785 --> 00:11:27.250\nan operating system, and it's gonna\nboot the one that's running macOS,\n\n244\n00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.578\nthe first one that it finds.\n\n245\n00:11:28.578 --> 00:11:32.095\nSo in order to bypass that, even if you\nget the question mark, is that you need to\n\n246\n00:11:32.095 --> 00:11:35.970\nboot so that you can see the options that\nare available for you to choose to boot.\n\n247\n00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:40.650\nSo for example, if I take this machine,\nI'm gonna go ahead and just shut it down.\n\n248\n00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.200\nAnd so it's gonna power off,\nand then what I'm gonna do is\n\n249\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.170\nI'm gonna pretend like hey, I've booted\nit and I got a question mark on this one.\n\n250\n00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.608\nIt didn't find the operating system.\n\n251\n00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:54.425\nSo I'm gonna power it on, and as soon\nas I hear the tone, that little gong,\n\n252\n00:11:54.425 --> 00:11:56.010\nthe C#, whatever,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:56.550\n&gt;&gt; What was it?\n\n254\n00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.530\n&gt;&gt; C Major.\n\n255\n00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:58.950\n&gt;&gt; C Major, whatever.\n\n256\n00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:03.760\nSo whenever I hear the C general, I'm\ngonna hold the Option key on my keyboard.\n\n257\n00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.007\nAnd when I'm holding that Option key on\nthe keyboard, it's gonna tell it look for\n\n258\n00:12:10.007 --> 00:12:12.873\nthe operating system, look for\nthe hard drives that are there, but\n\n259\n00:12:12.873 --> 00:12:14.410\ndon't actually boot.\n\n260\n00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.580\nJust show them to me.\n\n261\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.130\nShow me the list of drives\nthat are available.\n\n262\n00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.270\nAnd I missed it.\n\n263\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.310\nI should be seeing it already.\n\n264\n00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.910\nIt's actually choosing\none to boot right now.\n\n265\n00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.990\nSo since I missed it,\nI'm going to hold that power button.\n\n266\n00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.670\nAnd on a Mac, if you hold the power\nbutton down for ten seconds,\n\n267\n00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.140\nit will power off, right?\n\n268\n00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.680\nSo that's one way to kind of cheat.\n\n269\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.730\nI was busy gabbing and didn't hold\nthe option button soon enough, so\n\n270\n00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:34.469\nI'll do that again.\n\n271\n00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.580\nAnd there we go.\n\n272\n00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.450\nThe other thing is I'm using\na wireless keyboard, and\n\n273\n00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.120\nthe wireless keyboards are good.\n\n274\n00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.460\nThey actually do work, even when you're\nat this low level like this, but\n\n275\n00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.870\nthere are times where they can power off,\nand you don't know it.\n\n276\n00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.320\nAnd it doesn't get the signal there in\ntime, so that can be another problem.\n\n277\n00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.140\nSo you may find that you need to switch\nto a physical keyboard in order to\n\n278\n00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.030\nproperly get this.\n\n279\n00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.280\nAnd I think my keyboard's\nactually powered off.\n\n280\n00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.180\nIt did, darn it.\n\n281\n00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.830\nSo if the keyboard's not on,\nthat'll cause a problem.\n\n282\n00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.070\n&gt;&gt; That would be an issue.\n\n283\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.205\n&gt;&gt; And unfortunately,\nI know what you're saying.\n\n284\n00:13:06.205 --> 00:13:08.310\nDon, why you just don't use\na physical keyboard for this episode?\n\n285\n00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.350\nA lot of us don't buy\nthe physical keyboards anymore.\n\n286\n00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.650\nYou just have the wireless keyboard.\n\n287\n00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.880\nAnd if that's the case you\nneed to make use of it.\n\n288\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.750\nThey do work, it's just is a little\nbit trickier to make sure you get it.\n\n289\n00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.790\nJust know that if you see the Apple and\nyou start to see that bar progressing,\n\n290\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.080\nit's kind of two way at that point,\nyou've already missed it.\n\n291\n00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.920\nNotice this time, there we go, all right.\n\n292\n00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.532\nSo turn your wireless keyboard on and\nthat helps.\n\n293\n00:13:30.532 --> 00:13:31.684\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's part of\n\n294\n00:13:31.684 --> 00:13:32.798\nthe troubleshooting process, right?\n\n295\n00:13:32.798 --> 00:13:34.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so now we boot up,\n\n296\n00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.560\nand what I'm seeing when I look\nhere are my three disks, right?\n\n297\n00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.750\nThere's the Macintosh HD, whoops, sorry.\n\n298\n00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:46.090\nThe Macintosh HD, the Recovery partition,\nand it's on the same hard drive, right?\n\n299\n00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:51.590\nSo it doesn't actually show me here the\nfact that it's two different hard drives,\n\n300\n00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.150\nbut it is one hard drive.\n\n301\n00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.990\nThat's all that I've got in this Mac Mini.\n\n302\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.230\nSo this recovery partition\nis on the same disk.\n\n303\n00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.550\nIf my main disk is failed, the recovery\npartition is normally gone with it.\n\n304\n00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.800\nSo that's not an option for\nme to boot to, right?\n\n305\n00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.490\nBut if it's just some problem with the OS.\n\n306\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.580\nMaybe the OS has gotten corrupted or\neven deleted.\n\n307\n00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.340\nSomebody deleted the system folder.\n\n308\n00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.510\nIt can happen.\n\n309\n00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.620\nYou might not see Macintosh HD but you may\nsee recovery and you can boot to that.\n\n310\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.000\nBut I also see my USB key here,\nthe install MacOS Sierra USB key.\n\n311\n00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.320\nThe one we built back in episode 1 or\n2, and I can boot to that.\n\n312\n00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.600\nBut I've also got a network\nconnection option here.\n\n313\n00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.690\nAnd the reason I've got that is because\nI might want to connect to a wireless\n\n314\n00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:39.160\nnetwork so that I can get out to\nthe Internet and do Internet recovery.\n\n315\n00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.810\nAnd when you do that, if you choose it,\nwhat it's asking you to do is just provide\n\n316\n00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:46.790\nthe password cuz you need that to\nget on the network if it's secured.\n\n317\n00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:51.500\nAnd once you've done that it will be\nable to reach out to Apple, and if you\n\n318\n00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:56.550\ndidn't have the recovery, it would be able\nto get the recovery right from Apple.\n\n319\n00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.330\nOkay, so I'm gonna choose that.\n\n320\n00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.430\nAnd mine doesn't need it because I've\ngot my local recovery right here, and\n\n321\n00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.710\nI've got the USB key.\n\n322\n00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.800\nBut what you'll see on a system that\nsupports Internet recovery is a globe will\n\n323\n00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.380\nappear over here beside it, a fourth icon,\nor a third one if you don't have USB.\n\n324\n00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.950\nThe globe, and\nthat's representing going out to Apple and\n\n325\n00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.640\ngetting it from them, right?\n\n326\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.910\nSo once you boot into recovery,\nthen you've got various options to try and\n\n327\n00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.400\nrepair your operating system like I\nmentioned the disk utility, right?\n\n328\n00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.380\nSo if I choose my recovery partition here.\n\n329\n00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.460\nSo I'm gonna boot off of that and\nit's gonna boot up and\n\n330\n00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.150\nit'll boot into that kind of\na scaled down version of macOS.\n\n331\n00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.768\nIt's about 600 megs in size.\n\n332\n00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.510\nA normal macOS install is a little\nover ten gigs in size, so\n\n333\n00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.070\nwere missing a ton of stuff.\n\n334\n00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.790\nThere's no iMovie and\ngarage band in this thing.\n\n335\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.650\nBut when you get in there,\nit's got the tools we need\n\n336\n00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.600\nto be able to troubleshoot that boot\nprocess and figure out what's going on.\n\n337\n00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.110\nSo we can take a look at what\nour startup disc is set to cuz\n\n338\n00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.070\nyou might have more than one disc and\nit might just be picking the wrong one.\n\n339\n00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.831\nWe can run our disk utility and\ngo into First Aid.\n\n340\n00:15:56.831 --> 00:16:00.362\nWe can reinstall macOS,\nwe can restore from Time Machine.\n\n341\n00:16:00.362 --> 00:16:04.013\nThese are all different things we can do\nIf we're getting that little question mark\n\n342\n00:16:04.013 --> 00:16:04.701\non the folder.\n\n343\n00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:07.453\nAnd those are all errors that would\ncome up basically right after that\n\n344\n00:16:07.453 --> 00:16:09.040\nfirmware process.\n\n345\n00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.820\nNow, while we're waiting on that to boot,\nlet me talk about phase two.\n\n346\n00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.654\nAll right, so phase one was the firmware,\nright, or bootrom.\n\n347\n00:16:15.654 --> 00:16:17.340\nSo that's what we just saw.\n\n348\n00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.420\nPhase two is once we find\nthe operating system,\n\n349\n00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.230\nwe have to get ready to start it, right?\n\n350\n00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.500\nAnd so it calls what's called the booter.\n\n351\n00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.400\nSo step two is the booter.\n\n352\n00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:31.074\nAnd what the booter does is it is\nwhat's actually enabling EFI BIOS.\n\n353\n00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:35.860\nEFI BIOS has two parts,\none part is in a chip on your motherboard.\n\n354\n00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.560\nThat's the traditional\nold BIOS type system.\n\n355\n00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.870\nAnd then the newer advanced EFI part\nactually resides on your hard drive.\n\n356\n00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.855\nWhile waiting on this, I'm just gonna\njump over to my regular laptop, right?\n\n357\n00:16:45.855 --> 00:16:49.456\nSo this is my regular laptop that is\nfunctioning within normal parameters,\n\n358\n00:16:49.456 --> 00:16:51.045\n[LAUGH] as far as I know.\n\n359\n00:16:51.045 --> 00:16:53.225\nAnd I'm gonna jump to\na terminal here real quick.\n\n360\n00:16:53.225 --> 00:16:55.805\nAnd I just wanna show you, you should\nnever have to mess with this file but\n\n361\n00:16:55.805 --> 00:16:57.795\nI do wanna just show you where it is.\n\n362\n00:16:57.795 --> 00:17:01.975\nIf I go into /System/Library,\n\n363\n00:17:01.975 --> 00:17:05.960\ninside of the Library folder,\nthere's a folder called CoreServices.\n\n364\n00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.630\nAnd that CoreServices\nfolder is really important.\n\n365\n00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.110\nIt's got a lot of good stuff in it.\n\n366\n00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:13.039\nThere's a lot of utilities that we\nused to have right in the applications\n\n367\n00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:15.159\nfolder that have now been\nmoved into CoreServices.\n\n368\n00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:18.399\nAnd so you'll find all sorts of\ninteresting things kinda tucked\n\n369\n00:17:18.399 --> 00:17:19.120\naway in here.\n\n370\n00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:24.128\nAnd the one that I wanted to point\nout is it's actually called boot.efi.\n\n371\n00:17:24.128 --> 00:17:30.130\nAnd it's case-sensitive so it is in\nthe lowercase Bs right there, boot.efi.\n\n372\n00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:34.555\nOkay, so when you press your power\nbutton and you go into the bootrom,\n\n373\n00:17:34.555 --> 00:17:37.410\nit's loading the BIOS\npart of your EFI BIOS.\n\n374\n00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.267\nAnd then when you go\ninto the booter stage,\n\n375\n00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:43.090\nit's looking to the hard drive where\nit thinks there's an operating system.\n\n376\n00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.040\nAnd it's looking for boot.efi and\n\n377\n00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.470\nthat's where it's gonna find the hardwares\nor the hard drive side of your EFI BIOS.\n\n378\n00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.684\nSo when it put those two together,\nit's like Reese's Pieces, right?\n\n379\n00:17:52.684 --> 00:17:55.190\nThey go together, now you've got\npeanut butter chocolates, perfect.\n\n380\n00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.780\nAnd now, you're ready to actually\nload the operating system.\n\n381\n00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.040\nThat's step two.\n\n382\n00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.790\nNow, if there's something wrong with\nstep two, how do we troubleshoot it?\n\n383\n00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.230\nThe same way as if something\nis wrong with step one.\n\n384\n00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.130\nThe only difference is on\nstep one on the bootrom side,\n\n385\n00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.380\nwe could have hardware problems\nthat are causing an issue.\n\n386\n00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.230\nBy the time we get to step two\nwhere we're running the booter,\n\n387\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.480\nwe're kinda beyond hardware problems,\nright?\n\n388\n00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.700\nSo any issue getting to boot.efi is\nalmost always gonna be software, right?\n\n389\n00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.650\nCorrupt hard drive,\nmissing files, damage like that.\n\n390\n00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:28.083\nAdditional hard drives that have\nsomehow bumped where this one is at.\n\n391\n00:18:28.083 --> 00:18:31.470\nAnd those are different things that can\ncause the booter process not to work.\n\n392\n00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.330\nBut the booter process is\npretty straightforward.\n\n393\n00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:38.240\nIt's gonna hit this and then it's going to\nlook to actually run the operating system.\n\n394\n00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.730\nNow, the booter is technically\nnot part of the operating system,\n\n395\n00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.830\nit's part of the EFI BIOS, right?\n\n396\n00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.940\nAnd so once the booter initializes, it\nsays hey, I'm sitting right here on this\n\n397\n00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.450\nhard drive and there's an installed\nmacOS right here in this hard drive.\n\n398\n00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.880\nLet's get it turned on.\n\n399\n00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.184\nAnd that's when it moves into step three.\n\n400\n00:18:54.184 --> 00:18:56.107\nAnd step three is the kernel.\n\n401\n00:18:56.107 --> 00:18:57.964\nNow, you probably heard that term before.\n\n402\n00:18:57.964 --> 00:19:02.270\nThe kernel is the heart and\nsoul of an operating system.\n\n403\n00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.770\nIt is what makes\nan operating system works.\n\n404\n00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:09.646\nThe kernel is what allows your software to\ntalk to your hardware, it sits in-between.\n\n405\n00:19:09.646 --> 00:19:13.440\nAnd if it wasn't for the kernel,\nabsolutely nothing would work, right?\n\n406\n00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.870\nWhen we look at macOS, we see this\nbeautiful graphical user interface\n\n407\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.670\nthat is super easy to use and\nis mega convenient.\n\n408\n00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:24.478\nAnd I've said it in other episodes\nunder the hood is BSD Unix.\n\n409\n00:19:24.478 --> 00:19:28.441\nAnd BSD Unix is not user-friendly but\nit's extremely stable and it's very,\n\n410\n00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:29.965\nvery powerful.\n\n411\n00:19:29.965 --> 00:19:36.010\nWell, the kernel that the EFI BIOS is\ngonna launch is the Darwin kernel and\n\n412\n00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:40.160\nDarwin is Apple's version of BSD Unix.\n\n413\n00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.265\nSo in a terminal, if you ever run\nuname -a, that's an old command for\n\n414\n00:19:44.265 --> 00:19:47.337\ndetermining what version\nof Unix you're running.\n\n415\n00:19:47.337 --> 00:19:49.160\nI'm not running Unix, I'm running macOS?\n\n416\n00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.470\nWell, macOS, technically, is Unix.\n\n417\n00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.078\nIn fact, of all the modern\noperating systems out there today,\n\n418\n00:19:55.078 --> 00:19:59.630\nmacOS is the one that probably has\nthe most titled to being called Unix.\n\n419\n00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.756\nThey're the ones that still\nsupports POSIX compliance and\n\n420\n00:20:01.756 --> 00:20:03.690\nall of the other things that\nyou need to be called Unix.\n\n421\n00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:04.770\nA lot of people don't know that.\n\n422\n00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.510\nIt's kind of an interesting thing.\n\n423\n00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.442\n&gt;&gt; So Don, the graphical system that we\nactually interact with on a daily basis.\n\n424\n00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:14.124\nNormally, we click icons,\nmenu buttons and things of that nature.\n\n425\n00:20:14.124 --> 00:20:17.754\nUnix is running that and\nthat's just kind of like an interface for\n\n426\n00:20:17.754 --> 00:20:21.260\nus to talk to without having to\ngo to hear this little terminal.\n\n427\n00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.210\n&gt;&gt; Yep, they call it a window manager and\na desktop compositor.\n\n428\n00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.650\nAnd you don't need to know those,\nit's just that that's what those are.\n\n429\n00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.927\nSo the graphical user interface we\nsee are actually separate components\n\n430\n00:20:28.927 --> 00:20:29.830\nfrom the operating system.\n\n431\n00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.270\nThe operating system is Darwin, BSD Unix.\n\n432\n00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.720\nAnd when you run uname -a,\nthat's what you see.\n\n433\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.640\nYou don't see what version\nof macOS you're running.\n\n434\n00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.465\nI don't see that I'm running macOS 10.12,\n\n435\n00:20:40.465 --> 00:20:44.514\nI see that I'm running the Darwin\nkernel of version 16.6, right?\n\n436\n00:20:44.514 --> 00:20:48.312\nAnd it's dated April 14, 2016.\n\n437\n00:20:48.312 --> 00:20:52.182\nBut wait a minute, no, it's not,\nit's dated April 14th, 2017.\n\n438\n00:20:52.182 --> 00:20:53.084\nThere we go.\n\n439\n00:20:53.084 --> 00:20:54.344\nI was like wait a minute,\nthat's really old.\n\n440\n00:20:54.344 --> 00:20:55.137\n&gt;&gt; Hold on.\n\n441\n00:20:55.137 --> 00:20:59.409\n&gt;&gt; Exactly [LAUGH] April 14th,\nI got my information wrong there but 2017.\n\n442\n00:20:59.409 --> 00:21:02.000\nSo this is less than a month old, right?\n\n443\n00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.995\nIt's part of the puzzle\nthat makes up macOS, right?\n\n444\n00:21:06.995 --> 00:21:11.915\nAnd this kernel is what was launched\nnext to actually get my system up and\n\n445\n00:21:11.915 --> 00:21:15.060\nrunning and going and functioning, right?\n\n446\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.530\nAs far as allowing macOS\nto talk to the hardware.\n\n447\n00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.713\nBut what about the beautiful\nstuff that we see on the screen?\n\n448\n00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:23.460\nWell, the kernel is not a beautiful thing.\n\n449\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.520\nIt is in the background,\nit is launching tasks and\n\n450\n00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.780\nassigning IDs to each task that runs.\n\n451\n00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.230\nAnd it's managing all this,\nmanaging the time slicing and\n\n452\n00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.150\nthe other multitasking functions.\n\n453\n00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.080\nIt's managing all of that.\n\n454\n00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.210\nIt's doing a ton of work and\nit's ugly work, right?\n\n455\n00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.840\nIt's the hard stuff that\ngoes on behind the scenes.\n\n456\n00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.728\nMeanwhile, we've got Aqua in\nthe other parts that make\n\n457\n00:21:43.728 --> 00:21:47.708\nup the graphical user interface\nthat are up and running.\n\n458\n00:21:47.708 --> 00:21:49.616\nAnd making things look pretty and\nthey don't have to work so hard,\n\n459\n00:21:49.616 --> 00:21:51.030\ncuz they're just telling\nthe kernel what to do.\n\n460\n00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.412\nHey, can you do this?\nHey, can you do this?\n\n461\n00:21:52.412 --> 00:21:53.816\nCan you do this?\nAnd in the meanwhile,\n\n462\n00:21:53.816 --> 00:21:55.080\nthey get all the credit.\n\n463\n00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:55.829\n&gt;&gt; They're like middle management.\n\n464\n00:21:55.829 --> 00:21:58.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They really are.\n\n465\n00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:58.567\nI'm a people person.\n\n466\n00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:00.610\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n467\n00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.155\n&gt;&gt; So anyhow,\n\n468\n00:22:01.155 --> 00:22:03.885\nthat's what the kernel is and\nthat's step three, right?\n\n469\n00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:06.620\nSo the bootrom fires up.\n\n470\n00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.490\nIt then launches the booter off of\nthe hard drive that has the OS.\n\n471\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.498\nThe booter then launches the kernel and\n\n472\n00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:17.320\nthe kernel is ready to start\nthe operating system as we know it.\n\n473\n00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.950\nNow before I get to that,\n\n474\n00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:22.840\nlet me go back to my machine here\nthat's booted into recovery.\n\n475\n00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.538\nAnd when we booted into recovery, you're\ngonna see this screen here that gives\n\n476\n00:22:26.538 --> 00:22:29.420\nyou four basic options,\nRestore From Time Machine, right?\n\n477\n00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.728\nSo if my OS is damaged or things aren't\nworking right, that's usually the fastest\n\n478\n00:22:33.728 --> 00:22:36.880\noption to get me back on my feet\nagain as quickly as possible.\n\n479\n00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.698\nOr I can Reinstall macOS.\n\n480\n00:22:38.698 --> 00:22:42.790\nNow, if you choose to reinstall macOS,\ndoes it erase the drive?\n\n481\n00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.935\nNo, it actually doesn't.\n\n482\n00:22:43.935 --> 00:22:46.136\nOkay, if you have all your documents and\nyour data,\n\n483\n00:22:46.136 --> 00:22:49.605\nyour applications are all there on the\ndrive, you can choose to reinstall macOS.\n\n484\n00:22:49.605 --> 00:22:52.040\nAnd it just replaces the operating system.\n\n485\n00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.340\nSo if I think that the boot.efi file\nhas gotten damaged or is missing.\n\n486\n00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.634\nIf I think there's a corrupt\noperating system, right,\n\n487\n00:22:59.634 --> 00:23:01.566\nthen I can quickly reinstall it.\n\n488\n00:23:01.566 --> 00:23:04.209\nAnd now, I know that's not\nthe problem anymore, right?\n\n489\n00:23:04.209 --> 00:23:04.920\nThat's been fixed.\n\n490\n00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.768\nSo that's how we kinda troubleshoot phase\ntwo where we can't get to the boot.efi.\n\n491\n00:23:09.768 --> 00:23:12.803\nYou can Get Help Online\nif you're into reading.\n\n492\n00:23:12.803 --> 00:23:14.330\nAnd then we got the Disk Utility.\n\n493\n00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.017\nNow, the Disk Utility is helpful for\ntwo reasons.\n\n494\n00:23:16.017 --> 00:23:18.478\nOne, if I think I've\ngotten disk corruption,\n\n495\n00:23:18.478 --> 00:23:20.950\nI can launch the Disk Utility and\nrun first aid.\n\n496\n00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.456\nWe saw that in an earlier episode.\n\n497\n00:23:22.456 --> 00:23:26.460\nSo that'll scan, correct any errors,\nfix permissions and things of that nature.\n\n498\n00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.190\nOr two, if I want to do a truly\nclean install of macOS,\n\n499\n00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.170\nI can go to the Disk Utility and\nerase my hard drive.\n\n500\n00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.999\nAnd if you erase the hard drive,\nnow you know it's empty.\n\n501\n00:23:34.999 --> 00:23:38.102\nAnd now,\nyou can go up here to Reinstall macOS and\n\n502\n00:23:38.102 --> 00:23:40.460\nyou're back in business there too.\n\n503\n00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.351\nAll right, now it's less common but\nwhen you're in recovery like this,\n\n504\n00:23:44.351 --> 00:23:46.308\nyou can go up to your Utilities menu.\n\n505\n00:23:46.308 --> 00:23:50.730\nAnd in the Utilities menu, you've got\nthe Network Utility for troubleshooting.\n\n506\n00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:52.160\nIf you can't do Internet recovery for\n\n507\n00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.630\nsome reason, you could launch the Network\nUtility and try and find out why.\n\n508\n00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.290\nAlthough, you're in\nrecovery at this point.\n\n509\n00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.480\nSo you really wouldn't worry about it.\n\n510\n00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.315\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I don't know, it's there.\n\n511\n00:24:01.315 --> 00:24:03.191\nBut more importantly,\nyou can get to the Terminal.\n\n512\n00:24:03.191 --> 00:24:06.189\nAnd so if there's any commands or\nutilities, or things like that,\n\n513\n00:24:06.189 --> 00:24:09.397\nthat you're trying to run That you\ndon't have access to here in the GUI,\n\n514\n00:24:09.397 --> 00:24:11.252\ncuz there's only four options, right?\n\n515\n00:24:11.252 --> 00:24:14.913\nThat we can drop to the Terminal,\nand in the Terminal,\n\n516\n00:24:14.913 --> 00:24:18.190\nyou'll be able to go in and\naccess other things.\n\n517\n00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.410\nSo if you watched our password\nrecovery episode, we went in and\n\n518\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.840\ndid password resets, and\nwe did it via the Terminal here.\n\n519\n00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.550\nAnd anything else, you can copy files,\nyou can run other checks,\n\n520\n00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.400\nyou can test the networking,\n\n521\n00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.712\nyou can look for missing disks, although\nthe disk utility is easier for that.\n\n522\n00:24:33.712 --> 00:24:38.000\nSo there's all sorts of different stuff\nthat you can do right from the terminal.\n\n523\n00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.350\nAnd you'll have access into\nthe system to be able to do that.\n\n524\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.570\nAll right, so that's kind of what's\ngoing on there in recovery and\n\n525\n00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:47.330\nwe talked about phase 1 and\nphase 2 and phase 3, right?\n\n526\n00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:53.210\nNow phase 1 was the boot RAM, phase 2\nis the booter, phase 3 was the kernel.\n\n527\n00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:58.270\nNow when the kernel initializes, it's up\nand running, right, on my laptop here.\n\n528\n00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.160\nMy kernel is up and running,\nand doing it's job, right?\n\n529\n00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.730\nBut the kernel then says okay,\nlet's get this thing ready for\n\n530\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.330\nthe end user,\nthe person who's gonna muck all this up.\n\n531\n00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:11.390\nAnd they fire up what's called launchd.\n\n532\n00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.570\nLaunchd is the launch daemon.\n\n533\n00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.400\nAnd a daemon, I know, it's not evil.\n\n534\n00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.215\n&gt;&gt; It's this evil little impish\nthing with a pitchfork, right?\n\n535\n00:25:19.215 --> 00:25:21.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the Unix term for\n\n536\n00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.990\nany service that runs in the background,\nright?\n\n537\n00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.950\nIt's stuff that runs in\nthe background that we don't see.\n\n538\n00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:26.390\nSo launchd is one of those.\n\n539\n00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:27.540\nIn fact, it's not just one of those.\n\n540\n00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.280\nIt's the first one that\nruns on your system.\n\n541\n00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:36.152\nWhen the kernel powers on,\nlaunchd is the very first thing that runs.\n\n542\n00:25:36.152 --> 00:25:38.280\nIf you were to go into\nyour system monitor, so\n\n543\n00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.853\nlet me pull up my system monitor.\n\n544\n00:25:41.161 --> 00:25:42.390\nSorry, activity monitor.\n\n545\n00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:43.449\nLet me get my terminology right.\n\n546\n00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.300\nWhen you go in the activity monitor,\n\n547\n00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.390\nyou can see all the processes that\nare running on your system, right?\n\n548\n00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:55.230\nSo here I see all those and over here\nyou'll see where they have a PID and\n\n549\n00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.700\nPID is a Process ID.\n\n550\n00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.950\nEvery time a process runs,\nit gets an ID number.\n\n551\n00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:04.270\nSo we can tell them apart cuz if I run\nSafari twice, how do we tell them apart?\n\n552\n00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.050\nThey have two different process IDs.\n\n553\n00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:07.785\nActually, not sure if it'll\nlet you run Safari twice.\n\n554\n00:26:07.785 --> 00:26:09.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But in many applications,\n\n555\n00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.600\nyou can run twice, and\nit'll give them different process IDs.\n\n556\n00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.170\nWell, if I sort by process ID, and\nI look at process ID number 0, right?\n\n557\n00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:20.800\nWell, 0 is the kernel,\nshows as kernel_task, right?\n\n558\n00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.380\nSo any task the kernel operates.\n\n559\n00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.590\nThe kernel itself is actually not a task,\n\n560\n00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:28.340\nwhich is why it doesn't get a true\nID number, and it ends up with 0.\n\n561\n00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.440\nAnd look at who is process ID number 1.\n\n562\n00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.570\nThe very next process I run,\nlaunchd, right there, right?\n\n563\n00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:38.370\nLaunchd turns on, and\nit says whoop, let's get busy.\n\n564\n00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:42.880\nIt starts firing up everything else that's\nneeded to start the operating system, and\n\n565\n00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.540\nget us to a login screen.\n\n566\n00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:47.440\nSo it's loading the drivers,\nthe kernel extensions,\n\n567\n00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.550\nits loading the Windows Manager and\n\n568\n00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.160\nthe desktop compositor, its loading\nall of these different components.\n\n569\n00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.350\nThe network driver and\ninitializing the network stack.\n\n570\n00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:55.865\n&gt;&gt; Can you imagine life without launchd?\n\n571\n00:26:55.865 --> 00:26:56.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n572\n00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.040\n&gt;&gt; You would be sitting there going,\n\n573\n00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.680\nokay now I need to run this,\nI need to run that, it'd be horrible.\n\n574\n00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.810\n&gt;&gt; And even back in the old,\nlike the disk operating system days,\n\n575\n00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:10.000\nthe Commodore 64 days,\nwhen you go back to the really old OS's.\n\n576\n00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.250\nOn those you had to create a script\nthat would run when the system\n\n577\n00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.650\nwould boot up that would say do all\nthis stuff to get it ready for me.\n\n578\n00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.865\nAnd launch D technically has that.\n\n579\n00:27:17.865 --> 00:27:22.770\nExcept it's script contains thousands\nof items and it's really crazy\n\n580\n00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:27.600\nlooking at the process id's here,\nif you look at my computer.\n\n581\n00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.590\nWhat am i running, right now?\n\n582\n00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:32.140\nI am running just a couple of programs,\nI'm running like, three programs, right?\n\n583\n00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.440\nAnd if I look at the process IDs, the\nprograms that I'm running should be some\n\n584\n00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.560\nof the most recent things down here,\nright?\n\n585\n00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.660\nSo if I look, well, I get some postgres\nstuff going on, but somewhere in here,\n\n586\n00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.520\nI'll find the applications.\n\n587\n00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.960\nLike, there's the Terminal window\nI opened a minute ago, right?\n\n588\n00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.990\nWhen I opened that Terminal window,\nit was actually process 1484.\n\n589\n00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:54.795\nSo 1484 things have run since I turned\nthis computer on and launched terminal.\n\n590\n00:27:54.795 --> 00:27:56.955\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That would keep me busy, right?\n\n591\n00:27:56.955 --> 00:27:59.670\nLaunchd is really, really busy, but\n\n592\n00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:05.852\nit's launching things to get the system\nup and going and get to a login screen.\n\n593\n00:28:05.852 --> 00:28:09.365\nSo launchd is really launching things\nthat pertain to the system as a whole.\n\n594\n00:28:09.365 --> 00:28:11.190\nLaunchd doesn't care about my terminal.\n\n595\n00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.610\nIt cares about all this other\nstuff that shows up in here.\n\n596\n00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.580\nAll these things that\nare being run by root,\n\n597\n00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.730\nthat's actually launchd that's\nrunning those and firing them up.\n\n598\n00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.096\nThings like this syslogd daemon and\nthe kernal extension daemon,\n\n599\n00:28:23.096 --> 00:28:25.930\nright, cuz it's gotta load\nthose kernel extensions.\n\n600\n00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:29.840\nThe system events daemon,\nit's gotta track all of that.\n\n601\n00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.390\nThat's its job.\n\n602\n00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.700\nSo it's doing that stuff and\nit's taking care of it.\n\n603\n00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:38.460\nNow things can go wrong with launchd and\nyou\n\n604\n00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:43.240\nknow they've gone wrong if you press power\non your Mac, you get your Apple logo.\n\n605\n00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.919\nThe little bar starts to go across and\nthen you don't get to a login screen.\n\n606\n00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.790\nI saw the Apple logo, so that means that\nthe booter was doing its job, right?\n\n607\n00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.170\nAnd that it was looking to the hard drive.\n\n608\n00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:57.120\nAnd if it didn't find boot.efi, it would\nhave got the question mark on the screen.\n\n609\n00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.220\nBut I got the Apple logo, it started\nto load, and then it freezes, or\n\n610\n00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.890\nit dies before we get to a login screen.\n\n611\n00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.170\nThat's important, right?\n\n612\n00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.470\nIf you don't get to a login screen,\n\n613\n00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:12.320\nthen it's likely a failure right here\nin phase four, because it's launchd.\n\n614\n00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.510\nLaunchd is supposed to run phase five.\n\n615\n00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.700\nPhase five is the login phase.\n\n616\n00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:21.290\nAnd the login phase runs\na service called login window.\n\n617\n00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:25.090\nAnd so if we look here,\nin my list of processes,\n\n618\n00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.790\nI should find that in here somewhere,\nthe login window.\n\n619\n00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:31.010\nEven afer you log in,\nit's still running in the background.\n\n620\n00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.960\nBecause you might have things\nlike fast user switching,\n\n621\n00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.390\nwhere you need to go\nback to the login window.\n\n622\n00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:37.060\nAnd so here it is, I can find it,\nloginwindow, right?\n\n623\n00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.660\nThat's the actual login window that\nlet me log into this stinkin' thing.\n\n624\n00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.420\nAnd if I look, it's process id 123.\n\n625\n00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:48.411\nSo the kernel and ultimately launchd\n\n626\n00:29:48.411 --> 00:29:53.340\nhad to run 122 other programs.\n\n627\n00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.273\nWell, I guess launchd counts as one, so\n\n628\n00:29:55.273 --> 00:29:58.680\n121 other programs and\nany one of those could have failed and\n\n629\n00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.730\nstopped me from getting the login and\nthat would have been in phase four.\n\n630\n00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:08.450\nBut once the login window runs, now I'm\nready to login and that's phase five.\n\n631\n00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:12.200\nAnd we troubleshoot problems in phase four\ndifferently than we troubleshoot problems\n\n632\n00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.150\nin phase five.\n\n633\n00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:15.170\nSo, I wanna show the different\ntechniques that we've got.\n\n634\n00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:18.280\nThat we've got what's called Safe Boot and\nSafe Mode.\n\n635\n00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.370\nAnd they're easy to confuse.\n\n636\n00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:21.480\nThey're both on the exam and\nthey're both in real life.\n\n637\n00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.726\nSo we need to learn how they work.\n\n638\n00:30:22.726 --> 00:30:26.910\nSo, I wanna talk a bit about those to see\nhow we would troubleshoot phase three and\n\n639\n00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:28.500\nPhase four and phase five.\n\n640\n00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.430\nBut I know we're low on time, so\nthat I think is gonna have to wait for\n\n641\n00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:32.360\ngood old part two.\n\n642\n00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, part two's\ngonna be action-packed, definitely.\n\n643\n00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.900\nDon, it's interesting stuff thus far,\nI can't wait to see what else you have\n\n644\n00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.940\nin store for us when it comes\nto troubleshooting our Macs.\n\n645\n00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.440\nDefinitely join us back for that part two,\nand see how that works out.\n\n646\n00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.960\nWell, like Don said, we're kind\nof out of time for this episode.\n\n647\n00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.142\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ncall it a day, thanks for watching.\n\n648\n00:30:49.142 --> 00:30:50.522\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n649\n00:30:50.522 --> 00:30:51.539\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n650\n00:30:51.539 --> 00:30:53.084\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n651\n00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:58.996\n[MUSIC]\n\n652\n00:30:58.996 --> 00:31:02.515\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.291\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:12.934\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n5\n00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:17.124\ngreetings everyone and welcome back\nto another great episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.124 --> 00:00:21.482\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, well, we're continuing\n\n7\n00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:25.312\nwith more on that ASP series,\nspecifically looking at troubleshooting.\n\n8\n00:00:25.312 --> 00:00:27.995\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:29.530\nDon Pezet to help us out with that.\n\n10\n00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.340\nDon, welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.840\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.317\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:33.140\nIn the last episode,\n\n14\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.850\nwe were talking about the boot\nprocess that Mac goes through, right?\n\n15\n00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.100\nWe went through the five step boot process\nthat I'm sure we've all committed to\n\n16\n00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.186\nmemory at this point.\n\n17\n00:00:40.186 --> 00:00:43.930\nBut just to kinda recap,\nwhen you press that power button,\n\n18\n00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.730\nyou go through five different\nsteps of things happening.\n\n19\n00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.940\nAnd we go from the bootrom or the\nfirmware, that's kinda that first step.\n\n20\n00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.050\nAnd then that takes us to our second\nstep which is the booter, right?\n\n21\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.410\nOnce it finds the EFI firmware on\nthe hard drive and it fires that up.\n\n22\n00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.610\nThat moves us to the third step,\n\n23\n00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.300\nwhich is the kernel, the actual\noperating system beginning to launch.\n\n24\n00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.910\nThen that takes us to the two steps that\nI wanna focus on here in this episode.\n\n25\n00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.980\nWhich is launchd, right, the launcher\nkicks in and starts running programs.\n\n26\n00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.850\nAnd then the final step, which is\nthe login window, is presented and\n\n27\n00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.280\nwe're able to log in.\n\n28\n00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.070\nNow, in the earlier steps\ntroubleshooting is really challenging\n\n29\n00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.950\nbecause the operating system is broken.\n\n30\n00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.000\nBut when you have issues with launchd, or\nyou have issues with the login window,\n\n31\n00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.320\nby that point technically your\noperating system is not broken.\n\n32\n00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.990\nIt is running, but\nsomething is going wrong, and stopping it.\n\n33\n00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.960\nAnd nine times out of ten that something\nis going wrong is not Apple's fault.\n\n34\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.810\nIt's normally third party software,right?\n\n35\n00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.047\nWhen you have launchd running, part of\nwhat it does is launches all the drivers\n\n36\n00:01:40.047 --> 00:01:43.141\nand things that are a part of\nwhat a third party presents.\n\n37\n00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:45.800\nAll the kernel extensions and\nall that other good stuff.\n\n38\n00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.790\nAnd if there is a bad kernel extension\nwritten, it can freeze the system.\n\n39\n00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.460\nAnd you'll know it's\na launchd program if you\n\n40\n00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.800\ndon't even get to a login window, right.\n\n41\n00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.540\nIf you don't get to the login window,\n\n42\n00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.480\nthen there's something going\non on the launchd side.\n\n43\n00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.360\nBut if you get to the login window,\nand you type in your password, and\n\n44\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.510\nyou hit the button to log in,\nand then something goes wrong\n\n45\n00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.130\nbefore you get to your desktop,\nthen you know it's a login window problem.\n\n46\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.652\nNow, why does that matter?\n\n47\n00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:13.160\nWell launchd and\n\n48\n00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.155\nlogin window both are responsible for\nlaunching other applications.\n\n49\n00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:22.140\nLaunchd is launching all the applications\nthat run in the background, the daemons.\n\n50\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.270\nThe Unix Services that run in\nthe background on your system.\n\n51\n00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.172\nThe login window is running the\napplications that are tied to your user\n\n52\n00:02:28.172 --> 00:02:28.967\naccount, right?\n\n53\n00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:31.504\nEvery user account has startup\nitems that can launch, and\n\n54\n00:02:31.504 --> 00:02:33.640\nany one of those can cause a problem.\n\n55\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.250\nAnd so on this episode I wanna show\nyou guys how to troubleshoot that.\n\n56\n00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.377\nHow to figure out and\n\n57\n00:02:37.377 --> 00:02:41.685\nfix launchd as well as the login window\nto make it where you're able to get in,\n\n58\n00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:46.158\nlogin, and work on the system again even\nthough it isn't quite working right.\n\n59\n00:02:46.158 --> 00:02:47.175\nSo That's what we got before us.\n\n60\n00:02:47.175 --> 00:02:50.980\n&gt;&gt; All right Don well, that being said,\nwhich one of these should we tackle first?\n\n61\n00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.230\nProbably launchd right?\n\n62\n00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, let's start with launchd.\n\n63\n00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.570\nSo, remember the scenario,\nthat's what's important here.\n\n64\n00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.700\nYou push the power button,\n\n65\n00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.160\nthe apple logo comes up,\nthe little bar starts scrolling across.\n\n66\n00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.730\nAnd then, something happens.\n\n67\n00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.700\nIt just sits there.\n\n68\n00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.310\nIt sits there and you never actually\nget to a login window, right.\n\n69\n00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.360\nThat's our indicator.\n\n70\n00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.030\nWe don't get a question\nmark on the screen,\n\n71\n00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.780\nthat would indicate a problem with\nthe boot process or the hard drive.\n\n72\n00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.500\nBut we actually see the Apple logo.\n\n73\n00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.690\nWe see the bar progressing and\nthen it stops, but\n\n74\n00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.380\nwe don't get anywhere, all right.\n\n75\n00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.770\nWell, what you can do\nis one of two things.\n\n76\n00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.290\nThe first thing is you can try and\nget an idea of where it stopped.\n\n77\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.600\nThe problem with figuring out where it\nstopped is you don't really get to see.\n\n78\n00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.460\nYou see an apple and a little bar going\nacross the bottom, right, it's all hidden.\n\n79\n00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.320\nWhen you boot your Mac, you can actually\nboot into what's called verbose mode,\n\n80\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.060\nwhere it doesn't show the apple,\n\n81\n00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.500\nwhere it actually shows stuff\nscrolling across on the screen.\n\n82\n00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.490\nLet me show you on my Mac here, which\nis just at a black a screen right now.\n\n83\n00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.240\nBut I'm gonna power on my Mac,\n\n84\n00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.380\nand when I do it I'm gonna hold\ncommand V on my keyboard, all right.\n\n85\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.890\nSo I'm gonna push the power button and\nhit command V.\n\n86\n00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.500\nNow while I'm holding command V,\n\n87\n00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.380\nthe system is gonna recognize that,\nand when it boots,\n\n88\n00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.890\nit's gonna boot into verbose mode,\nunless I missed it which apparently I did.\n\n89\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.460\nSo see how we got the little bar?\n\n90\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.710\nThat bar is not terribly informative,\nis it?\n\n91\n00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.640\nIt's not really telling me a whole a lot\nabout what's going on in the system.\n\n92\n00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.156\nSo what I'm gonna have to do is well,\nI'll have to power back off and try again.\n\n93\n00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.874\nI must have turned my keyboard off,\nthere we go.\n\n94\n00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:20.810\nAll right, so let's try this again,\nwe'll go ahead and power that off.\n\n95\n00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.320\nAnd we'll power it back on again,\nholding that command V.\n\n96\n00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.360\nAnd command V doesn't change\nthe boot process one single bit.\n\n97\n00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.664\nAll it does, [SOUND] is it\nsays don't show me that apple.\n\n98\n00:04:33.664 --> 00:04:36.230\nInstead, show me what's really going on,\nall right?\n\n99\n00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.500\nAnd that's nice because if\nthe boot process freezes, right,\n\n100\n00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.460\nthere goes that text rattling by.\n\n101\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.978\nIf the boot process freezes, I can at\nleast see what it was doing when it froze,\n\n102\n00:04:45.978 --> 00:04:46.673\nall right?\n\n103\n00:04:46.673 --> 00:04:48.313\nNow, all of this text,\n\n104\n00:04:48.313 --> 00:04:53.650\na lot of it is just kind of information\nthat doesn't necessarily benefit us.\n\n105\n00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.380\nYou know,\nit's just rattling by as it does things.\n\n106\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.020\nSometimes there's errors in here that\nare okay, right, that it expects to have.\n\n107\n00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.470\nBut if it freezes we get an idea of\nthe last step that it went through, and\n\n108\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.630\nthen we can try and\ntrouble shoot from there.\n\n109\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.990\nBut if everything goes correct,\nit gets through it and\n\n110\n00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.000\nthen it goes into the boot and\nwe get our login window, all right.\n\n111\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.840\nSo verbose mode helps us\nto see where we were at.\n\n112\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.930\nI don't normally mess around with\nverbose mode because most of\n\n113\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.960\nthe time the information you get there is\nreally just useful to Apple tech support.\n\n114\n00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.596\nSo we're trying to fix it on our own.\n\n115\n00:05:23.596 --> 00:05:26.770\nThe verbose mode is not gonna\nquite get us there, all right.\n\n116\n00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.460\nBut what I like to do is to boot\nwithout all the third party stuff.\n\n117\n00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.780\nCuz the third party stuff is\nusually what our problem is.\n\n118\n00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.688\nAnd so that's another thing that we\ncan do when we boot this system up,\n\n119\n00:05:36.688 --> 00:05:38.957\nis you can do what's called a safe boot.\n\n120\n00:05:38.957 --> 00:05:40.860\nI'm gonna shut this back down.\n\n121\n00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.850\nAnd when you do a normal boot,\nit's gonna boot up and\n\n122\n00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.920\nit's gonna load all the third\nparty drivers and other things.\n\n123\n00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.300\nBut if you do a safe boot,\nsafe boot will not.\n\n124\n00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.330\nSafe boot will load the official Apple\nsoftware and not any third party software.\n\n125\n00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.700\nAnd more importantly, it will clear\nthe cache of any third party stuff.\n\n126\n00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.980\nSo any temporary files and\nother things that have been generated,\n\n127\n00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.900\nit will flush that out and\ngive you a good, clean, safe boot.\n\n128\n00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.444\n&gt;&gt; So it's all about minimalistic,\n\n129\n00:06:07.444 --> 00:06:10.808\ntrying to just keep only what you need\nto get the operating system running.\n\n130\n00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:13.920\nAnd therefore if it's a operating system\nproblem you'll know because it won't boot\n\n131\n00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.381\n&gt;&gt; Right, if we do a safe boot and\n\n132\n00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:19.130\nwe get to a login window, we know the\nproblem is with the third party driver.\n\n133\n00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.163\nAnd you can boot to recovery and\n\n134\n00:06:20.163 --> 00:06:22.166\nyou can delete the third party\nkernel extensions, right?\n\n135\n00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:25.585\nThey're in /library/extensions, you can\ngo in there and you can delete them out.\n\n136\n00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:29.305\nBut if you do a safe boot and it still\nwon't log in, then you know you've got\n\n137\n00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:32.405\na problem with the operating system and\nyou need to go in and do a repair.\n\n138\n00:06:32.405 --> 00:06:37.345\nSo, if I press power and hold the Shift\nkey on my keyboard this time,\n\n139\n00:06:38.795 --> 00:06:41.178\n[SOUND] All right, so\nI'm just gonna hold the Shift key.\n\n140\n00:06:41.178 --> 00:06:42.970\nThe Shift key is the secret, right?\n\n141\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.276\nSo as soon as you hear that tone,\nyou hold that Shift key and\n\n142\n00:06:46.276 --> 00:06:48.246\nnow it's booting into safe mode.\n\n143\n00:06:48.246 --> 00:06:49.903\nIt looks very different, doesn't it?\n\n144\n00:06:49.903 --> 00:06:51.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't.\n\n145\n00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.790\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't look different at all.\n\n146\n00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.970\nIt's just leaving things off.\n\n147\n00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:55.660\nSo when you boot,\n\n148\n00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.478\nsometimes it can be difficult to tell\nif you booted into safe mode or not.\n\n149\n00:06:58.478 --> 00:07:01.379\nBut it's leaving off the third\nparty drivers, the third party\n\n150\n00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.860\nkernel extensions in the software,\nso it's just booting the Apple side.\n\n151\n00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.790\nAnd if I do this and I get to a login\nwindow, well, I may have already fixed\n\n152\n00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.450\nthe problem by flushing the caches\nof that third party software.\n\n153\n00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.670\nBut it may still not have.\n\n154\n00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.811\nI might need to boot to recovery and\ndelete the third party stuff.\n\n155\n00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:19.360\nWe're holding shift key after\nthe tone does safe boot.\n\n156\n00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.170\nNow there's another\ntechnology called safe mode.\n\n157\n00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.010\nSafe mode sounds a lot like safe boot.\n\n158\n00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.610\nThe difference is safe boot is\ndesigned for launchd, right?\n\n159\n00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.310\nFor before we log in.\n\n160\n00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.650\nSafe mode is designed for after we log in.\n\n161\n00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.160\nWhen you log in, you've got startup\nitems that are tied to your user, right?\n\n162\n00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.830\nIf we look at my laptop, for example.\n\n163\n00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.730\nLet me go pull up my user account.\n\n164\n00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.700\nIf I go into System Preferences and\nUsers and Groups, and\n\n165\n00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.030\nI take my user account here and\nI look at login items.\n\n166\n00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.900\nWhen I login,\nlook at all the stuff that runs, right?\n\n167\n00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.690\nViscosity, it's a VPN client, Moon,\nthat's a window manager that I use.\n\n168\n00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.833\nVMware Fusion Start Menu,\nwhich I never use.\n\n169\n00:07:56.833 --> 00:08:00.172\nDropbox, Undock,\nthese are all programs I have that run.\n\n170\n00:08:00.172 --> 00:08:03.732\nSome of which I've uninstalled, I don't\nhave Odrive anymore But it's got a little,\n\n171\n00:08:03.732 --> 00:08:06.392\nyellow triangle over here telling\nme it can't find it, right?\n\n172\n00:08:06.392 --> 00:08:08.740\nSo I really shouldn't have that\nin there cuz I don't have it.\n\n173\n00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.666\nAnd this one that's got a GYD or\nsomething, I don't even know what that is,\n\n174\n00:08:11.666 --> 00:08:13.972\nbut it doesn't exist because\nthere's a yellow triangle.\n\n175\n00:08:13.972 --> 00:08:17.770\nSo I can get rid of that, but these\nare all things that run when I log in.\n\n176\n00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.040\nWhat if one of these crashes and\nreboots my computer?\n\n177\n00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.510\nEvery time I log in, the computer's\ngonna reboot, right, that's a problem.\n\n178\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.580\nWell, safe mode says,\n\n179\n00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.410\nwhen you log in, don't run this stuff,\ndon't run these things, right?\n\n180\n00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.190\nSo, it's kind of like safe\nboot with third party drivers.\n\n181\n00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.290\nSafe mode is for you log in with\nthird party software, and it'll say,\n\n182\n00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:37.560\ndon't run these.\n\n183\n00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.720\nYou can do both, you can boot, safe boot,\nand then log in with safe mode, or\n\n184\n00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.290\nyou can do one or the other, right?\n\n185\n00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:47.350\nIf I get to a login screen, I don't need\nsafe boot, I got to the login screen, but\n\n186\n00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.890\nI might still need safe\nmode to troubleshoot it.\n\n187\n00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.170\nNow, those aren't the only\nthings that get left out.\n\n188\n00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.520\nYou might have some additional\nitems on your hard drive\n\n189\n00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.230\nthat launch when you log in.\n\n190\n00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.970\nSo, normally, it's gonna be things that\nare right there in your login preferences,\n\n191\n00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.250\nlike what I was showing you there.\n\n192\n00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.310\nBut you might have what\nare called launch daemons.\n\n193\n00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:11.710\nAnd launch daemons are what are fired up\nby launchd, that are fired up prior login.\n\n194\n00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.249\nSo when you boot into safe boot,\nthose are things that are not getting run.\n\n195\n00:09:14.249 --> 00:09:19.173\nAnd you can find those,\ntheir usually in like\n\n196\n00:09:19.173 --> 00:09:23.588\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons.\n\n197\n00:09:23.588 --> 00:09:26.030\nIf I spell it right, there we go, and so\n\n198\n00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:31.540\nhere's all the Apple launch daemons that\nrun when this system starts up, okay?\n\n199\n00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.905\nAnd that was in\n/Systems/Library/LaunchDaemons, and\n\n200\n00:09:34.905 --> 00:09:38.408\nthird party software is not\nsupposed to write to that folder.\n\n201\n00:09:38.408 --> 00:09:43.203\nThey're supposed to write\nto /Library/LaunchDaemons.\n\n202\n00:09:43.203 --> 00:09:47.472\nAnd if I look in there, you can see\nI've got a number of third party ones.\n\n203\n00:09:47.472 --> 00:09:49.350\nThat Blackmagic software that's powering,\n\n204\n00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.930\nactually it's powering my\nscreen right now that we see.\n\n205\n00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.240\nMy XBox 360 controller,\n\n206\n00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.400\nI think we've talked about that\nin [LAUGH] more than one episode.\n\n207\n00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.640\n&gt;&gt; Mission critical, right?\n\n208\n00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.810\n&gt;&gt; So, Java, right?\n\n209\n00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:03.100\nThese are all add-ons that I've installed\nthat are running when my system starts up.\n\n210\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.850\nAnd so if I do a safe boot,\nnone of these are going to load, right?\n\n211\n00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.780\nThat's the launchd side of things.\n\n212\n00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.380\nOn my user account,\nthere's the startup items, right, so\n\n213\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.640\nthis is what the login window would run.\n\n214\n00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.790\nAnd then there's also what\nare called launch agents.\n\n215\n00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.650\nAnd so\nif I look in the LaunchAgents folder,\n\n216\n00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.690\nhere's things that start\nup with my user account.\n\n217\n00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:29.107\nAnd I'll actually see some duplicates\nhere, things like GPGTools and Chromium,\n\n218\n00:10:29.107 --> 00:10:31.370\nSplashtop, Oracle's Java, right?\n\n219\n00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.550\nSo, similar things there.\n\n220\n00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.470\nSo if I'm having problems with Java,\nit could crash launchd, and\n\n221\n00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.710\nit could crash launch window\ncuz it participates in both.\n\n222\n00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.660\nAnd it can certainly crash, we've seen it.\n\n223\n00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:46.660\nSo when I do safe boot,\nthat's taking care of the launch daemons.\n\n224\n00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.290\nWhen I do safe mode,\nit's taking care of the launch agents.\n\n225\n00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:54.370\nLaunch daemons and launch agents, one\nruns before login, one runs after login.\n\n226\n00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.450\nThe way we do safe mode is\nthe same way as safe boot,\n\n227\n00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.910\nit's just a difference of when\nyou hold the shift key down.\n\n228\n00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.480\nSo, I did safe boot on this machine.\n\n229\n00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.357\nWhen I press the power button, I heard\nthe gong, and I held the shift key, right,\n\n230\n00:11:07.357 --> 00:11:09.137\nand then that did a safe boot.\n\n231\n00:11:09.137 --> 00:11:13.725\nNow when I go to log in, if I type in\nmy username and my password, and so\n\n232\n00:11:13.725 --> 00:11:17.390\nI'll punch in my password\nif I remember it.\n\n233\n00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.624\nSo I'm gonna punch in my password, and\n\n234\n00:11:19.624 --> 00:11:22.748\nthen I'm gonna hold shift\nwhen I press enter to log in.\n\n235\n00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:29.050\nBy holding shift while you log in,\nyou're doing safe mode, okay?\n\n236\n00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.728\nNow, it's important that you hold\nshift after you type your password.\n\n237\n00:11:32.728 --> 00:11:33.479\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n238\n00:11:33.479 --> 00:11:34.081\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise,\n\n239\n00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:35.614\nyour password will be all caps and\n\n240\n00:11:35.614 --> 00:11:38.363\nit probably won't work unless\nyour password's all caps.\n\n241\n00:11:38.363 --> 00:11:42.023\nSo, go ahead and type your password,\nand then hold the shift key down and\n\n242\n00:11:42.023 --> 00:11:44.914\nhit the arrow to log in, or\npress enter on your keyboard.\n\n243\n00:11:44.914 --> 00:11:46.290\nI pressed enter.\n\n244\n00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.210\nAnd now when it logs in,\nI just did a safe mode login.\n\n245\n00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.540\nSo I did safe boot and safe mode.\n\n246\n00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.960\nWe don't normally need to go that far,\nright?\n\n247\n00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.160\nIf you can get to a login screen,\nthen safe boot isn't gonna help you.\n\n248\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.380\nIf you can't get to a login screen,\nthen you need to safe boot, right?\n\n249\n00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.930\nSo, safe boot and safe mode,\ntwo tools to help us with phase four and\n\n250\n00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.890\nphase five of the login process.\n\n251\n00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.107\nThey're part of the system,\neasy enough to run, and\n\n252\n00:12:10.107 --> 00:12:11.646\nthat'll help get you around those.\n\n253\n00:12:11.646 --> 00:12:16.329\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, now I know there's one\nthing that I really have trouble with\n\n254\n00:12:16.329 --> 00:12:19.400\nsometimes on my Mac and\nit's the sleep mode.\n\n255\n00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.690\nEvery now and\nagain my computer will go to sleep.\n\n256\n00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.690\nAnd, typically, it's not a problem,\nbut every now and\n\n257\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.150\nthen I'll have maybe something running,\nand it it can cause issues with that.\n\n258\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:31.320\nSo, how do we work with sleep\nmode to make it most efficient?\n\n259\n00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, so a couple of versions\nago Apple introduced a feature called\n\n260\n00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.780\nPower Nap where the operating\nsystem would go to sleep.\n\n261\n00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:43.850\nAnd certain applications were allowed to\noperate even while the Mac was asleep.\n\n262\n00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.370\nSo, for example,\nif you had Time Machine scheduled.\n\n263\n00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.202\nOnce an hour Time Machine would kinda\nwake the system up a little bit and\n\n264\n00:12:49.202 --> 00:12:49.732\ndo a backup.\n\n265\n00:12:49.732 --> 00:12:52.090\nAnd then put the machine\nback to sleep again, right?\n\n266\n00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.260\nWell, that sounds good, hey,\n\n267\n00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.246\neven if my device goes to sleep,\nit can back things up.\n\n268\n00:12:57.246 --> 00:13:00.715\nBut unfortunately, Power Nap, it actually\ncaused some problems with a number of\n\n269\n00:13:00.715 --> 00:13:03.490\napplications, or a number of\napplications that were running.\n\n270\n00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.159\nAnd they would normally try and\nstop the system from going to sleep, and\n\n271\n00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:07.549\nthe system would go to sleep anyway.\n\n272\n00:13:07.549 --> 00:13:11.283\nAnd so it would cause some problems,\nso Power Nap is a bit of a mixed bag.\n\n273\n00:13:11.283 --> 00:13:15.180\nAnd if you find that applications aren't\nbehaving nicely when the system goes\n\n274\n00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:15.720\nto sleep.\n\n275\n00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.851\nLike when you wake the system back up,\nthe applications are messed up.\n\n276\n00:13:17.851 --> 00:13:21.871\nYou might wanna consider disabling Power\nNap, and you can do that on an individual\n\n277\n00:13:21.871 --> 00:13:25.150\napplication basis or for\nthe operating system as a whole, right?\n\n278\n00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.735\nSo, let me show you here on mine.\n\n279\n00:13:26.735 --> 00:13:31.246\nIf I go into my System Preferences,\ninside of System Preferences you\n\n280\n00:13:31.246 --> 00:13:35.075\ncan go to your Energy Saver\nwhich is the little light bulb.\n\n281\n00:13:35.075 --> 00:13:38.275\nAnd when you go into the Energy Saver,\nright in here you'll see your\n\n282\n00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:41.610\npower settings for when you're on\npower and when you're on battery.\n\n283\n00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:42.910\nI'm on a laptop, so I've got both.\n\n284\n00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.860\nIf you're on a Mac Pro or\n\n285\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.670\nan iMac, then you won't have\nthe Battery option available, right?\n\n286\n00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:53.730\nBut when I choose the Battery option,\nyou'll notice this Enable Power Nap item.\n\n287\n00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.580\nAnd it was there under Power Adapter also,\nEnable Power Nap.\n\n288\n00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.620\nNotice how it's turned on when\nI'm on a power adapter, and\n\n289\n00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:01.780\nit's turned off when I'm on battery.\n\n290\n00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.810\nIt's up to me to choose\nwhich one that I want,\n\n291\n00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:04.940\nright, and I might wanna turn it on both.\n\n292\n00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.350\nBut it says, while sleeping your Mac can\nperiodically check for new mail, calendar,\n\n293\n00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.110\nand other iCloud updates, right?\n\n294\n00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:15.380\nSo it's actually doing certain things,\nand it doesn't mention Time Machine, but\n\n295\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.150\nTime Machine does actually\nrun as a part of that too.\n\n296\n00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.714\nSo, that's all stuff that can\nhappen in the background.\n\n297\n00:14:19.714 --> 00:14:23.774\nAnd if you're worried, if you have some\napplications that aren't quite behaving\n\n298\n00:14:23.774 --> 00:14:26.800\nnicely or whatever, you can come in and\nyou can turn that off.\n\n299\n00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.840\nHere on the Power Adapter side,\n\n300\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.130\nit actually does show\nTime Machine right there.\n\n301\n00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.720\nSo we can backup using Time Machine and\ndo these other things.\n\n302\n00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.980\nIf you're having problems with Power Nap,\nyou can turn that off and\n\n303\n00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.190\nsee if it helps your problem.\n\n304\n00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.330\nRight, you could disable\npowering down all together, but\n\n305\n00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.490\nthat's not always the greatest idea.\n\n306\n00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.638\nBut you can turn that off and\nsee if that works out for you.\n\n307\n00:14:42.638 --> 00:14:46.270\nThe other thing is you'll find many\napplications have that function.\n\n308\n00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.480\nI don't know if I can find one\njust willy-nilly like this,\n\n309\n00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.546\nbut let's say, I don't know,\nmy Serial app, right?\n\n310\n00:14:53.546 --> 00:14:57.510\nIf you do a Get Info, on some apps,\nin their Get Info screen,\n\n311\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:01.410\nthey'll have an option in here where\nyou can enable or disable Power Nap.\n\n312\n00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.670\nAnd so you can say, you know what,\nI don't want you trying to wake up and\n\n313\n00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.450\nrun while the system is partially\noperational cuz it causes a problem.\n\n314\n00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.600\nSo, applications that support\nPower Nap will have that.\n\n315\n00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.670\nAnd you can go in and kinda tweak and\nchange that based on your needs.\n\n316\n00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.150\nYeah, I don't know if my mirroring\nprogram has it, here we go, so\n\n317\n00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.776\nmy mirroring program,\nPrevent App Nap, right?\n\n318\n00:15:21.776 --> 00:15:25.170\nNow, App Nap is a little\ndifferent than Power Nap, okay.\n\n319\n00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.040\nApp Nap is talking about\nthe application specifically,\n\n320\n00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.000\nPower Nap is the whole OS,\nApp Nap is the individual program.\n\n321\n00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.890\nIf this application is\nsitting in the background,\n\n322\n00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.250\njust this application could go to sleep,\nright?\n\n323\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.980\nAnd that will save battery power cuz\nsometimes you get background apps that\n\n324\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.360\nare eating up power.\n\n325\n00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.637\nWell, sometimes you wanna background\napp running at full power, and so\n\n326\n00:15:41.637 --> 00:15:42.583\nwe would wanna turn that off.\n\n327\n00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:46.870\nAnd this one, it's not set, so this one\ncould go to sleep in the background.\n\n328\n00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.680\nIf I choose to prevent it,\nnow this one won't go to sleep.\n\n329\n00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.190\nThis app will always stay awake, which\nwill keep it running at optimal speed,\n\n330\n00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:54.940\nthat may be what I want.\n\n331\n00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.263\nIt usually hurts battery power,\nbut, again, this is up to me.\n\n332\n00:15:57.263 --> 00:16:00.623\nSo, those are some of the options that you\nmight see that have to deal with sleep.\n\n333\n00:16:00.623 --> 00:16:03.564\nAnd usually when I hear somebody\ncome to me, and they say, Don,\n\n334\n00:16:03.564 --> 00:16:05.538\nI keep having problems with this program.\n\n335\n00:16:05.538 --> 00:16:07.942\nEvery time I wake my laptop up,\nthis program is broken.\n\n336\n00:16:07.942 --> 00:16:10.634\nThese are the two things that I look for,\nthe Power Nap settings and\n\n337\n00:16:10.634 --> 00:16:11.560\nthe App Nap settings.\n\n338\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.070\nThat you can go and tweak those and\n\n339\n00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.300\ntypically that will help to\nresolve that type of issue.\n\n340\n00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.664\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don, it also can get a little\nfrustrating when the computer goes to\n\n341\n00:16:18.664 --> 00:16:22.164\nsleep a little quicker than I like or\nit's not going to sleep quick enough.\n\n342\n00:16:22.164 --> 00:16:24.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Can we set those things?\n\n343\n00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.670\nA lot of people complain about this.\n\n344\n00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.530\nThey're like, I'm typing away,\nI step away for just a minute and\n\n345\n00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.340\nnow my computer's gone to sleep.\n\n346\n00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.870\nI wanna adjust that.\n\n347\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.540\n&gt;&gt; I complained about it a lot\nback in the spinning disk days.\n\n348\n00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because if your computer hibernated it\n\n349\n00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.280\nwould write the memory to hard drive.\n\n350\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.350\nWhen you woke it back up it had to\ncopy it all back and it was slow but\n\n351\n00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:47.070\nwith SSD's these days, they can go\nto sleep, they can boot from a cold\n\n352\n00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.600\nboot in under eight seconds they\ncan do some really amazing things.\n\n353\n00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.340\nBut you can tweak all of that it's\nactually in the energy savings screen that\n\n354\n00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.034\nI was on a moment ago, right here,\n\n355\n00:16:56.034 --> 00:16:59.960\nwhere you can tweak whether the display\ngets turned off at a particular period.\n\n356\n00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.420\nYou can set a schedule for\n\n357\n00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:06.810\nwhen you're doing particular types of\nbattery management and power management.\n\n358\n00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.320\nAnd you can tweak all that.\n\n359\n00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.780\nYou can also do it here under desktop and\n\n360\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:14.760\nscreen saver, as far as setting how\nlong before a screen saver activates.\n\n361\n00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.000\nAnd if you set that a little too\naggressively, that can be frustrating.\n\n362\n00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.840\nEspecially if you have where you require\na password on screen saver release.\n\n363\n00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.440\nSo those are all different things\nthat we can tweak to adjust that and\n\n364\n00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.410\nget it operating the way that we want.\n\n365\n00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:34.970\nLet's see, a couple of other things\nto think about I talked about\n\n366\n00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:39.380\nthe log in window phase which is\nthe fifth phase of the boot process.\n\n367\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.780\nThere's kind of an unofficial sixth\nphase which is when you log out again.\n\n368\n00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.100\nWhen you log out that's\nthe log out process.\n\n369\n00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:52.730\nAnd any application that supports\nAuto Save should behave perfectly there.\n\n370\n00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.720\nIf you don't remember way\nback earlier in this series,\n\n371\n00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.190\nwe talked about Apple Auto Save.\n\n372\n00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.960\nWhere a lot of applications even\nif you don't save the document,\n\n373\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.310\nit'll retain what you were working on.\n\n374\n00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.770\nAnd when you log back in, the application\nwill launch right back up again, and\n\n375\n00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:05.660\nthere will be your document.\n\n376\n00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.440\nEven though you never saved it,\nit's all right there saved for you.\n\n377\n00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.540\n&gt;&gt; That has saved me quite a few times,\n\n378\n00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.930\nespecially with when we're writing our\nnotes and stuff, and something happens and\n\n379\n00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.430\nthe computer restarts itself,\nI don't lose anything, it was great.\n\n380\n00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's a great feature, except\nthat sometimes it can lead to problems.\n\n381\n00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.670\nIf the developers haven't\nproperly supported it,\n\n382\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.950\nwhen you log out all of your\napplications are supposed to close.\n\n383\n00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.490\nAnd the ones that auto save are supposed\nto be freezing what they were\n\n384\n00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.060\nworking on in time.\n\n385\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.930\nAnd if they mess up it can stop you\nfrom logging out and the system hangs.\n\n386\n00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:34.620\nRight?\n\n387\n00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.961\nOr when you go to log back in those\napplications are supposed to run again and\n\n388\n00:18:37.961 --> 00:18:42.970\nthey're supposed to pop back up with\nthe data that you are working on.\n\n389\n00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:46.648\nAnd if they don't properly resume\nit can mess you up with logging in.\n\n390\n00:18:46.648 --> 00:18:51.220\nWell, doing a safe mode login, holding\nshift, that takes the log in problem.\n\n391\n00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.150\nBut the log out problem\nis really very difficult\n\n392\n00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.060\nto troubleshoot because\nthe system freezes, it locks.\n\n393\n00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.120\nAnd so you can't launch troubleshooting\nutilities, and if you boot to recovery,\n\n394\n00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.590\nwell at that point,\nyou've forced yourself out.\n\n395\n00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.990\nSo do be careful with that one, just be\naware that if you're logging out, and\n\n396\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.480\nyou see a freeze, pay attention to\nwhat applications were running.\n\n397\n00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.320\nAnd then go and look and say,\ndo they support Auto Save?\n\n398\n00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.580\nYou could try turning off Auto Save.\n\n399\n00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.170\nHere let me show you inside\nof our General Settings.\n\n400\n00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.610\nIf you go into\nSystem Preferences in General.\n\n401\n00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.180\nRight down here, you've got, ask to\nkeep changes when closing documents and\n\n402\n00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.690\nclose windows when quitting an app.\n\n403\n00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:30.880\nIf you check those two,\nit will effectively disable Auto Save.\n\n404\n00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.320\nAnd now, see if you can log out with that\napplication open and does it work fine?\n\n405\n00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.900\nAnd if it does, then you know that\napplication is not quite compatible with\n\n406\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.170\nAuto Save and you can reach out to that\ndeveloper and try and get it fixed.\n\n407\n00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.920\nAll the Apple stuff supports it so it's\nalmost always third party that does this.\n\n408\n00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.016\nSo just be aware of that when you log in,\nyou're using the login window process and\n\n409\n00:19:49.016 --> 00:19:51.610\nwhen you log out it's going\nback to login window.\n\n410\n00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:52.929\nBut launch d is still involved and\n\n411\n00:19:52.929 --> 00:19:56.530\nyou still got those guys that are there so\nif you've done a safe boot\n\n412\n00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.670\nthen you're still in the safe boot even\nafter you log out and log back in.\n\n413\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.470\nYou actually have to\nreboot to do a non-safe\n\n414\n00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.440\nboot to get where you load\nthe third party kernel extension.\n\n415\n00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.022\nSo, I would actually need reboot\nonce I fix the problem to kind\n\n416\n00:20:09.022 --> 00:20:09.680\nof undo that piece.\n\n417\n00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.630\nSo, always be aware of that,\nit all sort of stacks together.\n\n418\n00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:18.510\nAll right, I think I've run through most\nwhat I want to on troubleshooting but\n\n419\n00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.510\nI do want to talk about a few\nother special commands.\n\n420\n00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.390\nWe talk about a few special\ncommands like safe boot,\n\n421\n00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.610\nwhen I boot up I hold the shift key,\nright.\n\n422\n00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:27.580\nWe talked about recovery.\n\n423\n00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.880\nWhen I boot up I hold Cmd+R.\n\n424\n00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.860\nOr selecting a disk to boot from.\n\n425\n00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.970\nI boot up when I hold down option, right.\n\n426\n00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.720\nThose little key combinations are neat.\n\n427\n00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.600\nIt's nice to be able to hold\nthese different combinations and\n\n428\n00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.278\nmake the system behave differently.\n\n429\n00:20:40.278 --> 00:20:42.650\nWe did Cmd+V for booting in verbose mode,\n\n430\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.690\nto see all that text running across\nthe screen to figure out what's going on.\n\n431\n00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.957\nThere's a few others that I want to\nmention just to be thorough, for\n\n432\n00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:52.320\nexample Cmd+S.\n\n433\n00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.380\nYou can actually book\nMac OS to a command line.\n\n434\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.610\nNot many people need to do this but\nif there's a GUI problem, and\n\n435\n00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:02.940\nthe GUI's not working,\nyou can boot straight to a command prompt.\n\n436\n00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:07.438\nIt's called booting into single user\nmode and you boot holding Cmd+S.\n\n437\n00:21:07.438 --> 00:21:11.710\nNow, it's no different than booting your\nrecovery and going into Terminal, except,\n\n438\n00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.980\nyou have no GUI, so\nyou can do that if you need to, but\n\n439\n00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.600\ntypically I'll boot to recovery and\ngo to Terminal, that's how I'll do it.\n\n440\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.291\nWhen you boot to single user mode\nwith Cmd+S, you have no mouse,\n\n441\n00:21:22.291 --> 00:21:26.730\nyou have no Copy and Paste, it's very\nun-user-friendly environment because\n\n442\n00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:30.340\nyou're booting to the bash shell,\nright, you're booting into Unix.\n\n443\n00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.410\nAnd so this is the least user\nfriendly environment you can be in.\n\n444\n00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.830\nAnd there's only so much that you\ncan troubleshoot in there, but\n\n445\n00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.390\nI do want you to be aware\nthat you can do that.\n\n446\n00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.630\nBoot holding Cmd+S.\n\n447\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.350\nIt'll take you to a command prompt,\nyou put in your username and\n\n448\n00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.480\npassword like normal.\n\n449\n00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.530\nAnd now you're accessing the shell on\nyour system with no GUI whatsoever.\n\n450\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:48.785\n&gt;&gt; Better make sure you have that Unix\ncheat sheet available when you do that.\n\n451\n00:21:48.785 --> 00:21:49.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n452\n00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.730\nthen the last one I want to show\nyou is one of my favorites.\n\n453\n00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.400\nBecause it's the one that helps me\nfigure out whether I need to go to\n\n454\n00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.460\nthe Genius Bar.\n\n455\n00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.590\nIf I have a software problem,\nI can fix it myself, any software problem.\n\n456\n00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:03.590\nBecause at a minimum,\nI can format and reinstall, right?\n\n457\n00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.500\nSo a software problem,\nI should never go to\n\n458\n00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.390\nthe Apple Store with a software problem,\nthat should not happen.\n\n459\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.220\nBut a hardware problem, if the device is\nunder warranty, you need to take it in.\n\n460\n00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.050\nSo how do you know if you're\nhaving a hardware problem?\n\n461\n00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.880\nWell you might be able to diagnosis it\nyourself, but because we can't into get\n\n462\n00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.080\ninto Bios, and because Apple protects\na lot that stuff we can't see it.\n\n463\n00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:27.890\nWell there is a hardware diagnostic tool,\nbuilt into every Mac that you buy today.\n\n464\n00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:32.818\nIt's just one of those hidden\naway things that you don't\n\n465\n00:22:32.818 --> 00:22:37.552\nreally know about, so\nlet me show you here on this Mac.\n\n466\n00:22:37.552 --> 00:22:43.160\nLet me get back over to my Mac, and\nI'm gonna take it and shut it down.\n\n467\n00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.890\nSo let me get this thing shutting down.\n\n468\n00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.050\nI'm gonna try and shut it down.\n\n469\n00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:52.080\nAnd I'm gonna boot it back up holding\nthe letter D on your keyboard, okay?\n\n470\n00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.550\nD for diagnosis.\n\n471\n00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:58.650\nNow, the hardware diagnostic tool\nactually changed a few years back, but\n\n472\n00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.130\nit's still accessed the same way.\n\n473\n00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.490\nSo there is an old version of\nthe tool that had a lot more options\n\n474\n00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:04.700\nthan the new version.\n\n475\n00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.720\nIn the old one you could\nchoose to run a small test,\n\n476\n00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.230\na long test you can test just\nthe memory or just the hard drive,\n\n477\n00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.720\nit had all sorts of crazy stuff like\nthat where you can really pick.\n\n478\n00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.720\nThe new one, it just runs.\n\n479\n00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.440\nIt's got one mode.\n\n480\n00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.035\nThey found that everybody always\nran it the same mode anyway and\n\n481\n00:23:19.035 --> 00:23:21.130\nit scans all your hardware and\nlooks for problems.\n\n482\n00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.291\nI'm going to hit the power key and\nthen hold down D on my keyboard.\n\n483\n00:23:26.854 --> 00:23:27.720\nEventually.\n\n484\n00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.290\n&gt;&gt; It'll happen.\n\n485\n00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.050\n&gt;&gt; Did not shut down?\n\n486\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:35.418\nI'm gonna hold power for ten seconds so\nI know the thing turned off.\n\n487\n00:23:35.418 --> 00:23:38.740\n[LAUGH] I'm impatient, there we go.\n\n488\n00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.009\nAnd now I'm gonna power it on.\n\n489\n00:23:44.516 --> 00:23:45.295\nI'm going to try.\n\n490\n00:23:45.295 --> 00:23:46.560\nThere we go.\n\n491\n00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.860\nAlright, listening for my gong there.\n\n492\n00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.830\nI'm going to power it on and\nI'm holding D on the keyboard, okay.\n\n493\n00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:52.833\nNow while holding D,\n\n494\n00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:56.188\nthe system will recognize that I want\nto run the hardware diagnostics.\n\n495\n00:23:56.188 --> 00:24:01.238\nNow, if it's the old mode or the new\nmode they're both accessed by holding D.\n\n496\n00:24:01.238 --> 00:24:03.840\nNow mine says starting internet recovery.\n\n497\n00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.620\nThat's a good indicator that\nyou're going to be running the new\n\n498\n00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.450\nstyle of hardware diagnostics.\n\n499\n00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:16.080\nThe old method was actually stored on\nthe motherboard, and Apple stopped doing\n\n500\n00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.230\nthat because they wanted to be\nable to tweak it and update it.\n\n501\n00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.660\nAnd they wanted to be able to phone\nhome to Apple to be able to send in your\n\n502\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.970\ninformation, right?\n\n503\n00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:26.490\nSo the new one actually will\nreach out to the Internet,\n\n504\n00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.310\nand that's what it's doing here.\n\n505\n00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.300\nAnd oops, I was going to zoom in,\nbut it's gone now.\n\n506\n00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.560\nAnd then you'll boot, and\n\n507\n00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.570\nyou'll get this guy right here,\nthe Apple Hardware Test okay?\n\n508\n00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.404\nThe old model would boot to a screen,\nthat had about six, or eight buttons, and\n\n509\n00:24:38.404 --> 00:24:39.309\nit was each for testing.\n\n510\n00:24:39.309 --> 00:24:42.415\nYou could choose to run\nthe full diagnostic, or\n\n511\n00:24:42.415 --> 00:24:44.599\nit could pick individual areas.\n\n512\n00:24:44.599 --> 00:24:46.091\nThis one asks me to pick a language.\n\n513\n00:24:46.091 --> 00:24:47.535\n&gt;&gt; And it just runs the full diagnostic,\ndoesn't it?\n\n514\n00:24:47.535 --> 00:24:48.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's basically it.\n\n515\n00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:55.072\nAnd that's fine, if I'm thinking that I've\ngot a hardware issue, and I'm not certain,\n\n516\n00:24:55.072 --> 00:25:00.320\nI can come in here and I can choose this,\nand it will run a battery of tests.\n\n517\n00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.380\nAnd so if you look,\n\n518\n00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.210\nyou'll see we've got my Hardware Profile\nwhere I can see what hardware I have.\n\n519\n00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:09.610\nAnd then my hardware test and there is\nnot a whole lot options here, okay?\n\n520\n00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:14.830\nIn fact there is really just two options,\nthere is to run the test, right?\n\n521\n00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:18.860\nAnd it says it will take about three\nminute or to run the extended test,\n\n522\n00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.930\nthat takes a long time,\nit takes couple of hours, right?\n\n523\n00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:26.080\nThe basic test is gonna check your memory\nyour processor, your mother board,\n\n524\n00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.570\nyour hard drive is gonna do\nquick checks on all that.\n\n525\n00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.860\nThe extended test will actually write and\nread from\n\n526\n00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.790\nevery block of memory in your system,\nso the more RAM you have the longer,\n\n527\n00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:40.020\nit's gonna take and they learn a full\nscan across your hard drive also.\n\n528\n00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.065\nThat takes a long time.\n\n529\n00:25:41.065 --> 00:25:43.240\nSo, if you're about to go to bed.\n\n530\n00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.162\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n531\n00:25:44.162 --> 00:25:45.741\n&gt;&gt; You start that running and then in\nthe morning you can see the results.\n\n532\n00:25:45.741 --> 00:25:49.987\nBut for most of us the regular test, this\nguy right here is gonna be enough for us,\n\n533\n00:25:49.987 --> 00:25:53.310\nand so that's what I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna talk to run that.\n\n534\n00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.640\nThe only other option we got\nto restart and shut down so\n\n535\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.800\nnothing too exciting there.\n\n536\n00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.420\nSo I'm gonna tell it to run and\nnow it's going to run.\n\n537\n00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.752\nAnd I'll give you guys a great example,\nmy laptop,\n\n538\n00:26:01.752 --> 00:26:06.069\nthe one I'm using right here,\na few months ago the headphone jack,\n\n539\n00:26:06.069 --> 00:26:09.428\nif I ever plugged in headphones\nI would hear static.\n\n540\n00:26:09.428 --> 00:26:12.701\nReally bad static, [NOISE] noise,\nright, it's really strange.\n\n541\n00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:16.541\nAnd then after a week or two of that,\ncuz I chose to ignore it.\n\n542\n00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:18.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; After a week or\n\n543\n00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:23.081\ntwo of that the head phone jack stopped\nworking altogether, and not only that,\n\n544\n00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:25.960\nI no longer had a little\nspeaker icon in my menu bar.\n\n545\n00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.000\n&gt;&gt; That's very interesting John\n&gt;&gt; The Mac\n\n546\n00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.090\nno longer saw its sound card at all.\n\n547\n00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:37.210\nSo digitally or physically it was gone and\nthe sound card was missing, and what had\n\n548\n00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:42.370\nhappened is the actual controller for the\nsound card on my motherboard had failed.\n\n549\n00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.622\nAnd the entires sound card was dead,\nI boot into a diagnostic like this, and\n\n550\n00:26:46.622 --> 00:26:51.082\nran it and it said, it looks like there's\nproblem is with your audio hardware.\n\n551\n00:26:51.082 --> 00:26:54.615\nI said okay great, it's under warranty so\nI'll take it down to the shop and\n\n552\n00:26:54.615 --> 00:26:56.197\nget it fixed, and that's that.\n\n553\n00:26:56.197 --> 00:26:59.552\nThis is the tool I used to find it and\nit does save you that trip,\n\n554\n00:26:59.552 --> 00:27:03.690\nbecause if this runs and\nit saves you know your hardware is fine.\n\n555\n00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.140\nThen you know,\nwell it's a software problem.\n\n556\n00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.630\nIf I go down to the Apple store\nthey're just gonna format it\n\n557\n00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:08.880\nand-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n558\n00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.070\n&gt;&gt; They'll restore it from time machine\nif you've got a time machine back up,\n\n559\n00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.600\nwhich then you can do yourself.\n\n560\n00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.076\nOr they'll just reinstall Mac OS\nwhich you can do yourself.\n\n561\n00:27:15.076 --> 00:27:17.100\nSo you can save yourself\na trip to the store,\n\n562\n00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.742\nthis will tell you if there's\na hardware problem or not.\n\n563\n00:27:19.742 --> 00:27:24.067\nA lot of times we might think there's\na hardware problem, and there isn't.\n\n564\n00:27:24.067 --> 00:27:27.357\nThat there's some software problem that's\nmanifesting itself as the hardware,\n\n565\n00:27:27.357 --> 00:27:29.574\nmemory problems are really,\nreally hard to diagnose.\n\n566\n00:27:29.574 --> 00:27:33.869\nBecause they come and go depening on\nwhether or not we're using that particular\n\n567\n00:27:33.869 --> 00:27:37.730\nblock of RAM, running the extended\ntest here is a great way to see that.\n\n568\n00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.888\nAnd it's testing my memory right here,\n\n569\n00:27:39.888 --> 00:27:43.579\nyou can see where it's showing that\nit's been testing that memory.\n\n570\n00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:46.217\nShe kinda looks like it's frozen,\ndoesn't it, the 21 seconds.\n\n571\n00:27:46.217 --> 00:27:50.540\nOne thing worth noting, sometimes\nit'll look like the test freezes, and\n\n572\n00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.120\nusually that's when it's\ntesting your video card, right.\n\n573\n00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.280\nSo I'm plugged into the HDMI port on this,\n\n574\n00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.860\nso it's probably testing the HDMI\nport which will cause it to freeze.\n\n575\n00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.360\nIf that happens just wait it out.\n\n576\n00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.440\nWait a few minutes, it'll usually\nwake back up and continue on and\n\n577\n00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.360\nit'll finish that test.\n\n578\n00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.020\nBut what it's doing is it's checking\nall the hardware and looking for\n\n579\n00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:08.630\nthe hardware issue.\n\n580\n00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:12.730\nSo this is a quick,\neasy way to rule out a hardware issue.\n\n581\n00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.970\nIf you think you're having some\nkind of problem on the system,\n\n582\n00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.750\nyou can do this, and now it'll tell you\nif you got a hardware issue or not.\n\n583\n00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.610\nAnd if you don't, you can go and\nfocus on the software side.\n\n584\n00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:24.020\nSo that's another option\nthat's available to us.\n\n585\n00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.720\nI think that's the only other one that\nI have as far as my boot secrets.\n\n586\n00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:33.410\nYou will find if you go Google out on the\nInternet that a lot of people talk about\n\n587\n00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:36.290\nflashing or\nflushing the PRAM on your system.\n\n588\n00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:40.770\nBack in the day, Macs used to store a lot\nof hardware configuration inside of what\n\n589\n00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.060\nwas called the PRAM.\n\n590\n00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.150\nAnd you could erase the PRAM by holding,\n\n591\n00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.960\nit was like Ctrl+Shift+P or\nsomething like that when you booted.\n\n592\n00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.480\nAnd you'll find many Mac guys swear by it,\nlike you need to do this.\n\n593\n00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:56.330\nBut on Macs made in the last four or five\nyears, the ones that are using EFI bios.\n\n594\n00:28:56.330 --> 00:29:01.750\nFlushing the PRM doesn't really help with\nmuch of anything at all, if your system\n\n595\n00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:05.850\nhas a 3D accelerating card like an NVIDIA\ncard, it can help with those sometimes.\n\n596\n00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.310\nBut your standard Mac doesn't\nreally benefit from it anymore.\n\n597\n00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:11.950\nSo we don't really worry about flushing\nthe PRM booting in the safe boot, or\n\n598\n00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.710\ndoing safe mode boots,\nrunning the hardware diagnostics.\n\n599\n00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:18.460\nThese are the tools that we generally\nwould go to over something like that.\n\n600\n00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.790\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, I'm not gonna kid you around,\n\n601\n00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.951\nthat diagnostic tool was\ndefinitely worth the ticket price.\n\n602\n00:29:22.951 --> 00:29:25.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna memorize that one,\n\n603\n00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.800\njust to hold D, after you hear that chime.\n\n604\n00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.000\nVery nice tool, I mean,\n\n605\n00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.400\nI think of how we're not able to really\nget into the guts of our systems anymore.\n\n606\n00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.960\nSo having that available to us is just\n\n607\n00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.450\na very nice feature that\nApple has given to us.\n\n608\n00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.760\nDon, we've gone through a lot\nof troubleshooting techniques.\n\n609\n00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.946\nAny words of wisdom, parting gifts for\n\n610\n00:29:42.946 --> 00:29:45.538\nour good viewers out there\nas we close it down?\n\n611\n00:29:45.538 --> 00:29:48.512\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think at this point,\nwe've seen a lot about MacOS.\n\n612\n00:29:48.512 --> 00:29:52.145\nWe've learned a lot about what it does and\nhow to support it,\n\n613\n00:29:52.145 --> 00:29:54.790\nremember that nobody's perfect, right?\n\n614\n00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.044\nNothing is perfect, and\neven if the computer was perfect,\n\n615\n00:29:57.044 --> 00:29:59.746\ncoming right out of Apple's factory,\nonce you stick an end user on it,\n\n616\n00:29:59.746 --> 00:30:01.519\nthat's when the real magic happens, right?\n\n617\n00:30:01.519 --> 00:30:02.491\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n618\n00:30:02.491 --> 00:30:03.664\n&gt;&gt; They will find a way to break things.\n\n619\n00:30:03.664 --> 00:30:05.551\nSo just know the tools\nthat are available to you,\n\n620\n00:30:05.551 --> 00:30:07.542\nunderstand what you're\ncapable of discovering.\n\n621\n00:30:07.542 --> 00:30:13.135\nBut always recognize that there's\nno substitute for a good backup.\n\n622\n00:30:13.135 --> 00:30:13.798\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n623\n00:30:13.798 --> 00:30:16.603\n&gt;&gt; If you've got a time machine backup,\nthere's no problem you can't overcome,\n\n624\n00:30:16.603 --> 00:30:17.480\nif you've got a backup.\n\n625\n00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.731\nIf you don't have a backup, that's when\nyou're really stretching and trying to\n\n626\n00:30:20.731 --> 00:30:24.168\nremember every tool that we talked\nabout and all the other crazy things.\n\n627\n00:30:24.168 --> 00:30:26.554\nIt did just resume here,\nif we want to show it real quick.\n\n628\n00:30:26.554 --> 00:30:27.196\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why not, right?\n\n629\n00:30:27.196 --> 00:30:28.379\nYeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We were just sitting there at 21\n\n630\n00:30:28.379 --> 00:30:28.960\nseconds, that was boring.\n\n631\n00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.998\nBut if you take a look at it now,\nit's actually advanced further, and\n\n632\n00:30:32.998 --> 00:30:35.510\nI can see that it's still doing testing.\n\n633\n00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.000\nIt's actually saying it's going\nto take about four minutes now\n\n634\n00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.990\nas it moves forward.\n\n635\n00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:40.880\nAnd it's just gonna\ncontinue doing that and\n\n636\n00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.990\nit'll run through that test and be done.\n\n637\n00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:45.870\nBut just remember we've got all these\ntools available to us, use them wisely.\n\n638\n00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.420\nAnd worst case scenario,\nif you can't solve the problem,\n\n639\n00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.378\nthen you go down to the Apple store and\nthey can help you out there, and\n\n640\n00:30:51.378 --> 00:30:52.807\nmake sure wear your tight jeans.\n\n641\n00:30:52.807 --> 00:30:54.919\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nhopefully the warranty is still [LAUGH].\n\n642\n00:30:54.919 --> 00:30:56.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good to go.\n\n643\n00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.118\nAll right, Don well thanks so much,\nwe appreciate you dropping by.\n\n644\n00:30:59.118 --> 00:31:02.786\nHopefully you good folks out there gotten\na lot out of these couple of episodes\n\n645\n00:31:02.786 --> 00:31:06.915\nwhen it comes to troubleshooting, because\nwell it is a difficult processor that can.\n\n646\n00:31:06.915 --> 00:31:11.267\nDon, hopefully has equipped you with the\nability to make that process a whole lot\n\n647\n00:31:11.267 --> 00:31:13.381\neasier back ups, back ups, back ups.\n\n648\n00:31:13.381 --> 00:31:16.665\nIf you took anything away is is back ups,\nother than that, and\n\n649\n00:31:16.665 --> 00:31:18.400\nthe great diagnostic tool.\n\n650\n00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.650\nVery, very cool stuff.\n\n651\n00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.290\nOther than that it is time for\nus to sign off.\n\n652\n00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:22.780\nWe do thank you for joining us but\n\n653\n00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.670\nfor ITPro TV I have been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n654\n00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:26.365\n&gt;&gt; And I am Don Pezet.\n\n655\n00:31:26.365 --> 00:31:26.872\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n656\n00:31:26.872 --> 00:31:33.955\n[MUSIC]\n\n657\n00:31:33.955 --> 00:31:36.489\nThank you for watching ITPROTV\n\n",
