All right,\n\n7\n00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.220\nwell the Apple Certified Support\nProfessional is designed to\n\n8\n00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.410\nbasically introduce or not so\nmuch introduce but to help people that\n\n9\n00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.650\nare working in environments where\nyou support Apple computers, right.\n\n10\n00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.000\nAnd we were specifically talking\nabout macOS systems, not so much iOS,\n\n11\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.761\nlike iPads and iPhones but people that are\nsupporting iMacs, Mac Minis, MacBook Pros,\n\n12\n00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:38.730\nMacBook Airs, those type of devices they\nall run the macOS operating systems.\n\n13\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.770\nAnd if you're the one responsible for\nhelping those people, you need to\n\n14\n00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.380\nknow the ins and outs, different services\nand software that are part of it and\n\n15\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.990\nthe ways to be able to maintain, manage,\nand troubleshoot those systems and that's\n\n16\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.880\nwhat this series is really all about.\n&gt;&gt; Now you already mentioned a few people,\n\n17\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.210\nbut who else is the show targeted towards?\n&gt;&gt; Well, so\n\n18\n00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.490\nthe main target audience are for\npeople that are already working in IT,\n\n19\n00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.730\nthat are supporting\nnetworks in that have Macs,\n\n20\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.960\nbut I find that it actually works out\nwell for a lot of other people as well.\n\n21\n00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.040\nIt's great for people that are just\ngetting started with macOS.\n\n22\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.380\nI know it's targeted to people\nthat are already in IT but\n\n23\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.320\nhonestly, our first episodes are going\nto be how to get macOS installed and\n\n24\n00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.618\nwe're gonna walk through that process.\n\n25\n00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:19.830\nAnd we will do simple things like how\nto change the wallpaper background or\n\n26\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.100\nwhatever, but that's the most people\nare able to figure out on their own.\n\n27\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.910\nSo, if you're an IT enthusiast and\nyou wanna\n\n28\n00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.840\nget into professionally supporting Mac\nnetworks this is a great place to do it.\n\n29\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.850\nIt's also good for\nWindows system administrators, maybe\n\n30\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.480\nyou work in a Microsoft environment and a\ncouple of your employees now have Macs or\n\n31\n00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.030\na lot of your employees now have Macs,\nright.\n\n32\n00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.790\nThat how it works, they kinda get\na foothold and start to grow and\n\n33\n00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.650\nnow you find yourself in a situation where\nyou are very use to Windows administration\n\n34\n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.130\nbut you've got Macs you\nneed to support as well.\n\n35\n00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.020\nWe tackle that here and\nin fact we have another course is called,\n\n36\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.610\nMac Integration Basics,\nthat really helps with getting Macs to\n\n37\n00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.040\nplay nice with Windows but in this show\nwe're focused entirely on macOS and so\n\n38\n00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.040\nit can help really a large audience.\n&gt;&gt; Is there a certification available for\n\n39\n00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.730\nthe course?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, right, so\n\n40\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.780\nthe title of the course is\nthe Apple Certified Support Professional,\n\n41\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.630\nwhich is ACSP and that directly aligns\nwith Apple's ACSP certification.\n\n42\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.280\nNow there used to be two different\nACSPs that you could get,\n\n43\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.200\nthere was one for the,\nback then it was called OS 10,\n\n44\n00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.119\nso there's the OS 10 support\nessentials and OS 10 server essentials.\n\n45\n00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.950\nWell Apple did away with server\nessentials, now there's just one and\n\n46\n00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.690\nOS 10 got renamed macOS and now we\njust have macOS Support Essentials and\n\n47\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.020\nyou'll hear some people\nstill refer to it that way.\n\n48\n00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.390\nIf you take the official course at\nan Apple training center they call\n\n49\n00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.670\nit macOS Support Essentials, but\n\n50\n00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.326\nwe're tailored towards that certification,\nthe Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n51\n00:02:45.326 --> 00:02:47.290\nYou take this course you\nlearn all the material,\n\n52\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.490\nyou can go to an Apple training center,\nand\n\n53\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.450\nfrom there you can get the certification.\n&gt;&gt; So, in depth\n\n54\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.440\nnow what topics are covered in the course?\n&gt;&gt; The course covers a lot of stuff I\n\n55\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.320\nmentioned that we install macOS, right,\nso we would kind of start off there.\n\n56\n00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.590\nAnd I know some of you\nare probably thinking, boy,\n\n57\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.120\nthat's really easy just installing it but\n\n58\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.190\nthere's actually a number of different\nways that macOS can be installed and a lot\n\n59\n00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.350\nof different things that we need to think\nabout as we're doing that installation.\n\n60\n00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.740\nSo we get a chance to see that, we'll\nalso see how to support user accounts and\n\n61\n00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.280\nmultiple user accounts.\n\n62\n00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.350\nHow to configure networking,\nhow to configure network sharing and\n\n63\n00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.600\nexchanging information between our Macs.\n\n64\n00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.840\nWe'll see system troubleshooting,\n\n65\n00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.770\nwe'll talk about some of the other\nservices that are kinda hidden away in\n\n66\n00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.180\nthe background that we might use\nas part of the administration.\n\n67\n00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.430\nWe'll take a good look at iCloud,\nbecause that's become so important.\n\n68\n00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.730\nWe'll take a good look at Time Machine,\nthe ways that we can back up our Macs and\n\n69\n00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.610\nrestore them very easily and ways that we\ncan even centrally manage that beyond what\n\n70\n00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.930\na normal consumer would have we can\nactually set up a Time Machine server.\n\n71\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.680\nSo, we get a chance to see a lot of\nthe different tools that are available for\n\n72\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.860\nour Macs and keeping it up and\noperational and running nice and smoothly.\n\n73\n00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.090\nAnd then we kind of end the series talking\na little bit more about troubleshooting,\n\n74\n00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.050\ntroubleshooting hardware that we've\nadded and other resources on the system.\n\n75\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.100\nLastly, I just wanna mention\nthat we do highlight security\n\n76\n00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.635\nreally all throughout the series there's\nall sorts of security features built into\n\n77\n00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:07.970\nmacOS that we need to be aware of and\nwe'll learn about them right here.\n\n78\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.882\nAnd I keep saying macOS, we're\nactually focused on macOS High Sierra,\n\n79\n00:04:12.882 --> 00:04:16.839\nthis is the version that's\nfocused on macOS 10.13.\n\n80\n00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.106\nIf you've watched a previous\nversion of this show,\n\n81\n00:04:19.106 --> 00:04:21.165\nwe've done it for\neach of the versions before,\n\n82\n00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:24.768\nthere's always new features that get snuck\nin and so while we don't call out the new\n\n83\n00:04:24.768 --> 00:04:27.963\nfeatures specifically, they're kinda\nsprinkle throughout the series\n\n84\n00:04:27.963 --> 00:04:30.531\nthings that are unique to High Sierra.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Don, now if\n\n85\n00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:34.119\nApple Certified Support Professional\nsounds like a show you'd be interested in\n\n86\n00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:37.775\nand you should be, make sure you check out\nall the episodes in the course library.\n\n87\n00:04:37.775 --> 00:04:41.075\nAnd thank you for watching ITPRO.TV,\nit is binge worthy.\n\n88\n00:04:41.075 --> 00:04:47.802\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

endeavor,\n\n12\n00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:37.840\nour good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n13\n00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.741\nDon, welcome back, how's it going today?\n&gt;&gt; It is going great,\n\n14\n00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:44.640\nready to kick off our\nMac OS High Sierra adventure.\n\n15\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.080\nThis is the very beginning of our series,\nand so\n\n16\n00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.310\nwe're gonna start off with the beginning\nthings that we need to know about.\n\n17\n00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.030\nSo what is the knowledge that we need\nto have in our minds before we go and\n\n18\n00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.070\ntake that dive into High Sierra?\n\n19\n00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.030\nYou'd be surprised as to all the little\noddities that creep up as you\n\n20\n00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.750\nwork with the new release from Apple.\n\n21\n00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.660\nFor the most part,\nit's actually really enjoyable,\n\n22\n00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.190\nthere's a lot of great new features,\na lot of great power there.\n\n23\n00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.320\nBut there are things that are different,\nthings that have changed,\n\n24\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.770\nthings that behave differently\nthan in previous versions of Mac.\n\n25\n00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.939\nSo we need to be familiar with those and\nunderstand that before we take the dive.\n\n26\n00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.839\nThat way,\nwe don't impact the end users, and\n\n27\n00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:19.610\neverybody gets a nice smooth experience.\n\n28\n00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.059\nSo that's what we're gonna be\ndoing right here in this episode.\n\n29\n00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:23.266\n&gt;&gt; You make a great point, Don,\n\n30\n00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.357\nwhen you talk about things, typically,\nwhile you have some familiarity,\n\n31\n00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:27.580\nthere's also some changes.\n\n32\n00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.583\nSo a good place to start is,\nwhat should we know?\n\n33\n00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:34.071\nWhat should we need to know to\nbe prepared to jump into those\n\n34\n00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:35.143\nwaters?\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\n\n35\n00:01:35.143 --> 00:01:36.519\nthere's a couple things that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n36\n00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:42.661\nSome that are cutting edge new, some that\nare just, I'll call them recently new,\n\n37\n00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:47.682\nthat's probably not a good term,\nbut things as simple as the name.\n\n38\n00:01:47.682 --> 00:01:50.725\nThis one is Mac OS 10.13 High Sierra, and\n\n39\n00:01:50.725 --> 00:01:55.963\nthat terminology's a little different\nthan what we had in previous versions.\n\n40\n00:01:55.963 --> 00:02:01.720\nBecause it was was OS 10, or\nMac OS X, X the Roman numeral, OS 10.\n\n41\n00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.603\nIt was OS 10 all the way up through\nEl Capitan, which was 10.11.\n\n42\n00:02:08.603 --> 00:02:12.338\nAnd then starting with 10.12 Sierra,\nit became Mac OS, so\n\n43\n00:02:12.338 --> 00:02:15.280\nthis is High Sierra, we're still Mac OS.\n\n44\n00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.860\nIt's still OS 10 technically under the\nhood, but they just kind of dropped that\n\n45\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.510\nnomenclature, so\nnow it's Mac iOS 10.13 High Sierra.\n\n46\n00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.084\nSo terminology is a little bit different,\nthat's one thing.\n\n47\n00:02:26.084 --> 00:02:29.272\nThere's also some new features, some\nthings that are baked in that are a little\n\n48\n00:02:29.272 --> 00:02:31.020\nbit different than in previous versions.\n\n49\n00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.880\nSo for example, for the longest time,\nwe would always format our disks as Mac OS\n\n50\n00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.900\nextended, or Mac OS extended journaled,\nthat's the Apple HFS plus file system.\n\n51\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.826\nIn High Sierra, we have a new file system\ncalled APFS, the Apple File System,\n\n52\n00:02:45.826 --> 00:02:48.042\nand we'll talk about\nit in a later episode.\n\n53\n00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:51.662\nBut that means we might be seeing\na different file system than we're used to\n\n54\n00:02:51.662 --> 00:02:53.163\nwhen we jump into High Sierra.\n\n55\n00:02:53.163 --> 00:02:57.240\nAnd that's even different from regular\nold Sierra, so a big change there.\n\n56\n00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.765\nWe have a new version of Safari,\nthat impacts some people who use Safari.\n\n57\n00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:05.870\n[LAUGH] I'm not really one of those,\nbut a lot of people do.\n\n58\n00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.520\nSo any time a web browser changes,\nthat changes the end-user's experience.\n\n59\n00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.100\nThere's some video codec support,\nApple has gone all in with 4K support.\n\n60\n00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.520\nSo 4K video renders better under\nHigh Sierra than under previous versions.\n\n61\n00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.070\nSo if you're looking at it and saying,\nI don't really need High Sierra, but\n\n62\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.060\nyou do video work,\nespecially with 4K video, you'll want it,\n\n63\n00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.890\nthat codec improvement is a big deal.\n\n64\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.310\nThere's Metal 2, the graphic\nsubsystem that was introduced in,\n\n65\n00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.838\nI think it was actually\nintroduced in El Capitan.\n\n66\n00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:36.723\nThat helps with games and\n3D rendering that was called Metal,\n\n67\n00:03:36.723 --> 00:03:38.200\nit's the second version of it.\n\n68\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.100\nIt's more optimized for\n\n69\n00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.570\nsome of the graphics cards that\nare available on a Mac Pro.\n\n70\n00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.136\nSo if you've got a Mac Pro,\n\n71\n00:03:44.136 --> 00:03:46.299\nalso known as you being rich.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.012\n&gt;&gt; Then that's\n\n73\n00:03:47.012 --> 00:03:51.050\nanother thing you'll be able to take\nadvantage of inside of High Sierra.\n\n74\n00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.140\nAnd be able to really, really see\nthe graphics performance of your system.\n\n75\n00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.310\nAnother thing to be aware of is not so\nmuch a change, but\n\n76\n00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.975\na notice of impending change,\nnotice of impending doom.\n\n77\n00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:07.470\n32-bit applications, Apple announced\nawhile ago that they were gonna\n\n78\n00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.670\nend support for 32-bit applications\nin the Apple App Store.\n\n79\n00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.213\nWell, they've been warning that it's\ncoming, this is the final warning.\n\n80\n00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:18.836\nIn High Sierra,\nwhenever you launch a 32-bit version,\n\n81\n00:04:18.836 --> 00:04:22.386\nyou're gonna get a warning\nwindow that pops up that says,\n\n82\n00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:26.090\nthis is the last version of\nMac OS to support 32-bit apps.\n\n83\n00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.020\nWhen the next version comes out, so\nwe had 10.12 Sierra, 10.13 High Sierra.\n\n84\n00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.037\nWhen 10.14 Even Higher Sierra comes out-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n85\n00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:38.003\n&gt;&gt; Or Peak Sierra,\n\n86\n00:04:38.003 --> 00:04:41.384\nwhatever they'll call it,\nwhatever the next the one is,\n\n87\n00:04:41.384 --> 00:04:44.385\nit's not gonna have 32-bit app support.\n\n88\n00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:46.245\nSo you're gonna start\ngetting warnings here.\n\n89\n00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:48.695\nAnd the reason I bring\nthat up is your end users,\n\n90\n00:04:48.695 --> 00:04:50.325\nwhen they see a warning,\nwhat do they think?\n\n91\n00:04:50.325 --> 00:04:52.205\nSomething didn't work,\nsomething went wrong.\n\n92\n00:04:52.205 --> 00:04:54.979\nSo we need to make sure that we\neducate people to know, hey,\n\n93\n00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.038\nwe have plans to replace that application.\n\n94\n00:04:57.038 --> 00:04:59.789\nOr, hey, if you don't have plans\nto replace that application,\n\n95\n00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.260\nthen you're going to have\nproblems in the next version.\n\n96\n00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.924\nSo another thing we need to be\naware of getting ready for Sierra.\n\n97\n00:05:04.924 --> 00:05:07.884\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, continuing along the vein of\n\n98\n00:05:07.884 --> 00:05:12.537\nsupport, right, what are the minimum\nrequirements that are for\n\n99\n00:05:12.537 --> 00:05:15.119\nHigh Sierra?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I guess that's a good point,\n\n100\n00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:17.489\nbecause maybe you can't even\nrun High Sierra, right?\n\n101\n00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:21.530\nWell, Apple happens to be one of the best\ncompanies at supporting hardware.\n\n102\n00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.010\nThey support hardware for way longer\nthan any other vendor that's out there.\n\n103\n00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.760\nSo we know that if you get a laptop or\na desktop or whatever that's two,\n\n104\n00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.520\nthree years old,\nit's gonna support the latest OS.\n\n105\n00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.820\nBut what if it's five years old,\nwhat if it's seven years old?\n\n106\n00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.832\nWell, with other vendors,\n\n107\n00:05:36.832 --> 00:05:39.496\nthey don't have to worry about that\nbecause their hardware fails by then.\n\n108\n00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:42.820\nSo you buy a new one and\nnow you can support the new OS.\n\n109\n00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.950\nBut Apple hardware,\nit runs darn near forever, right?\n\n110\n00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.967\nSo if you have an older MacBook,\nif you have an older Mac Mini,\n\n111\n00:05:49.967 --> 00:05:54.397\nor Mac Pro, or something like that,\nis it going to run High Sierra?\n\n112\n00:05:54.397 --> 00:05:56.585\nWell, Apple publishes\nanother website here,\n\n113\n00:05:56.585 --> 00:05:59.160\nI'm gonna pull up their\nwebsite right here.\n\n114\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.060\nThey publish the Mac OS High Sierra\ntechnical specifications,\n\n115\n00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.230\nand I'll put the link to\nthis in the show notes.\n\n116\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.740\nBut basically, they break it down\ninto general requirements and\n\n117\n00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.080\nhardware requirements.\n\n118\n00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.880\nOn the general side, if your current\nMac is running OS 10, 10.8, or later,\n\n119\n00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.710\nthen the odds are, you're going\nto be able to run High Sierra.\n\n120\n00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.530\nRight, cuz on the hardware side, it just\nneeds 2 gigs of RAM it needs about 14 and\n\n121\n00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.970\na half gigs of space if\nyou're doing an upgrade.\n\n122\n00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.600\nOn a clean install,\nit actually needs a little bit less.\n\n123\n00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.990\nYou may need an Apple ID if plan on doing\niCloud sync, you're gonna need it, but\n\n124\n00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.060\nyou don't have to have an Apple ID.\n\n125\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.690\nAnd then they mention needing\nan Internet service provider.\n\n126\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.944\nThere's some features like\niCloud that don't work so\n\n127\n00:06:38.944 --> 00:06:41.987\nwell unless you're connected to\nthe Internet, that's the I in iCloud.\n\n128\n00:06:41.987 --> 00:06:43.927\nBut if you don't use those features,\nyou don't need those,\n\n129\n00:06:43.927 --> 00:06:44.832\nthose are kind of optional.\n\n130\n00:06:44.832 --> 00:06:48.653\nSo really, it just boils down to,\ndo you have 2 gigs of RAM and\n\n131\n00:06:48.653 --> 00:06:51.018\n14.5 gigs of free space, right?\n\n132\n00:06:51.018 --> 00:06:55.270\nNow, you do need a 64-bit processor,\nand that's why they're saying,\n\n133\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.945\nif you can run OS 10.8 or later, that\nwas the first one that was 64-bit only.\n\n134\n00:06:59.945 --> 00:07:04.335\nIn previous versions of Mac OS, they would\nrelease a 32-bit and a 64-bit version.\n\n135\n00:07:04.335 --> 00:07:07.080\nSo if you have hardware that's older and\n\n136\n00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.560\nhas a 32-bit processor in it,\nyou won't be able to run High Sierra.\n\n137\n00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.371\nAnd so Apple helps with that by\nlisting out the specific models.\n\n138\n00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:20.098\nAnd the general rule of thumb is\nthat if your Mac was made in 2011 or\n\n139\n00:07:20.098 --> 00:07:22.718\nnewer, then it'll run High Sierra.\n\n140\n00:07:22.718 --> 00:07:24.894\nThat's six years ago,\nthat's a pretty long time.\n\n141\n00:07:24.894 --> 00:07:27.585\nFive years is considered\nthe maximum window for\n\n142\n00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:29.950\nPC hardware in a business, right?\n\n143\n00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.634\nHome users, they can go as long as\nthey want, right, but in a business,\n\n144\n00:07:32.634 --> 00:07:33.824\nwe usually set it at five years.\n\n145\n00:07:33.824 --> 00:07:38.531\nWell, these go back as far as late 2009,\nright, and\n\n146\n00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:41.967\nthat was nine years ago, right?\n&gt;&gt; That was awhile back.\n\n147\n00:07:41.967 --> 00:07:43.429\n&gt;&gt; That's a big window of time,\n\n148\n00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:44.137\nright there.\n\n149\n00:07:44.137 --> 00:07:46.879\nApple's done a really good job,\nbut back before 2009,\n\n150\n00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:49.098\nthere were systems with 32-bit processors.\n\n151\n00:07:49.098 --> 00:07:51.944\nBack even further, there were\nsystems with PowerPC processors, and\n\n152\n00:07:51.944 --> 00:07:53.950\nthose just aren't supported anymore.\n\n153\n00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.570\nSo as long as you fit that mix,\nthen you'll be able to upgrade and\n\n154\n00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.212\nyou'll be able to run High Sierra.\n&gt;&gt; So Don, do I just have to stick with\n\n155\n00:08:01.212 --> 00:08:04.778\nthis list if I've got one of these\ncomputers then I know that I'm good to go,\n\n156\n00:08:04.778 --> 00:08:06.087\nobviously that does work.\n\n157\n00:08:06.087 --> 00:08:10.391\nBut what if I'm unsure of what actually\nI'm running and I just ask Siri, hey Siri,\n\n158\n00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:13.360\ndoes my computer support this\nnew High Sierra business?\n\n159\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.110\nOr can I check in a more manual way?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know\n\n160\n00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.390\nwhy it's never even occured to me to ask\nSiri, whether or not that would work.\n\n161\n00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.663\nI mean probably.\n&gt;&gt; Probably.\n\n162\n00:08:21.663 --> 00:08:23.354\n&gt;&gt; You can take your serial number and\n\n163\n00:08:23.354 --> 00:08:27.258\nrun it on Apple's website and it'll tell\nyou how much warranty you have left and\n\n164\n00:08:27.258 --> 00:08:29.426\nwhat model your device is so\nyou can do that.\n\n165\n00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:30.873\nIf you can do that,\n\n166\n00:08:30.873 --> 00:08:33.140\nyou can probably ask Siri.\n&gt;&gt; Probably [LAUGH].\n\n167\n00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.908\n&gt;&gt; But honestly,\n\n168\n00:08:33.908 --> 00:08:37.866\nyou can easily find out whether you're\nsupported right from the desktop of your\n\n169\n00:08:37.866 --> 00:08:39.680\nMac, regardless of how old it is.\n\n170\n00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.340\nFor the longest time,\nwe had the About this Mac window, right?\n\n171\n00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.800\nIf you go up to the top-left\nof your screen and\n\n172\n00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.940\nhit that apple that's up there,\nyou'll see About this Mac.\n\n173\n00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.000\nAnd when you click About this Mac it\nbrings up a little pop up, which is this\n\n174\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.710\nguy right here, and it'll tell you what\nversion of macOS you're running right now.\n\n175\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.139\nNow I'm already running\nHigh Sierra on mine, so\n\n176\n00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:02.700\nit tells me I'm running version 10.13.3.\n\n177\n00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.522\nIf you were running 10.8,\nit would say 10.8.\n\n178\n00:09:05.522 --> 00:09:08.420\nThis screen has been around that long.\n\n179\n00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.140\nThen it goes on to tell\nyou exactly what you have.\n\n180\n00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.101\nSo my device here's a MacBook Pro.\n\n181\n00:09:13.101 --> 00:09:14.880\nIt's a 13 inch 2017.\n\n182\n00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.290\nAnd if I look at my list over\nhere it's telling me MacBook Pros\n\n183\n00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.420\nmid 2010 or newer right?\n\n184\n00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.782\nSo in my case I'm good,\nI'm covered under this.\n\n185\n00:09:25.782 --> 00:09:29.290\nI'll be able to do the upgrade.\n\n186\n00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:33.860\nIf I was running something a little older,\nthen I might have a problem.\n\n187\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.780\nSo I can see that right from here and\nI also see whether I have enough memory.\n\n188\n00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.830\nI need two gigs of ram.\n\n189\n00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.990\nWell I've got 16, so I passed that right?\n\n190\n00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.990\nOn the storage side, I need 14 and a half\ngigs of space available to do an upgrade.\n\n191\n00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.170\nIf I click on the Storage tab up here,\n\n192\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.600\nI can see that I've got about\n290 gigs of space available.\n\n193\n00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.550\nThere's plenty.\n\n194\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.960\nOn an older Mac, your drive might be\nsmaller and so you'll see what that is\n\n195\n00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.620\nright here and it'll tell you whether or\nnot you've got enough space.\n\n196\n00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.365\nSo we can see it all right from here\ninside the About this Mac menu.\n\n197\n00:10:04.365 --> 00:10:08.590\nBut there's also more detailed\ninformation, if you really want to see.\n\n198\n00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.298\nFor example,\nmaybe I've got a fusion drive.\n\n199\n00:10:11.298 --> 00:10:13.850\nI just want to know if I\nhave a fusion drive or not.\n\n200\n00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.602\nWe'll talk file systems later and you'll\nfind out why you would need to know that.\n\n201\n00:10:16.602 --> 00:10:21.110\nBut back under the Overview tab, you'll\nsee this button that says System Report.\n\n202\n00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.760\nWhen you go into the System Report,\nthat's when you get the really detailed\n\n203\n00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.620\ninformation, like the actual\nmodel number of my Mac.\n\n204\n00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.569\nI know my Mac said that it\nwas a 2017 MacBook Pro, but\n\n205\n00:10:32.569 --> 00:10:36.360\nhere I can see it's\nactually a MacBookPro14,1.\n\n206\n00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.170\nThat's the true model number of this Mac.\n\n207\n00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.030\nAnd then it's got\nan Intel Core I7 processor.\n\n208\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.872\nYou can start to see the specific details,\nand that's pretty handy.\n\n209\n00:10:45.872 --> 00:10:49.360\nSame thing on the storage side, you can\nbrowse in here and find your storage.\n\n210\n00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.812\nThat will be attached to, usually like the\nSATA or SAS bus, or mine might be NVME.\n\n211\n00:10:54.812 --> 00:10:56.190\nLet's see, there it is.\n\n212\n00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.100\nUnder my NVME, I can see my\nApple SSD that I have attached.\n\n213\n00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.560\nIf you have a spinning disk or\n\n214\n00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.170\nfusion storage, it will show under\nthe SATA or SATA express bus.\n\n215\n00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.300\nYou can spot the disk and\n\n216\n00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.370\nfind out more detailed information\nabout it right there as well.\n\n217\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.920\nAll the information we need is\navailable right here in these tools\n\n218\n00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.525\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n219\n00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:14.510\nThat's nice to know that our\nMacBooks are there for us.\n\n220\n00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.213\nThey've got really easy ways\nto find out this information.\n\n221\n00:11:17.213 --> 00:11:20.210\nWell once I do that, once I figure out,\nyes, my computer is ready.\n\n222\n00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.340\nMy MacBook is just dying for\nthat High Sierra.\n\n223\n00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.530\nIs there anything that I should\ndo to prepare it, to say listen,\n\n224\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.235\nwe have to have a sit-down,\nwe need to talk.\n\n225\n00:11:29.235 --> 00:11:31.760\n[LAUGH] And we're gonna do this\nupgrade to High Sierra and\n\n226\n00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.280\nI wanna make sure that you are fully\naware that this is gonna happen.\n\n227\n00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.770\nIs there anything like\nthat that we need to do?\n\n228\n00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.700\n&gt;&gt; So technically, and\n\n229\n00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.600\nfor most people if you're\nalready running 10.8 or\n\n230\n00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.980\nhigher you can probably just jump\nright into the upgrade, right?\n\n231\n00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.440\nBut it's recommended that you do a few\nthings first, and the main thing,\n\n232\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.290\nthe number one thing that\nyou don't wanna skip on,\n\n233\n00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.960\nif you can avoid it,\nis doing your updates.\n\n234\n00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.850\nYou want to update the operating\nsystem you're running right now.\n\n235\n00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.957\nSo let's say I am running 10.8, okay?\n\n236\n00:11:56.957 --> 00:12:01.050\nWell 10.8 actually had several sub\nreleases all the way up I believe it\n\n237\n00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.030\nwent to 10.8.9.\n\n238\n00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.530\nAnd that one might even have\na four digit number, right,\n\n239\n00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.262\n10.8.9.5 I think on that one.\n\n240\n00:12:06.262 --> 00:12:11.840\nIt had number of upgrades and\nthose updates, they fixed bugs.\n\n241\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.310\nThey fixed problems that might\ncause your upgrade to fail.\n\n242\n00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.630\nSo that's a good idea, is to do all\nthe updates that are available.\n\n243\n00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:22.280\nBut even before doing the updates,\nit's a good idea to backups,\n\n244\n00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.320\nright, back up your device.\n\n245\n00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.770\nIf for some reason the upgrade fails,\nor maybe the upgrade works perfect, but\n\n246\n00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:34.145\nthen some program you depend on won't run\nunder High Sierra, well you can roll back.\n\n247\n00:12:34.145 --> 00:12:36.990\nYou can use Time Machine to restore your\nsystem back to the previous version of\n\n248\n00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.845\nmacOS.\n\n249\n00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:39.185\nAnd now you're back up and running.\n\n250\n00:12:39.185 --> 00:12:41.565\nSo I always tell people to take a backup,\nright?\n\n251\n00:12:41.565 --> 00:12:43.825\nUse Time Machine or\nif you use third-party software, use that.\n\n252\n00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:47.655\nBut take a backup of your system and\nthen do your updates.\n\n253\n00:12:47.655 --> 00:12:49.965\nThe easiest way to do the updates, well,\n\n254\n00:12:49.965 --> 00:12:52.185\nthe easiest way is if you have\nautomatic updates turned on.\n\n255\n00:12:52.185 --> 00:12:53.950\nWe'll talk about that\nin the update episode.\n\n256\n00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.510\nMost Macs automatically update so\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n257\n00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.570\nBut you can do it a few different ways.\n\n258\n00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.951\nIf you go up to your Apple menu up top and\ntake a look in here,\n\n259\n00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:05.381\nyou can go into your System Preferences.\n\n260\n00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:09.409\nAnd inside of System Preferences,\nyou'll see a system preference for\n\n261\n00:13:09.409 --> 00:13:11.110\nthe App Store, right?\n\n262\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.054\nAnd when you go into\nthe App Store preferences,\n\n263\n00:13:13.054 --> 00:13:16.270\nhere's where you can see if you've got\nautomatic updates turned on, right?\n\n264\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.600\nI do.\n\n265\n00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.639\nI've got automatic updates, so\nthe odds are I'm up to date.\n\n266\n00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:23.044\nBut if this is turned off,\nI can hit check now, and\n\n267\n00:13:23.044 --> 00:13:27.100\nthat will force it to check and\nlook for the updates.\n\n268\n00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.750\nNow it wasn't always like this.\n\n269\n00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:33.370\nIf you were running 10.8,\n10.8 I believe was the first\n\n270\n00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.680\nversion to get the App Store, and the\nupdates weren't rolled into it yet, right?\n\n271\n00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.938\nThey start that though a few\nversions later, and so\n\n272\n00:13:38.938 --> 00:13:40.629\nnow it's all wrapped up in one place.\n\n273\n00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:43.290\nIf you're running a newer\nversion of macOS, this is it.\n\n274\n00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.507\nIt's easy, right?\n\n275\n00:13:44.507 --> 00:13:46.724\nIf you're running an older version though,\n\n276\n00:13:46.724 --> 00:13:50.280\nunder your Apple menu you might\nsee an option that I don't see.\n\n277\n00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.520\nYou might see an option in here\nthat says System Updates, right?\n\n278\n00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.490\nIn fact,\nif I was running 10.8 I would see it here.\n\n279\n00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.720\nI would see a System Updates option.\n\n280\n00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.020\nYou'd click it and it would go and\nit would do the updates.\n\n281\n00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.750\nIt's actually the same updates.\n\n282\n00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.080\nThey just moved where it was located.\n\n283\n00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.190\nThey said, let's roll this into the App\nStore cuz Apple has this vision of,\n\n284\n00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:11.310\none day, everything will be in\nthat App Store, and that's it.\n\n285\n00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.110\nAnd we haven't reached that,\nnot even here in High Sierra.\n\n286\n00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.850\nSo you can still install\napplications however you want.\n\n287\n00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.980\nBut they did shift the updates over here.\n\n288\n00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.510\nSo for most of us,\nthe App Store is doing this.\n\n289\n00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:26.470\nIn fact, if I launch my App Store and\nI fire that up, it\n\n290\n00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.060\nloads the home page where it's advertising\nall this different software to me.\n\n291\n00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.080\nBut in the background, just launching\nthe App Store makes it check in.\n\n292\n00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:34.930\nAnd when it does that,\n\n293\n00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.890\na lot of times you'll see this button\nup here where it says Updates.\n\n294\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.990\nYou'll see a number one or\na number two appear on it or\n\n295\n00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.290\nsome number to tell you how\nmany updates are outstanding.\n\n296\n00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.580\nAnd you can click on that.\n\n297\n00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.207\nAnd you'll see the updates\nthat are waiting.\n\n298\n00:14:46.207 --> 00:14:50.970\nSee how mines already taken some updates\nand those are just kind of laid out here.\n\n299\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:51.860\nThis 10.13.3 supplemental update.\n\n300\n00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.560\nIt downloaded that and got it.\n\n301\n00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.967\nSo just coming here's\nanother way to check, right?\n\n302\n00:14:55.967 --> 00:14:58.940\nThis will take care of most of\nthe updates on your system.\n\n303\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.868\nBut if you have a really old Mac,\n\n304\n00:15:00.868 --> 00:15:05.513\none that's just barely hitting the\ncompatibility line that we saw earlier,\n\n305\n00:15:05.513 --> 00:15:10.410\nthen there might be special firmware\nupdates that you need to get as well.\n\n306\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.360\nIf there's firmware updates, well for\n\n307\n00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.850\nthose, on newer Macs they get it here\nfrom the App Store, so that's easy.\n\n308\n00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.650\nOn older Macs you'll have to go and\nupdate them manually.\n\n309\n00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:20.370\nIt's a little bit\n\n310\n00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.430\nmore of an involved process.\n&gt;&gt; Well Don,\n\n311\n00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.890\ndon't leave us in the lurch man.\n\n312\n00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.140\nIf I had to do that, what would I\nhave to do to update my firmware?\n\n313\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.480\nIs that a really involved process,\nor there's a few clicks, and\n\n314\n00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.190\nyou might have to understand a few things.\n&gt;&gt; It's not that it's,\n\n315\n00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.530\nI guess it kind of is,\nthe word to use, it's annoying.\n\n316\n00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.375\nIt's a really annoying-\n&gt;&gt; Little chestnuts!\n\n317\n00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:45.580\n[LAUGH] I'm pressing the thing,\nman, I'm pressing it!\n\n318\n00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.640\nWhy is it not working?\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of a pain,\n\n319\n00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.670\nI'm not going to kid you guys on this one.\n\n320\n00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.123\nIf you go to Apple's website.\n\n321\n00:15:51.123 --> 00:15:52.969\nLet me pull it up here.\n\n322\n00:15:52.969 --> 00:15:59.775\nOn Apple's website you can go to\nsupport.apple.com/downloads, all right?\n\n323\n00:15:59.775 --> 00:16:01.338\nWhen you go to that website,\n\n324\n00:16:01.338 --> 00:16:04.931\nthat's gonna take you to Apple's\nkinda generic Download page.\n\n325\n00:16:04.931 --> 00:16:06.737\nAnd if you look at the downloads\nthat are available,\n\n326\n00:16:06.737 --> 00:16:08.267\nit's showing you a bunch of stuff, right?\n\n327\n00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:11.870\nSo I'll see High Sierra updates and\niTunes and so on.\n\n328\n00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.730\nBut there's hardware updates hidden\naway inside of this as well.\n\n329\n00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.460\nAnd so when you look across this top\nproduct bar here, I see Mac Notebooks,\n\n330\n00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.150\nMac Desktops, right?\n\n331\n00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.390\nSo for example on my desktop,\nI have a Mac Mini that is a,\n\n332\n00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:28.290\nI think it's an earlier mid-2014 model.\n\n333\n00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.810\nSo it's a couple of years old.\n\n334\n00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.220\nWell, there's probably\nbeen firmware updates.\n\n335\n00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.460\nIt's newer, or a newish device.\n\n336\n00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.420\nSo it'll do the firmware updates\nautomatically, as part of the app store.\n\n337\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.190\nBut let's pretend it was even older.\n\n338\n00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.910\nWell, I would come in here, and\nI would say, all right, well,\n\n339\n00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.554\nI've got a Mac desktop.\n\n340\n00:16:42.554 --> 00:16:46.030\nLet me get back over here, there we go.\n\n341\n00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.410\nI've got a Mac desktop, and\nthen it will show me some of the desktops.\n\n342\n00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.820\nAnd I can say, all right,\nwell, here's a Mac Mini.\n\n343\n00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.913\nAll right, and I can see there's\na Mac Mini EFI Firmware Update,\n\n344\n00:16:53.913 --> 00:16:57.048\nVersion 1.8, and it's dated July 2015.\n\n345\n00:16:57.048 --> 00:17:01.639\nIf I bought the device after 2015,\nwhich I'm pretty sure I did,\n\n346\n00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:04.820\nit's likely already got this update,\nright?\n\n347\n00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:09.400\nBut if I bought it before July 15, 2015,\neither it automatically got the update\n\n348\n00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.560\nthrough the app store or\nI've got to download it myself, all right?\n\n349\n00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.230\nSo if I have to download it myself,\nI can download it right here and\n\n350\n00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.040\nI can install it.\n\n351\n00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.560\nThat's not so bad.\n\n352\n00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:23.440\nThe problem is, there's more\nupdates than just that, right?\n\n353\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.170\nAs I scroll down,\nI'll probably find Mac Minis again.\n\n354\n00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.700\nWell, I got to load more results.\n\n355\n00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.200\nAnd then, there's another one.\n\n356\n00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.920\nWell, all right,\nthat one's EFI firmware update 1.7.\n\n357\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.700\nIf I do 1.8, I don't need that.\n\n358\n00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.750\nBut if I keep looking,\nI may find even more things.\n\n359\n00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.000\nThese are EFI updates,\nright, firmware updates.\n\n360\n00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.340\nBut there might be updates that are\nrelated to some of the other hardware in\n\n361\n00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.410\nmy system.\n\n362\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.912\nSee how like this iMac,\nshows a iMac EFI update 1.6, and\n\n363\n00:17:49.912 --> 00:17:56.270\nthen there's an iMac graphic firmware\nupdate 2.0, two different updates.\n\n364\n00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.330\nWe would need to do both.\n\n365\n00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.930\nIt's hard to keep track of which ones\nwe need, and which ones we don't.\n\n366\n00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.530\nThe other thing is sometimes they're\nvery specific on their model.\n\n367\n00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.010\nSo I might see this one here,\nthat's a Macbook Pro.\n\n368\n00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:09.980\nSo I might think, I might need that.\n\n369\n00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.520\nBut then when you click on it and\n\n370\n00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.170\ngo to read the details, you find out\nthat it's for one specific model.\n\n371\n00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.230\nAnd it'll usually tell you\nin here exactly which model.\n\n372\n00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.542\nSo if you go into\nthe System Requirements of it, actually,\n\n373\n00:18:21.542 --> 00:18:23.422\nthis one is a bad example.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n374\n00:18:23.422 --> 00:18:24.961\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't mention the specific model, but\n\n375\n00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:26.080\nsometimes they will.\n\n376\n00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.950\nSo the pain here is just figuring out\n\n377\n00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:28.570\nwhich ones you need.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n378\n00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:29.540\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n379\n00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.890\nAnd getting that sorted out.\n\n380\n00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.260\nBut once you get that figured out,\nthen the installation is pretty easy.\n\n381\n00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.060\nSo it's just kind of annoying.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n382\n00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.830\nWell, Don, now that we know what\nwe have to do to prepare to\n\n383\n00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.410\nupgrade to High Sierra.\n\n384\n00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.410\nHow do we actually get High Sierra so\n\n385\n00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:43.790\nthat we can update?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n386\n00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.780\nso there's a couple of ways\nto install High Sierra.\n\n387\n00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.350\nThe way that Apple intends you to do it,\nif you're running Mac OS 10.8 or\n\n388\n00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:55.548\nnewer and you've done your updates,\nyou should just be able to update\n\n389\n00:18:55.548 --> 00:18:58.496\nthe High Sierra through your App Store.\n&gt;&gt; I thought they were gonna say just go\n\n390\n00:18:58.496 --> 00:19:01.183\nto Best Buy and buy a brand new Mac,\nand there you go, it's updated.\n\n391\n00:19:01.183 --> 00:19:03.818\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is an upgrade.\n\n392\n00:19:03.818 --> 00:19:04.954\n&gt;&gt; Just sell your old one on Ebay,\n\n393\n00:19:04.954 --> 00:19:05.833\nnow you're good to go.\n\n394\n00:19:05.833 --> 00:19:06.780\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Although,\n\n395\n00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.840\nthey'd probably scratch the Best Buy\npart and say but from Apple store.\n\n396\n00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Apple store, so, sorry.\n\n397\n00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.084\n&gt;&gt; But either way,\n\n398\n00:19:13.084 --> 00:19:14.705\nthat is one way to upgrade.\n\n399\n00:19:14.705 --> 00:19:19.644\nAnd if you're exceedingly wealthy then\nyeah, absolutely create it that way.\n\n400\n00:19:19.644 --> 00:19:21.500\nThat's the easiest and\nyou get a new computer.\n\n401\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.406\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n402\n00:19:22.406 --> 00:19:24.032\n&gt;&gt; But the rest of us we might need to\n\n403\n00:19:24.032 --> 00:19:26.455\ndeal with our own hardware and\nget it upgraded.\n\n404\n00:19:26.455 --> 00:19:28.882\nAnd the App Store usually makes that easy,\nokay?\n\n405\n00:19:28.882 --> 00:19:32.145\nSo let me show you how I would do this\nif I was just a regular person doing\n\n406\n00:19:32.145 --> 00:19:33.170\nan upgrade, right?\n\n407\n00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.660\nI would fire up my App Store.\n\n408\n00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.190\nAnd the App Store might even suggest\nit to me, but if it doesn't,\n\n409\n00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.140\nI would just come in and\ndo a quick search.\n\n410\n00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.060\nI would say, you know what,\nlet me just search for High Sierra.\n\n411\n00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.100\nAnd when I search for\nHigh Sierra, I'll find it and\n\n412\n00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.040\nif you click on it,\nit will be a free download, right?\n\n413\n00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.500\nIt'll normally say download right there.\n\n414\n00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.380\nI've already downloaded it, so\n\n415\n00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.170\nmine says open, but you'll hit download,\nit'll download oddly enough, and\n\n416\n00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:01.960\nwhen it's done it runs the installer,\nand it upgrades your Mac.\n\n417\n00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.950\nAnd it upgrades it and gets it up and\ngoing, and all of your software stays all\n\n418\n00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.620\nof your documents stay, your settings gets\ntransitioned over, and it reboots and\n\n419\n00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.720\nall of a sudden,\nyou're running High Sierra.\n\n420\n00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.103\nPretty easy upgrade, all right.\n\n421\n00:20:12.103 --> 00:20:14.881\nThe file that it downloads is\na little over five gigs in size,\n\n422\n00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:18.473\nI think it's like five and a half gigs and\nthat's partly why we need the 14 and\n\n423\n00:20:18.473 --> 00:20:21.210\na half gigs of hard drive space\navailable to do the upgrade.\n\n424\n00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:24.240\nBecause you gotta download that file,\nand then it's gotta extract it and\n\n425\n00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.640\noverride the older files.\n\n426\n00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.190\nBut that's basically it for\nmost of us, for\n\n427\n00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.800\nmost of us that are gonna do the upgrade,\nthat's it, right?\n\n428\n00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.870\nBut what if I wanna upgrade a Mac\nthat's not connected to the internet?\n\n429\n00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.720\nThat doesn't work, right?\n\n430\n00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.430\nOr what if I don't want to do an upgrade?\n\n431\n00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.100\nWhat if I want to do a clean install?\n\n432\n00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.240\nMaybe I've been using my Mac for\na few years.\n\n433\n00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.830\nIt's got some stuff on there and maybe\nit is running a little slower and I say,\n\n434\n00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.054\nI just want a clean slate.\n\n435\n00:20:51.054 --> 00:20:54.160\nI want to wipe the hard drive and\ninstall clean, okay.\n\n436\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.370\nThe App store can't do that,\nit can't do that for you.\n\n437\n00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:01.600\nSo in those cases we have to\ndo a manual upgrade, right?\n\n438\n00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.130\nWell, clicking the download button here,\nthat's not very exciting, so\n\n439\n00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.980\nanybody can do that, you just\nclick the button and there you go.\n\n440\n00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:12.110\nSo I wanna show you guys how to get\nready for doing a manual install, right,\n\n441\n00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.280\nor a clean install, If I want to do that.\n\n442\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.930\nAnd there's two reasons I wanna\nshow this to you, all right?\n\n443\n00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.830\nOne reason is,\nwell you might fit that scenario.\n\n444\n00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.950\nYou need to do a offline install,\nor you wanna do a clean install.\n\n445\n00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.640\nThe other option is,\nor the other reason is,\n\n446\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.490\nin order to do an offline install,\nwe have to create installation media.\n\n447\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:35.875\nYou have to create an installation device,\nlike a USB key, that can install Mac OS\n\n448\n00:21:35.875 --> 00:21:41.715\nand that USB key is incredibly handy for\nthings other than installing Mac OS.\n\n449\n00:21:41.715 --> 00:21:45.055\nWe can use it to recover our\nMac if it ever gets damaged.\n\n450\n00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:48.355\nWe can use it to trouble shoot and\ndiagnose a Mac.\n\n451\n00:21:48.355 --> 00:21:50.985\nYou can use it for all sorts of things.\n\n452\n00:21:50.985 --> 00:21:54.525\nSo if you're going to be\nan Apple Support Professional,\n\n453\n00:21:54.525 --> 00:21:57.060\na Certified Support Professional.\n\n454\n00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.340\nYou're supporting Macs.\n\n455\n00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.710\nThis little key that we're gonna make,\nthat thing is incredibly handy,\n\n456\n00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.420\nit's one of the tools of your toolbox.\n\n457\n00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:07.640\nIn fact throughout the whole rest of this\nseries, I'm going to assume that you've\n\n458\n00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:14.370\ngot a USB key laying around with Mac OS\non it, ready to use to recover your Macs.\n\n459\n00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.580\nAnd it's free, right?\n\n460\n00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.930\nI mean the cost is the USB key which\nyou can get for 15 bucks on Amazon.\n\n461\n00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:22.730\nThey don't cost much.\n\n462\n00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.769\nBut there's probably a special\nApple one that does cost a lot but-\n\n463\n00:22:25.769 --> 00:22:26.415\n&gt;&gt; It's $800.\n\n464\n00:22:26.415 --> 00:22:28.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's just a USB key that we put\n\n465\n00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:33.000\nthe installer on and we can use it for\nso many different things.\n\n466\n00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.810\nSo if you're working in\nan environment where you support Macs,\n\n467\n00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:38.180\nit's a good idea to make one of these and\nto have it.\n\n468\n00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.590\nAnd to update them as new\nversions of Mac OS come about.\n\n469\n00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.424\nSo creating this key is important, and I\nwant to show you guys how to create that,\n\n470\n00:22:44.424 --> 00:22:46.475\nand we've got some time.\n&gt;&gt; We've got just enough time,\n\n471\n00:22:46.475 --> 00:22:49.150\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; So in order to make one of these,\n\n472\n00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.300\nfirst we've got to get a copy\nof the Mac OS Installer, right?\n\n473\n00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.750\nWell, if we go back to the App Store,\nwhen you click Download on High Sierra,\n\n474\n00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.980\nit's gonna download it and\nthen it's gonna try and install it.\n\n475\n00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.860\nWell on my Mac,\nI'm already running High Sierra, and\n\n476\n00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.530\nit let me download it, that's cool.\n\n477\n00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.570\nAnd when I went to install it,\n\n478\n00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.730\nI just closed the installer,\nright because I don't need to install it.\n\n479\n00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:12.240\nI've already got it, right?\n\n480\n00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.880\nBut the nice part about this is that,\neven though I cancelled the installer,\n\n481\n00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.950\nit downloaded the installation file.\n\n482\n00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:23.023\nIf I where to go into my finder, and\n\n483\n00:23:23.023 --> 00:23:28.050\ngoing to my applications folder.\n\n484\n00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:31.520\nInside of my applications folder,\nif I poke around in here,\n\n485\n00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:36.250\nI should be able to find Install Mac OS,\nHigh Sierra, right?\n\n486\n00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.670\nThere it is,\nthat's the installation file for\n\n487\n00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.520\nthe entire Mac OS High Sierra installer.\n\n488\n00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.350\nIf I do a control click and\n\n489\n00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.700\nchoose get info or you can do\na command i to get the information.\n\n490\n00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:54.658\nAnd I take a look at it, I can see\nthat that file is 5.2 gigs in size.\n\n491\n00:23:54.658 --> 00:23:57.654\nI was off, I said five and a half\ngigs earlier so a little bit smaller.\n\n492\n00:23:57.654 --> 00:23:59.366\n5.2 gigs in size.\n\n493\n00:23:59.366 --> 00:24:00.772\nThe reason I highlight this.\n\n494\n00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:04.184\nIs if the download gets interrupted,\nyou might end up with a one gig file,\n\n495\n00:24:04.184 --> 00:24:07.760\nand that's a damaged file, and\nthat would cause some problems later.\n\n496\n00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.110\nBut the full one should be\na little over five gigs in size.\n\n497\n00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:13.970\nI've got it, it's sitting right there,\nand those are the installation files.\n\n498\n00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:19.175\nAll I've gotta do is get\nthose on the USB key somehow.\n\n499\n00:24:19.175 --> 00:24:22.480\nAll right, but I can't just drag and\ndrop that file on here.\n\n500\n00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:27.083\nThat's not gonna work, because we need to\nbe able to boot off of this USB key, so\n\n501\n00:24:27.083 --> 00:24:28.750\nwe need to make it bootable.\n\n502\n00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:33.230\nAll right, and for that, Apple gives\nus a command line script that we use.\n\n503\n00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.750\nIt's not the easiest script in the world\nto type, the command is really long.\n\n504\n00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:43.260\nBut once you run it, it will turn this\ngeneric USB key into installation media.\n\n505\n00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.920\nNow, before I get started on that,\n\n506\n00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.980\nlet's talk about another slight\nproblem you might run into, my Mac.\n\n507\n00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:55.060\nMy Mac is a newer Macbook,\nand on the newer Macbooks,\n\n508\n00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:59.010\nthey only give you one kind of port,\nUSB-C ports.\n\n509\n00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:03.210\nAll right, I keep holding up this USB key\nand waving it around like this is what\n\n510\n00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.020\neverybody's gonna use because, well-\n&gt;&gt; It's what they're\n\n511\n00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:06.552\ngonna use.\n&gt;&gt; It is what they're gonna use.\n\n512\n00:25:06.552 --> 00:25:07.226\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n513\n00:25:07.226 --> 00:25:09.568\n&gt;&gt; But it's got the older style USB\n\n514\n00:25:09.568 --> 00:25:15.119\nconnector, right, the squared-off\nconnector that has a right side up and\n\n515\n00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:20.370\nan upside down way of putting it in,\nand these are pretty commonplace.\n\n516\n00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:21.840\nBut on the newer Macbook Pros,\n\n517\n00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.500\nyou've only got USB-C ports,\nthis won't plug in, right.\n\n518\n00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.998\nOn every other Mac, it will,\nMac Mini,, an iMac, a Mac Pro,\n\n519\n00:25:28.998 --> 00:25:32.248\nI think really just the Macbook Airs and\nthe Macbook Pros.\n\n520\n00:25:32.248 --> 00:25:36.915\nActually, the Macbook Airs still have full\nsize ports on them because they haven't\n\n521\n00:25:36.915 --> 00:25:38.530\nrefreshed them.\n\n522\n00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:39.710\nBy the time you watch this episode,\n\n523\n00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:41.810\nI'll bet they've refreshed\nthose MacBook Airs, though.\n\n524\n00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:45.690\nAnd over the next year or two,\nthey'll update the other ones and\n\n525\n00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.490\nstart going USB-C,\njust part of their evolution.\n\n526\n00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:54.120\nSo in addition to having a USB key, you\nmight need to spend a little bit more and\n\n527\n00:25:54.120 --> 00:26:01.270\nget one of these guys that converts\nthe older style USB connector Into USB-C.\n\n528\n00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:05.830\nSo I have to do that because of my laptop,\nso I'm gonna plug this thing in.\n\n529\n00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:10.623\nThese are not outrageously expensive,\nthe official Apple ones are $20.\n\n530\n00:26:10.623 --> 00:26:12.110\n&gt;&gt; That's not bad.\n\n531\n00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.994\n&gt;&gt; You can get third party ones for\n\n532\n00:26:13.994 --> 00:26:17.920\n50 cents, they all work the same,\nso spend money if you want.\n\n533\n00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.624\nBut I've got this one,\nI don't remember how I got this one, but\n\n534\n00:26:21.624 --> 00:26:23.900\nI probably just paid 20 bucks for it.\n\n535\n00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:29.040\nSo anyhow, I'm gonna use this,\njust another tool in your toolbox, right?\n\n536\n00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.500\nSo two pieces of hardware here,\n\n537\n00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:34.690\nI think I'm probably holding a combined\n$35 worth of equipment in my hand.\n\n538\n00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:38.270\nSo that's not bad as far as IT tools go.\n&gt;&gt; And you get to reuse that adapter for\n\n539\n00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:40.330\nyour other USB devices as well.\n\n540\n00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:46.720\nYeah, because lord only knows, I have\none USB-C device, all these other ones.\n\n541\n00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.330\nSo yeah, these are pretty commonplace,\nall right, so once I've got this ready,,\n\n542\n00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.090\nthe first thing I need to do\nis format the USB key, right.\n\n543\n00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.790\nI don't actually have to format it, but if\nthere's more than one partition on there,\n\n544\n00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.160\nthat can cause some problems.\n\n545\n00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.290\nAnd I also need to basically be aware\nthat I'm gonna get rid of any data\n\n546\n00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.140\nthat's on here, so it needs to be gone.\n\n547\n00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.810\nSo a good idea is to just\nformat it as Mac OS extended,\n\n548\n00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:08.370\nget that file system done on there.\n\n549\n00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:09.390\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n550\n00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.510\nplug this USB key in,\nI actually don't remember what's on there.\n\n551\n00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.280\nThere might even be the High Sierra\ninstaller on it already.\n\n552\n00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.197\nBut I'm gonna plug it in, and\nthen I'm gonna get into my disk utility.\n\n553\n00:27:20.197 --> 00:27:25.165\nRight, and inside of the disk utility,\nwe can see that USB drive,\n\n554\n00:27:25.165 --> 00:27:29.370\nso I can see it right\nhere as my external disk.\n\n555\n00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:33.060\nAnd it is already formatted,\nlooks like it's already empty, but\n\n556\n00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.928\nI'm just gonna erase it again\njust to be on the safe side.\n\n557\n00:27:34.928 --> 00:27:38.046\nSo I'm gonna hit Erase,\nif there's more than one partition on it,\n\n558\n00:27:38.046 --> 00:27:41.712\nthere shouldn't be, but if there are,\nyou wanna get rid of those partitions,\n\n559\n00:27:41.712 --> 00:27:43.100\njust have one big partition.\n\n560\n00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.517\nAnd in fact, on a lot of these,\nit will just call them untitled, so\n\n561\n00:27:46.517 --> 00:27:50.260\nI'll call mine untitled,\nif you'd like to leave that blank.\n\n562\n00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.260\nI usually call mine something like\nUSB Drive so I can remember what it is.\n\n563\n00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.140\nBut I'll just set that and\nI'll erase it real quick.\n\n564\n00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.560\nAll right, once that's erased,\nthere it goes,\n\n565\n00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.330\nnow I'm ready to turn that\ninto an actual installer.\n\n566\n00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:08.700\nSo right now, it's nothing special,\nit's a blank USB drive, right, But\n\n567\n00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.460\nI need it to be more than that, I need it\nto be something that I can boot off of.\n\n568\n00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.195\nSo I'm gonna get into my terminal, and\n\n569\n00:28:15.195 --> 00:28:20.240\nthe terminal,\na lot of us may not use it very much,\n\n570\n00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.380\nright, because the graphical user\ninterface has most of what we want.\n\n571\n00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.820\nBut if you've never\nbeen into the terminal,\n\n572\n00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:30.360\nI almost always use Spotlight to launch\nthese things, so I do a Cmd+Spacebar, and\n\n573\n00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.480\nthen I just type what I want,\nI want terminal.\n\n574\n00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.804\nBut if you're an all GUI person,\n\n575\n00:28:34.804 --> 00:28:39.867\nif you browse into your Applications\nfolder, inside of Applications,\n\n576\n00:28:39.867 --> 00:28:43.316\nyou'll find a folder called Utilities.\n&gt;&gt; You just passed it,\n\n577\n00:28:43.316 --> 00:28:43.915\nit's that way.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n578\n00:28:43.915 --> 00:28:44.731\nit's in the Us.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n579\n00:28:44.731 --> 00:28:45.711\n&gt;&gt; If I can master the whole alphabet\n\n580\n00:28:45.711 --> 00:28:46.964\nthing.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n581\n00:28:46.964 --> 00:28:48.587\n&gt;&gt; And inside of Utilities,\n\n582\n00:28:48.587 --> 00:28:52.920\nyou'll find a bunch of stuff,\nincluding the terminal, right?\n\n583\n00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.480\nSo that's what I'm launching here,\nterminal.\n\n584\n00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.021\nDisk utility is in here as well,\nif you have never run that before,\n\n585\n00:28:58.021 --> 00:28:59.680\nyou should have by this point.\n\n586\n00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.624\nBut when you go to the terminal,\n\n587\n00:29:02.624 --> 00:29:07.660\nThat's when you get the very\nun-Apple command line.\n\n588\n00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.850\nAnd mine's a little bigger than\non most systems by default.\n\n589\n00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.040\nThe default is actually a super\nsmall font that's hard to read.\n\n590\n00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.172\n&gt;&gt; Super tiny.\n\n591\n00:29:14.172 --> 00:29:15.889\n&gt;&gt; Even with mine being larger,\n\n592\n00:29:15.889 --> 00:29:17.085\nit's still small.\n\n593\n00:29:17.085 --> 00:29:22.950\nSo you can use Cmd+Plus, if you hold Cmd\nand just tap Plus over and over again,\n\n594\n00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:27.940\nit'll make that window bigger until you\ncan actually read what it says, right.\n\n595\n00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.980\nAnd the default is that it's\nblack text on a white background;\n\n596\n00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.550\nI've kind of changed mine a little bit.\n\n597\n00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:36.290\nBut but just do Cmd+Plus just to make\nit big enough to be able to read.\n\n598\n00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:39.765\nAnd once you can read it,\nthen we're ready to get in and\n\n599\n00:29:39.765 --> 00:29:41.685\nmake that installation, right?\n\n600\n00:29:41.685 --> 00:29:43.655\nNow, my installation drive or\n\n601\n00:29:43.655 --> 00:29:47.145\nmy USB key that I'm gonna\noverwrite here is called untitled.\n\n602\n00:29:47.145 --> 00:29:50.695\nWe need to know the name of that disk,\nand so mine, I can see right there,\n\n603\n00:29:50.695 --> 00:29:51.739\nit's called untitled.\n\n604\n00:29:51.739 --> 00:29:55.805\nIf I left it called USB drive,\nI just need to remember what that name is.\n\n605\n00:29:55.805 --> 00:29:59.250\nAnd then we're gonna call this\nscript that Apple's provided us.\n\n606\n00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:03.400\nThe script is inside of\nthe High Sierra installer, so\n\n607\n00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.710\nwhen I go to run it, I've gotta be able to\npoint to the script inside the installer.\n\n608\n00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.000\nYou do need to be\nan administrator to run this, and\n\n609\n00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000\nfrom the command line, normally when you\nrun a command, it's being run as you.\n\n610\n00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.040\nIf I run a command like whoami,\nthat's gonna run as me, dpezet, right?\n\n611\n00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.830\nBut I need to run something\nas an administrator.\n\n612\n00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:25.250\nAnd to do that, we have the super\nuser do command, or sudo.\n\n613\n00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:29.950\nI want to sudo whoamI, and when I do that,\n\n614\n00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.280\nit's gonna ask for a password, cuz it's\ngoing to run it as an administrator.\n\n615\n00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.172\nAnd when I provide it my password,\nit's going to run, and\n\n616\n00:30:37.172 --> 00:30:39.086\nyou see who it shows I am now?\n\n617\n00:30:39.086 --> 00:30:40.767\nI'm not dpezet, I'm root,\n\n618\n00:30:40.767 --> 00:30:45.320\nI'm running it as an administrator, right?\n&gt;&gt; So Don, obviously, you would need\n\n619\n00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:50.010\nan account that has the ability to up\nlevel to an administrator's account.\n\n620\n00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.880\nNot any old standard account's\ngonna allow you to do that, right?\n\n621\n00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.333\n&gt;&gt; You need to be an administrator because\n\n622\n00:30:53.333 --> 00:30:55.410\nyou're effectively gonna\nblow away this thumb drive.\n\n623\n00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.513\nYou're gonna delete anything\nthat's on there, so\n\n624\n00:30:57.513 --> 00:30:59.630\nthey make you be an administrator for\nthat, right?\n\n625\n00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.517\nSo I'm gonna say sudo, and\n\n626\n00:31:01.517 --> 00:31:07.360\nthen I'm gonna point to the script that's\ninside of that High Sierra updater.\n\n627\n00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.640\nSo I'm gonna point to /Applications/ and\n\n628\n00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.600\njust on a side note here,\nthis is case sensitive.\n\n629\n00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.380\nSo the Applications folder has\na capital A, I've gotta do a capital A.\n\n630\n00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.310\nAs you're typing, there's one trick\nI use to make sure I type it right.\n\n631\n00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.590\nIs the command line has what's\ncalled tab autocomplete.\n\n632\n00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.530\nYou can type the first few letters and\n\n633\n00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.530\nthen when you hit Tab,\nit'll type out the rest.\n\n634\n00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:34.220\nIf it doesn't type out the rest, then you\neither haven't typed enough letters, or\n\n635\n00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.000\nyou've got a mistake, right.\n\n636\n00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.530\nSo if I just type A-P-P-L-I-C and\nI hit Tab, It fills it out, right?\n\n637\n00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:48.340\nBut let's do A-P-P-L-I-C, and\nI'm gonna change that A to a lowercase a,\n\n638\n00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.390\nand I hit Tab, nothing happens, right?\n\n639\n00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:54.912\nThat's my clue that I either haven't typed\nenough letters, or I typed it wrong.\n\n640\n00:31:54.912 --> 00:32:00.265\nSo that tab autocomplete is really handy,\nso it just helps you to spot errors.\n\n641\n00:32:00.265 --> 00:32:04.274\nIt's also really helpful though when\nyou've got a file like the Mac Installer\n\n642\n00:32:04.274 --> 00:32:05.740\nthat has spaces in the name.\n\n643\n00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:09.330\nCuz whenever there's a space you have\nto do a back slash before the space.\n\n644\n00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:13.030\nSo if I just type Inst and\nhit Tab, it does install\n\n645\n00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:18.320\nMacOS High Sierra.app and\nit does the escaping for each space.\n\n646\n00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.886\nThat back slash before each space is\ncalled an escape to make sure that\n\n647\n00:32:21.886 --> 00:32:23.240\nthe command is complete.\n\n648\n00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.830\nNow that's the actual upgrader,\nI need to point to a script inside of it.\n\n649\n00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:33.800\nAnd inside of there it's in the contents\nfolder, and then the resources folder.\n\n650\n00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.305\nAnd then the actual script is\ncalled create install media, and\n\n651\n00:32:38.305 --> 00:32:41.195\nit's gonna screen wrap on me a bit here.\n\n652\n00:32:41.195 --> 00:32:45.435\nBut create install media,\nthat's where that installer script is.\n\n653\n00:32:45.435 --> 00:32:48.688\nNow I can't just run that,\ncuz it doesn't have a GUI.\n\n654\n00:32:48.688 --> 00:32:50.625\nAll right, it's not gonna pop up\na window and let me do things.\n\n655\n00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:52.575\nIt does it entirely from the command line.\n\n656\n00:32:52.575 --> 00:32:55.468\nSo I need to tell it where\nthe installation files are,\n\n657\n00:32:55.468 --> 00:32:58.280\nand I need to tell it\nwhere my thumb drive is.\n\n658\n00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.120\nSo the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna tell it which thumb drive I'm\n\n659\n00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.710\nusing so I'm gonna say --volume and\n\n660\n00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:11.030\nI'll point to /volumes, /, and\nwhatever the name of the drive is.\n\n661\n00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:14.020\nMine is called untitled, right?\n\n662\n00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.940\nAnd it puts a backslash in there,\nyou can leave it or you can take it out,\n\n663\n00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.180\nit doesn't need that, I'm sorry\na forward slash there at the end.\n\n664\n00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.609\nBut the name of the disk is what's really\nimportant, mine's called untitled.\n\n665\n00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:28.495\nThen we need to tell it, where the\ninstaller is, you'd think it would know,\n\n666\n00:33:28.495 --> 00:33:30.668\ncause the script is in there but\nit doesn't.\n\n667\n00:33:30.668 --> 00:33:32.007\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n668\n00:33:32.007 --> 00:33:34.682\n&gt;&gt; So then I'm gonna come in and point to,\n\n669\n00:33:34.682 --> 00:33:40.037\nI'll say, --applicationpath, and\nthen I'll point it to the installer,\n\n670\n00:33:40.037 --> 00:33:43.542\nwhich is identical to\nthe beginning of my command.\n\n671\n00:33:43.542 --> 00:33:46.482\nI can actually copy and\npaste that if I wanted, but\n\n672\n00:33:46.482 --> 00:33:50.123\nwith tab autocomplete it's\nactually fast enough that I can do\n\n673\n00:33:50.123 --> 00:33:53.706\n/Applications/Install\\ macOS\\\nHigh \\Sierra.app.\n\n674\n00:33:53.706 --> 00:33:56.610\nAnd I can point to that, and I also don't\nneed the trailing slash on that one,\n\n675\n00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:57.740\nI can get rid of that, right?\n\n676\n00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:00.190\nIt's a long command.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n677\n00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:00.830\nit is.\n\n678\n00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:01.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Very specific.\n\n679\n00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.440\n&gt;&gt; But it boils down to three things.\n\n680\n00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.010\nI point to the script.\n\n681\n00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.323\nI tell it where the USB\ndrive is I'm formatting, and\n\n682\n00:34:08.323 --> 00:34:12.706\nthen I tell it where the installer\nis that I'm putting on the USB key.\n\n683\n00:34:12.706 --> 00:34:15.150\nThose three things,\njust ends up being really long.\n\n684\n00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.770\nI'll put this command in the show notes so\n\n685\n00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:19.310\nyou guys have it,\ndon't feel like you have to write it down.\n\n686\n00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:20.115\nBut that's it,\n\n687\n00:34:20.115 --> 00:34:23.804\nit's been the same command for a long\ntime from previous versions of Mac OS.\n\n688\n00:34:23.804 --> 00:34:25.988\nThe only thing that really changes\nis the name of the installer,\n\n689\n00:34:25.988 --> 00:34:27.450\nthe rest of it is pretty straightforward.\n\n690\n00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:31.380\nAnd when I run that,\nit's gonna warn me that it's gonna remove\n\n691\n00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.920\neverything on that USB key,\nwhich I'm okay with.\n\n692\n00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.460\nI'll hit Y, and now it's gonna\ngo through and erase that disk.\n\n693\n00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:42.820\nSo it's erasing it, and\nnow it's gonna copy the installer over.\n\n694\n00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:44.530\nNow, quick word of warning.\n\n695\n00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:48.110\nIf you're on a newer Mac,\nyou probably have USB 3.0.\n\n696\n00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.990\nAnd if your thumb drive is USB 3.0,\nthis will happen pretty quick.\n\n697\n00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:52.835\nIt might only take two minutes.\n\n698\n00:34:52.835 --> 00:34:57.783\nBut if you have a USB 2.0 thumb drive, or\nyou're on an older Mac that only has USB\n\n699\n00:34:57.783 --> 00:35:01.674\n2 ports, this can actually\ntake 20 minutes, 30 minutes.\n\n700\n00:35:01.674 --> 00:35:02.730\nIt can take a while.\n\n701\n00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:06.470\nSo you may need to just start it,\ngo take a break, get a cup of coffee,\n\n702\n00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:07.170\ncome back later.\n\n703\n00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.360\nAnd that installation disk will be made.\n\n704\n00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.578\nYou'll know it's done because it'll\nhave another, see this 0 to 100%?\n\n705\n00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:16.384\nThere will be another one that comes up\nand it'll actually let you know that it's\n\n706\n00:35:16.384 --> 00:35:18.960\n100% completed and\nit's been written to media, all right?\n\n707\n00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.670\nSo we'll know that when it's done.\n\n708\n00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.910\nBut right now we kinda go\ninto the waiting game.\n\n709\n00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:23.760\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Don,\n\n710\n00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.190\nI know that this game is actually\ngoing to wait for quite some time.\n\n711\n00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:30.600\nSo I say this is a great place for\nus to call it a day.\n\n712\n00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.360\nPlus we're out of time for this episode.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n713\n00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.010\n&gt;&gt; So that's another mitigating factor\n\n714\n00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.650\nwhen it comes to whether or not we're\ngonna close our show, which we are.\n\n715\n00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.090\nBut we do thank you for dropping by, Don.\n\n716\n00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:40.570\nLooking forward to seeing\nus take this High Sierra,\n\n717\n00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:44.650\nget it actually installed, and move on\nfrom there with the rest of our series.\n\n718\n00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:45.960\nBut really good stuff so far.\n\n719\n00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.260\nLearned two interesting things.\n\n720\n00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:50.530\nA, one of the most important things\nthat you would need to know as an ACSP,\n\n721\n00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:53.010\nis has no GUI driven thing at all.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n722\n00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:54.780\n&gt;&gt; And we're talking Apple here.\n\n723\n00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.636\nAnd two, Safari 11 is not,\nit's the version,\n\n724\n00:35:57.636 --> 00:35:59.412\nit's not the amount of users.\n\n725\n00:35:59.412 --> 00:36:00.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I thought that was interesting.\n\n726\n00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.100\n&gt;&gt; They might be the same,\n\n727\n00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:01.640\nyou don't know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n728\n00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you got me there.\n\n729\n00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.040\nGot anything else you want to add,\n\n730\n00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.310\nbefore we close?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n731\n00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:07.520\nwhat we saw in this\nepisode was all prep work.\n\n732\n00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.970\nTechnically you could skip a lot of this,\nif you already had it.\n\n733\n00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:12.910\nIn the next episode we're gonna\nactually do the installation.\n\n734\n00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:15.690\nAnd the installation's\nactually pretty much the same.\n\n735\n00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.240\nWhether you're doing an upgrade, or\n\n736\n00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.650\na clean install, all the methods kinda\nconverge into the same installation.\n\n737\n00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.540\nSo we'll pick that up on the next one.\n\n738\n00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.130\nI've been using my Macbook here\nwhich already has Hi Sierra on it.\n\n739\n00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:30.940\nOn the next episode, I'll switch to a Mac\nMini that's running regular Sierra so\n\n740\n00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:34.350\nwe can do the upgrade, or\nwipe it and start fresh.\n\n741\n00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:36.208\nSo I'll upgrade different hardware for\n\n742\n00:36:36.208 --> 00:36:38.401\nthat one as we walk through\nthat whole process.\n\n743\n00:36:38.401 --> 00:36:39.780\nDefinitely stay tuned for\nthat next episode.\n\n744\n00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.890\n&gt;&gt; All right, well thanks Don so much for\n\n745\n00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:43.670\njoining us, thank you good folks\nout there for watching, but\n\n746\n00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.390\nit does look like we are there.\n\n747\n00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:48.610\nEnd of this episode but stay tuned,\nwe have plenty in this series to come.\n\n748\n00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:51.380\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV I've\nbeen your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n749\n00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.110\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n750\n00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.498\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n751\n00:36:54.498 --> 00:37:00.454\n[MUSIC]\n\n752\n00:37:00.454 --> 00:37:03.681\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:11.634\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:16.947\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.947 --> 00:00:18.674\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n6\n00:00:18.674 --> 00:00:21.631\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our ACSP series,\n\n7\n00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:24.786\nthe Apple certified support\nprofessional for Mac OS High Sierra.\n\n8\n00:00:24.786 --> 00:00:26.017\nIt's been a lot of fun so far.\n\n9\n00:00:26.017 --> 00:00:30.075\nJoining us back in the studio,\nour good friend Mr Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:30.904\nDon, we're glad to have you again today.\n\n11\n00:00:30.904 --> 00:00:32.723\nHow's it going sir?\n&gt;&gt; It is going great, Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:36.830\nReady to continue our adventure in\nthe world of macOS High Sierra.\n\n13\n00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.791\nIf you've been watching all of the series,\n\n14\n00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:40.972\nwhich includes one whole\nepisode at this point.\n\n15\n00:00:40.972 --> 00:00:45.357\nThen what you would have seen is that we\nwere doing the things to get prepared to\n\n16\n00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:46.980\ninstall macOS High Sierra.\n\n17\n00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.852\nSo we talked about\nthe minimum requirements and\n\n18\n00:00:48.852 --> 00:00:50.877\nhow to build a USB key and\nall that other good stuff.\n\n19\n00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:52.590\nAnd then we kinda stopped and\nwe never actually installed it.\n\n20\n00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.790\nAnd so in this episode what we're\ngonna do is continue that, and\n\n21\n00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.060\nwe're actually going to install it.\n\n22\n00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.546\nNow if you know your hardware\nsupports macOS High Sierra,\n\n23\n00:01:00.546 --> 00:01:03.145\nthen you could skip your other episode and\nstart right here.\n\n24\n00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:08.100\nThe process for doing the install or\nan upgrade is really the same.\n\n25\n00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.559\nAnd so\nwe're gonna run through that process here.\n\n26\n00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:13.378\nWe'll show all the ins and outs of that as\nwe move through getting a system fresh,\n\n27\n00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:14.910\nclean, and installed.\n\n28\n00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.970\nAnd seeing what it's like to get up and\nrunning with High Sierra.\n\n29\n00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.118\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, it seems like,\n\n30\n00:01:18.118 --> 00:01:20.255\njust from an outside\nperspective looking in,\n\n31\n00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:23.840\nlike it would take a lot of technical\nacumen to be able to install High Sierra.\n\n32\n00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.464\nHow difficult is it for\nus to get this thing installed?\n\n33\n00:01:27.464 --> 00:01:28.988\n&gt;&gt; It can be very easy,\n\n34\n00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.790\nbut it can also be hard.\n\n35\n00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.003\nIt depends on what you're trying to do.\n\n36\n00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:34.534\nFor most people, well wait,\n\n37\n00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:36.765\nlet's talk about the easiest way.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n38\n00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:38.150\n&gt;&gt; The easiest way to install macOS\n\n39\n00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.045\nHigh Sierra is-\n&gt;&gt; Buy\n\n40\n00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:39.761\na new MacBook.\n\n41\n00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:40.876\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n42\n00:01:40.876 --> 00:01:42.950\n&gt;&gt; You took the training course.\n\n43\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.890\n&gt;&gt; I've been there,\n\n44\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.414\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n45\n00:01:44.414 --> 00:01:48.770\nmany people upgrade to a new OS\nsimply by buying new hardware.\n\n46\n00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.933\nNow, I say many people.\n\n47\n00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:53.384\nIn reality it's not many people.\n&gt;&gt; 0.02% of the population.\n\n48\n00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:55.854\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the business model for\n\n49\n00:01:55.854 --> 00:01:57.350\nApple though.\n\n50\n00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.560\nBuy a new hardware, you get a new OS.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n51\n00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.690\n&gt;&gt; But the reality is,\n\n52\n00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.947\nwe saw in the last episode that we can\ninstall High Sierra on hardware that's\n\n53\n00:02:03.947 --> 00:02:05.625\ncreeping up on ten years old.\n\n54\n00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.460\nThey do a great job of\nsupporting that hardware.\n\n55\n00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.288\nSo if we just wanna do an upgrade.\n\n56\n00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:16.183\nI'm already running macOS 10.8, or I guess\nit would be OS 10.8 up to that point,\n\n57\n00:02:16.183 --> 00:02:19.300\nbut 10.8 or higher, I wanna do an upgrade.\n\n58\n00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.407\nSo for you, all you would do is fire\nup the App Store, and do a search for\n\n59\n00:02:22.407 --> 00:02:24.330\nHigh Sierra, it will show up right there.\n\n60\n00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.190\nAnd you click Download.\n\n61\n00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.844\nAnd it downloads it, installs it,\nand now you're upgraded.\n\n62\n00:02:29.844 --> 00:02:33.064\nReally couldn't be easier than that.\n&gt;&gt; That's about as easy as it gets.\n\n63\n00:02:33.064 --> 00:02:35.113\n&gt;&gt; Well unless it maybe just did it for\n\n64\n00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.611\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; Unless you say, hey,\n\n65\n00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:39.692\nSiri install macOS High Sierra,\nThen that would be easier.\n\n66\n00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:40.875\nBut other than that.\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n67\n00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:42.598\nwonder how many people's\nphones just activated.\n\n68\n00:02:42.598 --> 00:02:46.330\n[LAUGH] And now they're all upgrading\nto High Sierra thanks to you.\n\n69\n00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.503\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what are you doing, no.\n\n70\n00:02:47.503 --> 00:02:49.096\n&gt;&gt; So that would be pretty easy,\n\n71\n00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:51.555\nif you're doing a straight up upgrade.\n\n72\n00:02:51.555 --> 00:02:56.392\nBut if you have a computer that you've\nreplaced the hard drive on, and so\n\n73\n00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:58.469\nthere is no operating system.\n\n74\n00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.746\nOr you're running something\nolder than 10.8, but\n\n75\n00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:02.690\nyour hardware is still supported.\n\n76\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.738\nAnd that upgrade option, it's not there,\nit's not really available for you.\n\n77\n00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:09.119\nOr may be your operating system is damaged\nand you're just trying to repair it,\n\n78\n00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:13.450\nyou're trying to reinstall the OS so that\nyou can boot your computer back up again.\n\n79\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.690\nThose are a little more involved, and\n\n80\n00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.409\nthat's where we need things like\nour bootable install media.\n\n81\n00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.803\nOr we need to use the recovery console,\nor these other different techniques for\n\n82\n00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:23.420\ninstalling.\n\n83\n00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.522\nAnd that makes it more complex.\n\n84\n00:03:24.522 --> 00:03:27.150\nBut that's not the normal scenario.\n\n85\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.411\nThe normal scenario is we go in the App\nStore and we do the install from there.\n\n86\n00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:35.260\nLet me show you real quick on this\nsystem what that would look like.\n\n87\n00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.203\nBasically what you're gonna do is you're\ngonna jump down into your App Store.\n\n88\n00:03:38.203 --> 00:03:41.938\nAnd if it just came out,\nlike if High Sierra had just released,\n\n89\n00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:44.830\nI'd likely see it in this\nbig banner right here.\n\n90\n00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.434\nThey market it pretty hard in\nthe days leading up to it, but\n\n91\n00:03:47.434 --> 00:03:50.001\nby this point most people\nshould have already upgraded.\n\n92\n00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:54.080\nSo it might show up here, it might be in a\nsub-item, it might show up in these icons.\n\n93\n00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.709\nBut honestly, you can just search for it.\n\n94\n00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.445\nA lot of times it will also\nshow up under your updates, but\n\n95\n00:03:58.445 --> 00:04:00.220\nit'll show up as a optional update.\n\n96\n00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.110\nSo I normally just come to search by name.\n\n97\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.983\nIt's macOS 10.13 High Sierra, so\nI can just type in, High Sierra,\n\n98\n00:04:05.983 --> 00:04:08.900\nthe hardest part is actually spelling it.\n\n99\n00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.174\nAnd once I search for High Sierra,\nit'll turn up right here.\n\n100\n00:04:12.174 --> 00:04:15.753\nI can choose that and then we'll\nsee the options to get in here and\n\n101\n00:04:15.753 --> 00:04:17.230\nget that installed.\n\n102\n00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.480\nIt's not anything too crazy.\n\n103\n00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.131\nWhen we jump in and look at this stuff,\nit's basically just saying, well,\n\n104\n00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:27.860\nyou'll actually see Download\nis what it'll say normally.\n\n105\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.801\nI've already downloaded it on my system.\n\n106\n00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.940\nSo if you've already downloaded it,\nit'll say Open.\n\n107\n00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.764\nWe downloaded it so we can make\nthe USB installer in the last episode.\n\n108\n00:04:34.764 --> 00:04:38.235\nBut once it says, Open,\nyou just click on it and it launches and\n\n109\n00:04:38.235 --> 00:04:39.490\nit runs that install.\n\n110\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.707\nThe first time you download it it actually\nruns it automatically and you just click,\n\n111\n00:04:42.707 --> 00:04:44.353\nNext a few times and that's your upgrade.\n\n112\n00:04:44.353 --> 00:04:46.739\nApple doesn't charge for\nupgrades like these,\n\n113\n00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:48.840\nit's just part of buying their hardware.\n\n114\n00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.227\nIt's one of the big advantages over\nan operating system like Windows,\n\n115\n00:04:51.227 --> 00:04:53.199\nwhere you do have the license\neach version that comes out.\n\n116\n00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.350\nSo that makes the process really easy.\n\n117\n00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.553\nSo in terms of how hard is it to get\nthis installed, it's as simple as that\n\n118\n00:05:00.553 --> 00:05:02.528\nif you're upgrading.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don,\n\n119\n00:05:02.528 --> 00:05:04.610\nif we've got to download it,\nI say, let's do it.\n\n120\n00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.609\nLet's go ahead and install this thing.\n&gt;&gt; All right so\n\n121\n00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:11.170\nif we're doing an upgrade here,\nI would just click the Open and that's it.\n\n122\n00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.044\nBut let's remember that USB install\nwe made in the last episode.\n\n123\n00:05:14.044 --> 00:05:16.620\nSo I've got that,\nI've got it plugged into my system.\n\n124\n00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.984\nActually I see it appear,\nit's this extra disk.\n\n125\n00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:21.980\nI'm not using it right now,\nbut it's there.\n\n126\n00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.020\nWhat we need to do to do the install,\n\n127\n00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.741\nis basically to boot off\nof that USB installer.\n\n128\n00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:28.372\nOr we could also boot to recovery,\n\n129\n00:05:28.372 --> 00:05:31.630\neither one will give us\nthe ability to do the install.\n\n130\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.227\nWe'll talk more about reinstalling\nfrom recovery in our system\n\n131\n00:05:34.227 --> 00:05:35.387\ntroubleshooting episode.\n\n132\n00:05:35.387 --> 00:05:38.740\nWe'll see some neat stuff\nyou can do with it there.\n\n133\n00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.238\nBut the USB installation\nmedia is really easy,\n\n134\n00:05:41.238 --> 00:05:44.807\nI just need to shut the system down and\nthen boot off of that USB disk.\n\n135\n00:05:44.807 --> 00:05:48.070\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and shut us down.\n\n136\n00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.524\nAnd once that's off,\nI'm gonna power the system back on.\n\n137\n00:05:51.524 --> 00:05:54.730\nAnd I need to to tell it\nto boot from the USB key.\n\n138\n00:05:55.798 --> 00:06:00.054\nNow on most devices, if you shut them\ndown, they shut down pretty quickly.\n\n139\n00:06:00.054 --> 00:06:02.292\nBut if you've got FileVault on, like I do,\n\n140\n00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:06.150\nthere's actually some commits going\non in the background right now.\n\n141\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.353\nAnd so just because your screen goes black\ndoesn't mean the system's actually off.\n\n142\n00:06:09.353 --> 00:06:12.740\nSo you've gotta watch the lights\non the front of your system.\n\n143\n00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.032\nAnd I've got a Mac Mini here and\nactually I can't see the light.\n\n144\n00:06:15.032 --> 00:06:16.893\nCan you Daniel, is it?\n&gt;&gt; It is not on.\n\n145\n00:06:16.893 --> 00:06:18.577\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so just watch the lights,\n\n146\n00:06:18.577 --> 00:06:20.510\nthe indicator lights on your system.\n\n147\n00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.115\nMake sure it actually is off.\n\n148\n00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:23.070\nSo my system is off.\n\n149\n00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.685\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit\nthe power button, but before I do,\n\n150\n00:06:27.685 --> 00:06:30.599\nI'm gonna hold the option\nkey on my keyboard.\n\n151\n00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:34.240\nIt may be labeled as the alternate key or\nALT option.\n\n152\n00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.574\nI have an official wired Apple numeric\nkeyboard, the one that has the number pad.\n\n153\n00:06:39.574 --> 00:06:43.390\nAnd it's label's ALT and option, but\noption is the official name of the key.\n\n154\n00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.010\nI'm gonna hold option, and\nI'm gonna hit that power button.\n\n155\n00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.910\nAnd when it boots,\nI'm gonna keep holding option.\n\n156\n00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.380\nI'm gonna hear that Mac tone\nwhere it goes [SOUND] and\n\n157\n00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.186\nthen I'll see the Apple appear, and\nit starts to go though that boot process.\n\n158\n00:06:56.186 --> 00:07:02.580\nAnd instead of doing the normal boot,\nI get this menu right here.\n\n159\n00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.010\nIt's gonna show all the bootable devices\non my system, and I can let go of the ALT,\n\n160\n00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.228\nor option key at this point.\n\n161\n00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:08.600\nAnd now we see it.\n\n162\n00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.316\nNow, quick word of advice,\na few things here.\n\n163\n00:07:12.316 --> 00:07:18.540\nIf you have a wired keyboard like\nthe Apple one that I'm using, this one.\n\n164\n00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.188\nIf it's wired this works\nno problem at all.\n\n165\n00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:25.895\nEven if it's a Microsoft keyboard,\nif it's wired, you just hold that ALT key,\n\n166\n00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:28.250\nworks no problem at all.\n\n167\n00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.626\nIf you have a wireless keyboard,\nif it's an Apple wireless keyboard, or\n\n168\n00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:36.664\nan Apple magic keyboard, those,\nthey actually work here as well.\n\n169\n00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:39.570\nThey connect to the system\nat the firmware level.\n\n170\n00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.862\nAnd so it will know you're holding the\noption key on that wireless keyboard when\n\n171\n00:07:43.862 --> 00:07:45.343\nyou boot up, works great.\n\n172\n00:07:45.343 --> 00:07:50.029\nBut if you're using a wireless\nkeyboard from any other vendor,\n\n173\n00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:53.511\nlike a Logitech keyboard or\nsome other vendor.\n\n174\n00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:56.729\nIt usually won't recognize that option\nkey or that ALT key being pressed,\n\n175\n00:07:56.729 --> 00:07:59.744\ncuz you're on a wireless keyboard and\nit hasn't loaded the drivers or\n\n176\n00:07:59.744 --> 00:08:01.350\nsubsystem for that yet.\n\n177\n00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.938\nSo, be aware of that.\n\n178\n00:08:02.938 --> 00:08:05.081\nBut if you have a hard time\ngetting into this menu,\n\n179\n00:08:05.081 --> 00:08:07.239\nyou might need to get a USB keyboard and\nplug it in.\n\n180\n00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:09.957\nSo I'm one right now so\nthat makes it easier for me.\n\n181\n00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:13.830\nNow once I get in, what I'm seeing\nis a list of my boot devices.\n\n182\n00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.600\nAnd what you should see on most systems,\n\n183\n00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.040\nlet me zoom in a little\nbit cuz it's hard to see.\n\n184\n00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.460\nBut what we're gonna see,\nis typically the Mackintosh hard drive, so\n\n185\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:31.330\nyou will see Macintosh HD and then you'll\nsee install macOS High Sierra, right?\n\n186\n00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.680\nThat's my USB key.\n\n187\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.330\nThe USB key has the installation\nmedia on there, so it shows up and\n\n188\n00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.810\nit detects it that way.\n\n189\n00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:39.620\nIf it didn't detect\nthe installer on there,\n\n190\n00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.490\nit would actually show the USB symbol.\n\n191\n00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.910\nBecause it might be a bootable USB key for\nWindows or Linux or something else, right?\n\n192\n00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.450\nIt doesn't know.\n\n193\n00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.980\nBut it should look like this, all right?\n\n194\n00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.140\nNow, if the Macintosh HD doesn't show up,\n\n195\n00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.120\nthat usually means there's not\nan operating system on it.\n\n196\n00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.190\nOr the operating system has become so\ndamaged that it can't recognize it, right?\n\n197\n00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.410\nIf that's the case,\nthen you need to have the USB key to boot.\n\n198\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.990\nBut if you don't have it either,\nthat's when you have to go to recovery,\n\n199\n00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.990\nwhich we'll talk about in system\ntroubleshooting episodes, all right?\n\n200\n00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.660\nThe only other thing that's here on\nthe screen is the wireless network picker,\n\n201\n00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.470\nwhich I don't really care about right now.\n\n202\n00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.680\nThat will be if I was doing\nInternet recovery and\n\n203\n00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.070\nwe will see that in another episode.\n\n204\n00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.640\nBut I want to install from that USB key,\nso I'm gonna chose that one and\n\n205\n00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.580\nthat's gonna kick off that\ninstallation process, all right?\n\n206\n00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.630\nSo, I'm gonna chose that, and\nI'll hit the arrow to get that started and\n\n207\n00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.680\nlet me zoom that back out a bit.\n\n208\n00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.600\nAnd now it's gonna go through what looks\nlike the normal boot process, right?\n\n209\n00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.380\nExcept it's not booting off the hard\ndrive, it's booting off the USB key.\n\n210\n00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.360\nThis is important because the hard drive\nhas, well, an older version of macOS.\n\n211\n00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.690\nMaybe it's running 10.12, or 10.9, right?\n\n212\n00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.900\nIt can be running 10.8, or higher.\n\n213\n00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.110\nAnd that's okay.\n\n214\n00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.280\nIt can even be running something older,\nif we're not doing an upgrade.\n\n215\n00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.200\nIf we're doing a fresh install,\nthen it doesn't matter.\n\n216\n00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.370\nBut in this case,\nit's going to boot off the USB key,\n\n217\n00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.320\nwhich is going to boot the macOS\nHigh Sierra installer.\n\n218\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.330\nAnd once I'm in there,\nI'll see a handful of options.\n\n219\n00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.490\nOne of them actually just says,\ninstall macOS, and so\n\n220\n00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:12.000\nI can click that, run through a quick\nwizard, and then we get it installed.\n\n221\n00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.950\nSo that's the basic process,\nwe just have to wait for\n\n222\n00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.940\nthis little bar to creep across.\n\n223\n00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.864\nIt takes almost long enough to be annoying\nbut like not long enough to go and\n\n224\n00:10:21.864 --> 00:10:25.834\nget a cup of coffee,\nit's quick enough but it'll move through.\n\n225\n00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:30.323\nAnd the reason it takes a while is it's\ntaking operating system on the USB key and\n\n226\n00:10:30.323 --> 00:10:31.865\nit's copying it into RAM.\n\n227\n00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:35.537\nAnd USB is not the fastest thing\nin the world even with the USB 3,\n\n228\n00:10:35.537 --> 00:10:39.617\nit can take a little while to get that\nloaded into RAM, uncompress it and\n\n229\n00:10:39.617 --> 00:10:43.770\nbasically boot a whole copy of macOS\njust from the memory in your system.\n\n230\n00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:48.540\nBut it does this stuff all for us, we just\nsee this little bar icon on the screen.\n\n231\n00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:55.500\nAll right, now once I'm in here,\nI have a couple of decisions to make.\n\n232\n00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.960\nI'll see options in here where I\ncan pick some different tools.\n\n233\n00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.100\nI can access the help if I want to\nsee the system requirements, here.\n\n234\n00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:02.665\n&gt;&gt; There it goes.\n\n235\n00:11:02.665 --> 00:11:05.278\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But you guys get the point.\n\n236\n00:11:05.278 --> 00:11:06.331\n&gt;&gt; Just enough to be in there.\n\n237\n00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:08.409\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wasn't long enough, yeah,\n\n238\n00:11:08.409 --> 00:11:09.960\nI couldn't say let's take a coffee break.\n\n239\n00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.970\nBut anyhow, so here's my options.\n\n240\n00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.950\nThere's not a ton of stuff to pick from.\n\n241\n00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.210\nAnd let me zoom in on this\nagain cuz it is tiny.\n\n242\n00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.580\nBut what we'll see is\nRestore From Time Machine Backup.\n\n243\n00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.424\nHey, if my system is damaged and\nI don't wanna go to High Sierra,\n\n244\n00:11:23.424 --> 00:11:26.961\nI just wanna get my system working again,\nrestore from back up, great, right?\n\n245\n00:11:26.961 --> 00:11:30.610\nBut option number two,\ninstall macOS, right?\n\n246\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.140\nAnd so it's telling me right here\nthat I can install a new copy.\n\n247\n00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.840\nA nice, new, shiny copy and\nget that up and going.\n\n248\n00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.570\nI can go help online or I can use\nthe Disk Utility to modify my disks.\n\n249\n00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.260\nI want to install, so, pretty easy there.\n\n250\n00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:48.020\nWe choose, and it tells us it's going to\nupgrade or install a new copy of macOS.\n\n251\n00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.690\nAnd as we move forward\nwith that installation,\n\n252\n00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.818\nwhat we're going to see is really just\nsome very simple, generic questions.\n\n253\n00:11:54.818 --> 00:11:58.610\nThere's really only two decisions that\nI have to make during this install.\n\n254\n00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.140\nThe first decision I have to make is\n\n255\n00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.790\nwhether I wanna accept [LAUGH]\nthe license agreement.\n\n256\n00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.027\nYou don't really have a choice,\nwe're going to have to accept that.\n\n257\n00:12:06.027 --> 00:12:08.369\nAnd then the second\ndecision I have to make is,\n\n258\n00:12:08.369 --> 00:12:10.541\nwhich hard drive do I\nwant to install it on?\n\n259\n00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:15.476\nNow, every Mac made in the last\nthree years only has one hard drive,\n\n260\n00:12:15.476 --> 00:12:18.000\nwith the exception of the Mac Pro.\n\n261\n00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.571\nThe Mac Pro might have more\nthan one hard drive, and so\n\n262\n00:12:20.571 --> 00:12:24.010\nnow it's really important\nyou pick the right one.\n\n263\n00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.500\nOlder Macs, though, like older Mac Minis,\nthey supported two hard drives.\n\n264\n00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.720\nLots of people did that.\n\n265\n00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.970\nSo, that decision may be important,\nor may not.\n\n266\n00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:32.940\nFor most of us,\n\n267\n00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:37.580\nit's gonna look like what I'm about to see\nhere, where I just get two choices, right?\n\n268\n00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.200\nThey're not even really\nsignificant choices.\n\n269\n00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.865\nIf I zoom back in on those things,\nI can see where I've got my\n\n270\n00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:48.725\nMacintosh hard drive which is\na 250 gig SSD in this system.\n\n271\n00:12:48.725 --> 00:12:53.580\nOr I've got install macOS High Sierra,\nthat's my USB key.\n\n272\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.240\nDoesn't make sense to install on\nthe USB key, so it's grayed out.\n\n273\n00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.870\nI actually can't choose that, if you try\nit won't let you and it tells you why.\n\n274\n00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.570\nAnd it's just saying home\npartition scheme, in this case.\n\n275\n00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.520\nThat is nice, though, if you can't install\nto a hard drive it'll tell you why and\n\n276\n00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.060\nlet you know.\n\n277\n00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.425\nBut in my case, this is the drive I want.\n\n278\n00:13:11.425 --> 00:13:12.360\nSo I can choose it, and\n\n279\n00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.630\nit's telling me that High Sierra will\nbe installed right here on this disk.\n\n280\n00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.680\nAnd when I click Install,\nthat's the last it needs from me.\n\n281\n00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.560\nNow it's gonna go through,\nput that installation on there, and\n\n282\n00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.410\nget macOS High Sierra installed.\n&gt;&gt; Don,\n\n283\n00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:29.920\nI really like the fact that it can keep\nyou from selecting the wrong drive.\n\n284\n00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.180\nLike what you have here where it says,\nit's kinda grayed out and then it's kinda\n\n285\n00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.410\nsteer you towards the right area and then\ngiving you reasons if it can't install.\n\n286\n00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.400\nSo that's very,\nvery nice in the installation process.\n\n287\n00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.163\nNow that being said, and once you click\ninstall, what is the installation\n\n288\n00:13:43.163 --> 00:13:45.810\nprocess doing to that hard drive?\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n289\n00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:51.070\nimportant question because when I click\ninstall, what does happen to my computer?\n\n290\n00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.590\nSo, this is my Mac Mini and\nit's not a props,\n\n291\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.020\nit's actually the one I\nuse in my office normally.\n\n292\n00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.070\nSo, it has all my data on there, right?\n\n293\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.270\nAnd what's gonna happen to my\ndata when I hit the install?\n\n294\n00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.140\nWell, if I were to hit install right now,\n\n295\n00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.790\nit's gonna do what's called\na non-destructive install.\n\n296\n00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.235\nIn other words,\nit's gonna leave my documents there.\n\n297\n00:14:12.235 --> 00:14:14.160\nIt's gonna leave my applications there.\n\n298\n00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.580\nAll of my files and folders and all that\ngood stuff, it's gonna leave them alone.\n\n299\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.870\nAnd it's gonna copy the macOS\nHigh Sierra operating system on top of\n\n300\n00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.550\nwhatever operating system\nwas already there.\n\n301\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.270\nSo if I already have High Sierra,\nit's effectively replacing the files,\n\n302\n00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.640\nwhich is a great way to\nrepair a damaged OS.\n\n303\n00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.490\nIf I was running El Capitan or\nregular Sierra,\n\n304\n00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:38.710\nthen it's going to copy the new OS, which\neffectively upgrades me to High Sierra.\n\n305\n00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.180\nBut the key thing here is that\nit's nondestructive, right?\n\n306\n00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.290\nI hear from a lot of people where they\nsay, man, my system is in a boot loop.\n\n307\n00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.050\nIt goes to boot, it crashes, it reboots.\n\n308\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.470\nI can't get into it.\n\n309\n00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.660\nWell, hey, boot off install media,\nreinstall.\n\n310\n00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.540\nAll your data, all your apps will still\nbe there, you'll be back in business.\n\n311\n00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.620\nAll right,\nthis a great easy way to do that.\n\n312\n00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.750\nSo that's what gonna happen if I\nhit install and we move forward.\n\n313\n00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:05.760\nBut if I wanna do a clean install,\nthat doesn't help me, right?\n\n314\n00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.760\nIf I wanna do a clean install,\nI might wanna get rid of my applications,\n\n315\n00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.600\nI wanna start over.\n\n316\n00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.040\nMaybe I'm about to give\nthis computer to Daniel.\n\n317\n00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.540\nI'm like, yeah, I'm done with this thing,\nlet me give it to him.\n\n318\n00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.290\nI don't want it junked up\nwith all my applications or\n\n319\n00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:23.000\nI don't want it auto logging\ninto my email or whatever.\n\n320\n00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.975\nI don't trust Daniel, and\nit's just between the two of us.\n\n321\n00:15:25.975 --> 00:15:27.636\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:15:27.636 --> 00:15:30.517\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I wanna clean this off,\n\n323\n00:15:30.517 --> 00:15:31.570\nright?\n\n324\n00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.210\nAnd then give it to him.\n\n325\n00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:34.450\nWell, it doesn't do a clean install.\n\n326\n00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.150\nIn fact it doesn't even\ngive me that choice.\n\n327\n00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.020\nIt says, we'll install or\nupgrade but it doesn't say, hey,\n\n328\n00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.150\nyou want to erase your data?\n\n329\n00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.750\nIt doesn't give you that choice.\n\n330\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.590\nSo if I want to do that, I've got to\njump over to the disk utility, and\n\n331\n00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.200\nin the disk utility I can erase my system.\n\n332\n00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.609\nI can erase the drive and put it that way.\n\n333\n00:15:51.609 --> 00:15:54.090\nSo, if I get out of the installer.\n\n334\n00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.455\nI'm gonna go back up here to this\ninstall macOS High Sierra and\n\n335\n00:15:57.455 --> 00:15:59.406\nI'll choose to quit that install.\n\n336\n00:15:59.406 --> 00:16:01.720\nBack here on the main screen, right?\n\n337\n00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.513\nIf we look at all the options that\nwe had kinda tuck away in here,\n\n338\n00:16:05.513 --> 00:16:08.650\none of those options was disk utility.\n\n339\n00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.980\nSo I can fire up the disk utility,\nit will show me my hard drive and\n\n340\n00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.760\nfrom there I can erase the disk.\n\n341\n00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.771\nAnd once it's erased,\nI know that my data is clear, and\n\n342\n00:16:17.771 --> 00:16:21.437\nI can go and do what would actually\nbe a clean and solve at that point.\n\n343\n00:16:21.437 --> 00:16:23.582\nSo here, I'm looking at my system.\n\n344\n00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:24.366\nIt shows my disks.\n\n345\n00:16:24.366 --> 00:16:28.500\nIt shows the installation\nmedia among some other things.\n\n346\n00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.290\nAgain, if we zoom back on that\nwe can see the Macintosh HD, and\n\n347\n00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.380\nthere's my installer.\n\n348\n00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.280\nAnd the installer has\nsome virtual disks on it.\n\n349\n00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.880\nThat's what are showing up here.\n\n350\n00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.609\nESD is the install emergency system disk.\n\n351\n00:16:43.609 --> 00:16:47.216\nIt's not really an emergency here but\nthat's what they used to call it.\n\n352\n00:16:47.216 --> 00:16:51.093\nBut if I choose this Macintosh HD\nthat's my internal hard drive, right.\n\n353\n00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:53.092\nI can see it's an APFS volume.\n\n354\n00:16:53.092 --> 00:16:55.253\nIt's got the Apple file system on it.\n\n355\n00:16:55.253 --> 00:16:55.872\nIt's formatted.\n\n356\n00:16:55.872 --> 00:16:57.219\nIt's got a bunch of data.\n\n357\n00:16:57.219 --> 00:16:58.610\nIt's got 140 gigs of data on there.\n\n358\n00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:03.980\nSo if I'm about to give this system to\nsomebody else, then that's my data.\n\n359\n00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.220\nSo I can just hit this Erase\nbutton right here at the top, and\n\n360\n00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.910\nwhen you hit Erase, that's gonna\nwipe that disk and erase it and\n\n361\n00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.540\nget it where I can hand\nit over to somebody else.\n\n362\n00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.730\nIt's gonna take the disk, and\nit's gonna make it one big partition.\n\n363\n00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.140\nOne big volume.\n\n364\n00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.860\nAnd that's normally what we want.\n\n365\n00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.317\nI've got a 250 gig disc here.\n\n366\n00:17:23.317 --> 00:17:25.321\nIt's gonna make one big 250 gig volume.\n\n367\n00:17:25.321 --> 00:17:27.030\nThat's called Macintosh HD.\n\n368\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.730\nAnd that's where my operating\nsystem is gonna go.\n\n369\n00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.130\nAnd when I hit erase,\nthat's just gonna churn through.\n\n370\n00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.360\nIt usually doesn't take very long.\n\n371\n00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.230\nAnd when it's done, now the disc is empty.\n\n372\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.620\nAnd so now,\nif I exit back out to the main screen,\n\n373\n00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.890\nI can choose to do the install again,\nand this time,\n\n374\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.940\nit'll be a nice, clean install.\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, we've talked about upgrading.\n\n375\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.090\nWe've looked now at clean installation.\n\n376\n00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.610\nTwo very simple procedures for us.\n\n377\n00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.200\nEither or if we were needing to do that.\n\n378\n00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.230\nBut what are some other considerations\nthat we might need to come into,\n\n379\n00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.800\nwhere we might choose something different\n\n380\n00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.590\nto go down that road?\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n381\n00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:09.120\nSo the description I just gave you guys\nfor all the hard drive will be let out.\n\n382\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.740\nOne big partition.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n383\n00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.370\n&gt;&gt; And for\n\n384\n00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.690\nmost of us, that's what we want.\n\n385\n00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:18.940\nI have three Macs right, so\nI have two Mac Mannes and a MacBook Pro.\n\n386\n00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.540\nAll three of them,\n\n387\n00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.840\nI just have one big partition on\nthe internal disk, it's easier, right?\n\n388\n00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.400\nYour operating system, your files are all\nthere, it's just one big disk, right?\n\n389\n00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.360\nBut there are experience that\nremind what more than one disk.\n\n390\n00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.482\nMaybe you work with database files.\n\n391\n00:18:33.482 --> 00:18:34.980\nDatabase files have a tendency to grow.\n\n392\n00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:41.700\nWell, using this disk as an example,\nif my disk starts to fill up, right.\n\n393\n00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.045\nHere I see it's empty now, right.\n\n394\n00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:46.453\nSo if I fill it up,\nthe operating system needs some space.\n\n395\n00:18:46.453 --> 00:18:51.320\nIt needs some space for a page file, for\ndoing disk space memory and other things.\n\n396\n00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.680\nIf it runs out of hard drive space,\nit can make the operating system lock up.\n\n397\n00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.210\nAnd now, my computer becomes unusable, and\n\n398\n00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.350\nI've gotta go in recovery and\ntry and fix it.\n\n399\n00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:00.960\nThat's a problem.\nMost of us aren't gonna do it.\n\n400\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.490\nMost of us aren't gonna\nfill up our hard drive.\n\n401\n00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.520\nBut if you're worried about that,\nif you have a software needed for\n\n402\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.650\nthat, you can do more than one partition.\n\n403\n00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.580\nYou can divide the disk in half or\nhowever you want it.\n\n404\n00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:14.430\nIf you divide the disk up, you create\nthese little boundaries and you can say,\n\n405\n00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.480\nlook, I'm gonna put my database\nstuff in this second partition.\n\n406\n00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.000\nAnd if it fills up that's no big deal\n\n407\n00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.890\ncuz the operating system is on its own\npartition, and it has its own space.\n\n408\n00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.690\nIts own free space available.\n\n409\n00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.190\nIf you want to do that,\ndon't use the erase button,\n\n410\n00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.710\ninstead use the partition button.\n\n411\n00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.400\nChoose your disk, and if you're seeing\nyour physical disk in multiple partitions\n\n412\n00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.460\nalready, make sure you choose\nthe physical disk itself, right?\n\n413\n00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.730\nI only have this one partition so\nit doesn't really matter for me.\n\n414\n00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.030\nI'm gonna go ahead and choose partition.\n\n415\n00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.990\nAnd now,\nit's gonna ask me about what I'm doing.\n\n416\n00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:52.480\nNow, I have the Apple File System on mine,\nAPFS.\n\n417\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.830\nAnd APFS has a slightly different\npartitioning scheme than what the older\n\n418\n00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.130\nsystems did.\n\n419\n00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.140\nIf you're doing a clean install,\nyou'll want to do the APFS way.\n\n420\n00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.240\nAPFS always does one big partition, but\n\n421\n00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.070\nthen it creates these\nlogical volumes inside of it.\n\n422\n00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:13.180\nAnd so that what it's saying here is,\nDon, are you sure you want to partition?\n\n423\n00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.240\nThat's the old way.\n\n424\n00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.120\nDo you want to just add\nsome volumes instead?\n\n425\n00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.730\nAnd then I can add volumes here and\nit's no big deal.\n\n426\n00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.480\nThat would be the APFS way, right?\n\n427\n00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.170\nSo it's giving me that choice.\n\n428\n00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.380\nRight now, I have one big APFS volume.\n\n429\n00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.560\nSo I can choose to add a volume.\n\n430\n00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.000\nAnd now, it's going to come in here and\nlet me pick.\n\n431\n00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.810\nAnd it doesn't ask for\na lot of information.\n\n432\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.940\nJust give it a Name and a Format.\n\n433\n00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:38.440\nAnd then, I can go in to my size options\nhere, and I can set a reserved size.\n\n434\n00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.210\nLike I need to set aside this\namount of space for this volume.\n\n435\n00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.520\nAnd I can set a quota size\nwhich will be like a maximum.\n\n436\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.280\nThis is the maximum this disk can become.\n\n437\n00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.190\nSo if I'm going to have my\noperating system on one volume.\n\n438\n00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.670\nWell, it's already made one volume for\nme, called Mac and Tush HD.\n\n439\n00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.950\nI can create another volume and maybe,\nI want to cap this one at a hundred gigs.\n\n440\n00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.080\nSo I'll say it,\nI'm gonna copy that 100 gigs, and\n\n441\n00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.170\nI'm gonna call this one database.\n\n442\n00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.307\nThis is where I'm gonna\nput my database files.\n\n443\n00:21:03.307 --> 00:21:08.863\nAnd now, when I add that it's gonna\nadd that volume, all right so\n\n444\n00:21:08.863 --> 00:21:14.116\nthere it is done, and\nwhen I look at the disk layout over here,\n\n445\n00:21:14.116 --> 00:21:17.472\nI see what looks like two disks, okay.\n\n446\n00:21:17.472 --> 00:21:24.120\nIn reality, it's one physical disk\nthat has one big APFS partition on it.\n\n447\n00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.470\nAnd then inside of it,\nit has two APFS volumes.\n\n448\n00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:28.860\nOne called Macintosh HD.\n\n449\n00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.230\nOne called database.\n\n450\n00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.880\nThe database one is capped at 100 gigs.\n\n451\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.460\nI set a quota.\n\n452\n00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.230\nIt won't be allowed to grow\nbeyond a hundred gigs.\n\n453\n00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.000\nIf I hadn't done that, it'd be able to\ngrow to as large as it wanted, right.\n\n454\n00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.140\nIt would see that as an available option.\n\n455\n00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:45.740\nIn fact, it's kinda neat when you look\nat disk sizes inside of APFS ones.\n\n456\n00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:46.940\nSometimes, they can look like\n\n457\n00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.050\nthey are 67 terabytes.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n458\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.580\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure exactly how they reach\n\n459\n00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.440\nthat number but that means that it's\nallowed to expand as big you want.\n\n460\n00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.980\nIn reality, it can only expand as\nbig as the disk it's sitting on.\n\n461\n00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.270\nThat's kind of the limit.\n\n462\n00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.690\nSo that's the new way\nof doing partitioning.\n\n463\n00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.580\nIf you wanna divide stuff up,\nyou just add volumes.\n\n464\n00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.140\nAdd as many as you need, right?\n\n465\n00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.640\nThe old way,\nif I'd chose Partition here, and\n\n466\n00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.700\ntold it I wanted to actually partition\nthis disk, I would get this screen.\n\n467\n00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.920\nAnd this screen is different.\n\n468\n00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.460\nLet me make this a little bit bigger.\n\n469\n00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.320\nActually, here, I think I can just\nzoom this one all the way all out.\n\n470\n00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:25.070\nSo, this one,\nit shows me this pie chart, right?\n\n471\n00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.630\nAnd you could just sit here, and\n\n472\n00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:31.210\nhit the plus button to add in more slices,\nas many as you need.\n\n473\n00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:31.830\nRight?\n\n474\n00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:36.200\nBut unlike a volume, an APFS volume,\nwhere it's just a logical entity\n\n475\n00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.640\nThese are boundaries that are being\nset that are really hard to change.\n\n476\n00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.890\nAnd if your system had boot camp before,\nyou already have at least one of these,\n\n477\n00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.130\nwhere it shrinks your Apple file system\nto make room for a Windows file system or\n\n478\n00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.210\non windows, right?\n\n479\n00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:49.830\nWill see that in the boot camp episodes.\n\n480\n00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.800\nBut that's another scenario where we\nmight wanna do partitioning like this.\n\n481\n00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.010\nIf you're gonna boot camp,\nMicrosoft can't read APFS..\n\n482\n00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:58.919\nThey read NTFS.\n\n483\n00:22:58.919 --> 00:23:04.030\nThey read their own file system and Apple\ncan read NTFS but it can't write to NTFS.\n\n484\n00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.630\nSo it doesn't fully\nsupport that file system.\n\n485\n00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.810\nSo I need separate partitions for\nthat and so.\n\n486\n00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.370\nWe consider and\ndice it up however that is we want, and\n\n487\n00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.740\nonce we get everything set the way that we\nneed it here, now we're good to go, right?\n\n488\n00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:22.150\nAt this point, I've erased my drive, and\nI've created this second volume on it,\n\n489\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:26.780\nwhich honestly I could a second volume\nafter the install, for all that matters,\n\n490\n00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.290\nbut doing it here in the install is\nalways a little bit easier for us.\n\n491\n00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:34.040\nSo now that I've got that, I can come\nback out here and start my install again.\n\n492\n00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.424\nAnd when I start that install, remember\nthe simple questions that we get asked?\n\n493\n00:23:37.424 --> 00:23:41.927\nI'm gonna call them simple to their\nkind of [INAUDIBLE] but that's,\n\n494\n00:23:41.927 --> 00:23:45.251\nit's a little on a too big size there,\nisn't it?\n\n495\n00:23:45.251 --> 00:23:49.845\nBut basically, when I come in here\nI'm going to start my install,\n\n496\n00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:52.320\nI get the license agreement stuff.\n\n497\n00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.265\nThat's the same, but now,\nwhen I get to the disk screen,\n\n498\n00:23:55.265 --> 00:23:57.140\nI have more than one choice, right?\n\n499\n00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.935\nBecause I created more than one volume.\n\n500\n00:23:58.935 --> 00:24:02.382\nAnd when I look at that,\nI just need to pick the right one.\n\n501\n00:24:02.382 --> 00:24:04.831\nIf I pick the wrong one, it's kinda hard\nto change these stuff after the fact-\n\n502\n00:24:04.831 --> 00:24:05.407\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n503\n00:24:05.407 --> 00:24:06.910\n&gt;&gt; I'd have to reinstall.\n\n504\n00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.591\nBut I see Macintosh HD,\nwhich shows up as 250 gigs, and\n\n505\n00:24:10.591 --> 00:24:13.839\nthere's Database,\nthat shows up as 100 gigs.\n\n506\n00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:18.589\nNow Macintosh HD shows up as 250 gigs,\nI've got a 250-gig drive.\n\n507\n00:24:18.589 --> 00:24:23.630\nIf I put 100 gigs of data in Database,\nMacintosh HD can only hold 150 gigs.\n\n508\n00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.599\nSo remember, you're, what's the saying?\n\n509\n00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:28.184\nYou're robbing Peter-\n&gt;&gt; Robbing Peter to pay Paul?\n\n510\n00:24:28.184 --> 00:24:28.958\n&gt;&gt; To pay Paul, yeah.\n\n511\n00:24:28.958 --> 00:24:30.547\nI'm bad with my biblical abilities.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n512\n00:24:30.547 --> 00:24:31.263\n&gt;&gt; Whatever,\n\n513\n00:24:31.263 --> 00:24:33.631\nI don't even know what they call them.\n\n514\n00:24:33.631 --> 00:24:37.271\nSo anyhow, it's kind like that,\nyou are kind of sharing a space.\n\n515\n00:24:37.271 --> 00:24:41.273\nSame thing with partitions\nexcept it's a hard line on that.\n\n516\n00:24:41.273 --> 00:24:45.231\nIf I've done a partition, Macintosh HD\nwould've gone down to 150 gigs.\n\n517\n00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:46.048\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n518\n00:24:46.048 --> 00:24:47.714\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz it's a hard limit,\n\n519\n00:24:47.714 --> 00:24:50.007\nversus here, where it's a logical limit.\n\n520\n00:24:50.007 --> 00:24:52.156\nBut now I can just pick that disk, whoops,\n\n521\n00:24:52.156 --> 00:24:53.538\nI almost picked Database.\n\n522\n00:24:53.538 --> 00:24:54.483\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n523\n00:24:54.483 --> 00:24:55.410\n&gt;&gt; I can pick that disk,\n\n524\n00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.420\nI can hit Install, and off it goes,\nit's going to do the install.\n\n525\n00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.892\nAnd I'll tell you,\nit says it's gonna take about two minutes.\n\n526\n00:25:00.892 --> 00:25:02.715\nIt's copying some files,\nIt's gonna reboot,\n\n527\n00:25:02.715 --> 00:25:04.860\nand then it will take another\n12 minutes on top of that.\n\n528\n00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.080\nSo it does take a little bit longer\nthan what they show right here.\n\n529\n00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:08.950\n&gt;&gt; Although in a perfect world,\n\n530\n00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:11.210\nwe we'd be wrapping\nthe episode at about this time.\n\n531\n00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:15.040\nBut as always, there's these little\ncaveats, things we've gotta look out for.\n\n532\n00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.202\nWhat happens if this\ndoesn't get to completion,\n\n533\n00:25:17.202 --> 00:25:18.620\nwhat if it fails out?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n534\n00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.130\nfailure does happen sometimes, and\n\n535\n00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.780\nlet see if I can catch this\nfast enough before it reboot.\n\n536\n00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.487\nDuring the installer, up top,\nyou've got this Window menu.\n\n537\n00:25:25.487 --> 00:25:31.770\nAnd in that Window menu, you actually have\nan option to view the installation logs.\n\n538\n00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.760\nSo I'm coming here to Installer Log.\n\n539\n00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.784\nAnd when you do that, it's gonna add\nthis crazy window down at the bottom of\n\n540\n00:25:36.784 --> 00:25:39.154\nthe screen, where you can\nactually see what's going on.\n\n541\n00:25:39.154 --> 00:25:40.815\nYou get this text output\nthat's scrolling across, and\n\n542\n00:25:40.815 --> 00:25:42.600\nletting you know what happening.\n\n543\n00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.040\nAnd if an error happens,\nit'll show up right here.\n\n544\n00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.845\nAnd if the installer fails,\njust to give you a chance to read it and\n\n545\n00:25:47.845 --> 00:25:49.170\nsee what's going on.\n\n546\n00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.745\nAnd you can kind of see it all\nscrolling across right now,\n\n547\n00:25:51.745 --> 00:25:53.475\nand there goes the reboot.\n&gt;&gt; There,\n\n548\n00:25:53.475 --> 00:25:56.039\nit went crazy.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so my install is working\n\n549\n00:25:56.039 --> 00:26:00.740\nproperly, thank goodness, so I didn't\nget any errors to show up in there.\n\n550\n00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.536\nBut what's gonna happen is,\nit's gonna reboot,\n\n551\n00:26:02.536 --> 00:26:04.769\nyou saw my screen kind of flicker there,\nthat said rebooting.\n\n552\n00:26:04.769 --> 00:26:07.670\nAnd then here, it's gonna\ncontinue with the actual install.\n\n553\n00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.534\nAnd it told me two minutes remaining, but\n\n554\n00:26:09.534 --> 00:26:11.782\nthat was just to copy the boot files over,\nright?\n\n555\n00:26:11.782 --> 00:26:15.350\nNow it's gonna reboot and, or\nit was already, it was rebooted.\n\n556\n00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.848\nAnd when the installer actually starts,\n\n557\n00:26:16.848 --> 00:26:18.744\nit'll say something like\n12 minutes remaining.\n\n558\n00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:21.645\nAnd so we'll end up with about\na 15-minute install window,\n\n559\n00:26:21.645 --> 00:26:23.680\nit's about as fast as\nit gets these things.\n\n560\n00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.953\nAnd once it's installed, then it'll\nactually launch into the OS, and\n\n561\n00:26:27.953 --> 00:26:30.736\nwe can run through the initial\nconfiguration of this system.\n\n562\n00:26:30.736 --> 00:26:31.863\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Don,\n\n563\n00:26:31.863 --> 00:26:35.573\nI guess we won't torture our audience with\nmaking them watch the progress bar go by\n\n564\n00:26:35.573 --> 00:26:36.780\nfor 12 to 15 minutes.\n\n565\n00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.560\nAnd we'll go ahead and\ncall this an episode.\n\n566\n00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.311\nAnything else you wanna add to\nthe show before we call it a day?\n\n567\n00:26:41.311 --> 00:26:42.076\n&gt;&gt; Main thing here is,\n\n568\n00:26:42.076 --> 00:26:43.698\nyou got a lot of choices for installation.\n\n569\n00:26:43.698 --> 00:26:45.959\nThere's even some more\nadvanced options for\n\n570\n00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:49.460\ndoing installs that aren't part\nof the ACSP certification.\n\n571\n00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.485\nIf you ever get bored,\ngot to Apple's website and look for\n\n572\n00:26:52.485 --> 00:26:56.278\ninformation on NetInstall, or\nbuilding custom installation images.\n\n573\n00:26:56.278 --> 00:26:58.879\nYou can do installs off of\nservers in your own network.\n\n574\n00:26:58.879 --> 00:27:02.044\nAnd you can build custom install images\nthat already have that applications\n\n575\n00:27:02.044 --> 00:27:03.250\ninstalled on there.\n\n576\n00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.320\nSo you can quickly deploy\nmachines that are ready for\n\n577\n00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.650\nyour employees to start using,\nit's really cool stuff.\n\n578\n00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.530\nDefinitely something you want to learn\nabout in a business environment,\n\n579\n00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.463\nnot terribly useful for home users.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Don, thanks so\n\n580\n00:27:13.463 --> 00:27:14.489\nmuch for dropping by and\n\n581\n00:27:14.489 --> 00:27:17.850\nhelping us get a little further down\nthe line as we work with installations.\n\n582\n00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.768\nAnd I'm looking forward to seeing what\nyou have upcoming in the series, but\n\n583\n00:27:20.768 --> 00:27:22.145\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n584\n00:27:22.145 --> 00:27:24.700\nWe do thank you, good audience,\nfor joining us as well.\n\n585\n00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.261\nWe always appreciate our\nviewers out there, but\n\n586\n00:27:26.261 --> 00:27:27.412\nwe’re gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n587\n00:27:27.412 --> 00:27:28.152\nFor ITProTV,\n\n588\n00:27:28.152 --> 00:27:31.178\nI’ve been you host, Daniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt; And I’m Don Pezet.\n\n589\n00:27:31.178 --> 00:27:32.170\n&gt;&gt; We’ll see you next time.\n\n590\n00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:39.084\n[MUSIC]\n\n591\n00:27:39.084 --> 00:27:41.730\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

All right,\n\n4\n00:00:12.505 --> 00:00:16.412\ngreetings everyone, and welcome back\nto another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:20.225\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we've got a real treat for\n\n6\n00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:23.080\nyou, because we're back with\nmore in our ACSP series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.994\nJoining us the studio yet again,\nlending his expertise on that subject,\n\n8\n00:00:25.994 --> 00:00:27.360\nour good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.580\nDon, we're so glad to have you back.\n\n10\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.751\nHow is it going today?\n&gt;&gt; It is going great, Daniel, and\n\n11\n00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:34.151\nin this episode we're gonna be kind of\nbuilding on to what we talked about in our\n\n12\n00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:35.037\nprevious episode.\n\n13\n00:00:35.037 --> 00:00:38.667\nYou've been watching them all, and our\nlast episode we had a chance to see what\n\n14\n00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:40.608\nwas it like to install MAC OS high series.\n\n15\n00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:43.423\nWe went through that installation process\nand saw everything we needed to do.\n\n16\n00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:46.426\nGot to the really exciting\n12 minutes remaining screen,\n\n17\n00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:49.800\nkinda let that one run out, but\nbasically that was the installer.\n\n18\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.280\nIt wasn't anything too\nterribly crazy there.\n\n19\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.850\nBut it was all done assuming that\nthings worked the right way.\n\n20\n00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.450\nThat our system was able to\nbuild the install media or\n\n21\n00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.690\ndo the upgrade through the App Store or\nwhatever.\n\n22\n00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.720\nAnd that's not always the case.\n\n23\n00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.770\nSometimes your computer\ngets totally horsed and\n\n24\n00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.120\nyou can't get in there to do things and\nyou need to be able to recover.\n\n25\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.885\nAnd so what we're gonna take a look\nat in this episode are some of\n\n26\n00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.546\nthe tools that are available to\nhelp us recover our operating\n\n27\n00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:18.153\nsystem, get our system back\nonline in the event that we have\n\n28\n00:01:18.153 --> 00:01:19.400\na failure.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don,\n\n29\n00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.410\nI guess the first place to start\nin this episode would be then,\n\n30\n00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.595\nwhat can cause our system to become\ndamaged, and why does Apple ignore this?\n\n31\n00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:28.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, [LAUGH] so\n\n32\n00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.762\nfortunately Apple doesn't ignore it.\n&gt;&gt; They say it just works though [LAUGH]\n\n33\n00:01:32.762 --> 00:01:35.024\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is supposed to just work,\n\n34\n00:01:35.024 --> 00:01:39.406\nbut if it just worked perfectly,\nthey wouldn't have Apple Care.\n\n35\n00:01:39.406 --> 00:01:40.344\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n36\n00:01:40.344 --> 00:01:43.565\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So any hardware device can fail, right?\n\n37\n00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:46.230\nThings can go wrong, and\nthen software can fail.\n\n38\n00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.690\nEspecially third party software that\nhasn't had a lot of scrutiny to it.\n\n39\n00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.670\nThese are all areas where we can\nintroduce failure into our systems.\n\n40\n00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.270\nSo hardware though is typically\none of the big causes of this.\n\n41\n00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.720\nIf you have RAM that's going bad in\nyour system, that's a really tricky one,\n\n42\n00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.650\nbecause RAM does go bad and\n\n43\n00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.670\nwhen it happens it usually manifests\nitself as a problem with something else.\n\n44\n00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.650\nLike you're trying to open a file on\nthe hard drive and the file is corrupt.\n\n45\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.900\nWell, my first thought is\nthe hard drive's failing, great.\n\n46\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.940\nBut when you open a file from the hard\ndrive, it copies the file onto RAM and\n\n47\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.530\nthen actually opens it from RAM.\n\n48\n00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.950\nSo if your RAM is bad,\nthe file is going to be corrupt.\n\n49\n00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.810\nAnd so it can misrepresent itself.\n\n50\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.550\nYou can identify things\ncoming from the wrong source.\n\n51\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.130\nYou see the symptom, not necessarily the\ncause, and so that makes it really tricky.\n\n52\n00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.310\nBut failing hardware is probably\nthe number one reason why you\n\n53\n00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.860\nmight not be able to boot\ninto your operating system.\n\n54\n00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.430\nIf you have a spinning hard drive in\nyour system, a traditional hard drive,\n\n55\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.260\nthen those things,\nthey rarely last more than three years and\n\n56\n00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.860\nbeyond that it's just a crap shoot how\nlong it's gonna take before it fails.\n\n57\n00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.020\nThe more you power off and\npower on your computer,\n\n58\n00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.480\nthe sooner those discs are gonna fail,\nthey don't last forever.\n\n59\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.880\nSSDs last a lot longer,\nI mean you might go seven years and\n\n60\n00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.020\nnot have a single failure\non one of those things.\n\n61\n00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.740\nThey really last a long time,\nbut not everybody has SSD yet.\n\n62\n00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.070\nSo those are some examples.\n\n63\n00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.170\nIt could be something a little more crazy,\nmaybe\n\n64\n00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.280\nyou accidentally delete some operating\nsystem files and now you can't boot.\n\n65\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.540\nMaybe you get a virus or malware and your\nsystem's infected and now you can't boot.\n\n66\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.810\nThese are things that might stop you\nfrom being able to use your system, or\n\n67\n00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.030\neven something as innocent as you've\nforgotten your password, right?\n\n68\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.070\nWe'll talk a little bit more\nabout password recovery later on,\n\n69\n00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.260\nbut if you have file vault\nencryption turned on.\n\n70\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.200\nAnd you've got a password,\nand you forget it,\n\n71\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.820\nyou can get completely locked out of your\nsystem and you're unable to get in there.\n\n72\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.540\nWhat do you do in those scenarios?\n\n73\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.510\nAnd that's where OS recovery comes in.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don,\n\n74\n00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.880\nlet's continue on this line of\nthought just really quickly and\n\n75\n00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.400\ncan you give us some kind of idea of some\nof the symptoms we might encounter so\n\n76\n00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.150\nthat we know something is going wrong?\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so for your average end user,\n\n77\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.750\nthey might not even know the difference\nbetween an SSD and HDD, or whatever,\n\n78\n00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.580\nand we don't want them to have to know\nthat, this is supposed to just work.\n\n79\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.604\nSo, they're gonna identify symptoms,\nsymptoms like the computer freezes,\n\n80\n00:04:04.604 --> 00:04:08.880\nit just gets stuck and\nyou have to power off, power back on, or\n\n81\n00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.350\nmaybe a reboots on its own randomly.\n\n82\n00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.360\nMore commonly though, you start seeing\nthat little spinning pin wheel,\n\n83\n00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.940\nthe spinning color wheel, right?\n\n84\n00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.550\nWhen the system is thinking, when it's\nworking hard on something your cursor will\n\n85\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.641\nturn into this little beach ball type.\n&gt;&gt; I call it the rainbow\n\n86\n00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:26.013\npin wheel of doom [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is a very creative\n\n87\n00:04:26.013 --> 00:04:26.577\nname.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n88\n00:04:26.577 --> 00:04:27.297\nI have moments [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're\n\n89\n00:04:27.297 --> 00:04:27.797\ngonna trademark that one.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n90\n00:04:27.797 --> 00:04:30.796\n&gt;&gt; But that usually just means the system\n\n91\n00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:31.760\nis busy.\n\n92\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.910\nBut it could also mean that\nsomething is not working right and\n\n93\n00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.520\nthe system is trying to access that\nthing that's not working right.\n\n94\n00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.920\nAnd it's having to wait, and\nif you are seeing that a lot, more and\n\n95\n00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.890\nmore frequently, that would be a symptom\nyour end-users would recognize.\n\n96\n00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.790\nAnd it could indicate\nan issue with your system.\n\n97\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.570\nThere's other things like\nyou power on the system and\n\n98\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.650\nit tells you it can't find\nthe operating system, right?\n\n99\n00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.070\nYou'll normally see a little globe with a\nnetwork picture because it's going to try\n\n100\n00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.300\nand boot recovery off of\nthe Internet at that point.\n\n101\n00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.720\nYou might see a folder with a question\nmark on it telling you that\n\n102\n00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.510\nit can't find the operating system.\n\n103\n00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.680\nThose are all symptoms that occur and\nlet you know that, one way or\n\n104\n00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.835\nanother, your system is damaged and\nit might be hardware.\n\n105\n00:05:10.835 --> 00:05:15.105\nBut if it's software, there's a couple of\neasy ways that we can fix that that go\n\n106\n00:05:15.105 --> 00:05:17.575\nright along with the Mac OS installer.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Don,\n\n107\n00:05:17.575 --> 00:05:19.395\nwe've determined that yes,\n\n108\n00:05:19.395 --> 00:05:23.315\nwhile most of the time your Apple system\nwill just work sometimes it doesn't.\n\n109\n00:05:23.315 --> 00:05:27.385\nWe've seen some of the symptoms that\nmight indicate that there is a problem.\n\n110\n00:05:27.385 --> 00:05:29.895\nNow let's jump on\nthe train of how can we fix\n\n111\n00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:32.725\nit?\n&gt;&gt; All right, well there's several tools\n\n112\n00:05:32.725 --> 00:05:35.530\navailable to us, and throughout this\nseries we're gonna see all of them.\n\n113\n00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.938\nBut this is a quick kind of overview.\n\n114\n00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:41.556\nMy first go-to tool,\nif I've got a system that's acting weird,\n\n115\n00:05:41.556 --> 00:05:45.535\nif I have a Time Machine back up,\nI will restore the Time Machine back up.\n\n116\n00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:46.505\nThat's the thing to do, right?\n\n117\n00:05:46.505 --> 00:05:49.970\nCuz you can replace every file\nwith copies that are known good.\n\n118\n00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.490\nIf I know that my system was working fine\non Monday and here I am, on Thursday, and\n\n119\n00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.510\nit's not working.\n\n120\n00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.030\nI could restore Monday's backup and\nI should be back up and going.\n\n121\n00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.240\nIf I'm not,\nI likely do have a hardware issue and\n\n122\n00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.480\nI've got a trip to the Apple\nstore ahead of me, right?\n\n123\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.800\nBut if I can restore that Time Machine\nbackup, I'll be back in business,\n\n124\n00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.910\nthat's one of the great\ntools that we've got.\n\n125\n00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.090\nIf I think it's a disk failure\nI can use the Disk Utility.\n\n126\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.350\nDisk Utility has first aid that you\ncan run, that scan across the disk and\n\n127\n00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.440\ntry to repair any failures and\nget you back into your system.\n\n128\n00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.538\nI can reinstall macOS.\n\n129\n00:06:22.538 --> 00:06:25.910\nMaybe the operating system is corrupt but\nthe rest of everything is fine.\n\n130\n00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.460\nI can just reinstall macOS.\n\n131\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.651\nAnd now all my data stays.\n\n132\n00:06:28.651 --> 00:06:31.290\nIt's a non-destructive install by default.\n\n133\n00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.460\nWe talked about that in the last episode,\nand I can fix the OS and\n\n134\n00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.750\nget back in businesses and\nother tools available to me.\n\n135\n00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.530\nThese are all different things that\nare available depending on what it is that\n\n136\n00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.290\nwe're trying to do and there's even\nmore commands that are available.\n\n137\n00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.811\nIf you drop to the terminal there's a ton\nof Unix-based commands that you can use to\n\n138\n00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:49.532\npotentially fix or repair your system.\n\n139\n00:06:49.532 --> 00:06:53.550\nSo Apple gives us a lot of the tools.\n\n140\n00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.920\nWe may not know how to use them,\n\n141\n00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.090\nand when you make that trip down to\nthe Apple store, the Apple store employees\n\n142\n00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.540\ndon't really have access to much more\nthan what you had access to yourself.\n\n143\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.520\nThe difference is they've been through\ntraining to learn how to use it, which is\n\n144\n00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.280\nexactly what we're doing right now,\ngetting a chance to learn how those tools\n\n145\n00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.530\nwork to avoid that trip down to the store.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\n\n146\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.460\nDon, I know that sometimes,\nI've worked in the biz a little bit, and\n\n147\n00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.100\nfrom time to time you get\na machine that you can't boot, or\n\n148\n00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.790\nit's stuck in a boot loop,\nor something like that.\n\n149\n00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.110\nOr you're having trouble actually\ninteracting with the system.\n\n150\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.570\nWhat if that's the case,\nare we still able to use these tools or,\n\n151\n00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.860\nare we just kind of out of luck.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, so that's a good point,\n\n152\n00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.090\nif you can't even boot your system, how\nare you supposed to use the Disk Utility?\n\n153\n00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.370\nHow am I suppose to go in and\n\n154\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.650\nrun disk first aid or\nwhatever if you can't even boot?\n\n155\n00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.160\nWell that's where the recovery\nsubsystem comes in.\n\n156\n00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.380\nThe recovery subsystem is available on\nevery Mac that's been properly installed.\n\n157\n00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.073\nThere are some third party companies\nthat sell refurbished Macs, and\n\n158\n00:07:52.073 --> 00:07:55.843\nif they reinstall sometimes they\ndon't include the recovery system.\n\n159\n00:07:55.843 --> 00:08:00.376\nBut if you bought your Mac from Apple or\nfrom an official Apple re-seller, or\n\n160\n00:08:00.376 --> 00:08:04.632\nif you've installed macOS on it yourself,\nAnd not fidgeted around with\n\n161\n00:08:04.632 --> 00:08:09.200\nthe underlying subsystems,\nthen you'll be able to launch recovery.\n\n162\n00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.760\nNow, recovery is a special set of\ntools that are able to do this stuff,\n\n163\n00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.200\nto be able to run disk utility and so on.\n\n164\n00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.900\nSo it's included, or\nshould be included, on every Mac.\n\n165\n00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.980\nAnd you can access that recovery\nsystem and fix the problem.\n\n166\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.430\nEven if your operating system is damaged,\nit's an ultimate way to be able to boot\n\n167\n00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.570\nand get into that.\n&gt;&gt; So, Don,\n\n168\n00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.600\nis that recovery system basically\nindependent of the main operating system?\n\n169\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.800\nIs that why we're able to access it?\n&gt;&gt; Yes and no.\n\n170\n00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.790\nSo from a software perspective, yes.\n\n171\n00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.910\nThe recovery system is its own\nstandalone operating system.\n\n172\n00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:45.280\nIt does not share any files with your\ninstalled operating system, right?\n\n173\n00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.430\nSo it is completely separate\nfrom that perspective.\n\n174\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:52.092\nAnd the way Apple does that is by putting\nit on a special partition on the disk,\n\n175\n00:08:52.092 --> 00:08:55.484\na hidden partition,\none that you can't normally see.\n\n176\n00:08:55.484 --> 00:08:58.250\nOr if your formatted APFS\nhas a separate volume.\n\n177\n00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.950\nSo it's a separate volume that's hidden\naway that you can't normally see, and\n\n178\n00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.510\nthat's protecting those files.\n\n179\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.160\nIf you get a virus, or malware, or\nyou're accidentally deleting stuff,\n\n180\n00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.690\nit's not gonna be from the recovery\nvolume, cuz you can't see it, right?\n\n181\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.260\nAnd so then when I reboot, I can choose\nto boot from that recovery volume.\n\n182\n00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.410\nAnd now, I’m getting this nice intact\nstripped down operating system, and\n\n183\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.340\nthen I can go in and\nI can repair things, right?\n\n184\n00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.990\nSo from a software side, it’s isolated.\n\n185\n00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.220\nFrom a hardware side, it isn’t, though.\n\n186\n00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.190\nOn a hardware side,\n\n187\n00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:32.030\nthe recovery volume is on the same\nphysical disk as your operating system.\n\n188\n00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.250\nSo what happens if\nthe physical disk fails?\n\n189\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.500\nYou lose the recovery volume, as well.\n\n190\n00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.740\nSo it's separate for every type of\nfailure, except for a hard drive failure.\n\n191\n00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.090\nIf the hard drive fails,\nnow you got a bit of a problem.\n\n192\n00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.250\nNow, there's ways to get around that,\nright?\n\n193\n00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.424\nTechnically, I'm gonna\nimproperly eject this.\n\n194\n00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:55.962\nThe macOS High Sierra install media\nthat we made back in episode one,\n\n195\n00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:59.573\ntechnically, it's the recovery\noperating system.\n\n196\n00:09:59.573 --> 00:10:03.120\nSo I could just boot from an install\nmedia like this and do that.\n\n197\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.270\nMaybe I don't have one of these,\nthough, right?\n\n198\n00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.680\nWell, if you've been using Time Machine,\n\n199\n00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.790\nsomewhere around here I have\nmy Time Machine disk, right?\n\n200\n00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.555\nIt's just an external hard drive,\nI put a sticker on it.\n\n201\n00:10:12.555 --> 00:10:13.321\n&gt;&gt; It says, Time Machine.\n\n202\n00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:15.081\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It says, Time Machine, yep.\n\n203\n00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:18.367\nThat's how I remember.\n&gt;&gt; It's not an actual time machine,\n\n204\n00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:21.951\nit's not gonna take me through time.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I'd go back and\n\n205\n00:10:21.951 --> 00:10:23.545\nplay high school football again.\n\n206\n00:10:23.545 --> 00:10:25.471\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Four points in a single game, baby.\n\n207\n00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:27.149\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if you have your Time Machine disk,\n\n208\n00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:30.300\nif you look at the Time Machine disk,\nyou'll see all your backups.\n\n209\n00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.780\nBut what you don't see is that there's\nactually a recovery partition on this,\n\n210\n00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.638\nas well.\n\n211\n00:10:34.638 --> 00:10:37.695\nApple says, wow, if you have to\nreplace an entire hard drive,\n\n212\n00:10:37.695 --> 00:10:40.875\nyou lose everything,\nyou can have the recovery partition and\n\n213\n00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:43.755\nall your data backed up to this\nexternal disk and restore it from that.\n\n214\n00:10:43.755 --> 00:10:48.645\nSo Apple's giving this to you in as\nmany possible locations as they can.\n\n215\n00:10:48.645 --> 00:10:50.133\n&gt;&gt; You can't say they didn't try, right?\n\n216\n00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:50.661\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n217\n00:10:50.661 --> 00:10:51.334\n[LAUGH] They make the effort.\n\n218\n00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:52.824\nAnd we could go even further, right,\n\n219\n00:10:52.824 --> 00:10:54.744\nbecause there's internet recovery,\nas well.\n\n220\n00:10:54.744 --> 00:10:59.200\nIf you don't have any of the stuff that I\njust talked about, any Mac that was made,\n\n221\n00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.142\nI believe it was starting with 10.11,\nbut it might be 10.12,\n\n222\n00:11:03.142 --> 00:11:05.060\ndefinitely at least 10.12.\n\n223\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.670\nIf your Mac shipped with 10.12 or\nhigher, Sierra or higher,\n\n224\n00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.980\npretty sure this is now Capitan though,\nthen it supports internet recovery.\n\n225\n00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.792\nWhere if your system boots, and\nit has no operating system,\n\n226\n00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:20.785\nit can't find the hard drive, or whatever,\nit'll let you pick a wireless network.\n\n227\n00:11:20.785 --> 00:11:23.157\nAnd then it'll go out and\nphone home to Apple, and\n\n228\n00:11:23.157 --> 00:11:27.015\nit'll download the recovery OS from the\ninternet and throw it into random boot.\n\n229\n00:11:27.015 --> 00:11:29.710\nYou got a ton of ways to do it, right?\n\n230\n00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.001\nBut most of the ways are slow.\n\n231\n00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:35.570\nThe one that's built into your disk,\nthat's the one that's most reliable.\n\n232\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.735\nAnd let me just show you real\nquick here on this system.\n\n233\n00:11:37.735 --> 00:11:42.534\nIf I go into my disk utility,\nI've got my Windows there complaining\n\n234\n00:11:42.534 --> 00:11:46.500\nabout improperly ejecting that device.\n&gt;&gt; It really doesn't like that,\n\n235\n00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.441\nby the way.\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't.\n\n236\n00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:47.991\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:49.251\n&gt;&gt; But if I go into my disk utility,\n\n238\n00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:50.940\nactually, I don't know\nwhere I'm going here.\n\n239\n00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.810\nI'm gonna just use Spotlight\nto get into my disk utility.\n\n240\n00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.400\nWhen you go into the disk utility,\nyou see, oddly enough, your disks.\n\n241\n00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.700\nAnd, as I look at my discs,\nI can see that Macintosh HD.\n\n242\n00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.830\nAnd if you watched the installing episode,\nwe made this database volume, so\n\n243\n00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.820\nI've got this database volume, as well.\n\n244\n00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.740\nBut I'm seeing all that right here.\n\n245\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.809\nAnd I don't see the recovery volume.\n\n246\n00:12:11.809 --> 00:12:13.380\nIt doesn't show up, right?\n\n247\n00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.640\nRemember how I said it's hidden?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n248\n00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.960\n&gt;&gt; It's hidden so you can't mess with\n\n249\n00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.660\nit, right?\n\n250\n00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.370\nIf it was here, I could mount it,\nstart copying files into it, and\n\n251\n00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.480\nnow it's no good to me, right?\n\n252\n00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:27.370\nBut if you drop to your terminal, so\nI'm gonna fire up the terminal real quick.\n\n253\n00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.093\nAnd in the terminal, let me make this\nnot microscopic, inside of the terminal,\n\n254\n00:12:34.093 --> 00:12:39.340\nif you run diskutil list, this is the\ncommand line version of the disk utility.\n\n255\n00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.220\nAnd when I tell it to list, I'm saying\nshow me all the volumes that you know\n\n256\n00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.640\nabout, and it lays that out for me.\n\n257\n00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.280\nNow APFS,\nyou have the physical partition, and\n\n258\n00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.030\nthen you have your volumes inside of it.\n\n259\n00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.970\nAnd so looking at this,\nI see the physical partition here.\n\n260\n00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.970\nI have a 250 gig disk,\nand so that's showing up.\n\n261\n00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.810\nAnd then down here, I see the synthesized\nvolumes, that's the logical volumes.\n\n262\n00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:00.636\nAnd I see Macintosh HD.\n\n263\n00:13:00.636 --> 00:13:04.262\nAnd then I see a bunch that\nwere hidden pre-boot, right,\n\n264\n00:13:04.262 --> 00:13:08.450\nwhich has some of your EFI stuff,\nyour boot files in there.\n\n265\n00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.810\nRecovery, there's the recovery partition.\n\n266\n00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.877\nThe recovery OS is actually\nabout 600 megs in size.\n\n267\n00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:16.456\nI can see this is a 2 gig partition.\n\n268\n00:13:16.456 --> 00:13:20.467\nAnd then a VM partition, right, for\nsome of its virtual memory that it's set\n\n269\n00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:23.196\naside right there, and\nthat one can actually grow.\n\n270\n00:13:23.196 --> 00:13:25.635\nMine's 2.1 gigs, yours could be larger,\n\n271\n00:13:25.635 --> 00:13:28.584\njust depends on how much memory\nyou have in your system.\n\n272\n00:13:28.584 --> 00:13:31.524\nBut I see that one showing up,\nand then after there's database,\n\n273\n00:13:31.524 --> 00:13:33.650\nthat's the one we added in the other show.\n\n274\n00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.970\nBut that recovery partition, it's there.\n\n275\n00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.366\nIt's just hidden, we don't see it.\n\n276\n00:13:38.366 --> 00:13:41.450\nSo as long as it's a software error,\nI'll be able to boot to that and\n\n277\n00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.305\nrecover my system.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Don,\n\n278\n00:13:43.305 --> 00:13:45.975\nyou make a good point talking about\nbooting from the recovery system.\n\n279\n00:13:45.975 --> 00:13:48.793\nWe haven't talked about\nhow we can do that quite\n\n280\n00:13:48.793 --> 00:13:51.741\nyet.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so thinking back to what we've\n\n281\n00:13:51.741 --> 00:13:55.604\ndone in previous episodes,\nif I wanna boot to an alternate location,\n\n282\n00:13:55.604 --> 00:13:59.538\nI normally hold down the Option key\non my keyboard while I boot, right?\n\n283\n00:13:59.538 --> 00:14:04.560\nBut if you hold the Option key while\nyou boot, recovery doesn't show up.\n\n284\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.010\nIf you watched this earlier episode or\nif you go back and rewind,\n\n285\n00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.620\nyou'll see that the recovery\noption is not there.\n\n286\n00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.090\nIf you wanna boot from recovery,\n\n287\n00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:14.010\nyou actually have to use\na different key combination.\n\n288\n00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.710\nYou need to hold Cmd+R on your keyboard.\n\n289\n00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:22.760\nWhen you hold Cmd+R, that tells\nthe system to boot from recovery.\n\n290\n00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.868\nSo you'll hold Cmd+R, you'll hit\nthe power button, you'll hear the gong,\n\n291\n00:14:26.868 --> 00:14:27.864\nthe little [NOISE].\n\n292\n00:14:27.864 --> 00:14:31.244\nAnd then after that,\nit'll start to boot from recovery, and\n\n293\n00:14:31.244 --> 00:14:35.460\nthen you can let go of the Cmd+R and\nlet it finish booting, right?\n\n294\n00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.970\nThat's required to boot from recovery.\n\n295\n00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.460\nIf you're booting from install media or\n\n296\n00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.210\nfrom Time Machine,\nthose you can hold down the Option key.\n\n297\n00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.890\nAnd you hold down the Option key, and\nyou'll see your Time Machine disk.\n\n298\n00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.940\nAnd you can choose it, and\nyou can boot from it, right?\n\n299\n00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.290\nAnd that'll boot recovery off\nof the Time Machine disk.\n\n300\n00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.669\nBut if you wanna boot from\nthe one that's on the drive,\n\n301\n00:14:53.669 --> 00:14:56.177\nwhich is gonna be the fastest one,\nyou have to do Cmd+R.\n\n302\n00:14:56.177 --> 00:14:59.210\nAnd there's actually\na few variations to this.\n\n303\n00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:03.419\nWhen we go into recovery, we will\ntypically, like if my OS is messed up,\n\n304\n00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:05.561\nI'm gonna reinstall my OS, right?\n\n305\n00:15:05.561 --> 00:15:07.780\nThat's typically what we're gonna do.\n\n306\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.930\nWell, when you hold Cmd+R,\n\n307\n00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:14.180\nit's gonna look at the version of\nmacOS that's on your disk right now.\n\n308\n00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.742\nAnd it's gonna try and reinstall that\nsame version, that's what it does.\n\n309\n00:15:18.742 --> 00:15:21.251\nBut there's some other key\ncombinations you can hit.\n\n310\n00:15:21.251 --> 00:15:25.035\nSo for example,\nif you do Shift+Option+Cmd+R,\n\n311\n00:15:25.035 --> 00:15:27.310\nthis is nice way of showing.\n\n312\n00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.711\nIt's like playing Twister on your\n\n313\n00:15:29.711 --> 00:15:31.014\nkeyboard.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n314\n00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:31.769\n[LAUGH] Right hand blue.\n\n315\n00:15:31.769 --> 00:15:33.352\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What are we leaving off there?\n\n316\n00:15:33.352 --> 00:15:34.472\nWe're leaving Ctrl off.\n\n317\n00:15:34.472 --> 00:15:41.070\nSo Cmd+Option+Shift+R,\nif you hold all of those keys down and hit\n\n318\n00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.040\nthe power button, first off, get a friend.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.169\n&gt;&gt; Hit that power button,\n\n320\n00:15:45.169 --> 00:15:48.216\nit's gonna power on and\nyou hear the gong, and then it'll go and\n\n321\n00:15:48.216 --> 00:15:50.005\nit'll boot to recovery.\n\n322\n00:15:50.005 --> 00:15:52.026\nIt'll look exactly the same.\n\n323\n00:15:52.026 --> 00:15:55.325\nBut the difference here is it's\ngonna look at your system, and\n\n324\n00:15:55.325 --> 00:15:58.141\nit's gonna look at the serial\nnumber of your system.\n\n325\n00:15:58.141 --> 00:16:06.534\nAnd it'll say You're system shipped with\nMavericks, or El Capitan, or Sierra.\n\n326\n00:16:06.534 --> 00:16:10.264\nIt'll figure out what version\nof macOS you shipped with.\n\n327\n00:16:10.264 --> 00:16:13.866\nAnd if you reinstall macOS, it'll\nreinstall the original version that you\n\n328\n00:16:13.866 --> 00:16:17.550\nshipped with, that's really cool\nif you have a failed upgrade.\n\n329\n00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.327\nI tried to do the upgrade and\nI hosed something up,\n\n330\n00:16:20.327 --> 00:16:23.578\nI just need to downgrade now,\nthat's a quick way to do it.\n\n331\n00:16:23.578 --> 00:16:26.280\nYou boot your recovery with\ncommand option shift R, and\n\n332\n00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.520\nthen it re-installs that previous version,\nalright.\n\n333\n00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.837\nThere's another combination, which is if\nyou boot holding just option command R.\n\n334\n00:16:34.837 --> 00:16:39.349\nOption command R will say install\nthe newest version of macOS that's\n\n335\n00:16:39.349 --> 00:16:41.770\nsupported by this hardware.\n\n336\n00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.253\nNow both of these options requiree\nInternet connection cuz they have to get\n\n337\n00:16:45.253 --> 00:16:47.142\nthat operating system from somewhere.\n\n338\n00:16:47.142 --> 00:16:51.377\nSo if I boot with option command R and\nmaybe I'm running Sierra and\n\n339\n00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:55.340\nI told to reinstall macOS is\ngonna install High Sierra.\n\n340\n00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.950\nIt'll do the newest one, so\nway to kinda force and upgrade.\n\n341\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.211\nIf you can't remember any of those,\nno big deal, command R,\n\n342\n00:17:01.211 --> 00:17:02.800\nthat's the one to remember.\n\n343\n00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.644\nCommand R will boot you into recovery, and\nallow you to reinstall the current OS.\n\n344\n00:17:05.644 --> 00:17:10.010\nAnd that's what most of us want\nto do as a general rule of thumb.\n\n345\n00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:14.863\nSo on this system, if I wanna shut it down\nI'll just take it, and we'll shut it down.\n\n346\n00:17:14.863 --> 00:17:17.115\nI'm gonna wait for it to power off.\n\n347\n00:17:17.115 --> 00:17:19.630\nSo I've got to watch the lights\non the front of it and\n\n348\n00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.102\nmake sure it actually go off.\n\n349\n00:17:21.102 --> 00:17:25.756\nAnd then, I'll power on while holding\ncommand R to get to that recovery\n\n350\n00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:28.250\nscreen to be able to boot that system.\n\n351\n00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.193\nAnd so, that's right, and Daniel if you\ncan tell me when that light goes off.\n\n352\n00:17:30.193 --> 00:17:31.444\n&gt;&gt; The light just went off.\n\n353\n00:17:31.444 --> 00:17:32.460\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Perfect time.\n\n354\n00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.867\n&gt;&gt; So I'm just gonna hold command R on my\n\n355\n00:17:34.867 --> 00:17:38.370\nkeyboard and,\nI mentioned this in the last episode.\n\n356\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.930\nIf you are on a USB keyboard or\nan official Apple wireless keyboard,\n\n357\n00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.371\nthen you just hold command R and\nyou hit power.\n\n358\n00:17:44.371 --> 00:17:47.230\nIf you are on a third\nparty wireless keyboard,\n\n359\n00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.330\nyou may need to get a USB\nkeyboard to do this.\n\n360\n00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.507\nBut I'm gonna hold Cmd+R,\nI'm gonna push that power button and\n\n361\n00:17:53.507 --> 00:17:55.081\nthat machine's gonna fire up.\n\n362\n00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:58.315\nIt's gonna tell,\nit'll know that I'm holding Cmd+R and\n\n363\n00:17:58.315 --> 00:18:03.650\nit'll say, I shouldn't boot from the\ninternal disk I should boot from recovery.\n\n364\n00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.528\nNow it's not gonna look too different for\nme right off the bat, I see the Apple.\n\n365\n00:18:07.528 --> 00:18:09.589\nI'm gonna see the little bar going across.\n\n366\n00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:13.270\nI can let go of Cmd+R at this point,\nso I'm letting go.\n\n367\n00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.150\nAnd now it's booting\nfrom that hidden volume,\n\n368\n00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.456\nthat recovery volume that was there.\n\n369\n00:18:18.456 --> 00:18:20.362\nIf I had File Vault turned on,\n\n370\n00:18:20.362 --> 00:18:24.400\nit would have actually made\nme unlock File Vault first.\n\n371\n00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.269\nAnd then, because even the recovery\nvolume gets encrypted but\n\n372\n00:18:28.269 --> 00:18:30.902\nthen it lets you go in and\ndo the reinstall.\n\n373\n00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:35.790\nSo at this point though it's firing\nup it does take a little bit\n\n374\n00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:41.070\nlonger to boot than the normal OS and\nthere's a few reasons for it.\n\n375\n00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:45.312\nBut the main reason is this loading less\ndrivers and when you boot macOS normally,\n\n376\n00:18:45.312 --> 00:18:48.890\nis actually a lot of work that it\ndoes at boot than it's kind of cache.\n\n377\n00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.910\nIt's kind of like the old\nhibernated mode in laptops.\n\n378\n00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.068\nIt actually does that with the OS,\nboot just normal features now.\n\n379\n00:18:55.068 --> 00:18:59.844\nSo normally it boots pretty fast, but\nhere in recovery it doesn't want to use\n\n380\n00:18:59.844 --> 00:19:03.510\nany of that cached data,\nbecause it's not reliable.\n\n381\n00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.245\nSo it's having to do\neverything from scratch and\n\n382\n00:19:05.245 --> 00:19:06.651\nthat takes it just a little bit longer.\n\n383\n00:19:06.651 --> 00:19:10.639\nThe bar just resets, that tell's me\nit's almost done and then there we go.\n\n384\n00:19:10.639 --> 00:19:12.595\nNow I'm booting, I'm in recovery.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome,\n\n385\n00:19:12.595 --> 00:19:15.860\nDon is it always been this way for\ngetting to the recovery?\n\n386\n00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.417\nI've got an Apple to eat.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n387\n00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:18.300\n&gt;&gt; They're totally useless.\n\n388\n00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.461\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n389\n00:19:19.461 --> 00:19:20.825\n&gt;&gt; You know it wasn't always this way,\n\n390\n00:19:20.825 --> 00:19:21.894\nthis is super convenient.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n391\n00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:23.441\n&gt;&gt; Because I know almost any Mac and\n\n392\n00:19:23.441 --> 00:19:27.220\nno matter what problem it's having I can\nhold command R when I boot unless it's\n\n393\n00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.580\na fail hard drive and\nI'll be able to get to this.\n\n394\n00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.540\nIf it was a fail hard drive,\nI can do Internet recovery and\n\n395\n00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.155\nyou'll be in business there.\n\n396\n00:19:34.155 --> 00:19:38.478\nIn mountain lion in older and\nthe older OS 10 operating systems they\n\n397\n00:19:38.478 --> 00:19:42.030\nhad what was called\nthe recovery disk assistant.\n\n398\n00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.228\nYou go to Apple's website,\non a different computer and\n\n399\n00:19:44.228 --> 00:19:46.205\nyou would download\nthe recovery disk assistant.\n\n400\n00:19:46.205 --> 00:19:48.990\nIt's a little program,\nand you would run it.\n\n401\n00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:54.169\nAnd it would help you make a special USB\nkey that was just for recovery right.\n\n402\n00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:57.830\nAnd then you would take that and\nyou would go and recover the system.\n\n403\n00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.234\nSo if you're dealing with an older\nmac you might need that, all right.\n\n404\n00:20:01.234 --> 00:20:04.632\nBut the built in recovery and\nInternet recovery they've been around for\n\n405\n00:20:04.632 --> 00:20:06.000\nseveral versions now.\n\n406\n00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.871\nSo all of your newer\nmacs should have that and\n\n407\n00:20:07.871 --> 00:20:10.107\nthe ones you've upgraded\nshould have that as well.\n\n408\n00:20:10.107 --> 00:20:13.930\nIt's just if you're one of those members\nwhere you have to support an older mac.\n\n409\n00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:15.892\nYou may need to get\nthe recovery disk assistance,\n\n410\n00:20:15.892 --> 00:20:17.632\nit's free it's on apple support website.\n\n411\n00:20:17.632 --> 00:20:21.260\nI'll put the link in the show notes so\nthat you can click on it and go.\n\n412\n00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.820\nBut once you got that, you reach out and\nbuild your recovery media and\n\n413\n00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.446\nnow you are in business.\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, it looks like we are right\n\n414\n00:20:26.446 --> 00:20:30.210\nthere at the point where you might have to\ndo start clicking some options here and\n\n415\n00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.800\nwe could actually do a recovery.\n\n416\n00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.989\nWould you be able to show us that process?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n417\n00:20:33.989 --> 00:20:36.454\nSo, let's say my OS was damaged, right?\n\n418\n00:20:36.454 --> 00:20:39.230\nIt's damaged and\nI wanna get in here and recover.\n\n419\n00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.444\nSo I've got my four\nlittle menu options and\n\n420\n00:20:41.444 --> 00:20:44.162\nwe saw the use in\nthe installation episode, right.\n\n421\n00:20:44.162 --> 00:20:49.760\nWhen I was installing macOS, I just\nchoose to, well, install macOS, right.\n\n422\n00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.967\nAnd that's exactly what I would do here.\n\n423\n00:20:51.967 --> 00:20:55.255\nIf I thought that I had some\ndamage files on the hardrive,\n\n424\n00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:59.380\nI could go to the Disk Utility and\nthen hit first aid button up at the top.\n\n425\n00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.313\nAnd it will scan disk, look for\nerrors, and try to fix them.\n\n426\n00:21:02.313 --> 00:21:05.672\nIf permissions are messed up I can\nlaunch the disk utility, hit first aid,\n\n427\n00:21:05.672 --> 00:21:07.323\nsame pool, and it will go through and\n\n428\n00:21:07.323 --> 00:21:10.128\nit will fix the permissions,\nthat's a great way to fix that.\n\n429\n00:21:10.128 --> 00:21:13.449\nIf I wanna restore from time machine,\nI click the restore from time machine.\n\n430\n00:21:13.449 --> 00:21:16.129\nAnd then I make sure I have my\ntime machine drive hooked up, and\n\n431\n00:21:16.129 --> 00:21:17.650\nwe can restore there.\n\n432\n00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.955\nBut if we're just trying to fix\nthe operating system, right.\n\n433\n00:21:19.955 --> 00:21:25.415\nAll we would do is choose reinstall,\nand it's no different then what we'd go\n\n434\n00:21:25.415 --> 00:21:31.100\nthrough when we're just trying to\ninstall macOS for the first time, right?\n\n435\n00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.583\nThat we choose Reinstall macOS and\nthen we walk through that wizard.\n\n436\n00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:37.526\nIt asks us to sign off on their agreements\nand all that other good stuff, and\n\n437\n00:21:37.526 --> 00:21:38.225\nthat's it.\n\n438\n00:21:38.225 --> 00:21:40.830\nSo really not any different\nthan we'd normally do.\n\n439\n00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.906\nAnd apparently I'm having\na hard time hitting\n\n440\n00:21:42.906 --> 00:21:43.493\nContinue.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n441\n00:21:43.493 --> 00:21:44.747\n&gt;&gt; But we saw that process,\n\n442\n00:21:44.747 --> 00:21:48.510\nthis is where we would be picking up in,\nwhat was our previous episode, and\n\n443\n00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.445\nactually doing that install.\n\n444\n00:21:50.445 --> 00:21:53.277\nIf you go into Disk Utility,\nlet me just fire that up real quick.\n\n445\n00:21:53.277 --> 00:21:59.175\nInside of Disk Utility,\nit's this first aid option, first aid.\n\n446\n00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.065\nSorry, that is right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, first aid.\n\n447\n00:22:01.065 --> 00:22:01.668\n&gt;&gt; I confused my head.\n\n448\n00:22:01.668 --> 00:22:02.783\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n449\n00:22:02.783 --> 00:22:03.665\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking like Rambo First Blood.\n\n450\n00:22:03.665 --> 00:22:06.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes, which is amazing.\n\n451\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:10.274\nThey drew first blood not us.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So the first aid button here,\n\n452\n00:22:10.274 --> 00:22:11.638\nyou just hit it.\n\n453\n00:22:11.638 --> 00:22:14.211\nIt fixes disk errors,\nas well as permissions, so we've got that.\n\n454\n00:22:14.211 --> 00:22:15.779\nIt also lets you see your hard drive.\n\n455\n00:22:15.779 --> 00:22:17.486\nSo you can tell like, hey,\n\n456\n00:22:17.486 --> 00:22:22.389\nif your hard drive doesn't even show up\nhere then maybe the cable came off, but\n\n457\n00:22:22.389 --> 00:22:24.317\nodds are it's totally dead.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n458\n00:22:24.317 --> 00:22:25.234\n&gt;&gt; You need to replace that disk.\n\n459\n00:22:25.234 --> 00:22:28.750\nSo just another way of\nkinda troubleshooting.\n\n460\n00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.922\nWe're gonna do a series of episodes\nlater on system troubleshooting.\n\n461\n00:22:30.922 --> 00:22:34.236\nNowI'll walk you through a number of other\ntools that we're gonna actually verify\n\n462\n00:22:34.236 --> 00:22:35.840\nwhat the real problem is.\n\n463\n00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.371\nBut for most systems the problem\nis simply software and\n\n464\n00:22:38.371 --> 00:22:41.507\nyou can just choose to just reinstall\nmacOS and you'll be back up and\n\n465\n00:22:41.507 --> 00:22:43.320\nrunning before you know it.\n&gt;&gt; Alright,\n\n466\n00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.530\nwell Don, that's a really good\nlook into the recovery process.\n\n467\n00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.342\nObviously, ladies and\ngentlemen it's not that difficult.\n\n468\n00:22:48.342 --> 00:22:52.211\nApple does a very good job trying to make\nit as easy as possible for us as the end\n\n469\n00:22:52.211 --> 00:22:56.510\nuser or as the support professional to get\nsomeone's computer back up and running.\n\n470\n00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.690\nThey don't want a bunch of\nbroken Apples out there and\n\n471\n00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.002\nno one able to fix them, right.\n\n472\n00:23:00.002 --> 00:23:03.310\nSo they try to make that easy enough I\nthink that they did a really good job.\n\n473\n00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.387\nSpeaking of good jobs Don you did\na fantastic job of exploring that with us\n\n474\n00:23:06.387 --> 00:23:08.969\nand explaining to us all\nthe options that we have available.\n\n475\n00:23:08.969 --> 00:23:11.790\nAnything you wanna add to\nthe show before we call it a day?\n\n476\n00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.550\n&gt;&gt; Main thing I recommend is that if\n\n477\n00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:18.509\nyou're working professionally in an Apple\nenvironment and you're supporting multiple\n\n478\n00:23:18.509 --> 00:23:22.372\nApple devices, it is a great idea\nto always have an installation USB.\n\n479\n00:23:22.372 --> 00:23:26.020\nEven if you're doing net installs and\nother things that,\n\n480\n00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.562\nthis is such a handy troubleshooting\ntool that I know I can boot off this at\n\n481\n00:23:30.562 --> 00:23:32.810\nany time from any machine.\n\n482\n00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:36.049\nAnd have access to terminal, disk utility,\nand a handful of other things,\n\n483\n00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:37.022\nreally really handy.\n\n484\n00:23:37.022 --> 00:23:41.966\nSo definitely make one of these,\ndoesn't cost you any money, except for\n\n485\n00:23:41.966 --> 00:23:46.807\n$15 USB drive, it's an indispensible tool.\n&gt;&gt; Important safety tip ladies and\n\n486\n00:23:46.807 --> 00:23:49.109\ngentlemen, so get your drives out and\nmake one of those things.\n\n487\n00:23:49.109 --> 00:23:50.860\nDon, thanks so much for joining us today.\n\n488\n00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.103\nWe always appreciate your dropping by.\n\n489\n00:23:52.103 --> 00:23:54.420\nAnd then we appreciate your\ndropping by as well but\n\n490\n00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.300\nit looks like we are at that portion of\nour proceeding which is to say goodbye.\n\n491\n00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.650\nSigning off for ITPRO TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n492\n00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:01.990\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:28.077\n&gt;&gt; The person helping\n\n11\n00:00:28.077 --> 00:00:30.220\nus out with that is the one and\nonly Don Pezet.\n\n12\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.440\nDon, good to see you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, great to be back, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.920\nAnd yeah, like you said, many things are\ndesigned to go together like chocolate and\n\n14\n00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.900\npeanut butter, and initially\nconfiguring macOS after you install it.\n\n15\n00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.093\nIf you've been watching\nour episodes in order,\n\n16\n00:00:42.093 --> 00:00:44.293\nyou know in the last\nepisode we installed macOS.\n\n17\n00:00:44.293 --> 00:00:46.479\nWe went through\nthe installation process and\n\n18\n00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.215\nwe kind of ended the show with a little\nstatus bar crawling across the screen,\n\n19\n00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:53.280\nwhich takes roughly 20 minutes,\ndepending on your system.\n\n20\n00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.170\nSo what we're doing here in this episode\nis picking right back up with that, and\n\n21\n00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.350\nsaying, hey, once it's installed,\nwhat do we do with it?\n\n22\n00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.790\nHow do we get our system set up,\nand do the initial configuration?\n\n23\n00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.570\nAnd I'm framing this in the sense of, we\njust installed macOS, but even if you just\n\n24\n00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.080\nbought a brand-new one, if I ran down\nto Best Buy or the Apple Store or\n\n25\n00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.460\nwhatever and bought a MacBook and\nbrought it home and turned it on.\n\n26\n00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.710\nWe would be at the same exact point\nthat we're at here with our install.\n\n27\n00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.880\nAnd, there's a number of things that we\nneed to get set up right on day one just\n\n28\n00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.480\nto get our Mac to where we are able to use\nit and have it perform correctly for us.\n\n29\n00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.240\nAnd those are the things we're going to\nbe covering right here in this episode.\n\n30\n00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.850\n&gt;&gt; So Don, what are the main things that\n\n31\n00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.360\nwe need to configure?\n\n32\n00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.150\nAll right, so Apple kind of breaks\nthis stuff into a couple of\n\n33\n00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.130\nbasic steps that everybody\nkind of needs to follow.\n\n34\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.410\nThere's stuff that's common sense,\nlike if I expect to be able to talk on\n\n35\n00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.890\nthe network,\nI'm gonna need to have my network set up.\n\n36\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.820\nAnd Apple does a really good job of\ntrying to put default settings on that\n\n37\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.870\nwill work for most people.\n\n38\n00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.470\nSo if you're in the 90% group,\nthen you may not have to configure it.\n\n39\n00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.560\nIt just works when you turn it on.\n\n40\n00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.690\nBut if you're in that 10%\ngroup where it doesn't work,\n\n41\n00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.150\nwe need to know those steps to\nget in there and set it up.\n\n42\n00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.140\nSo basically the steps\nthat Apple identifies,\n\n43\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.450\nfirst, we need to think about\nmigrating our data, right?\n\n44\n00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.760\nAnd I'm assigning a number to these.\n\n45\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.910\nThey're not necessarily in order.\n\n46\n00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.870\nThese are just kind of\nthe things that need to be done.\n\n47\n00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.810\nIf I'm replacing an old\ncomputer with a new computer,\n\n48\n00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.550\nI need to get my data from that old\nsystem over to the new system, right,\n\n49\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.140\nso I've gotta figure out how to do that.\n\n50\n00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.510\nIf I did an upgrade on my existing\nmachine, so maybe I was running\n\n51\n00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.580\nEl Capitan and I upgraded to High Sierra,\nwell, it's an upgrade.\n\n52\n00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.920\nIt's in place,\nall of my data is already there.\n\n53\n00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.340\nBut if I'm replacing an old\ncomputer with a new one,\n\n54\n00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.423\nI need to migrate that data,\nget it moved over.\n\n55\n00:02:38.423 --> 00:02:42.050\nI need to configure networking,\nI need to configure user accounts.\n\n56\n00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.300\nIf there is more than one user that's\ngonna be making use of that computer,\n\n57\n00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.756\nI need to set up separate accounts.\n\n58\n00:02:46.756 --> 00:02:49.640\nOr I say need,\nI need to evaluate whether I need that,\n\n59\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.220\nbecause maybe it's fine to\njust share one account.\n\n60\n00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.800\nMany people do that in a home or\nfamily environment.\n\n61\n00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.130\nBut in a work environment,\nit's much, much less common.\n\n62\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.660\nWe need to adjust our general\nsoftware settings, right?\n\n63\n00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.530\nThere's preferences for\na number of different programs.\n\n64\n00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.100\nI know I have some personal tweaks\nI like to make to Finder and\n\n65\n00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.360\na few other programs to get it to\nwork the way that I'm used to.\n\n66\n00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.740\nYou may have personal\npreferences like those also and\n\n67\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.340\nyou wanna go in and set those.\n\n68\n00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.100\nAnd then lastly, we need to make sure\nthat we set our system up to do updates.\n\n69\n00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.580\nSoftware updates are really important.\n\n70\n00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.450\nThey're free, they don't cost you a dime.\n\n71\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.200\nSo no reason not to do them.\n\n72\n00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.430\nAnd whenever there's a virus or ransomware\nor whatever that comes out from macOS,\n\n73\n00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.678\nApple pushes out a fix for\nthat very, very quickly.\n\n74\n00:03:33.678 --> 00:03:37.680\nAnd if you're set for automatic updates,\nit'll update and you won't have a problem.\n\n75\n00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.520\nAll the people out there where you\nhear them saying, I run a Mac,\n\n76\n00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.800\nI don't get viruses.\n\n77\n00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.460\nThat's only true if you do updates.\n\n78\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.700\nIf you don't do updates,\n\n79\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.370\nyour Mac is just as vulnerable as\nany other machine that's out there.\n\n80\n00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.810\nSo really, really critical.\n\n81\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.250\nSo those five things, not necessarily in\nthat order, but those five things are what\n\n82\n00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.390\nwe really need to get set up on a new Mac.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, do we have to hunt around\n\n83\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.860\nto find all of these settings?\n&gt;&gt; Well, it depends.\n\n84\n00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.750\nMostly no, right?\n\n85\n00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.590\nSome of them, I mentioned how I\nhave some personal tweaks and\n\n86\n00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.046\npreferences that I like to do.\n\n87\n00:04:08.046 --> 00:04:10.480\nThose I might have to roam\naround a bit for, right?\n\n88\n00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.940\nBut most of what I just said is all\ncovered by the initial start up wizard.\n\n89\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.570\nWhen you fire up a new Mac,\nit runs through the initial configuration.\n\n90\n00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.010\nAnd Apple already knows\nthe things that you need and\n\n91\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.800\na few things that are kind of optional.\n\n92\n00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.920\nAnd they're gonna present those in an easy\nlittle wizard that you step through.\n\n93\n00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.340\nAll right, now if somebody's\nalready done it for you and\n\n94\n00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.460\nnow you're getting a Mac that's\nalready set up, well, yeah,\n\n95\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.570\nyou might have to hunt around\nto find some of these settings.\n\n96\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.336\nSo we'll talk about how to do that.\n\n97\n00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:39.500\nIt's not that bad.\n\n98\n00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.420\nApple makes stuff really easy to find.\n\n99\n00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.620\nBut basically when you fire up a new Mac,\nI've got a virtual machine here,\n\n100\n00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.766\nthat's pulled up on my screen,\nthat's at that point.\n\n101\n00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:51.714\nWhen your install finishes,\nyour system reboots, and\n\n102\n00:04:51.714 --> 00:04:54.090\nyou're brought to this screen.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n103\n00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.790\n&gt;&gt; If you buy a brand new Mac,\n\n104\n00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.740\nyou push a power button, it turns on and\nyou're brought to this screen.\n\n105\n00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.120\nThis is the initial configuration screen,\nand it welcomes you, right?\n\n106\n00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.817\nHey, welcome to your Mac.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:05:05.817 --> 00:05:06.740\n&gt;&gt; That's nice, but\n\n108\n00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.817\nit also asks you what\ncountry you're in and\n\n109\n00:05:08.817 --> 00:05:12.020\nthat way it can figure out how\nto localize the install for you.\n\n110\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.560\nHow it can make sure that things\nare written in the right language,\n\n111\n00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.200\nthat currency is represented\nthe right way and so on.\n\n112\n00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.750\nThis little wizard, it's not very long.\n\n113\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.260\nI think like eight pages, and\n\n114\n00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.530\nas we go through it's gonna ask\nus questions that help us to\n\n115\n00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.810\ntake care of the five things that I\nmentioned at the beginning of the episode.\n\n116\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.670\nSo it's all right here in one place,\n\n117\n00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.140\none stop shop.\n&gt;&gt; So what if we're already set up?\n\n118\n00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.730\nCan we run the wizard later on?\n\n119\n00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.980\nThere is one way to do it but\nits not officially supported by Apple.\n\n120\n00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.950\nThe idea is that this\nruns when the machine is\n\n121\n00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.654\ninitially set up.\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n122\n00:05:43.654 --> 00:05:45.398\n&gt;&gt; So they did not make it very,\n\n123\n00:05:45.398 --> 00:05:46.568\nvery easy to do it.\n\n124\n00:05:46.568 --> 00:05:50.233\nAnd in fact, if you use the one\nunsupported method, it forces to rerun,\n\n125\n00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:54.730\nand it actually messes with permissions on\nthe disk and it can cause some problems.\n\n126\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.280\nSo we typically don't wanna get it.\n\n127\n00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.050\nYou get this one shot and if there's\nsomething you wanna change later on,\n\n128\n00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.740\nit's not that big of a deal.\n\n129\n00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.070\nYou just have to go and\nfind the preference.\n\n130\n00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.787\nWe'll see how afterwards.\n\n131\n00:06:03.787 --> 00:06:06.110\nAll right, but for right now, let's go\nahead and step through this Wizard,\n\n132\n00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.646\nand you'll see,\n\n133\n00:06:06.646 --> 00:06:08.490\nthere's not really all that much to it.\n&gt;&gt; First thing,\n\n134\n00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.030\nit's gonna ask me my country.\n\n135\n00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.792\nIt's defaulting the United States.\n\n136\n00:06:11.792 --> 00:06:13.233\n&gt;&gt; Bolivia.\n&gt;&gt; We could go\n\n137\n00:06:13.233 --> 00:06:14.155\nBolivia.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n138\n00:06:14.155 --> 00:06:16.230\n&gt;&gt; They speak Spanish in Bolivia?\n\n139\n00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.590\n&gt;&gt; They speak Bolivian, I'm guessing.\n\n140\n00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.309\n&gt;&gt; All right, so honestly,\n\n141\n00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:20.721\nit doesn't matter.\n\n142\n00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:22.713\nI don't know either language so\n\n143\n00:06:22.713 --> 00:06:24.920\nI'll stick with the US.\n&gt;&gt; All right\n\n144\n00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.211\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna ask me about\n\n145\n00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:27.700\nmy keyboard, right?\n\n146\n00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.006\nAnd again just making sure that it knows\nthe layout of the keyboard because\n\n147\n00:06:32.006 --> 00:06:35.347\na French keyboard has different\nkeys than a US keyboard.\n\n148\n00:06:35.347 --> 00:06:37.140\nNot different keys they\nare just in different places.\n\n149\n00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.860\n&gt;&gt; Different places,\n\n150\n00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.700\nright.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we'll pick that.\n\n151\n00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.620\nAnd then here it's gonna\nask me if I wanna transfer\n\n152\n00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.410\ninformation from my previous machine,\nright?\n\n153\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.570\nIf I'm doing an in place upgrade,\nI don't need to transfer anything.\n\n154\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.680\nBut if I'm bringing data\nover from an old Mac or\n\n155\n00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.330\nfrom a Windows machine, I can bring those\nright over and it'll import that data and\n\n156\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.660\nget it transferred,\nall part of this initial setup.\n\n157\n00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.910\nNow I don't actually have\nan old machine right now.\n\n158\n00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.380\nSo I'm just gonna say don't\ntransfer any information.\n\n159\n00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.681\nNext it's gonna ask about iCloud or\nApple ID, right?\n\n160\n00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:11.200\nSo if we wanna sign in with our Apple ID.\n\n161\n00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.610\nNow this is an optional component.\n\n162\n00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.130\nYou don't have to do it.\n\n163\n00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.440\nBut Apple encourages you to use\nApple ID because it's gonna set up\n\n164\n00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.460\nwhere you can do iCloud sync, so\nyour documents get backed up to the cloud,\n\n165\n00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.680\nwhere you also can use iCloud to do\npassword recovery on your system and\n\n166\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.450\npassword recovery for FileVault.\n\n167\n00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.910\nSo there's a number of benefits\nin having iCloud set up.\n\n168\n00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.420\nSome people don't like it, mostly because\nof privacy concerns and other things.\n\n169\n00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.763\nYou don't have to have it.\n\n170\n00:07:35.763 --> 00:07:37.343\nAnd in fact,\nI'm gonna choose don't sign in,\n\n171\n00:07:37.343 --> 00:07:39.510\nwhich is the same thing as\nsaying I'm gonna skip it now.\n\n172\n00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.040\nWhen I do that,\nit is going to give me a little\n\n173\n00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.548\nsecond chance that will pop\nup here in just a second.\n\n174\n00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:46.858\nActually, it didn't do it.\n\n175\n00:07:46.858 --> 00:07:49.602\n[LAUGH] A lot of times it'll\ngive us a second chance saying,\n\n176\n00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:51.904\nare you sure you don't\nwant to sign into iCloud?\n\n177\n00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.610\nIt knows you.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, apparently it's used to me.\n\n178\n00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.214\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n179\n00:07:54.214 --> 00:07:55.512\nit does.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n180\n00:07:55.512 --> 00:07:56.840\nnext is our license agreement.\n\n181\n00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.721\nWe don't have a whole lot of options here.\n\n182\n00:07:58.721 --> 00:08:00.235\nYou can sit here and\nread the legal agreement.\n\n183\n00:08:00.235 --> 00:08:04.851\nBut if you don't agree, then you\ncan't finish, so we'll agree to that.\n\n184\n00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:07.953\nAll right, now, this is probably one of\nthe most important screens of this initial\n\n185\n00:08:07.953 --> 00:08:09.480\nconfiguration wizard.\n\n186\n00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.400\nIt is gonna ask us to\ncreate a user account.\n\n187\n00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.000\nIf we were doing an upgrade,\nit would already have a user account,\n\n188\n00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.485\nI wouldn't see this screen.\n\n189\n00:08:17.485 --> 00:08:19.245\nBut because this is a fresh install or\n\n190\n00:08:19.245 --> 00:08:22.265\na new computer,\nit needs to create a user account.\n\n191\n00:08:22.265 --> 00:08:25.735\nAnd this user account will\nbe an administrator, right?\n\n192\n00:08:25.735 --> 00:08:28.055\nThis first account is\nalways an administrator.\n\n193\n00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:31.985\nWe can create other accounts later that\nare not administrators, but this one is.\n\n194\n00:08:31.985 --> 00:08:34.505\nSo I need to think about who's gonna\nbe the administrator on this system.\n\n195\n00:08:34.505 --> 00:08:36.810\nAnd in this case, I'll just make it me.\n\n196\n00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:40.143\nAnd it's gonna create the full\nname that we recognize, but\n\n197\n00:08:40.143 --> 00:08:43.887\nalso the account name,\nwhich is what Unix uses in the background.\n\n198\n00:08:43.887 --> 00:08:48.498\nAnd then I can define a password,\nand you can provide a hint.\n\n199\n00:08:48.498 --> 00:08:51.260\nThe hint is nice if you\nforget your password.\n\n200\n00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.090\nIt'll display a hint on screen.\n\n201\n00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.320\nBut for an administrator account, we don't\nnormally want to give anybody a hint,\n\n202\n00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.670\nit helps them to guess what\nyour password might be, so\n\n203\n00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.818\nI'm gonna leave it blank.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n204\n00:08:59.818 --> 00:09:01.774\n&gt;&gt; And you can pick that pretty little\n\n205\n00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:02.989\npicture if you want,\n\n206\n00:09:02.989 --> 00:09:05.580\nI've got zen right now apparently.\n&gt;&gt; Yin and\n\n207\n00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.645\nyang.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n208\n00:09:06.645 --> 00:09:09.010\nyou got all sorts of\nthings to choose from.\n\n209\n00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.240\nYeah we'll go e equals m c squared.\n\n210\n00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.180\nOr I'll try to,\nall right well, there we go.\n\n211\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.360\n[LAUGH] I was about to say, this is\nsupposed to be easy, you click on it.\n\n212\n00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:17.923\nSo there we go, so\n\n213\n00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:20.822\nnow it's got enough information to create\nthat administrator account, I'll continue.\n\n214\n00:09:20.822 --> 00:09:23.574\nAnd you'll see a little blurb down here\nat the bottom left where it says it's\n\n215\n00:09:23.574 --> 00:09:24.870\ncreating the account.\n\n216\n00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.310\nAnd so we just give it\na moment while it does that.\n\n217\n00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.730\nNow it's assigning permissions, not just\nto the account, but to a couple of folders\n\n218\n00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.220\nand other areas on the disk to make\nsure that user has the access they need.\n\n219\n00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.340\nOnce it's done,\nit's then gonna move into Express Set Up.\n\n220\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.998\nNow Express Set Up,\nyou could just hit Continue.\n\n221\n00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:44.540\nAnd in fact, a lot of people don't\nrealize there's even another option here.\n\n222\n00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:50.230\nIt's telling us that it's going to enable\nlocation services, and that it's going to\n\n223\n00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.010\nenable reporting information about\nyour system use back to Apple.\n\n224\n00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.800\nAll right, now there's a couple of reasons\nfor these features, location services.\n\n225\n00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.884\nIt needs that if you're using Find My Mac,\nright,\n\n226\n00:10:01.884 --> 00:10:05.483\nhow's it supposed to find it if it doesn't\nknow where it is, needs location services?\n\n227\n00:10:05.483 --> 00:10:09.024\nIf you use the weather widget\nin the dashboard or launch pad,\n\n228\n00:10:09.024 --> 00:10:12.140\nthen how does it know\nwhose weather to show you?\n\n229\n00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.940\nIt needs the location, so\nthat's why it wants to turn that one on.\n\n230\n00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.104\nThe usage information,\nit wants that for a few reasons.\n\n231\n00:10:19.104 --> 00:10:22.644\nOne is if you have a crash or an error,\nit wants to do error reporting and\n\n232\n00:10:22.644 --> 00:10:26.440\nsend that back to Apple or send it\nback to whoever developed the apps.\n\n233\n00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.550\nIf you read, it's all really small,\nbut if you read it says\n\n234\n00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.940\nwe can share crash data with\ndevelopers to improve their apps.\n\n235\n00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.600\nThat's a good thing, right?\n\n236\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.023\nBut it also shares with Apple things like\nwhich applications you have installed.\n\n237\n00:10:38.023 --> 00:10:42.396\nAnd they can use that to gauge which\napps are popular, which are unpopular,\n\n238\n00:10:42.396 --> 00:10:43.430\nand so on.\n\n239\n00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.520\nYou might not be comfortable\nsharing that information.\n\n240\n00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.216\nWell, you don't have to\nshare the information.\n\n241\n00:10:48.216 --> 00:10:50.170\nYou got this nice big continue button, but\n\n242\n00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.640\nright above it you've\ngot Customize Settings.\n\n243\n00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.070\nAnd if you hit that,\nnow you get the option to turn on or\n\n244\n00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.460\noff location services.\n\n245\n00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.340\nI'm gonna leave mine off.\n\n246\n00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.120\nI'm in a virtual machine, so it's not\nlike I have a GPS or anything anyway.\n\n247\n00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.315\nIt's not gonna be able to locate,\nand then well,\n\n248\n00:11:06.315 --> 00:11:11.150\nit's gonna make sure that I know that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so then, it's gonna ask me\n\n249\n00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.460\nthe rest of the information here,\nso picking my time zone and so on.\n\n250\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.810\nSo it's easy to opt out of\nthe location services and\n\n251\n00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.390\nthe sharing your usage information.\n\n252\n00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.294\nPicking your time zone is next, so\nthat the clock will be be set right.\n\n253\n00:11:24.294 --> 00:11:28.350\nBy default it's gonna synchronize\nyour clock against Apple servers.\n\n254\n00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.552\nYou can change this in another place,\nit doesn't let you change it here.\n\n255\n00:11:30.552 --> 00:11:34.298\nBut later on we can go into preferences\nand make adjustments there as well, but\n\n256\n00:11:34.298 --> 00:11:37.290\nI'll set my time zone and\nstep forward on that.\n\n257\n00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:38.230\nHere's the usage analytics.\n\n258\n00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.751\nWhen we saw location services\ntwo screens ago, this one is,\n\n259\n00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:44.176\ndo I wanna share information with Apple?\n\n260\n00:11:44.176 --> 00:11:47.439\nAnd the first one is just\nsharing with Apple, the second\n\n261\n00:11:47.439 --> 00:11:51.963\none is sharing with the app developers\nas well, third party app developers.\n\n262\n00:11:51.963 --> 00:11:54.140\nYou may wanna opt out of one and\n\n263\n00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.970\nnot the other,\nmay wanna opt out of both, all right.\n\n264\n00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.130\nI'll go ahead and\nopt out of both, why not?\n\n265\n00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.516\nNormally I do leave that on because,\nhow are developers supposed to know how to\n\n266\n00:12:03.516 --> 00:12:06.899\nfix an app if they don't know there is\na problem, right, I like to share that so\n\n267\n00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:08.158\nthey know what they work on.\n\n268\n00:12:08.158 --> 00:12:10.411\nBut you certainly don't have to.\n\n269\n00:12:10.411 --> 00:12:14.005\nThat's basically it, at that point\nwe're done with the initial setup.\n\n270\n00:12:14.005 --> 00:12:17.394\nAnd if we think about the five things that\nI said at the beginning of the episode,\n\n271\n00:12:17.394 --> 00:12:19.170\nright, migrate previous data.\n\n272\n00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.110\nWe saw that in the migration assistant.\n\n273\n00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.010\nWe had configure networking.\n\n274\n00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.530\nWell I didn't see that one,\nright, but it's gonna try and\n\n275\n00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.150\ndo the defaults and hopefully it works.\n\n276\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.254\nConfigure user accounts, well, we saw the\nadministrator account, not other users, so\n\n277\n00:12:32.254 --> 00:12:33.611\nwe're kinda part way there.\n\n278\n00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:37.230\nAdjust general system settings and\npreferences.\n\n279\n00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.640\nIt asks us a bit about that with privacy,\nbut it didn't really go beyond that.\n\n280\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.350\nAnd then lastly,\n\n281\n00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.790\nconfigure software updates,\nI didn't see that one at all, right?\n\n282\n00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:52.455\nWell, in newer versions of MacOS,\nsoftware updates are turned on by default.\n\n283\n00:12:52.455 --> 00:12:54.082\nBut we may still need to tweak them and\n\n284\n00:12:54.082 --> 00:12:57.318\nadjust them to get them set right.\n&gt;&gt; But what if we change our mind, can we\n\n285\n00:12:57.318 --> 00:13:01.763\nrun the migration assistant later on?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the migration assistant,\n\n286\n00:13:01.763 --> 00:13:02.746\nI chose to skip it.\n\n287\n00:13:02.746 --> 00:13:06.371\nAnd then I told guys that you can't\nrun the wizard again, that's it,\n\n288\n00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:09.205\nthe one way is not supported and\nit can cause problems.\n\n289\n00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:13.430\nBut the migration assistant is\nthe one exception to that rule, right.\n\n290\n00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.858\nYou're always better off running\nthe migration assistant as part of that\n\n291\n00:13:16.858 --> 00:13:18.411\ninitial configuration wizard.\n\n292\n00:13:18.411 --> 00:13:21.463\nBut if you didn't and\nyou change your mind down the road,\n\n293\n00:13:21.463 --> 00:13:25.863\nthen you can run it later on, it's the one\ntool that it does let you run it later on.\n\n294\n00:13:25.863 --> 00:13:29.797\nThe reason I say you're better\noff to run it early on is,\n\n295\n00:13:29.797 --> 00:13:35.440\nlet's see I've got an old Mac and I log\ninto it as a user account named Don Pezet.\n\n296\n00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.320\nWell, now I've got this new Mac.\n\n297\n00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.323\nAnd I log into it with an account\ncalled Don Pezet, same username, right.\n\n298\n00:13:41.323 --> 00:13:46.260\nIf I try and run the migration assistant\nand it sees the user already exists,\n\n299\n00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.150\nit'll fail, it causes problems.\n\n300\n00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.886\nSo what I would have to do is I would\nhave to delete this Don Pezet account I\n\n301\n00:13:52.886 --> 00:13:56.336\njust created, and then I'll be\nable to migrate the old one over.\n\n302\n00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:59.860\nIf I was doing it in the initial setup,\nI wouldn't have any user accounts yet.\n\n303\n00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.610\nThat screen came up before I\ngot to the add a user screen.\n\n304\n00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:08.000\nAnd it would bring the old users over and\nmake the right ones administrators,\n\n305\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.120\nand I'd be in business.\n\n306\n00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.430\nThat's the better way to do it,\nyou avoid user conflicts.\n\n307\n00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.443\nBut if you don't have a user conflict, if\nyou just used some temporary name here and\n\n308\n00:14:15.443 --> 00:14:17.914\nyou bring it over, then it's no big deal,\nyou can run it whenever.\n\n309\n00:14:17.914 --> 00:14:25.730\nIn fact if you browse on your had drive,\nwe can dive into our Application folder.\n\n310\n00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.502\nAnd inside of the Application folder,\nthere is another folder called Utilities.\n\n311\n00:14:29.502 --> 00:14:31.717\nAnd inside of Utilities folder,\n\n312\n00:14:31.717 --> 00:14:35.950\nyou can find the Migration Assistant\nright there, right?\n\n313\n00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:41.802\nAnd you can relaunch that and\nthat takes us back into that basic setup.\n\n314\n00:14:41.802 --> 00:14:44.574\nHad I chosen to run\nthe migration assistant before,\n\n315\n00:14:44.574 --> 00:14:47.157\nit would have taken me to\nthis screen basically,\n\n316\n00:14:47.157 --> 00:14:50.910\nkinda moved me into that process,\nthe migration assistant.\n\n317\n00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.216\nAnd the migration assistant itself,\nit's actually really straight forward.\n\n318\n00:14:54.216 --> 00:14:57.870\nWe've got enough time in this episode,\nlet me kinda walk through what that\n\n319\n00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:58.878\nlooks like.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n320\n00:14:58.878 --> 00:15:00.919\nplease do.\n&gt;&gt; If we wanna migrate it in,\n\n321\n00:15:00.919 --> 00:15:05.142\nthe first thing we have to do is we have\nto tell the, well, we're an administrator,\n\n322\n00:15:05.142 --> 00:15:09.070\nright, I need to have administrator\nprivileges to bring in data.\n\n323\n00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:13.310\nBut then we need to tell it what kind of\nstuff we're going to be working with.\n\n324\n00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:18.680\nAnd I need to be able to tell it that\nI'm going to be importing from a Mac or\n\n325\n00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.480\nfrom Windows or from whatever.\n\n326\n00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.370\nSee this screen, it should look darn\nnear identical to the screen that we saw\n\n327\n00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:28.190\nbefore, except I don't have\na don't migrate option,\n\n328\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.490\nbecause I launched the wizard,\nI must want to migrate.\n\n329\n00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:36.420\nIt's just asking, am I migrating from\na Mac or from a Windows machine, right?\n\n330\n00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.860\nAnd there is a difference here\nin how this is all gonna work.\n\n331\n00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:44.990\nThe basic process is that we run the\nmigration assistant on our new machine,\n\n332\n00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.766\nand it starts listening.\n\n333\n00:15:46.766 --> 00:15:48.845\nIt's listening on the network for\nan old machine.\n\n334\n00:15:48.845 --> 00:15:53.768\nAnd then we run the Migration Assistant\non the old machine and it looks and\n\n335\n00:15:53.768 --> 00:15:56.522\nit finds the new machine on the network.\n\n336\n00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:59.920\nAnd then it transfers the data over\nthe network to the new machine, and\n\n337\n00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.180\nyou're done, right?\n\n338\n00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.567\nIt's a pretty straight forward process.\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n339\n00:16:03.567 --> 00:16:04.835\n&gt;&gt; Now the thing about is,\n\n340\n00:16:04.835 --> 00:16:07.943\nif your old machine is a Windows machine,\nBelieve or not,\n\n341\n00:16:07.943 --> 00:16:11.496\nMicrosoft doesn't include the Mac\nmigration tool with Windows,\n\n342\n00:16:11.496 --> 00:16:16.390\ncuz they don't want you to migrate to Mac,\nthey want to stay in Windows, right.\n\n343\n00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.870\nSo we have to get that from Apple.\n\n344\n00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.330\nYou can go to Apple's website and\ndownload it.\n\n345\n00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.450\nIn fact, it will even get us the link\nhere in a minute where we can go and\n\n346\n00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:23.520\nwe can download that.\n\n347\n00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.950\nAnd you can load that\non the Windows machine.\n\n348\n00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.450\nThat's a different step if\nyou're coming from Windows.\n\n349\n00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.606\nBut if you're coming from Mac,\nit's really straight forward.\n\n350\n00:16:30.606 --> 00:16:32.731\nThe migration assistant\nis already on the Mac,\n\n351\n00:16:32.731 --> 00:16:35.401\nbecause they want you to migrate\nfrom one Mac to the new one.\n\n352\n00:16:35.401 --> 00:16:37.387\nThey want you to buy new Macs.\n\n353\n00:16:37.387 --> 00:16:41.004\nSo they've got that right in there,\nand the key thing to remember here,\n\n354\n00:16:41.004 --> 00:16:43.853\nis although I wanna to install\nthe migration assistant,\n\n355\n00:16:43.853 --> 00:16:46.560\nI just have to make sure it's up to date.\n\n356\n00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.960\nEvery time Apple releases\na new update to Mac OS,\n\n357\n00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.230\nthey update the migration assistant,\neven for the older OSs.\n\n358\n00:16:54.230 --> 00:17:00.242\nSo way back in episode one,\nI said how we can install Mac OS 10.13\n\n359\n00:17:00.242 --> 00:17:06.062\nHigh Sierra on any machine running OS 10,\n10.8, or newer.\n\n360\n00:17:06.062 --> 00:17:11.270\nWell, all the way back to OS 10.8,\nif you run an iTunes update\n\n361\n00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:16.210\nright now it'll find an update for\nthe migration assistant.\n\n362\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.300\nAnd it'll load it and it'll have it.\n\n363\n00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.930\nThey've updated all the way back to that\none, because they want you to be able to\n\n364\n00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.360\nmigrate it over to the newer system,\nright?\n\n365\n00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.230\nSo on your older machine, and\n\n366\n00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.570\none of the first steps you need to\ndo is just run the software updates.\n\n367\n00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:33.120\nUpdate the oldest machine to the newest\nset of patches that are supported.\n\n368\n00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.648\nAnd once you're there, now it's got\nthe latest migration assistant, and\n\n369\n00:17:37.648 --> 00:17:38.789\nwe can go forward.\n\n370\n00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:42.824\nIf you're on a Windows machine,\nwhat you would do instead,\n\n371\n00:17:42.824 --> 00:17:45.560\nis you would browse to this website.\n\n372\n00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.780\nAnd it's gonna give us\nthe link in a minute, and\n\n373\n00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.030\nI'll put the link in the show notes so\nyou have it as well.\n\n374\n00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:53.070\nBut basically, it's just telling you\nthe steps of migrating from Windows PC.\n\n375\n00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.710\nAnd as you scroll down,\n\n376\n00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:59.610\nhere it is, they've got two different\nWindows migration assistants.\n\n377\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.450\nOne for Mac OS Sierra or later.\n\n378\n00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.670\nThat's what we would need.\n\n379\n00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:06.450\nAnd then one for OS X El Capitan or\nearlier, so those are for\n\n380\n00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.990\nthe previous operating systems.\n\n381\n00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.865\nSo for me, I would need this first\none here, the Mac OS Sierra or\n\n382\n00:18:11.865 --> 00:18:13.048\nlater installer.\n\n383\n00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:15.890\nBut I would install that\non my Windows machine.\n\n384\n00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.380\nAnd then I would run it,\nto be able to migrate the data over.\n\n385\n00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.710\nNow, in my case, I've got a Mac.\n\n386\n00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:24.110\nAnd so I'm gonna bring data from a Mac,\nto be able to migrate it right in.\n\n387\n00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:29.590\nNow, where that data comes from,\ndepends on a few things, all right?\n\n388\n00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:35.325\nOne, I can migrate from another Mac\nthat's running on the network right now.\n\n389\n00:18:35.325 --> 00:18:38.310\nMaybe I have my old laptop,\nand I've got my new laptop.\n\n390\n00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.270\nAnd I've got them both running side by\nside, I want to bring the data over.\n\n391\n00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:47.620\nBut, what if the reason I got a new\nlaptop, was that my old one was stolen?\n\n392\n00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:52.100\nOr maybe it's just broken, it won't power\non anymore, and I can't fire it up?\n\n393\n00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.060\nWell, that from a Mac\npart is not gonna work.\n\n394\n00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.170\nIt expects both of them to be talking\non the network at the same time.\n\n395\n00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.370\nThe second option though,\nfrom a Time Machine backup,\n\n396\n00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.501\nthat's a really cool option.\n\n397\n00:19:02.501 --> 00:19:06.851\nI can hook up my Time Machine drive\nto this computer and it will find my\n\n398\n00:19:06.851 --> 00:19:11.440\ntime machine backup, and it will migrate\nthe user setting in there, all right?\n\n399\n00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.557\nNow, you might ask yourself,\n\n400\n00:19:13.557 --> 00:19:17.722\ncouldn't we just restore\nthe Time Machine back up, right?\n\n401\n00:19:17.722 --> 00:19:21.566\nBut the reason when I want to do that is\nif the Time Machine backup was an older\n\n402\n00:19:21.566 --> 00:19:25.182\nversion of Mac OS, then it's gonna\ndowngrade our operating system.\n\n403\n00:19:25.182 --> 00:19:26.947\nI don't wanna downgrade\nthe operating system,\n\n404\n00:19:26.947 --> 00:19:29.872\nI just wanna bring the user settings and\nthat's what the time machine option lets\n\n405\n00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:31.443\nme do.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n406\n00:19:31.443 --> 00:19:32.675\n&gt;&gt; The third option is if wanna bring\n\n407\n00:19:32.675 --> 00:19:34.140\nit from a startup disc.\n\n408\n00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.983\nStartup disk means that I've taken\nthe hard drive from the old computer and\n\n409\n00:19:37.983 --> 00:19:40.248\nI've added it to the new computer somehow.\n\n410\n00:19:40.248 --> 00:19:42.469\nA lot of times, this means like\nbooting it up in target mode and\n\n411\n00:19:42.469 --> 00:19:44.110\nhooking it up as a hard drive that way.\n\n412\n00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:47.850\nIt's probably least common of\nthe methods for migrating over.\n\n413\n00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.330\nUsually, it's gonna be\none of the first two.\n\n414\n00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.910\nAnd if you've got a Time Machine backup,\nthat's usually the best way.\n\n415\n00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.920\nCuz I don't have to do\nanything to the old Mac.\n\n416\n00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.450\nI don't have to upgrade its\nmigration assistant or anything.\n\n417\n00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.360\nIt just brings it right in from that Time\nMachine backup to incorporate that data.\n\n418\n00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:07.620\nSo, if I choose from a Mac and I move\nforward, now it's gonna start listening\n\n419\n00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.790\nto people on the network that\nit can get data from, right.\n\n420\n00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.830\nSo it's listening and\n\n421\n00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.700\ntrying to find somebody else\nwho's transmitting that data.\n\n422\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.890\nNow, we actually have two little\nstorage devices on our network.\n\n423\n00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.936\nAnd they're both set up as Time Machine\nservers and so it found those immediately.\n\n424\n00:20:23.936 --> 00:20:26.918\nHere's these two time machine servers\nI could pick one from those and\n\n425\n00:20:26.918 --> 00:20:28.560\nmigrate data from there.\n\n426\n00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.064\nBut it's also looking for\n\n427\n00:20:30.064 --> 00:20:33.901\nany Mac that's running on the network\nthat's ready to transmit.\n\n428\n00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:39.031\nIf I pick one of these, let's see, eeny\nmeeny miny moe, I'll go with the left one.\n\n429\n00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:42.202\nSo, if I pick one of these and\nmove forward, it should then show me\n\n430\n00:20:42.202 --> 00:20:45.605\nthe backups that are available on that,\nshoot, I don't know the,\n\n431\n00:20:45.605 --> 00:20:49.970\nwell maybe I know the password, we'll see.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n432\n00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.470\n&gt;&gt; Nate, our IT guy,\nhe runs these servers,\n\n433\n00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:57.320\nand not sure that I know the password,\nbut, no I don't.\n\n434\n00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.637\nAll right, well anyhow,\nif I knew the password, I could connect.\n\n435\n00:20:59.637 --> 00:21:02.550\nIt would show me all the backups,\nand I could migrate data from there.\n\n436\n00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:07.720\nAll right, but what I really need to do,\nis go over to my old Mac and\n\n437\n00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.560\nfire the migration assistant there.\n\n438\n00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:14.450\nNow, when you fire it up on the other\nsystem, it looks just like this, but\n\n439\n00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.340\nyou've got this third option down here.\n\n440\n00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.048\nNot from something but\nto something, to another Mac.\n\n441\n00:21:21.048 --> 00:21:25.250\nThat's saying, hey, this is my old Mac and\nI want to send data somewhere else.\n\n442\n00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.353\nSo when you say to another Mac and\n\n443\n00:21:27.353 --> 00:21:32.490\nhit continue, it's gonna start\nbroadcasting a message on the network.\n\n444\n00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.622\nSee it says that I'm now\ndiscoverable as Don's Mac.\n\n445\n00:21:35.622 --> 00:21:38.445\nSo now I'm broadcasting out on my new Mac.\n\n446\n00:21:38.445 --> 00:21:42.701\nThis would all the sudden show up as\nan icon, and I could click that icon and\n\n447\n00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:44.771\nmove forward with that as a source.\n\n448\n00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:47.976\nAnd that's what Apple is showing here\nin the article for the Windows machine.\n\n449\n00:21:47.976 --> 00:21:50.286\nIs that they basically fired up, and\n\n450\n00:21:50.286 --> 00:21:54.532\nthey say that the data is gonna be\ncoming from a Windows machine, and\n\n451\n00:21:54.532 --> 00:21:59.474\nwhen you see it on the network it shows\nup, and it's got a little code, right?\n\n452\n00:21:59.474 --> 00:22:01.510\nThat code is important, right?\n\n453\n00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.680\nIf I start broadcasting, I'm broadcasting\nright now, which I think I am.\n\n454\n00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.510\nSo, I'm broadcasting right now.\n\n455\n00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:12.192\nIn theory, somebody else on my\nnetwork can fire up a Mac and say,\n\n456\n00:22:12.192 --> 00:22:16.094\nhey, I'm the destination and\nsee me in connect, and\n\n457\n00:22:16.094 --> 00:22:19.590\nnow they could download\nmy whole user profile.\n\n458\n00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.398\nEven if I had file vaults which\nencrypts the data on your disk,\n\n459\n00:22:22.398 --> 00:22:24.782\nthis is going over the network\nit's not encrypted.\n\n460\n00:22:24.782 --> 00:22:29.072\nSo they would have access to all my data,\nthat would be really really bad.\n\n461\n00:22:29.072 --> 00:22:30.415\nSo it puts a code up and\n\n462\n00:22:30.415 --> 00:22:35.190\nthe code has to be entered in order\nto move forward with the migration.\n\n463\n00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.560\nSo, you've gotta make sure that\nthe code matches, you punch it in and\n\n464\n00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.820\nthat's what's gonna connect\nthe two machines, and\n\n465\n00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.430\nonce they're connected,\nthen it can bring the user accounts over.\n\n466\n00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:48.379\nAnd when it brings the user accounts over\nit brings their music, their pictures,\n\n467\n00:22:48.379 --> 00:22:51.415\ntheir desktop, all their little\nsettings and preferences and\n\n468\n00:22:51.415 --> 00:22:55.043\nall the other things that you might tweak,\ncustomize with a user profile.\n\n469\n00:22:55.043 --> 00:22:59.374\nIt brings all of that in,\nthe only thing that it doesn't bring,\n\n470\n00:22:59.374 --> 00:23:01.311\nare applications, right.\n\n471\n00:23:01.311 --> 00:23:03.276\nIf you have applications\ninstalled in the old Mac,\n\n472\n00:23:03.276 --> 00:23:05.617\nyou'll need to install those\napplications on your new Mac.\n\n473\n00:23:05.617 --> 00:23:07.661\nYou get applications that\nare solid on Windows, well,\n\n474\n00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:09.356\nthose aren't gonna run on your Mac anyway,\nso\n\n475\n00:23:09.356 --> 00:23:11.938\nyou've got to find alternate\napplications that will run on your Mac.\n\n476\n00:23:11.938 --> 00:23:15.018\nBut once that's done,\nall of your settings have migrated over,\n\n477\n00:23:15.018 --> 00:23:19.330\nand now, you're back in business.\n&gt;&gt; Don, I know you have a lot more to talk\n\n478\n00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:23.180\nabout and I want to hear a lot more,\nbecause this is exciting stuff.\n\n479\n00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.840\nSetting all of this up is fantastic,\nbut we're going to have to probably go\n\n480\n00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.961\nto a part two what do you think?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n481\n00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:32.131\nwhat we've seen here is all kind\nof the defaulty stuff, right?\n\n482\n00:23:32.131 --> 00:23:34.095\nIt's just moving through the wizards, but\n\n483\n00:23:34.095 --> 00:23:37.870\nthere's a lot of stuff we might want to\nchange that isn't a part of the wizard.\n\n484\n00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.720\nAnd so I want to spend some time\ngoing over those settings and\n\n485\n00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.460\nwhere we find them.\n\n486\n00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.310\nWe still haven't looked at network at all.\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n487\n00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.520\n&gt;&gt; Network is kinda important if you're\n\n488\n00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.450\ngonna run that migration\nassistant across the network you\n\n489\n00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.310\nsort of need to be on the network, right?\n\n490\n00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.240\nSo, let's tackle all of that in part two,\nbut here in part one we did get a good\n\n491\n00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:58.550\nchance to see all of the default stuff\nthat we can assume that anybody has run.\n\n492\n00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.900\nIn part two we'll see the things\nthat we can't assume people have.\n\n493\n00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.390\n&gt;&gt; And I can't wait to see part two\n\n494\n00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.140\nof initial configuration.\n\n495\n00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.980\nApple Certified Support Professional\nis a wonderful series,\n\n496\n00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.350\nDon has worked very hard to\nput that together for you.\n\n497\n00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.760\nMake sure you watch every episode, and\nyou'll be in the course library and\n\n498\n00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.490\nthere's thousands of other videos

00:00:13.401\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:17.540\nchoosing ITPro TV, empowering\nthe world through engaging learning.\n\n5\n00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.910\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n6\n00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.200\nAs we continue with Apple\ncertified support professional,\n\n7\n00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.155\nthis is Initial Configuration, Part 2.\n\n8\n00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:29.732\nAnd bringing us the information\nwe need is Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:29.732 --> 00:00:33.258\nOf course, Don, good to see you.\n&gt;&gt; Hey hey, glad to be back and now\n\n10\n00:00:33.258 --> 00:00:36.815\nwe've gotta live up to that great intro.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:37.712\n&gt;&gt; So, in part 1,\n\n12\n00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:41.822\nwe had a chance to see some of the things\nwe need to get set up on a brand new Mac,\n\n13\n00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:44.163\nor a Mac that's been recently installed.\n\n14\n00:00:44.163 --> 00:00:46.807\nAnd we walked through kind\nof the general stuff,\n\n15\n00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:49.103\nthe things that are built\ninto the wizard that hey,\n\n16\n00:00:49.103 --> 00:00:52.707\nit's stuff that needs to get done, that's\nnot the most exciting in the planet.\n\n17\n00:00:52.707 --> 00:00:56.347\nSo we kind of walk through that,\nwhat each part was, why it was there,\n\n18\n00:00:56.347 --> 00:00:58.753\nwhy it existed, and\nat the end of the episode,\n\n19\n00:00:58.753 --> 00:01:02.050\nwe had pretty much everything\nset up the way we wanted, right?\n\n20\n00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.805\nThe wizard does a really good job of\ncovering all these basic settings, and\n\n21\n00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:07.723\nthen we're usually up and good to go.\n\n22\n00:01:07.723 --> 00:01:11.095\nAnd there might be some other things that\nwe need to tweak every here and that but\n\n23\n00:01:11.095 --> 00:01:13.341\nfor the most parts we knock all out and\nnow we are up and\n\n24\n00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:16.149\nready to go.\n&gt;&gt; But what is we wanna change something\n\n25\n00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.660\nthat isn't in the wizard?\n&gt;&gt; Alright\n\n26\n00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.940\nthat's where we get into what's a little\nmore common, real world, right?\n\n27\n00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.520\nThe wizard, you run it once, and\nit's done, then you use the computer for\n\n28\n00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.570\nyears, hopefully years, and there will be\nlots of little things you wanna change,\n\n29\n00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.370\ntweak, alter, modify, whatever.\n\n30\n00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.714\nAnd you can do that, but, Zach, you had\nasked the question the last episode,\n\n31\n00:01:36.714 --> 00:01:39.363\nyou said do we have to hunt\naround to find all these options?\n\n32\n00:01:39.363 --> 00:01:39.999\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n33\n00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.527\nthat's the thing.\n&gt;&gt; And I said no,\n\n34\n00:01:41.527 --> 00:01:44.402\nwe've got the great wizard, right?\n&gt;&gt; Well, now the wizard is done,\n\n35\n00:01:44.402 --> 00:01:45.510\nit's gone.\n\n36\n00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.900\nSo, now, yeah,\nwe do have hunt around for things.\n\n37\n00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.510\nWe have to find what we want.\n\n38\n00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.430\nMost of what we set up,\nwe can actually change after the fact.\n\n39\n00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.710\nThere's some things that you can't,\nlike creating that initial admin user.\n\n40\n00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.040\nThat's been done, now,\nI have to create users a different way.\n\n41\n00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.910\nWe have to hunt around a bit.\n\n42\n00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.095\nBut, it's not so bad, right?\n\n43\n00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:07.150\nApple uses the system preferences tool to\ngather all this stuff together, right?\n\n44\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.320\nMost users are familiar\nwith system preferences.\n\n45\n00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.990\nEven your most casual Mac user will\nencounter them sooner or later.\n\n46\n00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.516\nBut they work on a really simple idea,\n\n47\n00:02:15.516 --> 00:02:19.230\nthat all the settings are supposed\nto be gathered in one place.\n\n48\n00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.590\nNow that sounds good, don't have to\nhunt around, they're all in one place.\n\n49\n00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.510\nBut there's so many settings that\njust gathering them into one place\n\n50\n00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.870\nstill doesn't really help us,\nyou gotta hunt around inside of there.\n\n51\n00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.200\nSo let me show you a few\ndifferent methods we have for\n\n52\n00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.550\nfinding the settings that we want.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n53\n00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.410\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go into the System\n\n54\n00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.300\nPreferences screen, so I'm just\ngonna use the Apple menu up top and\n\n55\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.470\ngo down to System Preferences.\n\n56\n00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.870\nAnd we're gonna pull\nthe System Preferences window.\n\n57\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.420\nAnd I'll tell you, there's a lot of people\nI've talked to, they've been Mac users for\n\n58\n00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.700\nyears and years.\n\n59\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.029\nThat never realized that\nthere is actually an order,\n\n60\n00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.470\nan arrangement, to what I'm\nlooking at here in this screen.\n\n61\n00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.270\nAt first glance it just looks\nlike a bunch of icons, well,\n\n62\n00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.200\nprobably because it is a bunch of icons.\n\n63\n00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.850\nBut they're organized icons.\n\n64\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.210\nSee the color bands here?\n\n65\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.480\nI've got a light grey band, and then\na darker grey, and then light grey and\n\n66\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.320\nthen darker grey.\n\n67\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.879\nYou may see up to five bands in here.\n\n68\n00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.311\nI've only got four, on a brand new fresh\ninstall, you just going to have four.\n\n69\n00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:24.065\nLet's take my actual lap top, so I'm using\nvirtual machines for a lot of this stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:24.065 --> 00:03:27.445\nBut this is my actual laptop,\nat least I think it is.\n\n71\n00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:30.445\nSo [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this right here is not a VM.\n\n72\n00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:31.423\n&gt;&gt; There we go, yep,\n\n73\n00:03:31.423 --> 00:03:35.115\nso this is my Macbook Pro 13 inch,\nso this is my actual Mac.\n\n74\n00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:39.930\nAnd if I go into my System Preferences and\nI take a look,\n\n75\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.300\nI've got one, two, three four, and then\nI've got a fifth band down here, right?\n\n76\n00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.275\nThat fifth band is an optional one,\nbecause it's preferences for\n\n77\n00:03:49.275 --> 00:03:50.730\nthird-party software.\n\n78\n00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.650\nSo I've got my Logitech Control Center, or\n\n79\n00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.390\nthe Adobe Flash player,\nthose preferences end up down there.\n\n80\n00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.300\nOn a new install, you don't have\nany third-party software yet.\n\n81\n00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.030\nAnd so that band doesn't show up,\nit's just not here.\n\n82\n00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.680\nThat category is missing, right?\n\n83\n00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.610\nAlso, depending on how many icons you\nhave and how you've resized the window,\n\n84\n00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.370\nthey may all fit on one line,\nthey may not fit on one line.\n\n85\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.490\nSo some things might look\na little bit different.\n\n86\n00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.060\nBut each of these bands\nis a different category.\n\n87\n00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.860\nAnd they're not named so it's hard\nto know that a category even exists.\n\n88\n00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.510\nBut they are actually divided up.\n\n89\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.180\nThe first category here is\ncalled Personal Preferences.\n\n90\n00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.220\nThese are preferences that\naffect usually just you.\n\n91\n00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.584\nI might have five user\naccounts on this computer,\n\n92\n00:04:31.584 --> 00:04:35.050\neach user account could have\na different desktop and screen saver.\n\n93\n00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.260\nThey could have the dock\nconfigured a different way, or\n\n94\n00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.790\nmission control a different way.\n\n95\n00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.920\nThey can use different languages on the\nsystem depending on which users log in.\n\n96\n00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.160\nThese are personal.\n\n97\n00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.950\nNow, it used to be a really\ngood line where they said hey,\n\n98\n00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.780\nthis is stuff that just affects you.\n\n99\n00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.660\nBut in newer versions of macOS,\nreally ever since 10.8,\n\n100\n00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.600\nwe really have started to see where\nthat line gets blurred a little bit.\n\n101\n00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.690\nSo, for example,\nif I go into Security &amp; Privacy,\n\n102\n00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.120\nthere's the setting for FileVault,\nto turn on disk encryption.\n\n103\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.670\nIf I encrypt the disk,\nit encrypts the entire disk.\n\n104\n00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.400\nThat doesn't just affect me, does it?\n\n105\n00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.640\nIt affects everybody who uses the system.\n\n106\n00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.030\nNot so personal anymore, right?\n\n107\n00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.110\nSo be careful with that, that the original\ndesign, the Steve Jobs design,\n\n108\n00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.240\nwas that this would just be settings\nthat affected your user account.\n\n109\n00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.761\nNow there's just a couple in there\nthat can affect more than just you.\n\n110\n00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:33.170\nThe second band, that one is hardware.\n\n111\n00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.320\nThis is gonna pertain to\nthe hardware that's in your device.\n\n112\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.130\nAnd I may have some icons that you don't.\n\n113\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.970\nYou may have some icons that I don't,\njust depends on your computer.\n\n114\n00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.750\nIf you're on a Mac Mini,\nyou see one thing, if you're on a Macbook,\n\n115\n00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.750\nyou see another.\n\n116\n00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.460\nSo for example, I'm on a virtual machine,\nand my virtual machine has a CD drive, so\n\n117\n00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.950\nI see CDs &amp; DVDs, right?\n\n118\n00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.400\nBut if you buy a real Mac today\nit's not gonna have a CD drive,\n\n119\n00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.320\nright, my Macbook doesn't have one.\n\n120\n00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.150\nSo again if I go back to my real desktop\nhere and I look at the hardware band\n\n121\n00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.960\nI don't see CDs &amp; DVDs,\ncuz I don't have a drive, right?\n\n122\n00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.300\nIf I were to stick a super drive\non this thing then I would see it,\n\n123\n00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.610\nright, but I don't have one.\n\n124\n00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.780\nI do have one but\nI don't have a USB-C adapter for\n\n125\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.840\nit so, either way, not gonna work.\n\n126\n00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.980\nSo, I don't see it here, right?\n\n127\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.500\nAnd that varies, again,\nbased on your hardware.\n\n128\n00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.040\nSo I wanna change a hardware preference,\nthat's where I'm gonna go, right?\n\n129\n00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.630\nThe next one after that,\nwhere we see iCloud and\n\n130\n00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.190\nInternet accounts, this one is considered\nthe Internet and Wireless group.\n\n131\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.230\nSo all of your Internet settings, what\ngets you connected out to the Internet,\n\n132\n00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.840\nwireless settings for\nconnecting your local network, and\n\n133\n00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.660\nanything along those lines\nis still right in here.\n\n134\n00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.450\nNow they group Bluetooth in.\n\n135\n00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.180\nMost people don't think of\nBluetooth as networking, but\n\n136\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.440\nit is a wireless network between\nyour computer and accessories.\n\n137\n00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.862\nSo you may have a Bluetooth headset or\nwhatever and it will connect there.\n\n138\n00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:55.560\nYou've got Sharing, for\nsharing folders on the network.\n\n139\n00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.610\nThose things fall on that band as well.\n\n140\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.800\nThe next one, right down here,\nthe fourth band, or\n\n141\n00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.480\nwhat would be the last\none on a default install.\n\n142\n00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.520\nThis is our system band,\nthese are ones that affect, well,\n\n143\n00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.277\nthe entire system, right?\n\n144\n00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.830\nIf I come in here and\nI set up Siri, or the Date and\n\n145\n00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.070\nTime, Time Machine backups,\nAccessibility options.\n\n146\n00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.360\nThese affect the entire computer, right?\n\n147\n00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.180\nAnd they apply to the system and\n\n148\n00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.320\nyou need to be an administrator\nto change these things.\n\n149\n00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.500\nI can go in and create users and\ngroups, I can set up parental controls.\n\n150\n00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.610\nThose are things that are part\nof the system, all right?\n\n151\n00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.501\nThat just leaves us with the last category\nhere, which the official name of it is\n\n152\n00:07:34.501 --> 00:07:36.110\nOther, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n153\n00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.590\n&gt;&gt; But I usually just call it third party\n\n154\n00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.080\nbecause that's what comes in here.\n\n155\n00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.560\nThese are the preferences for\nany third party stuff I've installed.\n\n156\n00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.891\nIn my case, the Logitech Control Center,\ncuz I have a wireless keyboard and\n\n157\n00:07:46.891 --> 00:07:51.424\ntrackball back in my office, and then\nthe Flash Player because I needed that for\n\n158\n00:07:51.424 --> 00:07:52.995\nsome program I installed.\n\n159\n00:07:52.995 --> 00:07:57.185\nBut those turn up, and you'll see other\nthings pop up in here as you add software,\n\n160\n00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:59.085\nit just depends on what you install.\n\n161\n00:07:59.085 --> 00:08:02.156\nAnd it may even be hardware that you've\nadded that puts something, well,\n\n162\n00:08:02.156 --> 00:08:03.093\nlike my Logitech one.\n\n163\n00:08:03.093 --> 00:08:07.122\nThere's the hardware category up here.\n\n164\n00:08:07.122 --> 00:08:09.775\nWell these things like track pad and\nkeyboard,\n\n165\n00:08:09.775 --> 00:08:13.902\nthese affect my Logitech keyboard,\nthey affect my Logitech track ball.\n\n166\n00:08:13.902 --> 00:08:18.786\nBut the Control Center itself is where we\ncan set up shortcuts that if you click\n\n167\n00:08:18.786 --> 00:08:20.439\nthis button on the mouse or\n\n168\n00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:24.373\nthis software key on the keyboard\nit does some sort of action.\n\n169\n00:08:24.373 --> 00:08:27.050\nAnd so\nit ends up down here in the third party.\n\n170\n00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.960\nBut that's all of the settings\ntucked away right away here.\n\n171\n00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.726\nAnd the hardest part is\nfinding what you want, right.\n\n172\n00:08:34.726 --> 00:08:37.991\nSo I used FileVault as\nan example a moment ago, right.\n\n173\n00:08:37.991 --> 00:08:41.124\nNow I have it memorized,\nI've done it enough where it's easy,\n\n174\n00:08:41.124 --> 00:08:43.190\nI know exactly where to go for FileVault.\n\n175\n00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.970\nBut let's pretend for\na moment that we didn't know that.\n\n176\n00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.320\nI want to configure FileVault,\nthat's disk encryption,\n\n177\n00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.920\nthat affects the entire computer.\n\n178\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.720\nSo that would be down here in\nthe System category, right,\n\n179\n00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.180\nit affects the entire system.\n\n180\n00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.370\nTime machine, accessibility, Siri,\nparental controls, users and\n\n181\n00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.500\ngroups maybe, right.\n\n182\n00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.740\nI can go into Users and Groups and I don't\nreally see anything there on FileVault,\n\n183\n00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.360\nso where else could that be?\n\n184\n00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.540\nYou have to start guessing, right.\n\n185\n00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.980\nAnd each of these icons really represents\na collection of tens, if not even\n\n186\n00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.150\nhundreds, of additional configuration\noptions when you get inside of it.\n\n187\n00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.760\nSo fortunately we have this nice\nlittle search box up here at the top.\n\n188\n00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.060\nAnd with the search box you\ncan start to type something,\n\n189\n00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.710\nlike I'll type the word FileVault,\nor I'll just type file, right.\n\n190\n00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:36.060\nAnd you can see where it's showing me\nthings that it found that start with\n\n191\n00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.060\nthe word file, it was FileVault,\nfile sharing, those are the first two.\n\n192\n00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.810\nBut then we have block search of private\nfiles, back up and restore files.\n\n193\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.990\nWhat is it that I'm trying to do?\n\n194\n00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.660\nAnd it's putting a little\nhighlight on each\n\n195\n00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.210\nicon that matches some of the commands.\n\n196\n00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.680\nNow, it's hard to tell here cuz it\nlooks like they're all tied, but\n\n197\n00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.850\nthat highlight will get brighter the more\nclosely it matches what I typed.\n\n198\n00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:06.300\nSo for example, if I type file backup,\nwhoop, I lost everything.\n\n199\n00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.050\nLet me just do backup.\n\n200\n00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.130\nI tie it back up, there we go.\n\n201\n00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:16.590\nSee how Time Machine, that is a very\nclear, distinct circle, right.\n\n202\n00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:21.020\nBut when I step off of that a little bit,\ndown just to the word back,\n\n203\n00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.620\nnow I get a couple that are lit up and\nthey're dimmer circles,\n\n204\n00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.270\nletting me know that it's not exactly\na perfect match, that there may be a tie.\n\n205\n00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.100\nWell the cool part here is I don't have to\nknow which icon something is tucked away\n\n206\n00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.980\nunder, if I type FileVault it turns up and\n\n207\n00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.600\nnow I can come in and\nI know exactly where I need to click.\n\n208\n00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.156\nI need to go into this icon,\nand then I can come in and\n\n209\n00:10:42.156 --> 00:10:43.895\nI can find my settings from there.\n\n210\n00:10:43.895 --> 00:10:45.650\nSo makes it a little bit easier,\n\n211\n00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.550\nwe don't have to truly hunt around to\nfind this stuff, we can dive in and\n\n212\n00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.650\nget to the setting we want.\n&gt;&gt; And what about networking?\n\n213\n00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.760\nDo we need to configure that?\n\n214\n00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.130\nI mean cuz that's when we've\nactually got to do physically?\n\n215\n00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, absolutely.\n\n216\n00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.530\nSo most of these settings here you can\njust accept the defaults on, right.\n\n217\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.430\nAnd that's really what the initial\nconfiguration wizard was all about.\n\n218\n00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:10.000\nYou run through that wizard, it set\nmost everything up, and I'm good to go.\n\n219\n00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.490\nBut networking is kind\nof that one exception,\n\n220\n00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:16.310\nthat during the initial install,\nit never asked me about networking.\n\n221\n00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.070\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n222\n00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.290\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n223\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.190\nthere's usually a couple of reasons for\nthat.\n\n224\n00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.910\nOne, maybe I was plugged\ninto a physical network.\n\n225\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.510\nAnd so it saw the physical network and\nconfigured automatically.\n\n226\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:32.270\nOr two, maybe my hardware had already been\nsetup for a wireless network before and\n\n227\n00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.070\nit remembers it.\n\n228\n00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.260\nThat happens sometimes.\n\n229\n00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.580\nSo if that's the case,\nit'll try to auto configure.\n\n230\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.120\nBut typically for\nmy I do end up having to go in and\n\n231\n00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.540\nconfigure the networking services.\n\n232\n00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.300\nSo if we look at our\nsystem preferences here,\n\n233\n00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.100\nI've got a nice little icon down here for\nNetwork.\n\n234\n00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.560\nAnd I can go into Network and it's gonna\nshow the adapters connected to my system.\n\n235\n00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.780\nI've got an ethernet adapter, so\nit shows up right here, it says ethernet.\n\n236\n00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.890\nIt's connected, and\nit says it's using DHCP,\n\n237\n00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:02.010\nthat's the dynamic host\nconfiguration protocol.\n\n238\n00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:07.090\nAnd what DHCP does is it says, I'm gonna\nlet my computer connect to the network and\n\n239\n00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.410\ntry and learn the best settings to use.\n\n240\n00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.250\nAnd so it chats on the network, and\nthere's a server on the network somewhere,\n\n241\n00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.550\nor maybe a router, or a firewall,\nsome kind of device, that's running DHCP.\n\n242\n00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.630\nAnd it hears my computer come up and\nit says, hey, do you need an IP address?\n\n243\n00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.730\nHere let me give you one.\n\n244\n00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:24.500\nHow about a subnet mask?\n\n245\n00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.370\nI'll give you a subnet mask, too.\n\n246\n00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.610\nHow about a default router?\n\n247\n00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:27.310\nDNS servers?\n\n248\n00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.970\nIt gives us everything that we\nneed to know, and it's automatic.\n\n249\n00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.200\nThat's awesome, right, cuz we don't have\nto know anything about networking, and\n\n250\n00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.550\nit just works.\n\n251\n00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.960\nYou just connect and you are on.\n\n252\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.539\nBut maybe your business, or your home or\nwhatever, doesn't run DHCP?\n\n253\n00:12:43.539 --> 00:12:44.520\nNow you won't communicate on the network.\n\n254\n00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.160\nSo would need to come in here and\n\n255\n00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.790\ntell it that you're going to\nmanually assign an address, and\n\n256\n00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:55.040\nyou have to type in those values before\nyou'd be able to connect, right.\n\n257\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.710\nYou'd have to get in there and\nget involved.\n\n258\n00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.270\nOn an ethernet adapter that's easy,\n\n259\n00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:03.450\nyou just choose the adapter and\nyou type in that address, right.\n\n260\n00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.640\nI'm gonna revert mine.\n\n261\n00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.480\nOn wireless it's a little bit harder.\n\n262\n00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.540\nLet me jump over to my actual laptop here.\n\n263\n00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.550\nAnd on my actual laptop,\nif I go into Network,\n\n264\n00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.500\nI'll see multiple adapters, right.\n\n265\n00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.640\nSome of these are real adapters,\nsome of these are virtual adapters.\n\n266\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.402\nSo for example, my WiFi, that's a real\nadapter that's built into my laptop,\n\n267\n00:13:26.402 --> 00:13:28.660\nit's always there.\n\n268\n00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:33.400\nBut most of the other things you're\nseeing here, well not Bluetooth pen, but\n\n269\n00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:39.800\nthis AJA mini converter, USB 10, 100,\n1,000, that's my ethernet adapter.\n\n270\n00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.950\nThose are not on my laptop normally,\nright.\n\n271\n00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.730\nSo I have a MacBook Pro.\n\n272\n00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.150\nAnd in the new MacBook Pros\nyou get two USBC ports and\n\n273\n00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.460\nthat's it, no network jacks.\n\n274\n00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.750\nWhen I go back to my office,\n\n275\n00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:55.020\nI have a little hub that I plug in\nthat has an ethernet jack on it.\n\n276\n00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.960\nAnd so when I'm plugged in, this one\nwill turn green and it'll show up, and\n\n277\n00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.620\nthat's what I use when I'm in my office.\n\n278\n00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:05.980\nBut when I'm here, standing in the studio,\nI don't use that, I'm on the wireless.\n\n279\n00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.170\nSo choosing the right\nadapter is big part of this.\n\n280\n00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.970\nAnd when I choose that adapter,\nif it's wireless,\n\n281\n00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:17.340\nI have to pick what wireless\nnetwork I wanna connect to.\n\n282\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.610\nAnd so you can do that right here.\n\n283\n00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.700\nNotice how I'm not seeing\nthe IP address screens.\n\n284\n00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:27.122\nWhen I choose an ethernet adapter, like\nthis one, that's where I can come in and\n\n285\n00:14:27.122 --> 00:14:30.110\nI can say,\nI wanna manually assign an address.\n\n286\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:36.070\nBut when I do WiFi, I have to connect\nto the wireless network first.\n\n287\n00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.970\nOnce you're connected to the wireless\nnetwork you can go to Advanced, and\n\n288\n00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.830\nunder the Advanced screen you have TCPIP.\n\n289\n00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.550\nAnd that's where you'll see\nthat I'm using DHCP and\n\n290\n00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.250\nI could switch to manually if I want.\n\n291\n00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.615\nIt's just hidden an extra screen deep\nto get in there and set that one up.\n\n292\n00:14:51.615 --> 00:14:54.580\nBut once I get that configured\naccording to my network,\n\n293\n00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.450\nthen I should be able to talk,\nshould be able to communicate out.\n\n294\n00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.100\nAnd you can test it a few different ways.\n\n295\n00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:04.028\nOne of the best ways to test it, in my\nopinion cuz I'm sure there;s other ways,\n\n296\n00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:07.265\nis that when you have a new machine and\nit's set up and\n\n297\n00:15:07.265 --> 00:15:12.000\nyou just wanna make sure that it's\nworking, there is the Network utility.\n\n298\n00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.630\nIf you use your spotlight and\n\n299\n00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:17.160\njust type network, it's usually\nthe first thing that it finds.\n\n300\n00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.690\nSo I'm gonna fire up the Network utility.\n\n301\n00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:23.678\nAnd the network utility can show you\nthe configuration of your adapter,\n\n302\n00:15:23.678 --> 00:15:27.020\nand it's got Ping and Lookup utilities.\n\n303\n00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:34.160\nSo for example I can do a Lookup and see\nwhat is the IP address for www.apple.com?\n\n304\n00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:40.130\nAnd I can look that up, and\nit finds it, so I know that's working.\n\n305\n00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.750\nAnd then I can try and ping it if I\nwanted, or I could do it by name.\n\n306\n00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:48.690\nSo I'll go to Ping, and\nI'm gonna try and ping www.apple.com.\n\n307\n00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.690\nAnd I will ping that.\n\n308\n00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:55.558\nAnd now it's pinging out, so I know that\nI'm able to communicate on the network and\n\n309\n00:15:55.558 --> 00:15:58.670\ntalk and that things are working\nthe way that I expect them to work.\n\n310\n00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.750\nBut once that's set up, now our network's\ngood to go and we're ready to rock.\n\n311\n00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:06.153\nNow there is a lot more available when\nit comes to configuring networking.\n\n312\n00:16:06.153 --> 00:16:09.636\nBut we're gonna do some special\nshows that focus just on networking.\n\n313\n00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:12.970\nSo I'll save it for those episodes,\nI don't wanna go too far here.\n\n314\n00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.036\nBut what we've just seen is really\nthe basics or getting our network up and\n\n315\n00:16:16.036 --> 00:16:18.460\nrunning on a new Mac.\n&gt;&gt; Well now, that we're on the network,\n\n316\n00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.560\nwill the system keep itself up to date?\n&gt;&gt; Sort of.\n\n317\n00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.930\nSo I'm glad you asked cuz\nlet me show you this.\n\n318\n00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:30.028\nI think I mentioned in part one, that\na newer Mac or Macs running High Sierra,\n\n319\n00:16:30.028 --> 00:16:33.801\nsoftware updates are automatically\nturned on, right.\n\n320\n00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:38.715\nAnd that's true, but there's some caveats\nto it, and it's important that even though\n\n321\n00:16:38.715 --> 00:16:42.401\nthey're automatically turned on\nthat you go in and configure it.\n\n322\n00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:44.536\nBecause you'll see here some of those\ndefaults don't match up with what\n\n323\n00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:45.450\nyou would think.\n\n324\n00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:49.381\nSo let me show you, I'm gonna go back\nto my systems preferences screen.\n\n325\n00:16:49.381 --> 00:16:54.010\nAnd in system preferences I'm gonna\ngo into my app store preference.\n\n326\n00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:59.160\nNow, if this is your\nfirst time in El Capitan,\n\n327\n00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.820\nSierra, High Sierra, one of these newer\nversions, that might seem wired to you.\n\n328\n00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.259\nSystem updates used to\nbe under the Apple menu.\n\n329\n00:17:08.259 --> 00:17:10.188\nYou used to go to your Apple menu up top,\n\n330\n00:17:10.188 --> 00:17:13.987\nand then somewhere down here towards\nthe bottom you had software update, and\n\n331\n00:17:13.987 --> 00:17:16.790\nyou would choose that and\nyou would do your updates.\n\n332\n00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:22.340\nWell they moved it, I believe starting\nwith Mavericks if I remember right,\n\n333\n00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.560\nI think I could be off on that.\n\n334\n00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.450\nBut they moved it.\n\n335\n00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.590\nAnd now it's just part of the App Store,\nright?\n\n336\n00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.860\nThe App Store pulls the updates for\nmacOS anyway, right?\n\n337\n00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.040\nSo they just pull all\nthe updates from there now,\n\n338\n00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.320\nand that's why the preferences\nare tucked away into that.\n\n339\n00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.410\nSo, if I go into my App Store preferences,\n\n340\n00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:43.780\nthat's where I'm gonna see the settings\nthat affect automatic updates.\n\n341\n00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.540\nAnd I told you guys that it was\nautomatically enabled, it was turned on by\n\n342\n00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.480\ndefault, and if you look at these\nsettings, I did tell you the truth, right?\n\n343\n00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.750\nBut, these are not the settings\nthat I usually want.\n\n344\n00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.610\nI'm usually gonna come in here and\nchange these.\n\n345\n00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.620\nSo it says automatically check for\nupdates.\n\n346\n00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.050\nGreat, right?\n\n347\n00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.330\nIt says download newly available\nupdates in the background.\n\n348\n00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.490\nWonderful, it's gonna see an update's\navailable, it's gonna download it.\n\n349\n00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:13.010\nAnd then install system data files and\nsecurity updates.\n\n350\n00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.560\nOkay, what does that mean?\n\n351\n00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:20.470\nIf there's malware, if there's a virus, if\nthere's some kind of security exploit and\n\n352\n00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:25.010\nApple learns about it, they immediately\ncreate a fix and push it out.\n\n353\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:29.810\nYour system will check for\nupdates and find it, download it and\n\n354\n00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.040\nthen install it, right?\n\n355\n00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.490\nThat's great, that is what I\nwould consider the bare minimum.\n\n356\n00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.050\nIf you turn any of these off\nyou're putting yourself at risk.\n\n357\n00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.890\nBut Apple stops there,\nthey stop at the minimum, they don't\n\n358\n00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.120\nwant to go beyond that because they\ndon't know what your needs are, right?\n\n359\n00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:50.240\nBut these other two options, install\napp updates and install macOS updates.\n\n360\n00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.541\nThat means the third party applications\nwe install from the Mac App Store and\n\n361\n00:18:54.541 --> 00:18:59.170\nmacOs itself are not going to update,\nright?\n\n362\n00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:03.670\nSo only security fixes are being applied,\nand only security fixes for\n\n363\n00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:04.970\nthe operating system.\n\n364\n00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.240\nIf a security fix comes out for\n\n365\n00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.590\nsome app that I got from the App Store,\nit doesn't update automatically.\n\n366\n00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.990\nSo one of the first things I\nusually do is I come in here,\n\n367\n00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.440\nI just check both of these,\ndo it you found an update?\n\n368\n00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.000\nGreat, let's do it, apply the update, and\n\n369\n00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.410\nthat way I don't have\nto remember to do it.\n\n370\n00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.500\nYou come in in the morning and\n\n371\n00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.910\nyou'll have a little bubble up here in\nthe top right like a little notification.\n\n372\n00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.340\nIn fact I probably have one floating.\n\n373\n00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.010\nWell, no, I guess not.\n\n374\n00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.112\nWell, probably because I didn't\nhave those things checked.\n\n375\n00:19:32.112 --> 00:19:36.330\nBut, eventually it'll check and I'll get\na little pop up there and all you have to\n\n376\n00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.120\ndo is tell it to install or it will try\nto install in the middle of the night or\n\n377\n00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.230\nwhatever to keep your system up to date.\n\n378\n00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.710\nSo, you definitely want to tweak that,\nand then you can force the update,\n\n379\n00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:45.550\nif you want.\n\n380\n00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:48.410\nRight now it's telling me there are\nsoftware updates available for my system.\n\n381\n00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:53.261\nAnd if I choose show updates,\nit's gonna launch the Mac App Store,\n\n382\n00:19:53.261 --> 00:19:57.856\nand then under updates I can see\nright here that macOS High Sierra\n\n383\n00:19:57.856 --> 00:20:02.710\n10.13.3 supplemental update,\nwhich is an interesting one\n\n384\n00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:08.016\nbecause I am currently running,\nyeah, I thought so, 10.13.3.\n\n385\n00:20:08.016 --> 00:20:14.412\nSo something happened where they\nre-released the update to 10.13.3.\n\n386\n00:20:14.412 --> 00:20:19.292\nAnd now there's a new 10.13.3\nthat's replacing what I've got.\n\n387\n00:20:19.292 --> 00:20:22.100\nThat usually means there's some\nlittle bug that was interjected.\n\n388\n00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.563\nActually I think I know the story I\nthink I know the story on this one.\n\n389\n00:20:26.563 --> 00:20:30.347\nDepending on when you watch this show,\nit may be current news it may not be,\n\n390\n00:20:30.347 --> 00:20:34.150\nthe Spector in meltdown fixes that.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n391\n00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:34.940\n&gt;&gt; Big news items.\n\n392\n00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.670\nIntel kind of botched the update, and so\n\n393\n00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:41.280\nApple had to roll back\nsome of those fixes.\n\n394\n00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.170\nAnd now they're fixed, and so\nnow they're rolling them out again.\n\n395\n00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.434\nSo that's what the supplemental\nupdate will be.\n\n396\n00:20:46.434 --> 00:20:49.781\nIf you haven't heard of Spectrum meltdown,\ndon't worry about it but\n\n397\n00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:51.038\nit's all in history now.\n\n398\n00:20:51.038 --> 00:20:54.740\nBut there's an update, and so I can do it\nor it'll do the update on its own now.\n\n399\n00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:59.180\nSo definitely something you wanna tweak,\nso why, I did tell the truth, right?\n\n400\n00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.160\nThe automatic updating is\nturned down by default.\n\n401\n00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.700\nIt's not gonna update the whole OS,\n\n402\n00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.616\nand I do know some people who\nhate upgrading the whole OS.\n\n403\n00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:11.070\nLike macOS High Sierra had so\n\n404\n00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.600\nmany security adjustments in it,\nthat a lot of applications broke.\n\n405\n00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.670\nAnd so, there are plenty of people\nthat said you know what I'm gonna stay\n\n406\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.240\non Sierra, and I'm gonna wait a while so\nall the applications get updated.\n\n407\n00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.960\nAnd so for that you can just\nuncheck install macOS updates,\n\n408\n00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.020\nnow you have a little bit\nmore control over that.\n\n409\n00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:30.090\nBut just know if you're passing on\nupdates, usually there's some improvement,\n\n410\n00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.420\nquality of life improvements, that will\nmake you use your system better, and\n\n411\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.960\nyou'll typically want this.\n&gt;&gt; Don, I have some news for you.\n\n412\n00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.303\nI'm gonna be setting up\nabout 1,000 new Macs.\n\n413\n00:21:40.303 --> 00:21:43.099\n[LAUGH] So\nI have to repeat process over and\n\n414\n00:21:43.099 --> 00:21:44.268\nover again.\n\n415\n00:21:44.268 --> 00:21:45.600\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n416\n00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.480\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n417\n00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.710\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of up to you.\n\n418\n00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:54.590\nIf you are doing tons and tons of Macs,\nright, so let's say that you work for\n\n419\n00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:58.410\na university, and\nthey just set up a new computer lab.\n\n420\n00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:03.520\nThey ordered in 100 Macs and\nyou need to get them all set up, right?\n\n421\n00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.541\nYou don't wanna run through the initial\nconfiguration wizard a hundred\n\n422\n00:22:06.541 --> 00:22:07.203\ntimes.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n423\n00:22:07.203 --> 00:22:09.030\n&gt;&gt; Right, that would be crazy.\n\n424\n00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:13.580\nAnd even just using a USB key\ninstaller and going 100 times,\n\n425\n00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.830\nthat would be pretty tough.\n\n426\n00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:18.420\nSo no, you don't have to do that.\n\n427\n00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.760\nEverything that I've shown you,\n\n428\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.900\ncan actually be customized\nthrough what's called a profile.\n\n429\n00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.394\nWell, there are actually a few\ndifferent tools we could use.\n\n430\n00:22:24.394 --> 00:22:26.920\nThere's a system called net install, and\n\n431\n00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.100\nwith net install you can build\na custom installation image.\n\n432\n00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:36.186\nA custom installation image would have\nmacOS, any application that I wanted, and\n\n433\n00:22:36.186 --> 00:22:41.054\na bunch of security and system preferences\nset all as part of the default image so\n\n434\n00:22:41.054 --> 00:22:45.728\nthat when you install it, it's already\nset up the way that you want it to be.\n\n435\n00:22:45.728 --> 00:22:47.830\nThat's one option, right?\n\n436\n00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.450\nAnother option, though, is hey,\n\n437\n00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.910\nthe Macs, they ship with macOS\nalready installed on them.\n\n438\n00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.700\nSo it's not like I need to\ninstall macOS a hundred times.\n\n439\n00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.530\nI just need to apply my preferences,\nmy settings.\n\n440\n00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.430\nAll these little settings that I tweak.\n\n441\n00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:05.654\nWell, if it's just me, and I'm just\ngetting one laptop, I'll do it by hand.\n\n442\n00:23:05.654 --> 00:23:07.980\nI know my settings that I like.\n\n443\n00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.320\nSo I go through and I adjust things.\n\n444\n00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.240\nLike personally,\n\n445\n00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:16.410\nI've never gotten over having the hard\ndrive icon on my desktop, right?\n\n446\n00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:21.030\nIt was on the desktop for years and\nyears, back in the OS 9 days they had it.\n\n447\n00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:22.220\nIn OS 10 they had it for\n\n448\n00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.940\na little while, then they started\nturning it off by default.\n\n449\n00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.251\nI like to have the hard drive\nshowing up on my desktop, so\n\n450\n00:23:28.251 --> 00:23:30.862\nI go in and I change the option so\nit shows up.\n\n451\n00:23:30.862 --> 00:23:33.402\nThose are things that I know to do,\neasy enough.\n\n452\n00:23:33.402 --> 00:23:37.406\nBut if I've got 100 computers and\nI wanna know they're set up right,\n\n453\n00:23:37.406 --> 00:23:40.780\nApple has a product called\nthe Profile Manager.\n\n454\n00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.540\nProfile Manager is not included\nwith macOS by default.\n\n455\n00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.585\nYou have to go in the App Store and\nbuy what's called The Server App,\n\n456\n00:23:46.585 --> 00:23:47.554\nlet me show you here.\n\n457\n00:23:47.554 --> 00:23:48.970\nI'm gonna go into my App Store.\n\n458\n00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:54.139\nAnd I'm just gonna type\nserver into the search,\n\n459\n00:23:54.139 --> 00:23:57.301\nit's typically the first\nthing that comes up.\n\n460\n00:23:57.301 --> 00:24:02.073\nAnd once I run that search, there it is.\n\n461\n00:24:02.073 --> 00:24:05.961\nThis guy right here, where it says macOS\nServer, it's got an awesome two out of\n\n462\n00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:08.844\nfive star rating.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n463\n00:24:08.844 --> 00:24:10.969\n&gt;&gt; I will say, the macOS Server app,\n\n464\n00:24:10.969 --> 00:24:12.808\nit's actually really good.\n\n465\n00:24:12.808 --> 00:24:17.436\nThe problem is Apple sometimes\nmakes things a little too easy.\n\n466\n00:24:17.436 --> 00:24:22.130\nAnd you just get any average Joe thinks\nthey can stand up a server and run it.\n\n467\n00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:26.940\nAnd if you're used to a Mac, everything's\nGUI-based, it's so easy to use.\n\n468\n00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.460\nBut you get into the server,\nthere's no hand holding.\n\n469\n00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.100\nYou have to know what you're doing.\n\n470\n00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.120\nAnd so it gets bad ratings, but\nit's really not the server's fault.\n\n471\n00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.101\nBut it costs a whopping $20.\n&gt;&gt; 20 bucks.\n\n472\n00:24:38.101 --> 00:24:39.520\n&gt;&gt; Pretty inexpensive.\n\n473\n00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.180\nAnd it's tied to your Apple ID, so\nonce you buy it, you can install it on\n\n474\n00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.930\nthey say up to five or six Mac's, whatever\nit is, it's part of the family sharing.\n\n475\n00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.750\nSo you can cover many machines with it.\n\n476\n00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.402\nAnd once you install that app,\n\n477\n00:24:53.402 --> 00:24:58.094\nit gives you the ability to\nset up the Profile Manager,\n\n478\n00:24:58.094 --> 00:25:02.830\nwhich here,\nthat little screenshot is kinda blurry.\n\n479\n00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.110\nI've got it installed it\nhere on my actual laptop.\n\n480\n00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.970\nAnd one of the things that you can do\nwith the Profile Manager is you can\n\n481\n00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:14.790\ncreate a profile which is a list\nof settings or preferences.\n\n482\n00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:17.365\nSo I can figure out what\nare all the settings and\n\n483\n00:25:17.365 --> 00:25:19.752\npreferences that I want on these new Macs.\n\n484\n00:25:19.752 --> 00:25:23.480\nAnd I can come to and define each and\neveryone of them, and\n\n485\n00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:28.543\nonce their defined, this can generate\nwhat's called a mobile config file.\n\n486\n00:25:28.543 --> 00:25:32.645\nNow mobile config file is just a simple\nlittle file, you can put it on a USB key.\n\n487\n00:25:32.645 --> 00:25:37.380\nYou can take that USB key to each machine,\nand you just double-click on that file.\n\n488\n00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.661\nOr you can even have\nthe file on the network and\n\n489\n00:25:38.661 --> 00:25:40.330\nyou just browse over the network and\ndouble-click on it.\n\n490\n00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.870\nAnd when you double-click on it,\nit will install and\n\n491\n00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.090\nset all of those preferences at once.\n\n492\n00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:51.948\nSo if you have a standard wallpaper you\nwant, a screensaver or lockout time,\n\n493\n00:25:51.948 --> 00:25:55.610\nyou want to enable FileVault,\nall these you wanna do you,\n\n494\n00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.880\nyou can build them all into that profile.\n\n495\n00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.890\nAnd then save that as a file and\ndeploy it somewhere else.\n\n496\n00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.860\nThe Profile Manager lets you do that, and\n\n497\n00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:10.020\nwhile we don't cover it here in this show,\nwe actually have some server content.\n\n498\n00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.480\nIf you're an ITProTV subscriber,\nyou have access to our whole library, and\n\n499\n00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.420\nwe have the server content\nin a special show.\n\n500\n00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:21.660\nApple used to have a separate ACSP\ncertification that was just for Server.\n\n501\n00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.950\nAnd they ended it for some reason.\n\n502\n00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.420\nI don't know why exactly.\n\n503\n00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.350\nBut the Server product is still\nthe best way to go about pushing\n\n504\n00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.420\nout these settings.\n\n505\n00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.470\nSo definitely worth a look if you're\ndealing with large quantities of Macs.\n\n506\n00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.060\n&gt;&gt; Initial configuration part two.\n\n507\n00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.470\nMake sure you see part one.\n\n508\n00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.600\nVery important, great information.\n\n509\n00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.050\nWell done as usual, Don.\n\n510\n00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:44.210\nBut before we move away into another\nsubject which I know there are more,\n\n511\n00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:47.943\nanything else you would like to say?\n&gt;&gt; One thing I forgot to mention about\n\n512\n00:26:47.943 --> 00:26:52.388\nthe Profile Manager, it's a great way to\nget an initial set of preferences set\n\n513\n00:26:52.388 --> 00:26:56.653\nup on a machine, but it can also be\nconfigured to maintain those settings.\n\n514\n00:26:56.653 --> 00:27:00.305\nMaybe you want an enforced desktop on\nall your machines, like a wallpaper,\n\n515\n00:27:00.305 --> 00:27:03.627\nwhat's to stop a student from coming\nin and changing the wallpaper?\n\n516\n00:27:03.627 --> 00:27:05.881\nThat's a user preference, you don't\nhave to be an administrator for that.\n\n517\n00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:09.172\nWell, they can do it and the Profile\nManager will put it right back.\n\n518\n00:27:09.172 --> 00:27:11.544\nSo it's a great way to\nenforce those settings,\n\n519\n00:27:11.544 --> 00:27:13.925\nnot just to put them in\nplace in the first place.\n\n520\n00:27:13.925 --> 00:27:17.355\nSo definitely something you wanna look at\nif you're working on this in a business,\n\n521\n00:27:17.355 --> 00:27:20.062\nschool, enterprise type environment,\nreally, really good.\n\n522\n00:27:20.062 --> 00:27:21.496\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, well, once again,\n\n523\n00:27:21.496 --> 00:27:24.162\ninitial configuration parts one and\ntwo, see them both, and\n\n524\n00:27:24.162 --> 00:27:27.750\nsee everything inside of the Apple\nCertified Support Professional series.\n\n525\n00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.920\nDon's done a wonderful job\nputting that together for you.\n\n526\n00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.660\nYou'll be glad you did, and\nyou'll be in the course library where\n\n527\n00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:37.460\nthere's thousands of other videos,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n528\n00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.921\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n529\n00:27:39.921 --> 00:27:41.580\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n530\n00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.540\nThanks for watching.\n\n531\n00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.400\nI'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n532\n00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.838\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again, soon.\n\n533\n00:27:46.838 --> 00:27:52.730\n[MUSIC]\n\n534\n00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:56.148\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

--> 00:00:08.277\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:11.928\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:13.011\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:16.055\nwatching ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:17.355\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\n\n8\n00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:20.605\nas we continue on with\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n9\n00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:23.562\nManaging User Accounts is\nthe title of this episode,\n\n10\n00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:25.937\nas we move merrily forward with Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:25.937 --> 00:00:27.086\nDon, great to have you here again.\n\n12\n00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:27.930\nThanks very much.\n\n13\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.645\n&gt;&gt; And I am ready to be one\nof Robin Hood's merry men.\n\n14\n00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:31.485\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And-\n\n15\n00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:32.931\n&gt;&gt; We're men, we're men in tights.\n\n16\n00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:33.475\nNo, we're not doing that.\n\n17\n00:00:33.475 --> 00:00:34.097\n[CROSSTALK] I'm sorry.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:36.625\nWe have the ITProTV dress code.\n\n19\n00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:39.320\nWe'll be jumping into User Accounts.\n\n20\n00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.360\nNow, if you've seen all our episodes you\nknow that we actually did set up a user\n\n21\n00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.710\naccount during the initial\nconfiguration of our Mac.\n\n22\n00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.243\nBut that doesn't have to be\nthe only user account we use.\n\n23\n00:00:48.243 --> 00:00:50.030\nIn fact,\nwe can create custom user accounts and\n\n24\n00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.820\ndo all sorts of crazy things with them.\n\n25\n00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.180\nWe're gonna take a look at that\nright here in this episode.\n\n26\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.000\n&gt;&gt; So what tool do we use to\nmanage user accounts, Don?\n\n27\n00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.230\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthere is the initial Configuration Wizard.\n\n28\n00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.150\nBut that just creates one account.\n\n29\n00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.200\nAnd it doesn't give you\na whole lot of options.\n\n30\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.740\nFirst name.\n\n31\n00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.060\nLast name.\nPassword.\n\n32\n00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.640\nAnd it automatically makes\nthat account an administrator.\n\n33\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.178\nSo that's not really the tool we're\ngoing to use when it comes to\n\n34\n00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:12.670\nworking with user accounts.\n\n35\n00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.310\nInstead, we actually have a system\npreference that we can use that let's us\n\n36\n00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.510\ncreate users in groups.\n\n37\n00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.840\nLet me bring that up here.\n\n38\n00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.690\nIf we go in to Apple menu on top,\nwe can jump into our System Preferences.\n\n39\n00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.770\nAnd we can try again to get\ninto our System Preferences.\n\n40\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.680\nThere we go.\n\n41\n00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.350\nAnd in the System Preferences,\nyou can hang around a bit\n\n42\n00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.100\nan you can see here there's two little\nsilhouettes, for users and groups.\n\n43\n00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.060\nAnd that's the primary tool that we're\ngonna use when it comes to working\n\n44\n00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.600\nwith users.\n\n45\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.270\nNow, if you just did a fresh install,\nit's going to look something like this.\n\n46\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.890\nThere might be some little variations\nlike the icon that it picked for\n\n47\n00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.020\nmy account, it just randomly picked\nthat from the default set of images.\n\n48\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.130\nI ended up with a violin or\nviola or something.\n\n49\n00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.295\nI don't know what that is.\n\n50\n00:01:56.295 --> 00:01:59.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You might have an owl or a sunflower.\n\n51\n00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.690\n&gt;&gt; A small furry creature.\n\n52\n00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.710\n&gt;&gt; There are number of\ncrazy icons in there.\n\n53\n00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.270\nYou also may or may not see this\nguest user account turned on or off.\n\n54\n00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.790\nI'll talk more about that\none a little bit later.\n\n55\n00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.890\nBut from here, I can see my account,\nand I can come in, and\n\n56\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.320\nI can change my password, I can change\nthe icon, I can make modifications.\n\n57\n00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.760\nNow, by default, I actually can't\nmake too many modifications.\n\n58\n00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.840\nI can only modify my account.\n\n59\n00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.930\nI can't modify any other accounts.\n\n60\n00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.130\nYou'll notice a little lock\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n61\n00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.390\nThat if you're an administrator, you can\nunlock this screen by clicking on that and\n\n62\n00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.730\ntyping in your password,\nand when you do that,\n\n63\n00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.010\nnow you'll have the full features to\nbe able to go in here and modify this.\n\n64\n00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.710\nA regular user can only\nmodify their settings.\n\n65\n00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.060\nAnd so, that's what you see by default.\n\n66\n00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.960\nYou can modify your own settings,\nbut an administrator can unlock, and\n\n67\n00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.700\nnow they have full access to everything.\n\n68\n00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.150\nSo most of the screen didn't really\nchange, what changed was the list over on\n\n69\n00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.870\nthe left side, the grayed out\naccounts are now in a bolder black.\n\n70\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.650\nWhich means I can go in and\nmodify and change them.\n\n71\n00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.530\nBut this is the primary tool that\nwe're gonna be using to go in and\n\n72\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.860\nmodify our user accounts, their\nattributes, their settings, and so forth.\n\n73\n00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.230\nIt's all right kind of tied in here.\n\n74\n00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.950\nSo if I don't like that icon,\nI can edit that.\n\n75\n00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.520\nAnd I can pick from a number of defaults\nor pick my own photo or whatever, right?\n\n76\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.750\nSo we can-\n&gt;&gt; Picture of the cat.\n\n77\n00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.258\n&gt;&gt; Do you see a cat?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n78\n00:03:24.258 --> 00:03:25.635\n[LAUGH]\n\n79\n00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:27.350\n&gt;&gt; I was going to pick a cat.\n\n80\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.120\nWe will do a zebra.\n\n81\n00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.770\nYou know what?\n\n82\n00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.640\nWe should go all American.\n\n83\n00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.578\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n84\n00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:37.170\nSay I'm an eagle, so I'll pick the eagle\nthere and, an eagle it's great.\n\n85\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.450\nI can change my password,\nunder login items,\n\n86\n00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.930\nI can change what programs\nlaunch when I first log in.\n\n87\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.300\nMaybe every time I log in, I know I'm\ngonna run Safari and browse the web, so\n\n88\n00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.220\nI can add that to my list and say, hey,\nwhen I log in go ahead and run Safari.\n\n89\n00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.850\nYou just go ahead and find it,\nit'll be in here somewhere, right?\n\n90\n00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.720\nWhoops, that's Siri, I don't want her\nto bother me every time I log in.\n\n91\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.302\n&gt;&gt; Not all the time.\n\n92\n00:03:59.302 --> 00:04:03.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, I'll punch in Safari,\nand now every time I log in,\n\n93\n00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.690\nSafari is going to launch.\n\n94\n00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.360\nThat's custom to my account.\n\n95\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.080\nSo simple changes like these\nare all done from right here.\n\n96\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.370\nNot a whole lot that we have to tweak or\ncustomize.\n\n97\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.310\nBut, we get it set up,\nwe customize it the way we want, and\n\n98\n00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.370\nthat's the tool we're gonna use.\n\n99\n00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.870\n&gt;&gt; So, Don,\nare all user accounts treated the same?\n\n100\n00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.520\nAll right, user accounts\nare not all treated the same.\n\n101\n00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.890\nAnd I kind of mentioned already\nthat the account that I've got,\n\n102\n00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.270\nthat was done by the Initial Configuration\nWizard has me flagged as an Admin, right?\n\n103\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.550\nAn Admin is a special type of account,\n\n104\n00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.965\nthere's actually five\ndifferent types of accounts.\n\n105\n00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:35.880\nAnd Admin is one of them, right?\n\n106\n00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.120\nThere's also regular users, there's\nguest users, like you see right there.\n\n107\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.620\nThere's regular users with parental\ncontrols and then there's groups.\n\n108\n00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.270\nRight, five different types of users.\n\n109\n00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.860\nAnd each one kind of does something\na little bit different, right?\n\n110\n00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.860\nSo an Administrator.\n\n111\n00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.140\nAn Administrator can do\nanything they want, right?\n\n112\n00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.250\nThey have full access to the machine\nto modify settings and make changes.\n\n113\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.100\nLet's say I wanna share\nmy computer with Zach.\n\n114\n00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.480\nSo I wanna give Zach a user account,\nright?\n\n115\n00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.620\nI don't want him messing\nwith system settings, right?\n\n116\n00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.420\nHe can use the computer, but\nI don't want him messing with\n\n117\n00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.860\nlike the file vault encryption or things\nlike that, I wanna keep that stuff safe.\n\n118\n00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.930\nSo I can add an account for him,\nI'll hit the little plus sign down here.\n\n119\n00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.060\nAnd when I add an account for\nZach, I can pick.\n\n120\n00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.020\nDo I want him to be an administrator?\n\n121\n00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.110\nA standard user?\n\n122\n00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.590\nA standard user that's managed\nwith parental controls?\n\n123\n00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.140\nA sharing-only user?\n\n124\n00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.170\nOr a group?\n\n125\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.410\nOkay, so what are each of these?\n\n126\n00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.200\nWell, a standard user.\n\n127\n00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.650\nThat means they can log in on the system.\n\n128\n00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.330\nThey had their own settings,\nthey can install software just for them.\n\n129\n00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.240\nAnd they can change the wallpaper\nthat just affects them.\n\n130\n00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.480\nBut they can't do things\nlike changing the hardware,\n\n131\n00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.860\nor doing a system update,\nturning on file vault encryption.\n\n132\n00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.700\nThat stuff is protected, you have\nto be an administrator to do that.\n\n133\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.600\nThis would be a regular user.\n\n134\n00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.705\nSo I can punch in an account here for\n\n135\n00:06:01.705 --> 00:06:07.310\nZach and\nonce I've got that account created,\n\n136\n00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.390\nI can give an account to him and like say,\nhey, here's your username and password.\n\n137\n00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.560\nHe can walk up, he can log in,\nand have that access.\n\n138\n00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.170\nBut whenever you see a lock like this,\nif he clicks to unlock it,\n\n139\n00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.430\nyou would have to put in an administrative\npassword which he doesn't have.\n\n140\n00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.480\nSo that's a protected account.\n\n141\n00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.940\nBut the settings inside\nare pretty much the same, right?\n\n142\n00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.010\nWell, I've got where I can reset\nthe password, we see his account,\n\n143\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.180\nI can change his icon, if I want.\n\n144\n00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.550\nI can't do the start up items, right?\n\n145\n00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.110\nHe can when he logs in,\nhe can modify his own startup items.\n\n146\n00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.990\nBut I can't modify his start up items.\n\n147\n00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.220\nNow, why is that?\n\n148\n00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.950\nI'm a malicious user.\n\n149\n00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.560\nI can make all sorts of crazy\nthings run when he logs in.\n\n150\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.430\nSo they don't give us that option\nright here by default, but\n\n151\n00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.590\nthe rest of it's pretty much the same.\n\n152\n00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.770\nNow, I made him a standard user.\n\n153\n00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.935\nI mentioned there was a standard user\nthat's managed with parental controls,\n\n154\n00:06:55.935 --> 00:06:56.610\nright?\n\n155\n00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.070\nIf I add another user, so\nlet's say another one of our hosts.\n\n156\n00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.140\nMaybe I want to allow\nRonnie to use my computer.\n\n157\n00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.480\nSo I'm gonna create an account for\nRonnie Wong.\n\n158\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.620\nAnd when it sets up, by default,\nit's doing that standard user.\n\n159\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.330\nWell, I want him to be managing\nparental controls, right?\n\n160\n00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.133\nParental controls are a set of\nrestrictions we can use to control what\n\n161\n00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:18.060\nthey access.\n\n162\n00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.640\nAnd when I choose that\nmanagement of parental controls,\n\n163\n00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.870\nthe screen changes a little bit, right?\n\n164\n00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.620\nNow, it's asking me, how old is Ronnie?\n\n165\n00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.420\nAnd that's because Apple has some\ndefault settings that apply that\n\n166\n00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.560\nare customized by age.\n\n167\n00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.535\nSo if I say that he is four and up, right?\n\n168\n00:07:35.535 --> 00:07:38.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's going to limit him.\n\n169\n00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.060\nSo that when he goes into the app store,\n\n170\n00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.000\nhe can only install apps that\nare rated ages four and up, right?\n\n171\n00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.500\nSo if there is an app\nthat is rated seven and\n\n172\n00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.670\nup, he won't be able to install that,\nright?\n\n173\n00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.870\nSo those are the restrictions.\n\n174\n00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.778\nSame thing with Safari, the web browser,\n\n175\n00:07:51.778 --> 00:07:54.487\nit'll have limitations that\nare also applied based on age.\n\n176\n00:07:54.487 --> 00:07:57.855\nAnd we can modify that age,\nI'll say that his 12 and up, right?\n\n177\n00:07:57.855 --> 00:07:58.431\nSo punch that in.\n\n178\n00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:01.380\nRonnie is actually I\nthink older than I am.\n\n179\n00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.155\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; He's older than four.\n\n180\n00:08:02.155 --> 00:08:05.430\n&gt;&gt; So I will punch that in.\n\n181\n00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.060\nI will hit create user, and\nnow we'll have this new user.\n\n182\n00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.180\nThere he is.\n\n183\n00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.870\nAnd want me to verify.\n\n184\n00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:14.840\nThere we go.\n\n185\n00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.750\nAnd there's Ronnie Wong.\n\n186\n00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.450\nNow, notice how Zach shows as Standard,\nand Ronnie shows as Managed.\n\n187\n00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.570\nOkay, that managed part,\nthat's just the parental controls.\n\n188\n00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.190\nSee this little check mark down here\nwhere it says Enable parental controls?\n\n189\n00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.460\nThat's the only difference.\n\n190\n00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:34.080\nIf I went to Zach's account, and\nI checked Enable parental controls.\n\n191\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.295\nSo you change to manage, right?\n\n192\n00:08:35.295 --> 00:08:38.620\nBut a standard user is a standard user.\n\n193\n00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.400\nNo matter what you do to it.\n\n194\n00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.420\nBut if you Enable parental controls it\njust shows up a little bit different.\n\n195\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.660\nSo while Apple on the exam refers\nto it as a separate account type,\n\n196\n00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.500\nit's actually not.\n\n197\n00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.470\nIt's just a standard user.\n\n198\n00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.530\nBut it has these extra settings, right?\n\n199\n00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.890\nSo I have shown you admin.\n\n200\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:56.140\nI have shown you standard user, and I've\nshown you a manage your parental controls,\n\n201\n00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.280\nso that's the first, honestly,\nthe three that you use the most.\n\n202\n00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.240\nThere is another one called\na sharing-only user.\n\n203\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.080\nThis is a user who you don't want to\nbe able to walk up to your computer and\n\n204\n00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.810\nlogin, right?\n\n205\n00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:15.220\nSo if I take a, we'll pick another host,\nwe'll do Mike Rodrick, all right.\n\n206\n00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.140\nSo take Mike, I want Mike\n\n207\n00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.790\nto be able to browse across the network\nto access shared folders on my system.\n\n208\n00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.540\nI don't want to sit down in my system and\nuse it.\n\n209\n00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.080\nBut I want him to access some folders or\nprinters that I might have shared.\n\n210\n00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:35.090\nSo for him, I can come up here and\nI can say, I want him to be sharing only.\n\n211\n00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.070\nNow a sharing only user,\nis different than a regular user.\n\n212\n00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.690\nBecause this one will not be\nable to change the wallpaper, or\n\n213\n00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:47.280\nother things, can't even log in,\non the machine itself at least.\n\n214\n00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.070\nBut he can come in over the network,\nand access the shared folder.\n\n215\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.020\nApparently, I can't type\nthe same password twice, but\n\n216\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:58.700\nif I can, we can create that account and\nwe'll see that he shows up, and\n\n217\n00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.040\nthen he'll show up as a sharing\nonly account right there.\n\n218\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.790\nAnd he has a little icon but\nnotice the big difference.\n\n219\n00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.090\nThere's no other settings.\n\n220\n00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.850\nI can't turn on parental controls, because\nhe can't even login in the first place.\n\n221\n00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.460\nThere's no start up or launch items,\nbecause he never logs in.\n\n222\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.160\nSo none of those settings apply.\n\n223\n00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.850\nSo we just see a much more\nnarrow scope of options.\n\n224\n00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:23.360\nI can change his icon, which,\nI gave him a pink flower which he probably\n\n225\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.570\nwouldn't approve of-\n&gt;&gt; He enjoys pink flowers.\n\n226\n00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.530\n&gt;&gt; If it were up to him, he'd pick Batman.\n\n227\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.510\n&gt;&gt; Or a gingerbread man.\n\n228\n00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.980\n&gt;&gt; We don't have a Batman,\nyeah gingerbread,\n\n229\n00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.390\nall right, we can go with that.\n\n230\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.350\nSo, we'll give him that one.\n\n231\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.240\nI can reset his password.\n\n232\n00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.820\nThat's it, that's all you can set here.\n\n233\n00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.140\nBut now, when I share out a folder,\nI can grant him access, and\n\n234\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.880\nhe'll be able to access\nit over the network.\n\n235\n00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.250\nNow the last type of user account\nisn’t a user account at all.\n\n236\n00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:50.700\nIt’s a group, and what a group is,\nis a collection of user accounts.\n\n237\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.205\nAnd we’re gonna talk about\npermissions in another episode, but\n\n238\n00:10:54.205 --> 00:10:58.820\nwhen you assign permissions, it’s always\nbetter to assign them to a group.\n\n239\n00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.680\nAnd then, I can just put people in\nthe group, and they'll get access to\n\n240\n00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.520\nsomething, and I can take people out\nof the group and they don't get access.\n\n241\n00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.960\nEach user has a group created for\ntheir public folder.\n\n242\n00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.260\nEvery user has a public folder they\nshare by default, and you can pick and\n\n243\n00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.830\nchoose who has access to it, right?\n\n244\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.230\nSo if I want Zach to access my public\nfolder, I can come in here and\n\n245\n00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.180\ncheck that off, right?\n\n246\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.500\nNow I don't actually have to do that,\n\n247\n00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.620\ncuz down here I can see the everyone\ngroup has access to my public folder.\n\n248\n00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.836\nBut maybe I don't want that,\nI'm gonna turn that off and\n\n249\n00:11:28.836 --> 00:11:33.067\nnow I'm gonna give Mike and Zach access\nto my folder, not Ronnie, right?\n\n250\n00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:36.161\nAnd now they'll be able to access that\nfolder, and I can start to pick and\n\n251\n00:11:36.161 --> 00:11:37.420\nchoose it, right?\n\n252\n00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.710\nSo these groups help to facilitate that.\n\n253\n00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.530\nSo right here in this\nscreen we saw admin users,\n\n254\n00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.650\nstandard users,\nmanage of parental controls users.\n\n255\n00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.870\nWe saw, sharing only users, and groups.\n\n256\n00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.930\nThose are the five types of accounts\nthat we see right inside of this tool.\n\n257\n00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.810\nDon, where do iCloud accounts\nfit into all of this?\n\n258\n00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.300\n&gt;&gt; iCloud, that would be like a sixth type\nof account, but you don't see it here.\n\n259\n00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.250\nAnd the reason is that the iCloud account\nactually attaches to your local account.\n\n260\n00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.070\nThe iCloud account exists\non Apple's servers, right?\n\n261\n00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.260\nSo it's out there on the Internet,\nit doesn't exist here on this machine.\n\n262\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.640\nBut a user can link to iCloud.\n\n263\n00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.160\nWhen I choose my account and\nI look at it here,\n\n264\n00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.440\nI don't really see anything that\neven mentions iCloud, right?\n\n265\n00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.180\nSo this tool has been around a long time,\nsince before iCloud.\n\n266\n00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.900\nAnd so we don't really see that linkage,\nbut if I go back into system preferences\n\n267\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.940\nand I go to iCloud, here I can\nchoose to sign in with my Apple ID.\n\n268\n00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:42.390\nNow if I do that, it's going to link my\niCloud account with my local account here.\n\n269\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.960\nNow, I have a local account that\nwas called Don Pezet, right?\n\n270\n00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.030\nAnd I set a password,\nwhich I'll give it away here.\n\n271\n00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.110\nI just did the word password.\n\n272\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.790\nAll lower case.\n\n273\n00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.840\nNot a very secure password.\n\n274\n00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.410\nBut when I link my iCloud account,\nit's tied to an email address, right?\n\n275\n00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:01.750\nAnd I have a secure password and all sorts\nstuff like that, that's finding good.\n\n276\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.400\nIt will link the two together, so\n\n277\n00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.910\nthat when I log in with my local\naccount I'm also connected to iCloud.\n\n278\n00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.840\nSo it's up to the user to do this though,\n\n279\n00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.620\nas an administrator I can't add other\npeople's iCloud accounts to the system.\n\n280\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.450\nSo I log in with my local account,\nand then I come here and\n\n281\n00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.290\nI log in with that iCloud account.\n\n282\n00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.300\nSo I'll punch in my account and\naddress, and\n\n283\n00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.900\nI'll punch in my password\nif I can remember it.\n\n284\n00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.330\nLet's see how this goes.\n\n285\n00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.240\nAnd you'll notice that I use a slightly\nlonger password than just the word\n\n286\n00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:37.150\npassword all lower case, and, I got an\nerror connecting to the Apple ID server.\n\n287\n00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.510\nLittle thing about iCloud.\n\n288\n00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.853\nIt only works if you're\nconnected to the network.\n\n289\n00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:44.110\nAll right, so\nif you can bear with me just a moment.\n\n290\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:48.410\nI'm gonna go in here and\nconnect to our wireless network, and\n\n291\n00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.645\nmaybe I can type the password\nright this time.\n\n292\n00:13:51.645 --> 00:13:55.010\nI typed it wrong in the earlier,\nwhich is why I'm not connected.\n\n293\n00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.110\nBut once I'm connected,\nthen I can jump back here and\n\n294\n00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.780\nactually get iCloud up there it is,\nit's connecting now.\n\n295\n00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:06.170\nSo let me punch in my super long password,\nand once I've\n\n296\n00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:10.170\ngot this it's gonna reach out, it's gonna\nauthenticate me against Apple's servers.\n\n297\n00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.290\nAnd once I'm authenticated, then it\nwill connect my local account to my own.\n\n298\n00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.940\nNow, I have dual factor authentication on,\nI mentioned that, so\n\n299\n00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.740\nI've got to do an extra\nauthentication step,\n\n300\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.340\nwhich is it's gonna send me\na text message on my phone.\n\n301\n00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.750\nYou may or may not have this feature\nturned on, but it's kinda neat because-\n\n302\n00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.030\n&gt;&gt; It's true, due to factor.\n\n303\n00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if somebody were to try and\nbreak in to my account or\n\n304\n00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.690\nwhatever, they wouldn't be able\nto unless they have this code.\n\n305\n00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.210\nSo I just have to wait a moment\nthat will get text to my phone.\n\n306\n00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.170\nOnce I've cleared that though,\nit links the two.\n\n307\n00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.920\nAnd what does that mean, right?\n\n308\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.860\nWell, it means that when\nI log into my computer,\n\n309\n00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.910\nyes I'm logging in with a local account,\nright?\n\n310\n00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.610\nBut, if I forget my password?\n\n311\n00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.340\nWell, I could go to the iCloud site and\nI could reset my password.\n\n312\n00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.930\nOr I could try and log in and\nactually use my iCloud username and\n\n313\n00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.350\npassword to reset my local account.\n\n314\n00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.820\nYou have a little bit more flexibility,\nand my settings and\n\n315\n00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.570\nfeatures get synced up to\nthe iCloud where they're available.\n\n316\n00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.850\nSo that's kind of a neat feature to have.\n\n317\n00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.800\nAnd I'm sitting here waiting on this\ntext message, and it's still not here.\n\n318\n00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.615\nIt will come eventually.\n\n319\n00:15:14.615 --> 00:15:16.207\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But let's move on and\n\n320\n00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.410\nI'll get that sooner or later.\n\n321\n00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.200\nWe're gonna see the iCloud\nagain in a later episode.\n\n322\n00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.000\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n323\n00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.480\n&gt;&gt; But for now, know that iCloud is\ntechnically a separate user account.\n\n324\n00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.200\nIt's not the same as your local account.\n\n325\n00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.220\nThey get linked together,\nbut they are separate.\n\n326\n00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.380\nThey have different passwords.\n\n327\n00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.020\nSo if you're like me and you have\na really long iCloud password, and\n\n328\n00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.190\nyou log in with your email address,\nyou log into the computer with your\n\n329\n00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.950\nregular user name and your regular\npassword, which may be easier.\n\n330\n00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.130\nHeck, you might even have\nautomatic log in turned on.\n\n331\n00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:47.240\nYou wouldn't want that with iCloud,\nbut with your local account, you may.\n\n332\n00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.680\nSo that is a difference,\n\n333\n00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.750\nso going back to Zach's question\nwhere is iCloud would fit in?\n\n334\n00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:56.520\nWell, iCloud is connected, but\nit's separate it's not the same thing.\n\n335\n00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.280\n&gt;&gt; Am I hearing your phone vibrating?\n\n336\n00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.046\nIs it going off?\n\n337\n00:15:59.046 --> 00:16:00.109\n&gt;&gt; I kinda become numb to this.\n\n338\n00:16:00.109 --> 00:16:01.367\nYeah, actually is.\n\n339\n00:16:01.367 --> 00:16:02.935\nSo let's jump back in here.\n\n340\n00:16:02.935 --> 00:16:06.155\nAnd sometimes it can take a little while.\n\n341\n00:16:06.155 --> 00:16:08.647\nMy code is 5182.\n\n342\n00:16:08.647 --> 00:16:11.010\nAnd you might say to yourself,\nwait a minute.\n\n343\n00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:12.770\nDon, you're telling me your code.\n\n344\n00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:13.850\nCode can only be used once.\n\n345\n00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.360\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; And it's only valid for-\n\n346\n00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.100\n&gt;&gt; Limited time.\n\n347\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.830\n&gt;&gt; I think it's 15 minutes.\n\n348\n00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.580\nIt's not valid for a terribly long time.\n\n349\n00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.590\nBut once you punch that in there,\nand I guess I'll be responsible and\n\n350\n00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:25.170\nput my phone away instead of using\nmy phone in the middle of a show.\n\n351\n00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.150\nSo there it's telling me my Apple security\nhas been updated, so that's good.\n\n352\n00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.840\nI can say that I'm done, and\n\n353\n00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.653\nnow it's connecting my local\naccount with the iCloud account.\n\n354\n00:16:33.653 --> 00:16:35.081\nActually it's doing it\nthe other way around,\n\n355\n00:16:35.081 --> 00:16:37.300\njust connecting the iCloud\naccount to my local account.\n\n356\n00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.880\nBecause at Apple headquarters, they don't\nreally know about my local account.\n\n357\n00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.380\nThey just know about the iCloud account.\n\n358\n00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.900\nBut on this computer it knows about both.\n\n359\n00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.560\nIt knows the local and\nit knows the iCloud one.\n\n360\n00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.990\nNow to finish the linkage,\n\n361\n00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.860\nit's requiring me to present my\nlocal user account password again.\n\n362\n00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Not my iCloud password.\n\n363\n00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.550\nIt's important you don't mix these up.\n\n364\n00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.709\nSee how it says enter your Mac password.\n\n365\n00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:04.350\nAnd that's what's gonna actually\nconnect these two things together.\n\n366\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:06.660\nSo I'll punch in that password and hit OK.\n\n367\n00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.392\nIt's gonna connect them together and\n\n368\n00:17:08.392 --> 00:17:11.877\nthen it's gonna show me some of the other\niCloud data that I can pick from.\n\n369\n00:17:11.877 --> 00:17:12.610\nAnd I forgot about this one.\n\n370\n00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:16.440\nI also have another pass code.\n\n371\n00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.170\nSecurity on a Cloud account\nis really important.\n\n372\n00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:23.460\nAnd for me, my content is put in all\nthese videos and people see my account so\n\n373\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.220\nI have extra security turned on.\n\n374\n00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:31.610\nSo I have a PIN that I've gotta punch\nin here, which I should remember.\n\n375\n00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.050\nYou only have to do this when\nyou connect the first time so\n\n376\n00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.140\nit's easy to forget these.\n\n377\n00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.070\nAnd if you forget them, it's a bit\nof a challenge to recover your data.\n\n378\n00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.550\nSo you wanna make sure you remember that.\n\n379\n00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.100\nBut once I punch in that, there we go.\n\n380\n00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.910\nNow we're ready to connect and\nenable some features, right?\n\n381\n00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:46.920\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n382\n00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.300\n&gt;&gt; iCloud is packed full of features,\nso by linking it,\n\n383\n00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.840\nit's already telling me here that it's\ngonna connect my documents and data,\n\n384\n00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.060\nfind my Mac, right, so\nit's turning these things on.\n\n385\n00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.715\nAnd as I move forward,\nit's going to say hey,\n\n386\n00:17:59.715 --> 00:18:03.475\nif you can do Find My Mac we gotta\nfind the location of your device.\n\n387\n00:18:03.475 --> 00:18:05.220\nWe've got to turn that service on.\n\n388\n00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.570\nAnd then it starts to show all of\nthe different services that it's finding\n\n389\n00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:09.440\nand connecting.\n\n390\n00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.995\nWe're now connected to iCloud.\n\n391\n00:18:10.995 --> 00:18:12.920\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\ndoes that change the local account?\n\n392\n00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.046\nI mean, how does the local account\nlook now that it's attached on iCloud?\n\n393\n00:18:16.046 --> 00:18:17.708\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so as I mentioned,\n\n394\n00:18:17.708 --> 00:18:18.790\nthey're linked together.\n\n395\n00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.480\nAnd some changes do happen,\nit's not really all that significant.\n\n396\n00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.870\nI mean,\non this screen if we pull it back up,\n\n397\n00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.690\nyou can see where it's\nconnected to the iCloud.\n\n398\n00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.330\nAnd hey, look, it found my picture.\n\n399\n00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.250\n&gt;&gt; Hey.\n\n400\n00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.590\n&gt;&gt; It didn't have a picture a minute ago.\n\n401\n00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:30.970\nThat came from iCloud, right?\n\n402\n00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.490\nBut that's my iCloud account.\n\n403\n00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:38.359\nIf I go back to the Users and Groups\nsystem preference, when I come in here and\n\n404\n00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:41.188\nI pull it up, I'm still Sam Eagle, right?\n\n405\n00:18:41.188 --> 00:18:44.210\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you are.\n&gt;&gt; I still have the same basic settings.\n\n406\n00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.940\nBut there is a little bit that changed,\nright?\n\n407\n00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.720\nNow that I'm linked to an iCloud account,\nthere's a new option down here.\n\n408\n00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.690\nAllow user to reset\npassword using Apple ID.\n\n409\n00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.390\nIt knows that I'm linked to an Apple ID,\nan iCloud account, or iTunes account or\n\n410\n00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.590\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n411\n00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:00.850\nApple ID is the official name.\n\n412\n00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.580\nSo I'm linked up right there.\n\n413\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.750\nAnd that's how I can tell that I'm linked.\n\n414\n00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:08.120\nBut otherwise, this all looks the same.\n\n415\n00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.870\nSo the user account doesn't really change,\nright?\n\n416\n00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.480\nThings are pretty much\njust the way they are and\n\n417\n00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.060\nyou have your iCloud account separate,\nyour local user separate.\n\n418\n00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.450\nBut now they're linked in terms of being\nable to reset and sync those services.\n\n419\n00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.330\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n420\n00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.140\nAre there any other accounts\nwe should be aware of?\n\n421\n00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.015\nYeah, there's a few.\n\n422\n00:19:27.015 --> 00:19:29.640\nWhat we've talked about are the normal\naccounts that you work with.\n\n423\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.481\nThere are a few accounts, though,\nthat we don't normally work with.\n\n424\n00:19:33.481 --> 00:19:36.123\nAnd in fact, some that are even\nhidden that we don't even see.\n\n425\n00:19:36.123 --> 00:19:39.235\nBut there's one sitting right in\nfront of us I wanna point out and\n\n426\n00:19:39.235 --> 00:19:41.440\nthat's the Guest User account.\n\n427\n00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.020\nNow when I came to this panel, I came to\nit to show you how my account changed.\n\n428\n00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.880\nBut the guest account changed.\n\n429\n00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.170\nWhen I connected to iCloud, or\n\n430\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:54.270\nbefore I connected to iCloud,\nthe guest user account was disabled.\n\n431\n00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.000\nNobody could log in as a guest.\n\n432\n00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.560\nBut now, it says Guest User Enabled,\nManaged.\n\n433\n00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.330\nWhat happened there?\n\n434\n00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.590\nSo what is the guest user account?\n\n435\n00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.517\nWell, if I wanna loan my computer to\nsomebody and let them use it, but\n\n436\n00:20:08.517 --> 00:20:10.160\nit's just a one time thing.\n\n437\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.940\nI don't want them to create a user\naccount, and save a bunch of files.\n\n438\n00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.780\nI can let them use a guest account.\n\n439\n00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.520\nThey can log in as a guest, and\nthey'll be able to use the computer, but\n\n440\n00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.380\nthey won't have access to my data.\n\n441\n00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.860\nTheir data will be wiped\nout when they log out, so\n\n442\n00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.390\nit doesn't save anything behind,\nand somebody can share my computer.\n\n443\n00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:27.842\nWell, most of us don't like to share.\n\n444\n00:20:27.842 --> 00:20:29.148\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n445\n00:20:29.148 --> 00:20:31.070\nwe leave the guest account turned off.\n\n446\n00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:36.760\nIt's off by default, but when I connected\nto iCloud, it turned on the guest account.\n\n447\n00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.390\nDoesn't that make it less secure?\n\n448\n00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.040\nWell, this is actually tied to\nthe Find My Mac feature, right?\n\n449\n00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.650\nThe way Find my Mac works is if\nsomebody steals my laptop and\n\n450\n00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:52.260\nthey take it somewhere and they fire\nit up and connect it to the Internet.\n\n451\n00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.260\nWhen they connect it to the Internet,\nmy Mac will phone home.\n\n452\n00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.600\nIt'll phone home to me\nto tell me where it is.\n\n453\n00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.379\nAnd so I can try and\nlocate it based on that.\n\n454\n00:20:59.379 --> 00:21:01.930\nOr if I just put it somewhere and\nforgot it, right?\n\n455\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:06.021\nBut if somebody steals my Mac and\nit's locked with a password and\n\n456\n00:21:06.021 --> 00:21:07.990\nthey can't log in.\n\n457\n00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.959\nWhat are they gonna do?\n\n458\n00:21:08.959 --> 00:21:11.479\nThey're just gonna format it and\nreinstall macOS and\n\n459\n00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.780\nnow it's never gonna phone home, right?\n\n460\n00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.590\nSo it needs a way to phone home.\n\n461\n00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.550\nAnd the way they do that is\nthey enable the guest account.\n\n462\n00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.310\nSo if somebody steals my laptop,\nthey can't log in as me, but\n\n463\n00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.030\nthey can click Guest.\n\n464\n00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:26.760\nAnd if they do, they can connect it to\na wireless network, like a Starbucks or\n\n465\n00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.700\ntheir home network or whatever,\nand now it can phone home.\n\n466\n00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.970\nThat's why it turns on that guest account.\n\n467\n00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:35.240\nOn an iPad or\nan iPhone they have a GPS, right, and\n\n468\n00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.100\nthey can phone home over the cellular\nnetwork and that's that.\n\n469\n00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.550\nBut I don't have a cellular\nnetwork in my laptop, or\n\n470\n00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.370\nin my Mac mini, so\nthose don't work, right?\n\n471\n00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:46.170\nSo it has to have some way and\nthat's why it turns on that guest account.\n\n472\n00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.670\nI didn't make the guest account.\n\n473\n00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.140\nIt's there by default.\n\n474\n00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.290\nAnd as far as changes, as far as we're\nconcerned, there's just enabling or\n\n475\n00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:54.270\ndisabling it.\n\n476\n00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:58.790\nIf I disable the guest account right now,\n\n477\n00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.880\nFind My Mac will still work,\nbut it will only work\n\n478\n00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.740\nif it's connected to one of the networks\nthat I've already got set up on it.\n\n479\n00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.770\nSo if I've just lost it and\nI can't remember if I left it at work or\n\n480\n00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.160\nat home, well, Find My Mac will find that.\n\n481\n00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.630\nBut if it gets stolen,\nFind My Mac is not going to work,\n\n482\n00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.540\nit's not going to find it and\nthat's pretty much that.\n\n483\n00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.860\nSo that's why the guest\naccount got turned on.\n\n484\n00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.465\nThere's actually one more account that we\ndon't even see in the list, all right?\n\n485\n00:22:23.465 --> 00:22:26.432\nmacOS, it is a super easy\nto use operating system,\n\n486\n00:22:26.432 --> 00:22:31.475\nit's got a nice graphical user interface,\nvery intuitive and easy for people to use.\n\n487\n00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:37.689\nBut under the hood, it's running a very\npowerful operating system called BSD.\n\n488\n00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:40.298\nBSD is a variant of\nthe Unix operating system.\n\n489\n00:22:40.298 --> 00:22:46.820\nUnix is incredibly stable and powerful,\nand incredibly not user friendly.\n\n490\n00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.682\nIt's a difficult operating system to use,\nand so\n\n491\n00:22:49.682 --> 00:22:53.470\nmost users would just not\nbe capable of operating it.\n\n492\n00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:54.910\nBut it's there, it's under the hood.\n\n493\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.410\nApple has done an amazing job of\nhiding all of that from the end user.\n\n494\n00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:06.140\nWell, in the Unix world, your system has\nto have a default administrative account,\n\n495\n00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.340\nand the name of that account is root,\nR-O-O-T, the root user.\n\n496\n00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:16.360\nWell, because this is based on Unix,\nthere is a root user account.\n\n497\n00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.290\nWe just don't see it,\nokay, but it is there.\n\n498\n00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.810\nWhen you go to perform an action that\nyou have to be an administrator to do,\n\n499\n00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.420\nand it prompts you for\n\n500\n00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:28.715\nyour password, what you're actually\ndoing is saying don't run this as me.\n\n501\n00:23:28.715 --> 00:23:30.245\nRun it as root.\n\n502\n00:23:30.245 --> 00:23:31.923\nYou're running it as a different user,\nright?\n\n503\n00:23:31.923 --> 00:23:33.735\nLet me just show you an example so\nwe can see that.\n\n504\n00:23:33.735 --> 00:23:37.088\nI'm going to bring up the terminal.\n\n505\n00:23:37.088 --> 00:23:41.917\nAnd the terminal, whoops, which if you\ndon't spell it right, will not launch.\n\n506\n00:23:41.917 --> 00:23:43.420\nSo I'm gonna bring up the terminal.\n\n507\n00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:48.283\nAnd in traditional fashion here,\nit's way too small, here we go.\n\n508\n00:23:48.283 --> 00:23:49.904\nAnd in the terminal,\n\n509\n00:23:49.904 --> 00:23:54.777\nif you ever wonder how do you really\nknow this is BSD or whatever?\n\n510\n00:23:54.777 --> 00:23:58.159\nIf you run the Uname command,\nthat's the Unix name command, so\n\n511\n00:23:58.159 --> 00:24:01.051\nshow me the name of the operating\nsystem I'm running.\n\n512\n00:24:01.051 --> 00:24:05.727\nAnd when I run that, it tells me\nnot that I'm running macOS 10.13 It\n\n513\n00:24:05.727 --> 00:24:10.098\ntells me that I'm running\nthe Darwin kernel version 17.4, and\n\n514\n00:24:10.098 --> 00:24:15.250\nthat's Apple's code name for their\nversion of BSD Unix, they call it Darwin.\n\n515\n00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n516\n00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.290\nbecause it was an evolution\npast the old Mac OS.\n\n517\n00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.995\nSo any how that's the operating\nsystem that I'm running.\n\n518\n00:24:23.995 --> 00:24:26.742\nAnd if I type who am I,\nI can see that I'm dpezet,\n\n519\n00:24:26.742 --> 00:24:29.870\nthat's the account that I'm logged in as.\n\n520\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:35.950\nBut if I use the sudo command,\nthat's the super user do command, right.\n\n521\n00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:40.290\nSo I want to run something as\na super user, and I run who am I.\n\n522\n00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.720\nWhen I run that,\nit prompts me for my password.\n\n523\n00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.460\nI'm doing something that needs to be an\nadministration, I'll punch in my password.\n\n524\n00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.076\nAnd then it runs, and who am I?\n\n525\n00:24:48.076 --> 00:24:49.168\nI'm root.\n\n526\n00:24:49.168 --> 00:24:50.524\nR-O-O-T.\n\n527\n00:24:50.524 --> 00:24:51.340\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n528\n00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.350\n&gt;&gt; I'm running as that\nroot administrative user.\n\n529\n00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.450\nSo, that account exists.\n\n530\n00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:57.790\nIt's there.\n\n531\n00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:59.660\nIt's walled off though, right?\n\n532\n00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.130\nI can't log in as that root user account.\n\n533\n00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.590\nI can't say, hey I'm root.\n\n534\n00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.540\nI can only act like root on occasion.\n\n535\n00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.020\nAnd that's what\nadministrative accounts do.\n\n536\n00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.580\nSo I wanted you guys to be aware\nthat the root user does exist.\n\n537\n00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.700\nIt is there, it's just tucked away in the\nbackground and we don't normally see it.\n\n538\n00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.620\n&gt;&gt; Don, how does Mac OS keep each\nuser's data separate from the others?\n\n539\n00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.300\n&gt;&gt; That's a really important\nthing to understand,\n\n540\n00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.920\nis that each of these user\naccounts are separate, right?\n\n541\n00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.446\nSo it's my account and now I've made one\nfor you and for Mike and for Ronnie.\n\n542\n00:25:27.446 --> 00:25:29.231\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Every one of those accounts has\n\n543\n00:25:29.231 --> 00:25:30.192\ntheir own data.\n\n544\n00:25:30.192 --> 00:25:33.560\nWell that Mike account doesn't, right,\nbecause we did a sharing only account.\n\n545\n00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.160\nSo that's easy to keep separate there.\n\n546\n00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.160\nHe has nothing.\n\n547\n00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.055\nBut the rest of us do have files and\nresources right here on the drive.\n\n548\n00:25:40.055 --> 00:25:42.193\nAnd I wanna spend some\ntime talking about that,\n\n549\n00:25:42.193 --> 00:25:45.081\nbecause where that data is stored and\nhow it's kind of organized\n\n550\n00:25:45.081 --> 00:25:48.040\nis important to understand if\nyou're gonna be supporting Macs.\n\n551\n00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.450\nSo I know we're short on time though-\n&gt;&gt; Yep, we're doing it again.\n\n552\n00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.712\n&gt;&gt; Let's do this Zach, let's break\nup into a part two on this one.\n\n553\n00:25:54.712 --> 00:25:56.898\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And in part two when we get back,\n\n554\n00:25:56.898 --> 00:26:00.598\nI wanna show everybody how the user\ndata is isolated on the disk and\n\n555\n00:26:00.598 --> 00:26:02.590\nhow it's kept separate.\n\n556\n00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:07.660\nAnd how that interaction occurs between\nthe user data and how it gets protected.\n\n557\n00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.094\nThere's also a few other things that I\nwanna talk about like what happens when we\n\n558\n00:26:11.094 --> 00:26:14.442\nremove a user and how we back up that\nuser's data or restore the user's data.\n\n559\n00:26:14.442 --> 00:26:16.332\nAnd so it all kind of builds up for\n\n560\n00:26:16.332 --> 00:26:19.620\nthat one question of how\nthis data kept separate.\n\n561\n00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:24.170\nSo let's take a look at that on part two,\nbut as far as how to create user accounts,\n\n562\n00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:27.780\nthe different types of user accounts,\nand linking up to iCloud.\n\n563\n00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.610\nI think we've seen, just in part one here,\n\n564\n00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:34.030\nthe majority of what people are gonna\ndo when they manage user accounts.\n\n565\n00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.060\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\nWell, managing user accounts part two\n\n566\n00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:36.590\ncoming your way.\n\n567\n00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.860\nThis has been part one.\n\n568\n00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.410\nSee them both,\n\n569\n00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:42.360\nsee everything inside the Apple\nCertified Support Professional Series.\n\n570\n00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.660\nBefore we go though,\nI know you wanna say one more thing.\n\n571\n00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.790\n&gt;&gt; I typically do,\n&gt;&gt; You do [LAUGH]\n\n572\n00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.410\n&gt;&gt; We've seen adding user accounts.\n\n573\n00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:53.540\nOne thing we haven't talked about\nwas in an enterprise environment.\n\n574\n00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.510\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; If you have thousands of users,\n\n575\n00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.320\nyou're not gonna add them all\nright in here, that's crazy.\n\n576\n00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.387\nYou'd have to have super\nlevels of patience.\n\n577\n00:27:00.387 --> 00:27:03.570\nSo instead you are gonna use some\nkind of centralized directory.\n\n578\n00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.040\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And there's a number of directories\n\n579\n00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.770\nout there.\n\n580\n00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:08.459\nApple supports OpenLDAP,\nthey have the Apple Open Directory,\n\n581\n00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:10.012\nwhich is their version of OpenLDAP.\n\n582\n00:27:10.012 --> 00:27:12.570\nThey also support\nMicrosoft's Active Directory.\n\n583\n00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.080\nAnd these are centralized databases\nwhere the user accounts exist.\n\n584\n00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.870\nAnd your Mac just connects and\nshares that database.\n\n585\n00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:19.960\nSo in a corporate environment,\n\n586\n00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.180\nthere's actually a different type\nof connection for those accounts.\n\n587\n00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:27.020\nAnd those user accounts won't show\nup in the Users and Groups panel,\n\n588\n00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:31.090\nlike we've been seeing, until after\nyou've connected to the directory.\n\n589\n00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:37.142\nIf you're interested in seeing that,\nwe do have the Mac Server Essentials,\n\n590\n00:27:37.142 --> 00:27:40.599\nwhich Apple's kinda killed off that show.\n\n591\n00:27:40.599 --> 00:27:42.947\nBut we filmed that back under\nsome previous versions,\n\n592\n00:27:42.947 --> 00:27:44.587\nlike under Mavericks and El Capitan.\n\n593\n00:27:44.587 --> 00:27:47.526\nSo if you check it out in the ITProTV\nlibrary, you can see how to set up one of\n\n594\n00:27:47.526 --> 00:27:50.100\nthose directories and\nactually share those accounts.\n\n595\n00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.390\nWe also talk about in the Mac\nintegration basics content\n\n596\n00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.570\nwhich is part of the Apple\ncertified associate.\n\n597\n00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:59.040\nAnd that is being updated for\nthe High Sierra version, so\n\n598\n00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.450\nyou can see it there as well.\n\n599\n00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.440\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Don, no stone unturned.\n\n600\n00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.490\nApple-certified support professionals,\nsee everything in this series.\n\n601\n00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.190\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n602\n00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:07.440\nAnd you're in the course library too,\n\n603\n00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.500\nand there's thousands of other\nvideos there to help you go further.\n\n604\n00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.900\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n605\n00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.790\nA good IT pro is always learning.\n\n606\n00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:16.410\nThanks for watching.\n\n607\n00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:17.240\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n608\n00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:17.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.300\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n7\n00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.320\nchoosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.101\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n9\n00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:20.495\nFor this episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional,\n\n10\n00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:23.170\nthis is managing user accounts part two.\n\n11\n00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.260\nAnd the person bringing us the information\nwe need is the one only Don Pezet.\n\n12\n00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.395\nDon, great to see you again, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:28.536\n&gt;&gt; Hey, great to be back.\n\n14\n00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:32.125\nAnd if you watched part one, then you saw\nwhere we talked about user accounts, and\n\n15\n00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:33.510\nhow MacOS handles those.\n\n16\n00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.070\nWe talked about how to\ncreate the accounts, and\n\n17\n00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.410\nhow they're actually five\ndifferent kinds of accounts.\n\n18\n00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.767\nWe looked at each of them\nas we worked up a few.\n\n19\n00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:42.910\nAnd got a chance to see\nwhat those features were.\n\n20\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.380\nBut we had a lot more to get through\nthat we just didn't have time.\n\n21\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.370\nSo we're gonna be picking back up\non that right here in part two,\n\n22\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.520\nas we talk a little bit more about\nhow those user accounts exist,\n\n23\n00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.060\nhow we work with them, and how we can get\nrid of them if we don't need them anymore.\n\n24\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.909\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nIn fact,\n\n25\n00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.870\nthe teaser was how does macOS keep\nthe users' data separate from each other.\n\n26\n00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.610\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\nwhen I created a couple of accounts,\n\n27\n00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.720\nI have three or\nfour accounts on the system now.\n\n28\n00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.290\nEach user has a separate\nset of preferences.\n\n29\n00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.660\nAnd I had mentioned that in an earlier\nepisode that when you go into system\n\n30\n00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.950\npreferences, the very top bar in system\npreferences are the personal preferences.\n\n31\n00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.630\nThey apply just to you,\nnot to the other user accounts.\n\n32\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.020\nSo every user has their\nown set of preferences.\n\n33\n00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.020\nThey also have their own set of documents,\npictures,\n\n34\n00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.110\nmusic, the other things that\nare part of their profile.\n\n35\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.220\nNow, the way that's represented to a user\n\n36\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.460\nkind of masks the complexity that\nis going on behind the scenes.\n\n37\n00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.382\nThere is a lot more that\nhappens on the backend.\n\n38\n00:01:38.382 --> 00:01:42.028\nWhere macOS is isolating the user data and\nkeeping it separate from other\n\n39\n00:01:42.028 --> 00:01:45.927\npeople to stop one person from\noverwriting another person's data, right?\n\n40\n00:01:45.927 --> 00:01:47.360\nLet me show you what it\nlooks like to the user.\n\n41\n00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.715\nSo if we just take our desktop here,\nI'm still logged in as me.\n\n42\n00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:54.200\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And if I go into the Finder,\n\n43\n00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.700\nwhen I launch the Finder, the Finder is\ndesigned to be kinda easy to use, right?\n\n44\n00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.416\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I see Applications, Desktop, Documents,\n\n45\n00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:03.770\nright?\n\n46\n00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.610\nWhat it's actually showing me here\nis a little bit different and\n\n47\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.410\nthis is trying to make things easy,\nthere's a little more to it.\n\n48\n00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.650\nWhen I look at the Documents folder,\nthat's my Documents folder.\n\n49\n00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.870\nIf I were log in as Ronnie or\n\n50\n00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.840\nlog in as Zach, I would see their\ndocuments folder, not mine.\n\n51\n00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.200\nIt's separate, right?\n\n52\n00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.390\nSame thing with Downloads.\n\n53\n00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.170\nI'm seeing my downloads, stuff that\nI've downloaded from the Internet\n\n54\n00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.750\non my desktop,\nstuff that I've put on the desktop.\n\n55\n00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.380\nWhere it is really confusing though\nis when you get to things like\n\n56\n00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.160\nthe applications folder.\n\n57\n00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.870\nBecause there is an overall applications\nfolder that holds applications for\n\n58\n00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.020\nevery person, right.\n\n59\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.480\nBut there's also an application's\nfolder inside of each user account.\n\n60\n00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.100\nSo for example, I can install\nan application just for me and\n\n61\n00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.780\nthen when Zach logs in,\nhe wouldn't see it, right?\n\n62\n00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.950\nAnd that's all managed to\nwhat's called a User Profile.\n\n63\n00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.530\nUser Profile's a collection of folders\nthat has the data that pertains just\n\n64\n00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.530\nto that user.\n\n65\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.290\nAnd in the finder,\nwe don't see that by default.\n\n66\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.490\nYou can change the finders preferences\nto make it show your personal data.\n\n67\n00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.630\nBut if you want to see your profile,\n\n68\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.430\nthe easiest way is if you\ngo up top to the Go menu.\n\n69\n00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.750\nSo up on our top menu bar, you've got Go,\nand inside of Go, you'll see\n\n70\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.340\na number of options to browse into here,\nmany of which are in the finder, right?\n\n71\n00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.610\nLike the Downloads folder or\n\n72\n00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.240\nDesktop folder, Ddcuments, those are in\nthe finder, it's the same thing, right?\n\n73\n00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.000\nBut there's also Home, right.\n\n74\n00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.450\nWhat is home?\n\n75\n00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.680\nHome is gonna take me to my folder.\n\n76\n00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.050\nThe folder that pertains to my\nuser account and my information.\n\n77\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.200\nIf Zach logs i, and he clicks on Home,\nit will go to his folder.\n\n78\n00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.320\n&gt;&gt; Because there's no place like home.\n\n79\n00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.600\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you click your heels\ntogether, you click on that link and\n\n80\n00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.320\nthen all of the sudden you get your data.\n\n81\n00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.440\nAnd if I click on that, I'm gonna see my\nhome folder, the finder navigates to it,\n\n82\n00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.580\nand see how up top it's showing a little\nhouse and it says, dpezet, right.\n\n83\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.300\nThis is my user account's home folder.\n\n84\n00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.820\nNow, it's saying dpezet, but\nmy user account is Don Pezet, right?\n\n85\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.640\nWhen I look up here, I see Don Pezet.\n\n86\n00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.150\nSo it's odd that it would\nbe a different name.\n\n87\n00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.940\nAnd if I go into System Preferences,\nI can jump in here and\n\n88\n00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.060\ntake a look at my user account as it's\ndefined in the System Preference.\n\n89\n00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.103\nAnd when I look at it here,\nit shows up as Don Pezet.\n\n90\n00:04:27.103 --> 00:04:28.130\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n91\n00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.407\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mentioned how in\nthe background macOS is running Unix,\n\n92\n00:04:33.407 --> 00:04:35.470\nit's running BSD Unix.\n\n93\n00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.380\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n94\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.550\nIn the BSD world,\nyou can't have spaces in your username, so\n\n95\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.843\nyou have a Unix compatible username, and\nthen you have your friendly user name.\n\n96\n00:04:46.843 --> 00:04:47.469\n&gt;&gt; Aha.\n\n97\n00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:50.320\n&gt;&gt; What we're seeing here is\nthe friendly name, right?\n\n98\n00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.520\nWhen we create a user account, it\nactually asks us to provide both, right?\n\n99\n00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.190\nSo if I come in here and create a new user\naccount, it's asking for a full name,\n\n100\n00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.640\nand then you got this account name.\n\n101\n00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.290\nRight, the account name is\nthat Unix compatible name.\n\n102\n00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.961\nSo if I create one for Bob Denver,\nright, it suggests a new name.\n\n103\n00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:11.395\nAnd see how it just took the spaces out?\n\n104\n00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:12.140\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n105\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.382\n&gt;&gt; And it's all lowercase because-\n&gt;&gt; So you like Gilligan's Island?\n\n106\n00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:16.274\n&gt;&gt; Well, everybody likes it.\n\n107\n00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:18.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's our little buddy.\n\n108\n00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.310\nAnd so I can punch that in there,\nI can change it, and\n\n109\n00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.720\nthen just gives me that little note.\n\n110\n00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.470\nThis will be used as the name for\nyour home folder.\n\n111\n00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.329\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; But if I didn't pay attention to that,\n\n112\n00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:29.580\nright, and most people don't.\n\n113\n00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.341\nAnd I go and I create the user, then it\nmight throw me for a bit of a loop when I\n\n114\n00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:35.030\ngo to my home directory and\nI see that it's named something different.\n\n115\n00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.080\nBut that's all a part of how Unix\nis working in the background.\n\n116\n00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.370\nAnd here's where I can see My Desktop,\nMy Documents, My Downloads, My Movies,\n\n117\n00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.460\nthis is stuff from my account.\n\n118\n00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.432\nThere's actually even more in my\nprofile that's not showing up here\n\n119\n00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:50.287\nit's kinda hidden, let me show you that.\n\n120\n00:05:50.287 --> 00:05:54.021\nWe're gonna go into that Unix\nworld in the background.\n\n121\n00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:54.584\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n122\n00:05:54.584 --> 00:05:58.252\n&gt;&gt; And you don't normally need to do all\nthis but I wanna show it to you guys so\n\n123\n00:05:58.252 --> 00:06:00.670\nyou'll understand what is back there.\n\n124\n00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.790\nWhoops, and if I hit the right keys here,\nI can zoom in on this more.\n\n125\n00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:04.580\n&gt;&gt; I like the noises, they're nice.\n\n126\n00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.094\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When I open up a terminal,\n\n127\n00:06:07.094 --> 00:06:10.080\nit's actually taking me\nright to my user folder.\n\n128\n00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.900\nAnd I know that because it says right,\ndpezet, right,\n\n129\n00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.330\nthat's the folder that I'm in.\n\n130\n00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.790\nIn UNIX, if you type pwd,\n\n131\n00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:21.620\nyou get the present working directory,\nI'm in a folder called Users.\n\n132\n00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.660\nAnd inside of that Users' folder,\nthere is one folder for each account.\n\n133\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.570\nIf I pull up a listing of that folder,\nI see a dpezet folder,\n\n134\n00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.050\na Ronnie Wong, a Zachary folder.\n\n135\n00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.780\nI don't see a Mike Rodrick folder because\nwe made him a sharing-only account.\n\n136\n00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.490\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n137\n00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.840\n&gt;&gt; He doesn't have a profile.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n138\n00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.460\n&gt;&gt; But every user has their own profile,\nright.\n\n139\n00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.660\nAnd if I go into my profile,\nwhich I'm already in, and\n\n140\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.540\nI pull up a listing, I see those\nsame folders that were displayed\n\n141\n00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.990\nover here in the finder a moment ago,\nokay?\n\n142\n00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.070\nSo I'm seeing that same information.\n\n143\n00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.190\nBut here, I can actually view a little\nbit more and see some hidden things.\n\n144\n00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.900\nSome folders and\nfiles that are hidden away.\n\n145\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.370\nAnd when I look, I'll start to see\nthings like this Library folder, right?\n\n146\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:14.010\nThe Library folder contains preferences\nand other settings from my account.\n\n147\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.520\nAnd normally, a user wouldn't need to\nget into this, but if you go into it,\n\n148\n00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.800\nyou'll find there's actually a lot\nof stuff tucked away in there.\n\n149\n00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.140\nMost applications will store their\npreferences and settings and\n\n150\n00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.360\noptions in here.\n\n151\n00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.700\nYou've actually got a preferences folder,\n\n152\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.070\nwhich is where the macOS\npreferences will be stored.\n\n153\n00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.800\nSo if I change my wallpaper to be,\nI don't know.\n\n154\n00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.520\n&gt;&gt; A bear.\n\n155\n00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, a bear and Zach want's\nto change My Little Pony, right?\n\n156\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:41.710\n&gt;&gt; I love that.\n\n157\n00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.230\n&gt;&gt; He can do that.\n\n158\n00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.749\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n159\n00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:45.060\n&gt;&gt; His will be stored in his own\npreferences, mine will be in mine.\n\n160\n00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.977\nAnd now we got it, I guess the bear's\na little more in line with the High Sierra\n\n161\n00:07:48.977 --> 00:07:51.102\ntheme than My Little Pony but either way.\n\n162\n00:07:51.102 --> 00:07:52.083\n&gt;&gt; There's little ponies in the Sierra.\n\n163\n00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:55.215\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Maybe wild horses.\n\n164\n00:07:55.215 --> 00:08:00.333\nSo that's really what's going on here,\nall of this information is being\n\n165\n00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:06.030\ntracked per User and that's how Apple\nis kind of separating this stuff out.\n\n166\n00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.071\nNow, I can actually browse\ninto somebody else's folder.\n\n167\n00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:12.840\nI can browse into Zach's folder.\n\n168\n00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.151\nAnd when I look in there,\nI can see things.\n\n169\n00:08:15.151 --> 00:08:17.800\nI can get access to your data, right?\n\n170\n00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.075\nNot really.\nThe only reason I can get into here is\n\n171\n00:08:20.075 --> 00:08:22.790\nbecause Zach has a public folder.\n\n172\n00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.242\nThat public folder is\nwhere he can put data so\n\n173\n00:08:25.242 --> 00:08:29.040\nthat other users have access to it,\nif he wants to share something.\n\n174\n00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.520\nBut if I wanna give in to his documents,\nall right?\n\n175\n00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.604\nAnd start poking around in his documents,\nI got permission denied, right?\n\n176\n00:08:37.604 --> 00:08:40.180\nI don't have access to Zach's documents.\n\n177\n00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.218\nI don't have access to pictures or\nmusic, just the public.\n\n178\n00:08:44.218 --> 00:08:46.390\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If I run it as a super user,\n\n182\n00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:51.470\nI can override.\n\n183\n00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.927\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n&gt;&gt; And actually do all sorts of\n\n184\n00:08:52.927 --> 00:08:54.040\ncrazy things.\n\n185\n00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.410\nSo like if I try and\nlist /Users/zachary/Documents\n\n186\n00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.154\nlike that, I get permission denied.\n\n187\n00:09:03.154 --> 00:09:08.460\nBut if I pseudo that, I'm gonna run it\nas root, well, after I authenticate.\n\n188\n00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.250\nAnd it works, I look in there and\nI can see it, right?\n\n189\n00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.920\n&gt;&gt; You can see my dark secrets now.\n\n190\n00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.858\n&gt;&gt; But a normal user is not going\nto be able to do that, right?\n\n191\n00:09:15.858 --> 00:09:16.667\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n192\n00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:19.432\n&gt;&gt; Another thing that's worth pointing out\nis, I use the terminal here to show it,\n\n193\n00:09:19.432 --> 00:09:21.430\ncuz the terminal is kinda handy for\nthis stuff.\n\n194\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.471\nBut you actually can get to some\nof this through the finder.\n\n195\n00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:30.004\nIf I go back to my finder, what I'm\nlooking at here is my profile, but\n\n196\n00:09:30.004 --> 00:09:32.680\na library folder is missing.\n\n197\n00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.790\nLet's say I wanna get\ninto that Library folder.\n\n198\n00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.764\nWell it's hidden.\n\n199\n00:09:34.764 --> 00:09:37.270\nIt's hidden, I can't see it, right?\n\n200\n00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.667\nIf I go up to my Go menu I also don't see,\nI see a lot on my profile stuff,\n\n201\n00:09:41.667 --> 00:09:43.320\nwrong menu, there we go.\n\n202\n00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.270\nA lot of my profile stuff, but\nI don't see that Go menu, right?\n\n203\n00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:52.864\nBut on your keyboard, if you hold\nthe Option key or the Alt-Option key,\n\n204\n00:09:52.864 --> 00:09:57.215\nif you hold that Option key\nLibrary magically appears.\n\n205\n00:09:57.215 --> 00:09:58.850\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; There it is, right?\n\n206\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.710\nIt appears and I can choose that and\nwhen I do, now, I can navigate to it and\n\n207\n00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.093\nI'm in that library folder and\nI can browse through it, right?\n\n208\n00:10:06.093 --> 00:10:09.510\nAnd if I wanted to see another\nuser's folder, like Zach's.\n\n209\n00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:14.851\nI could browse to my hard drive,\nin here we can navigate and\n\n210\n00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:18.231\nfind our disk and browse in that way.\n\n211\n00:10:18.231 --> 00:10:20.705\nOr you can just go up top here,\nand use that Go menu and\n\n212\n00:10:20.705 --> 00:10:24.670\nwith the Go menu I'm normally choosing\none of these items that's already listed.\n\n213\n00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:30.430\nBut you can actually choose Go To Folder\nand pull out a specific folder to go to.\n\n214\n00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.481\nAnd I can say you know what?\nI wanna go to /Users/Zach, whoops,\n\n215\n00:10:34.481 --> 00:10:42.320\nslashes there, and into his Public folder,\ncuz I have access for that, right?\n\n216\n00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.328\nSo when I type that,\nI can browse to it and there I am,\n\n217\n00:10:44.328 --> 00:10:45.580\nnow I'm in his folder, right?\n\n218\n00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.597\nSo we can browse around and access some\nof these things, but the permissions\n\n219\n00:10:49.597 --> 00:10:54.010\nare locking down that access to make sure\nthat I can't get at another user's data.\n\n220\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.426\nAnd that's important to understand\nthat our user data is kept separate,\n\n221\n00:10:57.426 --> 00:10:58.871\nkept isolated and protected.\n\n222\n00:10:58.871 --> 00:11:03.180\nSo that we don't have to worry about\none user messing with another.\n\n223\n00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.963\n&gt;&gt; Well, how do we get rid of accounts\nthat we no longer need, though?\n\n224\n00:11:05.963 --> 00:11:11.290\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's say that I've got Ronnie's account,\n\n225\n00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:16.420\nand he is on here still if I\nnavigate up a folder or two here.\n\n226\n00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:21.290\nLet me pull that up, whoops,\nget out of the user folder, there we go.\n\n227\n00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.120\nSo Ronnie has a folder, and\nit's called Ronnie Wong, right?\n\n228\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.024\nAnd that's where his user profile and\nhis data is stored.\n\n229\n00:11:27.024 --> 00:11:32.191\nAnd if go into my users system preference,\nI'll see that Ronnie Account\n\n230\n00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:36.400\nsitting there, let me get in,\nwhoops, it's so small.\n\n231\n00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.879\nLet me zoom in,\nI can't barely see it myself.\n\n232\n00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:38.538\n&gt;&gt; Good zoom.\n\n233\n00:11:38.538 --> 00:11:42.089\n&gt;&gt; And [LAUGH] as I get older I find\nI need to zoom in a little more, and\n\n234\n00:11:42.089 --> 00:11:43.508\na little more each year.\n\n235\n00:11:43.508 --> 00:11:44.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n236\n00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:48.275\n&gt;&gt; But if I get into my user preferences\nhere and I find Ronnie's account,\n\n237\n00:11:48.275 --> 00:11:51.278\nlet's say that Ronnie\ndoesn't work with us anymore.\n\n238\n00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:56.420\nAnd so we don't need his account anymore,\nwell, could I just leave it?\n\n239\n00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.469\nI could, but\nlet's say he made a big scene and\n\n240\n00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:02.207\nwe had to get security to escort him out.\n\n241\n00:12:02.207 --> 00:12:05.266\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm laughing because\neverybody loves Ronnie.\n\n242\n00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:07.367\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know Ronnie, he's a troublemaker.\n\n243\n00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:11.665\nSo I really want to make sure\nthat he can't come back in and\n\n244\n00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:13.380\nlog in again, right?\n\n245\n00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.320\nHe just needs to be deactivated.\n\n246\n00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.150\nWell, I’ve got a couple of choices\non how I wanna do that, right?\n\n247\n00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.468\nOne of the easiest things we could\ndo is just change his password.\n\n248\n00:12:22.468 --> 00:12:25.950\nIf I change his password he\nwon’t be able to login anymore.\n\n249\n00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:26.821\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; But I know it,\n\n250\n00:12:26.821 --> 00:12:28.810\nI know his password, right?\n\n251\n00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:29.878\nSo I can come in and\n\n252\n00:12:29.878 --> 00:12:33.950\nI can unlock this because you have\nto be an administrator to do this.\n\n253\n00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:38.288\nAnd I can take Ronnie’s account, and,\nI left parental controls on him,\n\n254\n00:12:38.288 --> 00:12:39.490\nI'll turn that off.\n\n255\n00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.672\nSo I can come in, and\nthen I can just reset his password, and\n\n256\n00:12:42.672 --> 00:12:44.800\nreset it to something that I know.\n\n257\n00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.298\nAnd now that I know it, he can't login,\nI can login as him, and\n\n258\n00:12:48.298 --> 00:12:50.410\nI can get at his information, right?\n\n259\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:55.017\nBut what if he is consuming\na lot of disk space, right?\n\n260\n00:12:55.017 --> 00:12:59.297\nMaybe the reason he got let go is\nthat he downloaded terabytes of\n\n261\n00:12:59.297 --> 00:13:01.858\nvideo files on the company network.\n\n262\n00:13:01.858 --> 00:13:03.709\n&gt;&gt; Boy.\n&gt;&gt; And so, we need to free up that disk\n\n263\n00:13:03.709 --> 00:13:05.340\nspace and get rid of that.\n\n264\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.170\nWell, we can get rid of his account.\n\n265\n00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.048\nThe way you get rid of an account\nis you just highlight it, and\n\n266\n00:13:10.048 --> 00:13:12.650\nyou hit the minus button\ndown here beneath it.\n\n267\n00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:18.760\nAnd when you do that, it's gonna offer\nthree ways to remove the user, right?\n\n268\n00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.790\nAnd which one you choose is gonna vary\nbased on what your particular need is,\n\n269\n00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:24.350\nright?\n\n270\n00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:30.380\nSo looking at this, the first option is\nsave the home folder in a disk image.\n\n271\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.932\nWhat it's gonna do is it's gonna\ndelete Ronnie's account but\n\n272\n00:13:33.932 --> 00:13:38.153\nit'll take all of his files, all the stuff\nthat was in the home folder, and\n\n273\n00:13:38.153 --> 00:13:41.810\nit's gonna package it up into\none nice neat little DMG file.\n\n274\n00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.582\nThe DMG file is a disk image and\nall of it's kind of tucked together.\n\n275\n00:13:44.582 --> 00:13:48.918\nAnd it's nice because I can back that up,\nand then down the road maybe six months\n\n276\n00:13:48.918 --> 00:13:52.370\nfrom now, somebody says hey,\nwhere's that report?\n\n277\n00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.930\nThey say Ronnie was working on that,\nI don't have a copy of it.\n\n278\n00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:59.328\nI wonder, maybe it was in his Home Folder,\nlet me go to this image, open it up,\n\n279\n00:13:59.328 --> 00:14:01.410\nsee if I can find the report, right?\n\n280\n00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.360\nIt's nice to have that back up.\n\n281\n00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.466\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; If we care about the user's data,\n\n282\n00:14:06.466 --> 00:14:07.460\nright?\n\n283\n00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.908\nIf we don't care about the users data,\nwe can actually do this bottom option,\n\n284\n00:14:09.908 --> 00:14:10.700\ndelete the home folder.\n\n285\n00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.959\nJust delete it, we're gonna get rid of\nRonnie, we're gonna get rid of his data,\n\n286\n00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:18.260\nit's all gone, that's that,\nand we don't need it, right?\n\n287\n00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.570\nAnd if that's really what we wanted\nwe can certainly do that, right?\n\n288\n00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.820\nThe third option though is\ndon't change the home folder.\n\n289\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.699\nIn other words,\nI'm gonna delete the user account but\n\n290\n00:14:28.699 --> 00:14:31.400\nI'm gonna leave the home\nfolder right where it is.\n\n291\n00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.950\nOkay, now why would I wanna do that?\n\n292\n00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.785\nWell, if I put it into a disk image,\nthen in order to get at the files,\n\n293\n00:14:38.785 --> 00:14:40.780\nI've gotta open up the disk image.\n\n294\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.594\nAnd Spotlight,\nthe search functionality inside of Mac OS,\n\n295\n00:14:44.594 --> 00:14:47.860\ndoesn't search inside of the DMG file.\n\n296\n00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.024\nSo I won't be able to search for\nfiles in there until I mount it.\n\n297\n00:14:50.024 --> 00:14:53.595\nBut if I think I'm gonna be searching\nthrough these files a lot or\n\n298\n00:14:53.595 --> 00:14:56.980\nmaybe I want to attach them to\nanother user account later on.\n\n299\n00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.131\nI might choose to just leave them right on\nthe hard drive where they are right now\n\n300\n00:15:00.131 --> 00:15:01.340\nand so I've got that option.\n\n301\n00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.154\nNow, I'll delete two accounts\nwe'll start with Ronnie,\n\n302\n00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:06.092\nI'm gonna delete the home folder.\n\n303\n00:15:06.092 --> 00:15:08.113\nI'm gonna wipe out his account and\nhis home folder.\n\n304\n00:15:08.113 --> 00:15:10.166\nI'll just delete it out right, okay?\n\n305\n00:15:10.166 --> 00:15:13.005\nAnd then I'm gonna take,\nlet's see Mike was sharing only, so\n\n306\n00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:17.400\ndeleting him's not really gonna make any\ndifference at all, so just wipe him out.\n\n307\n00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.690\nAnd then Zach,\nI'm gonna delete Zach's account.\n\n308\n00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.080\n&gt;&gt; Stands to reason.\n\n309\n00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.982\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm gonna tell it to save his home\n\n310\n00:15:24.982 --> 00:15:26.210\nfolder.\n\n311\n00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:27.357\nAnd I'm gonna save it in a disk image.\n\n312\n00:15:27.357 --> 00:15:28.990\n&gt;&gt; In a disk image, right.\n\n313\n00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.850\n&gt;&gt; And so it's gonna take all of\nhis information and package it up.\n\n314\n00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.202\nSee how, well,\nit happened really fast there, but\n\n315\n00:15:34.202 --> 00:15:36.640\nRonnie's account was\ngone almost instantly.\n\n316\n00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.270\nBut with Zach's it said deleting\naccount and it took a moment, right?\n\n317\n00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.930\nCuz it was packaging\neverything up into a DMG.\n\n318\n00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.663\nThe more data he has,\nthe longer it's going to take to do that.\n\n319\n00:15:46.663 --> 00:15:50.168\nNow, when it's done, what happened?\n\n320\n00:15:50.168 --> 00:15:52.841\nWell, let me go back into the terminal\nhere, and I'll show you, right?\n\n321\n00:15:52.841 --> 00:15:55.717\nSo I'm currently in that\nslash /Users folder.\n\n322\n00:15:55.717 --> 00:15:56.308\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n323\n00:15:56.308 --> 00:15:59.911\n&gt;&gt; And if I take a look There is\nno Zachary folder any more and\n\n324\n00:15:59.911 --> 00:16:01.992\nthere is no Ronnie Wong folder.\n\n325\n00:16:01.992 --> 00:16:03.731\nAnd there never was\na Mike Roderick folder, right?\n\n326\n00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:05.827\nSo those folders are gone, right?\n\n327\n00:16:05.827 --> 00:16:09.882\nAnd what's left is me and\nthe guest account, right?\n\n328\n00:16:09.882 --> 00:16:11.192\nThere's a shared folder, right?\n\n329\n00:16:11.192 --> 00:16:12.439\nI didn't talk about the shared folder.\n\n330\n00:16:12.439 --> 00:16:14.080\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; The shared folder is\n\n331\n00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.450\nlike the name implies,\nshared across all the users.\n\n332\n00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.421\nSo if I have a document or a picture or a\nvideo that I want everybody to have access\n\n333\n00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:23.726\nto, I can put it in the shared folder and\neverybody will see it, so\n\n334\n00:16:23.726 --> 00:16:25.191\nthat's what that one does.\n\n335\n00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:29.410\nBut the deleted users folder,\nthat wasn't there a minute ago.\n\n336\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.940\nThat's new, right?\n\n337\n00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.870\nSo when I deleted Zach's account and\n\n338\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.130\nI said I want to store it in a disk image,\nwhere did it put that image?\n\n339\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:37.900\nRight there.\n&gt;&gt; Right there.\n\n340\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.339\n&gt;&gt; I go in and take a look at that folder,\nzachary.dmg, right?\n\n341\n00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:47.372\nAnd if I wanna open that up and take\na look at it, I can certainly do that.\n\n342\n00:16:47.372 --> 00:16:53.136\nThe easiest way is if we go\nback to our Go menu up top and\n\n343\n00:16:53.136 --> 00:17:00.087\nchoose Go to folder,\nI can browse to /users/deletedusers.\n\n344\n00:17:03.347 --> 00:17:06.422\nAnd when I browse that folder,\nthere is the DMG,\n\n345\n00:17:06.422 --> 00:17:10.460\nI can just double-click on it and\nit's gonna mount it.\n\n346\n00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.490\nAnd once it's mounted, it opens it up and\nhere's Zach's profile, right?\n\n347\n00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.581\nAnd nothing's hidden in here, right?\n\n348\n00:17:17.581 --> 00:17:20.879\nI can see that Library folder that would\nnormally be hidden, there it is, but\n\n349\n00:17:20.879 --> 00:17:24.250\nI've got access to his Downloads,\nhis Documents, his Desktop.\n\n350\n00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.677\nEarlier when I tried to go to his\nDocuments, I got permission denied, right?\n\n351\n00:17:27.677 --> 00:17:28.713\nI wasn't allowed.\n\n352\n00:17:28.713 --> 00:17:32.220\nNow, I can navigate right in, right?\n\n353\n00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.819\nBecause when it put it into a DMG\nit strips off the file permissions.\n\n354\n00:17:35.819 --> 00:17:36.336\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n355\n00:17:36.336 --> 00:17:38.537\nnow, all that data is right there.\n\n356\n00:17:38.537 --> 00:17:41.820\nNow, that means we need to be careful\nbecause the data's unprotected.\n\n357\n00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.390\nIf somebody stole this DMG file,\n\n358\n00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.690\nthey'd have access to all\nof Zach's old data, right?\n\n359\n00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.080\nSo we wanna make sure we\nkeep this somewhere safe.\n\n360\n00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.560\nBut we have access to that data as\nwell which can be pretty handy.\n\n361\n00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.760\nSo when it comes to getting\nrid of a user account,\n\n362\n00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.160\nit's up to us which of\nthose three methods we use.\n\n363\n00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.350\nEach one kinda fits a different scenario.\n\n364\n00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.020\nBut they're pretty effective and\n\n365\n00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.210\nit allows us to control what\nhappens to that user data.\n\n366\n00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.700\n&gt;&gt; So after we've done all of this,\n\n367\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.230\nis there a way to bring a user\nback if we need it again?\n\n368\n00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.480\nBring a user back from the dead.\n\n369\n00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.068\n&gt;&gt; Bring them back.\n\n370\n00:18:09.068 --> 00:18:13.308\n&gt;&gt; And so\nthe official answer here is no, right?\n\n371\n00:18:13.308 --> 00:18:16.820\nOnce you delete a user account,\nthe user is gone, right?\n\n372\n00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.270\nAnd there's no undelete that I can just\nhit a button and bring that user back.\n\n373\n00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.839\nUnofficially, there's actually a couple\nof different ways we can do it.\n\n374\n00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:25.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n375\n00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.191\n&gt;&gt; Some are more useful than others,\nright?\n\n376\n00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:33.175\nSo the only way that Apple truly\nsupports undeleting the user,\n\n377\n00:18:33.175 --> 00:18:39.850\nisn't just undeleting the user, we could\ndo a restore of a time machine back up.\n\n378\n00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:40.681\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n379\n00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:41.345\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say that.\n\n380\n00:18:41.345 --> 00:18:42.679\nTime machine makes sense, yeah.\n\n381\n00:18:42.679 --> 00:18:44.331\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the problem there, though,\n\n382\n00:18:44.331 --> 00:18:47.920\nis the time machine backup has not just\nthis user, the whole computer, right?\n\n383\n00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n384\n00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.910\nI'm gonna have to roll\nthe whole computer back.\n\n385\n00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.604\nWell, what if this was six months later?\n\n386\n00:18:53.604 --> 00:18:56.484\nI don't wanna roll back six months and\nlose all my work.\n\n387\n00:18:56.484 --> 00:18:57.658\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of time machine.\n\n388\n00:18:57.658 --> 00:18:59.025\n&gt;&gt; It would be.\n\n389\n00:18:59.025 --> 00:19:02.308\nI'd be better off just searching the time\nmachine back up to find the files that I\n\n390\n00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:03.934\nwanted cuz that works as well, right?\n\n391\n00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:04.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n392\n00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.271\n&gt;&gt; So while that one works,\n\n393\n00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:10.883\nit's not terribly effective because\nof how we get at the data, right?\n\n394\n00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:11.990\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n395\n00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.500\nafter that we've run out of\nthe officially supported stuff, and\n\n396\n00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.630\nwe're gonna have to go unofficial, right?\n\n397\n00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:21.109\nUnofficially, if I deleted Zach's account,\nI could just make a new one.\n\n398\n00:19:21.109 --> 00:19:24.360\nI could make a new account called Zachary,\nright?\n\n399\n00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.980\nAnd when I do that,\nas long as his Home folder was deleted,\n\n400\n00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.480\nit'll just recreate the Home\nfolder with the same name.\n\n401\n00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.420\nAnd he's now got a user account.\n\n402\n00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.932\nHe's missing his data, but if I backed it\nup as a DMG, I can just restore it and\n\n403\n00:19:36.932 --> 00:19:38.124\ncopy it right back.\n\n404\n00:19:38.124 --> 00:19:39.850\nAnd now, I'm in business, okay?\n\n405\n00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:41.740\nSo that's one way to go about it.\n\n406\n00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:47.330\nIf I left the Home folder there before,\nI could just rename the Home folder,\n\n407\n00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.900\ncreate his new account, and then copy all\nthe data over from the Home folder that I\n\n408\n00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.370\nleft before or move the data over,\nto give them the access.\n\n409\n00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.810\nBut it is important to\nunderstand that the new account\n\n410\n00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:59.170\nis different than the old account.\n\n411\n00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:03.790\nThe new account might be named Zachary and\nthe old account might be named Zachary,\n\n412\n00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:08.360\nbut every user account has what's\ncalled a UID, or a user ID.\n\n413\n00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.840\nAnd that user ID is\na number assigned to them.\n\n414\n00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.660\nAnd in the Unix world they don't reuse\nthe number or not automatically.\n\n415\n00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.472\nSo the original Zach account\nmight have been user 501.\n\n416\n00:20:20.472 --> 00:20:23.013\nThe new Zach might be 502.\n\n417\n00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:24.185\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And so on BSD,\n\n418\n00:20:24.185 --> 00:20:28.209\nwhen it's looking at permissions,\nit sees that number not the name.\n\n419\n00:20:28.209 --> 00:20:31.989\nI could have five accounts all named\nZachary and it would be fine with that,\n\n420\n00:20:31.989 --> 00:20:35.603\nbecause they each had a different number,\na UID that identified them.\n\n421\n00:20:35.603 --> 00:20:37.440\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So that's why we can't just easily\n\n422\n00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.340\nrecreate an account because it's\ngoing to have that different number\n\n423\n00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.020\nwhich gives us a bit of headache.\n\n424\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.640\nSo those are things to think\nabout when we delete a user and\n\n425\n00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.230\nit's another reason why you don't\nwant to be too hasty and say,\n\n426\n00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:54.420\nall right, we let this person go,\nor hey, this person had\n\n427\n00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.420\na great opportunity at another company,\nso they put in their two weeks notice.\n\n428\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.490\nThey left and now,\nthey're working for somebody else.\n\n429\n00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.490\nInstead of deleting their account,\nI'm just gonna disable it for\n\n430\n00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.830\nright now, right?\n\n431\n00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:09.101\nBecause who knows, maybe two weeks\nlater they come back and they say, boy,\n\n432\n00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:13.172\nI thought that was going to be a great\nopportunity at the other company but\n\n433\n00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:14.330\nit's not the same.\n\n434\n00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.380\nIs there any chance I can come back?\n\n435\n00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.560\nAnd if you've disabled their account,\nyou just go and re-enable it.\n\n436\n00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.100\nAnd everything's back to\nthe way that it was, right?\n\n437\n00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.175\nIf they're consuming a ton of disk space,\nthat doesn't help you, but\n\n438\n00:21:27.175 --> 00:21:28.902\nit does make it a little\neasier to recover.\n\n439\n00:21:28.902 --> 00:21:33.970\nSo I normally do recommend that people\njust disable instead of deleting.\n\n440\n00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.326\nNow, in Mac OS, at least in the GUI,\n\n441\n00:21:36.326 --> 00:21:40.744\nthere is no actual disable option\nthat I can check, in Unix there is.\n\n442\n00:21:40.744 --> 00:21:45.160\nBut if we reset their password, then it\ndoesn't matter if the account is active or\n\n443\n00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.540\nnot, because they can't log in,\nit's the same effect as disabling it.\n\n444\n00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.811\nAnd then in an enterprise environment\nyou'll have a centralized directory and\n\n445\n00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:55.517\nyou can disable in a centralized\ndirectory, you can do it there.\n\n446\n00:21:55.517 --> 00:21:57.608\nBut easy enough to just\nchange their password and\n\n447\n00:21:57.608 --> 00:21:59.191\nnow, you've got it sitting there.\n\n448\n00:21:59.191 --> 00:22:02.228\nAnd then eventually as time goes by you\nsay, all right, it's been long enough,\n\n449\n00:22:02.228 --> 00:22:05.260\nlet's go ahead and\njust delete this account and that's that.\n\n450\n00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.650\nGreat job as usual, Don.\n\n451\n00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.040\nManaging user accounts part two.\n\n452\n00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.840\nMake sure you see part one.\n\n453\n00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.395\nAnd before we move on, Don, last words?\n\n454\n00:22:12.395 --> 00:22:14.760\n&gt;&gt; The only other thing I\nguess that I need to mention.\n\n455\n00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.250\nI never did talk about automatic logons.\n\n456\n00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:23.130\nThat when somebody logs into the system,\nif you have more than one user account or\n\n457\n00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:27.180\neven if it's just you, you power on\nthe system and you see your kinda face and\n\n458\n00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.300\nyour password, there is actually an option\nwhere you can turn on automatic logons.\n\n459\n00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.380\nWhen you push the power button it\njust automatically goes right into\n\n460\n00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.790\nthe operating system.\n\n461\n00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:39.113\nA lot of people don't even know about\nuser accounts, thanks to that feature.\n\n462\n00:22:39.113 --> 00:22:39.776\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n463\n00:22:39.776 --> 00:22:42.630\nall the stuff I talked about\nlike isolating user data,\n\n464\n00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:46.590\nthat doesn't happen if everybody\nis logged in as the same account.\n\n465\n00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.510\nSo if you have multiple people\nusing the same computer,\n\n466\n00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.980\nyou will want to create\nmore than one user account.\n\n467\n00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.090\nAnd there's a couple of little\nquirks that go along with that, and\n\n468\n00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.990\nwe're gonna tackle that\nin an upcoming episode.\n\n469\n00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:00.740\nLook for an episode titled multiple\nuser accounts, cuz we'll address how to\n\n470\n00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.180\nhandle that when you have more than\none person sharing it with you.\n\n471\n00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.710\n&gt;&gt; Awesome job as usual, Don.\n\n472\n00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.130\nApple Certified Support Professional,\nthis is a wonderful series and\n\n473\n00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.420\nDon's doing a terrific job\nputting this together for you.\n\n474\n00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.147\nSo make sure you see every episode.\n\n475\n00:23:12.147 --> 00:23:13.643\nAnd you're in the course library, so\n\n476\n00:23:13.643 --> 00:23:16.517\nthere's thousands of other videos\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n477\n00:23:16.517 --> 00:23:17.850\nCheck those out, too.\n\n478\n00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.032\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n479\n00:23:20.032 --> 00:23:21.910\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n480\n00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.420\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n481\n00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.100\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n482\n00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.433\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n483\n00:23:25.433 --> 00:23:32.268\n[MUSIC]\n\n484\n00:23:32.268 --> 00:23:37.110\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:17.450\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\n\n9\n00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.390\nthis episode of Apple Certified\nSupport Professional Multiple account\n\n10\n00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.470\nusers is the title of this episode and\n\n11\n00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.250\nDon Pezet once again said,\nI'm gonna show you what we mean by that.\n\n12\n00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.040\nThank you so much for\nbeing here Don, thanks a lot.\n\n13\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.650\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here you\nknow in our last episodes,\n\n14\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.500\nwe've been talking about user accounts.\n\n15\n00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.390\nAnd I wanted to spend a little bit\nof time specifically talking about,\n\n16\n00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.660\nwhen we have more than one user account.\n\n17\n00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.900\nWhen you buy a new Mac it walks\nyou through the little wizard and\n\n18\n00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.090\nit creates one account.\n\n19\n00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.220\nAnd for a lot of us we just stick\nwith that one selfish people.\n\n20\n00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.290\nAnd we just had our laptop just for us.\n\n21\n00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.250\nAll you need is one account.\n\n22\n00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.490\nAnd that's most of us have.\n\n23\n00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.170\nBut things get a little bit different when\nwe start to add in additional accounts.\n\n24\n00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.760\nSo, we're gonna take a look at\nwhat those differences are,\n\n25\n00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.770\nright here in this episode.\n\n26\n00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.000\n&gt;&gt; So why would we want\nmultiple user account, Don?.\n\n27\n00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.660\n&gt;&gt; So there's a couple of\ndifferent reasons, right?\n\n28\n00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.290\nMaybe we have more than one identity,\nour secret identity.\n\n29\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.980\nClark Kent, that kind of thing.\n\n30\n00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.180\nBut more commonly, it's because we're\nsharing our computer with somebody, right?\n\n31\n00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.230\nThat maybe it's a family,\nso you've got a parents and\n\n32\n00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.390\nchildren and they all share one computer.\n\n33\n00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.130\nSo we might want separate accounts for\neverybody.\n\n34\n00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.360\nThat would facilitate separating out data.\n\n35\n00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.430\nAnd having separate data means,\nwe have separate preferences as well.\n\n36\n00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.430\nSo the dad in the family might\nhave a Magnum P.I. background,\n\n37\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.800\nand the daughter in the family might have\na Care Bear background, and everybody has\n\n38\n00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.400\ntheir own backgrounds, and that's fine,\nit's all separate and it's isolated and\n\n39\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.730\nthat's just for personal preferences,\nbut it could be security as well, right.\n\n40\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.584\nIt might be that I have a sales person\nwho has financial data that's being\n\n41\n00:01:54.584 --> 00:01:58.802\nstored on the computer, and\nthen I have a person in the shipping\n\n42\n00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:03.198\ndepartment who just logs in on\nthe computer to check their email.\n\n43\n00:02:03.198 --> 00:02:07.647\nI need to make sure that shipping person\ndoesn't have access to the financial data\n\n44\n00:02:07.647 --> 00:02:08.740\nof the user.\n\n45\n00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.640\nSo we use separate accounts.\n\n46\n00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.910\nIf you just share one account everybody\nhas access to each other's information.\n\n47\n00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.280\nOne user could delete another user's data.\n\n48\n00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.500\nUsers can read each other information,\nthere's no privacy created by that.\n\n49\n00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.330\nMultiple user accounts would facilitate\nthat, so those are a few scenarios, but\n\n50\n00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.760\nbasically what it boils down to is,\n\n51\n00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.890\nif you share the computer\nwith more than one person.\n\n52\n00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.770\n&gt;&gt; What changes in Mac OS when\nwe have multiple accounts?\n\n53\n00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.960\n&gt;&gt; There's a few things that can change,\nright?\n\n54\n00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.560\nDepending on how your Mac is set up,\n\n55\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.700\nif you've only got one account right now,\nyou might have automatic log on turned on.\n\n56\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.350\nWhere when you press power on your Mac,\nit boots up and\n\n57\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.840\nit goes straight in as your account\nright to the desktop, okay?\n\n58\n00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.470\nBut when we have multiple user accounts,\nyou don't want that.\n\n59\n00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.060\nYou don't want it to automatically log in.\n\n60\n00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.190\nAnd so when we start creating more,\nthat's something that needs to change.\n\n61\n00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.040\nWe need to see the login\nscreen when we come through.\n\n62\n00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.920\nNow if you do a clean\ninstall of Mac OS today,\n\n63\n00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.120\nthe automatic sign on is not turned on.\n\n64\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.360\nBut if you've been upgrading\nfrom previous versions,\n\n65\n00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.120\nyou might still have it turned on\nfrom before, and you can do that.\n\n66\n00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.460\nLet me show you that option quick.\n\n67\n00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.740\nIf I go into my User Preferences here,\n\n68\n00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.030\nI'm gonna go into System Preferences and\ninto Users &amp; Groups.\n\n69\n00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.420\nWhen I get in here, I can find my\nuser account and basic information.\n\n70\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.150\nI want to look at the log in options.\n\n71\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.560\nI need to unlock this panel first though,\nso let me unlock.\n\n72\n00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.280\nAnd when I go into Login Options here,\nthese aren't login options just for me,\n\n73\n00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.380\nthese are login options for the computer.\n\n74\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.470\nThat's why I had to unlock it,\nif it was just for me,\n\n75\n00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.640\nI could do that right from my account.\n\n76\n00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.880\nWhen I go under Don Pezet here,\nwhere I've got my Login Items.\n\n77\n00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.630\nI don't have to unlock to\nget to this stuff, and\n\n78\n00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.550\njust gonna remove that\none while I'm in here.\n\n79\n00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.000\n[LAUGH] And so\nI can change those settings easy enough.\n\n80\n00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.143\nThe log in options are for\n\n81\n00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:56.149\nthe computers as a whole, and\nhere's automatic log in, right?\n\n82\n00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:58.078\nAutomatic log in is off on mine,\n\n83\n00:03:58.078 --> 00:04:02.230\nwe did this as a clean install\nin episode number 2, I think so.\n\n84\n00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.960\nIn Mac OS High Sierra,\nautomatic log in is turned off by default.\n\n85\n00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.140\nBut you can turn it on, and if you do you\ncan tell who you want to log in as, right?\n\n86\n00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.650\nBut if you got more than one\nuser you don't want that.\n\n87\n00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.710\nInstead, you want a log in\nscreen to be displayed, right?\n\n88\n00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.390\nAnd normally it's going to display\na list of those user accounts and\n\n89\n00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.880\nyou'll see their icons.\n\n90\n00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.780\nSo if I come in here and I add a new user,\nso I'll give Zach an account back again.\n\n91\n00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.470\n&gt;&gt; Good, thank you.\n\n92\n00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.105\n&gt;&gt; After I deleted you\nin the last episode.\n\n93\n00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:32.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so I'll create an account for\n\n94\n00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.080\nhim and get that added in.\n\n95\n00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.240\nSo now, I'm gonna go from\nsingle user to multi-user.\n\n96\n00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.790\nAll right, now on this Mac because\nI had turned on multiple users in\n\n97\n00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.110\nanother episode, there's something\nthat's not going to happen for\n\n98\n00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.120\nme that would normally happen for\neverybody else.\n\n99\n00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.450\nWhen you add that second user,\noops [INAUDIBLE] admin.\n\n100\n00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.860\nYou got to pay attention\nto permissions there.\n\n101\n00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.640\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n102\n00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.080\n&gt;&gt; So when you add that second user,\n\n103\n00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.060\nyou might notice on your screen something\ninteresting which is up here at the top,\n\n104\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.290\nyour name appears, it did happen for\nme I just wasn't paying attention.\n\n105\n00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.850\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n&gt;&gt; Your name appears, right?\n\n106\n00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.340\nThat's a good identifier when you are on\na computer like does that have more\n\n107\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.270\nthan one account.\n\n108\n00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.680\nDo I see that, that user account there?\n\n109\n00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.740\nSo I do.\n\n110\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.630\nAnd so I now I've got that second account.\n\n111\n00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.350\nBut the big difference is going\nto be the login screen, right?\n\n112\n00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.800\nSo now, that I've got an account here for\nZach, I can log out.\n\n113\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.940\nSo let me just go up here and\nI will choose to log out.\n\n114\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.800\nAnd when I log out, my screen is gonna\ngo blank as it logs out of my profile.\n\n115\n00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.250\nAnd then, it's gonna bring me\nback to the log in screen, right?\n\n116\n00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.430\nAnd normally,\nit would happen pretty quick.\n\n117\n00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.220\nIt was fast enough.\n\n118\n00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.020\n&gt;&gt; It was fast.\n\n119\n00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.920\n&gt;&gt; And now instead of just seeing one,\nI see multiple icons.\n\n120\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.390\nThe more users I create,\nthe more of these icons I'm going to see.\n\n121\n00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.420\nAnd I can pick that user to log in.\n\n122\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.480\nI say that's one of the biggest difference\nis right here on the log in screen,\n\n123\n00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.930\nyou know, seeing that option\nto pick more than one user.\n\n124\n00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.440\nAfter that though, the next\ndifference has to do with that menu.\n\n125\n00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.091\nThat menu up top where my\nname shows up here, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:05.580\nWhat that actually is is a special menu.\n\n127\n00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.130\nIt's called the fast user switching menu.\n\n128\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.315\nAnd if you were watching Eagle Eyed, you\nmight have noticed when I was in the Users\n\n129\n00:06:12.315 --> 00:06:15.540\n&amp; Groups panel that there was an option\nthat mentioned fast user switch.\n\n130\n00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.240\nLet me bring that back up.\n\n131\n00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.690\nThe moment you create\na second user account.\n\n132\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.190\nIt's going to turn on fast user switching.\n\n133\n00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.790\nNow, normally in a regular world\nif I had four user accounts here,\n\n134\n00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.110\nonly one user could be\nlogged in at the same time.\n\n135\n00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.680\nSo if I logged in and\nI was half way through some work,\n\n136\n00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.591\nand I lock the screen, and\nI walk away from the computer.\n\n137\n00:06:40.591 --> 00:06:44.540\nWell, Zach might walk up and\nhe wants to use it.\n\n138\n00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.280\nBut I locked the screen.\n\n139\n00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.740\nSo he can't get into it.\n\n140\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.080\nSo even though he has a valid account,\n\n141\n00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.910\nhe can't log in because\nI'm all ready in there.\n\n142\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.960\nNow, there is one way to get around that.\n\n143\n00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.880\nZach could unplug the Mac and\npower it off.\n\n144\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.950\nAnd then plug it back in, and when it\npowers back up he'll see the log in and\n\n145\n00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.350\nhe can log in and use it, right?\n\n146\n00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.920\nBut he had to kick me out.\n\n147\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.390\nI lost any work that I was working on,\nright?\n\n148\n00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.700\nOnly one user can be logged in at a time.\n\n149\n00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.960\nWell, fast user switching allows more than\none person to be logged in at a time,\n\n150\n00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.000\nall right?\n\n151\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.300\nLet me show you that.\n\n152\n00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.590\nSo if I go in here to my Login Options,\nthe option that I'm talking about is this\n\n153\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.470\nright here,\nShow fast user switching menu as.\n\n154\n00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.850\nThe fast user switching menu doesn't\nshow up when you only have one account,\n\n155\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.110\ncuz there's nobody to switch to.\n\n156\n00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.420\nBut the moment you create a second one,\nMac OS turns this on and\n\n157\n00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.830\nit shows the full names.\n\n158\n00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.530\nAnd you can change it to\nshow the account name, or\n\n159\n00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.610\njust the icon if you\nwanna make it smaller.\n\n160\n00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.910\nBut I kinda like full name,\nbecause it's what we normally see.\n\n161\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.970\nAnd so now, I've got fast user switching.\n\n162\n00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.030\nBut the reality is fast user switching,\nit's always on.\n\n163\n00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.494\nEven when you have one user account,\nit's on.\n\n164\n00:07:50.494 --> 00:07:54.597\nIt's just kinda hidden away from us,\nbut now thanks to this menu,\n\n165\n00:07:54.597 --> 00:07:59.137\nI can actually see it, and it looks\nlike just my name, but if I click on it,\n\n166\n00:07:59.137 --> 00:08:00.550\nit is actually a menu.\n\n167\n00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.683\nAnd I'll see each of the users\non my system, right?\n\n168\n00:08:04.683 --> 00:08:09.300\nSo I can see me, and I can see Zach,\nand I can see other options, right?\n\n169\n00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.380\nNow, let's say I'm done using the\ncomputer, I'm about to walk away, right?\n\n170\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:19.340\nInstead of locking the screen, if I lock\nthe screen, only I can unlock it, right?\n\n171\n00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:25.350\nBut instead of locking it, if I choose\nlogin window, when I do that, what I'm\n\n172\n00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:31.010\ndoing here will stay running and then\nsomeone else can log-in at the same time.\n\n173\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.388\nSo for example,\nlet's say that I fire up Safari and\n\n174\n00:08:35.388 --> 00:08:39.147\nI go to a website like ours,\nI go to ITPro.TV, all right.\n\n175\n00:08:39.147 --> 00:08:45.751\nWhoops, I guess that you have to spell it\nright in order for the browser to work.\n\n176\n00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:47.530\nHow do you spell TV?\n\n177\n00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.383\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n178\n00:08:48.383 --> 00:08:50.277\n&gt;&gt; Okay, apparently I went to a Twitter\n\n179\n00:08:50.277 --> 00:08:52.000\npage, but that will work.\n\n180\n00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.860\n&gt;&gt; Hey!\n&gt;&gt; So you know I'm on Twitter and\n\n181\n00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.030\nI'm browsing and\nthen having a great time, right?\n\n182\n00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:00.220\nAnd maybe I fire up a note window here and\n\n183\n00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.650\nI start to type some notes.\n\n184\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.160\nWell, notes saves automatically,\nthat's maybe not the fairest example,\n\n185\n00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.505\nbut whatever, it'll work.\n\n186\n00:09:10.505 --> 00:09:14.680\nSo I come in here and\nI just jot down some notes.\n\n187\n00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.450\nSo, I'm doing work and\nthen I'm gonna walk away.\n\n188\n00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:23.060\nSo, I go up here to my menu a nd I\nchoose to return to the login window.\n\n189\n00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.210\nAnd when I do that,\nmy screen is gonna blank out,\n\n190\n00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.980\nand I left it zoomed in when I did it,\nso there we go.\n\n191\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.500\nDid you see that weird little\npanning effect that it did?\n\n192\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n193\n00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.640\nThat's to let me visually know,\nhey, it didn't close myself.\n\n194\n00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.310\nIt just put me on the back burner.\n\n195\n00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.480\n&gt;&gt; Pushed to the aside.\n\n196\n00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.420\n&gt;&gt; And so now in the login screen, see\nhow my name has this little check mark in\n\n197\n00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:49.650\na golden circle, or yellow, or whatever\ncolor that is, I'm not good with colors.\n\n198\n00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.285\n&gt;&gt; Ochre!\n\n199\n00:09:50.285 --> 00:09:51.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's ochre?\n\n200\n00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:51.960\n&gt;&gt; Ochre.\n\n201\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nwhatever it is, I can see it.\n\n202\n00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.140\nThat's to let me know, hey, I'm actually\nlogged in already and I might be running\n\n203\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.130\nprograms and doing stuff, but\nit's okay for someone else to log in.\n\n204\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.654\nZach can pick his account and\nhe can log in, right?\n\n205\n00:10:05.654 --> 00:10:10.210\nAnd so now he's able to get into\nthe system and use it, right?\n\n206\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.400\nHe can browse the web.\n\n207\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.240\nHe can start to access files and\nfolders and whatever.\n\n208\n00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.600\nShoot.\nThis is the first time\n\n209\n00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.250\nI'm logging in as Zach, so\nit takes a second to create his profile.\n\n210\n00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.620\n&gt;&gt; I should have done that ahead of time,\n\n211\n00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.730\nbut I'll skip the iCloud stuff to\nmake this a little bit faster.\n\n212\n00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:28.720\nAnd any moment now.\n\n213\n00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.120\nSo when a new user logs in,\nthey get a new profile, right?\n\n214\n00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it's gotta build that.\n\n215\n00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.950\nThat's what it's doing right here.\n\n216\n00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.110\nThere we go.\nSo now Zach's logged in, okay?\n\n217\n00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.150\nNow, Zach can get in here and\nstart doing whatever it is he wants to do.\n\n218\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.580\nSo he wants to find the news, right?\n\n219\n00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.520\nSo he fires up Safari and goes to,\nwhat's your favorite news site?\n\n220\n00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.068\n&gt;&gt; My favorite news site\nwould be the Yahoo news.\n\n221\n00:10:48.068 --> 00:10:50.460\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo news.\n\n222\n00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n223\n00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.270\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we'll go find Yahoo.\n\n224\n00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.310\nAnd so he's over here browsing,\ntaking a look at what's going on.\n\n225\n00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.727\nSuper blue blood moon,\nthat just sounds exciting.\n\n226\n00:10:59.727 --> 00:11:00.787\nAll right, so-\n&gt;&gt; See, that's why.\n\n227\n00:11:00.787 --> 00:11:01.995\nIt's because of that moon.\n\n228\n00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So here we go.\n\n229\n00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.220\nSo he's browsing the web, right.\n\n230\n00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.880\nAnd meanwhile my stuffs still\nrunning in the background.\n\n231\n00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.302\nHe might not even know it, right?\n\n232\n00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:12.070\nThere's just nothing here on the screen\nthat would indicate that I've got things\n\n233\n00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.240\nrunning in the background.\n\n234\n00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.570\nAlthough, if I let some crazy process\nrunning, maybe it slows down a little bit,\n\n235\n00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.940\nbut otherwise it's just turning along,\nright?\n\n236\n00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.590\nNow, when Zack's done, he could return\nit to log in or maybe I'll come back and\n\n237\n00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.760\nI'm like Zack, actually,\nI was working on something.\n\n238\n00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.975\nWould you mind if I just switch over\nto me and save my documents real quick?\n\n239\n00:11:27.975 --> 00:11:29.550\nAnd Zach says, sure.\n\n240\n00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.540\nWell, he doesn’t have to\nclose his stuff and log out.\n\n241\n00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:36.410\nHe can just go up to the menu and\neither pick me or go to the login window.\n\n242\n00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:37.810\nThe login window is an extra step here.\n\n243\n00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:42.680\nHe can just pick me and now it’s going\nto flip back over to my session.\n\n244\n00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.640\nNow, notice it just immediately\ntook me to my login.\n\n245\n00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.440\nSo I can just punch in my password.\n\n246\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.100\nAnd when I do that, it's gonna take\nZach and put him on the back burner and\n\n247\n00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.910\nthen you just saw the screen flip back\nagain, now it's my data up there.\n\n248\n00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.160\nAnd here's the note that I was jotting.\n\n249\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.010\nIn fact, the cursor is still\nblinking in the same spot.\n\n250\n00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:06.720\nThere's Twitter doing its thing in the\nbackground and I'm able to work, right?\n\n251\n00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.020\nWe're both logged in at the same time and\nwe're both running programs, but\n\n252\n00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.960\nMacOS is isolating us.\n\n253\n00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.830\nAnd it's isolating us not just on the hard\ndrive, where our profiles are separate,\n\n254\n00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:18.000\nit's isolating us in memory too.\n\n255\n00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.710\nZach's programs are running under\na separate permissions from my programs.\n\n256\n00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:25.435\nSo if I close Safari,\nit doesn't close his.\n\n257\n00:12:25.435 --> 00:12:29.190\nThere's actually two different\ncopies of Safari running.\n\n258\n00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.280\nAnd if you take a look at your activity\nmonitor, which is a tool we haven't really\n\n259\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.930\nused in this show, but the activity\nmonitor is part of the built-in utilities.\n\n260\n00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.500\nIt will show you all the programs\nthat are running on the system and\n\n261\n00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.370\nwho the user is that's running them,\nright.\n\n262\n00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:49.010\nSo what I'm seeing right now are all\nthe processes tied to my account, but\n\n263\n00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:54.290\nyou can change it to tell it you\nwant to see everybody's processes.\n\n264\n00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.545\nIt's buried in here somewhere.\n\n265\n00:12:56.545 --> 00:13:00.410\nHere, I want to see other user processes.\n\n266\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.830\nAnd when we do that, well,\nit's going to change and\n\n267\n00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:08.010\nnow I can see processes that\nare run by Zach, right.\n\n268\n00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.090\nThese other programs that\nare in the background and\n\n269\n00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.470\nif I sort them by name I should be\nable to find his Safari instance\n\n270\n00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.220\nburied in here somewhere and\nsee that he is running Safari right there.\n\n271\n00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.460\nThere it is,\nSafari being run by Zach, right?\n\n272\n00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:26.840\nSo it's still running and\nI don't mean like it's paused, right?\n\n273\n00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.130\nIf it was doing something,\nit's still doing it.\n\n274\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.620\nIf he was playing a video,\nit's still playing the video, right?\n\n275\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.350\nIt doesn't pause the applications.\n\n276\n00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.960\nThey run, they do stuff.\n\n277\n00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.950\nOr some of the applications\ndo just sit there.\n\n278\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.600\nIf he was in a word processor,\nthen it's gonna sit there and do nothing.\n\n279\n00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.170\nBut if it's a video, it'll just continue\nto play and we can return back to it.\n\n280\n00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:51.130\nAnd notice how the CPU count\nthe threads are changing because\n\n281\n00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.540\nthe web browser is caching the resources.\n\n282\n00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.770\nSo there's probably like\nrotating ads on that webpage and\n\n283\n00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.070\nso those are still updating.\n\n284\n00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.230\nBut it's a pretty neat feature to have\nbecause you can let more than one person\n\n285\n00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:04.140\nuse the computer, you can switch\nbetween them pretty easily, and\n\n286\n00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.490\neach user doesn't have to\nworry about losing their data.\n\n287\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.690\n&gt;&gt; Well, Doug, do we give up\nanything when using fast switching?\n\n288\n00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.380\n&gt;&gt; You don't give up a ton,\nthere are a few things, right?\n\n289\n00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.170\nSo performance, right?\n\n290\n00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.490\nMaybe Zach is running some crazy\nvideo game in the background and\n\n291\n00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.120\nit's eating up a ton of memory and\ngenerating a lot of disk IO.\n\n292\n00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.980\nIt might slow down my experience.\n\n293\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.890\nIf Zach were to log out and I logged in,\n\n294\n00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.380\nI would then have exclusive\naccess to all the hardware.\n\n295\n00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.340\nI'd get better performance, right?\n\n296\n00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.560\nBut that's a pretty uncommon scenario.\n\n297\n00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.740\nBut that could happen.\n\n298\n00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.200\nAnother thing we have to worry\nabout is security, right?\n\n299\n00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.030\nSecurity is a challenge.\n\n300\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:43.120\nLet's say I have an external drive,\nright, and it's got sensitive data on it.\n\n301\n00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.260\nMaybe it's a USB key or\nmy time machine backup, sensitive data.\n\n302\n00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.680\nWhen I plug it into the computer,\n\n303\n00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.110\neverybody who's logged\nin has access to it.\n\n304\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.930\nI'm logged in, so I have access to it, but\n\n305\n00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:58.250\nthen if we switch over to Zach's account,\nhe has access to it also.\n\n306\n00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.930\nAnd that's even true with encrypted disks.\n\n307\n00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:06.930\nIf I take a USB key and\nI format it Mac OS Extended Journaled,\n\n308\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:11.180\nEncrypted, I encrypt it, then it's\ngonna require a pass key to use it.\n\n309\n00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.210\nAnd if I plug that disk in,\nit's gonna prompt me for that pass key.\n\n310\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.720\nI'm gonna type it in and\nnow I've unlocked the disk, right.\n\n311\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.595\nIf I walk away from the computer and\nZach does fast user switching over to him,\n\n312\n00:15:22.595 --> 00:15:26.206\nhe will see the disk and\nit's already unlocked, right.\n\n313\n00:15:26.206 --> 00:15:28.180\nCuz I unlocked it and\nI haven't logged out.\n\n314\n00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.700\nIt stays unlocked.\n\n315\n00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:34.420\nSo now he might get access to data\nthat I normally store encrypted, but\n\n316\n00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.340\nI've unlocked it, I've shared that key.\n\n317\n00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.860\nSo we have to be careful there, too.\n\n318\n00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.390\nSo from a security standpoint,\nthere's a little bit that we give away.\n\n319\n00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.550\nFrom a performance standpoint,\nthere's a little bit.\n\n320\n00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.500\nBut in the case of like a family computer,\n\n321\n00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.040\na home computer,\nthat's not normally an issue.\n\n322\n00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.569\nWith an encrypted disk, I just need to\nmake sure I lock it again before I walk\n\n323\n00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:53.886\naway or take it with me, but it is\nan extra concern that we have to have.\n\n324\n00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:57.070\n&gt;&gt; And speaking of family, is there a way\nfor parents to have control over their\n\n325\n00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.256\nchildren's accounts, or young ones-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n326\n00:15:59.256 --> 00:16:00.117\n&gt;&gt; Whatever the case may be?\n\n327\n00:16:00.117 --> 00:16:03.692\nWe talked briefly about managed\naccounts in an earlier episode,\n\n328\n00:16:03.692 --> 00:16:06.350\nwe talked about parental controls, right?\n\n329\n00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.530\nWith fast user switching and\nmultiple user accounts,\n\n330\n00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.500\nthe biggest example is the family.\n\n331\n00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.590\nSo you have parents and you have children.\n\n332\n00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.920\nAnd the parents have accounts that\nare usually like administrators and\n\n333\n00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.730\nthe children have accounts\nthat are regular users, right?\n\n334\n00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.600\nBut as an administrator, the parents can\nactually control a lot more over what\n\n335\n00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.520\nthe children's accounts can do,\nthanks to parental controls.\n\n336\n00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.030\nSo let's say, we'll switch back to,\nI'm still on my account, right?\n\n337\n00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.130\nSo I'm on my account.\n\n338\n00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:34.152\nAnd maybe I decide that Zach is a child.\n\n339\n00:16:34.152 --> 00:16:36.890\nAnd [LAUGH] so I-\n&gt;&gt; I'm only three and a half years old.\n\n340\n00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:37.650\n&gt;&gt; I need to.\n\n341\n00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:38.740\n&gt;&gt; A little big for my age.\n\n342\n00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:43.081\n&gt;&gt; I need to get a handle on young\nZachary's activities here, right?\n\n343\n00:16:43.081 --> 00:16:46.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So let me do this.\n\n344\n00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.632\nActually, I do need to log him out first.\n\n345\n00:16:48.632 --> 00:16:53.474\nIt's really hard to enable restrictions\non a user that's currently logged in.\n\n346\n00:16:53.474 --> 00:16:54.159\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n347\n00:16:54.159 --> 00:16:58.130\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna switch back over to\nZach for a moment and we'll log him out.\n\n348\n00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.240\nAnd you would need to do this yourself, if\nyou were gonna configure these options for\n\n349\n00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.540\none of your kids' accounts.\n\n350\n00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.530\nYou would just need to make sure\nthat you log them out first.\n\n351\n00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.630\nAnd so once it,\nI have no idea what I just did.\n\n352\n00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.950\nOnce he's logged out,\nthere we go, log out.\n\n353\n00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:15.400\nOkay, then I can switch\nback over to my account and\n\n354\n00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.340\nI can enable parental controls.\n\n355\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.160\nRight?\n\n356\n00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:24.490\nAnd so that's easy enough inside of\nthe users in group System Preference.\n\n357\n00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:25.690\nIt's really just a check mark.\n\n358\n00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.660\nWhen you create a new account,\nyou can set it then.\n\n359\n00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.860\nBut if you decide to set it later,\nyou certainly can.\n\n360\n00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.670\nYou're just a check mark\naway from getting it done.\n\n361\n00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.120\nSo, I'm gonna come in here and\ntake Zach's account.\n\n362\n00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.210\nAnd let's see.\n\n363\n00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.060\nHave forwarding unlocked.\n\n364\n00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.770\nAgain, another nice thing\nis I never logged out.\n\n365\n00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.790\nSo, these panels that unlock that is still\nunlock for me versus if I logged I have\n\n366\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.320\nto log back in and re unlock them but\nI'm gonna be enable parental controls.\n\n367\n00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.310\nNow, when I turn that on, what happens?\n\n368\n00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.130\nWell, if you watch the episode\nright created accounts,\n\n369\n00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.610\nif I turn it on then,\nit ask me how old Zach was.\n\n370\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.850\nAnd I can pick an age, right?\n\n371\n00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.040\nHere it didn't.\n\n372\n00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.980\nDidn't ask, right?\n\n373\n00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.550\nSo I need to go a step further and\ngo into open parental controls.\n\n374\n00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.420\nAnd in here, I can start to\ntweak the settings and I haven't\n\n375\n00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.880\nunlocked this panel yet, so I'll need\nto provide my administrative password.\n\n376\n00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.300\nAnd now I can choose each account.\n\n377\n00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.190\nAnd start to customize the settings\non each individual account.\n\n378\n00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.380\nUp to me how I want to set this up.\n\n379\n00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.500\nSo for example, I might say for\n\n380\n00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.270\nZach, I don't want you to\nbe able to use the camera.\n\n381\n00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.920\nGame center is okay but\nmulti-player games,\n\n382\n00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.170\nmaybe I don't want you\ndoing online gaming, right?\n\n383\n00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.610\nCuz who knows what people chat about and\nstuff.\n\n384\n00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.990\nI could limit his email\nto only allowed contacts.\n\n385\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:47.540\nLet's let him email mom and dad,\ngrandma but not strangers, right?\n\n386\n00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.030\nWe want an approved list.\n\n387\n00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.530\nAnd if I check that off,\nI can go into manage and\n\n388\n00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.830\nactually make that list\nof approved addresses.\n\n389\n00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:53.540\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n390\n00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.770\n&gt;&gt; I can limit the applications\nhe's allowed to run, right?\n\n391\n00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:01.280\nMaybe I only want him to be\nable to run calculator, right?\n\n392\n00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.200\nSo, I come in here and\nyou have to be a little careful,\n\n393\n00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.060\nyou can be too restrictive sometimes.\n\n394\n00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.230\nBut maybe I don't want him running Safari.\n\n395\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:14.290\nSo I can come in here and find Safari,\ncheck our children from the web, right?\n\n396\n00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.425\nSo, I'll just turn Safari off, right?\n\n397\n00:19:16.425 --> 00:19:19.280\nSo I can do that now,\nhe's not allowed to run it.\n\n398\n00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.960\nOr let's do this different cuz I\nwanna show web restrictions and\n\n399\n00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.410\nif I turn that off I\nwon't be able to do it.\n\n400\n00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.850\nSo let's turn off actually\nlet's block calculator,\n\n401\n00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.640\nthe evilness that is the calculator.\n\n402\n00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.300\n&gt;&gt; That's evil.\n\n403\n00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.240\n&gt;&gt; You are not gonna be\nallowed to run the calculator.\n\n404\n00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.750\nSo, I'm picking and\nchoosing those aplications.\n\n405\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.568\nI can jump over to web and\nhere is where I can say, you now what,\n\n406\n00:19:39.568 --> 00:19:44.366\nI wanna restrict by age, so I want to\nlimit access to adult websites, right?\n\n407\n00:19:44.366 --> 00:19:49.040\nNotice it says, try to cuz new websites\npop up everyday, it's very hard for\n\n408\n00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.347\nApple to stay on top of that or I can\ndo better and do a white list and say,\n\n409\n00:19:53.347 --> 00:19:56.070\nthese are the sites\nhe's allowed to get to.\n\n410\n00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:00.611\nNow, this is cool because I can\nspecifically approve what he's allowed to\n\n411\n00:20:00.611 --> 00:20:04.760\nget to and if it's not in this list,\nhe can't get to it.\n\n412\n00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.940\nAnd it actually makes this\ninto like a bookmark bar for\n\n413\n00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.060\nhim, so he'll see the pages\nthat have been approved.\n\n414\n00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:15.290\nIf we look at the list here, I could\nadd in, I'll add in Cnn.com, right?\n\n415\n00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.590\nSo I want you to be able to get to CNN,\nright?\n\n416\n00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:24.720\nAnd so that's just cnn.com,\nwe'll punch that one in but\n\n417\n00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.320\nmaybe I'll leave off any other news sites.\n\n418\n00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.480\nSo like Reuters or\nFox News or somebody like.\n\n419\n00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.329\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Just CNN, that's what you get.\n\n420\n00:20:31.329 --> 00:20:33.960\nSo we can pick and\nchoose what those pages are.\n\n421\n00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.790\nNow, this does just apply to Safari.\n\n422\n00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.610\nSo if they install Chrome or\nFirefox, they could get around this.\n\n423\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:46.390\nBut back under Apps,\nI don't have to approve Firefox or Chrome.\n\n424\n00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.890\nI can make it where Safari is\nthe only approved web browser, so\n\n425\n00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.270\nthat's how we control it from that bypass.\n\n426\n00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.730\nI can enable or disable stores and\nhere's where the ages come in.\n\n427\n00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.480\nI can limit to apps that are rated for\na certain age.\n\n428\n00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.230\nThat's what that screen was asking\nwhen we created a new user account.\n\n429\n00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.840\nSo here is where I can set\nthat if I didn't do it before.\n\n430\n00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.250\nI can set time limits.\n\n431\n00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.130\nZach, you only get to use the computer for\ntwo hours a day.\n\n432\n00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:11.443\nOr only from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM\nbecause then it's dinner time and\n\n433\n00:21:11.443 --> 00:21:13.350\nyou do your homework, right?\n\n434\n00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.650\nI can start to define those\ntypes of restrictions.\n\n435\n00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.240\nWe can set privacy,\n\n436\n00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.940\nhow we want to protect data from\nbasically leaking out Diagnostics,\n\n437\n00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.860\nFacebook, Twitter, all those demographic\ntype things that collect user data.\n\n438\n00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.860\nAnd then we have a few miscellaneous\nsettings over here about like whether or\n\n439\n00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.940\nnot we want to allow Siri or\n\n440\n00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.460\nwhether we want to block explicit\nlanguage in the dictionary,\n\n441\n00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.690\nthese are all different options that\nwe can turn on to try and protect it.\n\n442\n00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.130\nThere's a simple finder\nthat makes the file system,\n\n443\n00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.840\nthe navigation of the file\nsystem far more easy.\n\n444\n00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.340\nSo there's a lot of stuff\nin here that you can tweak\n\n445\n00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.360\nto change that user's experience.\n\n446\n00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.640\nAnd once we get all that set up\nthe way that we want it, now,\n\n447\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.940\nwe have a pretty good kinda handle on,\non what that user is gonna experience and\n\n448\n00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.390\nwe know what they're,\nwhat they're gonna have.\n\n449\n00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:02.797\n&gt;&gt; But Don,\nI'm guessing you can log in as me, so\n\n450\n00:22:02.797 --> 00:22:04.364\nwe can see what this is\ngonna look like now, right?\n\n451\n00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:07.931\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is actually a combination\nof settings you can choose that nests\n\n452\n00:22:07.931 --> 00:22:11.064\nthings up pretty well but\nI think I've played it pretty safe here.\n\n453\n00:22:11.064 --> 00:22:15.723\nSo one thing we have to be careful with\nis if you do application restrictions and\n\n454\n00:22:15.723 --> 00:22:18.060\nyou lock somebody's abilities down.\n\n455\n00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.239\nAnd you do the simplified finder,\n\n456\n00:22:19.239 --> 00:22:21.358\nyou can actually end up with\na user interface with no options.\n\n457\n00:22:21.358 --> 00:22:22.333\nYou have to be careful with that.\n\n458\n00:22:22.333 --> 00:22:23.170\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n459\n00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.730\n&gt;&gt; But in our case, it's always a good\nidea to log in and test and see.\n\n460\n00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.280\nSo I'll log as Zach.\n\n461\n00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.590\nAnd let's see what his new\nuser experience is like.\n\n462\n00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:35.100\nNow, if I member some of the settings\nthat we changed, I did things like,\n\n463\n00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.240\nI said he can only run approved apps,\nright?\n\n464\n00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:42.290\nAnd Safari was an approved app,\ncalculator was not, right?\n\n465\n00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:46.380\nSo he should have been able to run\ncalculator before, now he can't.\n\n466\n00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.060\nNotice its taking a little while to login.\n\n467\n00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.050\nThis is the first time logging in\nsince turning on parental controls.\n\n468\n00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:53.962\nSo its taking a moment to get through and\ngenerate that and\n\n469\n00:22:53.962 --> 00:22:55.487\nthen apply the permissions.\n\n470\n00:22:55.487 --> 00:22:57.293\nYou already had Safari open and\n\n471\n00:22:57.293 --> 00:23:01.408\nwe had gone to Yahoo News because you\nsaid that was your favorite site.\n\n472\n00:23:01.408 --> 00:23:02.152\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we did.\n\n473\n00:23:02.152 --> 00:23:03.130\n&gt;&gt; That's not on the approved list.\n\n474\n00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:04.330\n&gt;&gt; It's not now.\n\n475\n00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.760\n&gt;&gt; And so here you get the block message.\n\n476\n00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.390\nAnd it's telling you hey, we're sorry.\n\n477\n00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.459\nYou're not allowed to view this site.\n\n478\n00:23:10.459 --> 00:23:14.697\nAnd it's giving you a list of\napproved sites right here.\n\n479\n00:23:14.697 --> 00:23:15.301\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n480\n00:23:15.301 --> 00:23:18.160\n&gt;&gt; Including CNN,\nwhich we did add to the list, right?\n\n481\n00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.310\nSo we can click on that one and\nit's gonna take us to CNN.com.\n\n482\n00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.420\nSo here we go.\n\n483\n00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.560\n&gt;&gt; I do like CNN too by the way.\n\n484\n00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.205\n&gt;&gt; I think all the news sites are all\nthe pretty much the same mess right now.\n\n485\n00:23:29.205 --> 00:23:32.290\n[LAUGH] If I try and\ngo to Fox News, then we get this.\n\n486\n00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:33.080\nWe're not allowed to get there.\n\n487\n00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:33.710\n&gt;&gt; Can't go there.\n\n488\n00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:37.680\n&gt;&gt; Our web browser experience\nis protected, right?\n\n489\n00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.050\nWe are seeing this kind of customized\nexperience and if I pull up my little bar\n\n490\n00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.873\nover here and look at my favorites and\nI browse into the favorites,\n\n491\n00:23:45.873 --> 00:23:50.745\nlook at the, oops, look at the favorites\nlist, the hardest part is clicking on it.\n\n492\n00:23:50.745 --> 00:23:53.815\nAnd you'll see the favorites are actually\nbuilt up of the approved website list.\n\n493\n00:23:53.815 --> 00:23:54.594\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n494\n00:23:54.594 --> 00:23:56.516\n&gt;&gt; And there's CNN right there,\nthat I added.\n\n495\n00:23:56.516 --> 00:23:58.417\nI didn't add it as a bookmark.\n\n496\n00:23:58.417 --> 00:23:59.802\nIt did it for me, right?\n\n497\n00:23:59.802 --> 00:24:03.430\nOn the application side, we're running\nSafari, which we were allowed to.\n\n498\n00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.180\nLet's run the calculator, right?\n\n499\n00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.741\nSo I'm gonna run the calculator and\nfire that up.\n\n500\n00:24:07.741 --> 00:24:11.220\n&gt;&gt; Or, no I'm not the application\ncalculator can't be opened Is the error\n\n501\n00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.367\nthat I get, right?\n\n502\n00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:14.315\n&gt;&gt; Boy, how about an abacus?\n\n503\n00:24:14.315 --> 00:24:15.165\nCan we do that?\n\n504\n00:24:15.165 --> 00:24:16.588\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You’ve got to use an abacus.\n\n505\n00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:18.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then in the background here,\n\n506\n00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.270\nit is telling me that I don’t\nhave permissions, right?\n\n507\n00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:22.871\nNow, what does it mean by\nI don’t have permissions?\n\n508\n00:24:22.871 --> 00:24:24.785\nWell, it is blocked, right?\n\n509\n00:24:24.785 --> 00:24:27.155\nBut, if this is your kid,\nthey can come to you and\n\n510\n00:24:27.155 --> 00:24:31.015\nsay, hey Dad,\ncan you let me use the calculator?\n\n511\n00:24:31.015 --> 00:24:35.140\nOr hey mom, I need to go to this\nwebsite can you help me get to it?\n\n512\n00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:39.209\nAnd as an administrator, we can come\nup and you've got the option to say,\n\n513\n00:24:39.209 --> 00:24:39.938\nallow once.\n\n514\n00:24:39.938 --> 00:24:42.720\nWe can authorize it right now\nwhile we're standing there.\n\n515\n00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.430\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n516\n00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.120\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen when we're done we can close it and\n\n517\n00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.410\nwalk away knowing that it can't just\nlaunch it again and use it, right.\n\n518\n00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:53.028\nSupervised access that's the best\nway to protect your children.\n\n519\n00:24:53.028 --> 00:24:55.613\nOr lock them in the basement\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n520\n00:24:55.613 --> 00:24:57.010\n&gt;&gt; What we could do is to always allow.\n\n521\n00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.580\nMaybe it's a new program that is installed\nand you want them to be able to use it.\n\n522\n00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.860\nThis is an easy way to\nquickly add it to the list,\n\n523\n00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.720\nI don't have to log out and\nlog in as an admin, add this to a list.\n\n524\n00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.116\nI can just do it right here by clicking\nthat, so really easy to do and\n\n525\n00:25:08.116 --> 00:25:09.036\nget put in place.\n\n526\n00:25:09.036 --> 00:25:11.046\nBut in this case, they’re blocked.\n\n527\n00:25:11.046 --> 00:25:13.200\nWant them to be blocked,\nand that’s fine, right?\n\n528\n00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.120\nSo that’s how those parental control\nwork and they give you a lot\n\n529\n00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.707\nof control over the experience-\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n530\n00:25:17.707 --> 00:25:22.655\n&gt;&gt; Of that user, and it's another reason\nwhy we want to have multiple user accounts\n\n531\n00:25:22.655 --> 00:25:27.020\nbecause I don’t want to give a child,\nwho should have limited access,\n\n532\n00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.797\nmy administrator account.\n\n533\n00:25:28.797 --> 00:25:30.097\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; That’s a recipe for disaster.\n\n534\n00:25:30.097 --> 00:25:31.930\nThey can install whatever they want.\n\n535\n00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:36.840\nI want it to be protected, secured,\nand parental controls let me do that.\n\n536\n00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.800\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful episode as always,\nmultiple user accounts and\n\n537\n00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.800\nbefore we move on, Don,\nwould you like to say something else?\n\n538\n00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.740\n&gt;&gt; You know, one thing to keep in mind\nwith multiple user accounts is that there\n\n539\n00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.225\nare some programs that don't\nplay real nice with it.\n\n540\n00:25:51.225 --> 00:25:53.720\nYou get what are called contention issues.\n\n541\n00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.329\nSo I don't think they make QuickBooks for\nMac anymore, but\n\n542\n00:25:57.329 --> 00:26:01.230\nit was a really big culprit of this where-\n&gt;&gt; I remember QuickBooks, yeah.\n\n543\n00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:04.922\n&gt;&gt; If I had QuickBooks open and\nthen I fast user switch and\n\n544\n00:26:04.922 --> 00:26:09.612\nsomebody else open up QuickBooks,\nit really, really hated that.\n\n545\n00:26:09.612 --> 00:26:12.608\nAnd sometimes it would corrupt\nyour data which is really bad,\n\n546\n00:26:12.608 --> 00:26:15.930\nsometimes it just wouldn't run,\nit just didn't like it.\n\n547\n00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:19.400\nA lot of database software\ndoesn't like that.\n\n548\n00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.940\nSo be careful,\nif you're using Apple applications,\n\n549\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.998\nones that are in the app store,\nthose are not a big deal.\n\n550\n00:26:24.998 --> 00:26:30.559\nBut third-party software sometimes is not\nwritten to run more than once at a time.\n\n551\n00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:32.452\nAnd so you can encounter that.\n\n552\n00:26:32.452 --> 00:26:33.990\nSo be on the lookout.\n\n553\n00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:39.790\nI see it with educational software\na lot sadly your kids go to school and\n\n554\n00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.020\nthe teacher sends home a note.\n\n555\n00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.820\nHey, we bought a license for\nthis software,\n\n556\n00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.560\nyou can install it on\nyour computer at home.\n\n557\n00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.016\nAnd it's only designed to be run once.\n\n558\n00:26:47.016 --> 00:26:50.205\nSo if you run it on one account and\ntry it on another, it's a problem.\n\n559\n00:26:50.205 --> 00:26:53.580\nSo just keep an eye out for that and\nyou can close the application.\n\n560\n00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.720\nExcept for one user, and\nthen that kind of solves that problem.\n\n561\n00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.730\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, very much, Don.\n\n562\n00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.050\nYou are watching the Apple Certified\nSupport Professional series of episodes.\n\n563\n00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.457\nMake sure you watch all of them\nbecause Don's doing a great job.\n\n564\n00:27:03.457 -->

ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:16.385\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:19.445\nI'm your host for this episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional,\n\n8\n00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:22.275\nthe title of this episode\nis User Account Security.\n\n9\n00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:23.745\nGot to know about security, right?\n\n10\n00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:25.035\nAnd Don Pezet is here to help us out.\n\n11\n00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:27.845\nDon, great to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach, thanks for bringing me back.\n\n12\n00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:28.690\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n\n13\n00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.135\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've been talking about\n\n14\n00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:32.495\nuser accounts for several episodes.\n\n15\n00:00:32.495 --> 00:00:34.705\nAnd I'm sure some of you out\nthere are thinking, man,\n\n16\n00:00:34.705 --> 00:00:37.270\nhow much more can we learn\nabout stinking user accounts?\n\n17\n00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.050\nWell in this episode I want to shift it\njust a little bit and talk about some of\n\n18\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.390\nthe security features that are available\nto help us protect our user accounts,\n\n19\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.810\nprotect our computer, and some things we\nneed to remember as we're setting up,\n\n20\n00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.650\nespecially as we're\nsetting up a new system,\n\n21\n00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.090\nto help protect that customer data.\n\n22\n00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.960\nSo that's what we're gonna be looking\nat right here in User Account Security.\n\n23\n00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.560\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\n\n24\n00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.970\nwhich security features\nshould we start with?\n\n25\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.100\nLet's start with a neat one.\n\n26\n00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.060\nOne that I know a lot of people don't take\nadvantage of and I think they should.\n\n27\n00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.700\nThere is a feature built into every\nMac called a firmware password.\n\n28\n00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.310\nNow we have already seen user passwords,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.770\nSo when I log into the computer I have\nto provide my username and a password.\n\n30\n00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.510\nA firmware password is a second password.\n\n31\n00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.580\nRight?\nAnd it might sound kind of annoying but\n\n32\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.390\nthis one is actually pretty painless.\n\n33\n00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.000\nWhat we can do is we can apply\na firmware password that applies to\n\n34\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.420\nthe hardware of the Mac.\n\n35\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.100\nWhen you push the power button, you've\ngot to be authorized to boot that Mac up.\n\n36\n00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.910\nAnd if you aren't,\nthen you can't boot it, right?\n\n37\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.820\nThis helps protect us in the event\nthat our hardware is stolen.\n\n38\n00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.220\nLet me give you a scenario here,\nlet's say that I've got a username and\n\n39\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.130\na password on my computer, right?\n\n40\n00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.020\nSo somebody comes and\nthey steal my computer.\n\n41\n00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.500\nAnd they don't care about my data,\nthey just want the computer.\n\n42\n00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.381\nThey can take it, they can format it,\nlike we did in episode number two and\n\n43\n00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:55.620\ninstall MacOS, if they watched our episode\n[LAUGH] and figure out how to do that.\n\n44\n00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.000\nAnd once it's formatted and\nreset it's got MacOS running on it,\n\n45\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.480\nthey can go sell it on eBay or\nwhatever it is they want to do,\n\n46\n00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.260\nand they can make some money and\noff they go, right?\n\n47\n00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.450\nSo, they're able to use the hardware\neven though all my data was safe.\n\n48\n00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.730\nRight?\nThey didn't get at my data,\n\n49\n00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.810\nit was protected with a password.\n\n50\n00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.870\nThey were still able to steal\nthe hardware and make it useful.\n\n51\n00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.050\nA firmware password prevents that.\n\n52\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.580\nWith a firmware password,\nif you boot your system and\n\n53\n00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.590\nboot into the regular OS,\nyou never see the firmware password.\n\n54\n00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.990\nIt just takes you right into the OS,\nyou punch in your username and\n\n55\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.470\nyour password, and there you go.\n\n56\n00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.180\nBut if you try to bypass that process\nin any way, if you put in a new,\n\n57\n00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.030\nblank hard drive.\n\n58\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.240\nIf you try and boot from a USB key,\nif you try to do internet recovery.\n\n59\n00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.740\nIf you try to do any of those things,\nit presents you with a firmware password\n\n60\n00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.400\nprompt.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n61\n00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.480\n&gt;&gt; And you've gotta clear that prompt\n\n62\n00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.380\nbefore you can get beyond that, all right?\n\n63\n00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.885\nNow in order to see that process,\nit's kind of an interesting one.\n\n64\n00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:53.440\n'Cause this password's\na part of the hardware.\n\n65\n00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.690\nSo when we're booted into\nour operating system,\n\n66\n00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.290\nwe don't have the ability\nto set a firmware password.\n\n67\n00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.210\nSo we don't see this option.\n\n68\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.720\nIn all the screens we saw in\nthe earlier episodes, we didn't see it.\n\n69\n00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.230\nWe have to boot to recovery and once\nwe're in recovery, then we can go in and\n\n70\n00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.320\nset that tool.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n71\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.031\nDon, how do we boot into recovery?\n&gt;&gt; Good question 'cause we haven't seen\n\n72\n00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:14.330\nrecovery mode in this series yet.\n\n73\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.220\nThe recovery mode is a special little\nsystem we can boot into that isn't\n\n74\n00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.680\nusing our main operating system.\n\n75\n00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.020\nIt takes it offline and\nlets us fix things.\n\n76\n00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.520\nAnd let's just set that firmware password,\n\n77\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.070\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n78\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.220\n&gt;&gt; So the way to do it is, first,\n\n79\n00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.480\nI'm gonna need to shut down my machine.\n\n80\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.850\nSo I'm gonna shut down my Mac.\n\n81\n00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.520\nI'll just hit my little Apple\nicon here and go to shutdown.\n\n82\n00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.060\nOnce it shuts down, so\nit's gonna power completely off, right?\n\n83\n00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.840\nOn my keyboard, I'm gonna hold Command R.\n\n84\n00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.040\nCommand R and\nyou can remember R for recovery.\n\n85\n00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.640\nSo I'm gonna hold Command R.\n\n86\n00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.480\nAnd I'm gonna have to duck down by\nthe podium here to hit my power button.\n\n87\n00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.150\nLet's just do that.\n\n88\n00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.340\nAnd so while I'm holding Command R,\nI hit the power button,\n\n89\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.430\nI could hear the Mac chime there.\n&gt;&gt; Yes indeed.\n\n90\n00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.450\n&gt;&gt; And it's gonna start to boot, okay?\n\n91\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.650\nNow normally when we boot,\nwe see a little Apple icon,\n\n92\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.170\na little white bar goes by pretty quick.\n\n93\n00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.440\nAnd then we boot them and we're in.\n\n94\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.610\nWhen we boot to recovery,\nit's just a little bit different, right?\n\n95\n00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.270\nWe are going to see the Apple appear and\n\n96\n00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.300\nwe're going to see that\nbar start to crawl across.\n\n97\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.950\nBut a little bit slower than\nwhat we're used to, okay.\n\n98\n00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.330\nWhat's going on and as soon as you see\nthe little white bar you can let go, so\n\n99\n00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.600\nI just let go of the main bar.\n\n100\n00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.260\nSo what's going is that when you format\nyour hard drive and install MacOS,\n\n101\n00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.930\nmost of the hard drive is taken up by your\nregular operating system, what you use.\n\n102\n00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.040\nBut there's a little hidden partition.\n\n103\n00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.840\nIt's about six gigs in size and\nit puts a copy of the Mac OS recovery\n\n104\n00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.850\nsystem in there and\nthe entire Mac OS installer.\n\n105\n00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.990\nAnd that way we can resinstall\nthe entire operating system from that\n\n106\n00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.630\nlittle partition if we want.\n\n107\n00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.320\nThat won't protect us from\na failed hard drive but it\n\n108\n00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.140\nwould protect us from a corrupt operating\nsystem or damaged files and so on.\n\n109\n00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.510\nBut in order to repair\nan operating system,\n\n110\n00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.250\nyou can't be running it at the same time.\n\n111\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.750\nSo this is a second copy.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n112\n00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.000\n&gt;&gt; And when I boot into this mode,\n\n113\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.450\nI'll be able to do a couple of things.\n\n114\n00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.210\nAnd while we're waiting on this\n\n115\n00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.590\nlet me just kind of highlight\nsome of the features of recovery.\n\n116\n00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.230\nWe've got the firmware\npassword utility is in there.\n\n117\n00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.730\nThere is a terminal that we can\ndrop to to run BSD Unix commands.\n\n118\n00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.240\nAnd then there is a number of other\nutilities that is centered on\n\n119\n00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.360\nDisk Help, right?\n\n120\n00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.110\nAnd actually it's already up.\n\n121\n00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.890\nI can see Disk Utility there for\nformatting datas,\n\n122\n00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.200\nto running first aid repair,\nwe'll see those in other episodes.\n\n123\n00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.290\nI can reinstall Mac OS and\nso on, all right.\n\n124\n00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.930\nWhat I want though is\nthat firmware utility.\n\n125\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.110\nAnd you'll notice the firmware\nutility is not here in the main list.\n\n126\n00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.820\nAnd I apologize in advance,\nI can't zoom in when I'm in recovery.\n\n127\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.550\nIt doesn't have the full feature set.\n\n128\n00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.520\nMy zoom feature that I use is actually a\npart of the accessibility feature set and\n\n129\n00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.400\nit's not present when you're\nin recovery which seems odd.\n\n130\n00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.490\nThey should have that but they don't.\n\n131\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.250\nSo where is this firmware utility?\n\n132\n00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.780\nUp top in our menu,\nyou'll notice a menu label Utilities and\n\n133\n00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.850\nit's gonna be kind of small,\nbut it's up there.\n\n134\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.040\nAnd if I go to Utilities, you'll see\nthree things stuck under there, right?\n\n135\n00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.010\nWe've got the terminal that I mentioned,\nthere's a network utility which is useful\n\n136\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.860\nfor troubleshooting network access and\nthere's the boot security utility.\n\n137\n00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.670\nThat's the utility that let's us set\n\n138\n00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.480\na firmware password.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n139\n00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.210\n&gt;&gt; And when it comes up,\n\n140\n00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.790\nit only gives you one option.\n\n141\n00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.260\nTo turn on a firmware password.\n\n142\n00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.530\nI don't have a firmware password right\nnow so I can turn one on if I want.\n\n143\n00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.460\nI'll go ahead and turn that on.\n\n144\n00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.290\nAnd when I do that, it's just going to\nask me what the password is going to be.\n\n145\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.390\nI'll type in what I want it to be.\n\n146\n00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.240\nAnd you type it twice so\nyou make sure you don't forget it.\n\n147\n00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.060\nNow that's important because-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah here we go.\n\n148\n00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.520\n&gt;&gt; Zach do you know what we have to do if\n\n149\n00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.230\nwe forget what this password is?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n150\n00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.790\nYou have to go to Apple.\n\n151\n00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.725\nBut that's not even sure.\n\n152\n00:06:42.725 --> 00:06:44.820\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that is exactly right.\n\n153\n00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.190\nThere's no way to reset this.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n154\n00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.780\n&gt;&gt; Right if you forget this password\n\n155\n00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.290\n&gt;&gt; If you could reset it,\n\n156\n00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.540\nthen a thief could as well.\n\n157\n00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.270\nSo you break the protection.\n&gt;&gt; This is the ultimate\n\n158\n00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.190\nsecurity.\n&gt;&gt; And if you forget it, the way to fix it\n\n159\n00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.360\nis exactly what Zach said, is we have to\ntake our Mac down to the Apple store.\n\n160\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.890\nAnd you've got to have a receipt with you\nthat shows that you purchased that unit or\n\n161\n00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.610\nthe serial number needs to\nbe registered to you or\n\n162\n00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.060\nApple Care needs to registered to you.\n\n163\n00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.470\nYou have to prove that you're\nthe owner if this is a used Mac, or\n\n164\n00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.690\nyou got it from a family member,\n\n165\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.655\nthey will not reset it for you.\n\n166\n00:07:13.655 --> 00:07:15.140\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n167\n00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.890\nIf you Google around on the internet\nyou'll find where people post instructions\n\n168\n00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:18.990\non how to reset it.\n\n169\n00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.330\nThat stopped working with\nevery Mac made since 2012.\n\n170\n00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.370\nSo any Mac made in the last\nsix years doesn't work,\n\n171\n00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.330\nso pretty much it just doesn't\nwork on Macs at all anymore.\n\n172\n00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.720\nSo but once that's set, I'm good there.\n\n173\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.900\nI can hit Quit Boot Security Utility.\n\n174\n00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.510\nAnd now I've got a firmware password,\nright?\n\n175\n00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.250\nWell, let's see what that looks like,\nall right?\n\n176\n00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.960\nI'm gonna go ahead and shut down.\n\n177\n00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.810\nSo we'll just power off.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n178\n00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.390\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n179\n00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.770\nonce it powers off,\nI'm gonna power back on.\n\n180\n00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.010\nNow some of you are probably thinking,\nboy, this is yet\n\n181\n00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.360\nanother password to remember, right?\n\n182\n00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.760\nI'm gonna power on.\n\n183\n00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.480\nI'm gonna have to provide\na firmware password.\n\n184\n00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.220\nThen I have to provide my username and\npassword.\n\n185\n00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.848\nIt's a hassle.\n\n186\n00:07:54.848 --> 00:08:00.533\nWell if you power on and boot from the\nnormal operating system, so not recovery,\n\n187\n00:08:00.533 --> 00:08:06.396\njust boot into the normal OS It doesn't\nask you for the firmware password, right?\n\n188\n00:08:06.396 --> 00:08:11.245\nNow, that might sound like a weakness but\nthe reality is, it's gonna take me to this\n\n189\n00:08:11.245 --> 00:08:16.870\nlog in screen, when I boot to a normal OS,\nI still have to have a password to get in.\n\n190\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.140\nSo if I stole this computer, I can't\nuse it unless I have a password here,\n\n191\n00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.380\nall right?\n\n192\n00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.120\nBut if I try and bypass the boot-up, so\n\n193\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.260\nI maybe I plug in a USB drive and I wanna\nboot from an alternate disk, all right.\n\n194\n00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.800\nSo we would do that by holding\nthe option key while we boot.\n\n195\n00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.650\nSo I'm gonna shut this down again,\nsoon as my magic touchpad syncs.\n\n196\n00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.580\nThere we go.\nSo I'll shut that down.\n\n197\n00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.980\nAnd as that's gonna power off,\nin any moment that will go.\n\n198\n00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:44.790\nThere we go.\n\n199\n00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.140\nSorry, my screen's kinda glitching\na bit there cuz I powered it off.\n\n200\n00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.920\nBut I'm gonna hold down that option\nkey while I push the power button, and\n\n201\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.372\nthe screen's gonna go black, right?\n\n202\n00:08:55.372 --> 00:08:59.140\nAnd then, what would normally happen\nis I would see the apple, and\n\n203\n00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.200\nthe little white bar.\n\n204\n00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.510\nOr if I'm holding the option key,\nlike I am right now,\n\n205\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.170\nI would see a list of each of my disks.\n\n206\n00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.730\nSo that I could pick which disk\nI wanted to boot from, right?\n\n207\n00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.500\nBut I have a firmware password now, and\nwith a firmware password, if I try and\n\n208\n00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.250\nbypass, I get this right here.\n&gt;&gt; Aha.\n\n209\n00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:17.900\n&gt;&gt; I have to provide\n\n210\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.010\nthe firmware password.\n\n211\n00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.500\nIt will not let me bypass the normal\nboot method without this password.\n\n212\n00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.280\nSo if somebody steals this computer and\nthey format the hard drive or\n\n213\n00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.210\nput in a different hard drive or\ntry to do it from the USB key, they can’t.\n\n214\n00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.800\nIt won’t let them.\n\n215\n00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.690\nThe hardware is effectively useless,\nand they can’t take it to Apple and\n\n216\n00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:40.980\nreset it, and so now they’ve stolen\na worthless piece of equipment.\n\n217\n00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.200\nIt wasn’t hard to set this\nonce you get it in place.\n\n218\n00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.900\nIt’s there and now I get my boot menu.\n\n219\n00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.110\nI can pick what I want to boot from, and\n\n220\n00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:54.270\nI can choose just to boot from a regular\ndrive, or boot from internet recovery,\n\n221\n00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.240\nor boot from a USB key or whatever\nit is I want and go about my life.\n\n222\n00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.320\nBut it’s nice for you it doesn’t really\ninconvenience you you don’t really see\n\n223\n00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.740\nthe firmware password unless you’re trying\nto bypass that normal boot process.\n\n224\n00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.050\n&gt;&gt; And Don, what about user passwords?\n\n225\n00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.860\nCan they be posted here as well?\n&gt;&gt; User passwords,\n\n226\n00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.320\nif I forget my firmware password, I've\ngotta take it down to the Apple Store.\n\n227\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.240\nBut If I forget my user password,\n\n228\n00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.590\nI don't necessarily need to take\nit down to the Apple Store.\n\n229\n00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.000\nWe can actually reset the passwords a few\ndifferent ways from within the system.\n\n230\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.540\nFor example, if I'm a regular user, right?\n\n231\n00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.390\nSo I'm just regular Joe user on this\nsystem and I forget my password.\n\n232\n00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.970\nI can contact an administrator and\nsay, hey, administrator.\n\n233\n00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.790\nCould you reset my password for me?\n\n234\n00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.150\nI forgot, right?\n\n235\n00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.660\nAnd the administrator can come in here and\nthey can go into the System Preferences.\n\n236\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.960\nAnd they can go into Users &amp; Groups.\n\n237\n00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.990\nAnd once they're in Users &amp; Groups,\n\n238\n00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.870\nthey can find the user\nthat they want to repair.\n\n239\n00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:57.490\nAnd when they click on another user,\nthey'll see a reset password link, right?\n\n240\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.610\nActually, I deleted my other user.\n\n241\n00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.450\nSo let me, I'll add a user here.\n\n242\n00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.421\nSo I'm gonna add a user for Zach.\n\n243\n00:11:08.693 --> 00:11:12.050\nAnd I'll set his password\nto something super secret.\n\n244\n00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.270\nAnd so now he's got an account, right?\n\n245\n00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:19.050\nAnd if he forgets his password,\nhe can ask me and I can come in here and\n\n246\n00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.110\npick his account, and\nI've got reset password right there.\n\n247\n00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:26.660\nI can reset it, change it to\nsomething else and that's that, okay.\n\n248\n00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.690\nBut, what if it's not the regular\nuser that forgets their password?\n\n249\n00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.860\nWhat if it's the administrator?\n&gt;&gt; Boy.\n\n250\n00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.220\n&gt;&gt; What if I forget my password,\n\n251\n00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.250\nwho am I gonna call?\n\n252\n00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.110\nThe Ghostbusters.\n\n253\n00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.822\n&gt;&gt; Ghostbusters.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n254\n00:11:38.822 --> 00:11:39.880\nExactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I knew that's\n\n255\n00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.310\nwhat you were gonna say.\n&gt;&gt; It's a given, right?\n\n256\n00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.100\nSee?\n\n257\n00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.970\nIf we can't get them,\nthen we're left on our own.\n\n258\n00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.340\nHow are we gonna reset that password.\n\n259\n00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.240\nAnd the short answer there is that\nyou actually can't through the GUI,\n\n260\n00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.740\nbut you can back through recovery, right?\n\n261\n00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.490\nSo, I'm gonna jump back to recovery again.\n\n262\n00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.400\nSo, I'm gonna shut this down.\n\n263\n00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.580\nPower off.\n\n264\n00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.130\nAnd I'm going to boot by holding\nthat Alt key down on my keyboard,\n\n265\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:08.640\nthe option key, or I'm sorry,\nI don't want to pick a boot device.\n\n266\n00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.790\nI want to do command R\nto boot to recovery,\n\n267\n00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.546\nyou've got to use the right\nkeyboard sequence.\n\n268\n00:12:12.546 --> 00:12:17.480\nAnd [LAUGH] I'm going to hit command R and\npower on.\n\n269\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.920\nNow, I'm gonna try to boot to recovery.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n270\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.560\n&gt;&gt; But I've got\n\n271\n00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.080\na firmware password, right?\n\n272\n00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.160\nSo when I go to boot from recovery,\nwhat's it going to do?\n\n273\n00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.890\nWell, the recovery partition is\nactually on the hard drive, but\n\n274\n00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.730\nit is technically bypassing\nthe normal boot order.\n\n275\n00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.240\nSo, as I go to fire this up,\nit's gonna recognize what I'm doing.\n\n276\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.910\nAnd it's gonna prompt for\nthat firmware password.\n\n277\n00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.990\nYou wouldn't want a thief or\nsomebody to be able to boot to recovery\n\n278\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.410\ncuz then they could reinstall Mac OS and\nreset the password and get in.\n\n279\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:54.650\nSo I'm gonna fix that, and after that\nit's gonna start the recovery process.\n\n280\n00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:58.010\nAll right so I get my Apple, my little\nwhite bar it's gonna move a little slower\n\n281\n00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.530\nthan normal but\nI'm gonna boot into recovery.\n\n282\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.430\nNow, you might have noticed when\nwe were in recovery a moment ago,\n\n283\n00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.450\nthere really wasn't a menu option\nthat said reset a password, right?\n\n284\n00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.590\nEven up under the utilities menu,\nthere wasn't.\n\n285\n00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:12.410\nAnd that's because if it's\nan administrative account,\n\n286\n00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.230\nthey don't give you a GUI for it.\n\n287\n00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.530\nIt's a command line utility.\n\n288\n00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.810\nThe terminal that I highlighted.\n\n289\n00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.680\nWe're gonna have to go to that and\n\n290\n00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.330\nwe're gonna have to type a command\nto go ahead a reset that password.\n\n291\n00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.660\nNow the Command Line Utility, it works for\nadministrator accounts and it works for\n\n292\n00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.450\nregular user accounts.\n\n293\n00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.560\nYou could use it for everything, right?\n\n294\n00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.880\nBut if it's just a regular user\nit is easier to use the GUI.\n\n295\n00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.460\nSo that's what we normally use, right?\n\n296\n00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.790\nBut this Command Line Utility,\nit will work for anybody.\n\n297\n00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:40.090\nBasically, the utility it's self\nis just called reset password.\n\n298\n00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.880\nSo it is not very exciting.\n\n299\n00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.000\nBut you type reset password.\n\n300\n00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.750\nSo if you type it by it's\nself then it would work for\n\n301\n00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.540\nresetting that administrator account.\n\n302\n00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.650\nBut you can point it to other people.\n\n303\n00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.010\nWhen you run reset password,\nit's actually gonna launch a GUI.\n\n304\n00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.820\nSo it's a command line utility,\nbut it launches a GUI and\n\n305\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.160\nfrom there you can pick the user\nthat you want to reset.\n\n306\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.540\nAll right, so it looks like my\nrecovery finished booting and\n\n307\n00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.360\nI'm going to go up here to utilities and\nterminal, and\n\n308\n00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.730\ninside of the terminal which is\nmicroscopic, that I can zoom.\n\n309\n00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.160\nI'm just gonna type resetpassword.\n\n310\n00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.540\nNothing too crazy, resetpassword.\n\n311\n00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:24.690\nAnd at first it's gonna look like\nnothing happened, but there it goes.\n\n312\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.590\nIt’s actually launching the GUI.\n\n313\n00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:31.190\nNow I’ve made my window so\nbig you can’t see it, but there it is.\n\n314\n00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.400\nThere’s old reset password, and\nit’s going to list all the users.\n\n315\n00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.560\nSo there’s Zach, there’s me.\n\n316\n00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.190\nSo I can pick an administrator account and\nreset the password.\n\n317\n00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.870\nNow hopefully this highlights for\nyou how an attacker can use that.\n\n318\n00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.110\nI can steal zach’s laptop.\n\n319\n00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.100\nI don’t know his password.\n\n320\n00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.130\nI can run home, boot it to recovery,\nyou use the reset password command and\n\n321\n00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.430\nreset his password, and\nnow I can log in as him.\n\n322\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:59.370\nAnd when I log in as him,\nnow I've got all his data, right.\n\n323\n00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.310\nThis would be a big deal\nthe firmware password\n\n324\n00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.960\nis what protects from that, right.\n\n325\n00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.460\nSo using the two in\nconjunction user passwords and\n\n326\n00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:11.410\nfirmware passwords, that's going to\nensure that its not too easy to bypass\n\n327\n00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.430\nsomebody's security.\n&gt;&gt; Does a password reset cause any\n\n328\n00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.500\nproblems though?\n&gt;&gt; It can, yeah, absolutely.\n\n329\n00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.550\nYou know, I haven't talked\nabout the keychain at all yet.\n\n330\n00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.570\nWhen you're browsing the web.\n\n331\n00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.650\nAnd actually while I'm talking here,\nI'm gonna reset my password.\n\n332\n00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:29.770\nTo reset somebody's password you just\nclick on the account and you click next.\n\n333\n00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.030\nAnd then you provide what you\nwant their new password to be.\n\n334\n00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.810\nSo I will punch in a new password for it.\n\n335\n00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.610\nAnd it's gonna reset that password.\n\n336\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.420\nAnd you know,\nI wasn't I'm just looking very close.\n\n337\n00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.410\nI hope I typed that right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n338\n00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.550\n&gt;&gt; So I'm going,\n\n339\n00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.330\nactually you know what it's doing?\n\n340\n00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.800\nIt's saying that I'm tied\nto my iCloud account.\n\n341\n00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.460\nSo let me reset the account\nthat I made for you instead.\n\n342\n00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:52.960\n&gt;&gt; Okie-dokie.\n\n343\n00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.931\n&gt;&gt; ICloud adds a little extra complexity\n\n344\n00:15:54.931 --> 00:15:55.848\nto do this.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n345\n00:15:55.848 --> 00:15:58.200\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna come in here and I'll just\n\n346\n00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.992\npunch in that password that I want your\naccount to have now, your new password.\n\n347\n00:16:02.992 --> 00:16:06.204\nAnd I typed in the same password so\nit failed.\n\n348\n00:16:06.204 --> 00:16:10.482\nBut you do have to type in a different\npassword or it gets cranky with you and\n\n349\n00:16:10.482 --> 00:16:11.658\nthen it'll reset.\n\n350\n00:16:11.658 --> 00:16:13.685\nNow, when you change the password for\nthough,\n\n351\n00:16:13.685 --> 00:16:15.617\nthere's a thing called a Keychain, right?\n\n352\n00:16:15.617 --> 00:16:19.052\nAnd with the Keychain,\nhave you ever been to a website and\n\n353\n00:16:19.052 --> 00:16:22.058\nyour web browser says would\nyou like me to remember\n\n354\n00:16:22.058 --> 00:16:23.740\nthe password?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n355\n00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.970\n&gt;&gt; Or you browse to a network server and\n\n356\n00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.150\nit says do you wanna remember the session.\n\n357\n00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.510\nOkay, that kind of stuff.\n\n358\n00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.020\nWhere do those passwords go?\n\n359\n00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.680\nWell, in MAC OS they\ngo to the keychain and\n\n360\n00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.420\nthe keychain is keeping track of all that.\n\n361\n00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.934\nNow, if I reset Zack's password and\nthen I log in as him.\n\n362\n00:16:39.934 --> 00:16:43.927\nTechnically, I would have access\nto that whole key chain, right?\n\n363\n00:16:43.927 --> 00:16:45.590\nThat would be a lot of passwords.\n\n364\n00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.220\nPasswords beyond just this system.\n\n365\n00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.530\nThat would be bad.\n\n366\n00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.090\nSo Apple doesn’t allow that.\n\n367\n00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:55.640\nWhen you reset somebody’s password,\nit does not reset the keychain’s password.\n\n368\n00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.990\nIts password is still the password for\nthe old account.\n\n369\n00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:02.085\nSo, for example with my account here,\nas soon as my touch pad wakes up,\n\n370\n00:17:02.085 --> 00:17:02.850\nthere we go.\n\n371\n00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:07.530\nWith my account,\nif I log in with my password,\n\n372\n00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.160\nthe key chain has the same password.\n\n373\n00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.070\nSo if I fire up my spotlight and\nI type key chain,\n\n374\n00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:18.430\nthere's a utility called\nKey Chain Access and\n\n375\n00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:22.760\nwhen I run Key Chain Access it's gonna\nopen up and here's my Key Chain, right?\n\n376\n00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.210\nAnd it's gonna show websites,\nnetwork files servers and\n\n377\n00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:30.220\nother resources that I've accessed in\nthe credentials that are stored, right?\n\n378\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:34.990\nIt doesn't show the password but it shows\nthat I do have a password stored, right?\n\n379\n00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.750\nIt didn't ask me for\na password to get in here.\n\n380\n00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:44.320\nIn fact, when I launched Keychain access,\nit immediately came in and unlocked it.\n\n381\n00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.100\nKeychain is unlocked.\n\n382\n00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.530\nI can get at all my passwords.\n\n383\n00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.410\nBecause the passwords were the same.\n\n384\n00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.060\nIf I reset my password though,\nit doesn't match the Keychain anymore.\n\n385\n00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.380\nAnd the key chain will start locked.\n\n386\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.070\nRight?\n\n387\n00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.820\nAnd when the key chain is locked,\n\n388\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.230\nit's locked like this, you can't use\nthe passwords that are in there.\n\n389\n00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.060\nYou can't get at them.\n\n390\n00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.990\nYou can't see them and\naccess them and use them, right?\n\n391\n00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.390\nUntil it's unlocked.\n\n392\n00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.920\nBut if you try to unlock it, it's\ngoing to be tied to your old password.\n\n393\n00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.540\nWhich you don't remember.\n\n394\n00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.810\nIf you type in your new password and\npunch that in, it's not gonna work.\n\n395\n00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:17.610\nRight?\n\n396\n00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:22.210\nAnd so, after you do a password reset,\nthe first time you go to use one\n\n397\n00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:26.290\nof these stored passwords, the keychain is\ngoing to ask you to provide your password.\n\n398\n00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:31.050\nAnd if you don't know it,\nit'll offer to erase the keychain.\n\n399\n00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:32.620\nIt'll wipe out the passwords.\n\n400\n00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.250\nAnd that way you can start\nwith a new empty keychain.\n\n401\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.820\nAnd not worry about compromising\nthose other settings.\n\n402\n00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.270\nSo that is one thing we\nneed to be aware of.\n\n403\n00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.000\nIf you reset somebody's password and\n\n404\n00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.620\nthey genuinely don't know what it was,\nthen they're gonna lose all their stored\n\n405\n00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.050\npasswords that they might have done in\nSafari or in Finder or whatever, okay?\n\n406\n00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.780\nNow if you're leveraging some other\npassword database like Last Pass or\n\n407\n00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.390\nKey Pass or one of those guys.\n\n408\n00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.790\nThey are not affected by this, right?\n\n409\n00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.030\nThey have their own credentials.\n\n410\n00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.520\nBut the keychain is tied\nto your user credential.\n\n411\n00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.210\nSo that is just one thing that you\nneed to be aware of that will not be,\n\n412\n00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.110\nnot that one, we cancel that.\n\n413\n00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.860\nYeah, well,\nthatwas gonna force me to authenticate.\n\n414\n00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.530\nAnd if I get it wrong enough times\nthen it will erase my keychain.\n\n415\n00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.930\nBut that is one thing to be aware of when\nit comes to resetting these passwords.\n\n416\n00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:18.590\n&gt;&gt; Are there any other\n\n417\n00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:22.350\nways to reset a user's password?\n&gt;&gt; There's one more way and\n\n418\n00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.380\nwe sort of saw it a moment ago,\nwhen I tried to reset my account and\n\n419\n00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.700\nmy account was tied to iCloud, right?\n\n420\n00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.540\nAnd so, it was asking for\nmy iCloud password.\n\n421\n00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.630\nWhy is that?\n\n422\n00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:39.240\nWell, when you create a user account\nlike the account that I made for Zach.\n\n423\n00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.315\nI kind of breezed past it real quick when\nI created his account because I was in\n\n424\n00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:43.836\na hurry.\n\n425\n00:19:43.836 --> 00:19:48.306\nBut when you create the account,\nit actually gives you a little option\n\n426\n00:19:48.306 --> 00:19:52.871\nthat says allow iCloud to reset\nthe password for this account, right?\n\n427\n00:19:52.871 --> 00:19:58.460\nSo I’ll add another user, maybe I’ll\ncreate one for Ronnie or somebody.\n\n428\n00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.430\nOr actually you know what, it's not gonna\nshow it until he's joined the iCloud.\n\n429\n00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.230\nBut there is that option though,\nto show whether or\n\n430\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.870\nnot you actually joined the iCloud.\n\n431\n00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.980\nAnd if you are,\nyou can use iCloud to reset it.\n\n432\n00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.300\nSo, if you forget your\nlocal computer password,\n\n433\n00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:18.230\nall you have to do is basically\nprovide your iCloud identity.\n\n434\n00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.170\nAnd the password for\n\n435\n00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.680\nyour iCloud account and then that\nwill let you reset your local one.\n\n436\n00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.560\nMy account is tied to iCloud and\nso I see that option right here.\n\n437\n00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.270\nAllow user to reset password\nusing Apple ID, right?\n\n438\n00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:36.220\nNow, mine is not checked but\nwhen I booted to recovery and I did\n\n439\n00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.610\nthe reset password on my account, it asked\nfor the iCloud password didn't it, right?\n\n440\n00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:45.310\nSo, even when it's not said,\nit still recognizes as another option for\n\n441\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.870\nan administrator, right?\n\n442\n00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.940\nFor a regular users though,\nit wouldn't have done that.\n\n443\n00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.750\nIt wouldn't have given me that option,\nlike for Zach's account.\n\n444\n00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:52.880\nBut on mine it does.\n\n445\n00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.560\nIf I check that,\nthen it will always give me that option,\n\n446\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.420\nwhether I'm a regular user or an admin.\n\n447\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.640\nSo we can turn that option on.\n\n448\n00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:04.940\nNow, if I forget my password,\nI can boot to recovery and I can reset and\n\n449\n00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.430\nI can provide my iCloud credentials or\nmy Apple ID and now it'll unlock.\n\n450\n00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:12.720\nSo that's another step and it's one more\nstep in the direction of Apple saying,\n\n451\n00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.610\nlook, there's gonna come a time where you\ndon't have a local user account anymore,\n\n452\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.070\nyou just use your Apple ID to login.\n\n453\n00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.220\nThat's how the iOS devices already are.\n\n454\n00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.760\nThe iPhone and the iPad,\nthey've already done that.\n\n455\n00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.890\nMacOS is on it's way.\n\n456\n00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:26.280\nSo it'll be happening soon.\n\n457\n00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.410\nBut it hasn't happened yet.\n\n458\n00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:31.060\nThis is just saying,\nwe'll allow one to reset the other.\n\n459\n00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.720\n&gt;&gt; What other user security features\n\n460\n00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.730\nare available in macOS?\n&gt;&gt; There's a bunch.\n\n461\n00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.236\nThere's actually a lot of stuff that-\n&gt;&gt; I bet you there is.\n\n462\n00:21:39.236 --> 00:21:41.407\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We could probably do number\n\n463\n00:21:41.407 --> 00:21:42.438\nof series on.\n\n464\n00:21:42.438 --> 00:21:44.320\nBut let me just jump\nthrough a couple here.\n\n465\n00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.480\nPrivacy controls and Find My Mac,\n\n466\n00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.720\nthose are two features that are presented\nto us in the initial setup wizard.\n\n467\n00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.310\nAnd most people just click right past\nthem and don't even think about it.\n\n468\n00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:59.150\nBut let's say that we wanna go back and\nrevisit those settings and\n\n469\n00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.240\nfigure out whether or\nnot we set them the right way.\n\n470\n00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.600\nIn my System Preferences here,\n\n471\n00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:08.280\nI can go back and you've got your\nsecurity and privacy system preference.\n\n472\n00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.240\nAnd when you go in there, there's\nseveral things that you configure but\n\n473\n00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.060\nunder the general tab is\nwhere you'll see thing like,\n\n474\n00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.180\nwhether we're requiring a password\nif the screen goes to sleep.\n\n475\n00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:21.590\nAnd other settings there centered around\njust protecting our machine if we\n\n476\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.710\nwalk away from it.\n\n477\n00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.580\nBut you'll also see the Privacy tab.\n\n478\n00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.409\nAnd here's where I can control\nLocation Services, as well as other things\n\n479\n00:22:29.409 --> 00:22:33.270\nthat are being kind of being leaked\nout to the internet about me.\n\n480\n00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.840\nLocation Services are super\npopular these days.\n\n481\n00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.270\nThat when you go to a website and\nit's a weather website,\n\n482\n00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.580\nit wants to just automatically show\nyou the weather for your area.\n\n483\n00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:45.500\nBut it needs to know where you are to do\nthat, Location services let it do it but\n\n484\n00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.030\nyou may not want that, right?\n\n485\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.190\nI may want to turn that off and\n\n486\n00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:52.070\nyou can turn off location services if\nyou want to protect your location.\n\n487\n00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:54.640\nYou don't wanna share that\ninformation with Apple.\n\n488\n00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.300\nThat's a good feature.\n\n489\n00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:01.960\nBut there's another security feature\nthat relies on location services and\n\n490\n00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.180\nthat's called Find My Mac, right?\n\n491\n00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:09.020\nIf I lose my Mac, how can I find it again?\n\n492\n00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.910\nIf it gets stolen or\nI just can't remember where I put it.\n\n493\n00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.800\nWell, if you've logged into\nyour iCloud account, right?\n\n494\n00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:21.190\nWhen you connect into iCloud,\nit will add all of these various services.\n\n495\n00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:24.750\nAnd one of the services is Find My Mac.\n\n496\n00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.880\nFind My Mac says, all right, every now and\nthen your Mac is gonna phone home.\n\n497\n00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.140\nIt's gonna send a message back to\nApple saying hey, here's where I'm at.\n\n498\n00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.730\nAnd if I ever lose it,\nI can go to the iCloud website,\n\n499\n00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:41.560\nI can log in with my Apple ID and\nI can click Find My Mac and\n\n500\n00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.810\nit'll show me a nice little map with\na dot on it, right where my mac is.\n\n501\n00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:48.210\nAnd maybe, did I leave it at work or\nis at home?\n\n502\n00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.630\nI'll go to iCloud and\nI'll see where the dot is, right?\n\n503\n00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.232\nIt's not gonna tell me it's under\nthe couch in the living room.\n\n504\n00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:55.867\nBut it'll tell me it's at my house, right?\n\n505\n00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:58.684\nIf I think it was stolen and\nI pull it up and sure enough,\n\n506\n00:23:58.684 --> 00:24:02.381\nI see the dot going down the interstate\nIt's probably stolen, right?\n\n507\n00:24:02.381 --> 00:24:05.808\nWe can find that, but we need\nlocation services for that to work.\n\n508\n00:24:05.808 --> 00:24:09.290\nIf we turn off our GPS's\nreporting then that doesn't work.\n\n509\n00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.810\nNow, let me clarify that a little bit.\n\n510\n00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.090\nBecause most Macs don't\nhave a GPS in them.\n\n511\n00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.700\niPhone, iPad, they do, right?\n\n512\n00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.990\nBut an iMac doesn't have a GPS in it.\n\n513\n00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:22.897\nMy iMac Mini doesn't have a GPS in it.\n\n514\n00:24:22.897 --> 00:24:25.830\nSo if they get stolen, how does this work?\n\n515\n00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:31.720\nWell, Find My Mac actually leverages\nthe guest account on your system.\n\n516\n00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:36.670\nThe idea is that if somebody steals\nyour laptop and they power it on.\n\n517\n00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.900\nAnd it's got passwords on it,\nthey can't log in.\n\n518\n00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.663\nThen they're not gonna\nconnect it to the network.\n\n519\n00:24:40.663 --> 00:24:41.984\nThey can't connect to a wireless network.\n\n520\n00:24:41.984 --> 00:24:44.384\nIt's not letting them log in, right?\n\n521\n00:24:44.384 --> 00:24:47.467\nBut if we turn on the guest account,\nthey can log in as guest.\n\n522\n00:24:47.467 --> 00:24:48.492\nAnd connect to a wireless network.\n\n523\n00:24:48.492 --> 00:24:50.860\nMaybe they go to Starbucks and\nuse their wireless.\n\n524\n00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.648\nAnd at that point,\nyour laptop will phone home.\n\n525\n00:24:53.648 --> 00:24:55.599\nAnd it'll send a message back to Apple and\n\n526\n00:24:55.599 --> 00:24:57.950\nnow you'll be able to locate where it is,\nright?\n\n527\n00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:59.600\nBut it relies on that guest account.\n\n528\n00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:05.240\nSo if we turn on Find My Mac, it will turn\non that guest account at the same time.\n\n529\n00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.504\nOkay, now on my device I have\nactually disabled the guest account.\n\n530\n00:25:09.504 --> 00:25:11.138\nOr I think I did, let's see.\n\n531\n00:25:11.138 --> 00:25:14.301\nI go to my users and\nyeah my guest user is off.\n\n532\n00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:19.247\nBut when you turn Find My Mac on,\nit will turn on your guest account.\n\n533\n00:25:19.247 --> 00:25:23.509\nSo if you ever come in here and notice\nthat your guest account is enabled and\n\n534\n00:25:23.509 --> 00:25:27.280\nyou don't know why,\nit's usually Find my Mac that did it.\n\n535\n00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.933\nAnd you gotta pick and choose that, right?\n\n536\n00:25:28.933 --> 00:25:33.470\nDo I wanna have a guest account or\ndo I want Find My Mac to work?\n\n537\n00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:37.710\nAnd if I turn off the guest account,\nFind My Mac is effectively useless.\n\n538\n00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:41.544\nIf I have the guest account turned on,\nthen Find My Mac will work, right?\n\n539\n00:25:41.544 --> 00:25:44.795\nSo I could always turn mine back on\nhere saying allow guests to login to\n\n540\n00:25:44.795 --> 00:25:45.533\nthe computer.\n\n541\n00:25:45.533 --> 00:25:49.643\nAnd allow guest users to connect to\nshared folders or I could turn that off.\n\n542\n00:25:49.643 --> 00:25:50.507\nIt's up to me.\n\n543\n00:25:50.507 --> 00:25:54.170\nBut if you have the shared folders turned\non, that allows them network access.\n\n544\n00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.772\nAnd so now they can access other\nresources you may or may not want.\n\n545\n00:25:57.772 --> 00:25:59.385\nSo you can turn these things on.\n\n546\n00:25:59.385 --> 00:26:03.536\nOnce they're on, now the guest account\nworks, and we're basically able to reach\n\n547\n00:26:03.536 --> 00:26:06.393\nout and communicate.\n&gt;&gt; Well that being said,\n\n548\n00:26:06.393 --> 00:26:10.360\nis my laptop safe if it gets stolen?\n&gt;&gt; It's close, right?\n\n549\n00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.444\nIt's pretty close.\n\n550\n00:26:11.444 --> 00:26:17.250\nAt this point there is still one more\nattack that a thief or somebody could do.\n\n551\n00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.805\nMaybe they don't care about the hardware,\nright?\n\n552\n00:26:20.805 --> 00:26:25.173\nThey're not trying to just sell this on\neBay, maybe they are after my data, right?\n\n553\n00:26:25.173 --> 00:26:29.590\nThey know that I've got the secret formula\nfor Coca-Cola stored on my hard drive,\n\n554\n00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.557\nif they could just get at it, right?\n\n555\n00:26:31.557 --> 00:26:35.240\nSo they steal my computer and\nthey don't know my password.\n\n556\n00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.140\nThey can't log in as me.\n\n557\n00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.769\nAll right, they try and\nbypass that with a reset.\n\n558\n00:26:38.769 --> 00:26:39.909\nI got a firmware password.\n\n559\n00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:43.736\nSo they can't get into recovery.\n\n560\n00:26:43.736 --> 00:26:44.418\nDrat, right?\n\n561\n00:26:44.418 --> 00:26:46.003\nThey've been foiled.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n562\n00:26:46.003 --> 00:26:48.334\n&gt;&gt; Well, they could crack it open,\n\n563\n00:26:48.334 --> 00:26:50.841\nthey could take the hard drive out.\n\n564\n00:26:50.841 --> 00:26:54.948\nAnd they could stick the hard drive on as\na second hard drive to some computer that\n\n565\n00:26:54.948 --> 00:26:56.184\nthey control, right?\n\n566\n00:26:56.184 --> 00:26:59.932\nA computer that they can log into and\nhave access to.\n\n567\n00:26:59.932 --> 00:27:03.547\nAnd when my hard drive is just\na second hard drive in their system,\n\n568\n00:27:03.547 --> 00:27:07.044\nthey can browse into it and\nread all the data out of it they want.\n\n569\n00:27:07.044 --> 00:27:10.360\nThey now control the drive and\nthey're able to read that data.\n\n570\n00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.279\nSo I'm not completely safe, right?\n\n571\n00:27:12.279 --> 00:27:14.423\nSo there's one more security\nfeature I wanna mention.\n\n572\n00:27:14.423 --> 00:27:18.409\nWe're gonna talk about it more in another\nepisode, but it's called FileVault, right?\n\n573\n00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:21.815\nYou might have noticed that when I\nwas in my system preferences, and\n\n574\n00:27:21.815 --> 00:27:23.382\nI was in security and privacy.\n\n575\n00:27:23.382 --> 00:27:27.027\nAnd in here there's a tab\ncalled FileVault, okay?\n\n576\n00:27:27.027 --> 00:27:31.004\nThis is where we can\nturn on disk encryption,\n\n577\n00:27:31.004 --> 00:27:35.722\nwhere it will encrypt\neverything on your hard drive.\n\n578\n00:27:35.722 --> 00:27:39.829\nNow if somebody cracks open your system,\ntakes out the hard drive, and\n\n579\n00:27:39.829 --> 00:27:43.668\nadds it as a second drive to\nanother machine, it doesn't matter.\n\n580\n00:27:43.668 --> 00:27:47.240\nBecause everything on there is\nencrypted and you are safe.\n\n581\n00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:52.094\nSo the short answer to Zach's\nquestion is no we're not safe yet.\n\n582\n00:27:52.094 --> 00:27:54.908\nBut the slightly longer answer is that,\n\n583\n00:27:54.908 --> 00:27:59.210\nif we have a good user password,\nand a firmware password, and\n\n584\n00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:04.160\nwe're doing FileVault disk encryption,\nyes, we're safe.\n\n585\n00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:09.680\nIf somebody steals my device,\nnot only can they not get at my data,\n\n586\n00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.560\nthey can't even reset\nthe system to resell it.\n\n587\n00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.910\nIt's effectively a dead weight for them.\n\n588\n00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.818\nMaybe they could take the power\nsupply out and sell that for parts.\n\n589\n00:28:17.818 --> 00:28:21.440\nMaybe they could take the monitor off and\nsell that for parts.\n\n590\n00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.440\nBut the system itself is no\nlonger functional for them.\n\n591\n00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.090\nThey won't be able to use it.\n\n592\n00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.365\nSo that really deters theft.\n\n593\n00:28:27.365 --> 00:28:28.574\nIt makes it where-\n&gt;&gt; I would think so.\n\n594\n00:28:28.574 --> 00:28:30.874\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if it's a properly secured\n\n595\n00:28:30.874 --> 00:28:34.615\nsystem, there is no point in\nstealing a Mac these days.\n\n596\n00:28:34.615 --> 00:28:35.855\nNot everybody knows that.\n\n597\n00:28:35.855 --> 00:28:38.883\nSo it's best to secure the system,\nmake sure you turn on encryption.\n\n598\n00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:43.658\nAnd then that way, you know your data is\nsafe, even if your device gets stolen.\n\n599\n00:28:43.658 --> 00:28:45.899\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, another great episode,\n\n600\n00:28:45.899 --> 00:28:47.374\nuser account security.\n\n601\n00:28:47.374 --> 00:28:49.976\nAnd I know there is a few more\nwords you'd like to share with us.\n\n602\n00:28:49.976 --> 00:28:52.477\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wanted to get to a question\n\n603\n00:28:52.477 --> 00:28:56.801\nthat came up in our chatroom\nabout the Keychain and iCloud.\n\n604\n00:28:56.801 --> 00:29:00.679\nYeah, the question was to\ngive everybody context here.\n\n605\n00:29:00.679 --> 00:29:06.570\nBut I talked about how I could use iCloud\nto reset the user account's password.\n\n606\n00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:08.538\nBut what about the Keychain, right?\n\n607\n00:29:08.538 --> 00:29:11.441\nThe Keychain has its own password.\n\n608\n00:29:11.441 --> 00:29:15.796\niCloud won't reset the Keychain's\npassword, so you'd still lose it,\n\n609\n00:29:15.796 --> 00:29:20.022\nexcept there is actually one feature\nin iCloud that I didn't mention.\n\n610\n00:29:20.022 --> 00:29:22.557\nAnd let me see if I even have\nit turned on, I might not.\n\n611\n00:29:22.557 --> 00:29:28.085\nIf I go back into my system\npreferences and iCloud it turned on.\n\n612\n00:29:28.085 --> 00:29:35.122\nIn my list of stuff here, when I synced\niCloud, I did an iCloud Keychain.\n\n613\n00:29:35.122 --> 00:29:40.800\nThis is where your entire Keychain is\nstored encrypted, on the iCloud servers.\n\n614\n00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.120\nNow there's two really cool reasons for\ndoing this.\n\n615\n00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:50.790\nReason one is if I have an iPhone and\nan iPad and a MacBook and an iMac, right?\n\n616\n00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:51.703\nI'm a good Apple customer.\n\n617\n00:29:51.703 --> 00:29:53.449\nI bought all the stuff.\n\n618\n00:29:53.449 --> 00:29:57.351\nI can have a synchronized Keychain\nacross all those devices.\n\n619\n00:29:57.351 --> 00:29:59.635\nSo if I go to a website on my desktop and\nI save the password,\n\n620\n00:29:59.635 --> 00:30:01.842\nwhen I go to my iPhone\nthe password is saved there, too.\n\n621\n00:30:01.842 --> 00:30:02.447\nThat's nice, right?\n\n622\n00:30:02.447 --> 00:30:03.689\nThat's feature one.\n\n623\n00:30:03.689 --> 00:30:09.698\nFeature two though, if I have to reset my\npassword I'm gonna lose my local Keychain,\n\n624\n00:30:09.698 --> 00:30:12.129\nthe local Keychain gets deleted.\n\n625\n00:30:12.129 --> 00:30:15.522\nBut it's just gonna synchronize\nit down again from iCloud and\n\n626\n00:30:15.522 --> 00:30:17.540\nI get the intact Keychain.\n\n627\n00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:23.256\nSo technically ICloud does not\nreset the Keychain's password.\n\n628\n00:30:23.256 --> 00:30:25.149\nBut that's okay, because I don't need it.\n\n629\n00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:27.067\nIt can erase itself, what do I care?\n\n630\n00:30:27.067 --> 00:30:30.644\nBecause I'm gonna repopulate it\nfrom iCloud as soon as it's rebuilt\n\n631\n00:30:30.644 --> 00:30:31.513\nempty, right?\n\n632\n00:30:31.513 --> 00:30:32.825\nSo it fixes itself.\n\n633\n00:30:32.825 --> 00:30:36.110\nSo as long as we have that\nKeychain in place in iCloud,\n\n634\n00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.163\nthen we'll preserve that data.\n\n635\n00:30:38.163 --> 00:30:40.374\nAnd this is the way Apple\nwants to people to do it now.\n\n636\n00:30:40.374 --> 00:30:42.563\nThey want everybody to use iCloud for\n\n637\n00:30:42.563 --> 00:30:45.990\ntheir accounts because of\nprotections like these.\n\n638\n00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.747\nBut there's still tons of schools,\nuniversities,\n\n639\n00:30:48.747 --> 00:30:52.373\nbusinesses that don't want to give\neach employee an iCloud account.\n\n640\n00:30:52.373 --> 00:30:53.667\nAnd so they don't use these features.\n\n641\n00:30:53.667 --> 00:30:56.368\nSo that's why we need to know\nboth ways of handling that data.\n\n642\n00:30:56.368 --> 00:30:58.152\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic information as always, Don.\n\n643\n00:30:58.152 --> 00:31:01.081\nApple certified support\nprofessional is a fabulous series.\n\n644\n00:31:01.081 --> 00:31:02.833\nMake sure you see every episode.\n\n645\n00:31:02.833 --> 00:31:05.536\nDon has done a great job putting this\ninformation all together for you.\n\n646\n00:31:05.536 --> 00:31:07.128\nAnd you're in the course library, so\n\n647\n00:31:07.128 --> 00:31:10.626\nthere's thousands of other

TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.065\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:20.683\nAs we continue on with\nApple Certified Support Professional and\n\n8\n00:00:20.683 --> 00:00:23.500\nthis is file storage,\nthe title of this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.261\nWe're going to talk about file storage,\nright? &gt;&gt; I guess we kind of are obligated\n\n10\n00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:31.125\nnow, it's the name of the show.\n&gt;&gt; We need to.\n\n11\n00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:31.643\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n12\n00:00:31.643 --> 00:00:35.850\nin this episode, we're gonna look at\na lot of the different places that we can\n\n13\n00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.910\nput our files on a Mac and\nthe ways that we can store them.\n\n14\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.826\nThere's a surprising amount of options\navailable to us when we store information,\n\n15\n00:00:43.826 --> 00:00:48.600\nthere are defaults and the defaults\nare good enough for most people.\n\n16\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.552\nBut there are times where\nwe need alternatives and\n\n17\n00:00:50.552 --> 00:00:54.810\noptions and we need to understand what\nthat storage is like in our system.\n\n18\n00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.810\nNow, storage is a constantly\nevolving thing.\n\n19\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.030\nSo, if you're watching this show,\n\n20\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.970\nI've got a Mac that is a,\nit's actually less than a year old but\n\n21\n00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.770\nit's a late 2014 model because they\nhaven't updated the Mac minis.\n\n22\n00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.880\nThe current generation of MacBooks\nhave a slightly different type of\n\n23\n00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.470\nhard drive that's in them, the older Macs\nhad a completely different subsystem of\n\n24\n00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.710\nstorage in them, so\nif you're checking all this on your Mac,\n\n25\n00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.040\nyou may actually see something\ndifferent than what I do.\n\n26\n00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.960\nAnd that's why it's important that\nwe understand all the different\n\n27\n00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.830\nthings that might turn up\nbecause you just never know.\n\n28\n00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.780\nWhen you go from system to system.\n\n29\n00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.350\nSome of them have very fast, high density\ndisks that are present in some of\n\n30\n00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.850\nthe newer systems,\nsome will have more than one drive,\n\n31\n00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.890\nwhich a lot of the new systems don't allow\nbecause there's just not enough room.\n\n32\n00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.670\nThey've made them too small.\n\n33\n00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.000\nSo there's a lot variety,\na lot of variation,\n\n34\n00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.270\nwe need to understand what that variety\nis and what each is really intended for.\n\n35\n00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.680\nSo that's what we're gonna be looking\nat right here in File Storage.\n\n36\n00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.210\n&gt;&gt; And what types of storage are supported\n\n37\n00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.200\nin Mac OS?\n&gt;&gt; We can break\n\n38\n00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.180\ndown storage into two categories,\ninternal and external, right?\n\n39\n00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.370\nOur internal storage, this is stuff\nthat's gonna be built into our Mac.\n\n40\n00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.590\nSo when you go to Apple's website or\ngo to Best Buy or\n\n41\n00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.360\nthe Apple store or wherever and you buy\nyour Mac, it's got some storage inside it.\n\n42\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.930\nIt's a given, it's gonna have at least a\nlittle bit of storage of in there cuz it's\n\n43\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.140\ngotta hold the operating system somewhere,\nright?\n\n44\n00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.860\nThat's internal storage.\n\n45\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.440\nAnd we typically don't change our internal\nstorage, that the storage that it\n\n46\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.790\nhas when we buy the device is the storage\nthat it has when we get rid of the device.\n\n47\n00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.000\nThat it, maintains the same.\n\n48\n00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.890\nNow there's plenty of companies out there\nlike OWC that sell upgrade kits and\n\n49\n00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.460\nall that but Apple doesn't\nofficially do upgrade kits for\n\n50\n00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.980\nany of their devices across the board,\nanymore.\n\n51\n00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.550\nSo, that storage,\nthat internal storage is built in, right?\n\n52\n00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.810\nSo, you'll know what that storage\nis when you buy the device.\n\n53\n00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.620\nAnd it's unchanged\nthroughout the life of it.\n\n54\n00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.270\nThese are things like hard drives.\n\n55\n00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.830\nAnd there's actually three different\ntypes of hard drives in Macs these days.\n\n56\n00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.520\nThere's traditionally spinning disks,\n\n57\n00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.490\nwhich we just call HDDs or\nHard Disk Drives.\n\n58\n00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.570\nThere's solid state digital disks or SSDs.\n\n59\n00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.320\nThose are the fast ones that cost a lot\nmore money but boy, are they fast.\n\n60\n00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.360\nAnd then there's the fusion drives that\nare in between that have spinning and\n\n61\n00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.970\nSSD kind of combined into one.\n\n62\n00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.940\nSo those are of different varieties.\n\n63\n00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.380\nBut those are all internal.\n\n64\n00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.590\nAnd we will typically just use the\nstandard Apple file systems on those and\n\n65\n00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.390\nwe'll put our files there and\nwe're in business.\n\n66\n00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.690\nOn the external side though,\nit becomes the wild west.\n\n67\n00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.915\nIf you have a Mac made in\nthe last three or four years,\n\n68\n00:03:32.915 --> 00:03:38.520\nyou'll likely have USB 3.0 ports,\nyou'll likely have thunderbolt ports,\n\n69\n00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.480\nyou might even have fire\nwire ports on your Mac.\n\n70\n00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.370\nAnd that means you can hook up storage of\nall sorts of varieties to those ports and\n\n71\n00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.190\nthey might be spinning discs or SSDs.\n\n72\n00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.000\nThey might be cheap thumb drives,\nthey might be an Apple super drive, right,\n\n73\n00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.180\nan optical disc.\n\n74\n00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.720\nIt could be any number of crazy\nthings that you can go out there and\n\n75\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.330\nbuy on the external side.\n\n76\n00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.110\nAnd these, these come and go, right?\n\n77\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.550\nThey're called transient storage,\nit's not always there.\n\n78\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.680\nIt might be there one day and\ngone the next.\n\n79\n00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.350\nAnd we add more or\nremove them as we see fit.\n\n80\n00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.810\nHere, things are way different\nthan internal storage, right?\n\n81\n00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.758\nBut that kind of gives you an idea of some\nof the different types of devices that\n\n82\n00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:19.290\nare out there.\n\n83\n00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.870\nThere's a lot of things and\n\n84\n00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.170\nsome of it is Apple branded like\nthe super drive that I mentioned.\n\n85\n00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.350\nBut a lot of it as after market, right?\n\n86\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.330\nThat you go and you get a Western Digital\niDrive or whatever they're called and\n\n87\n00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.020\nyou stick it on and\nnow you got extra storage.\n\n88\n00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.960\nThose are perfectly fine.\n\n89\n00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.060\nApple allows those connections.\n\n90\n00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.410\nYou don't violate your warranty.\n\n91\n00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.920\nIt's external.\n\n92\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.830\nYou're just plugging into a port, right?\n\n93\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.560\nBut that's where we're going to see\nthe most change with those two types\n\n94\n00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.740\nof storage.\n&gt;&gt; How can I find out what storage is\n\n95\n00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.500\npresent in my Mac?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, good question here.\n\n96\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.780\nLike with my Mac, I have a Mac Mini.\n\n97\n00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.790\nIt's tucked under the podium down here.\n\n98\n00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.420\nAnd it's got some internal storage, right?\n\n99\n00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.840\nNow, I bought it.\n\n100\n00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.270\nSo I know how much storage it has.\n\n101\n00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.900\nBut if I didn't.\n\n102\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.260\nIf this is the first time I've used\nthis system, how much storage do I have?\n\n103\n00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.270\nAnd what type of disks do I have?\n\n104\n00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.280\nWell, there's a few\ndifferent ways to see that.\n\n105\n00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.800\nOur external storage is actually gonna\nshow up right here on my desktop, right?\n\n106\n00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.490\nSo I have a USB key plugged in,\nwhich is called DonUSB, so\n\n107\n00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.480\nit's showing up right there.\n\n108\n00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.920\nAnd then I have my Time Machine\nbackup drive plugged in.\n\n109\n00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.470\nThey're both USB devices.\n\n110\n00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.930\nOne's a 16 gig USB key.\n\n111\n00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.850\nThe other's a 1 terrabyte USB 3.0 drive,\nright?\n\n112\n00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.120\nSo, I've got those plugged in.\n\n113\n00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.470\nI can see them but\nmy internal storage doesn't show up.\n\n114\n00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.340\nAnd other things like a superdrive,\n\n115\n00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.960\na superdrive won't show up\nuntil you put a disk in it.\n\n116\n00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.400\nSo I might have\nthe superdrive attached but\n\n117\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.400\nit's empty right now and it won't show up.\n\n118\n00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.860\nIf we want to get a better handle on our\nstorage, you can see some things by going\n\n119\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.040\nup to your apple menu and\ngoing to about this mac.\n\n120\n00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.890\nOn the About This Mac screen,\n\n121\n00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.620\nit's gonna show you some basic\ninformation about your system, right?\n\n122\n00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.880\nAnd it's telling you things like your\nRAM and your start up disk, right?\n\n123\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.570\nSo I get some basic information here.\n\n124\n00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.680\nBut notice,\nit's not really tell me about my storage.\n\n125\n00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.270\nWell, I've got a separate tab for\nStorage up here and\n\n126\n00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.480\nif I go to that Storage tab,\nI can see what I've got.\n\n127\n00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.590\nI've got a Macintosh HD,\nthat's my built in hard drive.\n\n128\n00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.810\nIt's a solid state seta drive.\n\n129\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.790\nI have an SSD, not a fusion drive or\na regular hard drive.\n\n130\n00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.600\nI have an SSD and it's 250 gigs in size.\n\n131\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.450\nI've used a little bit of it but\nthat's the size of it.\n\n132\n00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.100\nWhen you buy it, like when I bought this,\n\n133\n00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.330\nI could have chosen to do a 500 gig but\nit's expensive and I'm a tightwad.\n\n134\n00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.690\nSo I went with the 250.\n\n135\n00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.620\nYou pick when you buy it, right?\n\n136\n00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.610\nI can't change that without having to\ncompletely tear apart my Mac Mini.\n\n137\n00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.870\nThat's the storage that it's got.\n\n138\n00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.360\nHere's my external drive.\n\n139\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.580\nThat one terabyte backup drive that I've\ngot, it actually is a Western Digital.\n\n140\n00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.410\nSo it shows up as USB Disk and\nit's got one terabyte of storage.\n\n141\n00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.440\nAnd there's that USB key right there.\n\n142\n00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.720\nBut the information that I'm seeing\nhere is kind of vague, right?\n\n143\n00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.340\nI mentioned like this one terabyte\ndrive is a Western Digital.\n\n144\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.270\nI know that.\n\n145\n00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.420\nWell, if I could look at it, I can see it.\n\n146\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.460\nBut for you the viewer at home,\nhow do you know I actually have it.\n\n147\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.030\nIt could be anything, right?\n\n148\n00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.160\nThis, like screen right here is\nreally designed just for end users.\n\n149\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.650\nYou get this high level view\nthat's not very detailed, right?\n\n150\n00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.750\nBut if you go back to the Overview tab,\nyou'll see a link in here for\n\n151\n00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.450\nSystem Report.\n\n152\n00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.840\nAnd System Report,\nthat's designed for technicians.\n\n153\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.470\nThis will show you everything you could\never want to know about your system\n\n154\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.730\nin super detail.\n\n155\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.600\nIn fact, way more detail than most\nend users are ever gonna tolerate.\n\n156\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.950\nNotice that it opens up immediately to\nthe hardware section and I can go down and\n\n157\n00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.910\nI can look for\nwhatever type of storage that I want.\n\n158\n00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:42.890\nFireWire, right?\n\n159\n00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.360\nDo I have any FireWire storage?\n\n160\n00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.110\nI click on it, no.\n\n161\n00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.380\nNot only do I not have FireWire storage,\nI don't even have and fire wire ports.\n\n162\n00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.752\nI don't have them, right?\nIf I come down a little further, NVME.\n\n163\n00:07:54.752 --> 00:07:59.516\nNVME discs are, it's a very,\nvery fast type of SSD that's\n\n164\n00:07:59.516 --> 00:08:04.270\nbeing used in some of\nthe current generation MacBooks.\n\n165\n00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.894\nIt wasn't being used in Mac Minis.\n\n166\n00:08:06.894 --> 00:08:08.477\nAs of today it is not\nbeing used in Mac minis.\n\n167\n00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:11.040\nBut that's coming down the line.\n\n168\n00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.050\nWe can see parallel SCSI disks.\n\n169\n00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:14.620\nRight?\n\n170\n00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.120\nSCSI.\n\n171\n00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.110\nThat is an old technology.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n172\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.730\n&gt;&gt; But if you had a Mac\n\n173\n00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.510\nprior to like the Intel switch, they all\nhad SCSI drives in them in the old days.\n\n174\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.070\nBut I can see this computer\ndoesn't contain any.\n\n175\n00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.894\nI can find SAS drive,\nserial attached SCSI.\n\n176\n00:08:29.894 --> 00:08:31.727\nThat's what replaced the old SCSI.\n\n177\n00:08:31.727 --> 00:08:32.990\nI don't have any of those either.\n\n178\n00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.830\nThen when I get to SATA, there we go.\n\n179\n00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.700\nSo I've got an SSD inside of my system.\n\n180\n00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.460\nAnd I can see that information about it.\n\n181\n00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.230\nI can see that it's\nactually made by Samsung.\n\n182\n00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.840\nAnd here it's showing up,\nI can see the speeds on it and so on.\n\n183\n00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.286\nWe'll see if we can find that USB\ndisk of mine, that will be under USB.\n\n184\n00:08:50.286 --> 00:08:55.029\nAnd here I can bind out a USB 3 Bus and\nas I scroll down in here,\n\n185\n00:08:55.029 --> 00:09:00.262\nI can find a DataTraveler SE9,\nthat's my USB key I'm guessing.\n\n186\n00:09:00.262 --> 00:09:05.200\nYeah, its 15.61 gigabytes and if we look,\n\n187\n00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.140\nit's a USB disk formatted MS-DOS FAT32,\nand\n\n188\n00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.090\nit is DON_USB that confirms it,\nthat is my USB key.\n\n189\n00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.300\nBut if I keep scrolling down,\nI should find that other disk in here,\n\n190\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.410\nit's missing its name right here.\n\n191\n00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.180\nIt's a western digital elements disk,\nand I can see it right there,\n\n192\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.910\nWestern Digital Technologies,\nand the speed and\n\n193\n00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:32.550\nother connection information on it, I can\nspot it all right there, and now I have\n\n194\n00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.650\nan idea of what that storage is on my\nsystem, and how my system is attacking it.\n\n195\n00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.390\nSo that's a great way\nto see what you've got.\n\n196\n00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.950\n&gt;&gt; Where does the drive name come from\n\n197\n00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.130\nthough?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n198\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.820\nso these drives have names, right?\n\n199\n00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.940\nAnd some of the names are made up,\nsome are assigned, right?\n\n200\n00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.550\nSo for example, I've got these two disks,\none is called time machine.\n\n201\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.650\nAnd ones called DON_USB, right.\n\n202\n00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.390\nBoth of those tell me exactly what\nthese disks are, I see it and\n\n203\n00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.050\nI know what it ism right?\n\n204\n00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.980\nThose names are actually\njust aliases of the disk.\n\n205\n00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.565\nThe disks have a real name that\nthe operating system gives them, and\n\n206\n00:10:05.565 --> 00:10:10.151\nif I go back to my system information\nscreen here I can see that my time\n\n207\n00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:14.737\nmachine disc, which has been\nmounted to /volume/TimeMachine,\n\n208\n00:10:14.737 --> 00:10:19.419\nwhich is easy to remember,\nthat disk is actually called disk2s2.\n\n209\n00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:20.990\nThat's a strange name, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n210\n00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.824\n&gt;&gt; Disk 2.\n\n211\n00:10:21.824 --> 00:10:23.700\nThis is actually the third\ndisk in my system.\n\n212\n00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.980\nDisk 0 is built into the system.\n\n213\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.560\nDisk 1 is the little USB key.\n\n214\n00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.380\nAnd then disk 2 is this drive.\n\n215\n00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.180\nAnd then s2 means slice 2.\n\n216\n00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.790\nThere's actually partitions on this disk.\n\n217\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:42.140\nThis partition is an HSF+\npartition which is Apple format,\n\n218\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.760\nand it's my time machine drive.\n\n219\n00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.270\nThere is another partition though right\nup here, which is an EFI Boot partition.\n\n220\n00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.400\nTime machine drives are bootable, so\nI can boot off of this thing, and\n\n221\n00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.530\nthose have to be formatted MS-DOS FAT32,\n\n222\n00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.080\nthat's part of the EFI standard that\nit's gotta be formatted that way.\n\n223\n00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.100\nSo there's two different partitions.\n\n224\n00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.299\nThose names are actually being\nassigned to those partitions, right?\n\n225\n00:11:03.299 --> 00:11:07.700\nSo the computer has a name for it, Mac\nOS's name, and then we have this alias.\n\n226\n00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.220\nWhen you format a disk\nyou can assign an alias.\n\n227\n00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.430\nBut you can change the alias\nafterwards as well on some disks,\n\n228\n00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.460\nnot on every disk but on a lot of them.\n\n229\n00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.570\nSo if I don't like that Time Machine name,\n\n230\n00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.618\nsometimes we can pull up\nthe information on it.\n\n231\n00:11:21.618 --> 00:11:24.240\nYou can right-click on the disk and\ndo Get Info, or\n\n232\n00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.710\nyou can do a cmd+I is what I normally do.\n\n233\n00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.750\nAnd when you do that,\nyou'll see the disk right here.\n\n234\n00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.310\nAnd there's that name\nthat's assigned to it.\n\n235\n00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.990\nOn some file systems,\nyou can double-click on that name,\n\n236\n00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.520\nand it'll let you change it right there.\n\n237\n00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.170\nOn others, it won't let you.\n\n238\n00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.760\nSee how it won't let me change this one.\n\n239\n00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.950\nI can add a tag, but\nthat doesn't actually rename the disk.\n\n240\n00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.340\nSo if I want to rename this one, I need\nto go into the disk utility to do it.\n\n241\n00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.040\nAnd in the disk utility, you can\nrename these things pretty easy and\n\n242\n00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.720\nget in there and change that.\n\n243\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.490\nBut in this case,\nI'm kind of fine with the name as it is.\n\n244\n00:11:55.490 --> 00:12:00.369\nBut we need to understand that\nthe disk has multiple names, right?\n\n245\n00:12:00.369 --> 00:12:02.868\nThis alias there was that disk s2, and\n\n246\n00:12:02.868 --> 00:12:07.660\nthen there's the whole part where\nit gets mounted to a partition.\n\n247\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.460\nAnd the only place that we can really\nsee all of this stuff in one place is\n\n248\n00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.850\nthe disk utility.\n\n249\n00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.060\nAnd if we go into the disk utility,\nyou'll see each of your disks.\n\n250\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.850\nAnd it even categorizes them as\ninternal or external, right?\n\n251\n00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:25.310\nSo I see my internal SSD,\nI see that external USB key and\n\n252\n00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.140\nthe Time Machine disk, right?\n\n253\n00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.210\nAnd so I can spot them right here, up\ntop I can do first aid to repair them or\n\n254\n00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.080\npartition them, or\nerase them and change them.\n\n255\n00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.620\nSo we've got various options.\n\n256\n00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.880\nAnd you can always right click on them, or\n\n257\n00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:43.370\nI'm doing a two finger tap on my magic\ntouchpad, and then you can do rename,\n\n258\n00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.610\nand you can change the alias that we're\nseeing, so now I can come here and\n\n259\n00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.080\nI can type in a new name and\nchange that disk if I want to.\n\n260\n00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.480\nRight?\nSo, like, DONUSB.\n\n261\n00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.380\nI don't know why that's all capitals.\n\n262\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.750\nSo, maybe I don't like that.\n\n263\n00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.170\nProbably because it's backwards.\n\n264\n00:12:57.287 --> 00:12:59.470\nIs not very flexible.\n\n265\n00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.748\nI'm gonna make that a little more normal,\nyeah.\n\n266\n00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:02.378\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n267\n00:13:02.378 --> 00:13:03.069\n&gt;&gt; I figure too,\n\n268\n00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:07.010\nif it makes it all capital anyway so,\nbut I at least got the space in there.\n\n269\n00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.500\nThat's a little better.\n\n270\n00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.620\nSo I've got that one, now it's been\nrenamed and it's got the name.\n\n271\n00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.140\nBut it is still remembering\nthe actual name, and\n\n272\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.260\nas we look here you'll see the rest of it.\n\n273\n00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.470\nIt's been mounted to /volume/USB, so\nif I want to browse to the hard drive and\n\n274\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.690\nfind it, I can.\n\n275\n00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.388\nOr here, it's also called disk3s1.\n\n276\n00:13:24.388 --> 00:13:26.200\nI thought it would be just 1.\n\n277\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.470\nAll right, well, it's all about\nthe order you plugged it in.\n\n278\n00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:32.690\nAnd this one's apparently disk3, slice 1,\nit's only got one partition on it, and\n\n279\n00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.180\nso that's the one that's identified.\n\n280\n00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.980\nMy USB key is not bootable, so\nthat's why I don't have an s2 or whatever,\n\n281\n00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.620\nlike I do on Time Machine.\n\n282\n00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.290\nNow in Time Machine,\n\n283\n00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.640\nthat one was bootable, but\nI don't see that here either.\n\n284\n00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.070\nAnd it just shows that its disk 2s2.\n\n285\n00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.020\nWhere's disk 2s1?\n\n286\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.020\nIt's hidden, okay.\n\n287\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.680\nThe Disk Utility will actually\nhide partitions that you're not\n\n288\n00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.970\nsupposed to mess with.\n\n289\n00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.990\nThat boot partition is one you're\nnot supposed to mess with.\n\n290\n00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.520\nThere's actually boot partitions on\nthe Macintosh hard drive as well.\n\n291\n00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.090\nMy main one, and\nthere's the recovery partition.\n\n292\n00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:06.550\nThose are all being hidden from my view,\nI don't see those right now.\n\n293\n00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.860\nAnd there's way to turn on\ndebugging in Disk Utility.\n\n294\n00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.970\nI'm pretty sure they haven't\nremoved it from the menu.\n\n295\n00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.740\nYou used to have a menu item to do it,\nwhere you could tell it, hey,\n\n296\n00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.670\nI wanna see even the hidden stuff.\n\n297\n00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.610\nMust be Show All Devices,\nand see where they pop up.\n\n298\n00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.800\nYes, even that doesn't do it.\n\n299\n00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.070\nBut there's a command line utility you\ncan run that will enable that, and\n\n300\n00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.560\nyou'll start to see those.\n\n301\n00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.100\nIf we want to see that real quick,\nlet's see.\n\n302\n00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.830\nYeah, let me show you that.\n\n303\n00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.820\nI can fire up the terminal.\n\n304\n00:14:34.394 --> 00:14:37.722\nAnd in the terminal,\nwhich I'll make a little bigger here,\n\n305\n00:14:37.722 --> 00:14:42.410\nthe whole disk utility, it's a GUI,\nit's super easy and nice to use, right?\n\n306\n00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:47.860\nWell, there's a command line version\nof the disk utility also, diskutil.\n\n307\n00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.300\nAnd if you're on diskutil list,\nit'll actually show you\n\n308\n00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.250\nall the disks that are on your system,\nincluding the hidden stuff.\n\n309\n00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.120\nThe hidden stuff that\nthe GUI wouldn't show me.\n\n310\n00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.507\nAnd so now when I come in here and\nlook, if I find my Macintosh HD, right?\n\n311\n00:15:03.507 --> 00:15:04.950\nThere it is.\n\n312\n00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.700\nI can see that not only were\nthere hidden partitions,\n\n313\n00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.640\nthere were three of them, right?\n\n314\n00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.340\nI've got this Preboot partition,\nwhich is used by EFI.\n\n315\n00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.320\nI've got this Volume Recovery partition,\nand\n\n316\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.050\nthen I've got another one labeled\nVM that's 2.1 gigs in size, right?\n\n317\n00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:25.170\nThese are my recovery Values and the\nability to be able to boot those off, and\n\n318\n00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:26.870\nthis last one here is virtual memory.\n\n319\n00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.490\nIt's a little bit of a swap disk or\na page file to store.\n\n320\n00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.520\nIf I were to run out of RAM, I could\nstart to leverage some of that as well.\n\n321\n00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.260\nSo those have all been created and\n\n322\n00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.730\nit's just hiding the ones\nthat I don't need to see.\n\n323\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.030\nOn my time machine disk,\nI can see that same thing.\n\n324\n00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.700\nI've got an EFI partition right\nhere It's a boot partition.\n\n325\n00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:50.390\nIt's being hidden so I don't mess with it,\nand it kinda stays right there.\n\n326\n00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:57.270\nSo all that's being tied into the names of\nthese disks where that name comes from and\n\n327\n00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.910\nhow we're able to identify and isolate it.\n&gt;&gt; Don,\n\n328\n00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.294\nhow does macOS keep track of the volumes?\n\n329\n00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:06.000\nAlright, so with all the stuff that's\nhidden, we don't need to see that, right?\n\n330\n00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.182\nBut the things that we need to see\nIt maps them so we can get to them.\n\n331\n00:16:10.182 --> 00:16:15.253\nSo they each have a name and\nthe name over here is /dev,\n\n332\n00:16:15.253 --> 00:16:17.910\nwhich means it's a device.\n\n333\n00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.770\nAnd then /disk followed by a number.\n\n334\n00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.180\nWhich would be the number\ndetected when we booted.\n\n335\n00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.240\nAnd then lastly, if there's a slice,\nthat will be identified after it.\n\n336\n00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.010\nThat's these numbers down here.\n\n337\n00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.400\nSo that's all kind of coming\ntogether to form a name.\n\n338\n00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.760\nAnd it can tell each one apart.\n\n339\n00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.434\nBut it would be very un-Apple-like to\nshow that to the end user 'cause it's not\n\n340\n00:16:36.434 --> 00:16:37.570\nuser-friendly.\n\n341\n00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.420\nIf I wanna save my accounting report,\n\n342\n00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.910\nI don't want to remember, I've gotta\ngo to slash dev slash disk 2-s-4.\n\n343\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.210\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\n344\n00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.100\nSo Apple masks all of that.\n\n345\n00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.110\nMy mounting to locations\non the hard drive.\n\n346\n00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:58.490\nAnd those locations are in\nthe /volumes folder, okay.\n\n347\n00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.950\nHere's where it maps all the volumes,\nall right.\n\n348\n00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.450\nWhen we talk about a disk,\nthere's really three elements.\n\n349\n00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:07.420\nThere's the physical disk itself,\nthe piece of hardware.\n\n350\n00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:12.030\nAnd then inside of that\nhardware there are partitions.\n\n351\n00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.230\nAnd on each partitions there's a volume.\n\n352\n00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:20.750\nThe volume is what we actually use and\nso the volumes show up right here.\n\n353\n00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:26.420\nI can see Don USB, Macintosh HD,\nTime Machine and they're just folders.\n\n354\n00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.570\nAnd the finder will render those\nin its graphical interface so\n\n355\n00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.420\nthat when I browse into the finder and\nI start browsing for\n\n356\n00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.840\ndisks, I can come in and\nI can find time machine.\n\n357\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.720\nIt's right here.\n\n358\n00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.570\nDon USB, it's right here.\n\n359\n00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.220\nThose things are just available.\n\n360\n00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:41.920\nI can get to them.\n\n361\n00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.740\nIt's no big deal and\nnow I'm able to jump in and\n\n362\n00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.890\naccess the resources that I need, right?\n\n363\n00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.360\nThat makes life a lot easier than\ntrying to remember crazy disc names.\n\n364\n00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.640\nBut there are these three different\nlevels that are happening.\n\n365\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.270\nWhen I go and\n\n366\n00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.600\nclick on time machine, I don't realize\nthat I'm actually picking three things.\n\n367\n00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:03.550\nI'm saying go to disc two,\nwhich is a USB drive.\n\n368\n00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.470\nOn disk two, go to slice two,\nwhich is the time machine partition.\n\n369\n00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:13.690\nAnd then on the slice two, there's\na formatted file system, that in my case,\n\n370\n00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.580\nI think it was HSF plus or\nOSX extended journal and\n\n371\n00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.880\nso it's finding that funnel system and\nit's mapping that to this folder.\n\n372\n00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.430\nSo, all of those decisions are made\nwhen I just clicked on this one\n\n373\n00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.370\nlittle link all kind of automatic.\n\n374\n00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:29.310\nWhich is really nice.\n\n375\n00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.840\nIt makes life a lot easier on us.\n\n376\n00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.500\nNow each disk has to be able to\nkeep track of the partitions and\n\n377\n00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.300\nthe things that are on it.\n\n378\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.540\nAnd there are different ways for\nthem to do that.\n\n379\n00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.720\nWhen I run disk util list,\nI pull up my disk.\n\n380\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.180\nIt sort of shows us some of this, right?\n\n381\n00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.260\nOn my first disk,\nI have got this disk zero here.\n\n382\n00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.580\nAnd you know, let me highlight this.\n\n383\n00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.350\nMy numbering was off earlier when I said,\n\n384\n00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.930\nwhen I thought one of my USB\nkeys was going to be disk one.\n\n385\n00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.810\nI forgot a little something\nthat's different in\n\n386\n00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.930\nhigh sierra that changes this.\n\n387\n00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.130\nIn high Sierra,\nwe have what are called synthesized disks.\n\n388\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.530\nSee how it says synthesized right there.\n\n389\n00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.540\nSynthesized in your head\nthat should mean fake.\n\n390\n00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.790\nThat's a fake disk, right?\n\n391\n00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.700\nIt's not a real disk.\n\n392\n00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.200\nI have a real disk and\nit made it into a fake one, right?\n\n393\n00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.110\nWhy did it do that?\n\n394\n00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.890\nWell when you buy your MAC there's\nthree drives you can pick from.\n\n395\n00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:26.790\nYou can do a regular spinning\nhard drive or you can do SSD.\n\n396\n00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.330\nOr you can do fusion.\n\n397\n00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.030\nAnd a fusion disk is both.\n\n398\n00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.810\nThere is a regular hard drive and SSD.\n\n399\n00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.990\nAnd it uses the SSD for\nfrequently accessed things.\n\n400\n00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.870\nAnd everything else is\nput on the regular disk.\n\n401\n00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.770\nBut the end user just\nsees it as one drive.\n\n402\n00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.870\nIt's two physical drives,\nthey see it as one drive.\n\n403\n00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:45.550\nOkay?\n\n404\n00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:50.300\nThe way they do that is by\nmaking a fake disk to represent\n\n405\n00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.830\nthat one drive and\nto hide the two behind it.\n\n406\n00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.590\nNow, in my case, I've only got one drive.\n\n407\n00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.350\nI've only got one physical internal disk.\n\n408\n00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.820\nIt's this SSD right here.\n\n409\n00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:01.630\nI don't have a fusion drive.\n\n410\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:08.000\nBut Apple started representing all\nof the systems as a fusion drive\n\n411\n00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.180\nregardless of whether you\nactually had fusion or not.\n\n412\n00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.840\nRight?\nSo mine is being treated as if I have\n\n413\n00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.720\na fusion disk but\nmy fusion disk is entirely SSD.\n\n414\n00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.810\nOkay?\n\n415\n00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:21.400\nOn one hand that makes life\na little easier because\n\n416\n00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.730\neverybody is represented the same way.\n\n417\n00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.930\nIf I have SSD.\n\n418\n00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:29.850\nIf I have HDD or if I have fusion,\nit's all represented the same way,\n\n419\n00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.630\nas a synthesized disc/dev/disc one.\n\n420\n00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.250\nOn the other hand it makes\nit where we can expand.\n\n421\n00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:40.200\nBecause it's synthesized I can add\nmore storage to it and would grow.\n\n422\n00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.430\nNow on my Mac Mini, that doesn't help.\n\n423\n00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.650\nMy Mac Mini only has one\nSATA connector inside of it.\n\n424\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.210\nOn a MacBook or a MacBook Pro,\nthat doesn't help.\n\n425\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.510\nIt only has one connector.\n\n426\n00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.870\nOn an iMac, one connector.\n\n427\n00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.280\nWhy bother?\n\n428\n00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.260\nThe MacPro.\n\n429\n00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.480\nThe MacPro still has where you can\nhave more than one drive in there.\n\n430\n00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.760\nI could add another\ndrive after the fact and\n\n431\n00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.240\njust expand the drive that I already got.\n\n432\n00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.640\nThat’s a pretty cool feature.\n\n433\n00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.160\nSo it’s planning ahead and apple just said\nlook we’re going to do it the same across\n\n434\n00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.930\nthe board until everybody sees the same\nview and it wasn’t always like this.\n\n435\n00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.380\nIt’s something that changed a little bit.\n\n436\n00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.180\nSo when I look at this.\n\n437\n00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.610\nWhen I look at my synthesize disk,\n/dev/disk1,\n\n438\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.740\nI don’t actually see\nan EFI partition here.\n\n439\n00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:24.640\nRight, because the operating system\nhasn't booted when the system boots\n\n440\n00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.490\nto map the synthesized drive.\n\n441\n00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:33.200\nSo instead I see my real disk right here,\nthis is my real disk.\n\n442\n00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.750\nAnd it's got the EFI boot partition so\nthat we can boot, and\n\n443\n00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:42.660\nthen it's got a APFS container disc,\nall right?\n\n444\n00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.720\nThat's the new Apple file system.\n\n445\n00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.930\nWe're going to talk about\nthat in another episode.\n\n446\n00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.970\nBut it's got the APFS container.\n\n447\n00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:54.600\nAnd that container is 249.8 gigs,\nmy disk is 250 gigs.\n\n448\n00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.850\nSo it's almost the whole disc and\ninside of it,\n\n449\n00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:03.590\nit's creating a fake disk the synthesize\ndisk that has these partitions.\n\n450\n00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:08.370\nIt's got my Macintosh HD, Reboot,\nRecovery and a Virtual Memory.\n\n451\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.330\nIt's got them laid out inside of it.\n\n452\n00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:15.800\nSo I can see that right here and notice\nhow it's got this APFS Container Scheme.\n\n453\n00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:21.840\nThat is basically like a table of contents\nthat says, here's what's stored on\n\n454\n00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.410\nthis disk, here's the partitions that\nI have, here's how this is divided up.\n\n455\n00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.240\nAnd there's different ways to do that.\n\n456\n00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.940\nNotice on my Time Machine disk,\nit says GUID_partition scheme.\n\n457\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.060\nAnd on my USB key,\nit says FDISK_partition scheme.\n\n458\n00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:35.830\nRight?\n\n459\n00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:40.720\nThese are all different ways of tracking\nwhat partitions are on the disk.\n\n460\n00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.550\nNow I want to talk more about how\nthose partition schemes work but\n\n461\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.070\nthey're different for each file system.\n\n462\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.670\nAnd we haven't talked\nabout filed systems yet.\n\n463\n00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:55.660\nIn the rest of the series we probably\nneed to go on to a part two 'cause\n\n464\n00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.910\nI need to cover it here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do it.\n\n465\n00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.990\n&gt;&gt; I need to talk about GPT which\n\n466\n00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:05.970\nare partition tables, when you talk about\nthe old FAT or File Allocation Tables and\n\n467\n00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.425\nwe need to talk about the APFS and\nhow it does its container scheme.\n\n468\n00:23:09.425 --> 00:23:12.840\n'Cause they all pertain to how the system\nis keeping track of the stuff.\n\n469\n00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.240\nAnd once you understand how\nthose systems work together,\n\n470\n00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.950\nthen it's a little easier to see how\nthese discs are being identified.\n\n471\n00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.640\nMost of this stuff is\ninvisible to the end user.\n\n472\n00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.190\nBut if you're an admin, you have to\ndeal with this from time to time.\n\n473\n00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.240\nIf you're trying to make\na bootable USB key and\n\n474\n00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.520\nit's failing, it might be because there's\na EFI petition stuck on there already.\n\n475\n00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.930\nAnd the system is hiding, so\nyou've got to be able to drop down and\n\n476\n00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.720\nuse tools like these to clean that up and\nget it ready.\n\n477\n00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.300\nThese are things that we bump into.\n\n478\n00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.800\nSo having a good understanding is\nreally important, so let's do this.\n\n479\n00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.500\nI've talked about the disks and\nthe hardware in this episode.\n\n480\n00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.170\nLet's split to a part two and in part two,\nI'll switch to kinda software mode.\n\n481\n00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.850\nAnd we'll talk about the file\nsystems we can put on our storage,\n\n482\n00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.230\nnow we can format them.\n\n483\n00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:00.240\nAnd we can see that partitioning process\nand then that'd give me a chance to show\n\n484\n00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.550\noff the partition tables and how they\nwork and how the system is able to kinda\n\n485\n00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.590\ncoordinate those and show them as\njust simple aliases to the end user.\n\n486\n00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.150\nThanks Don.\n\n487\n00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:12.030\nApple Certified Support\nProfessional File Storage Part 1.\n\n488\n00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.400\nThere will be Part 2, so\nyou want to make sure you see that.\n\n489\n00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.480\nDon, anything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; A lot of the stuff we've done in this\n\n490\n00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.810\nseries so far has been really safe.\n\n491\n00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:23.040\nLike if you mess it up,\nthere's a way to fix it.\n\n492\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.950\nBe careful with file systems.\n\n493\n00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.460\nThere are mistakes you could make\nhere where you could mess it up and\n\n494\n00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.170\nnot be able to fix it.\n\n495\n00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.450\nSo whenever I'm adjusting\nfile systems on my computer.\n\n496\n00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:34.360\nI always unplug my Time Machine disk,\n\n497\n00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.970\n'cause I wanna make sure that I don't\nmess with my Time Machine disk.\n\n498\n00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:38.120\nBecause now if I mess something up,\n\n499\n00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.830\nI can just restore from Time Machine.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n500\n00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.100\n&gt;&gt; So make sure you have a good backup\n\n501\n00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.448\nbefore you make any changes\nto the file system.\n\n502\n00:24:44.448 --> 00:24:46.970\nAnd I I know at this point we\nhaven't actually changed anything.\n\n503\n00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.740\nIn part 2, we're gonna start changing\n\n504\n00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:49.280\nthings.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n505\n00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.840\nSo, you can be a good Apple Certified\nsupport professional.\n\n506\n00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.830\nAnd there is a lot of\nepisodes in this series.\n\n507\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:55.900\nMake sure you see them all and\n\n508\n00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.810\nwhen you're in the course library,\nthere's thousands of other videos.\n\n509\n00:24:58.810 --> 00:24:59.530\nThey're there to help you.\n\n510\n00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:00.680\nCheck them out.\n\n511\n00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.696\nTell everybody you know about ITPro.TV.\n\n512\n00:25:02.696 -->

out.\n\n10\n00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.371\nDon, thanks so much.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, glad to be here, and glad to\n\n11\n00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.765\ncontinue talking about file systems.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n12\n00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:32.610\n&gt;&gt; And storage.\n\n13\n00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.400\nIn the last episode, we had a chance\nto talk about the hardware side,\n\n14\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.140\nthe physical disks in our system.\n\n15\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.928\nIn this episode, we're going to take\na look at the software side and\n\n16\n00:00:40.928 --> 00:00:43.530\nhow we apply a little bit\nof logic to our disks.\n\n17\n00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.810\nAnd format them and arrange them to make\nthem available for use in our system.\n\n18\n00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.500\nSo we've got a lot to tackle,\nso let's do it.\n\n19\n00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.090\n&gt;&gt; Well, what is the primary file systems\n\n20\n00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.840\nused in Mac OS?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n21\n00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.460\nthis is turning into a trickier\nquestion than what it\n\n22\n00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.013\nused to be.\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n23\n00:00:59.013 --> 00:01:00.042\nthat's why I was hesitating.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:00.626\n&gt;&gt; I was like, well,\n\n25\n00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:04.521\nhow should I parse this question?\n&gt;&gt; So, for over ten years now, for\n\n26\n00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:12.150\nover a decade, every Apple system,\nMacBooks, iMacs, Mac Mini, whatever.\n\n27\n00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.620\nThey've all formatted their disks\nwith a standard file system, and\n\n28\n00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.016\nthat's the OS 10 Extended File System.\n\n29\n00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:22.190\nYou'll hear people call it different\nthings, some people say OSX File System,\n\n30\n00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.497\nor Extended File System, but\nit's actually called HFS+.\n\n31\n00:01:26.497 --> 00:01:30.930\nAnd HFS+, it's been around a long time,\nit's actually been around over 20 years.\n\n32\n00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.965\nBut Apple didn't use it consistently\neverywhere until a little over\n\n33\n00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:34.598\na decade ago.\n\n34\n00:01:34.598 --> 00:01:37.051\nSo if you've got a Mac right now,\n\n35\n00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:41.620\nand you've been running any\nprevious version of Mac OS on it.\n\n36\n00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.820\nThen you likely have disks\nthat are formatted with\n\n37\n00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.950\nOS 10 Extended Journaled File System,\nright?\n\n38\n00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.010\nSo that one has been there for\n\n39\n00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.080\nquite a while,\nit's considered the standard file system.\n\n40\n00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.963\nIt provides the linking functions,\n\n41\n00:01:52.963 --> 00:01:56.010\nthe permissions that we're\ngoing to learn about later on.\n\n42\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.830\nThe time machine functionality,\nall of that is powered by HFS+.\n\n43\n00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.810\nSo typically we format a disk,\nthat's what we're going to see,\n\n44\n00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.070\nand if I bring up my disk utility here,\nfire this up.\n\n45\n00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.860\nAnd I take a look at my Time Machine disk,\nright?\n\n46\n00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.570\nI mentioned Time Machine,\nTime Machine, it relies on HFS+,\n\n47\n00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.060\nit won't work on other file systems.\n\n48\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.680\nBecause it needs to track\nthe versions of the files.\n\n49\n00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.760\nAnd so here's my Western Digital Elements\ndisc, this USB disk I have attached.\n\n50\n00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.150\nAnd if I look at the time\nmachine partition on it,\n\n51\n00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.090\nI can see that it is\nMac OS Extended Journaled, right?\n\n52\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.810\nIn previous versions, it had a few\ndifferent ways this name would show up,\n\n53\n00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.250\nbut now it shows up as Mac OS Extended.\n\n54\n00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.000\nAnd then mine just happens to be\nJournaled, which is one of the different\n\n55\n00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.588\nforms of Mac OS Extended.\n&gt;&gt; Well, what modes can\n\n56\n00:02:48.588 --> 00:02:51.906\nthe Extended File System operate in?\n&gt;&gt; So Journaled is one of them.\n\n57\n00:02:51.906 --> 00:02:52.591\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question, isn't it?\n\n58\n00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:53.126\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n59\n00:02:53.126 --> 00:02:53.821\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n60\n00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:57.630\n&gt;&gt; So, Journaled is one of them.\n\n61\n00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.240\nSome people, and\nthe reason I say it's a great question is\n\n62\n00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.670\nsome people just assume\nthat's the only mode, right?\n\n63\n00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.280\nThat, hey, it's Mac OS extended, but\n\n64\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.433\nwhat we're really seeing here is\nthat Mac OS extended, that's HFS+.\n\n65\n00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:15.185\nJournaled is just one mode of it, and\nthere's actually a handful of modes.\n\n66\n00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:18.816\nThere's Journaled, there's Case-Sensitive,\nthere's Encrypted,\n\n67\n00:03:18.816 --> 00:03:21.220\nthere are three different\nmodes right there.\n\n68\n00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.880\nWe could even do all three if we wanted.\n\n69\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.950\nLet's take my USB key here, for example.\n\n70\n00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.950\nSo I'm going to take this\nKingston DataTraveler that I've got, and\n\n71\n00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.450\nit's not a very big disk, but\nmaybe I want to erase it.\n\n72\n00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.676\nAnd when I erase it,\nI can choose to format that, right?\n\n73\n00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:39.320\nSo I'm going to call this Don USB, and\n\n74\n00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.150\nI can pick what I want\nthat file system to be.\n\n75\n00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.140\nAnd when I look, it's letting me pick,\nI can do Mac OS Extended Journaled,\n\n76\n00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.910\nor a Mac OS Extended\nCase-Sensitive Journaled.\n\n77\n00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.690\nNow I mentioned Encrypted,\nthat one's not on the list, where's that?\n\n78\n00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.060\nHm, well, on removable media,\n\n79\n00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.220\nI don't see the Encryption option, because\nit uses File Vault for the encryption.\n\n80\n00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.060\nAnd File Vault stores its keys\nin the hardware of this machine.\n\n81\n00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.220\nIf I have a removable disk,\nand I take it somewhere else,\n\n82\n00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.560\nI won't be able to access that data,\nright?\n\n83\n00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.980\nBut if this were an internal disk,\nI would see more options.\n\n84\n00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.540\nAnd I don't think it'll let me\ndo this with an internal disk\n\n85\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.760\nthat's actually in use.\n\n86\n00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.970\nLet's see what it does if I try and\n\n87\n00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.370\nerase my actual drive,\nit at least brings the screen up.\n\n88\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.730\nSo I can look in here and\nI can see a lot more options, right?\n\n89\n00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.096\nAnd now I see Mac OS Extended Journaled,\nMac OS Extended Journaled and Encrypted.\n\n90\n00:04:32.096 --> 00:04:35.717\nCase-Sensitive and Journaled,\nCase-Sensitive, Journaled, and Encrypted,\n\n91\n00:04:35.717 --> 00:04:38.040\nall three,\nI can go crazy with these, right?\n\n92\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.536\nThese are all just different modes\nof the same file system, all right?\n\n93\n00:04:42.536 --> 00:04:47.440\nNow let me talk briefly\nabout case sensitivity,\n\n94\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.806\ncase sensitivity is an interesting thing.\n\n95\n00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:54.700\nIn the Unix world, you always\nhave case sensitive file systems,\n\n96\n00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.550\nthat's the way Unix has been forever.\n\n97\n00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.980\nBut Apple knows that most users\ndon't think in a case sensitive way.\n\n98\n00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.310\nAnd so when they format a system with HFS,\n\n99\n00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.500\nit typically defaults to not\nbeing case sensitive, right?\n\n100\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.678\nNow if you're not familiar\nwith that terminology,\n\n101\n00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:14.710\nI'm going to format this disk real quick,\nso I'll just call it Don USB.\n\n102\n00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.928\nI'll do Mac OS Extended Journaled,\nwhich is the normal one, and\n\n103\n00:05:17.928 --> 00:05:19.755\nI haven't talked about Journaled.\n\n104\n00:05:19.755 --> 00:05:23.465\nJournaled means that whenever we write a\nfile to the file system before overwriting\n\n105\n00:05:23.465 --> 00:05:25.760\na file,\nit doesn't actually overwrite the file.\n\n106\n00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.470\nIt writes somewhere else, and\n\n107\n00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.020\nonly when the write is 100% done, does it\nremove the original version of the file.\n\n108\n00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.570\nIt does that because if you're\nhalfway through writing the data, and\n\n109\n00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.250\nyou lose power.\n\n110\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.700\nIf you were overwriting the real data,\nyou just lost all your data.\n\n111\n00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.890\nBut if I was writing somewhere else,\nand I lose power,\n\n112\n00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.920\nit can go back to the original file,\nand it's much more resilient, right?\n\n113\n00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.890\nSo it can survive power outages or\n\n114\n00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.000\noperating system lock ups\nwithout corrupting your data.\n\n115\n00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.328\nThat's why Apple doesn't even give me\nthe choice of just doing regular old\n\n116\n00:05:56.328 --> 00:05:57.350\nMac OS Extended.\n\n117\n00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.240\nI can't do that,\nI have to do Journaled, and\n\n118\n00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.760\nthen the other options I can pick from.\n\n119\n00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.980\nNow if I just stick with Journaled, that\ndefault one, I'll go ahead and erase it.\n\n120\n00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.550\nThat's going to erase, and\n\n121\n00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.930\nwhen it's done, now,\nit's going to let me put files on this.\n\n122\n00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.643\nAnd it's not going to care about\nwhether there's capital letters or\n\n123\n00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:20.920\nlowercase letters,\nthe case doesn't matter, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.503\nNow we can see that in the GUI,\nbut it's actually really easy\n\n125\n00:06:24.503 --> 00:06:29.360\nto see it through the Terminal, so let me\nfire up my Terminal, and I'll show you.\n\n126\n00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.200\nIf I get into slash Volumes slash Don USB,\nand\n\n127\n00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.790\nI'm going to create a file\ncalled file1.txt, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.016\nSo I just created file1.txt,\nthen I'm going to create File1.txt,\n\n129\n00:06:46.016 --> 00:06:48.390\nand see how I capitalized the F?\n\n130\n00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.260\nIt was all lowercase before,\nnow I capitalize the F, and\n\n131\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.560\nthen I'm going to do\nFILE1.txt in all caps, right?\n\n132\n00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.730\nSo I just created three files, or did I?\n\n133\n00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.050\nWhen I pull up the list,\n\n134\n00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.470\nI only have one file, all three of\nthose names were treated the same.\n\n135\n00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.930\nIt just said, we will treat them\nall as lower case, and there it is.\n\n136\n00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.250\nSo they are all the same,\n\n137\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.490\nthis is a non-case-sensitive file system,\nwhich end users love.\n\n138\n00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.558\nEnd users, that makes life easier for\nthem, right?\n\n139\n00:07:19.558 --> 00:07:23.660\nBut if we're working with a lot of Unix\nsystems, that can create problems.\n\n140\n00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.450\nThey expect it to be case sensitive,\nthose should be three separate files, so\n\n141\n00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.740\nif I were to format\nthat file system again.\n\n142\n00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.090\nSo I'm going to come in\nhere to erase that disk and\n\n143\n00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.180\nthis time choose case-sensitive, right?\n\n144\n00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.910\nWhen I erase it this time,\nit's going to reformat it,\n\n145\n00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.820\nit's going to put the file\nsystem on the disk.\n\n146\n00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:47.130\nAnd now it's going to be case sensitive,\nand if I repeat what I just did,\n\n147\n00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.510\nand I create those three files,\nwhat's going to happen?\n\n148\n00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.129\nWell, they should be treated\nas three separate files.\n\n149\n00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:58.550\nSo I didn't name it.\n\n150\n00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.327\nSo now, my disk is called untitled\nbecause I didn't give it a name.\n\n151\n00:08:02.327 --> 00:08:08.000\nBut I can say I want to touch filed.txt\nand I'll do it with a capital\n\n152\n00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.980\nletter as well, and\nthen I'll do it in all caps like that.\n\n153\n00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:20.020\nAnd now if I take a look,\nit's three different files, right?\n\n154\n00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.330\nCase sensitivity is not something most\nend users will want, but as an admin,\n\n155\n00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.450\nif you're moving files\nbetween unit systems or\n\n156\n00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.250\nLinux systems in Mac OS,\nit's something you'll bump into.\n\n157\n00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.010\nSo, we have that option to be\nable to turn that on, all right?\n\n158\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.690\nSo, that's kind of a run\nthrough of Mac OS extended and\n\n159\n00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.300\nthe different modes that it works in.\n\n160\n00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.305\nI didn't do FileVault.\n\n161\n00:08:38.305 --> 00:08:39.890\nWe're going to see FileVault\nin another episode.\n\n162\n00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.110\nBut that would encrypt the disc and\nit would add the encrypted mode on to it.\n\n163\n00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.860\nBut that's really kind of the de facto\nstandard for file systems across Mac\n\n164\n00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.850\ndevices or Apple devices.\n&gt;&gt; Didn't High Sierra introduce a new file\n\n165\n00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.166\nsystem?\n&gt;&gt; It did and\n\n166\n00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:55.517\nthat's where your original question\nbecomes a little dicey right because-\n\n167\n00:08:55.517 --> 00:08:56.725\n&gt;&gt; Ha.\n\n168\n00:08:56.725 --> 00:08:57.999\n&gt;&gt; Up until today,\n\n169\n00:08:57.999 --> 00:09:02.740\nMac OS extended journal,\nI mean, that's used everywhere.\n\n170\n00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:08.510\nBut last year, Apple released\nthe Apple file system, or APFS.\n\n171\n00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.140\nAnd APFS was designed to really\noptimize modern storage.\n\n172\n00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.660\nIt can recognize massive drives that are\njust petabytes in size, massive drives.\n\n173\n00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:22.000\nAnd it's really optimized for flash and\nsolid state digital storage, right?\n\n174\n00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.120\nNot spinning discs and not fusion drives.\n\n175\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.180\nIt's designed for\nsolid state storage, right?\n\n176\n00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.350\nSo they rolled it out on the iPhone and\n\n177\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.790\niPad first because those all\nhave solid state storage.\n\n178\n00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.670\nOn the MacBook and other devices,\nit wasn't as common yet for\n\n179\n00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.390\neverybody to just have SSDs.\n\n180\n00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.940\nWell, it's become more common and so\nstarting with Mac OS High Sierra,\n\n181\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.270\nit will default to APFS for\ninternal drives.\n\n182\n00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.090\nNot for external, but for internal drives.\n\n183\n00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:57.070\nSo if you install High Sierra on\nyour system, it will likely have\n\n184\n00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.390\nalready converted your drive over\nto the new Apple file system, APFS.\n\n185\n00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.820\nAnd, in fact, you can see mine,\nthat's happened.\n\n186\n00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.760\nWhen I installed High Sierra on this,\nwell,\n\n187\n00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.320\nif you guys watched episode number two,\nyou saw me install it on here.\n\n188\n00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.500\nI formatted my disk and I didn't mention\nit, but if you go back and watch,\n\n189\n00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.700\nI formatted it Mac OS Extended Journal and\nthen we did the install.\n\n190\n00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.470\nAnd now, if I come and\ntake a look at my disk and\n\n191\n00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.570\nI find Macintosh HD, it's an APFS volume.\n\n192\n00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.480\nIt's formatted APFS.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n193\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.100\n&gt;&gt; It switched me over, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.410\nDidn't ask me, it just did it.\n\n195\n00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.940\nBut that's because I have an SSD.\n\n196\n00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.960\nIf I didn't have an SSD, if I had the\nspinning disk cuz when you buy a Mac Mini,\n\n197\n00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.150\nyou can still pick a regular HD,\nregular spinning disk, if you do that,\n\n198\n00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.150\nit'll stay in Mac OS Extended Journal.\n\n199\n00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:51.410\nAnd that's because the APFS, it doesn't\nperform as well on a spinning disk,\n\n200\n00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.670\non the older disks, so you need to\nstay Mac OS Extended Journal on those.\n\n201\n00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.440\nBut if you have an SSD, you can move to\nAPFS and you actually get some performance\n\n202\n00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.090\nimprovements, it can extend\nthe life of your drive.\n\n203\n00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.730\nIt provides some other backup and\nrecovery features and\n\n204\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.240\nsome interesting features there.\n\n205\n00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.844\nProbably the best feature it introduces\nthough is multi-key encryption.\n\n206\n00:11:11.844 --> 00:11:14.650\nWith FileVault, If I encrypt my disk and\n\n207\n00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:19.070\nI have five users on my computer,\nall five users are technically\n\n208\n00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:24.360\nusing the same encryption key to be able\nto decrypt and access the data, right?\n\n209\n00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.910\nSo if I get rid of one user,\nI have to generate a new key.\n\n210\n00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.040\nAnd generating a new key is a problem\ncuz it's got to re-encrypt the disk and\n\n211\n00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.786\nthat can take forever.\n\n212\n00:11:33.786 --> 00:11:38.660\nBut with multi-key encryption,\neach user gets their own key.\n\n213\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.700\nAnd if I get rid of a user account,\nit just gets rid of their key.\n\n214\n00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.960\nAnd the other users have their own key and\nI don't have to re-encrypt the drive.\n\n215\n00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.400\nSo that's a big improvement security-wise,\nas far as eliminating a user.\n\n216\n00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.860\nJust a few other reasons why we\nmight wanna have that, but for\n\n217\n00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.340\nthe exam I do wanna throw\nout one quick caveat.\n\n218\n00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.150\nI said APFS is really designed for\nSSD, not spinning disk.\n\n219\n00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.740\nWhat if I have a fusion disk?\n\n220\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.470\nFusion is both, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n221\n00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, APFS does not\n\n222\n00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.910\nwork on fusion drives at all, right,\nso it won't even let you do APFS.\n\n223\n00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.000\nSo it's just if you have SSD and\nthat's it.\n\n224\n00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.420\nNow, you can have other types of\nstorage connected to your system,\n\n225\n00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.200\nlike my Time Machine drive which\nis still Mac OS Extended Journal.\n\n226\n00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.910\nThat's fine, right, but\n\n227\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:23.740\nwhen I format something the drive that\nmakes up where that partition is stored,\n\n228\n00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.860\nneeds to be an SSD for APSF.\n&gt;&gt; Are there any other supported\n\n229\n00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.390\nfile systems?\n&gt;&gt; Actually a bunch.\n\n230\n00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.410\nIf I take my USB key and\nI format that one.\n\n231\n00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.550\nWhen you go to formatting you\nget to pick from file systems.\n\n232\n00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.730\nThere's a few others that are listed here.\n\n233\n00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.220\nThese are actually here to\nsupport Windows, right?\n\n234\n00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.595\nI've got MS-DOS, which is the file\nallocation table or FAT file system.\n\n235\n00:12:44.595 --> 00:12:46.680\nFAT has some big limitations in it.\n\n236\n00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.200\nIt can only do four gig partitions and\nactually you can cheat it a little bit,\n\n237\n00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.060\nbut it's really designed to do\nfiles no bigger than four gigs,\n\n238\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.570\nwhich we frequently have\nfiles bigger than that now.\n\n239\n00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:58.910\nIt's also not very resilient.\n\n240\n00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.840\nIt's very susceptible to getting\ncorrupted if you remove your disc.\n\n241\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.130\nExFAT fixes the size stuff.\n\n242\n00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.310\nIt can handle really, really large files.\n\n243\n00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:12.880\nBut it's still very weak as far as if I\nyank a disk out while it's being used,\n\n244\n00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.100\nit'll corrupt the data,\nnine times out of ten.\n\n245\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.000\nIt's really just not very stable.\n\n246\n00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.050\nBut these two file systems are really\nuseful if you know you're gonna be moving\n\n247\n00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.290\ndata between a Mac and\na Windows machine, right?\n\n248\n00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.650\nWe can carry that data between\nthem with a common file system and\n\n249\n00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.180\nnot have to worry about\nreading crazy things, right?\n\n250\n00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.150\nNow, there are other file systems\nthat don't even show up on the list.\n\n251\n00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:37.720\nThere are some file systems that\nMac OS can read, but not write.\n\n252\n00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.830\nAnything in this list is\nsomething we can write.\n\n253\n00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:45.920\nBut there's file systems like NTFS, in\nWindows the default file system is NTFS,\n\n254\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.790\nthe new technology file system.\n\n255\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:54.380\nAnd Mac OS can read NTFS drives,\nbut it can't write to them, okay?\n\n256\n00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.420\nSo it doesn't show up in here.\n\n257\n00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.345\nWhy would I format a disk,\na file system I can't write to?\n\n258\n00:13:58.345 --> 00:14:00.790\nI would have an empty disk\nthat I couldn't write to.\n\n259\n00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.760\nSo that's if I'm just bringing media\nover from Windows and I plug it in and\n\n260\n00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.450\nnow I can read it to get at it,\nbut I won't be able to write.\n\n261\n00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.060\nSo there are other file\nsystems in there like that.\n\n262\n00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.690\n&gt;&gt; What about Unix or\n\n263\n00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.925\nBSD file systems?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n264\n00:14:11.925 --> 00:14:13.160\nI used Windows as my example.\n\n265\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.120\nThe Unix world,\nApple doesn't support them as well,\n\n266\n00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.860\nfor whatever reason considering that\nthere's BSD Unix under the hood.\n\n267\n00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.030\nMost Linux systems use EXT two, three or\n\n268\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.830\nfour.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n269\n00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.120\n&gt;&gt; Or they use XFS.\n\n270\n00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.730\nMac OS doesn't support any of those,\nnot a one of them, not from the GUI.\n\n271\n00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.250\nFrom the command line there's\nsome ways you can do it,\n\n272\n00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.990\nbut otherwise it's not supported.\n\n273\n00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:40.040\nIn the original Unix distributions\nthey had a file system called UFS,\n\n274\n00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.540\nthe Unix File System.\n\n275\n00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:46.140\nAnd Mac OS, when OS 10 first came out, and\n\n276\n00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.380\nthey had OS 10 server, you could\nactually format drives UFS and use it.\n\n277\n00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.260\nBut today, it's only there in a read mode.\n\n278\n00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.620\nI can read UFS disks if I plug them in,\nbut I can't format or make them writable.\n\n279\n00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.702\nSo there is some UFS support there.\n\n280\n00:14:59.702 --> 00:15:03.070\nBut the more common Linux file systems,\nthat support isn't there.\n\n281\n00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.120\nAnd then there's third-party\nsoftware they can edit and\n\n282\n00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.490\nthere's other ways that you can\nwork it out from the command line.\n\n283\n00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.550\nBut from the GUI,\n\n284\n00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.490\nthat support is just not there.\n&gt;&gt; Do we need to do any maintenance\n\n285\n00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.410\non our file systems?\n&gt;&gt; It depends on the file systems.\n\n286\n00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.920\nSome of them like APFS\ndo self maintenance.\n\n287\n00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.840\nSo we usually don’t have to do anything,\nright?\n\n288\n00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.700\nThere’s other ones like FAT and FAT32 that\nare kind of crummy and you do have to\n\n289\n00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.268\nperform some maintenance, which you\nnormally let the Windows machines do.\n\n290\n00:15:28.268 --> 00:15:31.944\nOn the Mac side,\nlet me give you a scenario, all right?\n\n291\n00:15:31.944 --> 00:15:37.596\nLet's say that I've got a USB key that\nI have to send to a Windows machine,\n\n292\n00:15:37.596 --> 00:15:39.705\nso it's formatted exFAT.\n\n293\n00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:43.646\nAnd I'm writing some data to it and\nmy computer reboots for updates, or\n\n294\n00:15:43.646 --> 00:15:47.781\nI unplug it too soon and I get a message\nthat pops up on the screen saying ooh,\n\n295\n00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:50.650\nyou really should have and fix that right?\n\n296\n00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.336\nYou should have properly\nejected the drive first, right?\n\n297\n00:15:54.336 --> 00:15:56.293\nAll right,\nwhen I say properly ejected the drivers,\n\n298\n00:15:56.293 --> 00:15:57.520\nany number of ways we can do that.\n\n299\n00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.193\nLet me go over here and show you.\n\n300\n00:15:59.193 --> 00:16:02.113\nSo if I'm done with my USB\nkey I should take it and\n\n301\n00:16:02.113 --> 00:16:04.752\ndrag it and\ndrop it on th trash, all right?\n\n302\n00:16:04.752 --> 00:16:06.850\nthat's how you eject.\n\n303\n00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.141\nMost of you already know\nthat at this point.\n\n304\n00:16:09.141 --> 00:16:11.790\nOr ignoring the Finder, and\nI can find the disc and\n\n305\n00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.520\nI can just click the eject\nbutton beside it, right?\n\n306\n00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.970\nOr I think there's actually another\noption up here under the Finder menu if I\n\n307\n00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.240\nremember it, somewhere up here there's\nanother eject option tucked away\n\n308\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.430\nsomewhere in here, I never use this one.\n\n309\n00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.620\nIt is up in the Menu though\nyou can tell it to eject.\n\n310\n00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.470\nBut there's several different\nways to go by ejecting.\n\n311\n00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.040\nBut when you go to eject a disk,\n\n312\n00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.560\nif there's some software that's still\nusing the disk, it won't let you eject it.\n\n313\n00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.760\nIt will tell you disk is still in use.\n\n314\n00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.090\nOkay, and what happens then?\n\n315\n00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.030\nRight?\nLike this USB key here that I'm using,\n\n316\n00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:55.530\nif I were to get in my\nterminal in the desk, right.\n\n317\n00:16:55.530 --> 00:17:01.730\nSo if I create a file, and\nmaybe I start editing that file,\n\n318\n00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.190\nright, so I'm editing it and\nthis is the file.\n\n319\n00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.650\nSo I'm kind of working in that file,\nright.\n\n320\n00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:12.200\nWell, if I go to eject that disk while\nit's in use, what's going to happen?\n\n321\n00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.530\nWell, it depends.\n\n322\n00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:16.850\nIf somebody else is using the disk\nit's not going to let me eject it.\n\n323\n00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:20.920\nIf I'm using the disk,\nit'll try and close my software.\n\n324\n00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.980\nAnd if it can, then it'll eject.\n\n325\n00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.530\nBut in my case,\nit's just saying nope, can't eject.\n\n326\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:26.510\nTerminal is using it.\n\n327\n00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.620\nRight?\nSo I need to go quit and\n\n328\n00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.450\nclose the terminal, and\nthen i can eject it.\n\n329\n00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.720\nThat said,\nyou can force eject it if you want, right?\n\n330\n00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.940\nIf I keep trying to eject it,\neventually it's going to say,\n\n331\n00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.400\nwould you like to force eject.\n\n332\n00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.410\nAnd you can do that.\n\n333\n00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:45.350\nYou can eject it and pop it out even\nthough the software was in use.\n\n334\n00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.780\nNow that's normally gonna\nlead to file corruption.\n\n335\n00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.340\nAnd when you have file corruption,\n\n336\n00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.780\nyou might not be able to\nread from that disk again.\n\n337\n00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.875\nBu,t if that happens,\nthere is a little maintenance we can do,\n\n338\n00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:54.875\nwe can go into the disk utility.\n\n339\n00:17:54.875 --> 00:17:58.805\nAnd in the disk utility you can\npick the corrupt disk, right?\n\n340\n00:17:58.805 --> 00:18:02.565\nAnd you wanna make sure in here,\nwe see the physical disk, and\n\n341\n00:18:02.565 --> 00:18:05.355\nthe we see the volumes inside of it,\nright?\n\n342\n00:18:05.355 --> 00:18:08.265\nYou wanna make sure you pick\nthe physical disk if you can.\n\n343\n00:18:08.265 --> 00:18:12.880\nAnd when you choose the physical disk,\nyou can hit the first aid button up top.\n\n344\n00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.130\nAnd first aid.\n\n345\n00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:20.670\nWe'll run a quick scan of that disk,\nsorry, I just made my window gigantic.\n\n346\n00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.720\nIt'll run a scan over that disk, and\nit'll fix any problems that it finds.\n\n347\n00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.260\nAnd so, if there's corrupted data,\nit can't magically recreate our data.\n\n348\n00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.760\nBut it can block it off so we can get\ntot he other data that's still good.\n\n349\n00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.940\nAnd it will run through.\n\n350\n00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.490\nIt actually does two passes,\na verification pass where it looks for\n\n351\n00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:40.810\nerrors and then it just repair parts where\nit tries to fix the errors if it can.\n\n352\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.620\nOn a good disk it runs really fast.\n\n353\n00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.858\nOn a disk that has\ncorruption this could 5 or\n\n354\n00:18:44.858 --> 00:18:48.750\n10 minutes, it could take hours if it's\na massive disk with a lot of damage.\n\n355\n00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.730\nBut it'll scan through and\ntry to repair it.\n\n356\n00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.713\nThat's about the only maintenance that\nwe really need to do on these disks\n\n357\n00:18:53.713 --> 00:18:54.242\nthese days,\n\n358\n00:18:54.242 --> 00:18:56.577\nbecause a lot of them do self-maintenance.\n&gt;&gt; Well Don,\n\n359\n00:18:56.577 --> 00:18:58.550\nwhat if I can't even boot up the computer?\n\n360\n00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.370\nWhat if can't do anything?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a really good point.\n\n361\n00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:03.780\nAll this time I'm saying,\nyeah you can fix stuff,\n\n362\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.140\njust go into disk utility, but\nif you push the power button.\n\n363\n00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.130\nAnd it boots up, and\n\n364\n00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.520\nyou get the little picture of\na Mac with a question mark on it.\n\n365\n00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.090\nIt can't even find, or it can't boot,\nyour hard drive, right?\n\n366\n00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.960\nYou're having a boot\nfailure at that point, or\n\n367\n00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.520\nmaybe worse, you get the little\nMac with a question mark on it.\n\n368\n00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.150\nThat means it can't find\nthe operating system.\n\n369\n00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:24.235\nWhere's your OS, right,\n\n370\n00:19:24.235 --> 00:19:26.550\nthat's [LAUGH] not good stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Not good.\n\n371\n00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.400\n&gt;&gt; So if we're in that type of siutation,\n\n372\n00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.590\nyou've got a real problem, right?\n\n373\n00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:34.810\nIdeally, You'd restore\na Time Machine backup, right?\n\n374\n00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:35.770\nThat would work, right?\n\n375\n00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.410\nBut let's just pretend for\na moment that we don't wanna do that.\n\n376\n00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.730\nMaybe I know I've worked on some\nreally important documents.\n\n377\n00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:42.810\nI just did them.\n\n378\n00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.800\nAnd hey, I run Time Machine religiously.\n\n379\n00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.060\nBut I just made these changes.\n\n380\n00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.710\nI'd love to get them back if I could,\nright?\n\n381\n00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.310\nIt's possible that your\ndata is still safe.\n\n382\n00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.670\nIt's just it can't boot for some reason,\n\n383\n00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:57.870\nthat your system is now damaged\nenough where you can't even boot.\n\n384\n00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:02.880\nSo in that scenario, there's actually\na really neat hidden feature found in\n\n385\n00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:09.710\nevery Mac called Target Mode.\n&gt;&gt; And target mode is where we can boot\n\n386\n00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:13.100\nup our Mac into this special magical mode.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n387\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.850\n&gt;&gt; It turns this really expensive Mac that\n\n388\n00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:20.370\nyou have into a simple\nexternal hard drive.4 And\n\n389\n00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:26.260\nyou can plug your Mac into another Mac,\nand it'll just see it as a hard drive.\n\n390\n00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.490\nAnd so, on your second Mac, the one's\nthat's good, that can still boot,\n\n391\n00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.880\nyou can run the Disk Utility, and you can\ndo the maintenance, and you can fix it.\n\n392\n00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.240\nIt requires that you have two Macs, right?\n\n393\n00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.910\nThe damaged one, and the good one.\n\n394\n00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.760\nBut like Zack's got his\nlaptop right there.\n\n395\n00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.030\nSo I could take my Mac\nmini boot it target mode,\n\n396\n00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:47.990\nplug it in in his Mac and\nhe'll see it as an external hard drive.\n\n397\n00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.740\nAnd so he doesn't have to boot off of it.\n\n398\n00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.120\nBut you'll see the disk.\n\n399\n00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.180\nAnd then we can run a repair and\nwe can fix it up and\n\n400\n00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.380\nwe can get that squared away.\n\n401\n00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.320\nSo it's a pretty neat feature to have.\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\n\n402\n00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.360\nhow do we use target mode?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n403\n00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.540\nso there are a few steps\nwe need to go through.\n\n404\n00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.527\nFirst I'm gonna need a cable to\n\n405\n00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:04.790\nconnect the 2 Macs together.\n\n406\n00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:05.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n407\n00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.060\nApple only supports 2 types of cables.\n\n408\n00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.260\nFireWire and Thunderbolt, right?\n\n409\n00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.010\nNow, if it's Thunderbolt,\n\n410\n00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:19.090\nI might have the older style Thunderbolt\nconnector on my Mac mini and\n\n411\n00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.880\non Zach's, what is that, a Macbook Air?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n412\n00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.080\n&gt;&gt; On his Macbook Air, right?\n\n413\n00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.600\nAnd so\nI might be able to connect that way.\n\n414\n00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:29.870\nOr maybe, I've got USB-C on mine and\nhe's got USB-C on his but\n\n415\n00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.820\nthey're Thunderbolt enabled ports so\nwe can go that route.\n\n416\n00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.590\nOr maybe I've got FireWire on mine and\nFireWire on his.\n\n417\n00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.380\nPoint is, it's got to match.\n\n418\n00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.340\nI can't have Thunderbolt on mine and\nFireWire on his.\n\n419\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.760\nIt has to match, right?\n\n420\n00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.220\nAnd I have to have a cable, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n421\n00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.580\n&gt;&gt; Apple doesn't just give us one.\n\n422\n00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.010\nBut we usually have cables like that\nlaying around somewhere for a device, but\n\n423\n00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.020\nyou can usually get one, right?\n\n424\n00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.170\nSo first, I need to get a cable,\nall right?\n\n425\n00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:57.680\nSecond I need to power off my Mac,\nthe damaged Mac.\n\n426\n00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.870\nNow the damaged Mac won't boot anyway,\nand so it should already be off.\n\n427\n00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:06.280\nBut in my case, mine's on, so let me get\nin here and I'm gonna shut my Mac down.\n\n428\n00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:11.690\nClose the million windows that I've\ngot open, and get out of all that.\n\n429\n00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:15.010\nAnd then I'm just gonna shut down and\nturn it off, okay?\n\n430\n00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:20.070\nNow, when it's off, I'm gonna take that\ncable, I'll plug it into my Mac, and\n\n431\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:21.690\nI'll plug it into Zach's Mac.\n\n432\n00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.200\nRight?\n\n433\n00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.550\nWe've got to plug the cable\nin while the Mac is off.\n\n434\n00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.930\nIf you plug it in while the Mac is on,\nit gets a little weird.\n\n435\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.020\nSo, while it's off.\n&gt;&gt; Do they both have to be off, Don?\n\n436\n00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.510\nNope, yours can be on.\n\n437\n00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:33.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But the-\n\n438\n00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:33.690\n&gt;&gt; Yours is gonna be off.\n\n439\n00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:34.520\n&gt;&gt; The damaged one has\n\n440\n00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.720\nto be off.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, got it.\n\n441\n00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.120\n&gt;&gt; So I turn it off,\n\n442\n00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.190\nplug in the cable, and\nthen I'm gonna power on the damaged Mac.\n\n443\n00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:47.490\nAnd when I power it on I'm gonna hold\ndown the letter T on the keyboard, okay?\n\n444\n00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.390\nAnd there we go.\n\n445\n00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:53.680\nWe'll know we've booted in target\nmode when we see this icon,\n\n446\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.320\nwell, not necessarily this icon,\nthis is the thunderbolt icon.\n\n447\n00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:56.920\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n448\n00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.100\nthis is the thunderbolt icon.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n449\n00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.580\nwe ran the Thunderbolt cable\nbetween our 2 devices here, so\n\n450\n00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.920\nthat's how its showing up.\n\n451\n00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.705\nIf I did firewire,\nit would actually be the firewire icon.\n\n452\n00:23:04.705 --> 00:23:08.207\n[CROSSTALK] And it moves around like this,\ncuz it's kind of a screen saver,\n\n453\n00:23:08.207 --> 00:23:09.497\nit doesn't wanna burn in.\n\n454\n00:23:09.497 --> 00:23:15.000\nBut at this point, on Zack's computer,\nhe sees me as an external harddrive.\n\n455\n00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.880\nWow, you know I just plugged\nin an external hard drive.\n\n456\n00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.850\n&gt;&gt; And now he can run disk utility,\n\n457\n00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.810\nhe can run a repair on my disk and\nfix the problems and get it going and\n\n458\n00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:23.740\nworking again.\n\n459\n00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.180\nSo if you have more than one Mac, this is\na great way to fix a Mac that won't boot.\n\n460\n00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:31.210\nIf you don't have more than one Mac\nthis isn't so much an option for you.\n\n461\n00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.030\nOr, hey maybe you have more than one Mac,\nand you just don't have a Firewire-\n\n462\n00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.230\n&gt;&gt; Or a good friend maybe.\n\n463\n00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:38.660\n&gt;&gt; If you don't have that kind of resource\n\n464\n00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.800\nThen you're left with boot to recovery,\nreinstall Mac OS.\n\n465\n00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.260\nRight?\nAnd when you do that,\n\n466\n00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.410\nyou reinstall Mac OS,\nit's non-destructive by default, so\n\n467\n00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:51.035\nyour data will stay there and\nit will repair the operating system.\n\n468\n00:23:51.035 --> 00:23:52.585\nBut your data might still be corrupt.\n\n469\n00:23:52.585 --> 00:23:56.285\nSo you'll still want to get\nwhere you can reboot the OS and\n\n470\n00:23:56.285 --> 00:23:58.905\nrun that disk repair to be\nable to fix your problem.\n\n471\n00:23:58.905 --> 00:24:01.465\nSo it's neat to have that kind\nof functionality built in.\n\n472\n00:24:01.465 --> 00:24:03.555\nThat's built in to every Mac.\n\n473\n00:24:03.555 --> 00:24:07.710\nLaptop, desktop, they all have\nthat target mode functionality.\n\n474\n00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.680\nIt does vary based on what\nconnectors you have, though.\n\n475\n00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.650\nSome Macs are starting to have fewer and\nfewer connectors.\n\n476\n00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.110\nI'm waiting for the MacBook air to\ncome out with only a power connector,\n\n477\n00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.100\nand that's it.\n\n478\n00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.470\nWho knows if we'll get to that point,\nbut for right now,\n\n479\n00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.850\nthis works on everything.\n&gt;&gt; Another awesome episode.\n\n480\n00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:25.780\nFile storage part two.\n\n481\n00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.090\nMake sure you see part one.\n\n482\n00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:31.950\nAnd Don, what else would you like to say?\n&gt;&gt; That's about it for the file systems.\n\n483\n00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:35.750\nThere's a lot of other different things\nthat can pop up when we're working with\n\n484\n00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.950\nfiles and storage on a Mac.\n\n485\n00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.890\nSo we certainly haven't\ntouched on all of it.\n\n486\n00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.090\nBut as far as what your end users\nare normally gonna see I think that was\n\n487\n00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:44.660\na pretty good run through.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic,\n\n488\n00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.670\nwell, this is Apple Certified\nSupport Professional series.\n\n489\n00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.300\nMake sure you watch every single episode\ncuz Don's doing a great job for you.\n\n490\n00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.750\nLots of great information\nyou can use all the time and\n\n491\n00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.270\nyou're in the course library aren't you?\n\n492\n00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:55.870\nYes you are.\n\n493\n00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.740\nThere's thousand of videos there that\nare designed to help you go further so\n\n494\n00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.710\ncheck those out.\n\n495\n00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.170\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about ITPRO.TV.\n\n496\n00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.490\nGood IT pro is always

You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello again,\n\n6\n00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.850\nthank you for choosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.538\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:22.018\nFor this episode of Apple Certified\nSupport Professional we are gonna be\n\n9\n00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:24.230\nlooking at securing data today.\n\n10\n00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.960\nSecuring data.\n\n11\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.030\nAnd who is gonna show us but Don Pezet.\n\n12\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.430\nDon, good to have you here, sir.\n&gt;&gt; And glad to be here, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.120\nAnd you know, I've changed my mind.\n\n14\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.891\nI think we're gonna secure data\ntoday instead of data today.\n\n15\n00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:36.056\n&gt;&gt; Let's secure data, yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:36.712\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:36.712 --> 00:00:37.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.633\n&gt;&gt; So either way,\n\n19\n00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:41.250\nregardless of whether you have data or\nif you have data,\n\n20\n00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.956\nit's important to protect it.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n21\n00:00:42.956 --> 00:00:44.820\n&gt;&gt; We wanna make sure that only the people\n\n22\n00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.152\nwe want to get access to our information\nare able to get access to it-\n\n23\n00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:48.672\n&gt;&gt; True story.\n\n24\n00:00:48.672 --> 00:00:50.469\n&gt;&gt; And built into Mac OS there's a number\n\n25\n00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.020\nof ways to ensure that.\n\n26\n00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.960\nIn this episode we're gonna be learning\na little bit about FileVault and\n\n27\n00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.720\na few of the other technologies that are\nbaked away behind the scenes that let us\n\n28\n00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.150\nsecurely store our information in\na way that only we get access to it.\n\n29\n00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.120\nEven if somebody were to\ncompletely steal our computer,\n\n30\n00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.130\nwe know our data would be safe,\n\n31\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.750\nand that's a really important thing if we\nremember to configure it and turn it on.\n\n32\n00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.680\nSo that's what we're gonna see\nright there in this episode.\n\n33\n00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.290\n&gt;&gt; So here's my rhetorical question,\n\n34\n00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.300\nwhy do we need to secure our data?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n35\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.320\nif you think about the default\nprotections that are on a computer,\n\n36\n00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.790\nthey may seem like enough at first glance,\nright.\n\n37\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.388\nFirst off, if somebody wants\nto access my information,\n\n38\n00:01:26.388 --> 00:01:28.910\nyou're gonna log into the computer, right.\n\n39\n00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.290\nI've got a password,\nthey can't log in, that's enough.\n\n40\n00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.460\nHaving a password is enough, isn't it?\n\n41\n00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.870\nNot really, right.\n\n42\n00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.012\nIf I have a password somebody\ncould boot to recovery, and\n\n43\n00:01:39.012 --> 00:01:42.160\nrecovery will let them\naccess the hard drive.\n\n44\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.535\nSomebody can boot target mode and\nhook my laptop up to their computer and\n\n45\n00:01:45.535 --> 00:01:48.700\nnow they can navigate and\nbrowse and access all of my files.\n\n46\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.750\nSo a user account password isn't enough,\n\n47\n00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.410\nit doesn't stop somebody\nfrom getting at the data.\n\n48\n00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.260\nWhat if we go a step further?\n\n49\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.530\nWhat if we do a firmware password?\n\n50\n00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.210\nA firmware password will stop\nthem from booting to recovery and\n\n51\n00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.092\nwill stop them from\nbooting to target mode.\n\n52\n00:02:02.092 --> 00:02:04.500\nSo that's enough, right?\n\n53\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.190\nWell they can rip the hard\ndrive out of my computer and\n\n54\n00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.128\nstick it onto another computer\nthat doesn't have a firmware\n\n55\n00:02:10.128 --> 00:02:11.200\npassword.\n&gt;&gt; Dear.\n\n56\n00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.790\n&gt;&gt; And now they can\n\n57\n00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.720\naccess the information.\n\n58\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.000\nNeither those methods work,\nthey both have limitations, right.\n\n59\n00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.420\nI shouldn't say they don't work,\nthey do work for what their trying to do,\n\n60\n00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.460\nit's just not a total solution,\nright, they've got limitations.\n\n61\n00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.894\nSo we need to be able to\ncreate a total solution,\n\n62\n00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:31.920\nsomething that will protect our data even\nif somebody rips the hard drive out and\n\n63\n00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.680\nsticks it in their own computer, we still\nwant to know that our data is safe.\n\n64\n00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.990\nAnd that's where we need\nadditional protection with things\n\n65\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.760\nlike disk encryption.\n&gt;&gt; So what are our options if we want to\n\n66\n00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.460\nencrypt data in MacOS?\n&gt;&gt; Well\n\n67\n00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.030\nthere's actually a few\ndifferent options but\n\n68\n00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.280\nmost of them are wrapped under the\nmarketing umbrella of FileVault, right.\n\n69\n00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.730\nFileVault is Apple's user friendly\nterm for disk based encryption.\n\n70\n00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.790\nWhen people hear about encryption,\nthey think, man that's complex,\n\n71\n00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.070\nthat's gonna make my life difficult,\nor it's gonna slow my computer down.\n\n72\n00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.110\nSo Apple took the approach of,\nhey, let's just try and\n\n73\n00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.510\nmake this as easy as possible.\n\n74\n00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.500\nWe're gonna create FileVault and FileVault\ncan encrypt the data, make it secure, and\n\n75\n00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.060\nensure that even if somebody\nsteals your computer\n\n76\n00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.720\nthey're not going to be able to get at it.\n\n77\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.580\nNow in the background it's doing military\ngrade encryption, storing the data as\n\n78\n00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.750\nencrypted ciphertext, using private keys\nthat are also stored in encrypted form,\n\n79\n00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.140\nmanaging the key unlocks and\naccessing the data.\n\n80\n00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.830\nAll this really complex stuff,\ncomplex stuff that\n\n81\n00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.730\nnine of ten users have no idea what it is,\nbetter yet know how to do it.\n\n82\n00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.210\nAnd to us it really ends up being like\na couple of button clicks to turn it on,\n\n83\n00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.230\nand now we're protected.\n\n84\n00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.490\nSo it's a no brainer.\n\n85\n00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.430\nFileVault is really what we're gonna want.\n\n86\n00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.360\nThere are other options, though.\n\n87\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.880\nSo for example,\nFileVault has two different modes.\n\n88\n00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.690\nThere's FileVault version one, or\nwhat's called Legacy FileVault now, and\n\n89\n00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.410\nFileVault version two.\n\n90\n00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.140\nFileVault vision one would just encrypt\nyour home directory, your user profile.\n\n91\n00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.605\nFileVault vision two encrypts the entire\ndisk, that's the better option so\n\n92\n00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:06.110\nthat's what most of us are gonna use.\n\n93\n00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.936\nBut what if I ever removed the media,\nlike a USB key or a thumb drive,\n\n94\n00:04:09.936 --> 00:04:14.190\na USB hand drive, time machine backups for\nthat matter, right.\n\n95\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.220\nThose are removable,\nthey're not always here.\n\n96\n00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.910\nSo for those,\nwe can use the MacOS extended,\n\n97\n00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.450\nencrypted file system, or\nthe APFS encrypted filesystem.\n\n98\n00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.950\nAnd they can be encrypted with their own\nprivate key and they're protected as well.\n\n99\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.960\nNow FileVault is technically using APFS or\nMacOS extended's encrypted filesystem,\n\n100\n00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.610\nthey're just doing it in a way that's\nmade it a little user-friendly.\n\n101\n00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.120\nWhen it comes to encrypting removable\nmedia using the actual file system,\n\n102\n00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.130\nit's a little less user friendly.\n\n103\n00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.320\nBut it is important to do to\nmake sure we protect that.\n\n104\n00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.016\nSo kinda three different options here.\n&gt;&gt; So Don, are both versions of FileVault\n\n105\n00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:52.200\nstill available?\n&gt;&gt; Sort of, not really.\n\n106\n00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.720\nSo technically if you install MacOS High\nSierra, right, which is what we've done.\n\n107\n00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.980\nIn our earlier episodes we\ninstalled MacOS High Sierra.\n\n108\n00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.040\nSo here's my nice clean install, right.\n\n109\n00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.860\nIf I go into my System Preferences and\nI go into Security and\n\n110\n00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.800\nPrivacy, inside of here I get FileVault,\nright.\n\n111\n00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.020\nAnd I can see FileVault's\nnot turned on for me,\n\n112\n00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.580\nif I unlock this little panel I'll\nhave the ability to turn it on.\n\n113\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.120\nNow it doesn't say FileVault version\none or FileVault version two,\n\n114\n00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.140\nI don't see that, right.\n\n115\n00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.599\nIn MacOS High Sierra you\nonly have support for\n\n116\n00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.924\nFileVault version two and that's it.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n117\n00:05:31.924 --> 00:05:33.483\n&gt;&gt; Just version two.\n\n118\n00:05:33.483 --> 00:05:40.939\nIn MacOS 10.6 and 10.7,\nyou only had FileVault version one, right.\n\n119\n00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.985\nBut 10.8, all the way through 10.12,\n\n120\n00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:48.750\nthey actually had both, FileVault\nversion One and FileValut version two.\n\n121\n00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.390\nNow as soon as FileVault\nversion two came out,\n\n122\n00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.250\nApple stopped letting you turn\non FileVault version one.\n\n123\n00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.340\nYou could turn on version two, but\n\n124\n00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.220\nif you already had version one turned on,\nit would still support it.\n\n125\n00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.380\nAll the way up to Sierra,\n\n126\n00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.440\nHigh Sierra's the first one to\nstop supporting version one.\n\n127\n00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.511\nSo if you're on a system that's running\nHigh Sierra, you just have version two.\n\n128\n00:06:09.511 --> 00:06:12.261\nBut let me show you another\nsystem I've got parked here.\n\n129\n00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:16.991\nAll right, this system is running\nMacOS 10.12 Sierra, right, or\n\n130\n00:06:16.991 --> 00:06:18.471\nat least I think it is.\n\n131\n00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:21.110\nLet's verify that so\nI'm not lying to you guys.\n\n132\n00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.190\nYeah, Sierra MacOS 10.12.6, so this is\nthe last version before High Sierra.\n\n133\n00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:32.400\nThis machine, while it's running 10.12,\nI actually started it with 10.7.\n\n134\n00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.250\nAnd then upgraded it to 10.8, and\nthen upgraded it to 10.10, and\n\n135\n00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.400\nthen upgraded it again to 10.12.\n\n136\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.030\nThis is my upgrade virtual machine,\nI always test upgrades so\n\n137\n00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.430\nI can learn what's new and so on, so\nthis is one that's been upgraded.\n\n138\n00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.626\nBecause it's been upgraded,\nway back when I had this thing on 10.7,\n\n139\n00:06:49.626 --> 00:06:52.730\nI had file VaultVersion one turned on.\n\n140\n00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.300\nAnd as I upgrade it to each version,\nall the way up to MacOS Sierra,\n\n141\n00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.150\nit's been fine with that,\nI've left it at FileVault version one.\n\n142\n00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:07.710\nAnd so on this system if I go into my\nSystem Preferences and I go into Security\n\n143\n00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.850\nand Privacy like I was just a moment ago,\nwe're right back into the same place.\n\n144\n00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.246\nWell first of all, I get a warning.\n\n145\n00:07:14.246 --> 00:07:17.400\nYou are using an old version of FileVault,\nright.\n\n146\n00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.910\nIt sees that I'm running version one,\nit doesn't call version one,\n\n147\n00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.540\nit calls it Legacy FileVault.\n\n148\n00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.140\nI'm gonna say, keep using it.\n\n149\n00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.388\nBut when I look at the top,\n\n150\n00:07:24.388 --> 00:07:25.950\nsee how I've got two tabs?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n151\n00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.100\n&gt;&gt; I got FileVault and\n\n152\n00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.480\nLegacy FileVault, right.\n\n153\n00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:35.710\nSo I have support for both, but if I\ntry and upgrade to High Sierra, right.\n\n154\n00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.870\nSo if I go into my Applications,\nI think I've already download it.\n\n155\n00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.990\nYeah, right here.\n\n156\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.440\nHere's my Install MacOS High Sierra.\n\n157\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.180\nIf I try and upgrade to High Sierra,\nwhen I run the installer and\n\n158\n00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:53.030\nI start to move forward, so I'm ready,\nI'm upgrading to 10.13, I'm so excited.\n\n159\n00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.650\nAs I move forward,\n\n160\n00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.040\nwhen I get to the spot where I get\nto pick the disk that I install on.\n\n161\n00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.387\nSee how it's grayed out?\n\n162\n00:07:59.387 --> 00:08:00.710\nAnd if I click on that,\n\n163\n00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.046\nyou may not install to this volume\nbecause it has legacy FileVault users.\n\n164\n00:08:05.046 --> 00:08:05.685\nRight?\n\n165\n00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.688\nSo if you're running High Sierra,\n\n166\n00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:10.700\nyou don't have FileVault version 1 at all,\nright?\n\n167\n00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.345\nBut if you're trying to upgrade to High\nSierra, this can pose a bit of a problem,\n\n168\n00:08:15.345 --> 00:08:18.210\ncuz you're running the older\nversion of Sierra.\n\n169\n00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.910\nI mean the older version of FileVault.\n\n170\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.840\nAnd so it's gonna stop you\nfrom being able to upgrade.\n\n171\n00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.150\nIf you're running an earlier\nversion of Mac OS,\n\n172\n00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.700\nyou could in theory have one or the other.\n\n173\n00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.870\nYou can't have both at the same time,\nlike if I turn on FileVault version 2,\n\n174\n00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.805\nthat breaks FileVault version 1.\n\n175\n00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:37.390\nAnd FileVault version 1 breaks FileVault\nversion 2, they don't co-exist.\n\n176\n00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:42.075\nBut I do have support for\nboth of them in these prior OSs.\n\n177\n00:08:42.075 --> 00:08:44.795\n&gt;&gt; Can you upgrade legacy FileVault to\n\n178\n00:08:44.795 --> 00:08:47.001\nthe new one, to number 2?\n\n179\n00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:50.072\nYeah, yeah, so actually I'd\nhave to here if I wanna upload,\n\n180\n00:08:50.072 --> 00:08:52.000\notherwise it's not gonna let me.\n\n181\n00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.660\nSo I've got a couple of choices\nabout what I wanna do, all right?\n\n182\n00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:00.598\nIf I wanna upgrade,\nwhat Apple recommends is that you\n\n183\n00:09:00.598 --> 00:09:04.045\nturn off legacy FileVault.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n184\n00:09:04.045 --> 00:09:06.646\n&gt;&gt; And once it's off it will decrypt your\n\n185\n00:09:06.646 --> 00:09:07.708\nuser folders.\n\n186\n00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:13.110\nOnce they're decrypted now it's\njust regular unencrypted data.\n\n187\n00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.860\nAnd from there you can do the upgrade,\nand after the upgrade,\n\n188\n00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.060\nyou can turn on FileVault version 2.\n&gt;&gt; Okay that makes sense.\n\n189\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.490\n&gt;&gt; The other option is you could\n\n190\n00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.780\nturn off legacy FileVault, and\nthen turn on FileVault version 2, and\n\n191\n00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:27.610\nthen do the upgrade.\n\n192\n00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.709\nBut Apple recommends doing the upgrade\nfirst, because it's a little bit faster.\n\n193\n00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:33.261\nBut technically your\nmachine is vulnerable, so\n\n194\n00:09:33.261 --> 00:09:35.563\nif you're in a high security environment,\n\n195\n00:09:35.563 --> 00:09:39.500\nyou would rather it go slower on\nthe upgrade than be vulnerable for awhile.\n\n196\n00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.265\nBut all I would have to do,\nlike if I take,\n\n197\n00:09:42.265 --> 00:09:46.840\nlet me get out of the installer here or\nstick it in the background.\n\n198\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.690\nWhen I came into this screen,\nif I were to pull it up again here.\n\n199\n00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.286\nSo if I go into Security and Privacy,\n[LAUGH] it's not gonna do my pop up.\n\n200\n00:09:55.286 --> 00:09:59.670\nLet me just exit out of this, I'll\ndisagree with that license, and get out of\n\n201\n00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:04.473\nthe installer, 20 clicks later I'll get\nback into my [LAUGH] system preferences.\n\n202\n00:10:04.473 --> 00:10:05.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n203\n00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.370\n&gt;&gt; I moved really fast over it but\n\n204\n00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.080\nwhen that pop up came up, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n205\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.499\n&gt;&gt; It told me I'm running an old version,\n\n206\n00:10:11.499 --> 00:10:12.577\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n207\n00:10:12.577 --> 00:10:14.468\n&gt;&gt; And it doesn't give me a button that\n\n208\n00:10:14.468 --> 00:10:18.437\nsays upgrade, it just gives me a button\nthat says keep using the old stuff or\n\n209\n00:10:18.437 --> 00:10:20.241\nturn it off, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n210\n00:10:20.241 --> 00:10:22.371\n&gt;&gt; And if I turn it off, it will decrypt\n\n211\n00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:25.160\nthose user home directories.\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n212\n00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.325\n&gt;&gt; If you're ever curious to detect\n\n213\n00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:30.419\nwhether somebody is using\na legacy FileVault,\n\n214\n00:10:30.419 --> 00:10:33.215\nyou can actually see\nit in the Home folder.\n\n215\n00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:37.170\nThere's something,\nmake this bigger cuz it's microscopic.\n\n216\n00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.233\nAll right, so if you browse in\nthe terminal to the /Users folder and\n\n217\n00:10:41.233 --> 00:10:44.383\nyou take a look,\nhere's the user folders, right?\n\n218\n00:10:44.383 --> 00:10:49.228\nSo normally if I were to browse\ninto helpdesk or into dpezet,\n\n219\n00:10:49.228 --> 00:10:55.597\nI would see a Desktop folder,Documents,\nLibrary, Music, Videos, right?\n\n220\n00:10:55.597 --> 00:10:58.485\nAll the folders that make up your profile.\n\n221\n00:10:58.485 --> 00:11:02.235\nIn fact if I use the Finder, and\n\n222\n00:11:02.235 --> 00:11:08.330\nI were to browse into my Home folder,\nso I'm just gonna go to my Home folder.\n\n223\n00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.530\nAnd I look, so here's my Home\nfolder when I use the Finder.\n\n224\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.400\nThere's Desktop, Documents,\nMovies, Downloads, and so on.\n\n225\n00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.471\nBut when I browse there in the terminal,\nI'll go into my Home folder and I'll take\n\n226\n00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:23.430\na look, and there everything is, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n227\n00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.180\n&gt;&gt; All broken down here as folders.\n\n228\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.068\nBut if I were to log out,\nwhat I would see, and\n\n229\n00:11:28.068 --> 00:11:31.273\nactually helpdesk should be like this,\nwhoops.\n\n230\n00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:39.480\nI don't have permissions in that folder,\nso I've got to sudo for that, there we go.\n\n231\n00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.370\nWhen I look inside of the helpdesk folder,\nsee what I see?\n\n232\n00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.760\nI don't see a Documents folder,\nI don't see Applications,\n\n233\n00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.230\nI see helpdesk.sparsebundle.\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n234\n00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.420\n&gt;&gt; That's an encrypted file that\n\n235\n00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.750\nhas the profile.\n\n236\n00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:58.010\nAnd when helpdesk logs in,\nit will unlock that account and\n\n237\n00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:03.510\nmount that folder right there\nin a form that's accessible.\n\n238\n00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.708\nSo my Home folder,\nit looks like I see all these folders, but\n\n239\n00:12:07.708 --> 00:12:09.480\nthose folders aren't actually there.\n\n240\n00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.423\nSo if I take a look at like my paths,\nsee how I'm in search /Users?\n\n241\n00:12:13.423 --> 00:12:20.550\nAnd then if I go into Documents, wait a\nminute, it says no such file or directory.\n\n242\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.427\nBut I can clearly see\nDocuments right there, right?\n\n243\n00:12:22.427 --> 00:12:23.433\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n244\n00:12:23.433 --> 00:12:26.783\nBut if I look at a little more\ndetailed I can see, whoops, but\n\n245\n00:12:26.783 --> 00:12:28.275\nI'm in the wrong folder.\n\n246\n00:12:28.275 --> 00:12:30.240\n[LAUGH] There.\n\n247\n00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.832\nI can see that when I look at Documents,\n\n248\n00:12:32.832 --> 00:12:37.086\nit does show as a folder and\nnow I can browse into it, there we go.\n\n249\n00:12:37.086 --> 00:12:38.520\nIf I'm in the right place,\nI can browse into it.\n\n250\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:43.950\nAnd it shows us /Users/dpezet/Documents,\nbut that's not actually what's happening.\n\n251\n00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.670\nI'm browsing inside of my\nown sparsebundle, right?\n\n252\n00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.890\nOr I don't have FileVault turned on,\none or the other.\n\n253\n00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.140\nAnd I can see that inside a disk utility,\n\n254\n00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.411\nin disk utility it will show where\nthat sparsebundle is mounted.\n\n255\n00:12:58.411 --> 00:13:01.940\nOr actually, you know what,\nI'm not gonna see it there,\n\n256\n00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.120\nI think I have to do a diskutil list.\n\n257\n00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.901\nThere we go, and now,\nwhen I look inside of here,\n\n258\n00:13:06.901 --> 00:13:11.293\nsee how I've got my Macintosh HD like I\nwould expect, my recovery hard drive?\n\n259\n00:13:11.293 --> 00:13:11.953\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n260\n00:13:11.953 --> 00:13:13.220\n&gt;&gt; These are things I expect.\n\n261\n00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.145\nHere's this other hard\ndrive called dpezet,\n\n262\n00:13:16.145 --> 00:13:19.950\nthat's my sparsebundle that's\nbeen mounted to that folder.\n\n263\n00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:24.608\nWhen I'm browsing to that folder I'm\nactually in a encrypted folder at that\n\n264\n00:13:24.608 --> 00:13:25.126\npoint.\n\n265\n00:13:25.126 --> 00:13:27.410\nSo that's how FileVault version 1 worked.\n\n266\n00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.360\nAnd the big problem with FileVault version\n1, it only encrypted your Home folder.\n\n267\n00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.530\nSo what if you save something\noutside of your Home folder?\n\n268\n00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.047\nIt wasn't encrypted, right?\n\n269\n00:13:36.047 --> 00:13:40.221\nAnd plenty of applications store data in\nother folders outside of your Home folder,\n\n270\n00:13:40.221 --> 00:13:42.237\nand that meant it could be compromised.\n\n271\n00:13:42.237 --> 00:13:45.969\nAlso means that somebody could\ninstall a key logger, a Trojan,\n\n272\n00:13:45.969 --> 00:13:49.423\nsome other kind of malware\noutside of your Home folder, and\n\n273\n00:13:49.423 --> 00:13:52.001\nwhen you log in it\nunlocks your Home folder.\n\n274\n00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:55.080\nAnd now that Trojan or\nwhatever would have access to it.\n\n275\n00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.325\nIt's much better to encrypt the entire\nhard drive, and that's what FileVault\n\n276\n00:14:00.325 --> 00:14:05.160\ntwo does, and that's why Apple doesn't\nlet you turn on legacy FileVault anymore.\n\n277\n00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.570\nSo if I wanted to upgrade, step one,\nturn off legacy FileVault,\n\n278\n00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.570\nand if I'm looking at the pop-up,\nI can use it here.\n\n279\n00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.100\nOr if I don't,\nI can go into Security and Privacy,\n\n280\n00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.990\ngo into Legacy FileVault, and\nI can choose Turn Off Legacy FileVault.\n\n281\n00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.593\nThat will decrypt all those home folders,\nget rid of those sparse bundles and\n\n282\n00:14:23.593 --> 00:14:25.654\njust put all the encrypted\ndata on the disk.\n\n283\n00:14:25.654 --> 00:14:29.459\nAnd from there, whoops,\nI can go over to FileVault and\n\n284\n00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:33.060\nI can turn it on and\nit'll encrypt the entire disk.\n\n285\n00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.270\nYou can't do both at the same time,\nit won't let you.\n\n286\n00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:40.030\nTurn one off, turn the other on.\n&gt;&gt; So now that the old FileVault is gone,\n\n287\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.590\nlet's take a look at FileVault 2,\nhow about that?\n\n288\n00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.402\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n289\n00:14:43.402 --> 00:14:48.460\nonce the old FileVault's gone, that Legacy\nFileVault tab will disappear, right?\n\n290\n00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.087\nIt only shows up while you have at least\none user with legacy FileVault turned\n\n291\n00:14:52.087 --> 00:14:52.690\non.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n292\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.962\n&gt;&gt; So the moment it's off you'll see\n\n293\n00:14:54.962 --> 00:14:59.895\na screen that looks exactly like this,\nand from here I can turn on FileVault\n\n294\n00:14:59.895 --> 00:15:01.570\nversion 2.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n295\n00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.340\n&gt;&gt; If the screen is locked you'll need to\n\n296\n00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.370\nunlock it, you have to be an administrator\nto turn this on because it\n\n297\n00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:10.460\nencrypts the entire disk, and then we can\nchoose the one button that's on here.\n\n298\n00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.640\nThis Advanced button actually pertains to\nthe System Preference panel as a whole,\n\n299\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.280\nnot to FileVault.\n\n300\n00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.200\nSo you really just have one button,\nI'll click the one button that I have.\n\n301\n00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.880\nAnd it's gonna say, all right,\n\n302\n00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.090\nwe're getting ready,\nwe're gonna encrypt your whole disk.\n\n303\n00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.165\nBut, in order to access the disk,\nyou have to have a private key.\n\n304\n00:15:27.165 --> 00:15:31.660\nThat private key is gonna be encrypted,\nand stored here on the system as well.\n\n305\n00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.597\nAnd your user password will be used\nto unlock the private key, and\n\n306\n00:15:35.597 --> 00:15:38.040\nthat private key then unlocks the disk.\n\n307\n00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.995\nThere's actually two keys involved,\nyour user password, and\n\n308\n00:15:40.995 --> 00:15:43.300\nthen the private key that\nis stored in the system.\n\n309\n00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.890\nIf I forget my user password,\nguess what happens?\n\n310\n00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.282\n&gt;&gt; You're not getting in there.\n\n311\n00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:51.017\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You are not, absolutely.\n\n312\n00:15:51.017 --> 00:15:53.564\nApple won't even help the NSA with this\n\n313\n00:15:53.564 --> 00:15:54.240\nstuff.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n314\n00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.260\n&gt;&gt; They definitely won't help us.\n\n315\n00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.050\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n316\n00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:57.709\n&gt;&gt; If we lose our password,\n\n317\n00:15:57.709 --> 00:15:59.452\nthat data's encrypted.\n\n318\n00:15:59.452 --> 00:16:02.756\nIf Apple offered to decrypt it,\nthat would defeat the whole purpose,\n\n319\n00:16:02.756 --> 00:16:05.876\nthat would invalidate the encryption.\n&gt;&gt; They're tough on that.\n\n320\n00:16:05.876 --> 00:16:07.947\nVery much so, and\nthen they're willing to go to court.\n\n321\n00:16:07.947 --> 00:16:09.051\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n322\n00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:10.646\n&gt;&gt; So, if you forget your password,\n\n323\n00:16:10.646 --> 00:16:11.640\nyou're out of luck.\n\n324\n00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.370\nThe data is gone.\n\n325\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.380\nMaybe you have a Time Machine\nbackup you can restore,\n\n326\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.410\nbut I would hope that's encrypted as well.\n\n327\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:18.160\nAnd if you forgot your password,\n\n328\n00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.170\nyou probably won't be able\nto recover that, either.\n\n329\n00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.700\nSo, there's nothing worse.\n\n330\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.810\nThe only thing worse than not having\na backup is having a backup you can't\n\n331\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.120\naccess cuz you don't know its password.\n&gt;&gt; It's just awful.\n\n332\n00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.050\n&gt;&gt; So, they offer two different ways\n\n333\n00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.670\nto help with this.\n\n334\n00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.010\nIf you forget your password,\nwhat do you do, all right?\n\n335\n00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:40.610\nOption one, the one they recommend,\nis you can use your iCloud account\n\n336\n00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.210\nto reset your local machine password and\ngain access to the disk, right?\n\n337\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.644\nThat's good in a way because if\nyou forget your iCloud password,\n\n338\n00:16:47.644 --> 00:16:50.165\nyou can always do a password reset,\nyou can call up their help line,\n\n339\n00:16:50.165 --> 00:16:51.994\nthey'll help you get\ninto your iCloud account.\n\n340\n00:16:51.994 --> 00:16:55.070\nOnce you're in then you\ncan access your system.\n\n341\n00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.185\nBut it's bad in a way in that you're\neffectively making a workaround, and there\n\n342\n00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:03.181\nhave been some social engineering attacks\nwhere people call Apple Support and\n\n343\n00:17:03.181 --> 00:17:05.500\ntrick them into resetting an account.\n\n344\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:10.090\nSo that's not necessarily\nthe greatest way to go about it.\n\n345\n00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:15.370\nThe next option though, create a recovery\nkey and do not use my iCloud account.\n\n346\n00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:18.320\nThis is the one that you can rely on.\n\n347\n00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.380\nIt's gonna generate a recovery key.\n\n348\n00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.340\nAnd it's gonna put that on the screen\nhere in just a moment, and when it does,\n\n349\n00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:28.950\nit's gonna show that key to you\none time and one time only.\n\n350\n00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.512\nYou'll never see this key again.\n\n351\n00:17:31.512 --> 00:17:33.136\nThis is the only time\nthat it's gonna show up.\n\n352\n00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:36.200\nSo I'm gonna choose to\ncreate that recovery key and\n\n353\n00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.590\nwhen I hit continue here's my key,\nall right?\n\n354\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:44.105\nNow, notice there's no save as\nbutton here or copy to clipboard?\n\n355\n00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:44.750\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n356\n00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.130\n&gt;&gt; And that's because you don't wanna save\n\n357\n00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.550\nthis key on your machine cuz we're\nabout to encrypt your machine.\n\n358\n00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.290\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n359\n00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.380\n&gt;&gt; If you forget your password,\n\n360\n00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.350\nyou need this key to decrypt it.\n\n361\n00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.750\nIf it's on the encrypted media, it's like\n\n362\n00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.315\nlocking your keys in your car, right?\n\n363\n00:17:59.315 --> 00:18:00.380\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; You don't want\n\n364\n00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.740\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n365\n00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.924\n&gt;&gt; So what they want you do is to write\n\n366\n00:18:03.924 --> 00:18:04.711\nthis down.\n\n367\n00:18:04.711 --> 00:18:09.326\nAnd you got a choice, you actually can\nhighlight it and copy it, right but\n\n368\n00:18:09.326 --> 00:18:12.540\nthink about what you're\ngonna do with this.\n\n369\n00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.817\nIf you paste it in an email and email it\nto yourself, I know a lot of people that\n\n370\n00:18:15.817 --> 00:18:17.982\ndo that, email is unencrypted by default.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n371\n00:18:17.982 --> 00:18:19.406\n&gt;&gt; And if anybody gains access to your\n\n372\n00:18:19.406 --> 00:18:21.540\nmailbox, now they have your recovery key.\n\n373\n00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.616\nThis needs to be stored securely.\n\n374\n00:18:22.616 --> 00:18:26.210\nThe intention is that you print it out.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n375\n00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.330\n&gt;&gt; And that you take that piece of paper\n\n376\n00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.554\nand lock it in a safe.\n&gt;&gt; Could you put it on a USB, Don, and\n\n377\n00:18:31.554 --> 00:18:35.230\nthen store that too, I mean.\n&gt;&gt; You sure could, yay, absolutely.\n\n378\n00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.169\nSo you stick a USB key on, copy this,\n\n379\n00:18:37.169 --> 00:18:39.584\npaste it in a text file on that USB key.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n380\n00:18:39.584 --> 00:18:43.449\nthen lock that away.\n&gt;&gt; And that's the key piece right there,\n\n381\n00:18:43.449 --> 00:18:47.690\nZack, is what happens if l put it on a USB\nkey and l leave the USB key on my desk?\n\n382\n00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.549\nWhen they steal my laptop, they could\nsteal that key and now they can unlock it.\n\n383\n00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:54.829\n&gt;&gt; Forget about it, yeah.\n\n384\n00:18:54.829 --> 00:18:56.995\n&gt;&gt; So, this key needs to be protected.\n\n385\n00:18:56.995 --> 00:19:00.480\nNow here on the show I don't\nreally care about this key, and so\n\n386\n00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.840\nI'm gonna do something\ncuz I do need the key.\n\n387\n00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.350\nI'm gonna take my cell phone and\n\n388\n00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.200\nI'm just gonna take a picture.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, there you go.\n\n389\n00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:06.890\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n390\n00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.630\nthis is the cheater's\nway to remember things.\n\n391\n00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.370\nSo I'm gonna take a quick picture of\nthat key so I've got it, there we go.\n\n392\n00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.550\nAnd now if I forget my\npassword I can go to that.\n\n393\n00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.350\nNow, if I took a picture on my phone\n&gt;&gt; Good idea bad idea,\n\n394\n00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.740\nit depends.\n&gt;&gt; It depends yeah.\n\n395\n00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.670\n&gt;&gt; If you have an iPhone and\n\n396\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.040\nyou're running the newer iOS, iOS 11 and\n\n397\n00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.750\nhigher, they are encrypted by default,\nmy phone's encrypted.\n\n398\n00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.070\nIf you got iCloud it's syncing\nyour photos up to iCloud so\n\n399\n00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.610\nyou might be protected there as\nwell right, so you may be safe.\n\n400\n00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.660\nOr maybe you're using some third\nparty photo backup software and\n\n401\n00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.830\nit's not encrypted well now a photo of\nyour key is out there in an unencrypted\n\n402\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.621\nform, so you gotta be careful of that.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n403\n00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:48.568\n&gt;&gt; Taking a picture is not always\n\n404\n00:19:48.568 --> 00:19:51.070\nthe greatest idea be careful with that.\n\n405\n00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.310\nAnd I was acting under\nthe assumption you have an iPhone.\n\n406\n00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.055\nIf you don't,\nmaybe you have an android phone.\n\n407\n00:19:55.055 --> 00:19:55.720\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n408\n00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.900\n&gt;&gt; Who knows if it's encrypted or not.\n\n409\n00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.290\nIt's the Wild West with Android.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n410\n00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.000\n&gt;&gt; So, you gotta look at whichever.\n\n411\n00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.910\n&gt;&gt; Isn't it the truth.\n\n412\n00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.099\n&gt;&gt; So, you gotta look at whichever\n\n413\n00:20:03.099 --> 00:20:05.345\nvendor it is or model,\nto find out whether that's the safest\n\n414\n00:20:05.345 --> 00:20:06.113\nway to do it.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,\n\n415\n00:20:06.113 --> 00:20:10.160\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Ideally do as Zach said, save that\n\n416\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.520\nkey as a text found on your USB key or-\n&gt;&gt; Lock it away.\n\n417\n00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.032\n&gt;&gt; Write it on a piece of paper,\n\n418\n00:20:15.032 --> 00:20:17.052\nlock it away and go the old school way.\n\n419\n00:20:17.052 --> 00:20:20.048\nBut once I hit continue that's it,\nthat key is gone, right.\n\n420\n00:20:20.048 --> 00:20:23.594\nWell, I mean I guess we recorded\nthe show so anybody could go back and\n\n421\n00:20:23.594 --> 00:20:26.531\nactually you out there on TV\nland you've got my key now.\n\n422\n00:20:26.531 --> 00:20:30.240\nI had that on the screen for like\na solid five minutes while I yammered.\n\n423\n00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.460\nAnybody could have written that down.\n\n424\n00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.400\nAnd if you were to break into this\nbuilding and steal my laptop.\n\n425\n00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.850\nWell actually this is a virtual machine.\n\n426\n00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.520\nSo you have to steal my virtual machine.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n427\n00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.670\n&gt;&gt; And then you could use that key and\n\n428\n00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:41.258\nyou could decrypt it.\n\n429\n00:20:41.258 --> 00:20:44.440\nAnd you can access all of my\nsecret information on this\n\n430\n00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.500\nfresh install that has-\n&gt;&gt; On his VM.\n\n431\n00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.105\n&gt;&gt; But I joke about it,\n\n432\n00:20:48.105 --> 00:20:49.550\ncuz there's nothing of value here.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n433\n00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.720\n&gt;&gt; But if this was my actual laptop, and\n\n434\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.010\nyou had that key, then yeah,\nthat would be a problem.\n\n435\n00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:54.830\n&gt;&gt; That would be a problem.\n\n436\n00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.230\n&gt;&gt; Those would be the keys to the kingdom.\n\n437\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:01.375\nNow, once I hit continue,\nit's now encrypting my hard drive, right?\n\n438\n00:21:01.375 --> 00:21:05.740\nWith Follow Up Version 1,\nit made you log out.\n\n439\n00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.610\nAnd it kept you logged out\nthe whole time while it encrypted,\n\n440\n00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.560\nyou couldn't use your computer.\n\n441\n00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:13.520\nBut with Follow Up Version 2, because\nit's operating at the disk level it's\n\n442\n00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.580\nactually able to encrypt\nwhile you're in the system.\n\n443\n00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.385\nSo I'm still logged in,\nI'm working and it's encrypting away.\n\n444\n00:21:19.385 --> 00:21:21.590\nIt's telling me I got one hour remaining,\ntwo hours remaining.\n\n445\n00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.900\nThe length of time this\ntakes depends on two things,\n\n446\n00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.010\nit depends on your CPU, and\nhow much storage you have.\n\n447\n00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.510\nIf you have a low-end Mac that's\ngot like an i3 processor in it or\n\n448\n00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:39.090\na mobile processor it can take a while,\non a higher-end Mac it'll go a lot faster.\n\n449\n00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.000\nAlso if you have a 1 terabyte drive,\nthat's\n\n450\n00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.140\ngonna take a lot longer than a 250 gig\ndrive, so those are all factor into this.\n\n451\n00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.180\nIt can take a long time,\nmy Mac mini it took like six hours\n\n452\n00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.520\nto encrypt on that one.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n453\n00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.932\n&gt;&gt; It was a terabyte drive,\n\n454\n00:21:52.932 --> 00:21:57.640\nit's a spinning disc not an SSD and it's\ngot an i5, like a mid-level processor so\n\n455\n00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.810\nit just took six hours.\n\n456\n00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:03.220\nThe nice thing here is you can use\nthe system while it's encrypting.\n\n457\n00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.050\nYou're not safe yet,\nyour data's not fully protected yet.\n\n458\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.520\nBut I can get in here and\nrun applications, browse the web,\n\n459\n00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.490\ncheck my email.\n\n460\n00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.860\nThe system will run a little bit\nslower but that's not a big deal,\n\n461\n00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.020\nI'm still able to use the system.\n\n462\n00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.490\nI normally start this and go home.\n\n463\n00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:18.728\nStart it at the end of the day and\n\n464\n00:22:18.728 --> 00:22:23.040\nthat way when you come in in the morning\nit's all encrypted in you're in business.\n\n465\n00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.735\nBut basically it's gonna run,\nwe just let it do its job and\n\n466\n00:22:25.735 --> 00:22:28.770\nit's gonna encrypt the disc, right.\n\n467\n00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:32.160\nAt this point we could go and start\nencrypting our other media, USB keys and\n\n468\n00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.730\nso on but you don't wanna start more than\none encryption process at the same time\n\n469\n00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.780\nbecause it does slow the system\ndown more and more with each go.\n\n470\n00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:42.700\nBut at this point\nFollow Up Version 2 is turning on.\n\n471\n00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.190\nAnd soon our data is going to be safe\nregardless of who gets their hands\n\n472\n00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.080\non the computer.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n473\n00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.920\nthis might be the most rhetorical\nquestion in the world,\n\n474\n00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.547\nbut what if we forget our password?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n475\n00:22:53.547 --> 00:22:57.490\nif you forget your password,\nthen you've got to do password recovery.\n\n476\n00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.630\nPassword recovery is\nactually not that bad.\n\n477\n00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:03.910\nThere's a few ways to work around it where\nyou not gonna be completely out of luck.\n\n478\n00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:09.240\nAnd the key that we just generated we can\nuse that to get back into our system.\n\n479\n00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.190\nNow I wanna show that to you but\nit says that I've got an hour\n\n480\n00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.670\nremaining on this encryption process,\nso why don't we do this Zach.\n\n481\n00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:15.680\nWhy don't we break this up into a two\n\n482\n00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.710\nparter.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n483\n00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:17.570\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n484\n00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:22.910\nwhen we come back in part 2 this will\nbe done and we'll prove that it's done,\n\n485\n00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.040\nso we'll actually see that\nthe encryption is complete.\n\n486\n00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.230\nAnd then we'll use that key to recover and\n\n487\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:30.150\nget into our system,\nassuming we have the key.\n\n488\n00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:35.037\nNow if somewhere between now and\npart 2 I lose my key, what happens then?\n\n489\n00:23:35.037 --> 00:23:35.798\n&gt;&gt;

No.\n\n497\n00:23:48.772 --> 00:23:49.493\n&gt;&gt; But we'll get\n\n498\n00:23:49.493 --> 00:23:53.220\na chance to see all that in part 2 we'll\nrecover as if we had lost our key and\n\n499\n00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.125\nsee that it's really not that bad.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, excellent episode,\n\n500\n00:23:56.125 --> 00:23:59.015\nsecuring data part 1 securing\ndata part 2 coming up,\n\n501\n00:23:59.015 --> 00:24:01.685\nApple Certified Support Professional\nwonderful series.\n\n502\n00:24:01.685 --> 00:24:06.256\nBefore we move on Don, last words?\n&gt;&gt; In my opinion, Follow Up Version 2\n\n503\n00:24:06.256 --> 00:24:11.040\nit's not optional, you should have\nit turned on on every computer.\n\n504\n00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.609\nOnce it's enabled, it doesn't like it\nbarely affects your boot performance and\n\n505\n00:24:14.609 --> 00:24:17.320\nthen of that you don't even\nknow notice that it's on.\n\n506\n00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.560\nSo definitely turn it on, if you haven't\nalready, check your Mac it's super easy.\n\n507\n00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.825\nTurn it on, you'll be glad that you did.\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:13.387\n&gt;&gt; You’re watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for watching.\n\n4\n00:00:13.387 --> 00:00:16.735\nYou're watching ITPro.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:20.965\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue on\nwith Apple certified support professional.\n\n6\n00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:25.950\nSecuring data part two is the episode\nright now, make sure you see part one.\n\n7\n00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.690\nAnd the person bringing us all the\ninformation we need is the one, the only,\n\n8\n00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.810\nDoz Pezet.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach.\n\n9\n00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.440\nThanks for having me back.\n\n10\n00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.230\nAnd I'm ready to continue\ngetting secure here.\n\n11\n00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.670\nIn episode one we got a chance\nto see File Vault and\n\n12\n00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.680\nhow we can encrypt our disk and\nget that all set up.\n\n13\n00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.520\nWe ended the show while waiting for\n\n14\n00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.820\nFile Vault finish encrypting my disc.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n15\n00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.950\n&gt;&gt; It said it was gonna take a little bit\n\n16\n00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:49.470\nof time.\n\n17\n00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.770\nAnd so that 's kinda been running.\n\n18\n00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.510\nIt's done now.\n\n19\n00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.520\nSo in this episode,\nwe're gonna pick back up with it.\n\n20\n00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.870\nGive you a chance to see what it can do.\n\n21\n00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.540\nAnd see a few other ways we can\nsecure data inside of Mac OS.\n\n22\n00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.220\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n23\n00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.690\nFile Vault two, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n24\n00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.820\n&gt;&gt; That's great, that's great.\n\n25\n00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.260\nBut what happens, though,\n\n26\n00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.750\nif we forget our password?\n&gt;&gt; All right, that's a big concern.\n\n27\n00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.900\nI think that was the actual\nquestion we ended the last show\n\n28\n00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.430\non.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n29\n00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.610\n&gt;&gt; Which is, hey, once we're encrypted,\n\n30\n00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.620\nthings are nice and safe, and secure.\n\n31\n00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.310\nAnd it's easy to forget that we even\nhave File Vault turned on, right?\n\n32\n00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.290\nSo, for example here, if we go back to my\nmachine, and let me just zoom in on this.\n\n33\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.900\nSo basically when we left the end of part\none, this said that it was encrypting and\n\n34\n00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.040\nthat we had 20 minutes remaining or\nsomething like that.\n\n35\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.360\nAfter a little while,\nwhen it's done, it finishes and\n\n36\n00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.710\nin an unusually small font it\nwrites encryption finished.\n\n37\n00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.870\nAnd I don't know why that one's such\na small font compared to the others.\n\n38\n00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.412\n&gt;&gt; A good magnifying glass to take\n\n39\n00:01:41.412 --> 00:01:43.364\na look at that.\n&gt;&gt; The other fonts are very big.\n\n40\n00:01:43.364 --> 00:01:45.290\nBut either way, it's done, right?\n\n41\n00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.020\nSo now I'm encrypted,\nmy entire disk is encrypted,\n\n42\n00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.670\nand as an end user, things don't\nreally look any different, do they?\n\n43\n00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.840\nIf they browse their Finder,\nand they go in here and\n\n44\n00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.070\nfind their hard drive,\nas they browse around their desktop,\n\n45\n00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.130\ntheir documents, none of this looks any\ndifferent from what they're used to.\n\n46\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.880\nSo that's the tricky part about File Vault\nis that it really secures your information\n\n47\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.250\nand it does it in a way\nthat's transparent, so\n\n48\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.780\nit's easy to forget that\nyou've even got it.\n\n49\n00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.640\nIn fact, the only way a person would\nreally notice is if they're a really\n\n50\n00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.240\nsharp observer.\n\n51\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.750\nWhen you boot up a Mac,\nyou normally see the Apple logo,\n\n52\n00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.250\nthe little bar crawls across the bottom,\nand then we see the login screen.\n\n53\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.390\nWhen you enable File Vault,\nit reverses those.\n\n54\n00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.280\nYou actually see the log\nin screen first and\n\n55\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.940\nthen the apple with the bar going across,\nbecause it needs you to\n\n56\n00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.580\nprovide your password in order\nto unlock the drive, right?\n\n57\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.700\nTo decrypt the drive and\ngive us that access.\n\n58\n00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.388\nSo now that File Vault almost turned on\nhere, I'll just do a restart here and\n\n59\n00:02:46.388 --> 00:02:47.650\nwe'll watch it.\n\n60\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.130\nWhen I restart this machine, it's gonna\ngo offline and this is a virtual machine,\n\n61\n00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.020\nso I'll see like a little VMWare\nscreen will pop up for a second.\n\n62\n00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.525\nBut then it's gonna go into the regular\nboot process, and when it starts to boot\n\n63\n00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:02.635\nwhich will happen any moment now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n64\n00:03:02.635 --> 00:03:04.605\n&gt;&gt; But when it starts to boot, well,\n\n65\n00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:06.145\nactually, let me explain this.\n\n66\n00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:07.325\nSo, we have followed through now,\n\n67\n00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:08.925\nit actually takes a little\nlonger to shut down.\n\n68\n00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:09.875\nI see this black screen.\n\n69\n00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:11.095\nI actually haven't rebooted yet.\n\n70\n00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:13.505\nRight, when I see that VM screen,\nthat's when it actually reboots.\n\n71\n00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:15.165\nHere, it's still shutting down.\n\n72\n00:03:15.165 --> 00:03:19.125\nThat if there is any non-committed rights\non the disc, it's got to finish writing\n\n73\n00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:21.905\nthose so that it can encrypt them,\nand put them onto the disc.\n\n74\n00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:24.590\nAnd sometimes that can\ntake a little bit of time.\n\n75\n00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.990\nOn a Mac Mini or on a virtual machine\nlike this, we don't normally care.\n\n76\n00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.160\nWe just it's a black screen and\n\n77\n00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.540\nyou walk away.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n78\n00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.530\n&gt;&gt; On a laptop,\n\n79\n00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.370\nthis can cause a bit of a problem.\n\n80\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.680\nBecause I might think my laptop is\npowered off and I close the lid.\n\n81\n00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.110\nI stick it in my backpack and off I go.\n\n82\n00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.560\nWell, in your backpack,\nthe fans still might be running,\n\n83\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.060\nit might still be generating heat and\nso on.\n\n84\n00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.320\nAnd you could actually go into thermal\nshutdown if you're not careful.\n\n85\n00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.980\n&gt;&gt; Not good.\n\n86\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.340\n&gt;&gt; So after a few moments of that\n\n87\n00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.400\nthe black screen went away and\nthen actually did reboot.\n\n88\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.744\nSo we just saw the VM screen.\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n89\n00:03:54.744 --> 00:03:56.248\n&gt;&gt; And then I did see an apple for\n\n90\n00:03:56.248 --> 00:03:58.926\na moment and\nthen it took me to the log-in screen.\n\n91\n00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:04.874\nNow this login screen is different\nthan a normal login screen.\n\n92\n00:04:04.874 --> 00:04:08.838\nThe primary difference is, well, you'll\nnotice the black bars on the left or\n\n93\n00:04:08.838 --> 00:04:10.530\nright side of my screen, right?\n\n94\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.440\nIt hasn't loaded any special drivers yet.\n\n95\n00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.750\nOn a normal login screen,\nit's already loaded hard drivers, so\n\n96\n00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.970\nit fills up your monitor.\n\n97\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.240\nYour nice 16 by 9 resolution,\nit fills the whole thing.\n\n98\n00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.300\nHere it hasn't loaded any\nspecial drivers yet, and so\n\n99\n00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.590\nI get little black bars on the side.\n\n100\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.526\nThe other thing is the coloring is\na little off from what the normal login\n\n101\n00:04:29.526 --> 00:04:30.192\nscreen is.\n\n102\n00:04:30.192 --> 00:04:33.462\nMost users wouldn't notice but\nit is a little bit off,\n\n103\n00:04:33.462 --> 00:04:37.955\nlike this box here isn't white,\nit's a light gray on top of a darker gray.\n\n104\n00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:39.147\nIt's a little subtle change.\n\n105\n00:04:39.147 --> 00:04:41.160\nMost end users wouldn't even notice.\n\n106\n00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.838\nThey'd come in, they'd punch in their\npassword, and they'd go to log in.\n\n107\n00:04:44.838 --> 00:04:49.562\nAnd once they log in, then they get\ninto [INAUDIBLE] the apple comes up in\n\n108\n00:04:49.562 --> 00:04:53.180\nlittle bar codes across and\nthey get logged in.\n\n109\n00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.470\nSo a different order\nthan what we're used to.\n\n110\n00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.242\nNow when we go to log in, what we're\nactually doing is giving it our password.\n\n111\n00:05:01.242 --> 00:05:06.155\nIt takes the password, it finds where\nthe encrypted private key of File Vault is\n\n112\n00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:09.500\nstored and\nit decrypts it using our password.\n\n113\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.630\nOnce it has the File Vault key,\n\n114\n00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.010\nthen it can unlock the rest of the drive\nwhich is where the operating system is.\n\n115\n00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.310\nSo only after I provide that key\nis it then able to boot up, so\n\n116\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.820\nit's gonna take it and\nit's gonna run with it, right?\n\n117\n00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.044\nAnd so it's gonna start booting that\noperating system here any moment now.\n\n118\n00:05:25.044 --> 00:05:27.350\nIt's making me nervous just\nsitting here like this.\n\n119\n00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.150\nNow the first time I typed my password\nin I must've typed it wrong, right,\n\n120\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.290\ncuz I got an error that told\nme my password was wrong.\n\n121\n00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.380\nIt can't do anything for me at that\npoint if I don't give it the password,\n\n122\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.300\ncuz it can't find the operating system.\n\n123\n00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.070\nHere it's just seeing the File Vault\nlogin screen and that's that, right?\n\n124\n00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.545\nIt's not actually able to see beyond it.\n\n125\n00:05:46.545 --> 00:05:49.755\nOnce I provided the password,\nthen it can go and unlock the disk and\n\n126\n00:05:49.755 --> 00:05:51.265\nget us the rest of the way through.\n\n127\n00:05:51.265 --> 00:05:54.285\nSo you probably noticed where I typed my\npassword wrong the first time, right?\n\n128\n00:05:54.285 --> 00:05:55.355\nIt just gave me a little message.\n\n129\n00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.605\nAnd then I typed it right the second time,\nand moved on.\n\n130\n00:05:57.605 --> 00:06:02.765\nActually I'm logging out of here right\nnow, but the thing about that is,\n\n131\n00:06:02.765 --> 00:06:07.010\nwhen I provided it the wrong password,\nwhat can it do for me?\n\n132\n00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.980\nIt really can't do anything.\n&gt;&gt; Not much.\n\n133\n00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.880\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't\n\n134\n00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.450\nhave great network connectivity or\naccess to the operating system yet,\n\n135\n00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.020\nthe whole disc is encrypted,\nso it needs that password.\n\n136\n00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.890\nIf I don't know my password,\nI can't unlock it, and I can't re-set or\n\n137\n00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.020\nanything, so I've got to have my password.\n\n138\n00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.660\nAnd we mentioned that in part one.\n\n139\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.340\nIf you lose your password,\nthat's a real problem, right,\n\n140\n00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.210\nthat Apple can't decrypt it for you.\n\n141\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.880\nYou've got to have your password\nto log in or your recovery key.\n\n142\n00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.833\nAnd if you've got your recovery key,\nyou can get in there and you can basically\n\n143\n00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:44.312\nunlock the system to be able to get\nin there and recover your data.\n\n144\n00:06:44.312 --> 00:06:48.364\nSo you're not completely without\nrecourse on this stuff, but\n\n145\n00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:53.180\nyour password is really the key, well,\nit's a little redundant I guess,\n\n146\n00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.926\nit's the key to getting access\nto your system, because it\n\n147\n00:06:56.926 --> 00:07:02.130\nbecomes that unlocks the private key\nthat's encrypted your hard drive.\n\n148\n00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.900\nReally critical thing.\n\n149\n00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.260\nBut for most users, they're gonna log\nin like normal and may not even notice.\n\n150\n00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.740\nThey just type in their password,\nthey hit Next.\n\n151\n00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.570\nThe fact that the apple with\nthe white bar comes up second,\n\n152\n00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.770\nmost people don't even register that.\n\n153\n00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.730\nAnd then they log in and\nhave no idea the disk is encrypted.\n\n154\n00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.190\nNow the only time they do notice\nis if they forget their password.\n\n155\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.710\nAnd then they come to me and\nthey say, Don, I forgot my password.\n\n156\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.020\nCan you help me reset it?\n\n157\n00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.783\nAnd I look at the system and\nI say, you've got File Vault,\n\n158\n00:07:27.783 --> 00:07:30.128\nI can't reset your password, right?\n\n159\n00:07:30.128 --> 00:07:32.810\nI can't reset your password and\nexpect to get access to that data.\n\n160\n00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.560\nSo either, a, remember your password,\n\n161\n00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.290\nb, let's break out a Time Machine\nbackup and restore your machine, or, c,\n\n162\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.260\nwe start to do password recovery.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n163\n00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.405\nis all that a difficult process?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n164\n00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:50.300\nremembering a password shouldn't\nbe a difficult process.\n\n165\n00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.850\nFor some people, it is.\n\n166\n00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.330\nTime Machine is not a difficult process,\nit's easy to restore Time Machine.\n\n167\n00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.464\nBut, you're gonna lose data, right?\n\n168\n00:07:57.464 --> 00:08:00.702\nHow much data have you had in your system\nsince the last Time Machine backup?\n\n169\n00:08:00.702 --> 00:08:03.338\nIf you've backed up recently,\nit's not a big deal.\n\n170\n00:08:03.338 --> 00:08:04.984\nYou just do it and that's it.\n\n171\n00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:08.670\nBut if you haven't backed up in days,\nthat could be really painful.\n\n172\n00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.750\nSo the last option is recovering,\nusing that recovery key.\n\n173\n00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.731\nNow in part one, we saw how to generate\nthat recovery key when we turned on\n\n174\n00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:18.223\nFileVault, but we didn't actually use it.\n\n175\n00:08:18.223 --> 00:08:21.077\nThe process to use it,\nreally not that hard.\n\n176\n00:08:21.077 --> 00:08:22.638\nWhat you do is your get\nto your login screen.\n\n177\n00:08:22.638 --> 00:08:24.466\nSo I'm back in my login screen here.\n\n178\n00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:28.170\nAnd let's say that I type in, I'm gonna\ntype in the wrong password, right?\n\n179\n00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:33.884\nSo I'll just hit some random keys and I\npress Enter, it tries it, I get an error.\n\n180\n00:08:33.884 --> 00:08:37.050\nNot really much here on the screen.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n181\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.618\n&gt;&gt; There's a little message\n\n182\n00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:42.828\nthat pops up here on the bottom,\nthat is very, very difficult to see.\n\n183\n00:08:42.828 --> 00:08:47.052\nBut it says, if you are having a problem\nentering your password press and\n\n184\n00:08:47.052 --> 00:08:49.832\nhold the power button on\nyou Mac to shut it down.\n\n185\n00:08:49.832 --> 00:08:54.035\nThen press it again to start\nup in recovery OS, okay?\n\n186\n00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:55.622\nThat's what it tells us.\n\n187\n00:08:55.622 --> 00:09:00.609\nNow, unfortunately these instructions\nare not really right, okay?\n\n188\n00:09:00.609 --> 00:09:04.005\nIf you boot to recovery right now,\nhow does that help you?\n\n189\n00:09:04.005 --> 00:09:05.054\nIt really doesn't.\n\n190\n00:09:05.054 --> 00:09:07.752\nIt gives you the ability to restore\na time machine is what it does.\n\n191\n00:09:07.752 --> 00:09:11.214\nSo if you wanna restore from time machine,\nfollow these instructions.\n\n192\n00:09:11.214 --> 00:09:15.788\nShut Down, boot back up by holding\nthe Cmd+ R, which actually it doesn't even\n\n193\n00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:19.288\ntell you to hold Cmd+R,\nit just says Startup and Recovery.\n\n194\n00:09:19.288 --> 00:09:22.425\nBut you boot up holding Cmd+R,\nyou go into Recovery and\n\n195\n00:09:22.425 --> 00:09:24.846\nyou restore time machine backup, right?\n\n196\n00:09:24.846 --> 00:09:28.062\nBut if I've got FileVault,\nand I have my Recovery key,\n\n197\n00:09:28.062 --> 00:09:29.985\nI wanna do something different.\n\n198\n00:09:29.985 --> 00:09:32.192\nSomething they're not telling\nme here on the screen.\n\n199\n00:09:32.192 --> 00:09:36.560\nWhen I typed in that password,\nit made the little arrow go away.\n\n200\n00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.045\nAnd if I delete my password out, see how\nit's telling me enter my password and\n\n201\n00:09:41.045 --> 00:09:43.815\nthen there's a question\nmark right beside it?\n\n202\n00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:46.717\nIf you click on that question mark,\nwhen you click on it,\n\n203\n00:09:46.717 --> 00:09:50.170\nit will actually, whoops,\nI'm trying really hard to click on it.\n\n204\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.011\nThere we go.\n\n205\n00:09:51.011 --> 00:09:52.514\nIt'll pop up a message.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:09:52.514 --> 00:09:53.495\n&gt;&gt; Apparently the hardest part is\n\n207\n00:09:53.495 --> 00:09:55.238\nclicking on the question mark.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n208\n00:09:55.238 --> 00:09:57.180\n&gt;&gt; It'll pop up a message, and it says,\n\n209\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.033\niIf you forgot your password,\nyou can dot, dot, dot,\n\n210\n00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:01.816\nreset it using your Recovery Key.\n\n211\n00:10:01.816 --> 00:10:03.392\nNow, why the dot, dot, dot?\n\n212\n00:10:03.392 --> 00:10:05.034\nWhy the dramatic pause?\n\n213\n00:10:05.034 --> 00:10:09.937\nBecause when I turn on FileVault,\nit asks me do I want the recovery key to\n\n214\n00:10:09.937 --> 00:10:14.376\nbe tied to my iCloud account or\ndo I wanna go standalone, right?\n\n215\n00:10:14.376 --> 00:10:17.250\nI chose standalone,\nI didn't wanna do an iCloud account.\n\n216\n00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.932\nIf you did an iCloud account,\n\n217\n00:10:18.932 --> 00:10:22.308\nit would say dot dot dot use\nyour iCloud account to recover.\n\n218\n00:10:22.308 --> 00:10:26.423\nAnd you could click this arrow, and\nit'll take you to where you can do that,\n\n219\n00:10:26.423 --> 00:10:29.255\nwhere you can login with\nyour iCloud credentials and\n\n220\n00:10:29.255 --> 00:10:32.428\nyou can recover your password and\nthen unlock the system.\n\n221\n00:10:32.428 --> 00:10:35.817\nBut if you did like me,\nI chose Recovery Key.\n\n222\n00:10:35.817 --> 00:10:38.687\nSo I'm going to click\nthe arrow beside that, and\n\n223\n00:10:38.687 --> 00:10:41.638\nnow it's gonna ask me to\npunch in my Recovery Key.\n\n224\n00:10:41.638 --> 00:10:44.683\nAnd so now I can break out my cell phone,\nwhich again-\n\n225\n00:10:44.683 --> 00:10:45.616\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n226\n00:10:45.616 --> 00:10:47.633\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily the greatest practice\n\n227\n00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:50.391\nto store your Recovery Key\nas a picture on your phone.\n\n228\n00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:54.460\nBut on a show like this it was quick and\neasy, so it suited my needs.\n\n229\n00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.815\nBut basically,\nI can go in here and pull that up.\n\n230\n00:10:58.815 --> 00:10:59.910\nI trying really hard.\n\n231\n00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.881\nI'm browsing the Internet on the show.\n\n232\n00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:03.770\nIt's my new thing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n233\n00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.155\n&gt;&gt; And I'm gonnapull up my picture of\n\n234\n00:11:06.155 --> 00:11:09.373\nthe Recovery Key which is almost,\nhere we go.\n\n235\n00:11:09.373 --> 00:11:11.804\nSo I've got my picture,\nI've got my Recovery Key.\n\n236\n00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:13.580\nThe hardest part here is\njust gonna be typing in.\n\n237\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.974\nSo I'm gonna punch in my\nkey as seen on the show.\n\n238\n00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:20.106\nAnd it's nice here,\nbecause it's not case sensitive,\n\n239\n00:11:20.106 --> 00:11:22.073\nit's all capital letters.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n240\n00:11:22.073 --> 00:11:25.609\n&gt;&gt; And Apple purposely avoids things like\n\n241\n00:11:25.609 --> 00:11:30.866\nthe 0 and O mix up, or\nthe captial I and lower case L mix up.\n\n242\n00:11:30.866 --> 00:11:35.378\nThey use a font that makes it easy to\ntell which each of these letters are.\n\n243\n00:11:35.378 --> 00:11:42.701\nSo I'm punching in that key,\nand as I do it.\n\n244\n00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:45.063\nAgain as along as I type it in correctly,\n\n245\n00:11:45.063 --> 00:11:48.686\nthis is the key that's going to\nallow it to recover my system.\n\n246\n00:11:48.686 --> 00:11:52.518\nNow I mentioned in part one that if\nsomebody got a hold of this key,\n\n247\n00:11:52.518 --> 00:11:55.388\nthey would be able to do this very thing,\nright?\n\n248\n00:11:55.388 --> 00:12:00.132\nAll they will have to do is type the wrong\npassword once, click the question mark.\n\n249\n00:12:00.132 --> 00:12:05.439\nAnd then come in here and type this key,\nand then we decrypt that disk, right?\n\n250\n00:12:05.439 --> 00:12:08.214\nWhile punching that key and\nI click the arrow,\n\n251\n00:12:08.214 --> 00:12:12.924\nits now got the information that it needs\nto be able to unlock that disk, okay?\n\n252\n00:12:12.924 --> 00:12:17.300\nNow this process can actually\ntake a little bit of time.\n\n253\n00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.285\nBecause it's having to go in and\ndecipher a couple of areas, but\n\n254\n00:12:20.285 --> 00:12:23.932\nthen it's gonna be able to take me into\nthe system, and I'll be able to reset my\n\n255\n00:12:23.932 --> 00:12:25.111\npassword from there.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n256\n00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:27.144\nDon, what happens after we enter that key?\n\n257\n00:12:27.144 --> 00:12:29.444\nIs there anything else we\nneed to do at that point?\n\n258\n00:12:29.444 --> 00:12:31.042\n&gt;&gt; So once you've punched in that key,\n\n259\n00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.546\ntechnically you're in, right?\n\n260\n00:12:32.546 --> 00:12:35.085\nYou now have access to your system.\n\n261\n00:12:35.085 --> 00:12:38.365\nYou kind of have a couple of\nchoices about what you wanna do.\n\n262\n00:12:38.365 --> 00:12:41.835\nThe normal thing to do, would be to go and\nreset your password, so\n\n263\n00:12:41.835 --> 00:12:43.804\nthat you know what your password is.\n\n264\n00:12:43.804 --> 00:12:47.591\nAnd so if you go into the user and groups\nsystem preference, you can go in and\n\n265\n00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:48.932\nreset your own password.\n\n266\n00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:52.796\nAnd once that's done, now you'll\nhave access to your drive again.\n\n267\n00:12:52.796 --> 00:12:55.400\nIf you don't do that the other\noption is you can always go in and\n\n268\n00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.663\nturn FileVault off, right?\n\n269\n00:12:56.663 --> 00:13:00.244\nThat doesn't fully help you,\ncause you still don't know your password.\n\n270\n00:13:00.244 --> 00:13:03.880\nBut at that point,\nyou could go into the recovery mode, and\n\n271\n00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.609\nin recovery mode you can reset\nuser passwords from in there.\n\n272\n00:13:07.609 --> 00:13:08.979\nSo there's a few different options.\n\n273\n00:13:08.979 --> 00:13:12.145\nBut the expectation is,\nyou login and reset your password.\n\n274\n00:13:12.145 --> 00:13:15.800\nYour new password will automatically\nbe added to the list of passwords that\n\n275\n00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.780\nare allowed to unlock that private key.\n\n276\n00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.673\nAnd then you'll be back in business,\n\n277\n00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:22.166\nit doesn't have to\nre-encrypt the whole drive.\n\n278\n00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:25.071\nWhen you punch in that Recovery Key it\ndoesn't actually even decrypt the drive.\n\n279\n00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:28.975\nIt's just allowing you access to the disk\ntemporarily until you can get a new\n\n280\n00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:31.301\npassword that allows\nyou to unlock that key.\n\n281\n00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:34.139\nSo you just go in that system\npreference then you'll be in business.\n\n282\n00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:34.818\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense,\n\n283\n00:13:34.818 --> 00:13:38.051\nwhat would we need to do if we're\ngonna give our Mac to someone else?\n\n284\n00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:39.821\nThey're gonna let them borrow it or\nwhatever.\n\n285\n00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:40.595\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n286\n00:13:40.595 --> 00:13:44.242\nso let's say, I've got my Mac,\nand I'm done with it.\n\n287\n00:13:44.242 --> 00:13:48.132\nI got a new one, and\nI'm ready to move off of this one.\n\n288\n00:13:48.132 --> 00:13:51.808\nI've got FileVault on here,\nmy data's encrypted.\n\n289\n00:13:51.808 --> 00:13:55.988\nSo if I give this laptop to somebody else,\ncan they get at my data?\n\n290\n00:13:55.988 --> 00:13:59.365\nNo, I mean, if I share my password\nwith them, but that's my own fault.\n\n291\n00:13:59.365 --> 00:14:02.184\nSo if I don't tell them my password,\nthey can't get at my data,\n\n292\n00:14:02.184 --> 00:14:03.658\nthey also can't use the system.\n\n293\n00:14:03.658 --> 00:14:07.237\nSo they would have to do something\nlike booting into recovery and\n\n294\n00:14:07.237 --> 00:14:08.572\nthen reinstall Mac OS.\n\n295\n00:14:08.572 --> 00:14:12.601\nAnd now they've got a fresh install of\nMac OS, and my data was completely safe,\n\n296\n00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:15.403\nI don't have to worry about it.\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n297\n00:14:15.403 --> 00:14:18.123\n&gt;&gt; But, if I wasn't using FileVault,\n\n298\n00:14:18.123 --> 00:14:23.315\nthen I do have a bit a problem here,\nbecause they could access my data.\n\n299\n00:14:23.315 --> 00:14:26.895\nWe talked about that in the beginning of\npart one about if somebody has physical\n\n300\n00:14:26.895 --> 00:14:29.075\naccess to your system,\nthey can get your data.\n\n301\n00:14:29.075 --> 00:14:32.322\nAnd even if it's somebody that\nyou know like a friend or family.\n\n302\n00:14:32.322 --> 00:14:35.732\nAnd you are not worried about your data\nsafety, you don't know who they are or\n\n303\n00:14:35.732 --> 00:14:37.798\nwhen they get the device\nto when they are done.\n\n304\n00:14:37.798 --> 00:14:41.105\nAnd your data does stay around,\nhangs around on the disk.\n\n305\n00:14:41.105 --> 00:14:44.123\nEven after you delete it, right?\n\n306\n00:14:44.123 --> 00:14:49.160\nSo if you've ever read about what\nthe FBI does when they analyze systems.\n\n307\n00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.948\nThey do forensic analysis right on\nthe hard drives on the spinning disks for\n\n308\n00:14:53.948 --> 00:14:57.976\nthe older style drives,\nsnd even on the circuitry in the SSDs.\n\n309\n00:14:57.976 --> 00:15:02.246\nAnd they're able to recover data\neven after it's been deleted.\n\n310\n00:15:02.246 --> 00:15:04.082\nWhen you delete a file\noff your hard drive,\n\n311\n00:15:04.082 --> 00:15:06.022\nit doesn't actually delete the whole file.\n\n312\n00:15:06.022 --> 00:15:08.842\nIt deletes the header that\nsays the file exists.\n\n313\n00:15:08.842 --> 00:15:15.107\nThe data's still there and the data stays\nthere until something else overwrites it.\n\n314\n00:15:15.107 --> 00:15:18.824\nWell, if you haven't done anything\nspecial on your system, you shut it down,\n\n315\n00:15:18.824 --> 00:15:20.718\nyou delete everything, you shutdown.\n\n316\n00:15:20.718 --> 00:15:23.343\nTechnically all your data is still\nthere and it's fully intact.\n\n317\n00:15:23.343 --> 00:15:25.310\nIt's just kind of hidden away.\n\n318\n00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.432\nAnd forensic analysis tools\nallow them to recover that data.\n\n319\n00:15:28.432 --> 00:15:32.647\nNow I don't worry about it as far\nas like the law enforcement side.\n\n320\n00:15:32.647 --> 00:15:34.598\nThat if they've got a subpoena for\nmy laptop-\n\n321\n00:15:34.598 --> 00:15:35.349\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:15:35.349 --> 00:15:36.532\n&gt;&gt; And I've got bigger issues to\n\n323\n00:15:36.532 --> 00:15:38.503\nworry about.\n&gt;&gt; That's very good, Don.\n\n324\n00:15:38.503 --> 00:15:42.110\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But what I do worry about is malicious\n\n325\n00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.926\nactors getting ahold of that data.\n&gt;&gt; Bad actors.\n\n326\n00:15:45.926 --> 00:15:48.010\n&gt;&gt; If my laptop gets stolen,\n\n327\n00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.718\nif I sell my laptop on\neBay to a total stranger.\n\n328\n00:15:51.718 --> 00:15:55.419\nAnd they go in there and they run some of\nthese forensic tools against the disk,\n\n329\n00:15:55.419 --> 00:15:56.498\nthey're available.\n\n330\n00:15:56.498 --> 00:16:00.337\nAnybody can get a whole of these tools,\nit's not just for the FBI, that they can\n\n331\n00:16:00.337 --> 00:16:03.674\nrun the analysis on there and\nthey can find all sorts of information.\n\n332\n00:16:03.674 --> 00:16:06.902\nMaybe my tax returns,\nwhich I'm really good,\n\n333\n00:16:06.902 --> 00:16:12.870\nI'm not putting my tax returns online, but\nI do have them on my computer at home.\n\n334\n00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.410\nAnd so if somebody got a hold of that,\n\n335\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.280\nthere's not much you can do\nwith somebody's tax data.\n\n336\n00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.180\nBut it does have my name, address,\nSocial Security number, birth date.\n\n337\n00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.300\nAll of that,\nright there on the tax returns.\n\n338\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.370\nThat's enough information to open up\na line of credit, get a cellphone,\n\n339\n00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:28.430\nthat kinda stuff.\n\n340\n00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.432\nAnd you don't want that to happen.\n\n341\n00:16:30.432 --> 00:16:31.820\nYou wanna make sure that\nthe only people who have\n\n342\n00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.250\naccess to your data are the people\nyou intend to have access to it.\n\n343\n00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.190\nThe best way to ensure that is firewall.\n\n344\n00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.010\nCuz firewall encrypts everything.\n\n345\n00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.520\nSo if they run forensics tools and\nthey recover your data, what do they get?\n\n346\n00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.430\nThey recover encrypted data.\n\n347\n00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.770\nIt's still encrypted.\n\n348\n00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:51.542\nThey can't break it without hundreds of\nyears of computing power to be able to get\n\n349\n00:16:51.542 --> 00:16:54.002\nin there and decrypt it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n350\n00:16:54.002 --> 00:16:55.880\n&gt;&gt; So the data is really, really safe.\n\n351\n00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.251\nWithout firewall though,\n\n352\n00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:00.340\nyou might be in trouble.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n353\n00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.758\n&gt;&gt; So here's how we can get around that.\n\n354\n00:17:02.758 --> 00:17:05.460\nIf you're gonna be giving\nyour system to somebody else,\n\n355\n00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.850\nthe best thing to do is to ensure\nthat the disk is actually erased.\n\n356\n00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.090\nThat it's actually clean.\n\n357\n00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:13.600\nNow, if you're doing your main system,\n\n358\n00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.170\nwhat I recommend you do is you make\na bootable USB installation media.\n\n359\n00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.340\nLike we did way back in episode\nnumber one of this series.\n\n360\n00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.290\nYou boot off of that media and\n\n361\n00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.880\nyou can use disk utility to then go in and\ndo what's called a secure\n\n362\n00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.670\nerase of your operating system disk.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n363\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:32.160\n&gt;&gt; You have to do it from a removable\n\n364\n00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.660\nmedia because you can't do a secure\nerase of a disk if you're actually\n\n365\n00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.360\nusing the disk at that time.\n\n366\n00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.190\nSo for example, my laptop I'm booted\nright now, so Macintosh HD is use.\n\n367\n00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:45.210\nIf I'm try and erase it,\nit's gonna be pretty unhappy about that.\n\n368\n00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.160\nBut if I have other media, I can erase\nthat easily while I'm writing here.\n\n369\n00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.410\nSo I'm gonna show you\nan example here with this.\n\n370\n00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:54.850\nSo I've got a USB hard drive.\n\n371\n00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:57.160\nThis is one that I,\nactually this is brand new.\n\n372\n00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.340\nI haven't used it for anything.\n\n373\n00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:03.070\nBut I usually use these for time\nmachine back ups and I'm gonna take in,\n\n374\n00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:08.180\nI've got my USB-C adapter here so\nI can plug it into my laptop.\n\n375\n00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.920\nAnd let's say I've been using this for\ntime machine and\n\n376\n00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.410\nthat I've got a years worth\nof backups right here,\n\n377\n00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:19.390\nif somebody gets a hold of this, they've\ngot my backups, they've got all my data.\n\n378\n00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:23.930\nHopefully I encrypted it but\nif I didn't encrypt it, I can still\n\n379\n00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.860\ndo a secure race to make it safe to\nbe able to hand off to someone else.\n\n380\n00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.240\nSo I'm gonna plug this in to my system,\nmy system picks up that drug pretty quick,\n\n381\n00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.480\nI can see I've got this WD\nelements turning up here.\n\n382\n00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.565\nSo that's that part of\nWestern Digital Elements.\n\n383\n00:18:36.565 --> 00:18:41.228\nAnd if I go into my disk utility,\nI can find out what that's formatted so\n\n384\n00:18:41.228 --> 00:18:45.056\nI see my Macintosh HD,\nthat's my built-in system disk.\n\n385\n00:18:45.056 --> 00:18:49.080\nSo it's APFS, it's a 500 GB SSD.\n\n386\n00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.410\nAnd then I see that\nWestern Digital Elements sitting there,\n\n387\n00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.100\nit's actually formatted XFAT.\n\n388\n00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.000\nSo it's a brand new disk,\nI haven't used it and Western Digital,\n\n389\n00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.530\nthey formatted it to try and be generic.\n\n390\n00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.650\nThis file system works on Windows and\nMacs so that makes sense.\n\n391\n00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:04.230\nBut let's say that I've had this disk and\nI've been using it for time machine.\n\n392\n00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:08.052\nWell, first off,\nwith time machine I wouldn't use XFAT,\n\n393\n00:19:08.052 --> 00:19:10.964\nI would use at least MAC OS 610 did or\nAPFS.\n\n394\n00:19:10.964 --> 00:19:15.902\nBut if I've got backup data on here, I\nneed to make sure that, when I format this\n\n395\n00:19:15.902 --> 00:19:20.276\ndisk to be able to give it to somebody\nelse, that all that data is gone.\n\n396\n00:19:20.276 --> 00:19:22.930\nThat it's securely erased.\n\n397\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:27.200\nNow, if I just hit Erase, I can pick\na file system and give it a name.\n\n398\n00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.804\nSo maybe I'll make it MAC OS Extended\nJournal or APFS, either one.\n\n399\n00:19:31.804 --> 00:19:34.350\nI'll do APFS.\n\n400\n00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:38.480\nAnd when I give it that name,\nI'm gonna call this one Time Machine,\n\n401\n00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.410\nthat's what I was using it for,\nI'm gonna give it to somebody else.\n\n402\n00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:47.120\nWhen I hit Erase, it's not\ntechnically going to delete the data,\n\n403\n00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.082\nit's just deleting the headers,\nthe file table where it's actually\n\n404\n00:19:52.082 --> 00:19:55.400\npointing out to where all\nthis file data is stored.\n\n405\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.340\nSo that's not truly secure.\n\n406\n00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:03.620\nBut if we go into Security Options right\nhere, I'll see where I've got a slider.\n\n407\n00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.920\nAnd right now it's set to the fastest.\n\n408\n00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:12.350\nAnd it even tells me, this option does\nnot securely erase the files on the disc.\n\n409\n00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.740\nA disc recovery application may\nbe able to recover the files.\n\n410\n00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.390\nIt's warning me right here, sort of,\n[LAUGH] sort of right here,\n\n411\n00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.960\nbecause right back on this screen,\nit didn't warn me at all, like, yeah,\n\n412\n00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:27.080\nwe're gonna delete all data stored\non it and it cannot be undone.\n\n413\n00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.720\nThat makes me think, hey, this is secure,\nthis can't be undone, nobody can get it,\n\n414\n00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.950\nmy data is safe.\n\n415\n00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.420\nLet's send it off.\n\n416\n00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.670\nThat's not true.\n\n417\n00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.120\nIt can be undone.\n\n418\n00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.120\nIt can't 100% be undone, that's really\nwhat they're trying to say there.\n\n419\n00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.990\nBut it can be undone to a pretty\nlarge degree with forensic software.\n\n420\n00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.710\nSo when you go into Security Options,\nthey're acknowledging that, and\n\n421\n00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.990\nsaying, yeah, actually there's tools\nthat can get us some of this data.\n\n422\n00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:55.670\nSo if we wanna prevent that,\nwe can slide this over and\n\n423\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:21:00.420\nwe've actually got three different choices\nhere over how we wanna securely erase and\n\n424\n00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.420\nthe first one says,\nhere's what we're gonna do,\n\n425\n00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.050\ninstead of just deleting the headers,\nwe're gonna through, and\n\n426\n00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:11.270\nwe're gonna write random\ndata across the entire disk.\n\n427\n00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.840\nWhen data's stored on a disk,\nit's stored as either a 0 or 1, so\n\n428\n00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.420\nit's gonna write random 0s and\n1s across the entire disk.\n\n429\n00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.460\nWell, I keep saying\nacross the entire disk.\n\n430\n00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.680\nIt's gonna write that over areas\nwhere you actually have data, and\n\n431\n00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:30.960\nthen it goes through and it does a single\npass of 0s over the entire disk.\n\n432\n00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.990\nSo now it takes every available block and\nwrites a 0 to it.\n\n433\n00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.560\nSo now, if somebody ran forensic software,\nwhat would they find?\n\n434\n00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.965\nIt would just find zeroes.\n\n435\n00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:40.840\nAnd that's fine.\n\n436\n00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.000\nIt's not my data, my data stays safe.\n\n437\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.390\nI can give this disk to a friend,\nto family,\n\n438\n00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:49.920\nI can sell it on eBay to a total\nstranger and know my data is safe.\n\n439\n00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.400\nWell, to a degree.\n\n440\n00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.380\nIf you think about it, well,\nactually they say it right here.\n\n441\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.480\nIt erases the information used\nto access your files, and\n\n442\n00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.530\nwrites over the data two times.\n\n443\n00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:03.138\nIt writes random data first,\nand then it writes zeroes.\n\n444\n00:22:03.138 --> 00:22:05.239\nSo it's overwriting your data twice.\n\n445\n00:22:05.239 --> 00:22:09.137\nIf it's just a random\nstranger on the Internet,\n\n446\n00:22:09.137 --> 00:22:14.940\nthen you're probably fine, but\nif it's a government agency.\n\n447\n00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.760\nLet's say that you are a,\nlet's have some fun here,\n\n448\n00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.650\nyou're 007, you work for MI6.\n&gt;&gt; MI6.\n\n449\n00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.225\n&gt;&gt; MI6, thank you.\n\n450\n00:22:25.225 --> 00:22:30.920\n[LAUGH] And you have the queen zone\ndata right here on your laptop.\n\n451\n00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:36.043\nAnd you've been captured by\nevil darker [INAUDIBLE] or\n\n452\n00:22:36.043 --> 00:22:36.671\nsomething.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n453\n00:22:36.671 --> 00:22:37.815\n&gt;&gt; And you don't want them to\n\n454\n00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:38.620\nget the data.\n\n455\n00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.940\nWell, the really,\nreally sophisticated state run agencies,\n\n456\n00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.910\nthey have access to hardware\nthat we can't even dream of, and\n\n457\n00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.950\nthey're actually able to recover data even\nif it's been overwritten once or twice.\n\n458\n00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:54.130\nThat especially on spinning disks, those\nmagnetic signatures, they hang around for\n\n459\n00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.390\na little while and\nthey can potentially get at that data.\n\n460\n00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:03.620\nSo if you are on a US SEAL team or\nyou're working for MI6 or whatever,\n\n461\n00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.520\nfirst off you've got a cool job, secondly-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n462\n00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.650\n&gt;&gt; We can go a little bit higher, and\n\n463\n00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.530\nthe next two steps up address that.\n\n464\n00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:14.180\nSo if I slide that slight over\none more bump, I'm gonna see or\n\n465\n00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:15.770\nmy description here changes.\n\n466\n00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.970\nSo back here, it said it was just\ngonna override the data two times,\n\n467\n00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:24.500\nnow it tells me we're gonna do a DOE\ncompliant three pass security.\n\n468\n00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.130\nSo now it does two passes of random data.\n\n469\n00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.510\nAnd one pass of all zeroes.\n\n470\n00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:37.190\nBut if I go all the way to the right,\nhere's the US Department of Defense,\n\n471\n00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:42.090\nDOD, 5220-22-M standard for\nsecure erase of magnetic media.\n\n472\n00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.970\nErases the information used\nto access your files and\n\n473\n00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:47.850\nwrites over the data seven times.\n&gt;&gt; Gosh.\n\n474\n00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.815\n&gt;&gt; Seven times of writing random data.\n\n475\n00:23:49.815 --> 00:23:53.489\nAnd at that point, it's good enough for\nthe US Department of Defense that your\n\n476\n00:23:53.489 --> 00:23:57.236\ndata is effectively destroyed, and\nyou're able to redistribute this media.\n\n477\n00:23:57.236 --> 00:24:01.065\nNow, notice it says, for\nsecurely erasing magnetic media.\n\n478\n00:24:01.065 --> 00:24:03.775\nIt doesn't specifically call it SSD,\nright.\n\n479\n00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:07.010\nSSD stores data a different\nway than magnetic media.\n\n480\n00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:12.955\nAnd it's very difficult to recover SSD\ndeleted data after even one or two passes.\n\n481\n00:24:12.955 --> 00:24:16.450\nSo even though the lower level\nhere would be fine on an SSD, but\n\n482\n00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.758\nthis higher level is really\nimportant on a spinning disk.\n\n483\n00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:24.554\nNow, this secure erase allows\nme to wipe this disc and\n\n484\n00:24:24.554 --> 00:24:28.292\nensure that nobody can recover the data.\n\n485\n00:24:28.292 --> 00:24:31.829\nBut you know the best way to ensure\nnobody can recover the data,\n\n486\n00:24:31.829 --> 00:24:33.249\ndestroy the hard drive.\n\n487\n00:24:33.249 --> 00:24:36.050\nAnd if those you out there\nwho actually do work for MI6,\n\n488\n00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.624\nyou were probably thinking\nthis a few moments ago.\n\n489\n00:24:38.624 --> 00:24:42.247\nWell, Don, we don't do this, we just\ndestroy the disc, absolutely, right.\n\n490\n00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:45.742\nBut for a regular home user\nhard drives cost money.\n\n491\n00:24:45.742 --> 00:24:48.560\nAnd if I wanna give this\ncomputer to a friend or family,\n\n492\n00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.723\nI just wanna know that my data is removed.\n\n493\n00:24:50.723 --> 00:24:53.881\nAnd so these options right\nhere help us to ensure that.\n\n494\n00:24:53.881 --> 00:25:00.233\nNow, understand that the bigger your disk\nis, the longer this is going to take.\n\n495\n00:25:00.233 --> 00:25:02.994\nIf it has to write random\ndata across every sector and\n\n496\n00:25:02.994 --> 00:25:05.574\nthen it's got to write\n0s across every sector.\n\n497\n00:25:05.574 --> 00:25:08.567\nIf it's a 500 gig drive,\nit's gonna take a certain amount of time.\n\n498\n00:25:08.567 --> 00:25:11.055\nIf you do a terabyte drive,\nit'll do it twice as long,\n\n499\n00:25:11.055 --> 00:25:12.364\ntwice as much data to write.\n\n500\n00:25:12.364 --> 00:25:15.394\nIf it's an internal disk,\nit'll happen pretty fast.\n\n501\n00:25:15.394 --> 00:25:19.678\nIf it's an external disk like mine,\nit'll take longer, all right?\n\n502\n00:25:19.678 --> 00:25:22.982\nMy external hard drive\nis connected via USB3,\n\n503\n00:25:22.982 --> 00:25:25.796\nit's capped at 5 gigabits per second.\n\n504\n00:25:25.796 --> 00:25:30.700\nSo if I've got a terabyte drive\nwhich I do, at 5 gigabits per second\n\n505\n00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:35.271\nit's gonna take a good bit of\ntime to do these multiple passes.\n\n506\n00:25:35.271 --> 00:25:40.195\nIf I was on Thunderbolt it could be\nat 40 gigabit, that'd be way faster.\n\n507\n00:25:40.195 --> 00:25:44.502\nIf I was at regular USB3.0,\nit might even be lower.\n\n508\n00:25:44.502 --> 00:25:47.749\nI got all those things impact\nhow long this is gonna take but\n\n509\n00:25:47.749 --> 00:25:48.948\nthis can take hours.\n\n510\n00:25:48.948 --> 00:25:52.354\nIf you go all the way to the right and\ndo the full DOD one,\n\n511\n00:25:52.354 --> 00:25:54.591\nit can take days to write that data.\n\n512\n00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:58.492\nAnd that's why organizations will usually\njust destroy the disks, it's faster.\n\n513\n00:25:58.492 --> 00:26:03.223\nBut if you wanna make sure that your\ndata is safe at a minimum you wanna\n\n514\n00:26:03.223 --> 00:26:05.806\nchoose that first slider and hit OK.\n\n515\n00:26:05.806 --> 00:26:08.282\nAnd now when it goes to erase this disk,\n\n516\n00:26:08.282 --> 00:26:11.600\nit's going to ensure that\nit gets erased securely.\n\n517\n00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.046\nAnd a normal erase happens\nalmost instantly, right?\n\n518\n00:26:16.046 --> 00:26:19.860\nIt deletes the file tables,\nrebuilds the file tables and\n\n519\n00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.327\nit's done ,it would be done by now.\n\n520\n00:26:22.327 --> 00:26:26.461\nThis one, it's still sending starting\nto secure, isn't actually started yet.\n\n521\n00:26:26.461 --> 00:26:27.659\nAnd then in a moment,\n\n522\n00:26:27.659 --> 00:26:31.464\nwe're gonna start to see the tiniest\nlittle bit of this bar fill up.\n\n523\n00:26:31.464 --> 00:26:36.012\nAnd it's gonna slowly go\nacross over the next probably,\n\n524\n00:26:36.012 --> 00:26:40.287\ntwo or three hours,\nas it securely erases this disk.\n\n525\n00:26:40.287 --> 00:26:43.527\nAnd gets it to where it's safe to be,\nready to redistribute.\n\n526\n00:26:43.527 --> 00:26:46.131\nSo if you're gonna be passing\non hardware or disk or\n\n527\n00:26:46.131 --> 00:26:50.248\nwhatever outside of your company,\noutside of your home, your own possession,\n\n528\n00:26:50.248 --> 00:26:52.505\nthis is certainly a good\nidea to protect it.\n\n529\n00:26:52.505 --> 00:26:56.964\nIf you've already got File Vault turned\non, you can do the simple erase.\n\n530\n00:26:56.964 --> 00:26:59.116\nBecause even if someone\nruns forensic software,\n\n531\n00:26:59.116 --> 00:27:01.073\nthey're just gonna get the encrypted data.\n\n532\n00:27:01.073 --> 00:27:04.727\nSo another reason why you should\njust run fire vault on your systems,\n\n533\n00:27:04.727 --> 00:27:06.240\neven your removable disks.\n\n534\n00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.525\nEncrypt that data and then you don't have\nto worry about things like security risks.\n\n535\n00:27:09.525 --> 00:27:12.597\n&gt;&gt; Don, isn't there also a secure trash\n\n536\n00:27:12.597 --> 00:27:14.685\nfeature?\n&gt;&gt; So there used to be,\n\n537\n00:27:14.685 --> 00:27:19.151\nand I'm glad that you brought it up\nbecause a lot of people relied on this,\n\n538\n00:27:19.151 --> 00:27:22.046\nthat if I have a file or\na document or something.\n\n539\n00:27:22.046 --> 00:27:26.794\nAnd it's sitting on my desktop and\nI come in and I delete it.\n\n540\n00:27:26.794 --> 00:27:28.629\nSo I'm just gonna delete that little item,\nright.\n\n541\n00:27:28.629 --> 00:27:32.495\nWhen you delete something\nit goes into your trash.\n\n542\n00:27:32.495 --> 00:27:36.083\nAnd in your trash it sits there and\nyou can recover it.\n\n543\n00:27:36.083 --> 00:27:38.625\nSo we know it's not actually\ndeleted because its there.\n\n544\n00:27:38.625 --> 00:27:39.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n545\n00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.779\n&gt;&gt; But if you erase your trash,\n\n546\n00:27:40.779 --> 00:27:42.712\nmy head might cover some of this up.\n\n547\n00:27:42.712 --> 00:27:47.773\nWhen you go to erase your trash, I see a\nlittle menu item here, if I control click\n\n548\n00:27:47.773 --> 00:27:52.778\nor two finger click is what I did, or\nright click if you have a Microsoft mouse.\n\n549\n00:27:52.778 --> 00:27:57.842\nYou can just open and repeat trash, if I\nempty it everything goes away, all right.\n\n550\n00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:59.778\nBut it's not actually gone,\n\n551\n00:27:59.778 --> 00:28:03.961\nit just like the whole secure erase\nthing that when it goes away,\n\n552\n00:28:03.961 --> 00:28:08.770\nit can still be recovered undeleted\nsoftware or file forensics can do it.\n\n553\n00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:12.552\nYou used to be able to hold the option\nkey, which you guys can't see me but\n\n554\n00:28:12.552 --> 00:28:14.482\nI'm pushing the option key button.\n\n555\n00:28:14.482 --> 00:28:17.026\nYou used to be able to hit\nthe option key button and\n\n556\n00:28:17.026 --> 00:28:20.577\nanother option would show up here for\na secure empty trash, right.\n\n557\n00:28:20.577 --> 00:28:25.243\nThe same thing, if you looked under your\nApple menu, it used to be that you had it\n\n558\n00:28:25.243 --> 00:28:28.460\nup here as well,\nthat you would see this secure trash.\n\n559\n00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.796\nAnd when I hold Alt, actually I\nguess you can see when I hit option,\n\n560\n00:28:31.796 --> 00:28:34.056\nhow those things are changing.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n561\n00:28:34.056 --> 00:28:36.036\n&gt;&gt; So about this Mac becomes system\n\n562\n00:28:36.036 --> 00:28:40.813\ninformation but I don't even see the\nsecure trash or empty trash here at all.\n\n563\n00:28:40.813 --> 00:28:42.137\nSo that change,\n\n564\n00:28:42.137 --> 00:28:47.442\nit was a couple of versions ago\nthat they eliminated that feature.\n\n565\n00:28:47.442 --> 00:28:50.534\nAnd the reason they eliminated\nthe feature is they said we know\n\n566\n00:28:50.534 --> 00:28:51.727\na lot of people used it.\n\n567\n00:28:51.727 --> 00:28:55.733\nBut if you're using File Vault you\ndon't need to securely empty the trash,\n\n568\n00:28:55.733 --> 00:28:57.869\nthat data already can't be recovered.\n\n569\n00:28:57.869 --> 00:29:01.496\nSo because there's another feature\nthat directly replaces that,\n\n570\n00:29:01.496 --> 00:29:03.094\nthey eliminated the old one.\n\n571\n00:29:03.094 --> 00:29:05.764\nSo if that's part of your work flow\nknow that you just need to move over to\n\n572\n00:29:05.764 --> 00:29:08.086\nFile Vault and then you don't\nhave to worry about it anymore.\n\n573\n00:29:08.086 --> 00:29:12.325\nA regular empty trash is just as effective\nas a secure empty trash when you've got\n\n574\n00:29:12.325 --> 00:29:13.520\nFile Vault turned on.\n\n575\n00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.086\nAnd actually,\ngoing back to my secure erase, I can see,\n\n576\n00:29:17.086 --> 00:29:18.409\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n577\n00:29:18.409 --> 00:29:19.420\n&gt;&gt; There's got the first little bit\n\n578\n00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.186\n&gt;&gt; It's started.\n\n579\n00:29:20.186 --> 00:29:21.505\n&gt;&gt; It's not even five percent of\n\n580\n00:29:21.505 --> 00:29:24.932\nthe operation, so it kind of gives you\nguys an idea of how long it's gonna take\n\n581\n00:29:24.932 --> 00:29:27.163\nto run this process.\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n582\n00:29:27.163 --> 00:29:31.193\nWell, securing data part two,\nmake sure you see securing data part one,\n\n583\n00:29:31.193 --> 00:29:34.322\nimportant stuff, and\nDon's done a great job with that.\n\n584\n00:29:34.322 --> 00:29:36.591\nAnything else you'd like\nto add before we move on?\n\n585\n00:29:36.591 --> 00:29:38.241\n&gt;&gt; We didn't see encrypting\n\n586\n00:29:38.241 --> 00:29:42.373\nremovable media, we're gonna do\nthat episode on Time Machine.\n\n587\n00:29:42.373 --> 00:29:44.474\nAnd when we do Time Machine backups,\nit's so\n\n588\n00:29:44.474 --> 00:29:46.864\nimportant to protect\nthe data on removable media.\n\n589\n00:29:46.864 --> 00:29:50.589\nSo in that episode we'll show how\nto encrypt the Time Machine backup,\n\n590\n00:29:50.589 --> 00:29:52.496\nthat's a really important thing.\n\n591\n00:29:52.496 --> 00:29:55.250\nSo check that one out if you want to know\na little bit more about the removable\n\n592\n00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:55.874\nsort of things.\n\n593\n00:29:55.874 --> 00:29:59.921\nWhat you saw here is really all that\napplies to our internal disks and\n\n594\n00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:01.633\neven to the removal as well.\n\n595\n00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:05.638\nBut definitely check out the Time Machine\nepisode, we'll cover more security there.\n\n596\n00:30:05.638 --> 00:30:07.078\n&gt;&gt; Awesome job, Don.\n\n597\n00:30:07.078 --> 00:30:10.525\nAnd Apple Certified Support Professional\nis a fantastic series.\n\n598\n00:30:10.525 --> 00:30:12.802\nMake sure you see each and every episode.\n\n599\n00:30:12.802 --> 00:30:14.949\nSee them several times, it's good for you.\n\n600\n00:30:14.949 --> 00:30:18.445\nAnd [LAUGH] here inside the course\nlibrary, there's thousands of other\n\n601\n00:30:18.445 --> 00:30:21.950\nvideos and they're all designed to\ndo one thing, help you go further.\n\n602\n00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.377\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n603\n00:30:24.377 --> 00:30:28.138\nITProTV is binge worthy, thanks for\nwatching, I'm Zach

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:14.607\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.607 --> 00:00:16.733\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:20.643\nI'm your host Zach Memos for this episode\nof Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n8\n00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:26.376\nIn this episode, it's file permissions and\nlet's say this, very important.\n\n9\n00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:30.161\nThis is part one,\nthere's gonna part one, two, and three.\n\n10\n00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:33.683\nSo there'll be three episodes\naltogether for file permissions, but\n\n11\n00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:34.585\nthis is part one.\n\n12\n00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:36.210\nDon Pezet is here to show us the way.\n\n13\n00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.371\nDon, good to see you, sir.\n\n14\n00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:38.404\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Zach.\n\n15\n00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:42.070\nAnd you might be wondering why\nwe're about to have this three part\n\n16\n00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.081\nodyssey on something as\nsimple as file permissions.\n\n17\n00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:46.382\nPermissions are really important.\n\n18\n00:00:46.382 --> 00:00:48.938\nAnd as we go through this whole series,\n\n19\n00:00:48.938 --> 00:00:53.047\nkinda this recurring theme we have\nis Apple stuff is easy to do.\n\n20\n00:00:53.047 --> 00:00:55.176\nBut sometimes things go wrong and\nwe have to troubleshoot.\n\n21\n00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:57.003\nWe have to figure out\nwhy someone didn't work.\n\n22\n00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:58.291\nWe have to make it work.\n\n23\n00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:03.063\nAnd a lot of times our problems\nget tied back to permissions.\n\n24\n00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.122\nSo as a support professional,\nit's really important that you have\n\n25\n00:01:06.122 --> 00:01:09.085\na good understanding of how\nthe permissions work, what they do.\n\n26\n00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:12.445\nHow they do the things they do,\nhow to recognize when they're broken.\n\n27\n00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:16.680\nAnd a lot of that is stuff we're gonna\nsee right here in this episode, or\n\n28\n00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.739\nin this little three part series.\n\n29\n00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:20.529\nAnd some of it will also cover, again,\n\n30\n00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:22.826\nwe get into the full on\ntroubleshooting episode.\n\n31\n00:01:22.826 --> 00:01:23.528\nBut we wanna make sure\n\n32\n00:01:23.528 --> 00:01:25.638\nthat you've got a really good\nunderstanding of how these work.\n\n33\n00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:28.831\nAnd that will help you when you're\nout there troubleshooting and\n\n34\n00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:29.828\nsupporting Mac OS.\n\n35\n00:01:29.828 --> 00:01:34.043\n&gt;&gt; So a good way to begin is how\nare file permissions used by Mac OS?\n\n36\n00:01:34.043 --> 00:01:35.613\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the main way,\n\n37\n00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:39.875\nthe primary way these permissions are used\nis to isolate data between users.\n\n38\n00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:43.962\nSo if I have documents and\nZach has documents, they're separate.\n\n39\n00:01:43.962 --> 00:01:45.250\nI can't get to his documents.\n\n40\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.458\nHe can't get to my documents.\n\n41\n00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:48.049\nThey're stored on the same hard drive.\n\n42\n00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.623\nThey're stored in the same file system,\nbut we're separated, right?\n\n43\n00:01:52.623 --> 00:01:55.683\nBut they're also used to do other things\nlike protect operating system files so\n\n44\n00:01:55.683 --> 00:01:56.971\nthat we can't tamper with them.\n\n45\n00:01:56.971 --> 00:02:00.594\nProtect applications,\nto isolate our sandbox applications so\n\n46\n00:02:00.594 --> 00:02:03.216\nthat they can't access other applications.\n\n47\n00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:07.337\nThat minimize malware, viruses,\ntrojans, things like that.\n\n48\n00:02:07.337 --> 00:02:11.940\nBut at the end of the day for a user,\nthey're typically just used to protect\n\n49\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.392\nfiles, folders, and\nother shared network services.\n\n50\n00:02:15.392 --> 00:02:18.249\nThings like shared printers and\ndevices like that.\n\n51\n00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:22.335\nSo it's all about isolation,\nand I shouldn't say isolation.\n\n52\n00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:26.395\nI should say it's about ensuring that only\n\n53\n00:02:26.395 --> 00:02:30.350\nthe people I want to\ncan get at a resource.\n\n54\n00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.976\nThat resource might be isolated to just me\nor it might be shared across five people.\n\n55\n00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:36.751\nBut those are the only five\npeople I want to get to it.\n\n56\n00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:39.874\nAnd that's what I can do if file\npermissions are configured properly.\n\n57\n00:02:39.874 --> 00:02:41.952\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, well how are they assigned?\n\n58\n00:02:41.952 --> 00:02:43.787\n&gt;&gt; Well,\na lot of them are automatic, right?\n\n59\n00:02:43.787 --> 00:02:47.935\nSo the operating system has a ton of\ndefault permissions that are in place.\n\n60\n00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:52.120\nSo when you went to the old Mac OS,\nit's copying files to the hard drive.\n\n61\n00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.038\nAnd it's dropping them\ninto various folders.\n\n62\n00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:58.171\nAnd when it does that, there's permissions\nthat are put in place by default.\n\n63\n00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:01.921\nAnd they're dictating who's\nallowed to access what.\n\n64\n00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:07.328\nNow, the who part is a little\nbit kind of counterintuitive.\n\n65\n00:03:07.328 --> 00:03:10.799\nAnd that's because we have to\nremember that when we run Mac OS,\n\n66\n00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.364\nwe see this pretty\ngraphical user interface.\n\n67\n00:03:13.364 --> 00:03:16.796\nBut under the hood, it's BSD Unix.\n\n68\n00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:23.178\nAnd so any of the security features in MAC\nOS usually start from the BSD Unix side.\n\n69\n00:03:23.178 --> 00:03:24.548\nPermissions are not an exception.\n\n70\n00:03:24.548 --> 00:03:28.388\nSo the permissions are being set in\nthe background in a very difficult,\n\n71\n00:03:28.388 --> 00:03:29.415\nunintuitive way.\n\n72\n00:03:29.415 --> 00:03:33.507\nAnd we'll see a little bit later how\nthere is an easier way, the Mac way,\n\n73\n00:03:33.507 --> 00:03:34.531\nof doing things.\n\n74\n00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:38.294\nBut the who side, who is it that\nwe're giving permissions to,\n\n75\n00:03:38.294 --> 00:03:42.990\nthat was actually defined as part of\nthe Unix standards back in the 1970s.\n\n76\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.966\nA long, long time ago.\n\n77\n00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:45.533\n&gt;&gt; And\nI thought you were gonna say Doctor Who.\n\n78\n00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:48.877\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well we did timey wimey.\n\n79\n00:03:48.877 --> 00:03:51.129\nSo [LAUGH] we'll save that for\nthe time machine episode.\n\n80\n00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:52.487\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n81\n00:03:52.487 --> 00:03:56.995\n&gt;&gt; So here, there's really three entities\nthat we need to be aware of, right?\n\n82\n00:03:56.995 --> 00:03:58.887\nFirst is the user, right?\n\n83\n00:03:58.887 --> 00:04:01.581\nUser, which in the Unix\nworld it's abbreviated to U.\n\n84\n00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:04.588\nThe user is typically me.\n\n85\n00:04:04.588 --> 00:04:07.003\nI create a document,\nI'm the user for that document.\n\n86\n00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:08.651\nI create a folder,\nI'm the user for that folder.\n\n87\n00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:13.673\nSo the user is whoever owns the content\nthat is potentially being shared or\n\n88\n00:04:13.673 --> 00:04:15.860\nwe're giving permissions to.\n\n89\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.865\nAfter that, we have the group\nwhich is often abbreviated G.\n\n90\n00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:24.895\nThe group, that would be more than one\nperson that I want to give access to.\n\n91\n00:04:24.895 --> 00:04:29.684\nSo if I want all of the ITProTV employees\nto be able to browse to a particular\n\n92\n00:04:29.684 --> 00:04:33.179\nfolder, then I could create\na group called ITProTV.\n\n93\n00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:36.316\nPut all of those employees in that group\nand just give permission to that group.\n\n94\n00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:36.932\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n95\n00:04:36.932 --> 00:04:40.892\n&gt;&gt; Now the nice part about using a group\nis that I can put users in it and\n\n96\n00:04:40.892 --> 00:04:42.190\nI can take users out.\n\n97\n00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.589\nSo if I hire a new employee,\nI just stick them in the ITProTV group and\n\n98\n00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:46.913\nnow they get that access.\n\n99\n00:04:46.913 --> 00:04:49.816\nBefore, I would have to go on assigned\npermissions to them individually,\n\n100\n00:04:49.816 --> 00:04:50.653\nit takes a long time.\n\n101\n00:04:50.653 --> 00:04:52.453\nNow you just stick them in a group.\n\n102\n00:04:52.453 --> 00:04:55.923\nAnd if I fire an employee or\nan employee moves to a new department,\n\n103\n00:04:55.923 --> 00:04:57.952\nI can just take them out of that group.\n\n104\n00:04:57.952 --> 00:05:01.961\nAnd put them in some other more related\ngroup that has the permissions they need.\n\n105\n00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:03.613\nSo that's what a group does.\n\n106\n00:05:03.613 --> 00:05:08.745\nThen it gets a little weird, because\nthe third one is what's called other.\n\n107\n00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:12.773\nOther is technically anybody else.\n\n108\n00:05:12.773 --> 00:05:16.906\nAnybody who's not the user that owns it or\nthe group that's assigned to it.\n\n109\n00:05:16.906 --> 00:05:23.338\nSo other would be things like guests,\nguest accounts, service accounts.\n\n110\n00:05:23.338 --> 00:05:26.496\nUser accounts that aren't a part of\nthe group, that aren't the owner.\n\n111\n00:05:26.496 --> 00:05:28.667\nThose are all gonna fall\nunder this other permission.\n\n112\n00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:31.406\nAnd if I wanna share\nsomething with everybody,\n\n113\n00:05:31.406 --> 00:05:34.223\nit's gonna be that other\npermission that I use.\n\n114\n00:05:34.223 --> 00:05:40.040\nAnd so, in the UNIX world they refer\nto these as U-G-O, user, group, other.\n\n115\n00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.163\nIn Mac-land it's pretty much the same.\n\n116\n00:05:43.163 --> 00:05:45.067\nWe have the user, we have the group.\n\n117\n00:05:45.067 --> 00:05:48.726\nBut then the other will\noftentimes be called everyone, or\n\n118\n00:05:48.726 --> 00:05:51.200\nyou may sometimes see it called staff.\n\n119\n00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.962\nStaff is actually a group, not an other.\n\n120\n00:05:53.962 --> 00:05:55.643\nSo that's not really an appropriate term,\nbut\n\n121\n00:05:55.643 --> 00:05:57.079\nthere are a number of sites that do that.\n\n122\n00:05:57.079 --> 00:06:02.244\nWe typically will see it either as other\nor everyone, or sometimes everyone else.\n\n123\n00:06:02.244 --> 00:06:04.129\nIt just depends on where you're reading.\n\n124\n00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.172\nBut other is the official name for it.\n\n125\n00:06:06.172 --> 00:06:09.034\nAnd that's the terminology that\nwe'll see as we go through and\n\n126\n00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:11.629\nlook at permissions and\ntailor them on a file or a folder.\n\n127\n00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:15.507\nThat you'll see this\nrepresentation of U-G-O.\n\n128\n00:06:15.507 --> 00:06:17.504\n&gt;&gt; Can we see the permissions in the GUI?\n\n129\n00:06:17.504 --> 00:06:18.955\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah you can.\n\n130\n00:06:18.955 --> 00:06:22.145\nIt is all kind of coming from\nthat Unix world in the back end.\n\n131\n00:06:22.145 --> 00:06:25.330\nAnd so in the Unix world we have\nto drop down to the terminal and\n\n132\n00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.965\ndo this from the command line.\n\n133\n00:06:26.965 --> 00:06:31.375\nBut Apple wants this to be easy, so they\nbasically fit the user interface to do it.\n\n134\n00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:34.593\nSo if we take for example here,\nI'll browse on my hard drive.\n\n135\n00:06:34.593 --> 00:06:38.251\nAnd on my hard drive,\nI'm gonna go into the Users folder.\n\n136\n00:06:38.251 --> 00:06:40.247\nAnd I've got a couple of\nuser folders in here.\n\n137\n00:06:40.247 --> 00:06:43.065\nSo you'll see my folder right here,\nso dpezet,\n\n138\n00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:46.169\nit's got a little house on\nit cuz that's my account.\n\n139\n00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:48.792\nZach has a folder here,\nright, so that's his account.\n\n140\n00:06:48.792 --> 00:06:50.588\n&gt;&gt; I want a little house though.\n\n141\n00:06:50.588 --> 00:06:52.840\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you were to logged in,\nyou'd see a little house.\n\n142\n00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.972\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't get the house because at that\n\n143\n00:06:55.972 --> 00:06:57.878\npoint I would be breaking and entering.\n\n144\n00:06:57.878 --> 00:06:59.958\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we don't want that.\n\n145\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.759\n&gt;&gt; So I don't wanna commit a felony or\nmisdemeanor or whatever.\n\n146\n00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:03.793\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't do that.\n\n147\n00:07:03.793 --> 00:07:05.337\n&gt;&gt; But hey, how does it know that?\n\n148\n00:07:05.337 --> 00:07:08.796\nHow does it know that it's not my home\nfolder, that it's Zach's home folder?\n\n149\n00:07:08.796 --> 00:07:12.581\nWell, if you take a folder, or a file,\nright, cuz it works on either.\n\n150\n00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:14.130\nAnd you can do it a few ways.\n\n151\n00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.461\nI normally do Cmd+I.\n\n152\n00:07:15.461 --> 00:07:17.748\nCmd+I is the shortcut for Get Info.\n\n153\n00:07:17.748 --> 00:07:20.992\nBut if you have a Magic Touchpad,\nTrackpad, whatever,\n\n154\n00:07:20.992 --> 00:07:23.506\nyou can two-finger click to get your menu.\n\n155\n00:07:23.506 --> 00:07:27.454\nOr you can control-click if you\ndon't have a Magic Trackpad.\n\n156\n00:07:27.454 --> 00:07:32.057\nAnd when you bring that context menu up,\nyou'll see an option in there for\n\n157\n00:07:32.057 --> 00:07:32.733\nGet Info.\n\n158\n00:07:32.733 --> 00:07:35.462\nAnd again, I usually just do Cmd+I,\nsame thing.\n\n159\n00:07:35.462 --> 00:07:39.920\nAnd in the Get Info screen, you'll see all\nthe details, whoops, about that folder.\n\n160\n00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.968\nSo here's the Zach folder and I can see\ninformation about it, how big it is.\n\n161\n00:07:44.968 --> 00:07:50.693\nIt looks like Zach's never actually logged\nin, so it's right now is 0 bytes on file.\n\n162\n00:07:50.693 --> 00:07:51.877\nAnd I can start to look at that.\n\n163\n00:07:51.877 --> 00:07:56.725\nAnd if I scroll down here towards\nthe bottom of this screen\n\n164\n00:07:56.725 --> 00:08:00.463\nI'll find Sharing &amp; Permissions, okay?\n\n165\n00:08:00.463 --> 00:08:07.140\nAnd what I'm gonna see here is a list\nthat will match u, g, o, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.210\nThe user is the first part,\nthat's the user account.\n\n167\n00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.430\nNow Zach's never actually logged in, so\nit's trying to fetch his user information,\n\n168\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.600\nbut he doesn't technically have any.\n\n169\n00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.280\nHe hasn't logged in yet, so\nthat's why it says fetching right now.\n\n170\n00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.120\nIt's gonna stay saying fetching\nuntil I log in as him or\n\n171\n00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.440\nhe logs in as himself, and it creates\nall the content inside of there.\n\n172\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.300\nBut it's going to show that\nuser that's attached to it.\n\n173\n00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.370\nThen we see staff.\n\n174\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.715\nNow I said how some people refer\nto staff as the other, and\n\n175\n00:08:36.715 --> 00:08:38.085\nthat's not really appropriate.\n\n176\n00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:41.785\nAnd that's especially true here\nbecause staff is the group.\n\n177\n00:08:41.785 --> 00:08:44.055\nSee how it's got two silhouettes there?\n\n178\n00:08:44.055 --> 00:08:46.867\nThis is the group that has\naccess to that folder.\n\n179\n00:08:46.867 --> 00:08:49.007\nAnd then lastly, I've got everyone.\n\n180\n00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:52.477\nIt's got three silhouettes,\nthis is everybody else, or\n\n181\n00:08:52.477 --> 00:08:56.277\nthe other, so I'm seeing u, g and o.\n\n182\n00:08:56.277 --> 00:08:58.722\nLet's switch to my folder\nsince I have logged in.\n\n183\n00:08:58.722 --> 00:09:04.340\nAnd I'll pull up mine, and\nwhen I go look at the same information,\n\n184\n00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.460\nI have logged in, so\nit gets my user name right away.\n\n185\n00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.300\nI see I'm dpezet, hey, it's me.\n\n186\n00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.350\nIt's important that we know that it's us,\ncuz if I go and\n\n187\n00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.830\nremove permissions from myself,\nthat would be bad, right?\n\n188\n00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.530\nYou can actually lock\nyourself out of things.\n\n189\n00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.430\nNot permanently, there's always\na way to get in to recover, but\n\n190\n00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.380\nyou could make it hard for\nyou to access your data.\n\n191\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.140\nAnd then I see staff and everyone,\nand their associated access.\n\n192\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.130\nSo right here in the GUI,\nit's pretty easy to see.\n\n193\n00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.760\nI don't have to know terminal commands.\n\n194\n00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.930\nI don't have to know Unix or BSD.\n\n195\n00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.010\nI can just pop it up right here\ninside of the Get Info screen.\n\n196\n00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.520\n&gt;&gt; Are the permissions assigned\non each and every file or folder?\n\n197\n00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.470\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n\n198\n00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.100\nTechnically, no matter what I look at,\nit's going to have permissions.\n\n199\n00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.850\nSo, for example,\nlet me create a new folder here.\n\n200\n00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.740\nSo I'm just gonna create a new folder,\nwhich I'll call ebooks.\n\n201\n00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.110\nSo I'm gonna have some ebooks stored here.\n\n202\n00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.410\nAnd I've got a USB hard drive hooked\nup that actually has some ebooks on it.\n\n203\n00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.610\nSo I'll just copy them, and\nI'm gonna copy these files and drop them.\n\n204\n00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:07.200\nOr you know what?\n\n205\n00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.043\nMaybe I won't copy,\nI'll just create something all new.\n\n206\n00:10:10.043 --> 00:10:16.057\nSo I'm gonna fire up old TextEdit,\nand I'm gonna create a new document,\n\n207\n00:10:16.057 --> 00:10:20.330\nand this is going to be\nDon's Great American Novel.\n\n208\n00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.490\nAnd so I'm writing my life story or\nwhatever.\n\n209\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.875\nI'm gonna save that,\nwe'll just call it Don's Novel.\n\n210\n00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:32.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and we'll save it right in here.\n\n211\n00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.330\nThere we go.\nDoes novel have two Ls?\n\n212\n00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.520\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No, that's right.\n\n213\n00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.480\n&gt;&gt; Just one.\n\n214\n00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.300\n&gt;&gt; I went to school.\n\n215\n00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:38.975\n&gt;&gt; Novell.\n\n216\n00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:42.920\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I just made a novel, and\n\n217\n00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.900\nit was super easy, I don't know\nwhy more people don't write these.\n\n218\n00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.670\nAnyhow, I got it made, and it's there.\n\n219\n00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:53.032\nThat file has permissions, even though I\ndidn't set them, it does have permissions.\n\n220\n00:10:53.032 --> 00:10:58.072\nAnd so if I pull that up and I take a look\nat the file, and I scroll down here\n\n221\n00:10:58.072 --> 00:11:03.112\nto the bottom, I can see where I have\nread and write access to that file.\n\n222\n00:11:03.112 --> 00:11:04.624\nStaff has read only.\n\n223\n00:11:04.624 --> 00:11:06.724\nEveryone else has read only.\n\n224\n00:11:06.724 --> 00:11:11.512\nSo everybody can read my book but\nonly I can write to it and change it.\n\n225\n00:11:11.512 --> 00:11:13.830\nNow I didn't set those permissions.\n\n226\n00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.600\nI just created the file.\n\n227\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.170\nSo where did those come from?\n\n228\n00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.590\nThat's all part of what's\ncalled permission inheritance,\n\n229\n00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:25.100\nthat these permissions,\nthey come from somewhere else.\n\n230\n00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.780\nThey come from a starting point,\nand that starting point,\n\n231\n00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.530\nif you just installed MacOS,\nthat starting point comes from Apple.\n\n232\n00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.100\nApple made the starting point for\nwhere your permissions are set.\n\n233\n00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.340\nBut if you've had your Mac a while and\nyou've customized things, and\n\n234\n00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.030\nlet's say I change the permissions\non the ebook folder that I made.\n\n235\n00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:47.290\nIf I change the permissions there, any\nnew document that I create inside of it\n\n236\n00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.760\nwill inherit the permissions\nof that folder.\n\n237\n00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.760\nSo that's their starting point.\n\n238\n00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.120\nNow that's just their starting point,\nthey don't have to stay there.\n\n239\n00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.210\nI can come in and change it.\n\n240\n00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.270\nI can modify these permissions and move\nit to something different, but as far as\n\n241\n00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:03.340\nwhere we get from the beginning, these are\nthe default permissions that get assigned.\n\n242\n00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.810\nAnd depending on where\nyou create that document,\n\n243\n00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:07.970\nthe permissions may be different.\n\n244\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.850\nThe permissions are different in Zach's\nfolder than they are in my folder.\n\n245\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.290\nAnd if I've tweaked the settings,\n\n246\n00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.910\nthey could be different in several\nfolders inside of my own profile.\n\n247\n00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.100\nAnd they're definitely different once\nyou get outside of the users folder,\n\n248\n00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.910\ncuz really only the operating system\nshould override the other permissions get\n\n249\n00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:23.460\nreally weird.\n\n250\n00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.510\nBut there is a default set of\npermissions that are put in place where\n\n251\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:31.460\nApple is trying to meet the needs of\nthe most common use-case scenarios.\n\n252\n00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.270\nAnd so that's kind of what\nI've got laid out right here.\n\n253\n00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.100\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\nwhat permissions can we choose from?\n\n254\n00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.212\n&gt;&gt; So we saw two right here.\n\n255\n00:12:39.212 --> 00:12:40.590\nRead and write, and read only.\n\n256\n00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.440\nAnd those are the two most common.\n\n257\n00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.890\nRead and write, like the name implies,\nmeans that I can read.\n\n258\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.440\nI can open the file.\n\n259\n00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.650\nAnd I can change it.\n\n260\n00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.150\nI can write to it.\n\n261\n00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.570\nAnd it doesn't say it, but it's implied\nthat if you're allowed to write to\n\n262\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.470\nthe file that you can\nalso delete the file.\n\n263\n00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.825\nSo if I decide, [LAUGH], this novel is\ngarbage, let me go ahead and delete it-\n\n264\n00:13:00.825 --> 00:13:01.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n265\n00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.545\n&gt;&gt; Or I can rename it Twilight 4 and\nthen it'll sell like crazy.\n\n266\n00:13:04.545 --> 00:13:06.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you can make that choice.\n\n267\n00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.310\nBut I can delete it and then it goes away.\n\n268\n00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.014\nSo that's part of read and write.\n\n269\n00:13:10.014 --> 00:13:12.840\nRead and write means you want\nsomebody to be able to do\n\n270\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.720\npretty much whatever they\nwant to this document.\n\n271\n00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.460\nRead only is far more limited.\n\n272\n00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.450\nRead only is saying, I want somebody to\nbe able to see the document, open it and\n\n273\n00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.580\nread it, but if they try and\nchange it, it won't let them save.\n\n274\n00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.190\nIf they try and delete it,\nit won't let them delete it.\n\n275\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.230\nThey can't do that.\n\n276\n00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.580\nSo those are the two most common,\nbut there are a few others, and\n\n277\n00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.200\nit depends on who you're\nlooking at what you'll see.\n\n278\n00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.480\nSo for example if I click on Read and\nWrite from my user account,\n\n279\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.960\nI can pick between Read &amp; Write and\nRead only, that's it.\n\n280\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.443\nIf I take staff I see the same\nthing Read &amp; Write and Read only.\n\n281\n00:13:51.443 --> 00:13:54.882\nIf I take everyone though,\nI see something else.\n\n282\n00:13:54.882 --> 00:13:59.530\nRead &amp; Write, Read only and No Access.\n\n283\n00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.350\nNo Access says no, you don't get anything.\n\n284\n00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.850\nYou can't read it, you can't write to it.\n\n285\n00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.390\nYou get no access.\n\n286\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:13.620\nSo if it's me, or if's someone in the\nstaff group, they'll be able to read it.\n\n287\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.080\nEverybody else, it's no access.\n\n288\n00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.790\nNow those three right there, those are the\nthree main types of permissions that we're\n\n289\n00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.080\ngonna see when we're working\nwith files like this.\n\n290\n00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.180\nThey're a little bit different\nwhen you look at a folder.\n\n291\n00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.310\nLet me show you on a folder.\n\n292\n00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.580\nSo if I take my ebook folder that I made,\nand I pull up its information,\n\n293\n00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:39.090\nand I come down and look,\nI've got Read &amp; Write and Read only.\n\n294\n00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.906\nBut if I expand it,\nsee how there's another option?\n\n295\n00:14:41.906 --> 00:14:45.470\n&gt;&gt; Write only (Drop Box), and\n\n296\n00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:49.460\nif I come down here I see it on all\nthree of them, Write only (Drop Box).\n\n297\n00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.350\nWhat the heck is that?\n\n298\n00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:55.700\nWell, Read only means I can\njust read the document.\n\n299\n00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.560\nWrite only means I can write to it but\nI can't read it.\n\n300\n00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.750\nNow that sounds really weird, doesn't it?\n\n301\n00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.790\n&gt;&gt; That does sound wierd, yes.\n\n302\n00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.085\n&gt;&gt; It'd be like playing\ndarts with your eyes closed.\n\n303\n00:15:05.085 --> 00:15:06.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; You can-\n\n304\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.300\n&gt;&gt; I tried that once.\n\n305\n00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.370\nThe dog didn't like it.\n\n306\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nhow do you know the score's accurate?\n\n307\n00:15:11.655 --> 00:15:14.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; The dog won, he cheated.\n\n308\n00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.820\nBut what write only is, is it's\na neat little system, because, well,\n\n309\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.930\nI'll give you an example.\n\n310\n00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:27.170\nSo when I was in college, I was the worst\nabout getting term papers done on time.\n\n311\n00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.370\nAnd the professors,\n\n312\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.970\nthey were used to dealing with\nlazy college students like myself.\n\n313\n00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.830\nAnd so what they would do is they'd say,\nyour term paper is due on Friday, or\n\n314\n00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.630\nThursday, or whatever day it is.\n\n315\n00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:44.120\nAnd it needs to be in\nmy office by midnight.\n\n316\n00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.370\nThey would give you until midnight.\n\n317\n00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.753\nNow I don't know if they actually came\nin at midnight to check or whatever.\n\n318\n00:15:48.753 --> 00:15:52.776\nBut you could go to their\noffice at 11:59 PM.\n\n319\n00:15:52.776 --> 00:15:56.633\nYou could take your term paper and\nslide it under the door.\n\n320\n00:15:56.633 --> 00:15:59.697\nAnd then when he or she came in\nthe morning, they'd open the door,\n\n321\n00:15:59.697 --> 00:16:01.362\nthere'd be all these term papers.\n\n322\n00:16:01.362 --> 00:16:03.221\nThey didn't really care\nwhen you dropped it off,\n\n323\n00:16:03.221 --> 00:16:06.242\nas long as it was there that morning, they\nwould then pick them up and grade them.\n\n324\n00:16:06.242 --> 00:16:08.503\nAnd if it wasn't there,\nthen you didn't submit it.\n\n325\n00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:10.171\nAnd that was the end of it, right?\n\n326\n00:16:10.171 --> 00:16:14.903\nWhat I was doing was writing to\nsomething that I couldn't read.\n\n327\n00:16:14.903 --> 00:16:19.541\nOnce I slid my term paper under the door,\ncould I get it back?\n\n328\n00:16:19.541 --> 00:16:21.351\nNo, door was locked, right?\n\n329\n00:16:21.351 --> 00:16:23.213\nCould I change or edit mine?\n\n330\n00:16:23.213 --> 00:16:25.357\nNope, I slid it under the door,\nand it's gone.\n\n331\n00:16:25.357 --> 00:16:25.942\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n332\n00:16:25.942 --> 00:16:28.435\n&gt;&gt; Could I look at\nthe other student's papers?\n\n333\n00:16:28.435 --> 00:16:29.026\n&gt;&gt; Unh-unh.\n\n334\n00:16:29.026 --> 00:16:31.631\n&gt;&gt; No, I didn't have read access.\n\n335\n00:16:31.631 --> 00:16:34.971\nI couldn't read anything,\nI could just write.\n\n336\n00:16:34.971 --> 00:16:38.332\nAnd that's exactly what Dropbox\nis like here in Mac OS.\n\n337\n00:16:38.332 --> 00:16:43.494\nIf I were to set this ebook folder, and\nset it so that staff had Write only,\n\n338\n00:16:43.494 --> 00:16:48.659\nor everyone had Write only, now anybody\ncould browse to my ebook folder,\n\n339\n00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:51.433\nand they could give me an ebook to read.\n\n340\n00:16:51.433 --> 00:16:53.772\nBut they wouldn't be\nable to pull my ebooks.\n\n341\n00:16:53.772 --> 00:16:57.862\nAnd they wouldn't be able to even remove\ntheir own once they've uploaded them.\n\n342\n00:16:57.862 --> 00:16:59.601\nThey're in there, and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n343\n00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:03.683\nSo Dropbox, or Write only permission,\nis a pretty neat thing.\n\n344\n00:17:03.683 --> 00:17:08.705\nBut it's definitely designed for\na particular use case.\n\n345\n00:17:08.705 --> 00:17:11.813\nI give the example of a teacher cuz\nthat is an example that I know.\n\n346\n00:17:11.813 --> 00:17:14.552\nYou might already be thinking\nof a way you can use it,\n\n347\n00:17:14.552 --> 00:17:17.241\nyou might have a server\nthat drops off server logs.\n\n348\n00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:19.245\nAnd you don't want anybody to\nmess with those server logs.\n\n349\n00:17:19.245 --> 00:17:23.646\nSo it's Write only, it writes the logs,\nthey then get stored.\n\n350\n00:17:23.646 --> 00:17:25.958\nAnd you have access to it, and that's it.\n\n351\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.805\nBut whatever it is that you do,\n\n352\n00:17:27.805 --> 00:17:31.296\nthat's what that Write only\npermission is designed for.\n\n353\n00:17:31.296 --> 00:17:34.560\nThere's one more permission I wanna\nhighlight that doesn't show up here,\n\n354\n00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.431\nthat we don't see.\n\n355\n00:17:35.431 --> 00:17:38.128\nAnd that's the execute permission.\n\n356\n00:17:38.128 --> 00:17:38.888\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n357\n00:17:38.888 --> 00:17:43.801\n&gt;&gt; And I could be wrong on this, but I'm\npretty sure you never see it in the GUI.\n\n358\n00:17:43.801 --> 00:17:44.642\nLet me just double-check.\n\n359\n00:17:44.642 --> 00:17:46.632\nI'm gonna go into Applications here.\n\n360\n00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:49.496\nAnd I'll take an application,\nI've got the Apple Configurator.\n\n361\n00:17:49.496 --> 00:17:50.032\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n362\n00:17:50.032 --> 00:17:56.223\n&gt;&gt; And if we take a look at it,\nyeah we've got read.\n\n363\n00:17:56.223 --> 00:18:01.293\nYou might not know this, I can't remember\nif, [LAUGH] we covered it already or\n\n364\n00:18:01.293 --> 00:18:04.650\nnot, but\nApplications are technically a folder.\n\n365\n00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.402\nIt doesn't look like it here, but it is.\n\n366\n00:18:06.402 --> 00:18:11.623\nIf you two-finger click on an application,\nyou could choose Show Package Contents.\n\n367\n00:18:11.623 --> 00:18:12.255\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n368\n00:18:12.255 --> 00:18:15.871\n&gt;&gt; And you can browse in, and\nyou can find the real program.\n\n369\n00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:20.573\nThe real program itself is buried\nin there, and it'll look like this.\n\n370\n00:18:20.573 --> 00:18:23.194\nSo that's the real Apple Configurator\nprogram right there.\n\n371\n00:18:23.194 --> 00:18:23.743\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n372\n00:18:23.743 --> 00:18:26.295\n&gt;&gt; And if I pull up its GUI,\nlet's see if it shows up.\n\n373\n00:18:26.295 --> 00:18:27.642\nIt doesn't show up, okay.\n\n374\n00:18:27.642 --> 00:18:29.604\nSo I don't see execute.\n\n375\n00:18:29.604 --> 00:18:31.962\nBut there is another\npermission called execute.\n\n376\n00:18:31.962 --> 00:18:36.011\nAnd that means if this is a program,\nthen you're allowed to run it.\n\n377\n00:18:36.011 --> 00:18:38.192\nYou're allowed to run the program.\n\n378\n00:18:38.192 --> 00:18:41.603\nA text file you don't need execute on,\nit's not a program, right?\n\n379\n00:18:41.603 --> 00:18:46.398\nBut an application, a script, any kind\nof binary that actually runs a process,\n\n380\n00:18:46.398 --> 00:18:49.091\nwould need to have that\nexecute permission.\n\n381\n00:18:49.091 --> 00:18:53.175\nAnd also folders need\nthe execute permission.\n\n382\n00:18:53.175 --> 00:18:55.870\nWhen you double-click\na folder to browse into it,\n\n383\n00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.201\nthat's considered executing the folder.\n\n384\n00:18:58.201 --> 00:18:59.373\nIt's not real program, right?\n\n385\n00:18:59.373 --> 00:19:00.639\nIs not something running\nin the background.\n\n386\n00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:01.983\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But you're navigating into it.\n\n387\n00:19:01.983 --> 00:19:05.781\nSo that's a fifth permission\nthat we don't see in the GUI.\n\n388\n00:19:05.781 --> 00:19:07.769\nAnd we've never really\nneeded to set it either,\n\n389\n00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:09.623\nthe operating system\ntakes care of that one.\n\n390\n00:19:09.623 --> 00:19:13.329\nBut I wanted to highlight it here\nbecause later on we're gonna talk\n\n391\n00:19:13.329 --> 00:19:18.110\nabout these permissions from the command\nline, and you will see execute from there.\n\n392\n00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.296\nBut Zach's original question was,\ncan I see all this stuff from the GUI?\n\n393\n00:19:21.296 --> 00:19:21.848\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n394\n00:19:21.848 --> 00:19:26.151\n&gt;&gt; Well we can for the most part,\nbut there's a few that are hidden.\n\n395\n00:19:26.151 --> 00:19:30.833\nAnd then as far as setting them,\nRead &amp; Write, Read only, and Write only,\n\n396\n00:19:30.833 --> 00:19:34.286\nDropbox, those are the three\nthat we really work with.\n\n397\n00:19:34.286 --> 00:19:38.187\nAnd then we had no access which\nwas kind of another option.\n\n398\n00:19:38.187 --> 00:19:40.274\nAnd then lastly execute,\nwhich we don't see.\n\n399\n00:19:40.274 --> 00:19:42.663\nSo those are the permissions that\nwe're gonna be choosing from.\n\n400\n00:19:42.663 --> 00:19:46.592\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\nare we limited to just three entries?\n\n401\n00:19:46.592 --> 00:19:47.247\n&gt;&gt; Sort of.\n\n402\n00:19:47.247 --> 00:19:50.481\nSo every example that I've shown you so\nfar, every folder or file,\n\n403\n00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:52.369\nor whatever's that, three entries.\n\n404\n00:19:52.369 --> 00:19:55.242\nYou had the user, the group,\nand the other, right?\n\n405\n00:19:55.242 --> 00:19:59.239\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go back to my ebooks folder here,\n\n406\n00:19:59.239 --> 00:20:00.112\nwhoops.\n\n407\n00:20:00.112 --> 00:20:01.130\nGo away, stop.\n\n408\n00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.251\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay,\nI want to read your novel.\n\n409\n00:20:03.251 --> 00:20:05.809\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna get back to the novel, right?\n\n410\n00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:10.909\nSure, so right now the way that this\nis set is that I have Read &amp; Write,\n\n411\n00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:14.638\nstaff has Read only,\neveryone else has No Access.\n\n412\n00:20:14.638 --> 00:20:16.305\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Let's say that I want Zach.\n\n413\n00:20:16.305 --> 00:20:18.763\nZach's gonna help me write my novel,\nright?\n\n414\n00:20:18.763 --> 00:20:21.033\nSo it's good to have a co-writer.\n\n415\n00:20:21.033 --> 00:20:21.804\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n416\n00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:25.130\n&gt;&gt; So I want him to help.\n\n417\n00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.586\nZach is in the staff group.\n\n418\n00:20:26.586 --> 00:20:32.390\nSo anybody who has a user account on your\ncomputer is a part of the staff group.\n\n419\n00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.712\nSo if I create five user accounts, they're\nall in that staff group by default.\n\n420\n00:20:35.712 --> 00:20:39.551\nI didn't make the staff group,\nit was made by Apple.\n\n421\n00:20:39.551 --> 00:20:42.370\nSo every user on your computer\nis in the staff group.\n\n422\n00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.782\nZach has a user account,\nhe's in staff, so he gets Read only.\n\n423\n00:20:45.782 --> 00:20:47.364\nI want him to be able to write.\n\n424\n00:20:47.364 --> 00:20:50.092\nBut I don't want every\nuser to able to write.\n\n425\n00:20:50.092 --> 00:20:51.401\nSo how do I solve that problem?\n\n426\n00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:52.412\n&gt;&gt; How do you?\n\n427\n00:20:52.412 --> 00:20:55.935\n&gt;&gt; I can't if I just have three entries.\n\n428\n00:20:55.935 --> 00:20:58.106\n&gt;&gt; But Apple thought about that, and so\n\n429\n00:20:58.106 --> 00:21:02.393\nthey've extended out the functionality\nthat was included in BSD Unix.\n\n430\n00:21:02.393 --> 00:21:04.878\nIn the BSD Unix world,\nright now I'd be telling you,\n\n431\n00:21:04.878 --> 00:21:07.542\nyeah you just have three entries and\nthat's it, right?\n\n432\n00:21:07.542 --> 00:21:09.083\nCuz that's how it works.\n\n433\n00:21:09.083 --> 00:21:11.192\nBut in the Apple world,\nthey've added on to it.\n\n434\n00:21:11.192 --> 00:21:13.910\nAnd now we have what are called\nAccess Control Lists.\n\n435\n00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:17.983\nIn ACL, let's just go beyond,\njust these three entries.\n\n436\n00:21:17.983 --> 00:21:22.939\nI can hit the little plus sign down\nhere at the bottom of the window, and\n\n437\n00:21:22.939 --> 00:21:24.713\nI can add another entry.\n\n438\n00:21:24.713 --> 00:21:27.794\nAnd when I do that,\nit's gonna ask who I wanna add.\n\n439\n00:21:27.794 --> 00:21:31.781\nAnd I can see these different accounts\nthat I got on my system here, Zach.\n\n440\n00:21:31.781 --> 00:21:34.413\nAnd so I'm gonna pick him,\nand I'll select.\n\n441\n00:21:34.413 --> 00:21:38.518\nAnd once I do that,\nI now have four entries.\n\n442\n00:21:38.518 --> 00:21:39.852\n[LAUGH] Zach.\n\n443\n00:21:39.852 --> 00:21:40.890\nStill haven't logged in as Zach.\n\n444\n00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.216\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's still gonna show up as\n\n445\n00:21:42.216 --> 00:21:43.014\nfetching for right now.\n\n446\n00:21:43.014 --> 00:21:49.002\nBut he shows up right here in my list,\nand I can choose Read &amp; Write.\n\n447\n00:21:49.002 --> 00:21:53.710\nAnd now he has rejoined, he's in staff,\nso he gets Read only as well.\n\n448\n00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:54.892\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But they combine, and\n\n449\n00:21:54.892 --> 00:21:56.280\nhe gets the best of that.\n\n450\n00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.280\nSo he gets Read &amp; Write.\n\n451\n00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.664\nAnd now he can help me with this novel.\n\n452\n00:22:01.664 --> 00:22:05.343\nAnd technically I've gone beyond what\nnormal Unix permissions can do, and\n\n453\n00:22:05.343 --> 00:22:06.501\nI can keep adding more.\n\n454\n00:22:06.501 --> 00:22:10.122\nI can add more users, more groups,\nadding each one in here,\n\n455\n00:22:10.122 --> 00:22:12.903\nand customizing it exactly\nthe way we want it.\n\n456\n00:22:12.903 --> 00:22:17.413\nSo this is an example where Apple used\nBSD as their core to get that stable\n\n457\n00:22:17.413 --> 00:22:19.306\npowerful operating system.\n\n458\n00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:21.418\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But then they extended it to make it\n\n459\n00:22:21.418 --> 00:22:24.222\na lot more user-friendly,\nand a lot more flexible.\n\n460\n00:22:24.222 --> 00:22:26.482\n&gt;&gt; Is there any limit to that?\n\n461\n00:22:26.482 --> 00:22:27.925\n&gt;&gt; No, you know what,\nthere is a theoretical limit.\n\n462\n00:22:27.925 --> 00:22:28.618\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n463\n00:22:28.618 --> 00:22:30.764\n&gt;&gt; The way these ACL's are stored,\n\n464\n00:22:30.764 --> 00:22:34.755\nthey're actually stored as part\nof your file system tables.\n\n465\n00:22:34.755 --> 00:22:35.300\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n466\n00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.705\nthe file system tables do have a maximum\nsize, but it's pretty, pretty, big.\n\n467\n00:22:39.705 --> 00:22:45.414\n&gt;&gt; So you can add hundreds of entries\nto this list and not hit the maximum.\n\n468\n00:22:45.414 --> 00:22:47.892\nUnfortunately I can't tell you\nwhat the actual maximum is,\n\n469\n00:22:47.892 --> 00:22:49.697\nbecause it's based on\nthe size of the data.\n\n470\n00:22:49.697 --> 00:22:53.811\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So depending on what account ID numbers\n\n471\n00:22:53.811 --> 00:22:58.072\nare being used,\nyou might get more or less.\n\n472\n00:22:58.072 --> 00:22:59.338\nYour mileage may vary.\n\n473\n00:22:59.338 --> 00:23:02.193\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\nBut either way it is in the thousands.\n\n474\n00:23:02.193 --> 00:23:04.104\n&gt;&gt; My.\n&gt;&gt; And if you've got a list that's that\n\n475\n00:23:04.104 --> 00:23:05.784\nbig, you've got bigger problems.\n\n476\n00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:08.573\nYou should be leveraging\ngroups in that case.\n\n477\n00:23:08.573 --> 00:23:12.145\nMost folders,\neven in massive complex environments,\n\n478\n00:23:12.145 --> 00:23:15.724\nyou should be able to get down\nto about maybe ten groups.\n\n479\n00:23:15.724 --> 00:23:19.841\nThat would be considered a lot for\nme if I had ten groups on a single folder.\n\n480\n00:23:19.841 --> 00:23:22.401\nBut you certainly can go pretty high.\n\n481\n00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:25.361\nSo no limit that we really\nneed to worry about.\n\n482\n00:23:25.361 --> 00:23:26.883\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic information.\n\n483\n00:23:26.883 --> 00:23:29.164\nFile permissions, this is part one.\n\n484\n00:23:29.164 --> 00:23:31.670\nThere's two more parts\ncoming before we move on.\n\n485\n00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.369\nDon, anything else you'd like to add?\n\n486\n00:23:34.369 --> 00:23:38.724\n&gt;&gt; The only thing worth mentioning, we\ntalked a little bit about Users &amp; Groups.\n\n487\n00:23:38.724 --> 00:23:40.307\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And we covered that in another episode,\n\n488\n00:23:40.307 --> 00:23:41.775\nso you'll definitely wanna check that out.\n\n489\n00:23:41.775 --> 00:23:44.463\nBut groups make permissions easier.\n\n490\n00:23:44.463 --> 00:23:47.721\nSo I can create a group, and\nstart putting users in there.\n\n491\n00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:48.675\nAnd that's all power.\n\n492\n00:23:48.675 --> 00:23:53.203\nLet me show you a quick,\nI know we do cover it in another episode.\n\n493\n00:23:53.203 --> 00:23:57.317\nBut if you go into your System\nPreferences, inside of System Preferences,\n\n494\n00:23:57.317 --> 00:23:58.681\nyou got Users &amp; Groups.\n\n495\n00:23:58.681 --> 00:24:03.062\nAnd when you go into that,\nyou're going to see all the users.\n\n496\n00:24:03.062 --> 00:24:04.822\nSo here's me, here's Zach.\n\n497\n00:24:04.822 --> 00:24:06.353\nZach's a standard user.\n\n498\n00:24:06.353 --> 00:24:12.041\nAnd I can come in and\ncreate groups as I need them.\n\n499\n00:24:12.041 --> 00:24:15.922\nSo I can come in and\nadd another group like this.\n\n500\n00:24:15.922 --> 00:24:20.121\nAnd maybe I'll call it Novel Editors.\n\n501\n00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:23.851\nSo these are people that I want\nto be allowed to edit my novel.\n\n502\n00:24:23.851 --> 00:24:26.152\nAnd then I can come through and\nI can say well, I'll be in it.\n\n503\n00:24:26.152 --> 00:24:27.514\nZach can be in it.\n\n504\n00:24:27.514 --> 00:24:29.981\nAnybody else, I can start to add them in.\n\n505\n00:24:29.981 --> 00:24:34.181\nAnd so\nnow Zach is in this Novel Editors group.\n\n506\n00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:38.504\nBut the thing is, just putting him in\nthe group doesn't actually give him any\n\n507\n00:24:38.504 --> 00:24:40.712\npermissions, no permissions at all.\n\n508\n00:24:40.712 --> 00:24:42.952\nI've gotta come back to my novel.\n\n509\n00:24:42.952 --> 00:24:45.297\nI've gotta come down here\nto those permissions, and\n\n510\n00:24:45.297 --> 00:24:46.740\nI've gotta add in that group.\n\n511\n00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.950\n&gt;&gt; And\nI could change staff to be Novel Editors.\n\n512\n00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.233\nBut maybe I want all my\nstaff to be able to access,\n\n513\n00:24:53.233 --> 00:24:55.641\nall the users of this computer\nto be able to read it.\n\n514\n00:24:55.641 --> 00:24:58.732\nSo I can just add that\nin as another group.\n\n515\n00:24:58.732 --> 00:25:01.326\nAnd so here's Novel Editors\nis now showing up in my list.\n\n516\n00:25:01.326 --> 00:25:01.852\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n517\n00:25:01.852 --> 00:25:03.522\n&gt;&gt; I can select that.\n\n518\n00:25:03.522 --> 00:25:07.458\nAnd now it's gonna add in, and\nit's gonna say Fetching, cuz again,\n\n519\n00:25:07.458 --> 00:25:09.270\nstill haven't logged in on it.\n\n520\n00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.871\n[COUGH] But\nI can give that one Read &amp; Write.\n\n521\n00:25:10.871 --> 00:25:12.974\nAnd I can actually remove\nZach from the list, but\n\n522\n00:25:12.974 --> 00:25:14.831\nnow I actually can't tell which is which.\n\n523\n00:25:14.831 --> 00:25:17.305\nSo I'm gonna have to log out and\nlog back on before that'll show up.\n\n524\n00:25:17.305 --> 00:25:19.102\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And clean it up a little bit.\n\n525\n00:25:19.102 --> 00:25:21.311\nBut that's basically what it takes.\n\n526\n00:25:21.311 --> 00:25:23.872\nAnd once that's done,\nnow I've leveraged that group.\n\n527\n00:25:23.872 --> 00:25:25.961\nSo using groups, really important.\n\n528\n00:25:25.961 --> 00:25:29.971\nCheck out our episode on Users &amp; Groups\nthat goes into a little more detail.\n\n529\n00:25:29.971 --> 00:25:32.932\nBut as far as permissions are concerned,\nthat's how it works.\n\n530\n00:25:32.932 --> 00:25:33.832\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful information.\n\n531\n00:25:33.832 --> 00:25:34.892\nWell done, Don.\n\n532\n00:25:34.892 --> 00:25:37.793\nFile permissions part one,\nthere will be part two.\n\n533\n00:25:37.793 --> 00:25:38.649\nThere will be part three.\n\n534\n00:25:38.649 --> 00:25:40.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you see all of them.\n\n535\n00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.661\nAnd by the way, this is\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n536\n00:25:43.661 --> 00:25:45.273\nAnd this series is wonderful.\n\n537\n00:25:45.273 --> 00:25:47.090\nMake sure you see every episode.\n\n538\n00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.986\nDon's done a great job putting together\nall that information that you will need,\n\n539\n00:25:50.986 --> 00:25:52.463\nand you will use in the future.\n\n540\n00:25:52.463 --> 00:25:54.209\nAnd by the way,\nyou'll be in the course library.\n\n541\n00:25:54.209 --> 00:25:57.343\nThere's thousands of other videos there,\nall designed to do one thing,\n\n542\n00:25:57.343 --> 00:25:58.260\nhelp you go further.\n\n543\n00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.094\nSo check those out, too.\n\n544\n00:26:00.094 --> 00:26:02.411\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n545\n00:26:02.411 --> 00:26:03.921\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n546\n00:26:03.921 --> 00:26:05.482\nThanks for watching, I'm Zack Memos.\n\n547\n00:26:05.482 --> 00:26:06.003\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITpro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:11.304\n&gt;&gt; Hello thank you for watching ITPro.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:11.304 --> 00:00:12.317\nempowering the word\nwith engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:12.317 --> 00:00:18.778\nI'm your host Zach Memos in\nthis episode of Apple-certified\n\n7\n00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:23.930\nprofessional file permissions, part two.\n\n8\n00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.966\nI promised you it was coming,\nand here it is, and\n\n9\n00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.720\nDon Pezet is going to\ntell us all about it.\n\n10\n00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.600\nDon good to see you.\n\n11\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.290\n&gt;&gt; And we are ready to continue\nour file permissions adventure.\n\n12\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.150\nYou know in last episode, in part one we\ntalked about what the permissions were and\n\n13\n00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.630\nhow we assign them to people.\n\n14\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.720\nAnd we get to see it through\nthe graphical user interface,\n\n15\n00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.246\nwhich for an end-user,\nthat's gonna be how they use it.\n\n16\n00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:49.020\nAnd while it is possible to make a mistake\nin there, it's not that hard to fix it.\n\n17\n00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.610\nIt's pretty hard to lock\nyourself out of something.\n\n18\n00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.300\nSo what we saw was really kid gloves,\nright?\n\n19\n00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n20\n00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.252\n&gt;&gt; But I mentioned more\nthan once in the episodes,\n\n21\n00:00:57.252 --> 00:01:01.890\nhow all these are actually coming from the\nBSD units world that exists underneath-\n\n22\n00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.523\n&gt;&gt; Under the hood.\n\n23\n00:01:03.523 --> 00:01:06.460\n&gt;&gt; of MAC OS, so in this episode,\nwe're gonna take a look at that.\n\n24\n00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.510\nWe're gonna see the actual engine that\npowers these permissions, how it works,\n\n25\n00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.970\nand start to see the stuff that end\nusers should never do themselves.\n\n26\n00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.680\nBut as support professionals\nwill typically be nice tools to\n\n27\n00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.600\nhelp as far as getting in there and fixing\nproblems, and even making changes in bulk.\n\n28\n00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.640\nWe can do a lot of really\ncool things If we just take\n\n29\n00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.390\nthe time to learn the terminal and\nget in there in the command lines.\n\n30\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.690\nThat's what we're gonna be doing\nright here in this episode.\n\n31\n00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.840\n&gt;&gt; Don, how do we view\npermissions from the terminal?\n\n32\n00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, so step one,\nwe've gotta get in the terminal right?\n\n33\n00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.420\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that's kind of important, so\n\n34\n00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.420\nI'm just gonna use my Spotlight here and\nfind terminal.\n\n35\n00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.030\nIf you wanna go through your finder you\ncan browse in your application folder, and\n\n36\n00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.420\nthere'll be a folder in\nthere called utilities.\n\n37\n00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.360\nAnd the terminal is in there,\nbut I always use Spotlight.\n\n38\n00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.300\nSo once you're in your terminal,\nthe terminal is gonna launch and\n\n39\n00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.160\nit's gonna put you in your user directory.\n\n40\n00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.620\nSo I'm logged in as\nan account called dpezet.\n\n41\n00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.570\nAnd if I type pwd, that's present working\ndirectory or print working directory,\n\n42\n00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.890\ndepending on who you ask,\nto show me where the heck I am.\n\n43\n00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.810\nWhen I run that,\nit tells me I'm in /user, /dpezet.\n\n44\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.520\nSo in the GUI, this is the equivalent\nof browsing to your hard drive,\n\n45\n00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.590\nand then browsing to your home folder.\n\n46\n00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.590\nI'm in my home folder and\nI can see that down here.\n\n47\n00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.200\nNow, this is turned off by default,\nso most end users don't see it.\n\n48\n00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.780\nIt's a preference I like to set in\nthe finder, that if you go up to your view\n\n49\n00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.820\nmenu you can see up here\nwhere it's got the path bar,\n\n50\n00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.490\nstatus bar, these kind of things.\n\n51\n00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.120\nAnd that path bar is\nwhat's actually showing me\n\n52\n00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.920\nthe folder that I'm in right down here.\n\n53\n00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.000\nSo I'm able to spot that and get at it.\n\n54\n00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.920\nFrom the command line, I don't see that\nunless I type pwd because it's got\n\n55\n00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.180\nan alias of till [INAUDIBLE] that\ntells you in your home drive.\n\n56\n00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.360\nNow, when I'm in here I can start to look\nat the contents of my folder by typing LS.\n\n57\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.143\nLS is the list command and it's gonna list\nhere's the folders in my home directory,\n\n58\n00:03:02.143 --> 00:03:05.470\n[INAUDIBLE] desktop,\ndownloads, movies and so on.\n\n59\n00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.620\nI'll even see some that might\nbe hidden in the GUI by default,\n\n60\n00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.070\nlike here in the graphical user interface\nI see most of those same folders, right?\n\n61\n00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.590\nBut in the command line,\nI can see a folder called Library.\n\n62\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.770\nIn the GUI,\nLibrary is hidden by default, right?\n\n63\n00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.620\nSo things start to get different\nright off the bat, right,\n\n64\n00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.430\nthere's some things that are different.\n\n65\n00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.380\nOn the permissions side, though,\nif I wanna see the permissions on these\n\n66\n00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.231\nfolders, what I need to do is type LS-L,\n\n67\n00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:39.600\nthat's gonna give us the long\nformat of these files.\n\n68\n00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.140\nThis is the short format,\njust the name of each file or folder.\n\n69\n00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.090\nWhen I do a -l now I see a lot more.\n\n70\n00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.130\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; I see the folder names,\n\n71\n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.060\nI see folder sizes, and I see the other\npermissions kinda laid out right here,\n\n72\n00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.890\nso I can start to spot what\nthose permissions happen to be.\n\n73\n00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.335\nAnd the way they're written\nis a little confusing, so\n\n74\n00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:05.875\nlet me just kind of highlight this\nreally quick, what we're seeing.\n\n75\n00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:06.855\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n76\n00:04:06.855 --> 00:04:08.285\n&gt;&gt; Remember from episode one,\n\n77\n00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:12.945\nor part one, where I talked about user,\ngroup and other.\n\n78\n00:04:12.945 --> 00:04:16.105\nUser was the person that owned the folder,\n\n79\n00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:18.855\ngroup was a group of people\nthat also had access.\n\n80\n00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:21.275\nAnd I keep saying folder because these\nare folders, but this would work for\n\n81\n00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:22.290\nfiles as well.\n\n82\n00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.380\nAnd then other was everybody else.\n\n83\n00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.600\nWell I've only got two columns here,\nnot three.\n\n84\n00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.800\nAnd that's because other, well,\nit's always other, right?\n\n85\n00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.780\nThere's no changing that one,\nit's just hey, this is everybody else.\n\n86\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.700\nSo they don't need to represent that here.\n\n87\n00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.070\nI've got the user,\nall of these are dpezet, and\n\n88\n00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.490\nthen the group, all of these are staff.\n\n89\n00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.820\nBur remember how I\nchanged the desktop one.\n\n90\n00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.920\nSo, if I were to go into my\ndesktop folder, and then into,\n\n91\n00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.050\nI think that folder was called\neBooks right, or what was it called?\n\n92\n00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.600\nYou know what I renamed it\nafter that show to files.\n\n93\n00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.160\nSo, if I come in here and look,\n\n94\n00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.500\nthere's that Don's novel that\nwe were working with in part 1.\n\n95\n00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.610\nSo, if I do a long listing on that and\n\n96\n00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.024\nI see Don's Novel, I've got the user\nis dpezet and the group is staff.\n\n97\n00:05:09.024 --> 00:05:12.069\nThat's right, I didn't change that,\nI added to it.\n\n98\n00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.270\nAll right, so if I'd changed it, I would\nsee it right here represented that way.\n\n99\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.450\nBut on the left side is where I'm\nseeing the actual permissions.\n\n100\n00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.040\nAnd the permissions,\n\n101\n00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.990\nmight not make a whole lot of sense\nwhen I first glance at it, right?\n\n102\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.510\nBecause what we're used to Apple's GUI,\nwhich you could be seeing for\n\n103\n00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.790\nthe first time and it would make sense.\n\n104\n00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.970\nHere it's not going to make\nsense the first time you see it.\n\n105\n00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.530\nSo let me explain what these settings are,\nright?\n\n106\n00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.840\nWhat we're actually seeing\nare ten letters or hyphens, okay.\n\n107\n00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.460\nIf there is a letter,\nit means some kind of permission is set,\n\n108\n00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.980\nif there is a hyphen,\nit means no permissions are set, right?\n\n109\n00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.170\nAnd the letter dictates a few things.\n\n110\n00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.979\nThe very first letter where I've got a d,\nd means directory.\n\n111\n00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.160\nThis is a folder.\n\n112\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.940\nIf it's a dash, then it's a file.\n\n113\n00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.700\nSo Don's Novel here shows up with a dash\nat the beginning because it's a file.\n\n114\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.350\nAnd then the eBooks folder shows up with\na d because it's a directory, right?\n\n115\n00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.300\nSo that's the first one,\nnot really permissions, right?\n\n116\n00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.620\nJust kind of the identity of that item.\n\n117\n00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.800\nBut the next nine characters\nare all permissions, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.410\nIt's actually three blocks of three.\n\n119\n00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:31.110\nInside of each one you have R,W,\nand X, read, write and execute.\n\n120\n00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.231\nIn the first block of three\nis the user's permission.\n\n121\n00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:41.360\nThe second block of three\nis the group's permission.\n\n122\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.740\nAnd the third block of three\nis the other permission, UGO.\n\n123\n00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.490\nSo looking at my eBooks directory\nI can see where the user,\n\n124\n00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.540\nme, I have read, write, and execute.\n\n125\n00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.566\nI can read what's in the folder, I can\nwrite to create new items in the folder,\n\n126\n00:06:58.566 --> 00:06:59.550\nand I can execute.\n\n127\n00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.370\nWhich means I can double click on\nthe folder and browse into it.\n\n128\n00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.010\nRead, write and execute.\n\n129\n00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.740\nStaff has read and execute.\n\n130\n00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.560\nThey can read what's in the folder,\nthey can double-click to open the folder.\n\n131\n00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.490\nBut they can't change\nanything inside of it.\n\n132\n00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.740\nAnd then other is the same.\n\n133\n00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.050\nThey can read and they can execute.\n\n134\n00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.440\nUser group other.\n\n135\n00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.100\nBut if you look at my novel,\nI have read and write.\n\n136\n00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.900\nI don't have execute,\ncuz this is not a program.\n\n137\n00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.630\nIt's not a program that runs,\nit's just a text document.\n\n138\n00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:33.210\nI'm gonna use text editor some other\nprogram to open I'll need execute on that.\n\n139\n00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.320\nBut I don't need execute for\nthis document so I have read and write.\n\n140\n00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.675\nStaff has read, they've got read only.\n\n141\n00:07:38.675 --> 00:07:40.335\nThey can open it and look at it.\n\n142\n00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:41.835\nThat's these three,\n\n143\n00:07:41.835 --> 00:07:46.495\noops, these three values if I can,\ncome on, I know how to highlight right?\n\n144\n00:07:46.495 --> 00:07:48.014\nAll right,\napparently I don't know how to highlight.\n\n145\n00:07:48.014 --> 00:07:50.123\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's these three right here,\n\n146\n00:07:50.123 --> 00:07:56.375\nthere we go, r--, they've got read, they\ndon't have write, they don't have execute.\n\n147\n00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.662\nAnd then other Others\nare absolutely nothing.\n\n148\n00:07:58.662 --> 00:08:00.041\nDash, dash, dash.\n&gt;&gt; Dash, dash, dash.\n\n149\n00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:00.686\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n150\n00:08:00.686 --> 00:08:01.418\nThey can't read.\n\n151\n00:08:01.418 --> 00:08:02.500\nThey can't write.\n\n152\n00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.240\nThey can't execute.\n\n153\n00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.500\nThey can not see a great\nAmerican novel by Don Pezet.\n\n154\n00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.250\nThey don't know what they are missing.\n\n155\n00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.015\nBut that's the permissions that are set.\n\n156\n00:08:11.015 --> 00:08:14.710\nSo from the command line,\nthings look totally different.\n\n157\n00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:15.288\nRight?\n\n158\n00:08:15.288 --> 00:08:19.420\nIt was oso much easier from\nthe GUI to be able to come in and\n\n159\n00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.260\ntake that novel, do a command i.\n\n160\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:27.420\nScroll down and look, and\nthere is me, staff, everyone.\n\n161\n00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.595\nAnd you can see where\neveryone has no access.\n\n162\n00:08:29.595 --> 00:08:32.050\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's far easier, right?\n\n163\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.530\nBut, from the command line,\nwe do see that same information.\n\n164\n00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.670\nSo Apple has hidden this from us,\nhidden the Unix way of doing things, and\n\n165\n00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:42.530\nmade it a heck of a lot easier.\n\n166\n00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.020\n&gt;&gt; Well,\ncan we change permissions as well?\n\n167\n00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.820\n&gt;&gt; You can, yeah,\nyou can change the permissions.\n\n168\n00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.290\nIt's a little tricky,\ndefinitely not intuitive.\n\n169\n00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.700\nLike you can't just stumble in, and\nclick, and try and solve this one.\n\n170\n00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.270\nYou've got to use particular commands,\nall right.\n\n171\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:09:00.070\nTo change permissions,\nwe have to use a command called chmod, or\n\n172\n00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.660\nchange mode, right.\n\n173\n00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.750\nWhich is just changing the permissions\nmode on a particular file.\n\n174\n00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:11.100\nAnd so I can say chmod and\nthen tell it what I want to change.\n\n175\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.740\nAnd then tell it the file\nthat I want to change.\n\n176\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.818\nSo, for example, the ebooks folder,\n\n177\n00:09:17.818 --> 00:09:21.930\nright now I have it to\nwhere staff can read and\n\n178\n00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.880\nexecute, and\neveryone can read and execute.\n\n179\n00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.320\nSo maybe I want staff to be\nable to read-write and execute.\n\n180\n00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.120\nI want them to be able\nto create stuff in here.\n\n181\n00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.330\nAnd the other, maybe I don't want\nthem to have any access whatsoever.\n\n182\n00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.370\nSo, in order to do that I need\nto remember six letters alright.\n\n183\n00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.690\nThe letters are U-G-O.\n\n184\n00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.116\nThat's User, Group, Other.\n\n185\n00:09:45.116 --> 00:09:47.514\nAnd then, R-W-X.\n\n186\n00:09:47.514 --> 00:09:50.210\nRead, Write, and Execute.\n\n187\n00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.320\nI can use any combination\nof those to add or\n\n188\n00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.380\nremove permissions to a folder or a file.\n\n189\n00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:01.620\nSo if I want to take away read and\nexecute for the other account\n\n190\n00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.830\non this ebooks folder, I can say chmod and\nthen I'm gonna do o for\n\n191\n00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:12.220\nother,- because I'm\ntaking away permissions.\n\n192\n00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:17.780\nAnd I'm gonna take away r and\nx, I'm saying o minus rx, and\n\n193\n00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:23.590\nthen the name of the folder that I want to\noverride, mine's called eBooks, all right.\n\n194\n00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:28.640\nSo when I run that,\nthat's taking away those permissions.\n\n195\n00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.840\nIf I wanna add permissions, so\nI want staff to be able to write.\n\n196\n00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.490\nThey've already got read and execute.\n\n197\n00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.310\nI can see that right here.\n\n198\n00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.070\nThey've got r-x.\n\n199\n00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.640\nSo I want them to also be able to write.\n\n200\n00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.350\nSo I need to say chmod and\nthen ugo, right?\n\n201\n00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.340\nThis is the group.\n\n202\n00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.530\nI want the group and\nI want to add write permissions.\n\n203\n00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:53.730\nSo, I'm going to do a plus,\nI'm adding permissions, and a W.\n\n204\n00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:58.698\nSo, plus, W and\nI'll specify eBooks again as well.\n\n205\n00:10:58.698 --> 00:11:02.530\nNow, let me point out something real\nquick, I'm using Tab auto complete, and\n\n206\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.860\nwhen you do that on a folder it\nputs this trailing slash on there.\n\n207\n00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.790\nThat's not normally a problem,\nyou can leave it there, but\n\n208\n00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:14.150\nsome of the UNIX commands get a little\nupset if that trailing slash is there, so\n\n209\n00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.120\nI usually delete it.\n\n210\n00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.752\nSo if you noticed me deleting this,\nthat's what I do.\n\n211\n00:11:17.752 --> 00:11:18.950\nNot always required,\n\n212\n00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:23.690\nespecially if we're trying to change\nthe permissions not just on this folder.\n\n213\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.690\nBut on everything inside of the folder.\n\n214\n00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:31.990\nRight now, when I run this command,\nit's running just on the folder itself.\n\n215\n00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:36.100\nI'm not giving people write permission on\neverything inside of the folder, right?\n\n216\n00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:41.010\nIf I wanted to go inside of the folder\nas well, then what I need to do is\n\n217\n00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:46.600\nadd a dash R to the command, and\nthat's gonna make it recursive.\n\n218\n00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.630\nRecursive means hit the folder and\neverything inside of it.\n\n219\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:55.030\nNow, if I put the slash there, it won't\nchange the permissions on the folder\n\n220\n00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.420\nFolder, it will change the permissions\non everything inside of it.\n\n221\n00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:03.750\nIf I take away the slash, it will\nchange permissions on the folder and\n\n222\n00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.700\neverything inside of it.\n\n223\n00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.020\nAnd that's normally what I want.\n\n224\n00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.290\nI am going to have them delete that slash.\n\n225\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.510\nBut I wanted to point that I have here,\n\n226\n00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.110\nis that I caught myself doing it a second\nhere and I didn't say what I was doing.\n\n227\n00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.270\nI wanted to be real clear on that.\n\n228\n00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.580\nThat slash actually does have an impact.\n\n229\n00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.180\nBut now it's gonna go in and it's gonna\nchange those permissions on those items.\n\n230\n00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.000\nAnd when I run that I don't\nget a lot of feedback, right?\n\n231\n00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.880\nSo did it work?\n\n232\n00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.580\nWell, if I got an error I would know it.\n\n233\n00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.860\nAn error would come up on the screen.\n\n234\n00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.180\nSo it looks like it worked.\n\n235\n00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.330\nLet's verify.\n\n236\n00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:37.320\nI'm gonna do an ls- l And\ntake a look at those permissions and\n\n237\n00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.100\nsure enough on that ebooks folder I\ncan see where the group now has read,\n\n238\n00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:47.400\nwrite and execute and\nthe other has nothing.\n\n239\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.380\nRight?\nSo it did work.\n\n240\n00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.840\nNow I did this as two\nseparate commands because for\n\n241\n00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.250\nmost of you this is the first\ntime you've seen it.\n\n242\n00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.410\nBut we can actually combine a lot of\nthis stuff and do it all as one command.\n\n243\n00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:05.240\nSo for example I could have said\nchmod- R to make it recursive.\n\n244\n00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.790\nI could have said, well here I'll\nundo the changes that I made.\n\n245\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.170\nSo I'm gonna add re and\nexecute back for other.\n\n246\n00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.720\nAnd I'm gonna take away right or\nrough stuff.\n\n247\n00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.840\nSo I'm gonna say, o+rx, so\n\n248\n00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.630\nI'm giving them reading xq park,\nand then I'm gonna do a coma, and\n\n249\n00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:29.640\nI'll say, g-w, I'm taking away a right.\n\n250\n00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.410\nSo you can actually set,\nug and o all the same time.\n\n251\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.470\nYou can just separate them with a coma.\n\n252\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.730\nAnd then you specify that folder or\nfile right?\n\n253\n00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.140\nAnd so I can run that, and\n\n254\n00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.145\nnow its gonna knock them all out at once,\nall in one command.\n\n255\n00:13:45.145 --> 00:13:47.990\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It's not the most intuitive command but\n\n256\n00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.870\nit certainly does work, and\nit gets in there and sets it.\n\n257\n00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.890\nAnd now if I take a look at those,\n\n258\n00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.875\nI can see those permissions are put back\nto the way that I wanted them to be.\n\n259\n00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:57.280\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n260\n00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.340\nNow there's one more example I\nwant to give you here real quick.\n\n261\n00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:08.910\nWhen I took the other and\nI took away read and execute, right?\n\n262\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.190\nI took away their permissions.\n\n263\n00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.860\nI took away both read and execute,\nso I had to do O minus RX.\n\n264\n00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.670\nWhat if, I didn't really know what\nthe permissions were set like throughout\n\n265\n00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.650\nthe folder, maybe they were mixed\npermissions that were all over the place,\n\n266\n00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.860\nand I just wanted to\noverride the permissions.\n\n267\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.075\nI just want to change the permissions,\n\n268\n00:14:30.075 --> 00:14:36.715\noverride them to being a certain way,\ninstead of using plus or\n\n269\n00:14:36.715 --> 00:14:42.843\nminus, you can use an equal sign,\nIf I were to say chmod,\n\n270\n00:14:42.843 --> 00:14:48.462\nI'll do a -R for person again,\nI could say u=rwx,\n\n271\n00:14:48.462 --> 00:14:54.640\nand then I'll say g= rx,\nand then I'll say o=rx.\n\n272\n00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.180\nAll right and\nthen I'll specify that eBooks folder.\n\n273\n00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.420\nBy using the equal sign I'm saying,\n\n274\n00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.860\nI don't care what permissions\nare there right now.\n\n275\n00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.920\nOverwrite them and\nset them to be this way, all right?\n\n276\n00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.480\nI don't care if they already have read or\nexecute or write or whatever, so\n\n277\n00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:16.530\nlike if the group had write permissions\nThis is gonna over write that and they're\n\n278\n00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:21.140\ngonna lose the right permission cuz it's\ngonna equal rx so that's gonna force\n\n279\n00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.800\nthose permissions in place and now they'll\nbe set exactly the way that I want.\n\n280\n00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.050\nThis command right here is one that I use\na lot when permission's get messed up\n\n281\n00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.590\nif somebody locks\nthemselves out of a folder\n\n282\n00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.020\nI can drop to a terminal with\nan administrative account And\n\n283\n00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:41.510\nI can use this command to overwrite and\nfix their folder.\n\n284\n00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:45.770\nSo you can kinda reset\nit back to a baseline.\n\n285\n00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.300\nAnother one that I'll end up using,\n\n286\n00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.640\nlet's say Zach accidentally got\nlocked out of his home folder.\n\n287\n00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.590\n&gt;&gt; It can happen.\n\n288\n00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.508\n&gt;&gt; It can happen.\n\n289\n00:15:53.508 --> 00:15:57.406\nSo I might say sudo, cuz I'll need\nto be an administrator to do this,\n\n290\n00:15:57.406 --> 00:15:59.210\nI'll say sudo.\n\n291\n00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.900\nchmod -R, I want this to be recursive.\n\n292\n00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.061\nAnd then I'll say u+rwx,\n\n293\n00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:09.600\nI'm adding read, write and execute.\n\n294\n00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.329\nAnd I'll specify /users/zach.\n\n295\n00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:21.330\nAnd so now, Zach should be the owner of\nhis own photo, he should be the user.\n\n296\n00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:26.250\nAnd this would add read, write and execute\nfor his account to everything inside\n\n297\n00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.160\nof his home folder, which should\ngrant him access back in there.\n\n298\n00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.220\nIt's a quick way to\napply a reset there and\n\n299\n00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.350\nget him where he can get\nback into his information.\n\n300\n00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.560\nSo those are all different\nexamples right there,\n\n301\n00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.500\nof how we can change those permissions\nright from the command line.\n\n302\n00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.830\nIt's not easy.\n\n303\n00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.200\nBut once you know how to do it,\njust the fact that we can do this in bulk,\n\n304\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.700\nthat we can reset thousands\nof files with one command,\n\n305\n00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.460\nthat makes this really handy from\na support professional standpoint.\n\n306\n00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.280\n&gt;&gt; That's a good reason\nto use the terminal.\n\n307\n00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.750\nBut what about the owner and group,\ncan they be changed as well?\n\n308\n00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:58.420\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, right?\n\n309\n00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.490\nSo my example here,\nI'm just doing the user, right?\n\n310\n00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n311\n00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:07.480\nwhen we're overwriting other folders,\nyou can certainly come in and\n\n312\n00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:12.380\nspecify that you wanna set the G or the O.\n\n313\n00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:17.790\nThe only thing here is,\nI don't necessarily know who the G or\n\n314\n00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.274\nthe O, I guess,\nI always knew who the O is, right?\n\n315\n00:17:20.274 --> 00:17:21.048\n[INAUDIBLE] other, right?\n\n316\n00:17:21.048 --> 00:17:22.910\nBut the G, I might not know that.\n\n317\n00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:27.520\nLike maybe somebody has\nchanged that group, right?\n\n318\n00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.962\nSo let me,\nwell let me give you an example here.\n\n319\n00:17:29.962 --> 00:17:32.710\nI'm gonna get to my,\nwhere actually where am I, I'm lost.\n\n320\n00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:33.917\nLet me get to my desktop.\n\n321\n00:17:33.917 --> 00:17:37.222\nAll right, so here I am on my desktop, and\n\n322\n00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:40.999\nmaybe I have taken my\ngreat American novel, and\n\n323\n00:17:40.999 --> 00:17:45.730\nI'm gonna make a copy of that and\njust plop it on my desktop.\n\n324\n00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.280\nAll right, here it is.\n\n325\n00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.730\nAnd I'm gonna take it in a GUI,\nand I will modify that.\n\n326\n00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:58.330\nSo I'm gonna get rid of some of\nthese other things that we added.\n\n327\n00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:03.980\nGet rid of you, Zach, and I'm gonna\ntake this where we've got staff, right?\n\n328\n00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:08.010\nAnd when you have staff, if I hit minus.\n\n329\n00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.810\nIt's gonna try and take that away and\nit gets a little upset with me, right?\n\n330\n00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.340\nI'm actually get in a warning right\nhere telling me the operation can't be\n\n331\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.570\ncompleted because you don't\nhave necessary permission.\n\n332\n00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.610\nIt is not happy about that,\nit has to have a group there.\n\n333\n00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.796\nAnd it looks like I can't change it,\nright?\n\n334\n00:18:24.796 --> 00:18:31.660\nI could add the other group and if I do\nthat, if I put the NovelEditors back in.\n\n335\n00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.900\nOkay, so now NovelEditors are here.\n\n336\n00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.665\nI come to staff and remove them,\nnow let's remove them.\n\n337\n00:18:37.665 --> 00:18:42.310\nCuz I have to have some kind of group,\nright.\n\n338\n00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:46.490\nSo I've got that in place,\nI've modified that here in the GUI.\n\n339\n00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.350\nIf I look at it from the command line.\n\n340\n00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:53.290\nAnd I pull that up,\nI can see where Don's Novel\n\n341\n00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:58.200\nnow has a group of NovelEditors, okay.\n\n342\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.210\nBut I had to fight with\na little bit there, didn't I?\n\n343\n00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I had to add the group, and\n\n344\n00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.440\nthen I had to take away staff.\n\n345\n00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.090\nImagine if I had to do\nthat on a thousand files?\n\n346\n00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.060\n&gt;&gt; That would not be good.\n\n347\n00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.580\n&gt;&gt; It would take a long time, right?\n\n348\n00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.760\nSo if I wanted to set\na chains like that and\n\n349\n00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.760\ndo if an entire folder, that becomes\na little bit more of a challenge.\n\n350\n00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:23.800\nSo instead of doing ch group,\nthere is another, I'm sorry chmod.\n\n351\n00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:30.610\nThere's another command we can use which\nis chown, that's change owner, right?\n\n352\n00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:32.860\nThere's another command called chgrp,\n\n353\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.300\nwhich is change group, and\nI wanna change the group.\n\n354\n00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.538\nSo, it sounds like I should\nbe showing that command,\n\n355\n00:19:37.538 --> 00:19:39.280\nthat's what I said a second ago.\n\n356\n00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:46.760\nBut I rarely use chgrp because chown can\nchange both the owner and the group.\n\n357\n00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.900\nSo if one command that can do\nboth makes life a lot easier.\n\n358\n00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.150\nIf I wanna change it, so\n\n359\n00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:56.520\nmaybe I wanna put Don's Novel back to\nhaving staff as the group, all right?\n\n360\n00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:02.470\nAll I have to do is say, chown and\nspecify who I want the owner to be.\n\n361\n00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.420\nAnd then a colon and\nwho I want the group to be.\n\n362\n00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.420\nAnd then I specify the file\nthat I'm overwriting.\n\n363\n00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.680\nNow, Don's Novel has spaces in the name,\nand so in the terminal,\n\n364\n00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.870\nmake my hands on top of it.\n\n365\n00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.210\nThere we go.\n\n366\n00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:19.880\nIn the terminal, see how I put\nbackslashes before the space and\n\n367\n00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.470\nbefore that apostrophe.\n\n368\n00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.990\nIn the UNIX world, you have to have that.\n\n369\n00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.560\nIf you use TAB Autocomplete, it will\nfix it for you, which is kind of nice.\n\n370\n00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:32.220\nBut when I run this, that's gonna\nchange the owner and the group for me.\n\n371\n00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:37.890\nAnd if I take a look at the list, now\nthe group is back to being staff, right.\n\n372\n00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.800\nSo it flipped it and fixed that.\n\n373\n00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.580\nI didn't have to add one group than take\nthe other, it's just all done at once.\n\n374\n00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:50.920\nAnd I could have used chgrp to do that,\nchgrp is kind of the same thing.\n\n375\n00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:57.090\nYou would come through and say like,\nhere it was NovelEditors like that.\n\n376\n00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:03.126\nNovelEditors and I could have say\n\n377\n00:21:03.126 --> 00:21:08.040\nchown :NovelEditors like that.\n\n378\n00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.350\nBy not specifying a username, that means\nleave it as whoever the user is right now,\n\n379\n00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.460\nall right?\n\n380\n00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.470\nAnd then there's the colon followed by\nthe group name and I can run it and\n\n381\n00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.830\nnow it just overrides that group name.\n\n382\n00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:24.060\nAnd so it's set right there\nwith that same command and\n\n383\n00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.230\nif I look at it,\nnow it is set to NovelEditors.\n\n384\n00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.110\nIf I use the chgrp command\nI mentioned earlier,\n\n385\n00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.730\nit can only change the group, right?\n\n386\n00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:32.800\nSo it does the same thing.\n\n387\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.500\nI can get rid of the colon and\ndo chgrp like that, and\n\n388\n00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.350\nnow it'll change that group, or actually,\ncuz it was already NovelEditors,\n\n389\n00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.280\nlet me make that staff instead.\n\n390\n00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.120\nAnd now it'll change, so\n\n391\n00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.535\nthere's several different ways to do this,\nI've gotten the habit of just using chown.\n\n392\n00:21:51.535 --> 00:21:55.070\nCuz it can do the user and the group and\n\n393\n00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.230\nthey both except the -R\ncommand to be recursive.\n\n394\n00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:02.950\nSo if I wanted to change that group for an\nentire folder I could, I could come in and\n\n395\n00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.710\nsay, chown.\n\n396\n00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:11.880\nI'll leave the user alone cuz it's me,\nI'll do :NoverlEditors,\n\n397\n00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.080\nso I'm gonna change the group\nto NovelEditors and\n\n398\n00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.190\noops, I need to add that -R that I was\ntalking about here in the beginning.\n\n399\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.820\nAnd then I'll say, NovelEditors and\n\n400\n00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:24.885\nthen I'm gonna specify the files folder.\n\n401\n00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:30.130\nAnd so now the files folder and\neverything inside of it\n\n402\n00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:34.770\nshould get changed, so\nthat the group is NovelEditors.\n\n403\n00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.740\nAnd if I pull up my listing,\nI can see the folder got it.\n\n404\n00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:43.120\nAnd if I get inside of it,\nI can see NovelEditors right there.\n\n405\n00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.420\nThey've been assigned and so\n\n406\n00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:49.790\nit's all being done right there using\nthese chown or change owner command.\n\n407\n00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.720\nEasy way to get in and modify it and\nin this case it's actually\n\n408\n00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.080\nfaster than the GUI just because I\ndon't have to worry about adding and\n\n409\n00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.360\nremoving the groups and so on, to get\nthat kind of set the way that I want.\n\n410\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.860\n&gt;&gt; Can we work with ACL based\npermissions in the terminal?\n\n411\n00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.260\n&gt;&gt; ACLs, I almost forgot about those.\n\n412\n00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.696\nIn part one, we talked about ACLs.\n\n413\n00:23:08.696 --> 00:23:10.560\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We normally have user group and\n\n414\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.820\nother but if we want more, we can, right?\n\n415\n00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.950\nAnd actually, I guess I still have\nit up here in the background.\n\n416\n00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:21.450\nThis is the info for my Don's Novel file.\n\n417\n00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:26.980\nAnd if I look down here at the ownership,\n\n418\n00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:31.100\nwe've got the user,\nthe group, and the other.\n\n419\n00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:37.600\nBut I've also got Zach and, and I've got\nNovelEditors twice, how did that happen?\n\n420\n00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:42.311\nThis happens when you've got an ACL,\nthe additional permissions aren't\n\n421\n00:23:42.311 --> 00:23:46.960\nstored the UNIX way, they're stored\nin a separate access control list.\n\n422\n00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:53.750\nSo because I changed NovelEditors to be\nthe group in the UNIX world, that's here.\n\n423\n00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.690\nAnd then I also changed it in\nthe ACL world, so it's listed twice.\n\n424\n00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:00.160\nAnd that's not really a good place to be,\ncuz it creates confusion.\n\n425\n00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.312\nSo, what I should do is fix that and\n\n426\n00:24:02.312 --> 00:24:06.480\nactually I could just go back to\nthe other file where it'd be fine.\n\n427\n00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.350\nBut let's make sure I'm\nworking with the right file.\n\n428\n00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:15.090\nSo, I'm going to get back to my\ndesktop and I'm going to change\n\n429\n00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.100\nthat file, The Don's Novel,\nto be owned by staff again.\n\n430\n00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.880\nI'm just gonna put that back\nto the way that it was.\n\n431\n00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.630\nAnd so now when I come in and\nI look at those permissions, here we go,\n\n432\n00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.570\nthis one's back to normal now.\n\n433\n00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.000\nI've got me, staff, everyone, that's it.\n\n434\n00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n435\n00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:39.160\n&gt;&gt; And if I come in and\nI add novel editors or\n\n436\n00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:44.420\neven Zach specifically,\nI can bring them in.\n\n437\n00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.650\nAnd I start adding these permissions.\n\n438\n00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:52.990\nNow these permissions are not\nin the regular Unix permissions.\n\n439\n00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.168\nSo you see zach and NovelEditors-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n440\n00:24:55.168 --> 00:24:56.640\n&gt;&gt; Both have Read &amp; Write, okay?\n\n441\n00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:03.599\nIf I go back to my command line and\nI take a look at those permissions.\n\n442\n00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.310\nI can see Don's Novel.\n\n443\n00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.410\nAnd I see that I have read and write.\n\n444\n00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:16.030\nStaff as read only and\neveryone else has nothing.\n\n445\n00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.960\nSo where's Zach and\nwhere's the novel editors?\n\n446\n00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.140\nAll right.\n\n447\n00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.565\nWell, remember earlier I said that\nthere were 10 letters or hyphens?\n\n448\n00:25:23.565 --> 00:25:25.170\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; This one has 11.\n\n449\n00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.580\nThis one goes to 11.\n\n450\n00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.028\nThat's Spinal Tap.\n\n451\n00:25:29.028 --> 00:25:33.748\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Eleven, in this case, is an @ symbol.\n\n452\n00:25:33.748 --> 00:25:38.880\nThat @ symbol is letting me know that\nthere is an access control list.\n\n453\n00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.050\nThere is more permissions,\nthan what we can see here.\n\n454\n00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.780\nTransformers, there is\nmore than meets the eye.\n\n455\n00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.270\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; There is more permissions than\n\n456\n00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.730\nwhat I see here.\n\n457\n00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:50.850\nAnd when I do an ls -l,\nI'm telling it to give me the long format,\n\n458\n00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:54.230\nbut that's the long Unix format.\n\n459\n00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.570\nSo Apple came in and\nsaid we need a little more.\n\n460\n00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.670\nAnd they added that, with that at symbol.\n\n461\n00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:06.530\nAnd if I wanna see that something more,\nI need to say ls -l@.\n\n462\n00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.810\nIf you type the @ symbol in there,\n\n463\n00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:13.230\nnow when I run that it's going to\ngive me a little more information.\n\n464\n00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.350\nAnd shoot, actually I'm, no I was right.\n\n465\n00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.710\nNo, that was wrong.\n\n466\n00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.980\nSo sorry, I mixed it up.\n\n467\n00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.820\nThere's actually two\ndifferent sets of extensions.\n\n468\n00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.136\nMetadata is one part.\n\n469\n00:26:25.136 --> 00:26:26.420\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And the @ symbol I just did,\n\n470\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.950\nls -l@\n&gt;&gt; That shows the metadata, so\n\n471\n00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.020\nI did the wrong thing.\n\n472\n00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:34.190\nSo what I need to do is ls -le for\nthe extended permissions.\n\n473\n00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.120\nThe wrong thing.\n\n474\n00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.450\nWe'll talk about metadata in\na minute because it is important.\n\n475\n00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So even though I did it be accident,\n\n476\n00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.560\nwe will turn it into something useful.\n\n477\n00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.956\nPretend like I did that on purpose.\n\n478\n00:26:43.956 --> 00:26:44.789\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n479\n00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:46.930\nls -le, though, that's the one I want.\n\n480\n00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.230\nThere we go.\n\n481\n00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:52.850\n&gt;&gt; And now when I look at it,\nI can see the user, the group and\n\n482\n00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.450\nwhat would be other.\n\n483\n00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.420\nI can see their permissions,\nstandard Unix style.\n\n484\n00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.740\nAnd then right afterwards,\nhere is users at.\n\n485\n00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.790\nWho has read and write.\n\n486\n00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.320\nHere is group, noveleditors,\nwho has read and write.\n\n487\n00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.380\nThere is those extended permissions.\n\n488\n00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.870\nAnd I can see them right here.\n\n489\n00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.920\nSo I was SLFLE.\n\n490\n00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.410\nFor extended permissions or the ACL and\nwhen I change permission, so\n\n491\n00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.540\nlike Zach here he has read and write.\n\n492\n00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.200\nMaybe I change my mind and I'm like\nwell I just want Zach to have read,\n\n493\n00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.140\nI can modify these permissions from the\ncommand line it's just not easy because\n\n494\n00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.280\nall this stuff was developed for Unix and\nUnix didn't recognize these permissions.\n\n495\n00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.575\nSo if I wanna modify that you\nactually have to use chmod -a.\n\n496\n00:27:35.575 --> 00:27:39.510\nAnd -a is an attribute editor,\nyou're setting an attribute.\n\n497\n00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.370\nIt's not truly modifying ACLs.\n\n498\n00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:46.680\nSo what comes next is strange syntax,\n\n499\n00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.050\nand we have to tell it exactly how I\nwanna set this particular attribute.\n\n500\n00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:55.520\nAnd so I have to say zach Space.\n\n501\n00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.995\nAnd then, whether I'm allowing or\ndenying a permission, right?\n\n502\n00:27:59.995 --> 00:28:02.750\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So, I might want to allow him to write\n\n503\n00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:08.150\nor allow him to read, or I might want to\ndeny or remove a permission like that.\n\n504\n00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:10.300\nSo I can kinda specify what\nit is I'm trying to do.\n\n505\n00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:16.435\nSo, if I wanted to give him read and\nwrite, I would say allow read comma write.\n\n506\n00:28:16.435 --> 00:28:20.770\nLike that, and then the name of\nthe file I was giving him access to,\n\n507\n00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:25.670\nin my case the Don's novel, and so\nwhen I run that it's gonna modify\n\n508\n00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:30.660\nthose permissions and add them on or\ntake them away or set them.\n\n509\n00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:35.480\nCertainly not as easy as what\nwe saw with the GUI, right?\n\n510\n00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.460\nBut it can be done here,\nyou're just having to specify all that.\n\n511\n00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:43.250\nIn a little block here indicating\nwhat you're trying to do.\n\n512\n00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.060\nSo I can allow the permissions,\n\n513\n00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:50.160\nI can deny, before we move on,\nalso to ch mod dash a.\n\n514\n00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.410\n&gt;&gt; Is there any other data stored\nalongside the permissions?\n\n515\n00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:54.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, yes.\n\n516\n00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.940\nAnd that's where the metadata comes in.\n\n517\n00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:02.464\nSo when I did ls dash l and\nI saw that little @ symbol there.\n\n518\n00:29:02.464 --> 00:29:05.960\nThat @ symbol can tell us that\nthere's an ACL present, but\n\n519\n00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.160\nit can also tell us that\nthere's other data present.\n\n520\n00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.560\nAnd that data is normally hidden,\n\n521\n00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:16.660\nbut when I did a ls- l@,\nwe saw it for a brief moment, okay.\n\n522\n00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:20.490\nThat's additional data\nstored alongside the file.\n\n523\n00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:24.110\nAnd this data has a couple of uses.\n\n524\n00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.820\nIf you look at it,\nsome of it is really easy to see.\n\n525\n00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.750\nItem user tags, right?\n\n526\n00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.220\nIf you're messing around in the GUI,\n\n527\n00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:36.910\nyou might have noticed when I pull up a\nfile like this one, okay, here's the file.\n\n528\n00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:41.020\nAnd as you look at it, there's\ndifferent things we can set in here,\n\n529\n00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:45.910\nlike add tags, and\nI can say this is a work file, or\n\n530\n00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:49.890\nthis is a blue file, or whatever,\nyou can customize these tags.\n\n531\n00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.520\nThose tags, where do they get stored?\n\n532\n00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.470\nNot in the file,\nthat might damage the file,\n\n533\n00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:57.420\nespecially if it's like an encrypted file.\n\n534\n00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:02.000\nThis is being stored in the file system,\nit's being stored in the APFS,\n\n535\n00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.290\nor MacOS extended file system, and\nkeeping check of what tags are present.\n\n536\n00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:10.040\nSo it's got a record\nthat these tags exist and\n\n537\n00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.760\nthe basic way their being\nstored is in the meta data.\n\n538\n00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:20.220\nThere's also on some documents you'll see\nlike a little note spot here, comments.\n\n539\n00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.770\nThese are my comments.\n\n540\n00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.720\nWhere are the comments stored?\n\n541\n00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.150\nWell, same basic thing.\n\n542\n00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.990\nThese are gonna be stored\nin the file system\n\n543\n00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.200\nthat's tracking where this file goes.\n\n544\n00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.950\nThis data is present on the file.\n\n545\n00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.210\nAnd in the GUI, we see really easy.\n\n546\n00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:38.030\nBut from the command line,\nwe don't see that, right.\n\n547\n00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:41.800\nSo now when I look at this\nI see the ItemUserTags,\n\n548\n00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.170\nI see FinderInfo, lastuseddate.\n\n549\n00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.200\nThis is extra stuff.\n\n550\n00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.680\nIt's being stored.\n\n551\n00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.410\nAnd I just added a comments now there's\na new one ItemFinderComments, right?\n\n552\n00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:58.980\nAnd if I compare ItemUserTags,\nItemUserTags up here was 42 bytes in size,\n\n553\n00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.610\nnow it's 58 bytes in size\ncuz I added tags to it.\n\n554\n00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:07.660\nSo that's extra information extra meta\ndata that's attached to every file.\n\n555\n00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.440\nThe ACL is the same way.\n\n556\n00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.600\nIt's extra data attached to the file, and\nthat's why they both get that indicator\n\n557\n00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.124\nthat it will add something and let me\nknow that there's additional stuff set.\n\n558\n00:31:18.124 --> 00:31:23.040\nls-le, and ls-l@ will show that will show\nthem, or you can actually combine it all.\n\n559\n00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.400\nYou can do an ls-le@,\nif you want to go crazy.\n\n560\n00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.490\nAnd now you can see\nthe additional permissions and\n\n561\n00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.300\nthe meta data all at the same time,\nall right there.\n\n562\n00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:36.630\nThat's all being pumped out and\nall stored alongside the file.\n\n563\n00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:41.440\nNow be careful because not all\nmeta data is stored like this.\n\n564\n00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.694\nSo for example I've got a eBooks folder.\n\n565\n00:31:45.694 --> 00:31:51.208\nSomewhere and in my eBooks folder\nI go to pdf's, right, and pdf's,\n\n566\n00:31:51.208 --> 00:31:56.256\nadobe portable document format,\nthey actually have where they\n\n567\n00:31:56.256 --> 00:32:01.730\ncan store metadata in the file itself and\na lot of times they will.\n\n568\n00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.960\nSo when I look at these files.\n\n569\n00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.200\nAnd I do an ls -l, and\nI look down the line.\n\n570\n00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.330\nSee how none of them have a little\nat symbol by them, not a single one.\n\n571\n00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:14.890\nSo none of them have any\nmetadata attached to them, right?\n\n572\n00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:18.230\nBut if I browse into that folder and\n\n573\n00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:21.410\nI find one of these,\nthey definitely have metadata attached,\n\n574\n00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:25.790\nbecause I've got little pictures here,\na little rendering of what they are.\n\n575\n00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:29.976\nAnd if take one of these,\nlike iOS application security here, and\n\n576\n00:32:29.976 --> 00:32:32.610\nI do a command I on it,\nand I start to look.\n\n577\n00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:37.416\nLook all those more info right here, this\none's called iOS application security by\n\n578\n00:32:37.416 --> 00:32:41.380\nDavid Thiel, version number 1.6,\nthis is metadata.\n\n579\n00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.580\nMetadata about this document.\n\n580\n00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:48.160\nWell PDF has support for\nstoring that inside of the file.\n\n581\n00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.740\nThis is not stored in\nthe Apple file system.\n\n582\n00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.770\nBut for any document type that doesn't\nhave that functionality it's stored\n\n583\n00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.110\noutside, or any Apple proprietary stuff.\n\n584\n00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.690\nSo for example if I tag this one,\n\n585\n00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:03.220\nI'm gonna tag this one as\nan orange document, right?\n\n586\n00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:07.470\nWell, Adobe PDFs,\nthey don't know what orange tag means.\n\n587\n00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:11.840\nAnd so now if I go back here and\nI pull up my file listing, and\n\n588\n00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:17.280\nI find that iOS application\nsecurity down here at the bottom.\n\n589\n00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.200\nSee how it got the @ symbol?\n\n590\n00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.370\nThat was metadata that couldn't\nbe stored inside the document,\n\n591\n00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:25.950\nit had to be stored alongside it.\n\n592\n00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.830\nSo that's really where that stuff ends.\n\n593\n00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:32.530\nYou'll see MP4s, PDFs, couple of other\ndocuments like that that will have that,\n\n594\n00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.300\nbut everything else will\nget it stored alongside it,\n\n595\n00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.830\njust like we're seeing right here.\n\n596\n00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.020\n&gt;&gt; Can other operating\nsystems read the metadata?\n\n597\n00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:41.630\n&gt;&gt; Sort of.\n\n598\n00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.670\nThey could potentially, right?\n\n599\n00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:47.340\nMost other operating systems\ndon't have support for this, but\n\n600\n00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.580\nApple tries to be pretty friendly with it.\n\n601\n00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:53.030\nAll of this is metadata is being stored\nas part of the Apple file system.\n\n602\n00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.080\nPart of Mac OS extended journal or\npart of the APFS.\n\n603\n00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.130\nNo other operating system that\nI'm aware of bakes in support for\n\n604\n00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:00.930\nthat file system, right.\n\n605\n00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:03.780\nBut let's take my USB\ndrive here is an example.\n\n606\n00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.360\nI've got a USB hard drive, and\nit's actually formatted exFAT.\n\n607\n00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.050\nexFAT works on Windows,\nit works on Linux, it works on Macs.\n\n608\n00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.200\nIt's a very flexible format.\n\n609\n00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.380\nIt's not very resilient to failure, so\n\n610\n00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:19.410\nI don't usually like to use it but\nI did it for a reason on the show.\n\n611\n00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:23.240\nSo if I take that drive and\nI'll take that PDF,\n\n612\n00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:28.260\nthe iOS applications security one\nthat I just changed the metadata on.\n\n613\n00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.448\nRight, so it's an orange file.\n\n614\n00:34:29.448 --> 00:34:31.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna copy that and\n\n615\n00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.660\nI'll paste it over here on my USB storage,\nand see how it's still an orange file?\n\n616\n00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:44.730\nAnd if I move to that folder,\nAnd take a look.\n\n617\n00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.410\nSo I see it right there,\niOS Application Security.\n\n618\n00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:52.130\nAnd if I pull up a listing on it,\nI can see that file.\n\n619\n00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:55.380\nAnd it's got that little @\nsymbol right there on it.\n\n620\n00:34:55.380 --> 00:35:00.580\nAnd if I do an ls -l@,\nI can see that it's got ItemUserTags.\n\n621\n00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.930\nSo I know the metadata\nfolder followed it along.\n\n622\n00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:06.534\nBut here is on a non-MacOS file system.\n\n623\n00:35:06.534 --> 00:35:08.200\nHow does that work, right?\n\n624\n00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.100\nHow does another operating system\neven know to deal with this, right?\n\n625\n00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.990\nWhat's happening here is, Apple has\nwhat's called the Apple double format.\n\n626\n00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:18.310\nAnd most people wouldn't care about\nthis but it does show up on the exams.\n\n627\n00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:19.690\nMake sure you know it.\n\n628\n00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:20.960\nThe Apple double format.\n\n629\n00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:25.100\nWhere they say, look, if we're writing\na file with metadata to a file system that\n\n630\n00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:29.690\nis not an Apple file system,\nit creates a second file,\n\n631\n00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.680\na hidden file,\na file that I'm not seeing right now.\n\n632\n00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:38.350\nIf I do ls -l,\nI just see iOS Application Security.\n\n633\n00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:43.730\nI'm going to add an A, and that's gonna\nshow me all the files, even hidden ones,\n\n634\n00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:47.830\nand when I do that,\nnotice how there's a second file.\n\n635\n00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:51.650\nI've got iOS Application Security and\n\n636\n00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:57.090\nI've got ._iOS Application Security.pdf.\n\n637\n00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.850\nLooks like I've got two\ncopies of the file, right?\n\n638\n00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.760\nBut look at the sizes on them.\n\n639\n00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.960\nLet me here to get them human readable.\n\n640\n00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.080\nAnd let's look at the sizes on these.\n\n641\n00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.879\nThe iOS Application Security\npdf is 15 megabyte in size.\n\n642\n00:36:10.879 --> 00:36:13.640\nIt's a decent size for a PDF.\n\n643\n00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:18.737\nThe other one that starts with ._\nis only four kilobytes in size,\n\n644\n00:36:18.737 --> 00:36:21.310\nit just has the metadata in it.\n\n645\n00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:23.930\nSo Apple takes the metadata,\nthis file system doesn't support it,\n\n646\n00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:25.810\nputs it as an extra file there.\n\n647\n00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:30.260\nSo when another operating system, like\nif Windows or Linux were to read this,\n\n648\n00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.380\nas long as they took the time to write\nsupport for, they could read this file and\n\n649\n00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.690\nsay yeah here's the metadata,\nthis is an orange file, right.\n\n650\n00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:38.620\nBut none of them have done that so far.\n\n651\n00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.650\nSo Zach's question was,\nhow do other operating systems treat this?\n\n652\n00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:44.920\nThe short answer would have\nbeen most of them ignore it.\n\n653\n00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:49.890\nThey just ignore it, but they could at\nany time add support for it very easily,\n\n654\n00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.920\nit's just a text file, if you ever poke\naround in it it's not really, actually,\n\n655\n00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.960\nI think it's XML.\n\n656\n00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:00.390\nLet's see if we can look in here and\nfind out, no, it is a binary.\n\n657\n00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:05.010\nIt's a binary, but you can actually\nsee some of that data right here,\n\n658\n00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:08.840\nlike that item user tag\nthat we saw a moment ago.\n\n659\n00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:13.530\nAnd other information, but\nit's basically just stored in there.\n\n660\n00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:18.340\nApple publishes the format of that file,\nand so you can support it.\n\n661\n00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.260\nIt just hasn't really been done yet.\n\n662\n00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.381\n&gt;&gt; Or you can use that as nice wallpaper.\n\n663\n00:37:23.381 --> 00:37:26.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's somewhat soothing in a way.\n\n664\n00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.040\nIt's like lakes in between mountains.\n\n665\n00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.545\n&gt;&gt; I do like that.\n\n666\n00:37:29.545 --> 00:37:32.195\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; File permissions part two as promised,\n\n667\n00:37:32.195 --> 00:37:36.100\nand now file permissions part\nthree will be seen as well.\n\n668\n00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.740\nMake sure you watch all three episodes.\n\n669\n00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.000\nBefore we move on,\nDon anything else you would like to say?\n\n670\n00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\npart one was file permissions in the GUI.\n\n671\n00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.360\nPart two, this was file\npermissions from the terminal.\n\n672\n00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.570\nPart three?\n\n673\n00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.380\nWeird odds and ends, right?\n\n674\n00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.380\nThere is weird little exceptions to a lot\nof the permissions that we talked to, and\n\n675\n00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.142\njust little quirks things that\nwe needed to be aware of.\n\n676\n00:37:54.142 --> 00:37:56.470\nWe're gonna take a look\nat that in part three and\n\n677\n00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.750\nnow we wrap up our permissions odyssey.\n\n678\n00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:01.210\nBut hopefully, you've enjoyed yourself and\ndefinitely stay stay tuned for part three.\n\n679\n00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.150\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely do that.\n\n680\n00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.562\nApple certifies work professionals,\na wonderful series.\n\n681\n00:38:04.562 --> 00:38:08.470\nDon has done a lot of great work\nputting this all together for you and\n\n682\n00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:10.660\nit will help you and\nyou'll be in the course library too.\n\n683\n00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.560\nThere's thousands of\nother videos there and\n\n684\n00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.030\nthey're designed to help you go further.\n\n685\n00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.700\nCheck those out, too.\n\n686\n00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.120\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n687\n00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.860\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n688\n00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.440\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n689\n00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.290\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n690\n00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:22.780\n&gt;&gt; We will see you again very soon.\n\n691\n00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.099\n[MUSIC]\n\n692\n00:38:26.099 --> 00:38:31.641\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.221\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:10.591\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:11.537\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:11.537 --> 00:00:14.515\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching IT Pro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:16.925\nHelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:17.875\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\n\n9\n00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:20.585\nas we continue on with\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n10\n00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:22.835\nThis is File Permissions part three.\n\n11\n00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:26.545\nWe promised you there would be\na part three, and we are there.\n\n12\n00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:28.215\nAnd Don Pezet's gonna help us out again.\n\n13\n00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:30.000\nThank you, Don.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thank you for\n\n14\n00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.730\nhaving me back, Zach.\n\n15\n00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.850\nSo to quickly recap, in part one we got\nto see permissions through the GUI,\n\n16\n00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.660\nand we've built up our rebel alliance.\n\n17\n00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.640\nIn part two, we saw permissions from the\ncommand line, and unfortunately the empire\n\n18\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.581\nwas winning at the end of that one.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:45.855\n&gt;&gt; So here in part three,\n\n20\n00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:48.950\nwe're gonna see special,\nunexpected permissions.\n\n21\n00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.230\nAnd this is our chance to let the Jedis\nwin and save the day and all that.\n\n22\n00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.660\nSo that's all right here in this episode.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n23\n00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.645\nwhich default permissions do\nwe need to watch out for, Don?\n\n24\n00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:01.025\nAll right, so-\n&gt;&gt; Those storm troopers.\n\n25\n00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:03.950\n&gt;&gt; The default storm troopers.\n\n26\n00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.585\nSo there are permissions set\n\n27\n00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:06.925\nall throughout the file system.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n28\n00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:08.995\n&gt;&gt; And some of them you might expect,\n\n29\n00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:11.455\nsome of them fall within\nthis kinda default setting.\n\n30\n00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:13.435\nBut there is a lot of variation.\n\n31\n00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:18.310\nAnd so, I wanna highlight some of\nthe weird ones that are there by default.\n\n32\n00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.650\nWhich technically makes them not weird,\nthe default permissions, but\n\n33\n00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.400\nthey're just not what you would expect.\n\n34\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.560\nAnd one of the best places to highlight\nthis is with the user's home directory.\n\n35\n00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.500\nThe directories that we would think would\nbe the most sacrosanct, or isolated, or\n\n36\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.240\nwhatever, they're not.\n\n37\n00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.010\nAnd let me show you what I mean.\n\n38\n00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.260\nI'm gonna drop to terminal\ncuz it's a little faster for\n\n39\n00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.530\nme to show this in the terminal,\neven though normally we'd wanna use GUI.\n\n40\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.090\nBut if you go into the /Users folder,\nand you take a look at the permissions.\n\n41\n00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.750\nNow, I know that I have a folder and\n\n42\n00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.990\nyou have a folder Zach.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n43\n00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.900\n&gt;&gt; So we would think that I wouldn't\n\n44\n00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.870\nhave access to Zach's folder and\nZach wouldn't have access to my folder.\n\n45\n00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.360\nThat's what you would think.\n\n46\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.870\nBut if you look at the default\npermissions, with Zach,\n\n47\n00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.570\neveryone has read and\nexecute on his folder.\n\n48\n00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.000\nAnd me, everyone has read and\nexecute on my folder.\n\n49\n00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.480\nWhat is that all about?\n\n50\n00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.230\nWhy would we want everyone to be\nable to get into our folder, right?\n\n51\n00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.530\nAnd this is why it's important to\nunderstand default permissions.\n\n52\n00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.610\nI did not change either of these.\n\n53\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.570\nThese are the default permissions set\n\n54\n00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.030\nby Apple.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n55\n00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.470\n&gt;&gt; The reason it's like that is inside of\n\n56\n00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.600\nyour folder, so now,\nI'm in /users/dpezet$.\n\n57\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.290\nIf I look at the folders in there,\nall right, well, I've got applications,\n\n58\n00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.020\ndesktop, documents, down loads.\n\n59\n00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.270\nThose are all normal folders\nthat Apple created for me, and\n\n60\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.851\nif you look at the permissions,\nnow it's what I expect, right?\n\n61\n00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:53.980\nOnly I can get into my documents folder,\nand I have read, write, and execute.\n\n62\n00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.930\nEverybody else has nothing, right?\n\n63\n00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.706\nThat's what I expect.\n\n64\n00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:01.710\nSame thing with picture.\nSame thing with library.\n\n65\n00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.530\nSo if that's protected, why give\neveryone access to this home folder?\n\n66\n00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.030\nAnd it's all because of this\nfolder right here, Public.\n\n67\n00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.810\nIn every home folder there's a folder\ncalled Public, and it's designed so\n\n68\n00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.680\nthat if I had a document I wanted\neverybody to see, I want everybody to be\n\n69\n00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.500\nable to read my novel, that was\nwhat I used in the first two parts.\n\n70\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.010\nIf I want everybody to read my novel,\nI could just drop it in my Public folder.\n\n71\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.920\nAnd anybody who has a user account on my\ncomputer can browse into it and get at it.\n\n72\n00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.960\nOr if I'm using shared folders,\nthey could browse over the network and\n\n73\n00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.750\ngo right into my Public folder and\nsee that document.\n\n74\n00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.350\nThat lets me, the user,\ncontrol that access.\n\n75\n00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.480\nSo when I want that document to be public,\n\n76\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.650\ninstead of putting it into my Documents\nfolder, I just put it in my Public folder.\n\n77\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.910\nAny end user can do that, it doesn't\ntake a rocket scientist to see him.\n\n78\n00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.460\nFolder is called Public.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n79\n00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.180\n&gt;&gt; So why am I making a big deal\n\n80\n00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.160\nout of that right now?\n\n81\n00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.540\nWell, if you know what you're doing, and\n\n82\n00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.700\nyou put your documents in the right place,\nthis works great.\n\n83\n00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.740\nBut if you don't know what you're doing,\nlet's say that I'm a user and hey,\n\n84\n00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.370\nI've added my Home folder\nto the sidebar here, right?\n\n85\n00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.010\nSo I start taking documents like my novel,\nand only I should have access to my novel,\n\n86\n00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.480\nit's my novel.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n87\n00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.310\n&gt;&gt; But I drop it here,\n\n88\n00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.810\nwhere is my novel these days?\n\n89\n00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.850\nThere we go.\n\n90\n00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.930\nSo I'm gonna take my novel, and\nI'm just gonna drop it in my home folder.\n\n91\n00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.200\nHey, it's my home folder.\n\n92\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.040\nI can put it there if I want to, right?\n\n93\n00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.630\nYou can.\n\n94\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.530\nBut the default permissions\nto that folder,\n\n95\n00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.270\nremember, everyone has read access.\n\n96\n00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.240\nSo by dropping something in here,\neverybody is going to have access to it.\n\n97\n00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.800\nIf I put it in the documents folder,\nnow only I have access to it, right?\n\n98\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.900\nSo users can make mistakes.\n\n99\n00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.640\nAnd not just users.\n\n100\n00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.170\nI have third party software installed,\nright?\n\n101\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.480\nAJA mini-config, right?\n\n102\n00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.430\nThat's from a company,\noddly enough, called AJA.\n\n103\n00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.880\nAnd when they created that folder with\ntheir application that was installed,\n\n104\n00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.535\nif you look at the permissions, well,\nit's set where everyone has access to it.\n\n105\n00:05:08.535 --> 00:05:09.730\nSay if they were resiliosync,\n\n106\n00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.330\na little synchronization program I use,\neveryone has access to it.\n\n107\n00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.570\nThat's not good.\n\n108\n00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.710\nThose developers,\nwhoever wrote that software,\n\n109\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.460\ndidn't realize the mistake they\nwere making when they did that.\n\n110\n00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.910\nThey just said, we'll put it in\nthe home folder, it'll be fine.\n\n111\n00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.540\nThat's not what they should have done.\n\n112\n00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.910\nTheir data should be either\ngoing into the Library folder or\n\n113\n00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.890\ninto the Documents folder.\n\n114\n00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.470\nIt should be going into one of those.\n\n115\n00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.010\nI have VMware Fusion installed,\nand it makes virtual machines.\n\n116\n00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:40.340\nAnd it's putting those\ninto my Documents folder.\n\n117\n00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.190\nSo inside of Documents, there's\na folder called Virtual Machines, and\n\n118\n00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.560\nthat's where my virtual\nmachines are being stored.\n\n119\n00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.310\nAnd that's what you want.\n\n120\n00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.070\nBecause now the permissions are set right.\n\n121\n00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.380\nNot every developer seems to understand\nthis, and you end up with documents and\n\n122\n00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.000\nthings that are in the wrong spot.\n\n123\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.290\nSo we need to know those permissions.\n\n124\n00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.970\nUnderstand that your Home folder is\nnot as private as you might think.\n\n125\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.430\nThe default permissions on that\nfolder are unusual, right?\n\n126\n00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.380\nEverything needs to go\ninto the subfolders.\n\n127\n00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.280\nThe subfolders are protected properly.\n\n128\n00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.780\nNow, if you don't use the Public folder,\nwhich really I don't, I could go and\n\n129\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.590\nchange the default permissions here,\nand say you know what,\n\n130\n00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.880\nI'm gonna make it where only\nI can get into that folder.\n\n131\n00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.920\nThat makes sense.\n\n132\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.900\nI don't use Public anyway,\nlet me shut that off.\n\n133\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.520\nYou can do that, right?\n\n134\n00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.200\nBut it's not done that way by default.\n\n135\n00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.980\nSo just be aware, and\n\n136\n00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.550\nnotice how a lot of these folders have\na little plus sign beside them or\n\n137\n00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.900\nan at symbol, which is what lets us know\nthere's extra information attached to it.\n\n138\n00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.679\nSo if I take a look, if I do an ls.\n\n139\n00:06:45.316 --> 00:06:47.640\nLs -le, there we go.\n\n140\n00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.020\nIf I do an ls-le and I start to take a\nlook at some of these, look at Documents,\n\n141\n00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.017\nfor example, right?\n\n142\n00:06:52.017 --> 00:06:57.240\nNot only is it set so\nthat only I have read, write, and execute.\n\n143\n00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.190\nThey group everyone as deny delete.\n\n144\n00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.350\nIt's like a fail safe that if they\nfind some other way to get in there,\n\n145\n00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.540\nthey still won't be able to delete things,\nright?\n\n146\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.460\nSo it's kind of protecting\nthat information.\n\n147\n00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.050\nSo there's permissions like\nthese that are hidden away,\n\n148\n00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.750\nand if we don't know about them, we can\nend up with behavior that's unexpected.\n\n149\n00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.940\nAnd your average end-user,\nthey'll never see this.\n\n150\n00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.380\nThey won't even know this is happening\nbecause it doesn't necessarily get\n\n151\n00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.545\nrepresented very well in the GUI.\n\n152\n00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.480\nIn the GUI,\nthey would have to pull up every folder.\n\n153\n00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.680\nThey will have to say, well,\nlet me look at documents.\n\n154\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.900\nOkay, and I'm gonna come in here and,\nlook at that.\n\n155\n00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.393\nI have read and write,\neverybody else no access.\n\n156\n00:07:34.393 --> 00:07:39.320\nOkay, well, let me go take a look at\nAJA mini config, and come in here,\n\n157\n00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.320\nand wait a minute,\nthat doesn't look right.\n\n158\n00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.888\nHow many end users are gonna do that?\n\n159\n00:07:45.057 --> 00:07:46.140\nZero, right?\n\n160\n00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.580\nSo as a support professional,\nwe need to do that.\n\n161\n00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.269\nWe need to be the ones stepping in and\nsaying these\n\n162\n00:07:51.269 --> 00:07:55.481\npermissions are not necessarily secure\nenough if this is a shared machine.\n\n163\n00:07:55.481 --> 00:07:59.652\nIf it's a dedicated machine, if I'm\nthe only user using this system, then it's\n\n164\n00:07:59.652 --> 00:08:03.350\nprobably okay, well, which I guess in\nmy case I am the only one using it.\n\n165\n00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.646\nBut I created a user account for Zach.\n\n166\n00:08:05.646 --> 00:08:07.673\nZach could log in on this laptop.\n\n167\n00:08:07.673 --> 00:08:09.270\nHe's got a valid user account.\n\n168\n00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:13.390\nHe could browse to my folder, and\nthen he could browse into ResilioSync,\n\n169\n00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.730\nwhere I synchronize a ton of my documents,\nmy stuff, and\n\n170\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.320\nhe would have access to all of it.\n\n171\n00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.231\nI might not want that.\nThat would be an unintentional granting\n\n172\n00:08:22.231 --> 00:08:23.780\nof permissions.\n\n173\n00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.350\nJust because either I didn't\nunderstand the permissions, or\n\n174\n00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.790\nthe people at ResilioSync\ndon't know the permissions.\n\n175\n00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.440\nOr AJA and so on.\n\n176\n00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.800\nAnd honestly, now that I've said it,\n\n177\n00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.790\nI should probably send them\na bug report or something.\n\n178\n00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.752\nThey might just not know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n179\n00:08:37.752 --> 00:08:38.844\n&gt;&gt; But that happens.\n\n180\n00:08:38.844 --> 00:08:42.420\nIt's an unusual thing, but it does happen.\n&gt;&gt; Are there\n\n181\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.320\nany other folders with unusual problems?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a few.\n\n182\n00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.650\nLet me highlight a few more.\n\n183\n00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.810\nSo I focused on the home directory there,\nright?\n\n184\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.060\nLet’s go a little deeper.\n\n185\n00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.180\nThat Public folder that I mentioned.\n\n186\n00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.370\nInside of the Public folder,\nthere's a folder called Dropbox.\n\n187\n00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.810\nNow, anything that I put in the Public\nfolder, everybody will have access to.\n\n188\n00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.680\nThey'll be able to read it.\n\n189\n00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.150\nDropbox is different, though.\n\n190\n00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.830\nRemember, we talked about\nDropbox permissions in part two.\n\n191\n00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.130\nThis where people have write only.\n\n192\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.811\nActually, I guess it was part\none that we talked about it.\n\n193\n00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:16.800\nWhere people can put files in there, but\nthey can't see them, or get things out.\n\n194\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.260\nSo lets say I wanted to give\na copy of my novel to Zach.\n\n195\n00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.690\nI want Zach to be able to\nsee that novel and whatever.\n\n196\n00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.910\nSo I come in here, I get my novel.\n\n197\n00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:25.697\nGonna copy that.\n\n198\n00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:27.370\nOr here, I'll park it to the side.\n\n199\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.460\nAnd then, over here, I'm gonna browse,\nand here's Zach's folder.\n\n200\n00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.560\nNow, I'm not logged in as Zach, and I am\nan administrator, but if I do something\n\n201\n00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.580\nthat requires administrative privileges,\nit's gonna prompt me for it, right?\n\n202\n00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.340\nSo, I'm just a regular\nJoe Schmoe user right now.\n\n203\n00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.270\nI browse into Zach's folder.\n\n204\n00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.880\nSee how all his folders have the red\ncircle with a white line through\n\n205\n00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.890\nthem?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n206\n00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.390\n&gt;&gt; That's because I don't have permission.\n\n207\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.850\nI can't see Zach's Movies and\nMusic and Downloads and Documents.\n\n208\n00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.180\nThat's the way things should be.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n209\n00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.390\nactually, that's what I meant,\ntoo Don, is unusual permissions.\n\n210\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.970\nI did say the word problems, but unusual\npermissions was the other thing I was\n\n211\n00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.620\nlooking for, too.\n&gt;&gt; You are accurate, though.\n\n212\n00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.870\nThey're unusual problems.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n213\n00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.860\n&gt;&gt; So when I see these folders here,\n\n214\n00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.620\nI can't get at them.\n\n215\n00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.570\nThat's good.\nIf I try and\n\n216\n00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.830\nget to Zach's pictures, I can't, right?\n\n217\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.770\nBut I can get to Public.\n\n218\n00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.510\nAnd if he had anything in here,\n\n219\n00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.450\nI would be able to see it.\n&gt;&gt; That would be a problem.\n\n220\n00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.139\n&gt;&gt; And I see Drop,\n\n221\n00:10:21.139 --> 00:10:24.550\nwell it's not necessarily a problem\ncuz this is the Public folder, right?\n\n222\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.630\nThat's what we expect.\n\n223\n00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.508\nBut the AJA mini-configure or\n\n224\n00:10:27.508 --> 00:10:29.920\nResilioSync, that would be a problem.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n225\n00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.350\n&gt;&gt; Drop Box, I see it, and\n\n226\n00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.690\nit's got that little down arrow.\n\n227\n00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.150\nThat's the hint that lets me\nknow this is a Drop Box, and\n\n228\n00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.540\nif I take a look in there,\nI can't open it.\n\n229\n00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.980\nI don't have read permissions.\n\n230\n00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:47.280\nI can take my novel and I can drag and\ndrop it and plop it right in there.\n\n231\n00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.150\nAnd it's gonna warn me,\nyou can put items in a Drop Box, but\n\n232\n00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.060\nyou won't be able to see them.\n\n233\n00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.350\nDo you want to continue?\n\n234\n00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:58.200\nI'll say okay, and\nit's gonna copy my novel in there, okay?\n\n235\n00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.640\nNow, did it do it?\n\n236\n00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.420\nDid it succeed?\n\n237\n00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.300\nI don't know.\n\n238\n00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.940\nI don't have read permissions,\nI can't figure it out.\n\n239\n00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.680\nIf I try and open that up, I can't.\n\n240\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.340\nI only had write permissions.\n\n241\n00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.759\nAnd from the terminal, we can spot that,\n\n242\n00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:18.757\nif I go into, let me do a,\nI'm gonna cheat a little bit here.\n\n243\n00:11:18.757 --> 00:11:22.660\nI'm gonna bump up to a route account so\npermissions won't apply to me anymore.\n\n244\n00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.570\nYou don't normally want to do that.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n245\n00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.740\n&gt;&gt; But I'm gonna do it so\n\n246\n00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.930\nI can break into Zach's account.\n&gt;&gt; Please do.\n\n247\n00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.893\n&gt;&gt; I guess I could have just logged\n\n248\n00:11:28.893 --> 00:11:29.454\nin as you, Zach.\n\n249\n00:11:29.454 --> 00:11:30.886\nThat would have been easier.\n&gt;&gt; You could have.\n\n250\n00:11:30.886 --> 00:11:34.763\n&gt;&gt; But when I go into Zach's folder here,\n\n251\n00:11:34.763 --> 00:11:40.518\nand I look at the Public folder,\nI can see that it's open so\n\n252\n00:11:40.518 --> 00:11:45.240\nthat everybody can kind of get into it.\n\n253\n00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.260\nAnd when I go into Public,\nI can see that Drop Box folder, and\n\n254\n00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.070\nI can see the write only\npermissions that are set.\n\n255\n00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.790\nNo read, just write.\n\n256\n00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.200\nAnd if I go into that,\nthere's Don's novel sitting right there.\n\n257\n00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.075\nAnd if I look at the permissions on\nDon's novel, well, Zach has read,\n\n258\n00:12:08.075 --> 00:12:09.720\nwrite, and execute.\n\n259\n00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.250\nOr does he?\n\n260\n00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.840\nDpezet is the user.\n\n261\n00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.310\nI'm the user, I made the thing, right?\n\n262\n00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.680\nI have read and write,\n\n263\n00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.320\nbut I can't actually read it\nbecause I can't get to that folder.\n\n264\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.110\nAnd then the group is staff.\n\n265\n00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.950\nZach is in that group, so\nhe has read permissions and\n\n266\n00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.120\neverybody else has nothing.\n\n267\n00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.717\nAnd then it has a little at symbol by it\nto let me know there's a little bit more\n\n268\n00:12:28.717 --> 00:12:29.850\nattached to this one.\n\n269\n00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.710\nI don't think there's extended\npermissions though, I think.\n\n270\n00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.600\nNo, there is.\n\n271\n00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.020\nSo if I look at the extended\npermissions on that one,\n\n272\n00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.620\nI can see other permissions\nthat came along with that file,\n\n273\n00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:42.960\nincluding permissions that are allowing\nZach to read, write, and execute.\n\n274\n00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.120\nSo he has full access.\n\n275\n00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.390\nThat file's in his folder.\n\n276\n00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.160\nHe should have full access,\nand he does right here.\n\n277\n00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.490\nSo that's another example of one\nthat's a little weird and unusual.\n\n278\n00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.410\nA similar folder to that\nis the shared folder.\n\n279\n00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:03.280\nNow, I've gone into this\n/users folder a few times.\n\n280\n00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.950\nAnd every time that I've come in here,\nI've sent us to an actual user.\n\n281\n00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.960\nSo like dpezet or zach or whatever.\n\n282\n00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.280\nBut there's another folder\nhere called shared, all right?\n\n283\n00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.440\nShared is not a user.\n\n284\n00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.100\nIf I take a look at the shared folder,\n\n285\n00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.050\nthe owner is root.\n&gt;&gt; Who is root?\n\n286\n00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.560\nThat's the Unix administrator, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the admin.\n\n287\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.469\n&gt;&gt; The full blown overall, yeah, right,\n\n288\n00:13:26.469 --> 00:13:27.830\nthe admin account.\n\n289\n00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:32.812\nSo nobody logs in as root, but\nthere it is, it's that's the account.\n\n290\n00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:38.974\nNow, that account is holding this folder,\nand the folder's permissions.\n\n291\n00:13:38.974 --> 00:13:43.550\nEverybody has read, write,\nand execute, right?\n\n292\n00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.190\nIf I wanna work on the novel with Zach and\nwith five other people, and I want\n\n293\n00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.670\neverybody to be able to read and write to\nit, I can stick it in the Shared folder.\n\n294\n00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.210\nAnd when it's in the Shared folder,\nanybody who has an account on this\n\n295\n00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.200\ncomputer will be able to browse\nright in there and mess with it.\n\n296\n00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.540\nThis is shared across all\nthe user accounts in this system.\n\n297\n00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.010\nAny user can browse to it.\n\n298\n00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:02.940\nIt's kind of convenient.\n\n299\n00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.890\nI think it's actually inside\nthe sidebar by default, isn't it?\n\n300\n00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.400\nMaybe not.\nYeah, I don't see it in the sidebar.\n\n301\n00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.120\nBut you can browse to it\njust like anything else,\n\n302\n00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:18.105\nby browsing to your computer and\ngoing into Users and Shared.\n\n303\n00:14:18.105 --> 00:14:21.990\nAnd if you've been doing stuff in here,\nyou can always pin it to your sidebar and\n\n304\n00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.230\nthen you've got access to it.\n\n305\n00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.570\nBut anybody can drop stuff in here and\nstart to use it, and they'll see it.\n\n306\n00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:32.850\nSo it's a convenient folder to have,\nbut the permissions on it are bizarre.\n\n307\n00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.050\nLet me show you what I mean by bizarre.\n\n308\n00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.625\nWhen I look at the permissions,\nif you remember back in part two,\n\n309\n00:14:38.625 --> 00:14:42.655\nI said there were really just three\nletters we needed to remember, r, w,\n\n310\n00:14:42.655 --> 00:14:43.425\nand x.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n311\n00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:44.720\n&gt;&gt; Read, write, and execute.\n\n312\n00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.070\nI've got rwxrwxrwt.\n\n313\n00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:52.990\nt, what the heck's that?\n\n314\n00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.290\nSo here's this weird letter\nthat just pops out of nowhere.\n\n315\n00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:57.820\nNot a plus sign, right?\n\n316\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.840\nRemember, when there's a plus sign,\n\n317\n00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.830\nthat means we have an ACL,\nwe have extended information on this.\n\n318\n00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.510\nOr an at sign means we got metadata or\nwe might have metadata and an ACL.\n\n319\n00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.190\nWith an at sign it can be either one.\n\n320\n00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.900\nBut here, it's a t, the letter t.\n\n321\n00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.260\nThat t is what's called the sticky bit.\n\n322\n00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.610\nAnd the sticky bit, it's a weird name.\n\n323\n00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.420\nIt's designed for\nshared folders like these.\n\n324\n00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.120\nThe way a sticky bit works is it says,\nlook, everybody can get into this folder.\n\n325\n00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.890\nAnd everybody can read and write.\n\n326\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:30.090\nBut when you create a document,\nif the folder has the sticky bit set,\n\n327\n00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:35.940\nyou will be the owner of that document,\nand only you can delete your document.\n\n328\n00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.210\nOther people can read it,\nother people can write to it,\n\n329\n00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.130\nbut they can't delete it, right?\n\n330\n00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:45.650\nThis is a way to help us protect\nour documents in a shared folder.\n\n331\n00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.690\nThis sticky bit cannot be set from\nthe graphical user interface,\n\n332\n00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.091\nit's just not there.\n\n333\n00:15:51.091 --> 00:15:55.636\nAnd on the hard drive, to my knowledge,\nthe only place that the sticky bit by\n\n334\n00:15:55.636 --> 00:16:00.266\ndefault is this folder right here,\nthe shared folder, so /user/shared.\n\n335\n00:16:00.266 --> 00:16:03.760\nI believe that's the only place in all\nof MacOS where it's set by default.\n\n336\n00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.570\nNow we can set it.\n\n337\n00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.812\nYou can drop in the command line and\ndo a CH mod.\n\n338\n00:16:07.812 --> 00:16:15.460\nWhen we were adding read or write or\nexecute, we did plus r, plus w, plus x.\n\n339\n00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.020\nYou can do plus t.\n\n340\n00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.950\nAnd that adds the sticky bit.\n\n341\n00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.280\nSo you can turn it on yourself if you have\na need for a custom folder that does this.\n\n342\n00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.472\nBut most people don't even have a need for\nthis folder,\n\n343\n00:16:23.472 --> 00:16:25.320\nbetter yet, a custom folder that does it.\n\n344\n00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.210\nBut that's the sticky bit,\nit's a weird permission.\n\n345\n00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.640\nIt's one that could pop up.\n\n346\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.960\nAnd if you find that you've\ngot some shared folder and\n\n347\n00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.560\nusers are able to use it,\nread and write or whatever.\n\n348\n00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.590\nBut some users can delete files and\nother users can't.\n\n349\n00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.470\nAnd you're scratching your head trying\nto figure out why can't Zach delete\n\n350\n00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.070\nthis file?\n\n351\n00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.240\nHe's got read, write, and execute.\n\n352\n00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.288\nIf the folder has the sticky bit set,\nyou can only delete files that you own.\n\n353\n00:16:49.288 --> 00:16:50.750\nYou have to be the you,\n\n354\n00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.770\nthe user, attached to that file, otherwise\nyou won't be able to delete them.\n\n355\n00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.480\nThat's the purpose of the sticky bit.\n\n356\n00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.480\nIt's kind of a bizarre one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sticky situation indeed, yeah.\n\n357\n00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.370\nWell, what do we do if\nthe permissions get messed up?\n\n358\n00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, now in part two\n\n359\n00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.550\nI showed how to use the chmod\ncommand with -r to be recursive.\n\n360\n00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.648\nSo we could reset\npermissions across folders.\n\n361\n00:17:11.648 --> 00:17:15.750\nBut that requires us to know\nwhat the permissions should be.\n\n362\n00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.790\nIf somebody's royally hosed up\nthe permissions on their system, and\n\n363\n00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.640\nthey can't get logged in any more and\nthings are just really,\n\n364\n00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.470\nreally bad, you might not know\nall the default permissions,\n\n365\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.660\nespecially the weird ones\nlike I just showed you.\n\n366\n00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.820\nSo fortunately, Apple gives us\nan easy way to fix that, and\n\n367\n00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.280\nit's through disk utility.\n\n368\n00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.480\nSo if Zach calls me up and says, Don,\nI've really done a job on this one.\n\n369\n00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.220\nI can't even get logged in any more.\n\n370\n00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.080\nMy home folder's completely locked up.\n\n371\n00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.820\nI can't get at my data.\n\n372\n00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.970\nWell, I could log in with\nan administrative account, and here,\n\n373\n00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.720\nlet me show you what we do.\n\n374\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.380\nWe can launch the disk utility,\nso I'll just use Spotlight, and\n\n375\n00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.800\npull up disk utility.\n\n376\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.684\nYou can pick the drive that has\nthe borched permissions on it.\n\n377\n00:17:54.684 --> 00:17:59.180\nAnd then up top,\nyou've got a button for First Aid.\n\n378\n00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.840\nNow First Aid actually does two things.\n\n379\n00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.530\nIt looks for physical errors\non the disk and it looks for\n\n380\n00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.740\npermissions errors on the disk.\n\n381\n00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.650\nAnd it'll go through and\nreset those permissions and\n\n382\n00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.750\nget it put back the way\nthat it needs to be.\n\n383\n00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.416\nSo that's a great way to\nfix those permissions.\n\n384\n00:18:15.416 --> 00:18:16.553\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n385\n00:18:16.553 --> 00:18:17.555\n&gt;&gt; Assuming you're able\n\n386\n00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:18.210\nto log in.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n387\n00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.980\n&gt;&gt; Right, so if Zack had the only user\n\n388\n00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.600\naccount, and he's totally locked out,\nthat doesn't work so well, right?\n\n389\n00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.460\nSo then what we would have\nto do is boot to recovery.\n\n390\n00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.910\nAnd if you boot to recovery,\nthen you can go in, use a disk utility and\n\n391\n00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.160\nrun First Aid.\n\n392\n00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.510\nIf that's even messed up, if he's\nreally done a royal job on this system,\n\n393\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.400\nthen you might need to boot\nto Internet recovery, or\n\n394\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.660\nworst case scenario,\nyou could boot to target mode, right?\n\n395\n00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.830\nAnd we talked about target mode\non the troubleshooting episode.\n\n396\n00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:46.720\nSo basically,\n\n397\n00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.630\nif you boot a MAC up while holding the\nletter T on the keyboard, it will boot in\n\n398\n00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:55.550\nthe target mode where your system\nbecomes one giant removable hard drive.\n\n399\n00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:59.090\nAnd you can run a Thunderbolt or\na FireWire cable from your Mac to another\n\n400\n00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.310\nMac, and the other Mac will\njust see you as a hard drive.\n\n401\n00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.830\nAnd you can use their disk\nutility to go through and\n\n402\n00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.610\nrepair the permissions and it'll fix it.\n\n403\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.837\nSo several different ways to go\nabout that to get it repaired.\n\n404\n00:19:09.837 --> 00:19:12.320\nBut it does happen.\n\n405\n00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.770\nDisk utility is certainly\nthe easiest way to fix it.\n\n406\n00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.560\nAre our permissions handled the same\nway on an external storage then?\n\n407\n00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:19.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes and no.\n\n408\n00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.130\nSo for the most part, yes.\n\n409\n00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:25.490\nIf I have an external drive,\nright, so here I actually, whoops,\n\n410\n00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:30.815\nburied in my 8000 windows, somewhere\nin here I've got this USB storage.\n\n411\n00:19:30.815 --> 00:19:32.490\nOkay, so here's some USB storage.\n\n412\n00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.490\nI've got a copy of my novel and\nsome other things that are on here.\n\n413\n00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:40.580\nAnd when I take a look at my novel, and\nI look at the permissions on it, I've got,\n\n414\n00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:45.180\nI'm the owner, dpezet, admin is\nthe group right now for whatever reason.\n\n415\n00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.850\nEveryone is given no access.\n\n416\n00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.170\nZach, you have read and write.\n\n417\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.760\nNovelEditors have read and write.\n\n418\n00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.160\nAnd that's all stored\non a removable drive.\n\n419\n00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.310\nRight, there's that external\ndrive sitting right there.\n\n420\n00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.450\nAnd so I'm able to set those permissions.\n\n421\n00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.360\nWell, that's assuming it has\nan Apple file system, right?\n\n422\n00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.115\nSo mine is formatted,\nmine should be MacOS extended journal.\n\n423\n00:20:05.115 --> 00:20:06.565\nYou might have an APFS.\n\n424\n00:20:06.565 --> 00:20:10.893\nIf it's exFAT, right, exFAT is really\ncompatible, works with a number of OSs,\n\n425\n00:20:10.893 --> 00:20:13.085\nexFAT does not support permissions.\n\n426\n00:20:13.085 --> 00:20:14.775\nSo you'd have no permissions on that disk.\n\n427\n00:20:14.775 --> 00:20:17.354\nEverybody would have\nfull access to that disk.\n\n428\n00:20:17.354 --> 00:20:19.711\nThat's why it's so\nimportant to encrypt our disks.\n\n429\n00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:23.903\nBut in this case, it's an Apple file\nsystem so I have real permissions,\n\n430\n00:20:23.903 --> 00:20:24.599\nall right?\n\n431\n00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:27.630\nBut there's one little problem.\n\n432\n00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.560\nThis is a removable drive.\n\n433\n00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:34.310\nSo if I eject it and I give to Zach and\nZach plugs it into his computer,\n\n434\n00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.510\nit's gonna look at these permissions and\nwhat is it gonna find?\n\n435\n00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.750\nWell, it's gonna find this list down here.\n\n436\n00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:45.550\nThis list is groups and\nusers that are on my computer.\n\n437\n00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.270\nAre they on his computer?\n\n438\n00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.420\nWell, Zach probably is,\nright, but NovelEditors?\n\n439\n00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.560\nThat group doesn't exist on his computer.\n\n440\n00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.610\nThe user, dpezet, that's me.\n\n441\n00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.950\nI don't exist on his computer, unless\nyou've made an account I don't know about.\n\n442\n00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.070\nSo these don't exist\non the other computer.\n\n443\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:05.530\nSo when you plug into another system,\ndo these permissions work?\n\n444\n00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:07.610\nNot necessarily.\n\n445\n00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.830\nYou can have a lot of problems with that.\n\n446\n00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.180\nSo when you've got removable media,\n\n447\n00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.770\nsometimes those permissions\nare getting ignored, all right?\n\n448\n00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.027\nAnd I don't see it,\nlet me unlock this real quick.\n\n449\n00:21:20.027 --> 00:21:25.453\nA lot of times what will happen is when\nyou plug in a removable drive, and it was\n\n450\n00:21:25.453 --> 00:21:31.237\nset up in another computer, well, this one\nwas set up in my computer, so I see it.\n\n451\n00:21:31.237 --> 00:21:36.576\nIf it was set up in another computer,\nthere'll actually be, at the bottom\n\n452\n00:21:36.576 --> 00:21:42.860\nof the screen, a little check mark that\nsays, ignore ownership on this drive.\n\n453\n00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:47.530\nIf it's a removable drive, and\nthe system knows it, then it says, hey,\n\n454\n00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.750\nthe owner doesn't really\nmean anything to me.\n\n455\n00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:50.862\nLet's just ignore it.\n\n456\n00:21:50.862 --> 00:21:53.210\nAnd so that gets treated differently.\n\n457\n00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:57.330\nLet me take this disk, and\nI'm just gonna format it.\n\n458\n00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:58.900\nI'll format it exFAT.\n\n459\n00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.885\nIf I format it exFAT, the system will\nknow that it can't trust the disk, so\n\n460\n00:22:02.885 --> 00:22:05.830\nI'm just gonna format that real quick.\n\n461\n00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.380\nAnd once I do that, there we go.\n\n462\n00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:08.970\nSo that's done.\n\n463\n00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:14.310\nI'll pull up the permissions\non that disk and, shoot,\n\n464\n00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.177\nit's gonna tell me I have custom access.\n\n465\n00:22:17.177 --> 00:22:19.754\n[SOUND] Just told me I have custom access.\n\n466\n00:22:19.754 --> 00:22:23.157\nBut if this disk were formatted in some\nother computer and I bring it over here,\n\n467\n00:22:23.157 --> 00:22:26.560\nI would just see that checkpoint\nthat says ignore ownership.\n\n468\n00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.686\nWhat that's really trying\nto tell you is hey,\n\n469\n00:22:28.686 --> 00:22:31.880\nsending permissions on a removable drive,\nthat's great and\n\n470\n00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.390\nall, but they don't mean anything.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n471\n00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:35.360\n&gt;&gt; They're pointless.\n\n472\n00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.180\nIt's pointless to have permissions on a\nremovable disk because the moment you plug\n\n473\n00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.370\nit into another computer,\nthey all get ignored anyway, right?\n\n474\n00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.780\nSo how do we fix that?\n\n475\n00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.580\nOn removable media it is\nsuper mega ultra double\n\n476\n00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:55.600\nsecret provision important to make\nsure that you encrypt the disc.\n\n477\n00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.536\nIf it's encrypted, now nobody has\naccess to the disc at all unless they\n\n478\n00:23:00.536 --> 00:23:03.020\ncan unlock the disc.\n&gt;&gt; If they have the key.\n\n479\n00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.004\n&gt;&gt; If they have the key to\n\n480\n00:23:04.004 --> 00:23:05.030\nunlock it, right.\n\n481\n00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.020\nThat's how you protect removable media.\n\n482\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.980\nFile permissions,\nthat doesn't work, right?\n\n483\n00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.910\nMaybe if this was a server, right?\n\n484\n00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:16.500\nSo maybe I had a Mac Mini with a bunch of\nUSB drives stuck in a closet somewhere,\n\n485\n00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.020\nI might set permissions, cuz people are\ncoming in over the network to access it.\n\n486\n00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:24.280\nBut if other people have physical access\nto the disk, the permissions are useless.\n\n487\n00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:28.560\nSo on removable media,\nwe don't normally worry too much about it.\n\n488\n00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.460\nAnd then we just make sure to secure it\na different way, like doing encryption.\n\n489\n00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.700\nIt's easy enough to do.\n\n490\n00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.860\nThat's the way you protect it.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic,\n\n491\n00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.390\nwell, file permissions part three.\n\n492\n00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.010\nMake sure you see parts one and two.\n\n493\n00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:40.177\nAnd before you move on, Don,\n\n494\n00:23:40.177 --> 00:23:43.428\nI know you wanna say something else.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There is a little bit more in\n\n495\n00:23:43.428 --> 00:23:48.164\nthe troubleshooting world that we'll talk\nabout in the troubleshooting episodes, so\n\n496\n00:23:48.164 --> 00:23:50.040\nbe sure to check those out.\n\n497\n00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:55.120\nFile permissions can oftentimes be\nthe problem that your users bump into,\n\n498\n00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.940\nbecause they're somewhat easy to mess up.\n\n499\n00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.830\nMost people don't\nunderstand them very well.\n\n500\n00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.890\nIf you stick with the GUI,\nit does a great job.\n\n501\n00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.830\nBut if you're making bulk changes,\nthe command line is really useful.\n\n502\n00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:09.290\nSo just keep both of those tools in your\ntool belt, and you'll be ready to get out\n\n503\n00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.620\nthere and take care of any permissions\nrelated issues that you bump into.\n\n504\n00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.250\nExcellent information as always,\nDon, and make sure you watch\n\n505\n00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.260\neverything in the Apple Certified\nSupport Professional series.\n\n506\n00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.580\nYou're gonna be very glad you did.\n\n507\n00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.530\nIt's gonna help you in those exams,\nit really will.\n\n508\n00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.100\nAnd you'll be in the course library.\n\n509\n00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.680\nThere's thousands of other videos there\nand they're designed for one thing,\n\n510\n00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.400\nto help you go further.\n\n511\n00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.880\nCheck those out, too.\n\n512\n00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.870\nHey, ITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n513\n00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.170\nMake sure you tell everybody about that.\n\n514\n00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.460\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n515\n00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.816\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again soon.\n\n516\n00:24:35.816 --> 00:24:40.935\n[MUSIC]\n\n517\n00:24:40.935 --> 00:24:45.754\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Well,\n\n15\n00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.260\nI am ready to support some Macs on my\nway to becoming an Apple certified\n\n16\n00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.810\nsupport professional.\n\n17\n00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.202\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna to be tackling managing files.\n\n18\n00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:43.330\nAnd don't worry.\nWe're not gonna bore you to death with\n\n19\n00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.400\ncopying and pasting files, and all that.\n\n20\n00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.177\nWe'll bore you another\nday with that stuff.\n\n21\n00:00:46.177 --> 00:00:46.803\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:00:46.803 --> 00:00:47.564\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna focus\n\n23\n00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:50.190\non some of the advanced features\nthat files have inside of macOS.\n\n24\n00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.490\nThere's actually a lot of little bells and\nwhistles, and some interesting features\n\n25\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.970\nthat are brought about,\nthanks to the macOS extended file system.\n\n26\n00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.022\nSo we're gonna give you a chance\nto see those right here.\n\n27\n00:00:59.022 --> 00:01:02.870\nI have to remember to mention APFS as\nwell, which provides these same features.\n\n28\n00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.730\nSo we're gonna get a chance to\nsee all those things right here\n\n29\n00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.670\nin this episode.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n30\n00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.270\nWell, Don, I know one of the first things\nthey like to call out when it comes to\n\n31\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.230\nthese advanced file system features is\naliasing, a very, very handy thing.\n\n32\n00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.490\nIf you're unfamiliar with aliasing inside\nof a file system, a very, very good thing.\n\n33\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.080\nAnd we have this ability inside\nof our Mac as well, correct?\n\n34\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.670\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n35\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.590\nexcept Mac aliases are a little more\npowerful than what a lot of other\n\n36\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.940\nplatforms have So other platforms like\nWindows, you have shortcuts, right?\n\n37\n00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.999\nA shortcut is just an icon that points\nto a file stored somewhere else, right?\n\n38\n00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:36.020\nSo you've got a file stored one place.\n\n39\n00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.580\nBut you don't wanna navigate,\nthere's too many folders deep or whatever.\n\n40\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.040\nYou have some program\nyou run all the time.\n\n41\n00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.900\nWell, you wanna move it somewhere else,\nright?\n\n42\n00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.670\nYou don't necessarily wanna move it\nthough, because that could cause problems.\n\n43\n00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.220\nLet's say, for example,\nthat I am constantly\n\n44\n00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.660\nhaving to go into,\nI have a little program called Media Info.\n\n45\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.760\nAnd Media Info,\n\n46\n00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.540\nif I browse into my applications,\nit should be sitting in here.\n\n47\n00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.230\nYou ever get a video file and\n\n48\n00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.876\nyou don't know what codec it is?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n49\n00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:10.789\n&gt;&gt; Or whatever.\n\n50\n00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.980\nThis little program, which seems-\n&gt;&gt; It's hiding from you.\n\n51\n00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.971\n&gt;&gt; It's so important that,\n\n52\n00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:16.920\nhave I not installed it?\n\n53\n00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.518\nAll right, we'll pick a different one.\n\n54\n00:02:18.518 --> 00:02:20.230\nWe'll do Serial.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n55\n00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.330\n&gt;&gt; For the record, Media Info,\n\n56\n00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.745\nyou can just drop a video file in and\nit tells you what codec it's using-\n\n57\n00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:24.374\n&gt;&gt; That's cool.\n\n58\n00:02:24.374 --> 00:02:25.690\n&gt;&gt; What bit rate and all that other stuff.\n\n59\n00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.920\nBut I'll take Serial here.\n\n60\n00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.340\nI work on routers and switches.\n\n61\n00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.380\nSometimes I need to plug into their\nconsole port using a serial cable.\n\n62\n00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.640\nThis program lets me do it.\n\n63\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.850\nSo let's say that I use this\nprogram all the time, right?\n\n64\n00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.930\nWell, I might say, man,\nI use this so much.\n\n65\n00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.120\nLet me just stick it on my desktop, right?\n\n66\n00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.630\nI'm gonna drag that and\ndrop it here on my desktop.\n\n67\n00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.500\nWell, if I do that, if I'm the\nadministrator I can, it'll let me move it.\n\n68\n00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.530\nIt'll prompt me for credentials.\n\n69\n00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.760\nThen I can move it out, right,\nand it'll be on my desktop.\n\n70\n00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.324\nAnd then I can run it,\nit'll let me run it from the desktop.\n\n71\n00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:59.130\nBut what about any other\nuser on my system?\n\n72\n00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.340\nThat application's now gone for\n\n73\n00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.050\nthem, because it's in the desktop\nfolder of my user profile, right?\n\n74\n00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.380\nThat's not good.\n\n75\n00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.030\nSo instead of moving it,\n\n76\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.339\nwhat we should do is create an alias or\na shortcut.\n\n77\n00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:16.950\nAnd you can do this with a file,\nyou can do it with a folder.\n\n78\n00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.740\nYou can do it with an application.\n\n79\n00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.110\nYou can really do it with anything\nthat's represented as an icon here.\n\n80\n00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.358\nAnd you can take that item and\nyou can make an alias for it.\n\n81\n00:03:26.358 --> 00:03:30.007\nIf you Ctrl+click on something,\nor I've got a magic touchpad, so\n\n82\n00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:31.230\nI two-finger click.\n\n83\n00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.090\nWhen you do that, you get your menu.\n\n84\n00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.620\nAnd in the menu,\nyou'll see an option here to Make Alias.\n\n85\n00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.960\nAnd I can make an alias\nof that Serial program.\n\n86\n00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.646\nAnd then I can take the alias, oops.\n&gt;&gt; And you can open it up [LAUGH].\n\n87\n00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:47.980\n&gt;&gt; Preview by accident, yeah.\n\n88\n00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.890\nAnd then I can just drag it and\ndrop it onto my desktop.\n\n89\n00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.290\nAnd there it is, right?\n\n90\n00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.244\nNow the important part here is that the\noriginal version of Serial, that program,\n\n91\n00:03:57.244 --> 00:03:59.099\nis still sitting right there.\n\n92\n00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.030\nSo all of the other users see it in\nthe Application folder like normal.\n\n93\n00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.060\nBut now I've got this nice,\n\n94\n00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.710\nneat little alias right here\nthat's pointing to it, okay?\n\n95\n00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.290\nAnd I know it's an alias cuz\nit's got this little arrow.\n\n96\n00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.750\nSee that little tiny arrow in the icon?\n\n97\n00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.080\nThat's the only way I really\nknow this is an alias.\n\n98\n00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.130\nBecause otherwise,\nif I double click on that,\n\n99\n00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.560\nit's gonna run just the same as\nif I ran the actual program.\n\n100\n00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.540\nSo if I, quit out of that.\n\n101\n00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.860\nIf I run the program from here or\n\n102\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.070\nif I run it from the desktop,\nit runs the same way, okay?\n\n103\n00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.350\nNow so far,\n\n104\n00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.570\nthat's not really much different\nthan a shortcut in other platforms.\n\n105\n00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.780\nSo what's so special about this?\n\n106\n00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.860\nWell, in the macOS extended file system,\nwhen you create an alias,\n\n107\n00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.860\nthe alias gets linked to the actual\ndata that is stored for this file.\n\n108\n00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.780\nAnd Apple tracks that file.\n\n109\n00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.690\nThey track all that information to make\nsure that they stay linked together.\n\n110\n00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.660\nSo I could take this program, and\n\n111\n00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.970\nI could move it to another folder,\nand the alias would still work.\n\n112\n00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.120\nI could take this program and I could\nrename it, and the alias would still work.\n\n113\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.520\nNow, we're not normally gonna do that\nwith a program like this, right?\n\n114\n00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.570\nSo let me get rid of these,\nso I'll just trash that.\n\n115\n00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.070\nAnd I trashed the alias there.\n\n116\n00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.650\nTechnically, this alias is a copy of\nthe other alias, but it will still work.\n\n117\n00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.550\nIf I run that,\nit will still run the program.\n\n118\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.660\nSo you know there, it pops back up.\n\n119\n00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.580\nBut normally, if we're gonna be moving\nthings around, it's gonna be a document or\n\n120\n00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.840\na folder, right?\n\n121\n00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.500\nSo let's take a document.\n\n122\n00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.434\nIf I go to my documents folder,\nI've got not much in here.\n\n123\n00:05:37.434 --> 00:05:40.263\nI've got a copy of Daniel's resume.\n&gt;&gt; He's got my resume, how about that?\n\n124\n00:05:40.263 --> 00:05:41.395\n&gt;&gt; So pretty handy to have.\n\n125\n00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:42.929\n&gt;&gt; Man, that's a small, small thing.\n\n126\n00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:43.675\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:44.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n128\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.777\nAnd I can take that resume, and\nI know it's in my Documents folder, right?\n\n129\n00:05:48.777 --> 00:05:51.070\nBut maybe I wanna create\nan alias somewhere.\n\n130\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.870\nAnd so I can come in here, and\nI can tell it to make an alias.\n\n131\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.250\nAnd I can drop that alias right\nhere on my desktop, right?\n\n132\n00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.080\nSo there it goes.\n\n133\n00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.750\nNow notice how it didn't make\na second one like it did before.\n\n134\n00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.370\nAnd that's because I was doing the other\none in the Applications folder, and\n\n135\n00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.930\nyou're not supposed to\nmess with that too much.\n\n136\n00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.380\nBut anyhow, it's created out here.\n\n137\n00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.210\nAnd it did stick the word\nalias on the end of it.\n\n138\n00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.130\nSo I can rename that, that's not a big\ndeal, I can kinda get rid of that.\n\n139\n00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.040\nOr maybe I change the whole\nname all together.\n\n140\n00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.334\nI can just call it Daniel's Resume.\n\n141\n00:06:21.334 --> 00:06:24.700\nI don't know how to type accents,\nso I can't type that the right way.\n\n142\n00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.540\nSo there it is.\n\n143\n00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.720\nAnd if I double click on that,\nit's gonna open up.\n\n144\n00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.420\nAnd there's his resume, right?\n\n145\n00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.237\nSo I can pull that out,\n\n146\n00:06:30.237 --> 00:06:31.740\nget all the information I need.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.340\n&gt;&gt; It's all right there.\n\n148\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.683\n&gt;&gt; Man, you know me all too well.\n\n149\n00:06:33.683 --> 00:06:34.188\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n150\n00:06:34.188 --> 00:06:36.131\n&gt;&gt; I like how you're able to keep your\n\n151\n00:06:36.131 --> 00:06:38.532\nresume down to one page.\n&gt;&gt; It's important, employers-\n\n152\n00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:40.030\n&gt;&gt; Well, I like to be succint.\n\n153\n00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.488\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they just need to get in,\n\n154\n00:06:41.488 --> 00:06:42.931\nlearn what you do.\n&gt;&gt; Give them a quick view, yeah.\n\n155\n00:06:42.931 --> 00:06:43.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I've got that.\n\n156\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.340\nNow, the fun part here is I can take his\noriginal resume, I can change that name.\n\n157\n00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.440\nMaybe when he sent it to me,\nit was just called resume, right?\n\n158\n00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.700\nSo I just renamed it.\n\n159\n00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.440\nWell, the alias, it still works.\n\n160\n00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.600\nThere it is, right?\n\n161\n00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.910\nAnd I can even move it\nto a different folder.\n\n162\n00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.910\nSo maybe I move it into,\nI don't know, something else.\n\n163\n00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.130\nWhat else I can move it into?\n\n164\n00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.400\nStick it in my Home folder maybe.\n\n165\n00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.650\nOops, I'm having a click and\ndrag crisis here.\n\n166\n00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.780\nYeah, here,\nI'll throw it in my Home folder.\n\n167\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.700\nSo now it's been moved to\nanother location, right?\n\n168\n00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.640\nI don't have to do anything to the alias.\n\n169\n00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.830\nIt just automatically knows,\nhey, that's been moved.\n\n170\n00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.910\nAnd there it goes,\nit takes me back to the alias.\n\n171\n00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.670\nSo pretty neat thing there.\n\n172\n00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.050\nIf I go and delete the resume, right, so\n\n173\n00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.960\nmaybe I move it to the Trash,\nso it goes away.\n\n174\n00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.257\nWhat happens to the alias?\n&gt;&gt; It's still there.\n\n175\n00:07:33.257 --> 00:07:33.981\n&gt;&gt; Well now,\n\n176\n00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:39.250\nthe original, it's technically\nstill there, but it's in the Trash.\n\n177\n00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.850\nAnd so it tells me that.\n\n178\n00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.170\nIt says, document resume can't be opened,\nnot because it can't be found, but\n\n179\n00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.710\nbecause it's in the Trash.\n&gt;&gt; So by putting it in the Trash,\n\n180\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.570\nit sees it as, even though the file's not\ntechnically gone gone, it's in the Trash.\n\n181\n00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.351\nBut it's saying,\nbecause it's in the Trash,\n\n182\n00:07:53.351 --> 00:07:54.830\nbasically you don't want to see this.\n\n183\n00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.813\nSo if you want it back,\nyou would need to get it out of there.\n\n184\n00:07:56.813 --> 00:07:57.582\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, so\n\n185\n00:07:57.582 --> 00:07:59.495\nI would need go to the Trash and\nrestore that item.\n\n186\n00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:00.618\nAnd then this would work again.\n\n187\n00:08:00.618 --> 00:08:02.932\nOr if I've emptied my trash, right?\n\n188\n00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:06.645\nSo if I go down here and\nlet me empty my trash.\n\n189\n00:08:06.645 --> 00:08:10.861\nI'm gonna lose your resume, which it\nwas the only copy I had of your resume,\n\n190\n00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:11.365\ndarn it.\n\n191\n00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:15.681\nAnyhow, so now that it's gone, now,\nwhen I run that alias, I get the message,\n\n192\n00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:18.047\nthe original item can't be found, right?\n\n193\n00:08:18.047 --> 00:08:20.886\nSo it'll track it all over\nthe hard drive until it's gone.\n\n194\n00:08:20.886 --> 00:08:22.815\n[LAUGH] And\nthen you've got a bit of a problem.\n\n195\n00:08:22.815 --> 00:08:25.988\nSo alias is really cool\nbecause they can do that.\n\n196\n00:08:25.988 --> 00:08:30.867\nAnd if you use these a lot, you'll start\nto learn some of the shortcuts for them.\n\n197\n00:08:30.867 --> 00:08:35.184\nLike I don't normally do the, pull up\nthe menu and hit make alias, Cmd+L.\n\n198\n00:08:35.184 --> 00:08:38.744\nCmd+L makes an alias, and\nI remember l as link instead of alias,\n\n199\n00:08:38.744 --> 00:08:42.714\nthat's just how I remember it, but\nthat will let you create that alias.\n\n200\n00:08:42.714 --> 00:08:46.346\nAnd here, this resume's gone, but\nit's still not throwing the alias away,\n\n201\n00:08:46.346 --> 00:08:49.701\nit's giving me a chance to say,\nlet's fix the alias, let's browse and\n\n202\n00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:51.369\nfind another file to point this at.\n\n203\n00:08:51.369 --> 00:08:54.935\nAnd we can point it, and then it'll be\nhappy again or I can just delete it.\n\n204\n00:08:54.935 --> 00:08:57.938\nAnd this alias is bad,\nlet's get rid of it, and it's gone.\n\n205\n00:08:57.938 --> 00:09:02.330\nSo, aliases are a lot more powerful than\njust a simple shortcut pointing to a file,\n\n206\n00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.206\nthey actually track the original file.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don,\n\n207\n00:09:05.206 --> 00:09:09.264\nis there any other ways in which we\ncan do aliasing, shortcuting inside?\n\n208\n00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:13.386\nAgain, I know Apple, they love to give\nyou multiple different ways to do stuff.\n\n209\n00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.247\n&gt;&gt; So as far as Apple is concerned and\n\n210\n00:09:15.247 --> 00:09:19.512\nas far as the end users are concerned,\nthat's the way they want you to do it.\n\n211\n00:09:19.512 --> 00:09:23.358\nAliases are powerful, they work really\nwell, that's what they want you to use,\n\n212\n00:09:23.358 --> 00:09:23.925\nall right?\n\n213\n00:09:23.925 --> 00:09:27.802\nBut under the hood,\nMac OS is running BSD Unix.\n\n214\n00:09:27.802 --> 00:09:30.621\nAnd in the Unix world they have\nhad what are called links,\n\n215\n00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:32.924\nremember I said Cmd+L,\nI remember his link.\n\n216\n00:09:32.924 --> 00:09:36.928\nThe Unix world has had links since\nthe 1970s, they've been around a long,\n\n217\n00:09:36.928 --> 00:09:37.538\nlong time.\n\n218\n00:09:37.538 --> 00:09:41.274\nAnd we still have linking\nsupport in Mac OS.\n\n219\n00:09:41.274 --> 00:09:45.790\nThe thing is,\nit doesn't quite work in the GUI, right?\n\n220\n00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.916\nIn the Graphical User Interface I\ncan't create a Unix style link.\n\n221\n00:09:48.916 --> 00:09:51.029\nI'm supposed to create an alias, right?\n\n222\n00:09:51.029 --> 00:09:52.828\nAnd I can do that and they work fine.\n\n223\n00:09:52.828 --> 00:09:56.226\nIf I go into the Unix side of things,\nthough, I can create Unix links.\n\n224\n00:09:56.226 --> 00:09:59.750\nAnd they'll show up in the GUI,\nI can use them in the GUI.\n\n225\n00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.574\nI just can't create them in the GUI,\nright?\n\n226\n00:10:02.574 --> 00:10:06.242\nSo let me give you an example\nof something like that.\n\n227\n00:10:06.242 --> 00:10:09.793\nLet's say that my Documents folder, right?\n\n228\n00:10:09.793 --> 00:10:12.513\nI'm browsing my Documents folder a lot,\nand so\n\n229\n00:10:12.513 --> 00:10:16.661\nI want to be able to get at it a little\nmore easily, or Daniel's resume for\n\n230\n00:10:16.661 --> 00:10:17.335\nexample.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n231\n00:10:17.335 --> 00:10:19.320\n&gt;&gt; Let's-\n\n232\n00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.123\n&gt;&gt; I conveniently left off my\n\n233\n00:10:20.123 --> 00:10:20.711\nprison sentence.\n\n234\n00:10:20.711 --> 00:10:22.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Daniel's resume that I deleted.\n\n235\n00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.214\nSo let's recreate that.\n\n236\n00:10:26.214 --> 00:10:32.260\nJust as a simple file here,\nI'll do a new document called Resume.\n\n237\n00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.045\nAnd we'll call that file resume,\nthere we go.\n\n238\n00:10:36.045 --> 00:10:39.648\nSo, I've just kinda created it,\nand there's his resume, right?\n\n239\n00:10:39.648 --> 00:10:42.674\nNow, I can get into my terminal.\n\n240\n00:10:42.674 --> 00:10:48.230\nAnd in the terminal- We can create links,\nright?\n\n241\n00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:53.076\nNow, that file right now is in\nmy documents folder, right?\n\n242\n00:10:53.076 --> 00:10:55.690\nSo there I can see a resume.rtf.\n\n243\n00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:59.181\nI might wanna create a link\nto put that onto my desktop.\n\n244\n00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:04.244\nSo I can use the Ln command,\nthat's the Linux command for\n\n245\n00:11:04.244 --> 00:11:09.956\ncreating links, and if I say Ln\n-s then I can tell it the target.\n\n246\n00:11:09.956 --> 00:11:13.798\nThe target in this case is that.\n\n247\n00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:18.280\nLet's see, /Documents/resume.rtf, right?\n\n248\n00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.408\nThat's the target or the source.\n\n249\n00:11:21.408 --> 00:11:24.149\nAnd then where I want the link to be.\n\n250\n00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:26.718\nAnd I want the link to be on my desktop.\n\n251\n00:11:26.718 --> 00:11:30.699\nAnd I want it to be\ncalled daniel-resume.rtf,\n\n252\n00:11:30.699 --> 00:11:36.923\ncuz the link name doesn't have to match,\nyou can call it whatever you want.\n\n253\n00:11:36.923 --> 00:11:38.462\nSo I can create that link.\n\n254\n00:11:38.462 --> 00:11:43.880\nAnd the moment I did that,\nthis file appeared on my desktop, right?\n\n255\n00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.318\nAnd if I zoom in on it I can\neven see the little arrow on it,\n\n256\n00:11:48.318 --> 00:11:50.685\njust like a Mac alias, okay?\n\n257\n00:11:50.685 --> 00:11:54.736\nSo it's created it, here it is,\nit created that link, right?\n\n258\n00:11:54.736 --> 00:11:58.330\nSo effectively,\nit's the same as an alias, right?\n\n259\n00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.029\nWell, there are some limitations.\n\n260\n00:12:00.029 --> 00:12:04.347\nIf I double click on that, it's gonna open\nup, there it is, there's his new resume.\n\n261\n00:12:04.347 --> 00:12:07.106\nNot nearly this cool, it's his old resume.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n262\n00:12:07.106 --> 00:12:08.459\n&gt;&gt; But there it is, but,\n\n263\n00:12:08.459 --> 00:12:13.234\nif I start messing around with the source\nfile, or you know, moving it around,\n\n264\n00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:17.615\ndoing things like that, this is\ntracked a little differently, right?\n\n265\n00:12:17.615 --> 00:12:21.893\nWith the Unix links,\nthey're not as flexible, and so\n\n266\n00:12:21.893 --> 00:12:27.574\nnow I'm double clicking on that file and\nnothing is happening, right?\n\n267\n00:12:27.574 --> 00:12:32.637\nIt's not tracked like a Mac alias is,\nand if I look at the actual listing.\n\n268\n00:12:32.637 --> 00:12:35.982\nLet me get into my desktop here,\nand I do an ls -l,\n\n269\n00:12:35.982 --> 00:12:40.864\nI can see where daniel.resume.rtf\nis linked, see that little arrow.\n\n270\n00:12:40.864 --> 00:12:44.049\nAnd it's still linked to the old name,\nright?\n\n271\n00:12:44.049 --> 00:12:45.441\nThese don't dynamically update.\n\n272\n00:12:45.441 --> 00:12:50.275\nSo they are there, the support is there\nand you do Unix links for folders and\n\n273\n00:12:50.275 --> 00:12:52.983\nfiles, but aliases are better, right?\n\n274\n00:12:52.983 --> 00:12:56.522\nThese types of links are here just if you\nneed them for like scripting support.\n\n275\n00:12:56.522 --> 00:12:59.507\nIf you got bash script that you\nrun that performs some operation,\n\n276\n00:12:59.507 --> 00:13:00.652\nyou can use these links.\n\n277\n00:13:00.652 --> 00:13:05.661\nBut by and large you're gonna use the MAC\naliases, that's really the way to go.\n\n278\n00:13:05.661 --> 00:13:06.915\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don,\n\n279\n00:13:06.915 --> 00:13:10.356\nI noticed that you put a little\n-s there next one, you did Ln.\n\n280\n00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:12.769\nLn is the command that creates the link.\n\n281\n00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:16.287\nWhen you add the -s,\nwhat was the purpose of the -s?\n\n282\n00:13:16.287 --> 00:13:18.393\n&gt;&gt; Well, what I was doing there,\n\n283\n00:13:18.393 --> 00:13:22.690\nyou have symbolic links, and\nthen you have hard links, okay?\n\n284\n00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.532\nThe one I did symbolic link, and symbolic\nlinks work for files and directory.\n\n285\n00:13:26.532 --> 00:13:28.332\nSo that's what I normally use.\n\n286\n00:13:28.332 --> 00:13:30.317\nBut they're not flexible at all,\n\n287\n00:13:30.317 --> 00:13:31.693\nyou saw right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n288\n00:13:31.693 --> 00:13:32.514\n&gt;&gt; I rename the file and\n\n289\n00:13:32.514 --> 00:13:33.675\nthings broke down, right?\n\n290\n00:13:33.675 --> 00:13:38.357\nWell, a hard link on the other hand\nactually survives stuff like that,\n\n291\n00:13:38.357 --> 00:13:40.868\nit can survive the file being rename.\n\n292\n00:13:40.868 --> 00:13:43.107\nIt can even survive\nthe file being deleted.\n\n293\n00:13:43.107 --> 00:13:46.279\nBecause when you create a hard link it\nkeeps the file around as long as that\n\n294\n00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:47.113\nhard link exists.\n\n295\n00:13:47.113 --> 00:13:51.897\nSo hard links may sound better off hand\nbut the problem with hard links is they\n\n296\n00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:55.647\ndon't work with directories,\nthey only work with files.\n\n297\n00:13:55.647 --> 00:13:58.366\nWith directories you have\nto do a symbolic link.\n\n298\n00:13:58.366 --> 00:14:00.663\nAnd so\nif I'm trying to create an alias for\n\n299\n00:14:00.663 --> 00:14:02.837\na directory I wanna do a symbolic link.\n\n300\n00:14:02.837 --> 00:14:07.175\nAnd the reality is I'm a forgetful person,\nand so I forget sometimes, and so\n\n301\n00:14:07.175 --> 00:14:10.336\nI just know hey,\nif I do a symbolic link it always works.\n\n302\n00:14:10.336 --> 00:14:13.699\nAnd if I have an actual need for\na hard link, then I'll go in and\n\n303\n00:14:13.699 --> 00:14:14.883\nactually create it.\n\n304\n00:14:14.883 --> 00:14:16.612\nBut the syntax is really\nnot that different.\n\n305\n00:14:16.612 --> 00:14:21.901\nLet me get rid of the link that\nwe created just a moment ago.\n\n306\n00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:24.807\nSo I'm gonna get rid of that, you guys\nsaw the icon disappeared over here.\n\n307\n00:14:24.807 --> 00:14:28.240\nAnd I'm gonna repeat that\nprocess of creating a link.\n\n308\n00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.462\nActually I have to change it a little\nbit because I renamed this file.\n\n309\n00:14:31.462 --> 00:14:33.458\nIt's now resume-2.rtf, right?\n\n310\n00:14:33.458 --> 00:14:35.513\nSo I'm gonna relink that, okay?\n\n311\n00:14:35.513 --> 00:14:38.009\nBut this time I'm gonna\nget rid of that -s.\n\n312\n00:14:38.009 --> 00:14:41.799\nAnd when I knock that -s off,\noops, I should have,\n\n313\n00:14:41.799 --> 00:14:44.790\nyou can hit Ctrl+A to jump to that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n314\n00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.925\n&gt;&gt; It's really way faster than\n\n315\n00:14:45.925 --> 00:14:46.590\nwhat I just did.\n\n316\n00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.966\n[LAUGH] But so\nnow I'm gonna create that link, and\n\n317\n00:14:50.966 --> 00:14:56.099\nI'm not specifying -s, so\nthis is gonna do a hard link.\n\n318\n00:14:56.099 --> 00:15:00.138\nAnd when I run that,\nthe link appears over here, right?\n\n319\n00:15:00.138 --> 00:15:01.049\nBut look at that icon.\n\n320\n00:15:02.895 --> 00:15:06.023\nThat's not like the symbolic link.\n&gt;&gt; No little arrow saying hey,\n\n321\n00:15:06.023 --> 00:15:09.522\nthis is like a shortcut.\n&gt;&gt; So, at this point,\n\n322\n00:15:09.522 --> 00:15:12.937\nMac OS doesn't know that it's a link.\n\n323\n00:15:12.937 --> 00:15:15.153\nIt thinks that's the real file, right?\n\n324\n00:15:15.153 --> 00:15:19.298\nThis is a file table entry pointing\nto data on the hard drive.\n\n325\n00:15:19.298 --> 00:15:22.946\nThere just happens to be a second file\ntable entry that's in another folder that\n\n326\n00:15:22.946 --> 00:15:24.096\npoints to the same data.\n\n327\n00:15:24.096 --> 00:15:27.068\nIt doesn't treat it like a link,it\ntreats it like a real file,\n\n328\n00:15:27.068 --> 00:15:28.930\nthat's why this can survive a delete.\n\n329\n00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.956\nThat I can actually delete\nthe source file and\n\n330\n00:15:30.956 --> 00:15:32.884\nstill be able to get to\nit through this one.\n\n331\n00:15:32.884 --> 00:15:35.826\nBut I also don't know if\nit's a link anymore, right?\n\n332\n00:15:35.826 --> 00:15:39.891\nAnd if I double click on that it's\ngonna open up,there is your resume.\n\n333\n00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:44.873\nAnd if I go back to that folder,\nand I'm gonna rename it because it\n\n334\n00:15:44.873 --> 00:15:49.054\nwas just called resume and\nthen I renamed it resume2.\n\n335\n00:15:49.054 --> 00:15:53.108\nSo if I rename that back to just\ndaniel-resume like that, well,\n\n336\n00:15:53.108 --> 00:15:56.290\nactually let me clarify\nwhat just happened there.\n\n337\n00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.221\nIt was called resume-2.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n338\n00:15:58.221 --> 00:15:59.194\n&gt;&gt; And I clicked on it, and\n\n339\n00:15:59.194 --> 00:16:01.887\nI didn't type that,\nit immediately popped up daniel-resume.\n\n340\n00:16:01.887 --> 00:16:02.962\nDo you know where that came from?\n\n341\n00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.999\nI have no idea.\n&gt;&gt; It came from.\n\n342\n00:16:04.999 --> 00:16:06.336\n&gt;&gt; From the-\n\n343\n00:16:06.336 --> 00:16:07.298\n&gt;&gt; The hard link.\n\n344\n00:16:07.298 --> 00:16:09.507\n&gt;&gt; Because it's seeing that as the same\n\n345\n00:16:09.507 --> 00:16:11.280\nthing.\n&gt;&gt; It sees it as the same thing and\n\n346\n00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.190\nthat one was created second.\n\n347\n00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.210\nSo when I went to rename it, the GUI said,\nwhat's the most recent filename for\n\n348\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.200\nthis file?\n\n349\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.290\nAnd it found the link.\n\n350\n00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.630\nThe GUI doesn't know.\n\n351\n00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.720\nIt thinks that's the same file, right?\n\n352\n00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.470\nLike at this point, we've taken control\ncompletely out of Apple's hands.\n\n353\n00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.730\nAnd put it in the Unix system, right?\n\n354\n00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.230\nSo again, not something we would\nwant our regular users to do.\n\n355\n00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.620\nWell, I mean, they certainly could.\n\n356\n00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:38.532\nBut now if I come in, I rename it,\nlet's rename it daniel or resume-3,\n\n357\n00:16:38.532 --> 00:16:40.050\nright, resume-3.\n\n358\n00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.580\nSo now it has been renamed once more,\nright.\n\n359\n00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.400\nWell, if I look at my desktop 1,\n\n360\n00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.040\nlook at that name.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n361\n00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.260\n&gt;&gt; It thinks at the same file, right?\n\n362\n00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.660\nThat's really what's happening,\nthe GUI doesn't know.\n\n363\n00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.160\nAnd if I come in here and\nI delete this one,\n\n364\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.330\nI'll just move that to the trash, right?\n\n365\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.877\nI get one or\nmore items can't be found [LAUGH], so\n\n366\n00:16:57.877 --> 00:17:00.819\nit's really starting to freak\nout a little bit there.\n\n367\n00:17:00.819 --> 00:17:01.697\nWhat?\n&gt;&gt; Looks\n\n368\n00:17:01.697 --> 00:17:02.277\nlike it made a copy.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n369\n00:17:02.277 --> 00:17:02.995\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n370\n00:17:02.995 --> 00:17:04.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it made a copy on me.\n\n371\n00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:07.084\nAll right, so it's probably because I,\ndid I remove the?\n\n372\n00:17:07.084 --> 00:17:10.648\nBut I might not have removed the symbolic\nlinks, I might have two links.\n\n373\n00:17:10.648 --> 00:17:11.177\n&gt;&gt; That's fun.\n\n374\n00:17:11.177 --> 00:17:12.327\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:17:12.327 --> 00:17:13.287\n&gt;&gt; Let me see, yeah,\n\n376\n00:17:13.287 --> 00:17:14.476\nit won't let me go.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n377\n00:17:14.476 --> 00:17:15.421\nlinks fighting each [CROSSTALK] others.\n\n378\n00:17:15.421 --> 00:17:16.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is a problem you can run into when\n\n379\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.820\nyou're dealing with\na file system like this.\n\n380\n00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.510\nLet me just take a look\nat what all I have.\n\n381\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:26.020\nSo here, I'm on my desktop, and\nI'm pulling up the extended view.\n\n382\n00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.810\nNow, you guys saw me create this link,\nright?\n\n383\n00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:32.740\nAnd when I created it,\nI used the LN command, and I made it.\n\n384\n00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:37.164\nBut over here, when Is-l,\neven in the Unix world,\n\n385\n00:17:37.164 --> 00:17:43.420\nI'm not seeing that as a link,\nI'm seeing that as the as the actual file.\n\n386\n00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.520\nAnd if I come in here into my documents,\nI can see that resume too.\n\n387\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.620\nThe GUI has gotten out of sync\nwith the command line at this\n\n388\n00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.153\npoint.\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n389\n00:17:51.153 --> 00:17:52.190\n&gt;&gt; And that happens.\n\n390\n00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:56.130\nFinder doesn't necessarily see changes\nthat you make from the terminal just yet.\n\n391\n00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.561\nSo looking at it from here,\nI see resume-2, I don't see resume-3.\n\n392\n00:17:59.561 --> 00:18:01.605\nIn the GUI, I still have resume-3.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n393\n00:18:01.605 --> 00:18:02.707\n&gt;&gt; Now Apple assumes your\n\n394\n00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:06.490\nnever gonna do this stuff, so\nthere's no like, right-click and refresh.\n\n395\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.875\nYou don't have that option in here.\n\n396\n00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:11.090\nBut eventually, the finder will\ncatch up and clean it up for that.\n\n397\n00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:15.210\nSo that's another reason why we don't\nreally want to use these links,\n\n398\n00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.280\nif we don't have to.\n\n399\n00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.830\nBut the support is there,\nyou can jump in and tackle them,\n\n400\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.280\nit's built in.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\n\n401\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.930\nobviously, you've got to be careful and\nmake sure everything's working as you\n\n402\n00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.890\nplanned before you move\non to the next thing.\n\n403\n00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:31.360\nAnd speaking of the next thing, Don, is\nthere any other special type of files that\n\n404\n00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.420\nwe might encounter on Mac OS?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n405\n00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.770\nThere's actually a lot of weird ones.\n\n406\n00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.700\nKind of a whole list of\n\n407\n00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.320\nones to go through.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n408\n00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.280\n&gt;&gt; But there's one that I-\n\n409\n00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.376\n&gt;&gt; How much time do you got, right?\n\n410\n00:18:40.376 --> 00:18:41.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's one big one that\n\n411\n00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.300\nI want to highlight,\nthat a lot of people don't realize.\n\n412\n00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.190\nAnd that is programs,\nprograms on a Mac, right.\n\n413\n00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:52.180\nIf you've ever worked with Linux or\nif you've ever worked with Windows,\n\n414\n00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.040\ninstalling a program is kind of a pain,\nright.\n\n415\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.870\nYou've got to run some setup file, and\n\n416\n00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:01.110\nthen it asked you a directory to install\nand then it copies over a thousand files.\n\n417\n00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.824\nAnd then it runs, and\n\n418\n00:19:01.824 --> 00:19:03.908\nit creates a configuration like\nall this stuff has to happen.\n\n419\n00:19:03.908 --> 00:19:08.514\nAnd if you want to get rid of the program,\nyou have to run some special uninstaller\n\n420\n00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:13.420\nthat knows all the different places these\nfiles are, and gets them and removes them.\n\n421\n00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.350\nOn a Mac,\nit's not like that though, is it?\n\n422\n00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.660\nIf I get a new program, right.\n\n423\n00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.100\nI'm sure I have got something that\nI've downloaded here, let's see.\n\n424\n00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.590\nSo I go into my downloads, I download\nmore things than I probably should.\n\n425\n00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.854\nBut if I come in here and\ntake a look at here, Haroopad,\n\n426\n00:19:25.854 --> 00:19:27.040\nthat's a little-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n427\n00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.100\n&gt;&gt; Text editor that I use.\n\n428\n00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:34.480\nI download it as a dmg, and\nwhen I open that dmg, how do I install it?\n\n429\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.630\nI drag the icon.\n\n430\n00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:39.120\nI drop it in applications, and I'm done.\n&gt;&gt; I've got to be honest when I first\n\n431\n00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.840\nworked on Mac, I was like, what do I do?\n\n432\n00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.761\nWhat's happening here?\n\n433\n00:19:42.761 --> 00:19:45.442\nWhere's the installation?\n\n434\n00:19:45.442 --> 00:19:47.042\nSlide done [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n435\n00:19:47.042 --> 00:19:51.040\nAnd then if I decide, I hate Haroopad,\nI wanna get rid of it, right?\n\n436\n00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.890\nI don't have to run some crazy\nuninstaller, I just go to\n\n437\n00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:58.460\nthe applications folder, I find Haroopad,\nhere it is, I can just drag that and\n\n438\n00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.690\ndrop it in the trash and Haroopad is gone.\n&gt;&gt; So this is self-contained packages,\n\n439\n00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.900\nthey work within themselves,\nthey don't look into a lot of things, or\n\n440\n00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.470\nat least most of them, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, so what's happening here is\n\n441\n00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:10.340\nthe operating system is lying to us.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n442\n00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:10.865\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n443\n00:20:10.865 --> 00:20:13.000\n[LAUGH] And it's tricking us into thinking\n\n444\n00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.080\nit's a single file.\n&gt;&gt;

Very traditional looking file\n\n501\n00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.790\nstructure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n502\n00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.650\nAnd now treating it like a folder,\nand if you watch my\n\n503\n00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:19.000\nbread crumb trail down here at the bottom,\nI'm in the applications folder and\n\n504\n00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.270\nnow I'm in the Disc Inventory X folder,\nand I see contents.\n\n505\n00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:27.180\nAnd inside of contents, I then see,\nFrameworks, MacOS, Resources,\n\n506\n00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.320\nResources Disabled.\n\n507\n00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.240\nThese are all the elements\nthat make up this program.\n\n508\n00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.800\nAnd there's this Info.plist and Pkginfo.\n\n509\n00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.010\nThat's what tells the operating system,\nhey, this is a program.\n\n510\n00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:42.640\nHere's the things I need to run,\nand here is the actual executable,\n\n511\n00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.910\nthe actual program that\nyou're going to run.\n\n512\n00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:47.945\nAnd if you browse in here,\ninto like resources,\n\n513\n00:22:47.945 --> 00:22:53.370\nyou'll find all the icons and images that\nare displayed as a part of that program.\n\n514\n00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:59.285\nAnd if you go into the MacOS folder,\nthat's where you'll find the real program.\n\n515\n00:22:59.285 --> 00:23:01.850\nThat's the actual binary that we run.\n\n516\n00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:03.780\nDoesn't have a pretty icon, right?\n\n517\n00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.552\nIt just has the exact.\n\n518\n00:23:05.552 --> 00:23:07.815\nRight. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Because\nit's a binary file, right?\n\n519\n00:23:07.815 --> 00:23:14.050\nBut that's the real program, and they've\nmade it easy for us by hiding all that.\n\n520\n00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:17.040\nThe program, or whoever wrote this\nprogram, they had to figure out.\n\n521\n00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.850\nWell, now I've gotta put these\nin the right folders, and\n\n522\n00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.090\nthen I stick .app on the end and\nI'm done, right?\n\n523\n00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.730\nAs an end user, drag it,\ndrop on applications, right.\n\n524\n00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.170\nSo it's not a alias, it's not a link,\n\n525\n00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:32.130\nit's not an archive even,\nthis isn't even compressed.\n\n526\n00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.930\nThis is just a folder, and\nwhen you stick .app on the end of it,\n\n527\n00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.200\nit stops being a folder and\nstarts being a program.\n\n528\n00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:43.360\nAnd that's when it expects to have\nparticular folders and files inside of it.\n\n529\n00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.050\nSo when I come in here and I take a look\nat the contents, and then the frameworks\n\n530\n00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.520\nor whatever it's expecting those things\nto be in a very particular place.\n\n531\n00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.290\nWe don't want to get in here and\n\n532\n00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:51.959\njust start messing around.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n533\n00:23:51.959 --> 00:23:53.807\n&gt;&gt; In fact, if you've downloaded an app\n\n534\n00:23:53.807 --> 00:23:57.849\nfrom the App store, if you change anything\ninside of it, the app won't run anymore\n\n535\n00:23:57.849 --> 00:24:01.808\nbecause it has a digital signature, and\nthat signature is now invalid, right.\n\n536\n00:24:01.808 --> 00:24:04.293\nBut that's why programs are so\neasy to work with.\n\n537\n00:24:04.293 --> 00:24:07.234\nAnd these are called application bundles.\n\n538\n00:24:07.234 --> 00:24:10.390\nThat's Apple's official name for\nthese, they're called bundles.\n\n539\n00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:15.340\nThat all the files for that program\nare bundled into one folder and\n\n540\n00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.730\nthat's the whole program, almost.\n\n541\n00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:24.150\nThere's one more thing that doesn't get\nstored inside of the application folder,\n\n542\n00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.060\nand that's your preferences, right?\n\n543\n00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:30.010\nYour preferences, if you launch a program,\nhere's Disk Inventory X, right?\n\n544\n00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.100\nIf you've never heard of this program,\nI love it.\n\n545\n00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.810\nIf you are running low in disk space,\nyou fire this thing up,\n\n546\n00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.790\nit scans across your disk and it tells you\nwhere you're using all your disk space,\n\n547\n00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.240\nand for me it's always virtual machines.\n\n548\n00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.307\nI can just go right to my VMWare Fusion\ndirectory and that's where my space is,\n\n549\n00:24:42.307 --> 00:24:45.045\nbut there's other times where you might\nnot know and so you can go in and\n\n550\n00:24:45.045 --> 00:24:46.480\nfind things, great.\n\n551\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:52.190\nWell, if I go into Disk Inventory X,\nI can go into the menu and preferences and\n\n552\n00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.470\nI can pull up the preferences of\nthat application or I can try to.\n\n553\n00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:57.710\nThat may be a bad example,\nthey might not have preferences.\n\n554\n00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.403\nIt crashed.\nWell, there you go.\n\n555\n00:25:01.403 --> 00:25:03.150\n[CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me ignore that.\n\n556\n00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.400\nLet's pick a different program,\nwe'll go into Serial.\n\n557\n00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.130\nSo, if I launch Serial and\nI go into my Serial menu and\n\n558\n00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.450\nI go into Preferences,\nthen I get preferences.\n\n559\n00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.240\nI can tweak these things, right?\n\n560\n00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.110\nIt doesn't change these\nin the application,\n\n561\n00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.100\nbecause then they would\napply to all users.\n\n562\n00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.110\nEach user should be able to\nhave their own preferences.\n\n563\n00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:21.860\nSo, it's gonna create a preference file\nthat's stored in my home directory\n\n564\n00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.950\nin my profile, so that when I\nrun the program, it'll be there.\n\n565\n00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:25.970\nAnd that's kinda cool,\n\n566\n00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.460\ncuz I can delete the program and\nthen I can put the program back and\n\n567\n00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.707\nall my preferences are still there.\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n568\n00:25:30.707 --> 00:25:31.790\n&gt;&gt; It's set up the way I want,\n\n569\n00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:35.200\nunless that's not what I want, like if I\nscrewed up a preference that doesn't help.\n\n570\n00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.366\n&gt;&gt; I would assume you could also copy\n\n571\n00:25:36.366 --> 00:25:39.076\nthat preference file and take it to\nanother machine, install the program and\n\n572\n00:25:39.076 --> 00:25:40.834\nhave all your preferences.\n&gt;&gt; You could, yeah.\n\n573\n00:25:40.834 --> 00:25:44.948\nIn fact, if you really wanna get\nadvanced you can use iCloud and sync it,\n\n574\n00:25:44.948 --> 00:25:48.260\nthat way it stays in sync between\nthe two of your machines.\n\n575\n00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.785\nYou can really do some fun stuff with it,\nbut that's basically the way that you're\n\n576\n00:25:51.785 --> 00:25:55.340\ngonna see that, those applications,\nthat bundle file.\n\n577\n00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.300\nIt's a special type of file and\nit's just a Mac OS thing.\n\n578\n00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:02.160\nThey don't do that in Windows or Linux,\nthey all their own far more convoluted way\n\n579\n00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.280\nof dealing with it.\n&gt;&gt; Well Don,\n\n580\n00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.260\nI know we're running short on time,\nbut I wanted to ask you this as well.\n\n581\n00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.440\nIs that dot app, that's what\ntells me this is an application,\n\n582\n00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.480\nthis is something I'm gonna run on\nprograms, install on the machine,\n\n583\n00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:18.350\nis that the only type of applications\nthat we're gonna see in Mac OS?\n\n584\n00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.070\n&gt;&gt; It usually is, but\n\n585\n00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:23.120\nthere are exceptions, for\nexample, you might have noticed\n\n586\n00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.300\nI'm not using an official Apple keyboard.\n&gt;&gt; How dare you, sir.\n\n587\n00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.890\n&gt;&gt; Don't tell Apple.\n\n588\n00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:33.035\nSo anyhow, I'm using a Logitech keyboard,\nmostly because I had it.\n\n589\n00:26:33.035 --> 00:26:34.615\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n590\n00:26:34.615 --> 00:26:35.311\n&gt;&gt; And when you buy a Mac,\n\n591\n00:26:35.311 --> 00:26:37.484\nmaybe it doesn't come with a keyboard,\nso you have to get one anyway.\n\n592\n00:26:37.484 --> 00:26:38.915\nI had this one.\n\n593\n00:26:38.915 --> 00:26:43.441\nSo, that's why I'm using it, and\nI had to plug in a Logitech receiver and\n\n594\n00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:45.640\nthere's a Logitech driver for it.\n\n595\n00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.920\nNow, drivers don't install\nin the /applications folder,\n\n596\n00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.320\ndrivers are different, right?\n\n597\n00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.330\nDrivers actually modify\npart of your system,\n\n598\n00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:56.670\nthey get loaded into special folders\nwhere that stuff is available, and\n\n599\n00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.780\nas a result they can't run\nlike a normal program.\n\n600\n00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.750\nSo they're not sent out as a bundle file,\nthey're not sent out as something that\n\n601\n00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:07.450\nends in .app like what we've seen so far,\ninstead they're sent out as pkgs, right?\n\n602\n00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.150\nOr package files.\n\n603\n00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.900\nAnd package files?\n\n604\n00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.320\nRemember all the stuff I\nsaid about Windows and\n\n605\n00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.740\nwhen you have to run a setup and you have\nto click through menus and all that?\n\n606\n00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.390\nThat's how package files work.\n\n607\n00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:22.060\nBut it's necessary for a driver,\nbecause it's gonna have to get elevated\n\n608\n00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.660\nprivileges, it's gonna have write to these\ndifferent directories in different places\n\n609\n00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.770\nand to remove the driver, it's gotta be\nable to reach out to the different places.\n\n610\n00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:31.860\nThat's the more traditional model you\nsee from other operating systems.\n\n611\n00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:36.640\nBut if I go back to my Downloads folder,\nI should be able to find, here.\n\n612\n00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.000\nHere's the Logitech\nControl Center Installer,\n\n613\n00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.120\nthat I needed to install to be able to see\nmy keyboard, and the Unifying Installer to\n\n614\n00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.090\npower the little dongle that's\nthe wireless receiver for all this stuff.\n\n615\n00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:50.460\nSo, those are programs, but they're\nactually packages and they have the little\n\n616\n00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:55.970\npackage icon, which is different than\nwhat you would normally see on a program.\n\n617\n00:27:55.970 --> 00:28:03.080\nAnd if I look at that from the terminal,\nand I kind of peek at it in here.\n\n618\n00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.900\nThere's that Unifying Installer,\nsee how Unifying Installer ends in .app?\n\n619\n00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.320\nThey actually made it a .app.\n\n620\n00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:15.140\nAnd then the Logitech control\ncenter is showing as .app,\n\n621\n00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.970\nbut those are actually packages,\nthey're doing more than what a .app does.\n\n622\n00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.560\nAnd in fact, if they really wanted,\nthey could've compressed the files and\n\n623\n00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.140\nthen they wouldn't have ended in.app,\nthey would have ended in .pkg.\n\n624\n00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:31.193\nWhich, let's see, I should have, at least\none of these things should be a pkg.\n\n625\n00:28:31.193 --> 00:28:33.020\nActually I've got Adobe Air.\n\n626\n00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.210\nAdobe is great at doing crazy things.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n627\n00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.870\n&gt;&gt; And so it's a dmg,\n\n628\n00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:38.980\nan image file, right?\n\n629\n00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.840\nSo, I download an image file,\nI open it up.\n\n630\n00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.860\nAnd then here's the Adobe Air Installer,\nright?\n\n631\n00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.714\nSo, if we go and take a look at it.\n\n632\n00:28:48.729 --> 00:28:50.936\nAnd shoot, it is a dot app also.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n633\n00:28:50.936 --> 00:28:51.880\nhow about that?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n634\n00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, I will find a pkg.\n\n635\n00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:58.820\nIf you have things like printer drivers or\nany kind of hardware driver,\n\n636\n00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.450\nthose will always be, I shouldn't say\nalways, they will usually be a pkg.\n\n637\n00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:06.294\nIf it is a dot app like this, usually\nif you browse inside of it, you'll find\n\n638\n00:29:06.294 --> 00:29:08.956\nwhere there is a pkg in there somewhere.\n&gt;&gt; I suppose\n\n639\n00:29:08.956 --> 00:29:12.289\nyou didn't have one before\nthe dongle that goes on to\n\n640\n00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:15.005\nyour Sysco devices.\n&gt;&gt; You know, I don't think I've plugged it\n\n641\n00:29:15.005 --> 00:29:16.315\nin on this Mac mini yet.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n642\n00:29:16.315 --> 00:29:18.550\n&gt;&gt; Cuz this is a fairly new one, so yeah,\n\n643\n00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:19.780\nit hasn't been loaded.\n\n644\n00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.878\nSome of these other ones, let's see.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n645\n00:29:23.878 --> 00:29:25.850\n&gt;&gt; The other thing is when you run stuff,\n\n646\n00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:29.242\nthey started with either Sierra or\nit might have been El Capitan,\n\n647\n00:29:29.242 --> 00:29:31.894\nwhere they started saying\nlike after the install,\n\n648\n00:29:31.894 --> 00:29:34.086\ndo you want to delete the install file?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n649\n00:29:34.086 --> 00:29:34.920\n&gt;&gt; You don't need it anymore.\n\n650\n00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.040\nI usually say yes.\n\n651\n00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.470\nSo, I don't have a huge\narchive of install files,\n\n652\n00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.110\nbut you will see variations like that.\n\n653\n00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.230\nYou'll see those pkgs, they're out there.\n\n654\n00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:47.100\nThat usually indicates it's a driver,\nyou install it,\n\n655\n00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.520\nthen you don't necessarily\nneed it anymore.\n\n656\n00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.970\nAnything that runs a service\nmight also do that.\n\n657\n00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:57.620\nLet me see if, I've got the VNC viewer,\nbut not the VNC server.\n\n658\n00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.340\nThat one would've been a pkg.\n\n659\n00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.063\nYeah, you'll spot different ones.\n\n660\n00:30:02.063 --> 00:30:05.860\nLet's see if this Flash Player Installer,\nmaybe it's at pkg.\n\n661\n00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:09.010\nProbably not, probably gonna regret this.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n662\n00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:10.541\n&gt;&gt; Way to really go for it though.\n\n663\n00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:11.290\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n664\n00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.550\n&gt;&gt; Will not be deterred.\n\n665\n00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:15.580\n&gt;&gt; Shoot, what is that one called?\n\n666\n00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.442\nWe'll take a look at this one more,\nif this one isn't it, then I give up, but\n\n667\n00:30:18.442 --> 00:30:19.650\nyou'll find this one is pkgs.\n\n668\n00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.620\nYou do need to be aware\nthat there is a different\n\n669\n00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.955\nfile name that you might come across.\n\n670\n00:30:24.955 --> 00:30:28.570\nNo that's a .app also,\nbut it is just .pkg.\n\n671\n00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.577\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don,\n\n672\n00:30:29.577 --> 00:30:33.181\nI know that actually we have a bit more to\ngo through, but I'm looking at our clock\n\n673\n00:30:33.181 --> 00:30:36.957\nand it's screaming no mas, so we're gonna\nhave to jump into a part two for this one.\n\n674\n00:30:36.957 --> 00:30:39.740\nDon, thanks so much for dropping by,\nI look forward to seeing that next part.\n\n675\n00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.540\nLook forward to seeing you good folks out\nthere as well, thanks for joining us.\n\n676\n00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.220\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n677\n00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:45.960\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n678\n00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.816\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n679\n00:30:46.816 --> 00:30:54.112\n[MUSIC]\n\n680\n00:30:54.112 --> 00:30:56.760\nThank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

Don shows how to view the hidden system folders and emphasizes some of the places in which the folders appear to be redundant. This redundancy is really about the scope of what is effected that is File Domains, according to Don. He also takes the time to point out special folders and what their importance is to the OS.",

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:13.964\n&gt;&gt; All right, greeting everyone,\n\n4\n00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:17.230\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of IT.Pro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.966\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n6\n00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:22.190\nin this epidose we're continuing\non with our ACSP series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.241\nJoining us in the studio yet\nagain for Part 2,\n\n8\n00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:29.243\nour conversation on interesting\nthings inside of your Mac.\n\n9\n00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:30.648\nI'm gonna just leave it at that.\n\n10\n00:00:30.648 --> 00:00:32.271\nHe's our good friend, Mr Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:33.416\nDon, welcome back, man, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:37.691\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thanks very much, and you know\nwe're diving back in Apple Certified for\n\n13\n00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:39.980\nProfessional tackling managing files.\n\n14\n00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.353\nWe talked about weird\nfiles in the last episode.\n\n15\n00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:44.225\nWe're gonna continue on with that and\nI need a moment to redeem myself.\n\n16\n00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:45.411\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because at the end\n\n17\n00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:48.046\nof the last episode we were\ntalking about applications.\n\n18\n00:00:48.046 --> 00:00:50.134\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And how they're really just folders\n\n19\n00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:51.220\nthat end in .app.\n\n20\n00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.547\nAnd I said well sometimes you\nget programs as PKGs, and\n\n21\n00:00:53.547 --> 00:00:55.578\nthen I totally failed to\nfind one that did that.\n\n22\n00:00:55.578 --> 00:00:56.314\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n23\n00:00:56.314 --> 00:00:59.971\nthat's thanks to Mac OS High Sierra's\nfeature where when you install a package\n\n24\n00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:03.736\nand you're done, it says hey, you want\nto delete the package, which it does, so\n\n25\n00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:04.679\nI didn't have one.\n\n26\n00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:09.870\nSo I did get one, I wanna show that to you\nguys so we can verify that I am not crazy.\n\n27\n00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.682\nSo here I'm just gonna go\ninto my downloads folder.\n\n28\n00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:15.108\nI actually mentioned in the last\nepisode the VNC server.\n\n29\n00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:18.866\nAnd so I went to their website, and\nI downloaded the real VNC server, and\n\n30\n00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.850\nsure enough you can see it right here.\n\n31\n00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.660\nIt's got a package icon,\nit adds .pkg, I'm redeemed!\n\n32\n00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.850\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n\n33\n00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.255\n&gt;&gt; So anyhow, too late for\nthe last episode, but\n\n34\n00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:32.464\nI did wanna show you guys that the final\nweirdness doesn't stop there, though.\n\n35\n00:01:32.464 --> 00:01:35.427\nWe've got more of them that we're taking\na look at right here in this episode as we\n\n36\n00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:37.710\nlook at some of our system folders and\nthings that are hidden.\n\n37\n00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.850\nAnd all sorts of stuff that Apple\ndecided you don't need to see.\n\n38\n00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.300\nSo they've hidden it away.\n\n39\n00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.543\nWe're gonna take a look at that\nright here in this episode.\n\n40\n00:01:46.543 --> 00:01:49.081\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don,\nI've dealt with enough users out there and\n\n41\n00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:51.280\ntheir logic is sound on this, I believe.\n\n42\n00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.295\nThat I've paid good money for\nthis machine and\n\n43\n00:01:54.295 --> 00:01:58.556\nwhy would you wanna hide anything from me,\nI own it, it's mine.\n\n44\n00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:01.450\nI'm the big dog,\nwhy are you hiding things from me?\n\n45\n00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.446\n&gt;&gt; All right, so this is one of those\nwhere when they sell you a Mac,\n\n46\n00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:08.706\nthey tell you it just works,\njust does what it does.\n\n47\n00:02:08.706 --> 00:02:14.389\nAnd the reason they're able to do that is,\nthey know there's some files that if they\n\n48\n00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:19.795\nshow them to you, the only thing you could\ndo with them is break the Mac, right?\n\n49\n00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:21.845\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if there's no real purpose for\n\n50\n00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:24.139\na user to get at them\nthey hide it away and\n\n51\n00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.920\nmake it where you don't\neven know it exists.\n\n52\n00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.745\nAnd that way, it protects that content and\nit's sure it doesn't get tampered with and\n\n53\n00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:30.256\nit's hidden.\n\n54\n00:02:30.256 --> 00:02:32.763\n&gt;&gt; It's got a little Wizard of\nOz thing going on there, right?\n\n55\n00:02:32.763 --> 00:02:34.127\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Don't pay any attention to the man\n\n56\n00:02:34.127 --> 00:02:34.946\nbehind the curtain.\n\n57\n00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there is a surprising amount of\n\n58\n00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.880\nhidden stuff inside a Mac OS.\n\n59\n00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.866\nThat again even if you know it's there,\nit doesn't really benefit you,\n\n60\n00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.660\nyou don't really mess around with it much.\n\n61\n00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.390\nBut it is nice to know that it's there,\nbecause sometimes things can get damaged.\n\n62\n00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.437\nOr if you're setting up a Mac as a server,\n\n63\n00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:55.080\nthere are times you need to get into\nthose hidden folders and work with it.\n\n64\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.600\nSo let me give you an example, right.\n\n65\n00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.036\nSo there's one example that something\nis hidden, I'll start with an easy one.\n\n66\n00:03:01.036 --> 00:03:06.344\nIf I go to my home folder, so here I am,\nI'm clicked on the folder, it's\n\n67\n00:03:06.344 --> 00:03:11.842\ngot my name on it and I see downloads,\nmovies, music, pictures and so on.\n\n68\n00:03:11.842 --> 00:03:15.940\nThere's folders in here that\nare more special than others.\n\n69\n00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.227\nOne of them's this applications folder.\n\n70\n00:03:17.227 --> 00:03:20.820\nIn fact, if you're following along at\nhome on your Mac you might not see that\n\n71\n00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.800\napplication folder there.\n\n72\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.505\nWhen you first create a user account they\ndon't have any applications tied just to\n\n73\n00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:27.264\ntheir account.\n\n74\n00:03:27.264 --> 00:03:31.920\nThey have the global applications,\nthe one that are in /applications.\n\n75\n00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.216\nBut if they install\na program that's just for\n\n76\n00:03:34.216 --> 00:03:37.365\nthem it will create an applications\nfolder in their profile.\n\n77\n00:03:37.365 --> 00:03:40.670\nAnd now they'll have applications that\nare just available for that user.\n\n78\n00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.530\nThat one's not hidden, if you don't\nsee it, it just hasn't been created.\n\n79\n00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.630\nIt doesn't exist, and\nso it doesn't show up.\n\n80\n00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.796\nSo sometimes it's not that it's hidden,\nit just hasn't been needed yet, all right.\n\n81\n00:03:48.796 --> 00:03:52.020\nThere's another folder in here\nthat's really important, and\n\n82\n00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.905\nthat's the library folder.\n\n83\n00:03:53.905 --> 00:03:57.857\nThere's a folder called library and that\nlibrary folder contains my preferences.\n\n84\n00:03:57.857 --> 00:04:01.090\nAll of personalizations and\ncustomization that I do.\n\n85\n00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.114\nThe fact that I picked this space\nbackground instead of some crazy mountain\n\n86\n00:04:04.114 --> 00:04:05.026\nI've never heard of.\n\n87\n00:04:05.026 --> 00:04:08.317\nThat kind of stuff is a preference\nI've set for my user account, and\n\n88\n00:04:08.317 --> 00:04:10.160\nthat's stored in the library.\n\n89\n00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.739\nIf I lost that library, it would\nbasically be like me starting over again.\n\n90\n00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.101\nI'd still have my documents, but\nall of my other preferences would be gone,\n\n91\n00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:19.790\nimportant folder.\n\n92\n00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.350\nSo they hide it, because if you just go\nin there you're gonna mess something up.\n\n93\n00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.980\nYou just leave it be, and\nthat's how it should be.\n\n94\n00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.300\nBut you can get at it if you want.\n\n95\n00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.066\nNot really well right from here, but\nif I use the Go menu up top, right.\n\n96\n00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:36.506\nWhen I click on that Go menu,\nand I look at my list of items,\n\n97\n00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:42.700\nI can see Documents, Desktop,\nHome and so on, I don't see Library.\n\n98\n00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.194\nBut if I hold the Option key on my\nkeyboard, see what happened there?\n\n99\n00:04:47.194 --> 00:04:48.016\n&gt;&gt; They're hiding that.\n\n100\n00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:50.218\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They are hiding that,\n\n101\n00:04:50.218 --> 00:04:53.446\nthe library folder is there,\nthe truth is out there.\n\n102\n00:04:53.446 --> 00:04:54.080\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n103\n00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.702\n&gt;&gt; And I can see it.\n\n104\n00:04:54.702 --> 00:04:56.415\n&gt;&gt; I want to believe.\n\n105\n00:04:56.415 --> 00:04:57.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if aliens land,\n\n106\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.440\nthey're landing right here\nin this library folder.\n\n107\n00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.770\nSo if I hold that option key though\nit shows up, I can click on it,\n\n108\n00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.360\nI can try and click on it and\nit's gonna take me to my library folder.\n\n109\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.486\nAnd if I look at my breadcrumb\ntrail down here, I can see macoshd,\n\n110\n00:05:13.486 --> 00:05:16.120\nusers, dpezet folder and then library.\n\n111\n00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.372\nI'm in the folder, and\nnow let's see, I'll search it jam.\n\n112\n00:05:20.372 --> 00:05:23.326\nSo all this stuff that's in here,\nincluding application support.\n\n113\n00:05:23.326 --> 00:05:26.794\nWhich is where we'll start to\nfind all the preferences for\n\n114\n00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:31.202\nour different programs that we run and\nthat we use, we customize things.\n\n115\n00:05:31.202 --> 00:05:33.706\nI think I talked about like\nHaroopad in another episode.\n\n116\n00:05:33.706 --> 00:05:35.617\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; So here's the Haroopad folder and\n\n117\n00:05:35.617 --> 00:05:40.090\nit will have my preferences for this\nparticular application stored in here.\n\n118\n00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.598\nAnd anything else that it's\ngot local storage, themes,\n\n119\n00:05:42.598 --> 00:05:44.400\ncaching that kind of stuff is all in here.\n\n120\n00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.316\nThis is an important folder, but it's\nhidden away because I should never have to\n\n121\n00:05:48.316 --> 00:05:51.050\ngo in there and mess with it,\nprograms do not me.\n\n122\n00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.699\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don,\nobviously Apple is hiding things for\n\n123\n00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.545\nus for good reasons not to try to keep\nthings secret but to just keep us from\n\n124\n00:05:57.545 --> 00:06:01.283\ngetting in there and accidentally\ndoing something we shouldn't do.\n\n125\n00:06:01.283 --> 00:06:05.500\nNow, that comes down to the user and\nthe user also hides stuff.\n\n126\n00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.102\nYou, how do you hide the fact that you\nhave a bunch of in on it, on your disk?\n\n127\n00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:10.997\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where are you putting that stuff?\n\n128\n00:06:10.997 --> 00:06:17.298\n&gt;&gt; All right, so it's actually somewhat\ndifficult, I shouldn't say it that way.\n\n129\n00:06:17.298 --> 00:06:20.230\nIf somewhat unintuitive,\nhow to hide something?\n\n130\n00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.943\nSo in the Mac GUI they don't really\ngive you a way to hide something, right.\n\n131\n00:06:24.943 --> 00:06:27.540\nFrom the command line you\nhave several ways, right.\n\n132\n00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.420\nFrom the GUI, though,\nyou can still use some of them.\n\n133\n00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.251\nThere's two main methods, right.\n\n134\n00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:34.770\nThere's the Mac way of doing it, and\nthere's the Unix way of doing it.\n\n135\n00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.104\nAnd oddly enough, from the GUI, the Unix\nway is the only way that's available,\n\n136\n00:06:38.104 --> 00:06:39.095\nit's kind of strange.\n\n137\n00:06:39.095 --> 00:06:41.120\nIt's like the opposite\nof what we'd expect.\n\n138\n00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.875\nSo let's say I'm in my home folder, and\nI need a safe place to keep my Enya.\n\n139\n00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:47.860\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n140\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.364\n&gt;&gt; And so\nI'm gonna come in here [LAUGH] and\n\n141\n00:06:49.364 --> 00:06:51.063\nI'm gonna create an Enya folder, right.\n\n142\n00:06:51.063 --> 00:06:54.738\nSo I'm just gonna create that one,\nEnya, we're gonna come sail away.\n\n143\n00:06:54.738 --> 00:06:57.452\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And [LAUGH] so I've got my Enya folder,\n\n144\n00:06:57.452 --> 00:07:00.780\nbut I don't want anybody\nto know I've got it.\n\n145\n00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.465\nSo in the Unix world, if you take\na folder or a file, anything, and\n\n146\n00:07:05.465 --> 00:07:09.314\nyou put a dot at the beginning\nof the name that dot says,\n\n147\n00:07:09.314 --> 00:07:14.031\ndon't show this to anybody,\nplease don't show this to anybody.\n\n148\n00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:15.003\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so\n\n149\n00:07:15.003 --> 00:07:18.011\nwhen you stick that dot on there-\n&gt;&gt; Your system to out you as\n\n150\n00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:18.681\nan Enya lover.\n\n151\n00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:20.239\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I press Enter and\n\n152\n00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:21.923\nit gets a little mad at me.\n\n153\n00:07:21.923 --> 00:07:25.415\nSee, it says you can't use a name that\nbegins with a dot because these names\n\n154\n00:07:25.415 --> 00:07:26.753\nare reserved in the system.\n\n155\n00:07:26.753 --> 00:07:28.760\nPlease choose another name, right?\n\n156\n00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.180\nIt's actually stopping me.\n\n157\n00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.200\nWell, it didn't always do that.\n\n158\n00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.856\nIn earlier versions you could actually\ndo it we can still do it from\n\n159\n00:07:33.856 --> 00:07:35.100\nthe command line.\n\n160\n00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.883\nBut that dot, what it's actually gonna\ndo is it's going to make it hidden.\n\n161\n00:07:38.883 --> 00:07:43.152\nAnd the reason they're stopping me\nis guess how I unhid it from the GUI\n\n162\n00:07:43.152 --> 00:07:45.180\nif it goes hidden?\n\n163\n00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.818\nYou don't, you can't.\n\n164\n00:07:45.818 --> 00:07:46.394\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's hidden.\n\n165\n00:07:46.394 --> 00:07:47.450\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's gone, yeah.\n\n166\n00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.863\n&gt;&gt; So they don't want to give you this\none-way trip to file gones-ville.\n\n167\n00:07:50.863 --> 00:07:51.974\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And-\n\n168\n00:07:51.974 --> 00:07:53.212\n&gt;&gt; That's how I've been\n\n169\n00:07:53.212 --> 00:07:54.650\ndeleting stuff, right?\n\n170\n00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.542\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so-\n&gt;&gt; Why is my disk still full?\n\n171\n00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:59.057\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] One way, and you're like yeah,\n\n172\n00:07:59.057 --> 00:08:02.290\nall this stuff is still actually hidden\nback there, you just don't know it.\n\n173\n00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.098\nSo if we wanna hide that,\nI can drop to the terminal.\n\n174\n00:08:06.098 --> 00:08:08.840\nAnd that's where I can\nreally get this stuff done.\n\n175\n00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.100\nSo I'm gonna do that,\nI'm gonna drop to the terminal.\n\n176\n00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.780\nAnd when you log into the terminal,\n\n177\n00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.610\nit does take you to your\nhome folder by default.\n\n178\n00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.580\nIf you type PWD,\n\n179\n00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.230\npresent working directory,\nI can see that I'm in /Users/dpezet.\n\n180\n00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.890\nAnd if I do an LS,\n\n181\n00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:27.160\nI can see that folder glowing right there,\npeople are gonna see that.\n\n182\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:27.670\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n183\n00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.591\n&gt;&gt; And they're gonna think boy,\nit shouldn't done be far more.\n\n184\n00:08:32.591 --> 00:08:37.000\nIf he's listing to any of them is,\nuntil I wanna change that, right?\n\n185\n00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.063\nSo, in the world,\nI can use the move command.\n\n186\n00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:45.105\nAnd I can say move Enya to .Enya.\n\n187\n00:08:45.105 --> 00:08:48.640\nStick in that dot at the beginning.\n\n188\n00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:54.110\nAnd when I do that, and\nI type LS, Enya's gone.\n\n189\n00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:01.090\nEnya's gone, and if I go back to my G.U.I.\nEnya's gone there as well.\n\n190\n00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.170\nBut not gone forever.\n\n191\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.500\nIt's still there, it's just hidden.\n\n192\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.700\nOkay, it still exist in\nthe unix level here.\n\n193\n00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:14.020\nI can do an LS-a, -a says show me\nall the files even the hidden ones.\n\n194\n00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.960\nAnd when I do that -a all\nsudden anya comes back.\n\n195\n00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.891\nAnd not just anya here's a bunch of\nother stuff that's hidden too .vnc,\n\n196\n00:09:21.891 --> 00:09:24.970\n.bashhistory, .cups.\n\n197\n00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.100\nEach of these, ,trash,\nmy Trash Can, there it is!\n\n198\n00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.030\nThat's where my trash goes, right?\n\n199\n00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.980\nI didn't know that, I didn't see that,\nbecause it was hidden.\n\n200\n00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.070\nThe dot is what did that, right?\n\n201\n00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.410\nThat's the Unix way.\n\n202\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.920\nLet me, I'm gonna move that back,\n\n203\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.620\nI'm gonna move .enya to regular old enya,\nright?\n\n204\n00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.420\nAnd so now it's back into my list again.\n\n205\n00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.920\nAnd eventually,\nthat'll show up in the GUI really fast.\n\n206\n00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.860\nSo there it is, so now that it's back.\n\n207\n00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.050\nIn the Mac world,\nwe can actually use chflags.\n\n208\n00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.080\nThere's a file flag that we can set.\n\n209\n00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.390\nAnd that file flag says hide this folder.\n\n210\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.520\nAll right, or hide this file.\n\n211\n00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.410\nYou can hide individual\nfiles the same way.\n\n212\n00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:08.630\nSo CH flags, this works by telling\nthe Mac OS extended file system,\n\n213\n00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.870\nor APFS, to hide the file for us.\n\n214\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.350\nNot with a dot in its name but\njust hide it, right.\n\n215\n00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.000\nThe library folder, for example, there's\nno dot at the beginning of its name.\n\n216\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.980\nIt's just the operating system\nhas been told to hide it.\n\n217\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.090\nIt has a flag set on it to hide it.\n\n218\n00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.250\nSo I can do chflags, and\n\n219\n00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:31.070\nI can set the hidden flag, and\nI'm going to tell it to do that on Enya.\n\n220\n00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.260\nAnd so when I run that it\nchanges the flag to hidden.\n\n221\n00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.780\nIf I go back to my GUI,\nthe Enya folder is gone.\n\n222\n00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.080\nBut in Unix, when I look\nthe annual folder is still there.\n\n223\n00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.420\nI didn't hide it the Unix way,\nI held it the Mac way.\n\n224\n00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.430\nI told the GUI to hide it.\n\n225\n00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:48.550\nThe terminal still has it.\n\n226\n00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.480\nSo this is usually the better way\nto go about it to come in and\n\n227\n00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.050\njust say that's what we wanna do.\n\n228\n00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.540\nAnd from the terminal\nthat's still available and\n\n229\n00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.530\nthat's basically way that one works.\n\n230\n00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.220\nThere's another flag called\n\n231\n00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.630\nno hidden which is how it would\nthen turn it back off again, right?\n\n232\n00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.160\nVersus the doc where you rename it and\nremove the dot here.\n\n233\n00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.680\nYou just do the note hidden\nflag to bring that back.\n\n234\n00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.750\nGood.\nSo that's\n\n235\n00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.050\nbasically how we work with the two\ndifferent ways for hiding it.\n\n236\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.940\nThere's not like a cool little check\nmark that we can hit, unfortunately.\n\n237\n00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.030\nBut, chflags, that'll lock it in.\n\n238\n00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.070\n&gt;&gt; All right, but my question was,\nif it's hidden from us?\n\n239\n00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.180\nI mean and the system is hidding it\nsaying, I don't want anybody to see this.\n\n240\n00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.280\nHow do we access it?\n\n241\n00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.110\nHow do we, you know?\n\n242\n00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:33.550\nHow do we go and say, het into this hidden\nthing that is like, behind the scenes.\n\n243\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.550\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nI've got my Enya folder, it's there.\n\n244\n00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.060\nI know it's there.\n\n245\n00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.290\n&gt;&gt; It's a hidden folder full\nof her greatest hits, right?\n\n246\n00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.376\n&gt;&gt; I'm ready to load up.\n\n247\n00:11:40.376 --> 00:11:42.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've got my Time Life collector's\n\n248\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.210\nedition 14-disc set.\n\n249\n00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.350\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n250\n00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.560\n&gt;&gt; I've gotta get that loaded in here,\nright?\n\n251\n00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.090\nBut I can see it.\n\n252\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.820\nFrom the terminal,\nI can navigate right into it.\n\n253\n00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.140\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But forget that, right?\n\n254\n00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.650\nHow do I get to it from the GUI?\n\n255\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.270\nWell, remember Library?\n\n256\n00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.520\nHow I'd go up here to this Go menu.\n\n257\n00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.860\nAnd in the Go menu I could hold\ndown Option and it would show up?\n\n258\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.290\nWell unfortunately they don't have\nan Enya shortcut for me, right?\n\n259\n00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.250\nAnd even if they did,\nare they gonna have Abba?\n\n260\n00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.390\nAre they gonna have like\nall of the greatest ones?\n\n261\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.892\nI don't know.\n\n262\n00:12:09.892 --> 00:12:10.680\n&gt;&gt; Yonni, I don't know.\n\n263\n00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.567\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, new age music, but.\n\n264\n00:12:11.567 --> 00:12:13.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, wait,\n\n265\n00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.598\nmy new age joke starts to\nbreak down a little bit.\n\n266\n00:12:15.598 --> 00:12:16.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n267\n00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:17.800\n&gt;&gt; But they don't have that.\n\n268\n00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.890\nBut they do have Go to Folder.\n\n269\n00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:26.370\nGo to Folder lets you type in\nthe folder you wanna go to.\n\n270\n00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.320\nSo I can type in whatever\nthat folder is going to be.\n\n271\n00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.590\nI know it's in my home directory.\n\n272\n00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:34.820\nI know it's in /users.\n\n273\n00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.940\nAnd you can use tab auto\ncomplete on this stuff or\n\n274\n00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.530\nit will automatically fill in for you.\n\n275\n00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.620\nSo as deep as that.\n\n276\n00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.250\nAnd then,\nI know that force called Inya, right.\n\n277\n00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.890\nAnd I can type it in,\neven tab auto complete found that.\n\n278\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:51.856\nAnd when I say go, it's gonna navigate and\nI can see in my bread.\n\n279\n00:12:51.856 --> 00:12:54.450\nI'm in that Inya folder, right,\nI can navigate right there.\n\n280\n00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.790\nSo you just use the Go to Folder option,\nand type in the name.\n\n281\n00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.500\nIt's hidden, so yeah, I can't click to it.\n\n282\n00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.750\nBut I can browse just like this,\nnow I'm in it.\n\n283\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:08.575\nI can load up all of my MP3s or\nAACs or whatever it is they have.\n\n284\n00:13:08.575 --> 00:13:09.525\nYou know, chuck all that in there.\n\n285\n00:13:09.525 --> 00:13:11.195\nOf course I've gonna have Flack.\n\n286\n00:13:11.195 --> 00:13:13.238\nBecause I need the high quality.\n\n287\n00:13:13.238 --> 00:13:13.890\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n288\n00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So anyway [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Ambience, right?\n\n289\n00:13:17.605 --> 00:13:19.145\n&gt;&gt; It's important.\n\n290\n00:13:19.145 --> 00:13:21.565\nAs you're drifting off into sleep.\n\n291\n00:13:22.605 --> 00:13:25.605\nSo we need to put all that information,\nor be able to get there so we can use it.\n\n292\n00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:27.925\nAnd so\nfrom the GUI we do actually have one way.\n\n293\n00:13:27.925 --> 00:13:29.230\nWe have that go to folder.\n\n294\n00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:30.280\nWe can get there and we can throw it.\n\n295\n00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.410\nSo it's just a simple way to get it.\n\n296\n00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.500\n&gt;&gt; I know you really wanna get to\nlighting some aroma therapy candles and\n\n297\n00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.900\ngetting that disk uploaded.\n\n298\n00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.780\nBut continuing down\nthe vein of hidden folders,\n\n299\n00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.240\nare there any other hidden folders or\nfiles.\n\n300\n00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.330\nThings of that nature that we\nneed to be aware of for the exam?\n\n301\n00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.700\nActually, there is a ton of hidden things,\nif you go poking\n\n302\n00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.200\naround in the file system-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You just\n\n303\n00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.705\nopened Pandora's Box, right?\n\n304\n00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But there are a handful that I do want\n\n305\n00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.010\nto point out.\n\n306\n00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.840\nLet me get out of this,\nI'm gonna forget that Enya folder.\n\n307\n00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.252\nAnd a year from now I'm gonna find that-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What is this Enya there?\n\n308\n00:14:00.252 --> 00:14:00.870\n&gt;&gt; The heck is this?\n\n309\n00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:01.940\nWho put Enya on my computer?\n\n310\n00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:07.420\nAll right, if I navigate just to\nthe Macintosh HD, to my hard drive.\n\n311\n00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.570\nWhen I go to that hard drive.\n\n312\n00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.980\nSo I'm in the disk,\nI see applications Applications, Library,\n\n313\n00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.910\nSystem, Users, four whole folders.\n\n314\n00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.760\nPretty clean file system, right?\n\n315\n00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.680\nApplications that's where\nmy programs go that I run.\n\n316\n00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.490\nLibrary, that's where the global\nsystem preferences go.\n\n317\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.020\nRemember we have a library for\nus, for the user.\n\n318\n00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.370\nThere's a library for\nthe system as well, right?\n\n319\n00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.180\nThen I see system,\nthat's where the operating system is.\n\n320\n00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.010\nThat's where Mac OS or\nOS X in the older versions, are stored.\n\n321\n00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.220\nUsers, that's where the user profiles are.\n\n322\n00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.320\nThere's only four folders here and\nI know exactly what each one of them does.\n\n323\n00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.280\nAnd I also know that I really shouldn't\nbe messing around with this one,\n\n324\n00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.130\nthe system folder.\n\n325\n00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.500\nSo some of these I shouldn't mess with but\n\n326\n00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.510\nthey're at least displayed and\nI can see them.\n\n327\n00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.290\nRight?\n\n328\n00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.680\nThere's actually a lot of things in this\ndirectory that we're not even seeing.\n\n329\n00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.560\nIf I navigate to my root\nfilesystem in the command line.\n\n330\n00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:02.790\nAnd I'm gonna do an ls -a,\nI'm gonna see those four folders.\n\n331\n00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.940\nAnd I'm going to see a few other things,\nright.\n\n332\n00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:10.250\nLet me do a la so that we can tell\nwhat's a folder and what's a file.\n\n333\n00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.130\nSo looking at it I see Applications,\nLibrary,\n\n334\n00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.130\nSystem, Users, there's those four.\n\n335\n00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.210\nI also see volumes,\nwhere any media is mounted.\n\n336\n00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.610\nI see network, that one was hidden.\n\n337\n00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:28.830\nWe've got bin, cores, dev, etc,\nhome, net, private, sbin, USR.\n\n338\n00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.170\nAll those are folders,\nall of them are hidden, right?\n\n339\n00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.710\nThe majority of these have weird names,\nright?\n\n340\n00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:35.780\nUSR, what the heck is that?\n\n341\n00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.250\nI've already got a user folder,\nwhat's this USR?\n\n342\n00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.810\nWell that's from the unix world.\n\n343\n00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.890\nAnd the unix world when\nyou install an application\n\n344\n00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.460\nif it's an operating system\napplication it would go in slash bin.\n\n345\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.326\nIf it's a application\nthat any user can use but\n\n346\n00:15:49.326 --> 00:15:52.572\npart of the operating system\nwanna go in slash s bin.\n\n347\n00:15:52.572 --> 00:15:55.174\nBut if it's an application\nthat we just install and\n\n348\n00:15:55.174 --> 00:15:58.937\nthen like it goes in slash usr or\nsometimes slash opt which it isn't here.\n\n349\n00:15:58.937 --> 00:16:02.059\nSo these are the different\nfolders from the Unix world, and\n\n350\n00:16:02.059 --> 00:16:05.130\nApple says, hey we're not\nreally doing this Unix thing.\n\n351\n00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.327\nWe want it to be easy.\n\n352\n00:16:06.327 --> 00:16:07.710\nSo they just hide all this.\n\n353\n00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.700\nYou don't need to see it.\n\n354\n00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.186\nA lot of it's aliased anyway, or\nkind of links to some other location.\n\n355\n00:16:12.186 --> 00:16:16.665\nBut all this stuff gets hidden,\nbecause we shouldn't mess with it, right?\n\n356\n00:16:16.665 --> 00:16:19.390\nAnd That's pretty much the rule.\n\n357\n00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.565\n&gt;&gt; Even the common theme.\n\n358\n00:16:20.565 --> 00:16:22.537\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even if you're a sysadmin you know\n\n359\n00:16:22.537 --> 00:16:26.520\nexactly what you're doing, it's a rare day\nyou would mess with any of these folders.\n\n360\n00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.349\nIn fact, the only time I ever do is\nwhen I'm setting up my Mac as a server.\n\n361\n00:16:30.349 --> 00:16:33.515\nWhen I'm running the server app, you're\nactually using some of the BSD services.\n\n362\n00:16:33.515 --> 00:16:37.055\nAnd you may need to get in there and\nmess around with stuff a little bit,\n\n363\n00:16:37.055 --> 00:16:41.315\nespecially ETC, but otherwise this stuff\nneeds to be hands off, so it's hidden and\n\n364\n00:16:41.315 --> 00:16:42.403\nit's out of the way.\n\n365\n00:16:42.403 --> 00:16:45.004\nThose four that show up by default,\n\n366\n00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:49.176\nthose are kind of important\nto know what they do, right?\n\n367\n00:16:49.176 --> 00:16:53.951\nBut each of these different components\nserves a purpose, and some are hidden,\n\n368\n00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:58.100\nsome aren't, but you can get at any\nof them if you know where to look.\n\n369\n00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:03.529\n&gt;&gt; So Don, just made me think, why is the\nlibrary folder is hidden in the go menu.\n\n370\n00:17:03.529 --> 00:17:07.790\n&gt;&gt; All right so\nlibrary it's hidden in our home folder.\n\n371\n00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:08.950\nIt's hidden in the Go menu,\n\n372\n00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.680\nbut if I just browse to the hard\ndrive I see library right there.\n\n373\n00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.190\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n374\n00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.220\nIt's not even hidden.\n\n375\n00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.016\nWhy did they do that, right?\n\n376\n00:17:16.016 --> 00:17:20.040\nThe reason is There's actually\nmore than one library folder.\n\n377\n00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.310\nThere could be as many as\nfour library folders, right?\n\n378\n00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.380\nThere could be four application folders.\n\n379\n00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.228\nThere could be four of a number\nof these folders, right?\n\n380\n00:17:28.228 --> 00:17:31.690\nWhen we deal with the file system,\nApple uses what are called domains.\n\n381\n00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:36.940\nDomains are like boundaries on a file,\nso if I have an application and\n\n382\n00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.140\nI want it to be available to\neverybody who uses my computer.\n\n383\n00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.910\nIt goes in /applications, right?\n\n384\n00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:47.690\nHang on let me get back to my terminal.\n\n385\n00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:52.821\nIn my root we have /applications,\n\n386\n00:17:52.821 --> 00:17:57.960\nand if I look at /applications I can look\nat all the programs that are available.\n\n387\n00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.876\nFor everyone on my system.\n\n388\n00:17:59.876 --> 00:18:05.539\nBut then in my home directory,\nif I look in /users/dpezet/applications,\n\n389\n00:18:05.539 --> 00:18:10.290\nhere I'm gonna see applications\nthat are just available for me.\n\n390\n00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:15.570\nI've only got one, Pro Maps, that's the,\nChrome was doing this offline app thing.\n\n391\n00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.397\nThey don't supported it anymore, so\nI'm surprised it's still there, but\n\n392\n00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:19.274\nthey created that one.\n\n393\n00:18:19.274 --> 00:18:21.966\nThat's an application that's\njust there for me, right?\n\n394\n00:18:21.966 --> 00:18:25.550\nTwo different applications folders,\nthat'll create confusion, won't it?\n\n395\n00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.214\nRight, the Library folder is in\nmy home directory is just for\n\n396\n00:18:28.214 --> 00:18:31.557\nme, and I really shouldn't be messing\nwith it because I should be setting my\n\n397\n00:18:31.557 --> 00:18:33.566\npreferences and stuff through my programs.\n\n398\n00:18:33.566 --> 00:18:35.547\nThe library folder that's global, though,\n\n399\n00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:39.400\nI'm not gonna have permission to mess\nwith it unless I'm an administrator.\n\n400\n00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.550\nAnd as an administrator I may want\nto change preferences that affect\n\n401\n00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:43.495\nthe entire system.\n\n402\n00:18:43.495 --> 00:18:45.653\nAnd so they leave that one\nvisible because you know,\n\n403\n00:18:45.653 --> 00:18:48.150\na regular user can't even\nmess with anyway, right?\n\n404\n00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.297\nBut those domains are important.\n\n405\n00:18:49.297 --> 00:18:53.760\nSo, let me highlight the four\ndifferent domains that are available.\n\n406\n00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.930\nI'm gonna use library as the example.\n\n407\n00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:01.005\nBecause with library we really have these\ntwo libraries that are there by default,\n\n408\n00:19:01.005 --> 00:19:01.528\nright?\n\n409\n00:19:01.528 --> 00:19:07.297\nSo there's /library, right, that's\nthe one that's in the root of our system.\n\n410\n00:19:07.297 --> 00:19:11.497\nAnd then there's the one that's\ninside of our individual folder,\n\n411\n00:19:11.497 --> 00:19:16.607\nwhich is /users/, whatever your username\nhappens to be, /library, right?\n\n412\n00:19:16.607 --> 00:19:20.238\nSo there's two libraries.\n\n413\n00:19:20.238 --> 00:19:24.710\nYou may have a third\nlibrary inside of system.\n\n414\n00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.150\nOkay?\nNow that would be one that's controlled\n\n415\n00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:27.920\nby Apple.\n\n416\n00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.629\nRight?\nThis is one that's part of macOS when you\n\n417\n00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:36.887\ninstall macOS it may create\na library inside of /system.\n\n418\n00:19:36.887 --> 00:19:40.790\nAnd if I look inside of /system\nsure enough there it is library.\n\n419\n00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:43.796\nAll right?\nAnd then the last one you may or\n\n420\n00:19:43.796 --> 00:19:47.750\nmay not have, would be inside of /network.\n\n421\n00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.060\nNow for most of us,\n\n422\n00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:55.020\nnetwork is gonna be empty, unless\nyou've installed the Mac OS Server app.\n\n423\n00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.473\nI've installed the server app,\nso I have a servers folder.\n\n424\n00:19:58.473 --> 00:20:02.631\nAnd if I go inside of servers, I'll start\nto see the configurations and things for\n\n425\n00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:06.020\nthe various services that I\nmight be running, all right?\n\n426\n00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.236\nAnd as you configure server,\nif you tweak preferences,\n\n427\n00:20:09.236 --> 00:20:12.325\na library folder will appear here as well,\nall right?\n\n428\n00:20:12.325 --> 00:20:17.883\nSo, if we kind of recap\nall that basically what\n\n429\n00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:23.740\nwe've got are these\nfour different domains.\n\n430\n00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:28.381\nAnd I'm using library as an example but\nthe same would be true if I'm talking\n\n431\n00:20:28.381 --> 00:20:33.109\nabout like the applications folder\ncould appear in these different places.\n\n432\n00:20:33.109 --> 00:20:35.389\nSo there was /library.\n\n433\n00:20:35.389 --> 00:20:39.987\nThere was /users/dpezet/library,\n\n434\n00:20:39.987 --> 00:20:44.043\nthere was /system/library, and\n\n435\n00:20:44.043 --> 00:20:49.190\nthere was /network/library, all right.\n\n436\n00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.924\nWhen it looks for the preferences of an\napplication it looks in all four of these\n\n437\n00:20:53.924 --> 00:20:57.596\nplaces and they're applied in\na particular order, right?\n\n438\n00:20:57.596 --> 00:21:02.269\nIt basically looks and says the users\nlibrary folder is the most important one,\n\n439\n00:21:02.269 --> 00:21:04.520\nright, I should've put that first.\n\n440\n00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.128\nThat's the most important one.\n\n441\n00:21:06.128 --> 00:21:09.893\nAnd if we can't find preferences there\nthen we move down to whats called\n\n442\n00:21:09.893 --> 00:21:12.930\nthe local library, or\nthe one that applies globally.\n\n443\n00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.151\nRight, so /library.\n\n444\n00:21:14.151 --> 00:21:18.976\nAnd if can't find one there then it\ngoes to the network library if we've got\n\n445\n00:21:18.976 --> 00:21:23.648\nthe server app installed, and only if\nall three of those fail does it go to\n\n446\n00:21:23.648 --> 00:21:27.010\nthe last library which\nis the system library.\n\n447\n00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.400\nThose would be the defaults from Apple,\nright?\n\n448\n00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.810\nAnd that's the order\nthat it parses through.\n\n449\n00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.520\nAnd so they don't want users to have to\nworry about all these different library\n\n450\n00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.830\ndirectories, they hide it, right?\n\n451\n00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.470\nThey don't want you to have to worry\nabout each of these different domains.\n\n452\n00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:39.734\nThe domains get confusing,\n\n453\n00:21:39.734 --> 00:21:42.375\nwhy bother people with stuff\nlike this that's confusing?\n\n454\n00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:46.370\nBut it is real, right, these four library\nfolders all serve the same purpose.\n\n455\n00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.495\nThey just affect\na different scope of user.\n\n456\n00:21:48.495 --> 00:21:52.436\n&gt;&gt; So the Mac operating system knows which\ndomain to use by just basically swiping\n\n457\n00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:56.614\nthrough each one, or it has some mechanism\nthat says well, you want to use this, or\n\n458\n00:21:56.614 --> 00:21:57.708\nyou want to use that?\n\n459\n00:21:57.708 --> 00:21:59.900\n&gt;&gt; So usually, it just knows.\n\n460\n00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.522\nRight?\nThey've programmed it so\n\n461\n00:22:01.522 --> 00:22:04.900\nwhen it performs operations,\nit knows which of these domains to hit.\n\n462\n00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.685\nWhen you install a third-party\napplication Inside of that bundle of app.\n\n463\n00:22:09.685 --> 00:22:13.017\nIf you browse inside of it,\nthere's a package info file,\n\n464\n00:22:13.017 --> 00:22:16.553\nwhich they call it manifest, and\nit has instructions in it and\n\n465\n00:22:16.553 --> 00:22:20.720\nit says this goes in the global domain or\nthis goes into user domain.\n\n466\n00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.900\nAnd so it knows where to put it.\n\n467\n00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.550\nChrome had that application that was\nin my user's application folder.\n\n468\n00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:26.496\nThat was in their manifest.\n\n469\n00:22:26.496 --> 00:22:28.180\nIt said put this in with the user.\n\n470\n00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.296\nDon't put it globally, and\nso that it instructs them.\n\n471\n00:22:31.296 --> 00:22:34.828\nAs a user, we usually won't\nhave to interrupt with that, or\n\n472\n00:22:34.828 --> 00:22:36.160\ninterfere with that.\n\n473\n00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.226\nI can give you an example though.\n\n474\n00:22:38.226 --> 00:22:43.740\nLet's say that I'm\ninstalling a program like.\n\n475\n00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.043\nWell, like a pkg, package, right?\n\n476\n00:22:46.043 --> 00:22:46.856\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n477\n00:22:46.856 --> 00:22:50.350\n&gt;&gt; If I'm installing a package,\nwell, that's a driver.\n\n478\n00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.907\nDrivers are different than like,\nan application.\n\n479\n00:22:53.907 --> 00:22:56.215\nApplications just go in\nthe applications folder, but\n\n480\n00:22:56.215 --> 00:22:58.570\na pkg could install stuff\nall over the place.\n\n481\n00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.538\nAnd so, there'll be instructions in\nthat pkg to tell it where to go.\n\n482\n00:23:01.538 --> 00:23:06.244\nWell At the very beginning of this episode\nI actually showed the [CROSSTALK].\n\n483\n00:23:06.244 --> 00:23:08.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The VNC Server, right?\n\n484\n00:23:08.688 --> 00:23:12.480\nAnd I run the VNC Server,\nit's actually running right up here.\n\n485\n00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.190\nBecause sometimes I'm in my office and\n\n486\n00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:15.680\nI wanna connect over to this Mac Mini or\nwhatever.\n\n487\n00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.430\nSo I've got it, it's here, it's running.\n\n488\n00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.701\nVery, very exciting, right?\n\n489\n00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:22.022\nNow when it installed it copied\nstuff to several different places,\n\n490\n00:23:22.022 --> 00:23:24.780\nnot just one place but\nseveral different places.\n\n491\n00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.835\nAnd so they had to tell it\nwhere to copy of all of that.\n\n492\n00:23:26.835 --> 00:23:30.680\nAnd if we wanted to poke around and\ntry and find some of that stuff we could.\n\n493\n00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.994\nBut most of it should\nhave gone into /library.\n\n494\n00:23:34.994 --> 00:23:38.140\nAnd that's where preferences and\nthings like that will end up.\n\n495\n00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.558\nNow inside of /library there's a lot more,\nright?\n\n496\n00:23:41.558 --> 00:23:46.437\nThe preferences, those are usually\nstored inside of application support or\n\n497\n00:23:46.437 --> 00:23:47.570\nin Preferences.\n\n498\n00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:48.919\nThere's gonna be a folder\ncalled preferences.\n\n499\n00:23:48.919 --> 00:23:51.480\nIt's gonna be in one of those two places,\nright?\n\n500\n00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.207\nAfter that, though, there's other\nthings like frameworks, okay?\n\n501\n00:23:55.207 --> 00:23:56.437\nWhat's a framework?\n\n502\n00:23:56.437 --> 00:24:00.595\nWell, maybe I have an application\nthat depends on Java or Ruby or\n\n503\n00:24:00.595 --> 00:24:03.480\nApple Script or something like that.\n\n504\n00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.520\nThose frameworks get installed here.\n\n505\n00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.970\nThose are elements that can\nbe shared amongst programs.\n\n506\n00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.500\nI don't have to install Java each\ntime I have a Java application.\n\n507\n00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.640\nI install it once, and\nit's available for everybody.\n\n508\n00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.811\nJava's another example of a PKG,\nI could have downloaded that one.\n\n509\n00:24:16.811 --> 00:24:17.345\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n510\n00:24:17.345 --> 00:24:18.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n511\n00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.550\nit's going to install in\nthat frameworks folder.\n\n512\n00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:26.060\nLogs, there's a logs folder right here\nwhere the applications are going to log to\n\n513\n00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.410\nwhen error occurs or\nwhatever will dump to that.\n\n514\n00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:29.940\nDoes it go to the users log or\n\n515\n00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:34.740\ndoes it go to the global log,\nright, the local/library/logs.\n\n516\n00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.890\nThey have to dictate that, right, that's\nanother area where they're gonna drop to.\n\n517\n00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:43.830\nThere's other things that you may\nfind at one level and not at another.\n\n518\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.490\nFor example, startup items, okay.\n\n519\n00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.480\nStartup items is a really interesting one,\n\n520\n00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.970\nmostly because you're not really\nsupposed to use it anymore.\n\n521\n00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:54.390\nBut it's still there for\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n522\n00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:58.800\nInside of your library folder,\nthe one that is part of your user profile,\n\n523\n00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:04.570\nif something's in startup items that means\nwhen I log in, run these programs, right?\n\n524\n00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:09.350\nWhen I log in, but here at the global\nlevel, it's saying when the computer boots\n\n525\n00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.535\nup, run these programs,\nregardless of who logs in.\n\n526\n00:25:12.535 --> 00:25:16.310\nOe even if nobody logs in,\nI want you to run these programs.\n\n527\n00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:19.610\nIt's the same folder, but\nit does two different things.\n\n528\n00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.690\nSo in the olden days,\nif I wanted an application to start up,\n\n529\n00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:24.160\nI would have to make that decision.\n\n530\n00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.080\nDo I want it to start when a user logs in,\nor\n\n531\n00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.030\ndo I want it to start\nwhen the system boots up?\n\n532\n00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:32.170\nAnd have to put it in the appropriate\nstartup items folder.\n\n533\n00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.008\nNow we have a launch D that drives that,\nand\n\n534\n00:25:34.008 --> 00:25:36.468\nDaniel can do a whole show on\nhow easy that is to work with.\n\n535\n00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:37.664\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fun.\n\n536\n00:25:37.664 --> 00:25:41.920\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that's kind of the purpose there.\n\n537\n00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.390\nSo when we have to get involved,\nit can be a little hard, but\n\n538\n00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.660\nfortunately we don't normally\nhave to get involved with it.\n\n539\n00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.190\nAnd the areas where we do,\n\n540\n00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:52.670\nApple usually gives us some kind\nof a tool to make that easy.\n\n541\n00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.880\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, what would be a good example\nof when we would need to get involved,\n\n542\n00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.692\nknow that domain?\n\n543\n00:25:56.692 --> 00:26:00.444\n&gt;&gt; Sure, applications usually\nfigure it out on their own,\n\n544\n00:26:00.444 --> 00:26:03.750\nbut I know one thing that doesn't, fonts.\n\n545\n00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.790\nLet's say you go and\nyou download a font, right?\n\n546\n00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:08.840\nSo you've got the fonts that\ncome with an Apple and you're\n\n547\n00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.470\nmaybe not happy with them, or you have\nsome special font you wanna use, right?\n\n548\n00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.730\nSo you've gotta use this font.\n\n549\n00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:16.850\nSo you go online, you download the TTF\nfile, and you're ready to load, okay.\n\n550\n00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.160\nWell you can just double-click on\nthe font and it'll install it and\n\n551\n00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.900\nthat's that, right?\n\n552\n00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.620\nBut is it installed just for you, or\n\n553\n00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.790\nis it installed for\neveryone on the computer, right?\n\n554\n00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:28.850\nHow do you make that decision?\n\n555\n00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.170\nWell if you just double-click on it,\nthe system guesses.\n\n556\n00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:32.699\nAnd it says, maybe you?\n\n557\n00:26:32.699 --> 00:26:35.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, that might not be what we want.\n\n558\n00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.300\nSo instead of just\ndouble-clicking on that,\n\n559\n00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.700\nwhat we could do is we could\ngo into the Font Book.\n\n560\n00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.340\nSo in your Utilities you have\nan application called Font Book.\n\n561\n00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.550\nIt's part of MacOS by default,\nI didn't install it.\n\n562\n00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.970\nIt's actually been a round a long time.\n\n563\n00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.190\nThis is the Font Book,\nyou can see all your fonts for\n\n564\n00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:52.435\npeople that really care about this stuff.\n\n565\n00:26:52.435 --> 00:26:56.103\nAnd, you can see them, pretty cool, right?\n\n566\n00:26:56.103 --> 00:26:57.055\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n567\n00:26:57.055 --> 00:26:59.697\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is the mind numbing technology\n\n568\n00:26:59.697 --> 00:27:01.610\nwe're talking about today.\n\n569\n00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.850\nBut if I want to load in\na custom font I can do it.\n\n570\n00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:06.750\nI can actually just drag and\ndrop it on this screen, or\n\n571\n00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.960\nI can hit the + up here and add it in.\n\n572\n00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.495\nBut if I go into the preferences of this\napplication, so I go up here to Font Book\n\n573\n00:27:12.495 --> 00:27:16.820\n&gt; Preferences, in the preferences,\nI can pick a default install location.\n\n574\n00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.000\nAll right, and here when I drop it down,\nsee how it just says User and Computer?\n\n575\n00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:29.580\nWhat it really should say is\n/Users/dpezet/Library/Fonts or\n\n576\n00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.950\n/Library/Fonts, right?\n\n577\n00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:37.150\nThat's effectively what these\ntwo items map to, right?\n\n578\n00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.950\nIs it going to go into the Fonts\nfolder in my library or\n\n579\n00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.280\nthe one globally for everybody?\n\n580\n00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.530\nRight, and it tells you that, but\nit's kind of masking that complexity.\n\n581\n00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.780\nAgain, a regular end user\nwouldn't even know that\n\n582\n00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.690\nthere was duplication here, right?\n\n583\n00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.840\nThat this is really mapping\nto some other folder,\n\n584\n00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.460\nthey just see this easy entry, right?\n\n585\n00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.200\nAnd speaking of duplicates this\none even has the feature to say\n\n586\n00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.080\nif the font already exists globally,\nthere's no need to add it to a user.\n\n587\n00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.187\nSo we can just delete the user's version.\n\n588\n00:28:06.187 --> 00:28:08.787\nSo now we just have one copy, it can\nclean that stuff up or it can leave it,\n\n589\n00:28:08.787 --> 00:28:11.260\nit can leave it where there's two copies,\nup to you.\n\n590\n00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.830\nThis is an example where they've given\nus a tool that makes that decision easy,\n\n591\n00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.140\nwithout even showing\nus those folder names.\n\n592\n00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:22.080\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, obviously managing files\nhas quite a bit of complexity to it,\n\n593\n00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.480\nbut we've managed to go\nthrough hopefully all of it.\n\n594\n00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.770\nI don't know of any other parts or any\nother objectives that we need to cover.\n\n595\n00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.290\nThat being said, Don,\n\n596\n00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.810\nis there anything else that we need to\nknow that comes to mind [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n597\n00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.760\n&gt;&gt; Most of the folders that are hidden,\nif they ever do get damaged or whatever,\n\n598\n00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.640\nwhen you reinstall MacOS, they get fixed.\n\n599\n00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that's the nice part.\n\n600\n00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.570\nIf you hide your own stuff,\nthough, that's up to you, right?\n\n601\n00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:44.670\nThe ball's in your court.\n\n602\n00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.590\nSo do be aware, if you start hiding\nthings, it can mess with things.\n\n603\n00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:51.660\nTime machine will still back them up even\nif they're hidden, so that's good to know.\n\n604\n00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:57.010\nBut otherwise, that's about it for\nour main kind of system and core folders.\n\n605\n00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:58.630\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don,\nthanks for dropping by.\n\n606\n00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:01.470\nThanks for explaining how we can\nmanage files inside of Mac OS.\n\n607\n00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.060\nWe do thank you good folks out there for\nwatching.\n\n608\n00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.020\nHopefully you got a lot\nout of this episode.\n\n609\n00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.430\nBut, we are at the time to call it a day.\n\n610\n00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.590\nThanks for watching yet again,\nsigning off for ITProTV,\n\n611\n00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:11.240\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n612\n00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.073\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n613\n00:29:12.073 --> 00:29:14.309\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n614\n00:29:14.309 --> 00:29:20.312\n[MUSIC]\n\n615\n00:29:20.312 -->

00:00:12.560\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n4\n00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.390\nthank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.520\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\n\n6\n00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.026\nas we continue on with\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n7\n00:00:21.026 --> 00:00:23.836\nArchives and\nImages is the title of this episode, and\n\n8\n00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:26.280\nwe're gonna hear all\nabout it from Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.710\nDon, great to have you here.\n&gt;&gt; And great to be back, Zach.\n\n10\n00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.630\nAnd like you said, we're gonna be\nlooking at archives and images.\n\n11\n00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.470\nIf you ever had to transfer multiple\nfiles across the Internet either as like\n\n12\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.820\nan email attachment, or upload to\na service like Dropbox or iCloud.\n\n13\n00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.360\nYou know that it can be difficult\nworking with a large quantity of files.\n\n14\n00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.240\nSo, the majority of the time,\nwe'll take those files and\n\n15\n00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.540\nput them into an archive of some sort.\n\n16\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.760\nAn archive that allows us to compress\nthe files to make them smaller as well as\n\n17\n00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.560\nbundle them together into a single file,\nwhich is far easier to transmit and\n\n18\n00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.630\nmake sure that it gets to\nits destination intact.\n\n19\n00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.020\nSo, we're gonna look at some of\nthe ways that you can do that\n\n20\n00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.050\nright from inside of macOS.\n&gt;&gt; Well, do we install any software in\n\n21\n00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.070\norder to work with the archives?\n&gt;&gt; Well, you certainly can, and\n\n22\n00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.170\nI'll fess up here that I normally do.\n\n23\n00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.640\nI have a little program that I use\non macOS that is called Entropy,\n\n24\n00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.020\nthat I like, it is a archive\napplication that generates,\n\n25\n00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.540\nreally any type of archive\nthat you want to use.\n\n26\n00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.010\nDrag the files and drop it on there,\nand it works really well.\n\n27\n00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.374\nReally negative, it hasn't been updated in\na few years, which is disappointing, but\n\n28\n00:01:32.374 --> 00:01:33.657\nit does a really really good job.\n\n29\n00:01:33.657 --> 00:01:38.064\nBut you don't have to buy anything,\nmacOS has native support for\n\n30\n00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:43.560\na number of archive types, and you can\njust do it from right inside of the OS.\n\n31\n00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.960\nFor example, the most popular\narchive format in the world\n\n32\n00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.400\nis the zip archive.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n33\n00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.260\n&gt;&gt; Zip was a container type format\n\n34\n00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.180\nthat was developed back in the late 1980s,\nearly 1990s by a company called PKWare.\n\n35\n00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.270\nAnd it had just kind of\nbecame the de facto standard.\n\n36\n00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.380\nSo, most of the content that\nyou get from the Internet.\n\n37\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.550\nIf it's compressed we'll be using\na variation of the zip format, and\n\n38\n00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.760\nmacOS has support for zips built right in,\nwe can actually just jump right in there,\n\n39\n00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.390\nand you can open up zip files,\nor whatever.\n\n40\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.870\nAnd it works just fine.\n\n41\n00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.340\nIn fact, if I go to my Download folder,\n\n42\n00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.350\nI'm sure I downloaded at\nleast one zip file here.\n\n43\n00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.770\nSo, I've got this Mini-Config\nutility right here,\n\n44\n00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.350\nwhere I downloaded from a website and\nit downloaded as a zip.\n\n45\n00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.090\nI'm gonna just take that and\nmove that to my desktop here.\n\n46\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.080\nAll right, so on my desktop I see that\nmini config file and it shows up as a zip.\n\n47\n00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.640\nThe icon is showing as a zip.\n\n48\n00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.280\nThere's no quick look for\nthis or anything,\n\n49\n00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.060\nit just let's me know\nthat it is a zip archive.\n\n50\n00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.350\nAnd if I double click on that file,\n\n51\n00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.400\nI saw a quick little bar up here\nwith a line that went across it and\n\n52\n00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.480\nall a sudden I've got a folder with\nthe same name as that zip file.\n\n53\n00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.240\nAnd if I browse into that folder,\nthere's the file contents.\n\n54\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.510\nThere's the AJ mini config utility and\nthe PDF and some documentation.\n\n55\n00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.180\nThere's the format and\nthe files that I need.\n\n56\n00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.480\nSo, if somebody sends me a zip,\nI can open it right inside of macOS and\n\n57\n00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.690\nI don't need third party software at all.\n\n58\n00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.245\nIt's handled right here natively.\n&gt;&gt; How would we create our own\n\n59\n00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:28.100\nzip archive if we wanted to do that?\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so\n\n60\n00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.380\nin this case, I got a zip from\nsomebody else, it was already made.\n\n61\n00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.400\nSo, what did I do?\n\n62\n00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.900\nDouble-clicked, that's easy.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n63\n00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.080\n&gt;&gt; But what if I wanna send\n\n64\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.980\nsomething to somebody else?\n\n65\n00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.450\nSo, Zach, I wanna send him some e-books.\n\n66\n00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.030\nAnd so, in this folder over here,\nI've got three e-books.\n\n67\n00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.350\nAnd I wanna send these over to Zach.\n\n68\n00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.830\nWell, it's three different files.\n\n69\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.460\nAnd so, if I go into my email client,\n\n70\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.310\nI'll have to add it as three different\nattachments and send them along.\n\n71\n00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.936\nWouldn't it be nice to stick them all\n\n72\n00:03:52.936 --> 00:03:53.630\ntogether?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n73\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.370\n&gt;&gt; And individually, they are,\n\n74\n00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.830\nlet's see how big these things are.\n\n75\n00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.560\nWe've got 11 and a half megs, 15 and\na half megs, 9 and a half megs.\n\n76\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.675\nSo, we'll see how quick my math can be,\n17, 26 and a half megs.\n\n77\n00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:08.660\n26 and a half megs in size.\n\n78\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.980\nWell, if I can bundle them together and\ncompress them,\n\n79\n00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.700\nwhich a zip can do, it can make them\nsmaller and easier to transmit.\n\n80\n00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.290\nSo, if I highlight all three of those, so\n\n81\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.890\nI've highlighted the files that I want\nto compress, I can two finger tap,\n\n82\n00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.990\nor Ctrl-click, or whichever way you bring\nup the context menu on your Mac, and\n\n83\n00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.840\nyou'll see this option right here,\nCompress 3 items.\n\n84\n00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.450\nAnd when I choose Compress 3 items,\nit's going to build a zip for me.\n\n85\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.520\nAnd that zip file is going to contain each\n\n86\n00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.350\nof the files that were compressed,\nall right?\n\n87\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.510\nIt's gonna be stucked right\ninside of that archive,\n\n88\n00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.670\nthat zip now called the archive.zip,\nI might want to rename that to Ebooks.zip.\n\n89\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.680\nThere's that zip file, right?\n\n90\n00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.200\nNow, the reason I did that math\na moment ago is I wanted to highlight\n\n91\n00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.240\nsomething here.\n\n92\n00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.570\nThese PDF files are already compressed.\n\n93\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.970\nLike the Adobe format tries to\ncompress these things down, and\n\n94\n00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.020\nthere's images inside there.\n\n95\n00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.690\nThe image is already compressed.\n\n96\n00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.000\nWhen you try and compress something\nthat's already compressed\n\n97\n00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.430\nsometimes it gets bigger,\nand that's what happened.\n\n98\n00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.340\nIf I added up these three files,\nit added up to, what did I say?\n\n99\n00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.510\nActually, you know what, no.\n\n100\n00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.706\nI did bad math a minute ago.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:22.716\n&gt;&gt; I said 26 and a half,\n\n102\n00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:24.631\nit's actually 36 and a half megabytes,\n\n103\n00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:26.655\nis what it was.\n&gt;&gt; I know that's what you meant.\n\n104\n00:05:26.655 --> 00:05:27.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now,\n\n105\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.870\nit's down to 32.7,\nit actually got smaller.\n\n106\n00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.280\nSo, I guess, the PDFs weren't compressed.\n\n107\n00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.380\nSo, it got smaller.\n\n108\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.006\nMy math skills also got smaller.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n109\n00:05:36.006 --> 00:05:38.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, it did get smaller, and\n\n110\n00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.780\nnow it is all combined.\n\n111\n00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.240\nBut what I was saying is absolutely true.\n\n112\n00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.630\nIf you have JPEGs.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n113\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.260\n&gt;&gt; JPEG image files,\n\n114\n00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.550\nthey're already compressed.\n\n115\n00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.520\nAnd they will often times get bigger.\n\n116\n00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.550\nMP4 files, AVI files, most video files.\n\n117\n00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.765\nIf you compress them,\nthey'll actually get bigger.\n\n118\n00:05:55.765 --> 00:05:59.111\nCuz they're already as compressed as\nthey can get without losing data.\n\n119\n00:05:59.111 --> 00:06:03.660\nSo, it's not always a great\nidea to try and compress down.\n\n120\n00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.350\nBut once they're put together like this,\nI can send Zach just this one file.\n\n121\n00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.980\nHe gets it,\nall he has to do is double click on it.\n\n122\n00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.850\nAnd then, he'll have these three books\nthat he can go in, open up, start reading,\n\n123\n00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.430\nand have a great time.\n\n124\n00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.260\nSo, super easy to come in and\n\n125\n00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.050\ncreate that archive ourselves.\n&gt;&gt; Now, are there archive\n\n126\n00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.830\ntypes we should be aware of?\n&gt;&gt; There are, absolutely.\n\n127\n00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.160\nAnd I mentioned if we have compressed\ndata, we don't necessarily want to\n\n128\n00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.450\ncompress it again,\nthat can be a problem with ZIP format.\n\n129\n00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.693\nIf I do it here inside of macOS,\nit's automatically going to compress.\n\n130\n00:06:36.693 --> 00:06:38.650\nIf I use third-party software,\nI can disable that.\n\n131\n00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.230\nI could say, put it in zip,\nbut don't compress.\n\n132\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.920\nAnd that can help, right?\n\n133\n00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.030\nBut inside of macOS, there's actually\nanother type of archive format that's\n\n134\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.800\nreally popular that\ndoesn't do compression.\n\n135\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.210\nAnd that's called a disk image,\nor a DMG, right?\n\n136\n00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.900\nWhen you download software for\n\n137\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.540\na Mac, nine times out of ten it's not\ngonna be a zip, it's going to be a DMG.\n\n138\n00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.170\nI've got one here on my desktop for\nViscosity.\n\n139\n00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.930\nViscosity is a VPN client that I use.\n\n140\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.534\nAnd if you go to their website and\ndownload it, you'll download a dmg file.\n\n141\n00:07:10.534 --> 00:07:13.544\nThat AJA Mini-Config that\nI downloaded was a zip,\n\n142\n00:07:13.544 --> 00:07:16.350\ndid you notice the files\nwhen I extracted them?\n\n143\n00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.110\nWhere is that, here.\n\n144\n00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.991\nWhen I extracted them,\nwhat was inside of it?\n\n145\n00:07:19.991 --> 00:07:22.571\nThe PDF help documentation, and\n\n146\n00:07:22.571 --> 00:07:24.967\nAJA_MiniConfig.dmg.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n147\n00:07:24.967 --> 00:07:26.969\n&gt;&gt; The put a dmg inside of the zip,\n\n148\n00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:28.740\nwhich is super redundant.\n\n149\n00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.690\nThey could have easily put\nthese other files in the dmg.\n\n150\n00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.690\nThere's a reason why they didn't,\nI'll show you in a moment.\n\n151\n00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.457\nBut those dmg files those are disc images.\n\n152\n00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:42.245\nAnd it's not a compressed archive,\nlike a ZIP would be, it's an archive\n\n153\n00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:47.050\nthat's supposed to be a mirror of\na disc that was created somewhere else.\n\n154\n00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.200\nAnd the way that is used to be used was,\nif I was a software vendor and\n\n155\n00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.500\nI was selling CDs, or DVDs, I could\ncreate a disk image of that DVD and\n\n156\n00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.201\nthat disk image will be a dmg file, and\nI can distribute that out to people.\n\n157\n00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:02.920\nAnd they would see it as a DMG.\n\n158\n00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:09.440\nAnd if they double-click on it,\nit will pop up and do something.\n\n159\n00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.080\nNow, this one pops up and\nstarts to install software.\n\n160\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.210\nBut other ones will actually pop up and\nshow me the contents that are inside it.\n\n161\n00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.190\nThey have the ability to do other things,\n\n162\n00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.520\nunlike a zip where it just\nextracts it on the disk.\n\n163\n00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.710\nHere, we can do more.\n\n164\n00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:28.823\nSo the DMG format is actually really built\naround this idea of distributing software.\n\n165\n00:08:28.823 --> 00:08:30.979\nBut you can put anything in a DMG.\n\n166\n00:08:30.979 --> 00:08:33.767\nAnd it is a common format that\nyou are going to encounter.\n\n167\n00:08:33.767 --> 00:08:37.990\nAre they opened the same way as zip files?\n&gt;&gt; So they're different, right?\n\n168\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.300\nI mean, we double-click, right?\n\n169\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.530\nThat's what I just did,\nand we double-click a zip.\n\n170\n00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:47.370\nBut where it's different is with a zip,\nthe system knows it's just an archive,\n\n171\n00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.030\nand it just takes the files out of it,\nand that's the end of it, right?\n\n172\n00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.300\nBut with a DMG,\nthe system doesn't really know what it is.\n\n173\n00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.340\nIt knows that it's a disk image, but\nit doesn't know what's on the disk.\n\n174\n00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.520\nAnd so,\nwhat will happen with a lot of them, and\n\n175\n00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.950\nlet me just cancel this,\nand get out of this one.\n\n176\n00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.908\nWhat happens with a lot of them is that\nwhen you double-click on them it treats it\n\n177\n00:09:06.908 --> 00:09:08.095\nlike a hard drive.\n\n178\n00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:12.892\nSo if I take that viscosity file,\nand I'll double-click on it,\n\n179\n00:09:12.892 --> 00:09:17.090\nwhen I double-click on it,\na little bar goes across.\n\n180\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.610\nWhich might make you think, hey, it's\nextracting the files, where's it going?\n\n181\n00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.780\nBut then, it opens up a folder.\n\n182\n00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.290\nAnd you might notice up here, all of\na sudden I have a second hard drive.\n\n183\n00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.350\nI had Macintosh HD.\n\n184\n00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.280\nNow, I've got a hard\ndrive called Viscosity.\n\n185\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.490\nWhat the heck is that?\n\n186\n00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.170\nWell, it's not a real hard drive.\n\n187\n00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.510\nIt's a virtual hard drive.\n\n188\n00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.420\nThat's a virtual disk.\n\n189\n00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.640\nRemember, the DMG file is a disk image.\n\n190\n00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.860\nSo now, it's pretending, hey,\nyou got a real disk, it's right here.\n\n191\n00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.970\nAnd when we open that disk,\nyou see a folder.\n\n192\n00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:52.570\nAnd for software installation,\nthey can make that folder look pretty and\n\n193\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:58.280\nhave the two most important things, the\napplication in the Applications folder.\n\n194\n00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.331\nIf I want to install Viscosity,\n\n195\n00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:06.417\nall I have to do is drag the application,\nand drop it.\n\n196\n00:10:06.417 --> 00:10:07.919\nApparently dragging is\ngoing to be my challenge.\n\n197\n00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:11.921\nThere we go, drag it and\ndrop it on the Applications folder,\n\n198\n00:10:11.921 --> 00:10:14.124\nand it's going to be installed.\n\n199\n00:10:14.124 --> 00:10:17.390\nNow, I already have it installed on mine,\nbut I could replace it if I wanted.\n\n200\n00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.710\nActually, I've got it running right now,\nso I need to leave it be.\n\n201\n00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.160\nBut it'll copy over here, and\nonce it's in, it's around here somewhere,\n\n202\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.800\nthere it is, Viscosity.\n\n203\n00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.110\nIt's installed, and\nnow I have that application.\n\n204\n00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.770\nThat's why this is so easy for\napplication installations.\n\n205\n00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.120\nI'm just dragging it and dropping it.\n\n206\n00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.470\nNow, because they tried to keep it easy,\n\n207\n00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.980\nthey made that folder where\nit just had these two items.\n\n208\n00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.250\nAnd that's why, with the AJA software, why\nthey didn't want to put it all in the DMG.\n\n209\n00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.990\nThey wanted to have\nthe help documentation and\n\n210\n00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:55.130\nother things right there, and\nthat would make this more complex, right?\n\n211\n00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.860\nSo they distributed it as two pieces\nwhich, in my opinion, is also complex, but\n\n212\n00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.060\nthat's what they chose.\n\n213\n00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.510\nViscosity, on the other hand, just said,\nhey look, anybody can drag and drop,\n\n214\n00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.770\nthat's all it takes.\n\n215\n00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:05.890\nOnce they're in the program,\n\n216\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.170\nthey can pull up the help documentation\nstuff from inside the program.\n\n217\n00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.110\nEasy enough, right?\n\n218\n00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.660\nSo that's the approach that\ndifferent vendors take.\n\n219\n00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:18.000\nBut these DMG files,\nthey are effectively fake hard drives.\n\n220\n00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000\nAnd that's exactly how the finder\nsees them, when you fire one of these\n\n221\n00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.140\nthings up, they show up on your desk and\nthey are virtual hard drives.\n\n222\n00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.540\nAnd your finder, like my finder\nright now is hiding it from me.\n\n223\n00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.240\nBut if I click here I should see it.\n\n224\n00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.230\nYeah, there, it shows up as a disk\nlike my regular hard drive,\n\n225\n00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.330\nnetwork remote disc, there's Viscosity.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n226\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.990\nI can eject it just like any other disc.\n\n227\n00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.934\nI can take it and just drag it and\ndrop it down onto my Trash.\n\n228\n00:11:46.934 --> 00:11:48.983\nAnd my head's gonna cover it up, but\n\n229\n00:11:48.983 --> 00:11:53.090\nthe trash changes from a Trash bin\nto a little Eject button, right?\n\n230\n00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.000\nSo it's like I'm ejecting a disc.\n\n231\n00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.670\nAnd when I do that, that unmounts the DMG,\nand it goes away, right?\n\n232\n00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.430\nNow I keep saying mount and\n\n233\n00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.780\nunmount, that's Unix terminology.\n&gt;&gt; In the Unix world,\n\n234\n00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:10.440\nwhen you wanna connect to a file system,\nyou gonna mount and unmount it.\n\n235\n00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.100\nWith these, when we open them up,\nthat's all happening automatically for us.\n\n236\n00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.990\nAnd we don't really see\nit here in the GUI, but\n\n237\n00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.690\nyou do see it in the disk utility.\n\n238\n00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:24.020\nSo, for example, let me open up\nthat Viscosity DMG one more time.\n\n239\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.490\nSo I'm gonna click on it, that\nvirtual hard drive appears right here.\n\n240\n00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:32.690\nAnd if I go into my disk utility,\ninside of disk utility,\n\n241\n00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.830\nI see my internal disk, this Macintosh HD.\n\n242\n00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.210\nAnd then, I see under Disk Images,\nthere's Viscosity.\n\n243\n00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:44.191\nIt shows as a Disk Image that's running\nthe Mac OS Extended file system,\n\n244\n00:12:44.191 --> 00:12:47.550\nand it's got 40.3 megs\nof data inside of it.\n\n245\n00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.920\nHere's the virtual disk, and\nI can inject it right from here,\n\n246\n00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.900\njust like it was a USB key, or\na time machine drive, or whatever.\n\n247\n00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.340\nI can eject it, and now it's gone and\nunavailable unless I mount it again.\n\n248\n00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.897\nSo the whole mount and\nunmount terminology,\n\n249\n00:13:02.897 --> 00:13:05.810\nwe see that in the disk utility.\n\n250\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.170\nIt's hidden from us in\nthe rest of the GUI.\n\n251\n00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, is it difficult to\n\n252\n00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.130\ncreate a disk image file?\n&gt;&gt; It depends on how much you wanna do\n\n253\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:13.690\nwith it, right?\n\n254\n00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.810\nSo if you just wanna create a disk image\nfile and put a couple of files in it,\n\n255\n00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.250\nthat's actually pretty easy.\n\n256\n00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.710\nIf you wanted to look slick,\nlike the Viscosity one, right?\n\n257\n00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.780\nSo when I open that Viscosity one-\n&gt;&gt; I want\n\n258\n00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.710\nit to look slick.\n&gt;&gt; It looks slick.\n\n259\n00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.150\nThat's actually hard to do.\n\n260\n00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.310\nBecause you have to create what's\neffectively like an HTML page that\n\n261\n00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.227\nis being rendered.\n\n262\n00:13:32.227 --> 00:13:35.320\nCuz, see this gradient\n\n263\n00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.306\nthat's in the background?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n264\n00:13:36.306 --> 00:13:37.040\n&gt;&gt; Like a dark grey?\n\n265\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.220\nAnd the arrow that's displayed in\nthe text that's displayed here?\n\n266\n00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.900\nWhere does that come from?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n267\n00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, you have to have configuration\n\n268\n00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.350\nfiles inside of that.\n\n269\n00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:50.390\nAnd you don't see a lot of\nthat when you're in the GUI.\n\n270\n00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.960\nIf we go into our terminal,\nyou can see some of it.\n\n271\n00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.870\nAnd these guys,\nsome of them get really fancy with these\n\n272\n00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.560\nthings.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do.\n\n273\n00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.770\n&gt;&gt; But if I browse into it, and\n\n274\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.240\nnotice how I'm browsing into it here\nin the terminal just inside of /volumes\n\n275\n00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.480\nlike any other mounted disk.\n\n276\n00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.880\nI see Macintosh HD is right there.\n\n277\n00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.490\nAnd I browse into Viscosity.\n\n278\n00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.990\nWhen I look there I see Viscosity.app,\nand I see the Applications folder,\n\n279\n00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.730\nwhich is actually a link, right?\n\n280\n00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.230\nThose are the two files that are in there.\n\n281\n00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:21.420\nBut if I do an ls -la,\nthat tells it to show me hidden stuff.\n\n282\n00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.520\nAnd in the hidden stuff,\nI can see a file in there, I mean,\n\n283\n00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.962\na folder, called .background.\n\n284\n00:14:27.962 --> 00:14:30.745\nAnd that .background,\n\n285\n00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:34.805\nthat's where they're hiding all of\nthe stuff that's being rendered.\n\n286\n00:14:34.805 --> 00:14:36.595\nAnd so, here's this background TIFF, and\n\n287\n00:14:36.595 --> 00:14:39.745\nthat's the gradient that's displayed.\n&gt;&gt; And in that image,\n\n288\n00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:42.117\nit's got the text with the arrow and\nall that.\n\n289\n00:14:42.117 --> 00:14:44.461\nSo that takes a little bit of work, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n290\n00:14:44.461 --> 00:14:46.143\n&gt;&gt; But if you just wanna create a DMG\n\n291\n00:14:46.143 --> 00:14:48.455\nwith some files in it, it's not that hard.\n\n292\n00:14:48.455 --> 00:14:50.795\nBut it's not very intuitive either,\n\n293\n00:14:50.795 --> 00:14:54.830\nbecause Apple expects\ndevelopers to create these.\n\n294\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.250\nRegular users, Apple expects\nto just use a zip file, okay?\n\n295\n00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.970\nSo if we wanna make one, they're actually\nmade from inside of the disk utility.\n\n296\n00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.542\nSo let me go back into my disk utility.\n\n297\n00:15:05.493 --> 00:15:08.455\nAnd when you're in the disk utility,\n\n298\n00:15:08.455 --> 00:15:13.850\nyou're not gonna see much here\nthat references these images.\n\n299\n00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.110\nBut if you go up top to your menus, you'll\nsee there's an Images menu where you can\n\n300\n00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:22.130\nverify an image, you can add a check sum,\nconvert an image, resize an image.\n\n301\n00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.190\nYou can do stuff like that.\n\n302\n00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.220\nBut there's not create an image.\n\n303\n00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.500\nThat's under File.\n\n304\n00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.490\nAnd under File, you'll see New Disk Image.\n\n305\n00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:36.150\nAnd I can create a new disk image that's\nblank, or I can create one from a folder.\n\n306\n00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:41.360\nSo on my desktop, I've got this eBooks\nfolder, and I can come in here.\n\n307\n00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.610\nLet me get rid of that zip file that\nwas in there, we don't need that.\n\n308\n00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.175\nAnd so, let's say I've built this folder,\nand I'll do the .background and\n\n309\n00:15:48.175 --> 00:15:51.699\nall those other things, and kinda get it\nset up the perfect way that I want it.\n\n310\n00:15:51.699 --> 00:15:56.071\nAnd then, we just come into Disk Utility,\nand go up here to File,\n\n311\n00:15:56.071 --> 00:15:57.354\nwe go to New Image.\n\n312\n00:15:57.354 --> 00:16:02.615\nChoose Image from folder, and\nthen we're gonna tell what folder we want.\n\n313\n00:16:02.615 --> 00:16:07.574\nSo I'm gonna go to my desktop,\nI'm gonna pick that eBooks folder,\n\n314\n00:16:07.574 --> 00:16:09.240\nand I'll hit choose.\n\n315\n00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.850\nAnd once I choose it, it's gonna create,\nit's gonna ask where I wanna save it.\n\n316\n00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.990\nI'm gonna call it eBooks,\nI'll save it on my desktop, that's fine.\n\n317\n00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.520\nAnd then I get two options here.\n\n318\n00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.490\nOne, do I want encryption or not?\n\n319\n00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:25.800\nYou can encrypt the disc image, and if you\ndo that, you have to assign a password.\n\n320\n00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.800\nAnd in order for somebody to mount it,\nthey would have to provide it.\n\n321\n00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.000\nSo if this was sensitive data,\na great way to encrypt it.\n\n322\n00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.610\nNext, whether I want it to be compressed.\n\n323\n00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.850\nAnd here, you've got a couple of\ninteresting options aside from that.\n\n324\n00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.550\nIf I choose compressed, it's really\nnot much different than a zip file.\n\n325\n00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.960\nIt's going to try to shrink\nit as much as it can.\n\n326\n00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.200\nBut I could do a read-only file.\n\n327\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.780\nIn other words,\nonce this disk image is created,\n\n328\n00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.070\nyou can't add anything else to it.\n\n329\n00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.917\nWhat's in it in the beginning is it,\nand that's the end of it.\n\n330\n00:16:53.917 --> 00:16:57.241\nI could let it be read-write,\nsomebody else could open it,\n\n331\n00:16:57.241 --> 00:17:00.230\nthey could add data to\nit if they wanted to.\n\n332\n00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.730\nWe usually don't want that.\n\n333\n00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:02.790\nI could do it as a DVD or\n\n334\n00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.290\na CD master, like this is eventually\ngonna be burned to a DVD.\n\n335\n00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.610\nOr a hybrid image,\nthose you don't see so much anymore.\n\n336\n00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:13.990\nBut that was when they were doing the,\nwhere you have like a music CD, and\n\n337\n00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.990\nyou could pop into a computer, and\nthere were programs on it as well.\n\n338\n00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.250\nSo we could do a hybrid.\n\n339\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.670\nSo you have a couple of variations there.\n\n340\n00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.520\nI'm just gonna leave it at compressed,\nand hit Save.\n\n341\n00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:28.210\nAnd now it's gonna build that\nDMG based off of my eBooks.\n\n342\n00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.830\nAnd so it's building it right now,\ndon't get a whole lot of details on that.\n\n343\n00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:35.480\nBut once it's done,\nI can look on the desktop, and\n\n344\n00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.120\nhere's the eBooks dmg file that it made.\n\n345\n00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.390\nAnd I chose compressed,\nso if I look at its size,\n\n346\n00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:48.100\n33 MB in size, the data did get smaller\nfrom the 36.5 that I had before.\n\n347\n00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.430\nAnd if I double-click on it,\nit's gonna mount it.\n\n348\n00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.840\nAnd once it's done mounting, I've got\nanother virtual hard drive showing up over\n\n349\n00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.670\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n350\n00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.689\n&gt;&gt; And it's got the eBooks inside.\n\n351\n00:17:59.689 --> 00:18:00.890\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that something?\n\n352\n00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.180\n&gt;&gt; So that's pretty easy, but\n\n353\n00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.880\nit certainly be more complex.\n\n354\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.430\nI built it from a folder,\nso that was easy, but\n\n355\n00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.310\nif I didn't build it from a folder,\nyou get a lot of other choices.\n\n356\n00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:13.600\nAnd I just wanna highlight one of these\nbecause it can turn up on the exam.\n\n357\n00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.240\nIn Disk Utility, if you go up to the File,\nand New Image, and\n\n358\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.050\nlet's just say you create a Blank Image,\nnot from a folder.\n\n359\n00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:25.530\nWell, it asks a lot more questions.\n\n360\n00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.930\nSo I have to give it a name,\nI'm gonna call mine eBooks2.\n\n361\n00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.820\nSo I'm gonna put my eBooks\nin here eventually.\n\n362\n00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:31.670\nWhere does it want it to go?\n\n363\n00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:32.950\nDesktop, that's fine.\n\n364\n00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.260\nThen, what's the name of it?\n\n365\n00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:40.660\nThe name of the virtual drive doesn't have\nto match the name of the file itself.\n\n366\n00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:49.010\nSo for example,\nmy file might be called dons-ebooks-v12.1,\n\n367\n00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:53.840\nthat might be what I wanted\nto be called dot dmg.\n\n368\n00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.495\nBut then when somebody mounts it, I just\nwant the virtual drive to show up as\n\n369\n00:18:57.495 --> 00:19:02.130\nDpn's eBooks like that, and that's what\nthe virtual driver will show up as.\n\n370\n00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.945\nAnd then how big do I want it?\n\n371\n00:19:03.945 --> 00:19:08.500\nRemember, this is a disk image,\nso it's basically a fake disk.\n\n372\n00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.000\nDo I want it to be a hundred megs or\na gig or a terabyte?\n\n373\n00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.490\nNow if it was a zip file,\nwe don't specify size.\n\n374\n00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.121\nIt's just big as it needs\nto be to hold the files.\n\n375\n00:19:17.121 --> 00:19:20.630\nBut this is a disk, and\nI have to tell it the size.\n\n376\n00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.710\nNow here's where it gets tricky.\n\n377\n00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.680\nBy default the file I create\nwill actually be the size.\n\n378\n00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.980\nSo if I say it's 100 megs, and then I\njust put 36 megs of eBooks in there,\n\n379\n00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.780\nthe DMG file is still 100 megs.\n\n380\n00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.750\nSo if I say it's going to be a terabyte,\n\n381\n00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.120\nthe DMG file it's about to make\nwould be a terabyte in size.\n\n382\n00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.930\nAnd so you don't wanna go any\nlarger than you absolutely have to.\n\n383\n00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.860\nBut I'll show you in a second, there's\nactually a way to work around that.\n\n384\n00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.570\nI'm gonna leave mine in 100 megabytes for\nright now.\n\n385\n00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:56.920\nThen the format, remember, it's a fake\ndisc, and fake discs can get formatted.\n\n386\n00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.350\nAnd so when you drop that down,\nyou'll see different formats.\n\n387\n00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.000\nNow there's some Microsoft\nformats down here, but\n\n388\n00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.200\nthey're fairly pointless because Microsoft\ndoesn't support the DMG format, so\n\n389\n00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.210\nthere's really not a whole\nlot of reason to use those.\n\n390\n00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.450\nIt also has APFS support, but\n\n391\n00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:16.900\nright now I would encourage you to\nstick with Mac OS Extended Journaled.\n\n392\n00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:22.050\nAnd the reason is APFS support was\njust introduced in macOS High Sierra.\n\n393\n00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.530\nSo if you make a DMG that's\nformatted with APFS,\n\n394\n00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.270\nonly High Sierra systems\nwill be able to open it.\n\n395\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.850\nSo you're effectively cutting\noff all of the older machines.\n\n396\n00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.090\nIf you're distributing software,\nthat's not ideal.\n\n397\n00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:37.850\nSo Mac OS Extended Journaled, that would\ngo like all the way back to, I think\n\n398\n00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.980\nit would actually go all the way back\nto 10.1, like even non supported ones.\n\n399\n00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.690\nIt'll go back a long, long way.\n\n400\n00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.200\nSo that's usually what\nwe want on this one.\n\n401\n00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.028\nThen if I want encryption,\nwe saw that earlier.\n\n402\n00:20:49.028 --> 00:20:54.210\nPartitions, if it's a real disk,\nI can divide it into partitions.\n\n403\n00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.330\nWith a virtual disk like that, there's not\nreally a whole lot of point for it, but\n\n404\n00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:58.500\nif you want, you can go crazy.\n\n405\n00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.980\nIt will let you do it and, yeah,\nyou can have fun with that.\n\n406\n00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.180\nAgain, most of the time we're\njust gonna stick with one,\n\n407\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.120\nbut this last one is the important\none I wanna show you.\n\n408\n00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.340\nIt's gonna create a read,\nwrite, disk image,\n\n409\n00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.220\nby default, cuz a disk would\nnormally be read and write.\n\n410\n00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.685\nBut if I expand that out, I see something\nvery different than what we saw before.\n\n411\n00:21:17.685 --> 00:21:23.310\nDVD/CD Master, I guess we saw that one,\nbut I'm not seeing some of the other ones,\n\n412\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.300\nlike the hybrid system, or\nread-only, or compressed.\n\n413\n00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:31.100\nThose go away, and they've been\nreplaced by sparse disk image and\n\n414\n00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.390\nsparse bundle disk image.\n\n415\n00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.860\nWhat are those?\n\n416\n00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:41.388\nA sparse disk image says even though\nyou said the size was a 100 MB,\n\n417\n00:21:41.388 --> 00:21:47.020\nif you put 20 MB in there,\nthe file will only be 20 megs in size.\n\n418\n00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.840\nBy doing this sparse image,\n\n419\n00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:53.720\nyou're saying that it won't take up\nany more space than is necessary.\n\n420\n00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.460\nEmpty space won't actually\nconsume actual space.\n\n421\n00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.740\nSo we normally want a sparse disk image.\n\n422\n00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:04.420\nVery very few people are doing a full one.\n\n423\n00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.120\nThere is reasons for it, but for\nmost of us, it's not gonna be useful.\n\n424\n00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.170\nSo that's particularly what we want.\n\n425\n00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.280\nThe difference between sparse bundle disk\nimages and sparse disk image, originally\n\n426\n00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.590\nApple envisioned the sparse disk image\nwas used for actual disk storage, and\n\n427\n00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:22.210\nthe sparse bundle disk image was used for\ndistributing software.\n\n428\n00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:26.590\nApplications are bundles, and so we're\nbundling those together and moving along.\n\n429\n00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:31.730\nIn today's world, very, very few\npeople are using them as actual disks.\n\n430\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.970\nWith the actual disks,\nthis is where read write comes in handy.\n\n431\n00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:41.460\nIf you have it where you're writing into\none of these DMGs, every time it grows,\n\n432\n00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.320\nthe next spot on the physical disk might\nalready be full with somebody else's data,\n\n433\n00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.890\nor some other program's data.\n\n434\n00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.130\nSo it might have to break the file\nup on the hard drive to fit it.\n\n435\n00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.210\nThat creates fragmentation,\nthat hurts performance.\n\n436\n00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:55.780\nNow if it's just an archive,\nwe don't care about performance.\n\n437\n00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:59.350\nBut if I'm actually using this disk\nto store a database or a file,\n\n438\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.250\nlike a FileMaker Pro database, or\n\n439\n00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.730\nsomething like that,\nit will make that database run slow.\n\n440\n00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.340\nIf I choose to keep it all together,\n\n441\n00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.690\nit makes one big file right\nnow that never grows.\n\n442\n00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:13.570\nAnd it gets all the space, all in order,\nfragmentation's not a problem.\n\n443\n00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.590\nYou get great performance out of it.\n\n444\n00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.610\nBut that's really an old way\nof using this thing, and\n\n445\n00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.580\nvery very few people do that today.\n\n446\n00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.995\nSo for most of us, we'll just go\nwith a sparse bundle disc image.\n\n447\n00:23:23.995 --> 00:23:27.490\nAnd the moment I do that, see how it\nchanged my file extension up there to be\n\n448\n00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.320\nsparsebundle?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n449\n00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.390\n&gt;&gt; You can leave it that way, but\n\n450\n00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:37.480\nalmost every person on the planet just\ntakes that and says, you know what,\n\n451\n00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.420\nI'm just gonna rename that dmg because\npeople don't know what sparse bundles are,\n\n452\n00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.800\nand that's what they do.\n\n453\n00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.620\nAnd so when I ran that viscosity DMG,\nwell, that was a sparse bundle.\n\n454\n00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.350\nIt was the exact size of\nthe data inside of it,\n\n455\n00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:55.000\nbut they just renamed it dmg\ncuz they're all disk images.\n\n456\n00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.500\nAnd it's shorter, right?\n\n457\n00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.487\nThe sparse bundle's kinda long.\n\n458\n00:23:57.487 --> 00:23:59.555\nSo we can set that, and we can save it.\n\n459\n00:23:59.555 --> 00:24:04.592\nAnd now instead of creating a file\nthat's 100 MB, When I save that,\n\n460\n00:24:04.592 --> 00:24:08.625\nit's gonna warn me,\nit's warning me about the extension.\n\n461\n00:24:08.625 --> 00:24:10.315\nI'll go ahead and\nlet it use the sparse bundle,\n\n462\n00:24:10.315 --> 00:24:12.330\nwe can just rename it after it's made.\n\n463\n00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:19.626\nOnce it's made, we'll find, way down here,\ndons-ebooks-v12.1-sparsebundle.\n\n464\n00:24:19.626 --> 00:24:22.360\nNow we can rename it, and\nit'll be happy again.\n\n465\n00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.628\nSo I'll just rename that.\n\n466\n00:24:24.628 --> 00:24:28.570\nAnd once I do,\nit still shows up as a disk image.\n\n467\n00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.786\nAnd I can double-click on it and\nit's gonna mount it.\n\n468\n00:24:31.786 --> 00:24:38.440\nAnd so I can see the file was\ncalled don's-ebooks-v12.1.dmg.\n\n469\n00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.073\nUp here, I can see that it's\njust called Don's eBooks.\n\n470\n00:24:42.073 --> 00:24:43.986\nYou remember I gave it the alternate name.\n\n471\n00:24:43.986 --> 00:24:48.182\nAnd if I look at the file data on that,\n\n472\n00:24:50.791 --> 00:24:54.670\nHang on, let me get that,\nI'll do a little command i here.\n\n473\n00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.515\nThe file right now is 20 megabyte.\n\n474\n00:24:57.515 --> 00:25:01.450\nNow it's empty, and I said it wasn't\ngonna make empty space take up space.\n\n475\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.066\nWell, there's a minimum.\n\n476\n00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:05.340\nThe minimum is 20 megabytes.\n\n477\n00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.024\nIt has to have some overhead\njust to store the file system.\n\n478\n00:25:08.024 --> 00:25:10.485\nIt's formatted macOS Extended Journaled.\n\n479\n00:25:10.485 --> 00:25:14.554\nmacOS Extended Journaled needs at least\n20 megabytes to store its file table.\n\n480\n00:25:14.554 --> 00:25:16.590\nSo it's gonna be at least that size.\n\n481\n00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:19.738\nBut once I start chucking some data into\nit, we'll see some interesting things.\n\n482\n00:25:19.738 --> 00:25:26.290\nSo if I take Don's eBooks and open it up,\nand then I take my PDFs that I had.\n\n483\n00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:31.405\nAnd we'll just drag those in there and\nthrow them in.\n\n484\n00:25:31.405 --> 00:25:33.760\nOops, I only grabbed one,\nlet me try that again.\n\n485\n00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.338\nI'll grab a few more.\n\n486\n00:25:36.338 --> 00:25:38.835\nI'm having the hardest time with drag and\ndrop today,\n\n487\n00:25:38.835 --> 00:25:39.788\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n488\n00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:42.177\n&gt;&gt; That concept is apparently beyond me.\n\n489\n00:25:42.177 --> 00:25:45.910\nAnd then I'm gonna paste\nit in the wrong place.\n\n490\n00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.376\nThere we go, so we can paste those in.\n\n491\n00:25:49.376 --> 00:25:54.119\nAs I do that, the disk image is\neffectively growing to encompass these,\n\n492\n00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:56.940\nnow I'm more than 20 megabytes in size.\n\n493\n00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.470\nIt's growing and adding onto it.\n\n494\n00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:03.031\nAnd now I can take that and\ndistribute it out to people as a disk.\n\n495\n00:26:03.031 --> 00:26:04.767\nI'll need to eject it when I'm done,\n\n496\n00:26:04.767 --> 00:26:08.280\nwhich I'm actually creating\na really big mess here, whoops.\n\n497\n00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:12.310\nSo I'll take these and\nwe can just eject them.\n\n498\n00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:16.098\nAnd when we do that,\nthat data is now in the dmg.\n\n499\n00:26:16.098 --> 00:26:18.436\nI can go and distribute that out,\nand off we go.\n\n500\n00:26:18.436 --> 00:26:21.177\nIt's far easier to make\nthe dmg from the folder.\n\n501\n00:26:21.177 --> 00:26:25.616\nBut the reason I wanted to show you that\nwas because, if you create an empty one,\n\n502\n00:26:25.616 --> 00:26:29.923\nand you pick that file size and you don't\ntell it you wanna do a sparse bundle,\n\n503\n00:26:29.923 --> 00:26:32.657\nthe file will be as big as\nthe size you designate.\n\n504\n00:26:32.657 --> 00:26:34.142\nSo definitely something\nto keep an eye out for.\n\n505\n00:26:34.142 --> 00:26:36.408\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic episode as usual, Don.\n\n506\n00:26:36.408 --> 00:26:37.383\nWell done, sir.\n\n507\n00:26:37.383 --> 00:26:41.798\nArchives and images, and\nI know you have something else you'd\n\n508\n00:26:41.798 --> 00:26:44.420\nlike to say.\n&gt;&gt; Key thing here, I kind of already\n\n509\n00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.864\nmentioned my main caveat, which is,\nyou'll probably wanna stick with\n\n510\n00:26:47.864 --> 00:26:51.486\nthe macOS extended file system just to\nget the most compatibility out of it.\n\n511\n00:26:51.486 --> 00:26:55.420\nThe other thing is DMGs\ncan be far more advanced.\n\n512\n00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:59.423\nThe AJA one that I opened up a moment ago,\nit auto launched the installer.\n\n513\n00:26:59.423 --> 00:27:00.940\nNot many developers do that.\n\n514\n00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.400\nBut you can, it does have that capability.\n\n515\n00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.474\nAnd that's just, again,\n\n516\n00:27:04.474 --> 00:27:07.570\nmore extended functionality that's\ntucked away in the background of those.\n\n517\n00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.683\nSo if you go to the Apple developer\nwebsite they have all that documented.\n\n518\n00:27:09.683 --> 00:27:10.830\nI don't know how to do it.\n\n519\n00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.781\nIf you're just trying to distribute files\nthough, you've seen how to do that.\n\n520\n00:27:13.781 --> 00:27:14.979\nYou can chuck them in there.\n\n521\n00:27:14.979 --> 00:27:17.180\nI'll be honest with you,\nI normally just do zips.\n\n522\n00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.866\nAnd throw them in there.\n\n523\n00:27:18.866 --> 00:27:23.524\nIf you have other archive formats,\nlike RARs,\n\n524\n00:27:23.524 --> 00:27:27.371\n7Zip, things like that, GZip even.\n\n525\n00:27:27.371 --> 00:27:30.200\nmacOS doesn't have data support for those.\n\n526\n00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.283\nAnd there's always third\nparty applications,\n\n527\n00:27:32.283 --> 00:27:34.833\nlike the Entropy application that I use or\nother programs.\n\n528\n00:27:34.833 --> 00:27:37.225\nAnd you can use them to\nmanage the archives as well.\n\n529\n00:27:37.225 --> 00:27:39.155\n&gt;&gt; Apple certified support professionals,\n\n530\n00:27:39.155 --> 00:27:40.124\na fantastic series.\n\n531\n00:27:40.124 --> 00:27:42.455\nMake sure you watch all the episodes.\n\n532\n00:27:42.455 --> 00:27:46.077\nDon's worked very hard and done such a\ngreat job putting those together for you.\n\n533\n00:27:46.077 --> 00:27:48.550\nAnd you're gonna be in\nthe course library too.\n\n534\n00:27:48.550 -->

be\ntalking about Time Machine which is\n\n18\n00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:46.490\nthe backup solution provided\nby Apple as part of macOS.\n\n19\n00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.981\nAnd I’ll go on record as saying this, that\nTime Machine is probably one of the most\n\n20\n00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:56.929\nreliable and easy to use backup\nsolutions found on any operating system.\n\n21\n00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.520\nI mean, Apple nailed it with this,\nit is so easy to back up and\n\n22\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.600\nrestore your data, if we do it, right?\n\n23\n00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.670\nThat's kinda the key secret here, is that\nTime Machine is not enabled by default.\n\n24\n00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.680\nIt's not running and backing your stuff\nup, you have to know to turn it on.\n\n25\n00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.960\nAnd so in this episode we're gonna\ntalk about what's involved with that,\n\n26\n00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.300\nhow we get it turned on,\nthe considerations we have.\n\n27\n00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.824\nAnd the consideration we have beyond just\na home user, but what a business needs to\n\n28\n00:01:20.824 --> 00:01:23.700\nbe thinking about with Time Machine and\nhow that data is backed up.\n\n29\n00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.566\nAnd how we can make sure that\nif we ever get into trouble and\n\n30\n00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.554\nwe're missing our data,\nthat we'll be able to recover and\n\n31\n00:01:29.554 --> 00:01:32.560\nget right back to where we need\nto be as quickly as possible.\n\n32\n00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.790\nSo that's all coming up\nright here in this episode.\n\n33\n00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.387\n&gt;&gt; So then,\n\n34\n00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:38.966\nhow does Time Machine work?\n&gt;&gt; So Zach, the way a Time Machine works\n\n35\n00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:44.240\nis actually really neat because it\nseems extremely easy to the end user.\n\n36\n00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.000\nIn fact, most of them just turn it on and\nforget they even have it,\n\n37\n00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.680\nbut in the background,\nit's actually pretty complex.\n\n38\n00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.180\nBecause what it's gonna do is it's gonna\ngrab a backup of all of your data,\n\n39\n00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.190\nyour entire disk.\n\n40\n00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.160\nAnd if you've got a one terabyte drive or\nsomething, there's a pretty big chunk of\n\n41\n00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.474\ndata it's gotta back up.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n42\n00:02:01.474 --> 00:02:03.163\n&gt;&gt; Well, if it had to do that backup\n\n43\n00:02:03.163 --> 00:02:08.020\nevery single day, that's a huge amount\nof data that's having to be backed up.\n\n44\n00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.540\nSo what they did with Time Machine\nis they set it up to where\n\n45\n00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.890\nit would take all of your data.\n\n46\n00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.470\nAnd the very first time it runs, yes,\nit backs up your entire set of data,\n\n47\n00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.000\nand that first backup\ncould take hours to run.\n\n48\n00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.290\nBut once it's done, from then on\nit only backs up what changed.\n\n49\n00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.270\nIt doesn't back up everything.\n\n50\n00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.160\nIf something hasn't changed, it's already\ngot a backup of it, it's already there.\n\n51\n00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.410\nSo now it's just backing\nthe changes which are much smaller.\n\n52\n00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.470\nNow it will back up by\ndefault once an hour.\n\n53\n00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.910\nSo it's running every hour.\n\n54\n00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.650\nYou'll have 24 backups a day.\n\n55\n00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.904\nThat sounds like a lot of backups.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n56\n00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:42.897\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna run out of space.\n\n57\n00:02:42.897 --> 00:02:46.490\nBut how much can you change in an hour?\n\n58\n00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.610\nI can only do so much work.\n\n59\n00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.770\nI can only modify couple of documents,\nsend some emails,\n\n60\n00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.880\nwhatever it is that happens in an hour.\n\n61\n00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.670\nAnd that's all it has to backup.\n\n62\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.290\nAnd it does that over and over and\n\n63\n00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.160\nover throughout the day,\nall without us interacting with it.\n\n64\n00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.880\nAll we have to do is plug in a disc and\ntell it, hey, this disc is available for\n\n65\n00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.970\nTime Machine.\n\n66\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.100\nAnd then Time Machine will use it.\n\n67\n00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.840\nAnd that's it,\nthat's the last we interact with it.\n\n68\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.500\nAnd now it's doing those backups and\nwe can come in there and restore.\n\n69\n00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.920\nBy backing up every hour,\nit really creates a safety net for us.\n\n70\n00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.900\nA lot of backup systems out there will\nback up the entire set of data, right?\n\n71\n00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.450\nAnd as a result,\nthere's a big chunk of data.\n\n72\n00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.080\nSo they've gotta do it\nduring a maintenance window,\n\n73\n00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.130\nusually like in the middle of the night.\n\n74\n00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.240\nYou'll hear people say my computer\nis set to back up every day at 3 AM.\n\n75\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.670\nAll right, well, that's fine,\nthat makes sense.\n\n76\n00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.520\nIf you're backing up a large chunk of data\nyou want it to happen at night when you're\n\n77\n00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.420\nnot using the computer so\nit has full access to resources and\n\n78\n00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.840\nit goes in and backs up.\n\n79\n00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.590\nEven if it's just backing up changes,\nyou've got 24 hours of changes, so\n\n80\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.907\nthat can be a pretty big chunk,\nand it's gotta back it up at 3 AM.\n\n81\n00:03:46.907 --> 00:03:51.240\nThe problem there is if I'm\nusing my computer, or maybe not,\n\n82\n00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.370\nit's just sitting there.\n\n83\n00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.268\nAnd at 2 AM, it explodes, catches on fire,\nwhatever, I lose my data, right?\n\n84\n00:03:57.268 --> 00:04:00.680\nWell, a backup was scheduled for 3 AM.\n\n85\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.760\nIt hasn't backed up yet.\n\n86\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.120\nSo I've gotta go to the previous backup,\nwhich was 23 hours earlier.\n\n87\n00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.460\nNow I just lost 23 hours of data.\n\n88\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.400\nBut Time Machine runs every hour.\n\n89\n00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.860\nSo worst case scenario, if I have\na failure and it's been 59 minutes since\n\n90\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.290\nthe last backup, that's the amount\nof data that I would lose, right?\n\n91\n00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.230\nThat's my window of loss,\nI lose 59 minutes of data.\n\n92\n00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.420\nThat's really cool because it's such\na small amount of data that we lose,\n\n93\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.170\njust an hour versus 24 hours or an 8-hour\nworkday, or something of that nature.\n\n94\n00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.240\nAnd it's all happening automatic.\n\n95\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.330\nAnd the way it does this is really cool\nbecause after we get it set up here,\n\n96\n00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.400\nI'll show you on my disk where we can\nbrowse in and we see our files and\n\n97\n00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.970\nour backup database, and\nif you browse into any of the date\n\n98\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.900\nfolders that are on there It looks\nlike the whole set of data is there.\n\n99\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.480\nI might have a hundred folders for\na hundred different backups and\n\n100\n00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.010\nthey all look like they\nhave the whole set of data.\n\n101\n00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.730\nAnd what it does is it copies\na file to the disk one time.\n\n102\n00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.970\nAnd if the file hasn't changed,\nin each of the additional backups,\n\n103\n00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.370\nit just does a hard link to that file.\n\n104\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.930\nSo it looks like there's an entirely\nseparate copy of the file but\n\n105\n00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.280\nif it hasn't changed,\nthey're all linked back to the same data.\n\n106\n00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.150\nSo it takes a very small amount of space.\n\n107\n00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.960\nSo you might be able to have hundreds,\n\n108\n00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.620\neven thousands of backups available\non one external backup disk.\n\n109\n00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.890\nIt's an impressive way that's all handled.\n\n110\n00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.450\nAnd you're really only limited\n\n111\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.940\nby the size of that backup disk that when\nyou finally fill up the backup disk,\n\n112\n00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.110\nTime Machine will start throwing away\nold backups to make room for new ones.\n\n113\n00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.060\nAnd it's simply removing those links and\ngetting that data set down.\n\n114\n00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.190\nSo it's not uncommon to find a Time\nMachine backup disk where people can\n\n115\n00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.730\nrestore back a year, even two years, where\nit just hasn't had to overwrite in that\n\n116\n00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.870\nwindow of time because it's so\nefficient in the way that it stores it.\n\n117\n00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.350\nSo really, really cool stuff.\n&gt;&gt; So Don, what hardware do I need to\n\n118\n00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.140\nuse to use Time Machine?\n&gt;&gt; All right, you got a few choices here.\n\n119\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.390\nYou might not actually\nneed any hardware at all,\n\n120\n00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.940\nyou might already have what you need.\n\n121\n00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.430\nSo for example, you can't any more, but\n\n122\n00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.920\nyou used to be able to buy Mac Minis\nwith two hard drives in them.\n\n123\n00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.680\nYou could use one hard drive as\nyour operating system drive and\n\n124\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.290\nthe other hard drive as\nyour Time Machine disk.\n\n125\n00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.500\nAnd the backups could be happening\ninternally, just internal automatically.\n\n126\n00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.400\nNow, the neat part there is I don't need\nto add anything, we can do it, right?\n\n127\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.579\nThe negative side is,\nwhat happens if my computer is stolen?\n\n128\n00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.200\nI just lost my original data and\n\n129\n00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.840\nthe backup.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n130\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.710\nthe backup.\n&gt;&gt; Or the computer gets fried and\n\n131\n00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.110\nI can't power it on,\nI just lost both disks.\n\n132\n00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.770\nThat's not great, right?\n\n133\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.410\nSo that would prevent software problems,\nI accidentally deleted a file.\n\n134\n00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.730\nIt's okay, it's over here on\nmy Time Machine disk, right?\n\n135\n00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.940\nBut it wouldn't fix physical problems\nlike somebody stealing the device, right?\n\n136\n00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.430\nIf hard drive one failed, well,\nhard drive two is my Time Machine backup,\n\n137\n00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.950\nit's still there and it's good.\n\n138\n00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.060\nYou could,\nI know some people have tried this,\n\n139\n00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.750\nwhere they create a second\npartition on one disk.\n\n140\n00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.150\nYou have one disk and\nyou create a second partition.\n\n141\n00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.090\nAnd by doing that they can leverage a\nsecond partition as a Time Machine backup.\n\n142\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.480\nThat protects you from\nsoftware mistakes as well.\n\n143\n00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.620\nI accidentally deleted a file,\nit's okay, it's in Time Machine.\n\n144\n00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.540\nBut if the hard drive fails, both\npartitions are on the same hard drive.\n\n145\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.460\nIt doesn't protect us.\n\n146\n00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.510\nSo for most of us,\nif we want to implement Time Machine,\n\n147\n00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.970\nthe number one thing we need is\nsome kind of media to back up to.\n\n148\n00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:27.080\nAnd what I typically use is\nsomething like this, right.\n\n149\n00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.170\nThis is a 1 terabyte\nWestern Digital USB disk.\n\n150\n00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.400\nThese things are cheap,\nand easy to implement.\n\n151\n00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.265\nCheap is important for me.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's an important word, yeah.\n\n152\n00:07:39.265 --> 00:07:41.370\n&gt;&gt; In a MacBook like mine, so\n\n153\n00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:46.360\nI have a 500 gig SSD in mine,\nthat's an expensive option.\n\n154\n00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.327\nThat SSD was probably the most expensive\npart of this laptop when Apple\n\n155\n00:07:49.327 --> 00:07:49.988\nassembled it.\n\n156\n00:07:49.988 --> 00:07:53.256\nMore expensive than the monitor,\nthan the CPU,\n\n157\n00:07:53.256 --> 00:07:58.051\ndepending on when you watch this video,\na 500 gig SSD is expensive.\n\n158\n00:07:58.051 --> 00:08:03.440\nThis is a one terabyte traditional disk,\na spinning disk, right?\n\n159\n00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.180\nSo twice the size of my SSD,\nbut this cost $52, right?\n\n160\n00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.537\nVersus that SSD that's like $400.\n\n161\n00:08:10.537 --> 00:08:12.700\nSo you can get disks like\nthis on the cheap, and\n\n162\n00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.531\nit doesn't matter if they're slow because\nyou're just backing data up to them,\n\n163\n00:08:16.531 --> 00:08:17.573\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n164\n00:08:17.573 --> 00:08:18.855\n&gt;&gt; You're not actually running programs\n\n165\n00:08:18.855 --> 00:08:21.607\nfrom this disk, you're just backing it up,\nand hopefully you never need to restore\n\n166\n00:08:21.607 --> 00:08:23.810\nfrom it so it doesn't even matter there,\nbut you backup the disk.\n\n167\n00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.414\nSo, you may need a disk like this,\nall right?\n\n168\n00:08:26.414 --> 00:08:30.320\nAgain, cheap, easy to get, and\nyou can get expensive ones if you want.\n\n169\n00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.540\nThen, depending on your Mac,\nif you're like me you might need this,\n\n170\n00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.070\nI have a MacBook Pro that has no\ntraditional USB ports, I just have USB-C.\n\n171\n00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:45.243\nSo I have a USB to USB-C adapter, that's\npart of our new dongle-enabled world.\n\n172\n00:08:45.243 --> 00:08:47.660\nSo I need this.\n\n173\n00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.268\nNow when you get a brand new disk and\nyou plug it into the system.\n\n174\n00:08:51.268 --> 00:08:54.632\nIf the system has never seen the disk\nbefore, it's actually gonna pop up\n\n175\n00:08:54.632 --> 00:08:57.780\na window and say, hey,\nyou wanna use this for time machine?\n\n176\n00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.380\nSo it's making it that easy to enable.\n\n177\n00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.770\nIf you've used the disc before\nthough it won't ask you.\n\n178\n00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.330\nAnd then you'd have to go in and\ntell time machine to use it.\n\n179\n00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.170\nBut this is kind of the key component\nyou need, some kind of disc, and\n\n180\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.160\nyou can have more than one, right?\n\n181\n00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.361\nMaybe I wanna have one disk that I keep\non-site, right next to my computer, and\n\n182\n00:09:16.361 --> 00:09:20.455\nanother one that I keep off-site,\nin case the building burns down, right?\n\n183\n00:09:20.455 --> 00:09:22.320\nMy disk would burn up.\n\n184\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.640\nSo if I have one off-site,\nI could alternate between the two.\n\n185\n00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.610\nSo I have one connected on even days and\nthe other connected on odd days, and\n\n186\n00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.230\nI always take the other one home with me.\n\n187\n00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.660\nYou can set that up, you would just need\nto buy multiple disks to handle that.\n\n188\n00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.543\nBut having some kind of disk to back up\nto, that's really the only requirement for\n\n189\n00:09:38.543 --> 00:09:42.069\nsetting up time machine.\n&gt;&gt; If someone gets my backup disk,\n\n190\n00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:45.762\ncould they access my information?\n&gt;&gt; So they could, and\n\n191\n00:09:45.762 --> 00:09:47.702\nI mentioned off-site.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n192\n00:09:47.702 --> 00:09:49.750\n&gt;&gt; So let's say I just take this disk and\n\n193\n00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.380\nI leave it in my car, I put it in\nthe glove box, and somebody steals my car.\n\n194\n00:09:54.380 --> 00:10:00.030\nWell, now they've got this disk, which\nconveniently has all of my data on it.\n\n195\n00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.785\nSo if they take it and plug it into\na computer somewhere else, they can browse\n\n196\n00:10:03.785 --> 00:10:07.375\naround, get the data, I have now\ncompromised my information, right?\n\n197\n00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:09.170\nSo that's not a good thing.\n\n198\n00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.960\nSo if we want to really keep this safe,\nwe either need to, one,\n\n199\n00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.250\nkeep these disks locked up, but\na better option is to encrypt it.\n\n200\n00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.920\nWe can encrypt the disk.\n\n201\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.270\nAnd when we enable time machine it's\nactually gonna give us that choice.\n\n202\n00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.480\nDo you want to encrypt the backup?\n\n203\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.760\nAnd that'll get that turned on,\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n204\n00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.970\nLet me show you here with this one.\n\n205\n00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.220\nSo this is a brand new disk,\nI haven't really used it for anything.\n\n206\n00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.050\nSo when I plug in to my Mac, you know,\nI actually have plugged it in before,\n\n207\n00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.589\nI'm not sure if it'll do the pop up here.\n\n208\n00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:41.550\nLet's bring on my desktop,\nand when I plug this in,\n\n209\n00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.170\nit may pop up the time machine box.\n\n210\n00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.979\nLet's see here.\nI'm gonna wait just a second.\n\n211\n00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:50.360\nThe disc will show up here as an icon\nwhen it's ready, there it goes.\n\n212\n00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.170\nAnd if the computer has\nnever seen the disc before,\n\n213\n00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.930\nit'll pop up a message from time machine.\n\n214\n00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.096\nI did plug this one in before the show,\nI shouldn't have.\n\n215\n00:10:57.096 --> 00:10:57.897\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n216\n00:10:57.897 --> 00:11:01.025\n&gt;&gt; So now it views it as something\n\n217\n00:11:01.025 --> 00:11:02.658\npreexistent.\n\n218\n00:11:02.658 --> 00:11:04.940\nIf you wanna see what it\nlooks like if it's brand new,\n\n219\n00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.367\nyou can format the disc, right?\n\n220\n00:11:06.367 --> 00:11:08.350\nSo if I just go into my disc utility.\n\n221\n00:11:10.383 --> 00:11:11.690\nHere's that time machine disk.\n\n222\n00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.450\nSo let's pretend\n\n223\n00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.760\nthat this was a truly brand new disk.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n224\n00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.752\n&gt;&gt; I can erase it, and\n\n225\n00:11:15.752 --> 00:11:19.486\nI'm gonna name it time machine so\nI can remember what I'm using it for.\n\n226\n00:11:19.486 --> 00:11:22.020\nYou can name it whatever you want but\nI always name it time machine so\n\n227\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.460\nI can remember what it was.\n\n228\n00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.290\nAnd then you can format it.\n\n229\n00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:32.120\nIt needs to be Mac OS Extended Journaled\nor APFS, it's got to be one of the two.\n\n230\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.733\nNow my disk is cheap,\nit's a spinning disk.\n\n231\n00:11:35.733 --> 00:11:38.950\nAPFS is tuned for SSDs.\n\n232\n00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.340\nIf this was an SSD, I would pick APFS.\n\n233\n00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.452\nIn fact, my Macintosh HD is an SSD and\nit's using APFS.\n\n234\n00:11:45.452 --> 00:11:47.056\nI'm gonna see how many acronyms\nI can get in one sentence here.\n\n235\n00:11:47.056 --> 00:11:48.321\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Alphabet soup.\n\n236\n00:11:48.321 --> 00:11:50.091\n&gt;&gt; But this one was a spinning disk, so\n\n237\n00:11:50.091 --> 00:11:52.820\nI'm gonna go with\nMac OS Extended Journaled.\n\n238\n00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.940\nNow, there is the encrypted option.\n\n239\n00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.266\nI'm not gonna choose that, right?\n\n240\n00:11:56.266 --> 00:11:59.686\nAnd the reason is, I'm gonna show you here\nin a moment where time machine gives me\n\n241\n00:11:59.686 --> 00:12:02.840\nthe ability to encrypt it, and\nso that's what I'm gonna choose.\n\n242\n00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.424\nBut I'm just gonna go with Mac OS\nExtended Journaled and I'll hit erase, so\n\n243\n00:12:06.424 --> 00:12:07.881\nthat's gonna erase the disk.\n\n244\n00:12:07.881 --> 00:12:12.270\nAnd once it's erased, now it will be\nthe first time my computer sees it.\n\n245\n00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.280\nAnd so as soon as it's done erasing,\nthat icon is gonna appear.\n\n246\n00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.230\nAnd then right away I get the pop-up,\ndo you want\n\n247\n00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.131\nto use time machine with this disk, right?\n&gt;&gt; I guess we do.\n\n248\n00:12:22.131 --> 00:12:24.830\n&gt;&gt; They're trying to make it super easy.\n\n249\n00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:31.670\nAnd right here on this same screen, do I\nwant to encrypt the backup disk, okay?\n\n250\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.210\nI can choose to enable that encryption.\n\n251\n00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.264\nNow if I choose it, the disk is encrypted.\n\n252\n00:12:37.264 --> 00:12:42.450\nIf somebody steals that disk, they\ncan't get at my data, it's safe, right?\n\n253\n00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.580\nIf I use it, I'm able to unlock it.\n\n254\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.130\nIt's tied to my keychain, I can get at it,\n\n255\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:50.100\ngive it the information, and recover my\ndata, there's no big deal there at all.\n\n256\n00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.130\nSo this is a good idea no matter\nwhat environment you're in.\n\n257\n00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.258\nIf you're a home user, an enterprise user,\nif you work for a spy agency.\n\n258\n00:12:56.258 --> 00:13:00.770\nIt's good practice to encrypt\nyour backup disk, right?\n\n259\n00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:04.398\nNow I'm gonna choose,\nI'll do decide later.\n\n260\n00:13:04.398 --> 00:13:07.430\nBecause I wanna show you how to manually\ndo this to the time machine window here\n\n261\n00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.430\nin just a moment.\n\n262\n00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.110\nBut if you do it that way,\nthat's how easy time machine is.\n\n263\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.450\nYou check encrypt and\nyou check use disk, and that's it.\n\n264\n00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:15.790\nTime machine just does its thing.\n\n265\n00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.015\nWithin two minutes it'll start\nthe first full backup of your computer,\n\n266\n00:13:19.015 --> 00:13:20.880\nbackup all of your data.\n\n267\n00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.860\nAnd then after that,\nthat might take hours,\n\n268\n00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.600\nafter that, it then backs up once\nan hour or here to eternity, right?\n\n269\n00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.310\nAs long as the disk is plugged in,\nit backs it up and you get the data.\n\n270\n00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.730\nSo encrypting it,\nreally not a hard thing to do.\n\n271\n00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.220\nNow if we wanna see like just\nactually getting it enabled,\n\n272\n00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.150\nI'm gonna call it the hard way,\nit's not really hard, but\n\n273\n00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.110\nmaybe I chose don't use time machine and\nthen I change my mind.\n\n274\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.060\nDown the road I'm like, well, all right,\nlet's put in use time machine.\n\n275\n00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.750\nThen you can go into system preferences,\nand\n\n276\n00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.410\nyou've actually got the time machine\nsystem preference right there.\n\n277\n00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:58.710\nAnd if we go into that,\nI've got where I can select a backup disc.\n\n278\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.800\nSo if I had ignored that little prompt,\nI can come in and\n\n279\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.500\nhit select backup disc, and\nnow is my chance to come in and\n\n280\n00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.070\nI can pick the disc right there, so\nI'll say I'm gonna pick time machine.\n\n281\n00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:13.160\nAnd I can choose to encrypt the backups\nand I can say use disk, and\n\n282\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.800\nthat's gonna be the equivalent as if\nI just chose it on the other screen.\n\n283\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.220\nI do need to pick a password for\nthis backup, right?\n\n284\n00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.860\nSo I'll set my super secret password,\n\n285\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:28.270\nand we set that, and then a password hint.\n\n286\n00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:32.020\nNow on some of the password screens,\nApple makes them optional.\n\n287\n00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.570\nOn this one, it requires a password hint.\n\n288\n00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.223\nWell, I'll tell you guys,\nI do not like password hints.\n\n289\n00:14:38.223 --> 00:14:38.778\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n290\n00:14:38.778 --> 00:14:40.570\n&gt;&gt; Because either I'm gonna remember my\n\n291\n00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:41.970\npassword or I'm not.\n\n292\n00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.490\nIf I don't, it's my own fault.\n\n293\n00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.370\nIf somebody else gets this disk,\nI don't wanna give them a hint.\n\n294\n00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.098\nSo I usually end up typing none.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.214\n&gt;&gt; I have to type something, so\n\n296\n00:14:51.214 --> 00:14:52.571\nI'm just gonna put in, no hints.\n\n297\n00:14:52.571 --> 00:14:55.550\nAnd so I'll go ahead and do that,\nand I'll hit encrypt disk.\n\n298\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.270\nNow, it's preparing the disk.\n\n299\n00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.839\nAnd this is where it's actually getting a\nset up to be an encrypted disk to protect\n\n300\n00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:03.150\nthat information.\n\n301\n00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.230\nAnd now it's gonna start the first backup.\n\n302\n00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.535\nRemember I said two minutes?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm..\n\n303\n00:15:07.535 --> 00:15:10.260\n&gt;&gt; It starts a 120-second timer.\n\n304\n00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.040\nIt's timing down and\nthen it's gonna start that first backup.\n\n305\n00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.360\nAnd it tells me it's gonna do hourly\nbackups for the last 24 hours.\n\n306\n00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.360\nAnd then it'll have daily backups from the\npast month, and then weekly backups for\n\n307\n00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:29.060\nall previous months back as far as it\ncan go until the hard drive gets full.\n\n308\n00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.760\nThere's only one more\noption on this screen and\n\n309\n00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.870\nthat's show time machine in the menu bar,\nI actually like to turn that on.\n\n310\n00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.460\nBecause what that does,\n\n311\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.120\nis it adds a little time machine\nicon right here in your menu bar.\n\n312\n00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.780\nAnd that's really useful\nbecause when you click it,\n\n313\n00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.990\nit'll tell you if you're backing up now.\n\n314\n00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.870\nAnd if you're not,\nit'll tell you when the last backup was.\n\n315\n00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.787\nSo I can see, I backed up an hour ago or I\nbacked up 15 minutes ago, you can see it.\n\n316\n00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:56.175\nI usually keep this option\nturned on on my Mac so\n\n317\n00:15:56.175 --> 00:15:58.576\nthat I can tell whether\na backup has occurred.\n\n318\n00:15:58.576 --> 00:16:00.024\nSo I like to turn that option on.\n\n319\n00:16:00.024 --> 00:16:03.240\nBut at this point,\nit's about to run that backup.\n\n320\n00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.140\nBut if I bring up my disk utility and\nI come in here,\n\n321\n00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.900\nI can see that western\ndigital elements disk, right?\n\n322\n00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:15.810\nAnd so here it shows up as that external\nphysical disk, and if I look at that\n\n323\n00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:22.140\nTime Machine volume, I can see that it's\nMAC OS extended, journaled, encrypted.\n\n324\n00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.240\nI didn't format it encrypted earlier.\n\n325\n00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.860\nIt made it encrypted after the fact.\n\n326\n00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.980\nAnd so now it's set up to do that.\n\n327\n00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:33.480\nIt's encrypted and, in a moment,\nit's going to get backup data sent to it.\n\n328\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.470\nNow, it doesn't have backup data yet,\nand I know that because,\n\n329\n00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.440\nsee how the disk icon shows up here?\n\n330\n00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.140\nIt's yellow and just says Time Machine.\n\n331\n00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.410\nWhen there's a full back up,\n\n332\n00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:47.520\nwhen at least one back up is successful,\nthis disk will appear green.\n\n333\n00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.210\nAnd it'll have the Time Machine symbol.\n\n334\n00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.370\nThis symbol right here,\n\n335\n00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.820\nthe clock with a backwards arrow,\nthat will show up on the disk.\n\n336\n00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.620\nThat's how you can tell at\nleast one back up is done.\n\n337\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.630\nBut on mine that could take\nawhile because well actually\n\n338\n00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.350\nit shouldn't take too terribly long shoot\nI shouldn't have closed that screen.\n\n339\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:07.620\nLet me get back into my Time Machine\npreference it just started there we go.\n\n340\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.490\nSee how it says preparing to backup?\n\n341\n00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:10.430\nIn a moment it's gonna start\n\n342\n00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.310\nthe actual backup\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n343\n00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:12.390\n&gt;&gt; And it's gonna tell me how long it's\n\n344\n00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.410\ngoing to take.\n\n345\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.300\nBut at this point I do know\nthe disk is encrypted and\n\n346\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.960\neverything that's being written to\nit is gonna be nice, safe, secure.\n\n347\n00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.460\nAnd there goes the backup.\n\n348\n00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.130\nIt's gonna crank up, and we'll see here\nin a moment how long that's going to\n\n349\n00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.080\ntake.\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, what happens if I forget\n\n350\n00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.910\nto connect my disk?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so everything I've told you so\n\n351\n00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.450\nfar has been under the assumption\nthat the disk is plugged in, right?\n\n352\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.000\nWell I've got a laptop.\n\n353\n00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.080\nI take it home, I bring it back.\n\n354\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.490\nWhat if I come in one day and\nI forget to plug in the disk?\n\n355\n00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.700\nWell, it can't do a time\nmachine back up can it?\n\n356\n00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.980\nIt expects the disk to be there.\n\n357\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.330\nWell, what Apple did is they said,\nall right, people travel.\n\n358\n00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.460\nYou might go on a trip for\nthree or four days.\n\n359\n00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.150\nAnd when you come back, it's not\nlike you didn't want to backup for\n\n360\n00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.760\nthree or four days.\n\n361\n00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.590\nYou just couldn't, you were travelling.\n\n362\n00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.650\nIt actually maintains a local backup.\n\n363\n00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.150\nA backup right on the hard drive, right\nalong side with your operating system.\n\n364\n00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.840\nNow, because it's stored\nwith the operating system,\n\n365\n00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.620\nyou're not protected\nfrom a hardware failure.\n\n366\n00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.990\nIf somebody steals my laptop\nI lose this local backup.\n\n367\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.890\nIf my hard drive fails I\nlose the local backup.\n\n368\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.160\nBut if I make a software mistake,\nif I just accidentally delete some files,\n\n369\n00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.640\nI can restore them because their\nstored right there along side the OS.\n\n370\n00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.410\nAnd when I get back to the office and\n\n371\n00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.810\nI plug that disk in, it will transfer\nthe local backups over to that disk.\n\n372\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.110\nSo now they're not local anymore and\nI've got the backups.\n\n373\n00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.990\nAll right.\n\n374\n00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.770\nI don't think I will have any just yet\nbecause I just turned on the Time Machine.\n\n375\n00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.190\nBut let me see if it created\nthe directory for us.\n\n376\n00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.540\nThe local backup.\n\n377\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.370\nAnd I'm gonna make this bigger so\nwe can actually see it.\n\n378\n00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:47.240\nIf you open up a terminal and\nbrowse to the slash volumes folder,\n\n379\n00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.410\nthat's where any mounted\nhard drive would show up.\n\n380\n00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.330\ni can see on my desk top I've got\nMacintosh HD and Time Machine.\n\n381\n00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.390\nAnd if I take a look in there,\nI can see Macintosh HD.\n\n382\n00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.620\nI can see Time Machine.\n\n383\n00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:01.805\nAnd then this folder is showing\nup a really long unfriendly name.\n\n384\n00:19:01.805 --> 00:19:05.630\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.localsnapshots.\n\n385\n00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.440\nRight?\n\n386\n00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:11.360\nThose local snapshots, those are back\nups that Time Machine has taken\n\n387\n00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.200\nwhen a Time Machine disk wasn't present.\n\n388\n00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.830\nSo instead of backing\nup to an external disk,\n\n389\n00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.510\nthey're backed up to this\nlittle folder right here.\n\n390\n00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.920\nAnd that folder can only grow so much.\n\n391\n00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.180\nRight?\nEventually it's going to run out of space.\n\n392\n00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.760\nSo, it's not reliable for\nlong periods of time.\n\n393\n00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.010\nBut, if you're going to be travelling for\na few days, you can skip your backups, and\n\n394\n00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.130\nwhen you come back to your office,\nthe changes get stuck in here and\n\n395\n00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.290\nget sent over to that disk and\nbecome available, right?\n\n396\n00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:38.900\nAnd so, that will happen over time.\n\n397\n00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.390\nAnd some people really like that feature,\nit's nice.\n\n398\n00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.410\nSome people hate that feature, right?\n\n399\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:48.290\nMaybe you had one of the early\nMacBooks to offer SSDs.\n\n400\n00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:52.510\nThe original SSDs were only 128\ngigs in size, they're pretty small.\n\n401\n00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.440\nAnd so you can fill that up pretty easy.\n\n402\n00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.280\nYou might not want to waste\nspace on a backup like that.\n\n403\n00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.460\nSo if you don't want that,\nyou can actually turn it off.\n\n404\n00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.950\nThis is enabled by default.\n\n405\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.090\nIt's set up to be able\nto do these backups.\n\n406\n00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.460\nThere is a command utility.\n\n407\n00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.530\nSo if you run sudo,\nyou have to be an administrator.\n\n408\n00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.030\nSo super user do.\n\n409\n00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.940\nSudo tmutil.\n\n410\n00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.810\nTmutil is the time machine utility,\nthe command line interface for this.\n\n411\n00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:24.190\nAnd I can say sudo tmutil disable local,\nlike that.\n\n412\n00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:27.140\nAnd if I run that command,\nit will tell Time Machine, hey,\n\n413\n00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.260\nyou either back up to a time\nmachine disk or you don't back up.\n\n414\n00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.330\nIt disables this local snapshot.\n\n415\n00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:37.630\nIf I wanna turn it back on,\nI can just say tmutll enablelocal,\n\n416\n00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.990\nlike that, and that'll turn it back on.\n\n417\n00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.089\nNow, I personally do like to have it\nturned on, but I've got a 500G disc, so\n\n418\n00:20:45.089 --> 00:20:46.780\nI've got extra room for it.\n\n419\n00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.830\nIf I was running tight on space,\n\n420\n00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.110\nit would be one of the first\nthings that I turned off.\n\n421\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.107\nHey if I'm traveling I'm probably\nnot creating documents of any\n\n422\n00:20:54.107 --> 00:20:55.318\nsubstantial need.\n\n423\n00:20:55.318 --> 00:20:56.510\nIt's okay if I lose them and\n\n424\n00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:00.360\nhave to restore back to back up from a few\ndays earlier but also if you have things\n\n425\n00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.620\nlike iCloud you might not be as\nreliant on a time machine back up.\n\n426\n00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.180\nIf my documents are all synced I\ndon't necessarily need anything else\n\n427\n00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.460\nbeyond that.\n\n428\n00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.490\nThe local cache here might\nnot be useful to me.\n\n429\n00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.410\nSo just be aware that if\nyour disk isn't plugged in,\n\n430\n00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.450\nthat you've at least got that available.\n\n431\n00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:18.470\nYou'll be able to find it there.\n\n432\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:23.837\nNow in macOS I Sierra,\n10.13 and Sierra 10.12,\n\n433\n00:21:23.837 --> 00:21:28.550\nthe folder is called\nCom.Apple.TimeMachine.LocalSnapshots.\n\n434\n00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:34.260\nBut if you're running an earlier one,\nlike El Capitan or earlier, really I think\n\n435\n00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:39.290\nit's 10.11 and earlier, this folder\nused to be called mobile backups.\n\n436\n00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:44.530\nA friendlier name, but I think people\ngot kind of confused because it\n\n437\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:48.140\nwould say mobile backups even if you were\non an iMac that wasn't a mobile device,\n\n438\n00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.400\nso they ended up changing that.\n\n439\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.950\nBut you may see that other folder\nname if you're in an older version\n\n440\n00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.802\nof Mac OS.\n&gt;&gt; Can I share a Time Machine disk with\n\n441\n00:21:56.802 --> 00:22:01.760\nmultiple Macs?\n&gt;&gt; You can, it doesn't work so\n\n442\n00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.190\nwell though.\n\n443\n00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.130\nLike when I plug in a disc,\nI'm backing up here right?\n\n444\n00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.600\nSo it creates this folder,\nactually, you know what?\n\n445\n00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.070\nI've got a green icon here.\n\n446\n00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.110\nRemember the green icon I mentioned?\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n447\n00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.248\n&gt;&gt; If we take a look at my icon on\n\n448\n00:22:14.248 --> 00:22:16.440\nthe desktop, that hard drive turned green-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n449\n00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.000\n&gt;&gt; And it's got the Time\n\n450\n00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.070\nMachine icon on it.\n\n451\n00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.620\nNow I don't, I can't imagine\nwe're actually done, are we?\n\n452\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.770\nNah, it's still cranking along.\n\n453\n00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:24.680\nWell anyhow, it thinks\n\n454\n00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.480\nit's done enough to give it the icon.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n455\n00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.720\n&gt;&gt; But if I browse into that disk.\n\n456\n00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.870\nWhat I'm going to see is a folder.\n\n457\n00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:33.330\nThe folder's called Backups.backupdb,\nit's my backup database.\n\n458\n00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.390\nAnd if I expand that out,\nI see Don's Macbook Pro.\n\n459\n00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.230\nIt's got a folder just for me.\n\n460\n00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:42.240\nAnd if I browse into that, I'll start to\nsee each of the backups that are present.\n\n461\n00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.460\nI see my first backup occurring\nright there, all right.\n\n462\n00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.740\nAt first glance,\n\n463\n00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.660\nit looks like I could have more\nthan one computer in here, right?\n\n464\n00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.450\nBecause you got a separate folder, right?\n\n465\n00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.020\nSo it seems like we could do that.\n\n466\n00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.490\nBut the logistics of\nmoving this disk back and\n\n467\n00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:00.470\nforth between different computers\nis a little bit unrealistic, right?\n\n468\n00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:01.330\nPeople are going to forget.\n\n469\n00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:02.390\nThey're not going to do it.\n\n470\n00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.000\nAlso, I encrypted mine.\n\n471\n00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.010\nAnd since it's encrypted well\nany time I move it back and\n\n472\n00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.850\nforth to another computer I've gotta\nunlock it there before people are able to\n\n473\n00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.420\nbackup to it, so that creates a bit\nof a challenge there as well.\n\n474\n00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.460\nSo it's not really ideal to\nshare a physical disk like this.\n\n475\n00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.210\nIf you wanna have a centralized shared\nTime Machine backup what you should\n\n476\n00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.940\nreally do is leverage the network\nbackup functionality of Time Machine.\n\n477\n00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:31.420\nWhen you backup, backing up to a local\ndisk is kinda the normal process.\n\n478\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.570\nBut if you're worried about\npeople forgetting their disks, or\n\n479\n00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.320\nyou want people to be able to have\nall their backups in one place,\n\n480\n00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.560\nyou can use either a machine\nrunning Mac OS server.\n\n481\n00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:48.240\nOr a TimeVault, or they have the Apple\nairport wireless access points, so\n\n482\n00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.040\nthey also have the vault version of that\nwhere it has hard drives inside of it, and\n\n483\n00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.980\nyou can use that as a backup destination.\n\n484\n00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.927\nOr there's tons of third-party storage\nappliances that you can use as backup\n\n485\n00:23:57.927 --> 00:23:59.018\ndestinations also.\n\n486\n00:23:59.018 --> 00:24:00.967\nWe have that here in the office.\n\n487\n00:24:00.967 --> 00:24:03.937\nIn fact, it probably even showed up and\nI just wasn't paying attention.\n\n488\n00:24:03.937 --> 00:24:07.310\nWhen I turned on Time Machine and\nI went to Select Disk, let's see.\n\n489\n00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.480\nYeah, there they are.\n\n490\n00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:10.710\nI see my local disk.\n\n491\n00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:14.700\nI've got this Time Machine disk,\nthat's encrypted, that's available.\n\n492\n00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.170\nBut if I look down beneath that,\nI've got TMBackup.\n\n493\n00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.850\nThese are two storage appliances that\nwe have back in our server room.\n\n494\n00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:25.890\nAnd they're showing up on there,\nI can back up to them.\n\n495\n00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:28.720\nWell, we have eight or nine different\ndevices that are backing up to them,\n\n496\n00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.350\nit's a shared location to\nback up that data tube.\n\n497\n00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.206\nAnd the cool part here is\nit's over the network.\n\n498\n00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:38.918\nSo if I take my laptop home I'm just\nbacking up to that local cache.\n\n499\n00:24:38.918 --> 00:24:41.598\nBut whenever I come here to work it\nsees that I'm on the network and\n\n500\n00:24:41.598 --> 00:24:44.003\nit's ours backing up,\nI don't have to plug in and drive.\n\n501\n00:24:44.003 --> 00:24:46.503\nIt just knows hey, I'm at work,\nthere's that destination,\n\n502\n00:24:46.503 --> 00:24:47.690\nI'll start backing up to it.\n\n503\n00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.870\nAnd you'll see where we can add Other\nAirPort Time Capsule, that was the word.\n\n504\n00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.010\nI said time vault earlier,\nit's a Time Capsule.\n\n505\n00:24:55.010 --> 00:25:00.040\nAnd that's the access point that\nactually has hard drives in it.\n\n506\n00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.060\nApple has been a little wishy-washy on\nwhether they're gonna discontinue those\n\n507\n00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.060\nor not.\n\n508\n00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.390\nSo, if you're just starting out setting up\nnetwork shared storage, I wouldn't advise\n\n509\n00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.870\ngoing with Time Capsule, unless Apple\nannounces they're gonna make another one.\n\n510\n00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.940\nIt seems like this current version\nis gonna be the last version,\n\n511\n00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.760\ncuz they haven't updated\nit in three years.\n\n512\n00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.520\nThat's a long time for\nApple to go without updating a product.\n\n513\n00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.670\nAnd I know the Airports,\nthey have discontinued those.\n\n514\n00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.920\nAnd the Time Capsule is just\nan airport that has hard drives in it.\n\n515\n00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.800\nSo, the writing's on the wall there.\n\n516\n00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.880\nTime capsules are probably going away.\n\n517\n00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:38.940\nYou're better off using either third\nparty storage,or using another Mac that's\n\n518\n00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.380\nrunning Mac OS server, and then it can act\nas a time machine back up destination.\n\n519\n00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.990\nSo, that's the best way to\nshare a time machine between\n\n520\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.800\nsystems.\n&gt;&gt; So, Don, how do we restore a file from\n\n521\n00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.450\na time machine?\n&gt;&gt; All right, once we have a good,\n\n522\n00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:55.010\nclean backup, then we're storing\nthe files really pretty easy.\n\n523\n00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.530\nI don't have a good,\nclean backup just yet.\n\n524\n00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.940\nI'm still waiting on this one to finish,\nbut what happens is,\n\n525\n00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.020\nanytime you want to recover something.\n\n526\n00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.870\nYou would simply browse on to your disk,\nand\n\n527\n00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.762\nbrowse to wherever it is you store things.\n\n528\n00:26:07.762 --> 00:26:14.750\nSo maybe here in my documents folder, I've\ngot this awsdemo.pem, it's a private key.\n\n529\n00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:19.150\nSo, if I delete that and then I say,\nman, I need that file back.\n\n530\n00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.890\nWhat you would do,\nis you browse that folder.\n\n531\n00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.679\nAnd then you would do what's\ncalled entering time machine.\n\n532\n00:26:26.679 --> 00:26:30.909\nIf I browse the folder\nthat I wanna look at, and\n\n533\n00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:34.064\nI go to my Time Machine menu up top.\n\n534\n00:26:34.064 --> 00:26:37.070\nSee the option right\nhere Enter Time Machine?\n\n535\n00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:42.360\nI can enter time machine, and\nwhen I do that my screen is gonna change.\n\n536\n00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.190\nTo give me this view right here.\n\n537\n00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.680\nAnd what it's doing is it's\nshowing me today, now.\n\n538\n00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:53.650\nAnd I can use these arrows\nto move back in time to see,\n\n539\n00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:57.920\nwell, for me, see how I've got where it\nsays documents on that window behind it.\n\n540\n00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.650\n&gt;&gt; All these other ones are blank.\n\n541\n00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:02.350\nWell, after I've been\nrunning this a few months,\n\n542\n00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:07.140\nall of these would be previous backups,\nbackups from yesterday, day before,\n\n543\n00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.085\nweek ago, month ago-\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n544\n00:27:09.085 --> 00:27:10.410\n&gt;&gt; Back years, and\n\n545\n00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:14.030\nyou can use these little arrows\nto move back between those.\n\n546\n00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:18.420\nHere's today at 11:50 AM versus right now.\n\n547\n00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.430\nOr, if you move your cursor over\nto the right side of the screen,\n\n548\n00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:23.430\nthere's actually a timeline.\n\n549\n00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.780\nMy head's gonna cover this up, but\nif I zoom in on it you can kinda see it.\n\n550\n00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.660\nCan we get my head out of the way?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n551\n00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.510\n&gt;&gt; My giant noggin.\n\n552\n00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.210\nThere we go.\n\n553\n00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.300\nAnd so you'll see where I've got now and\ntoday.\n\n554\n00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:35.925\nAnd see how I can just\n\n555\n00:27:35.925 --> 00:27:38.010\nkinda like slide between those?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n556\n00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:40.570\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not very exciting here, but\n\n557\n00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:46.590\nif I wanna go back months or years, you\ncan use this quick timeline to scroll and\n\n558\n00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.167\nbe able to see that.\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n559\n00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:50.974\n&gt;&gt; Versus clicking this arrow 365 times\n\n560\n00:27:50.974 --> 00:27:52.382\nto get to last year.\n\n561\n00:27:52.382 --> 00:27:56.535\nSo basically you just go through and you\nfind the file that you wanna recover, and\n\n562\n00:27:56.535 --> 00:28:00.197\nwhen you find it, if you just wanna\nput it back, you click on the file and\n\n563\n00:28:00.197 --> 00:28:03.060\nthen you click Restore,\nand then it puts it back.\n\n564\n00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.860\nIf it was deleted.\n\n565\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.230\nBut maybe you're just wanting to say hmm,\nI've got this document.\n\n566\n00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:09.930\nThis is what it looks like right now.\n\n567\n00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.850\nWhat did it look like a month ago?\n\n568\n00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.570\nI don't necessarily wanna\noverwrite what I have right now,\n\n569\n00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.350\nI just wanna see what it\nlooked like a month ago.\n\n570\n00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.380\nSo I could find it,\n\n571\n00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:22.180\nand then instead of hitting Restore,\nyou can two finger click on it.\n\n572\n00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:27.480\nAnd you can choose copy, and you can copy\nit, and then paste it wherever you want.\n\n573\n00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.890\nSo you can paste it into\na different location, and\n\n574\n00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:33.790\nthat way you don't have to go in and\noverwrite the new one.\n\n575\n00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.310\nYou can also use quick look to say,\njust open it up and\n\n576\n00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.790\nlet me see what it looked it a month ago.\n\n577\n00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:43.190\nSo that's basically the interface that we\nget at, so recovering an individual file,\n\n578\n00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.750\nrecovering a folder, super easy.\n\n579\n00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.810\nYou just browse to that folder, and\n\n580\n00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.970\nthen use the menu item from\nTime Machine to enter the Time Machine.\n\n581\n00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.890\nAnd once you're there,\nyou can find everything as it was back\n\n582\n00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.050\nbefore Time Machine did its job.\n&gt;&gt; Okay last curve ball,\n\n583\n00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:02.820\nwhat if our entire system needs restoring?\n&gt;&gt; I've\n\n584\n00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:07.300\nbeen talking about if you delete a file,\nor you modify a file by accident,\n\n585\n00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.710\nsomething like that,\nWhat if your whole system is hosed?\n\n586\n00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.760\nWell, you can recover your entire\ncomputer from Time Machine.\n\n587\n00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.980\nIn fact we have an episode on doing OS\nrecovery, and I talk about it in that\n\n588\n00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:23.170\nepisode, that there's a recovery partition\nhidden on the Time Machine disk.\n\n589\n00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:28.130\nSo this hard drive here actually has\na recovery partition built into it.\n\n590\n00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:31.814\nAnd that means that I can plug this\nTime Machine disk into any Mac.\n\n591\n00:29:31.814 --> 00:29:35.100\nAnd if I boot while holding\nthe Option key down,\n\n592\n00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:39.138\nI'll see this Time Machine\ndisk as a possible boot drive.\n\n593\n00:29:39.138 --> 00:29:42.930\nAnd if I choose it as my startup disk,\nI'll boot from it.\n\n594\n00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.390\nIt'll boot into recovery, and\nI can choose to restore from Time Machine.\n\n595\n00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:51.160\nAnd when you do it that way,\nit restores the entire system.\n\n596\n00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.890\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n597\n00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.000\n&gt;&gt; All of your files,\n\n598\n00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.250\nall of any other users files,\n\n599\n00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.670\nthe entire operating system files,\nall gets restored and recovered.\n\n600\n00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:58.390\nReally handy.\n\n601\n00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.820\nIf you have a hard drive failure,\n\n602\n00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.820\nyou could put a blank hard\ndrive in your computer.\n\n603\n00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:07.200\nBoot off your Time Machine disk, and\nwhen you restore, it puts everything back,\n\n604\n00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.640\nincluding MacOS all right the way that\nit needs to be, and you're back up and\n\n605\n00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.820\nrunning in short order.\n\n606\n00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.550\nCheck out the OS recovery episode\nif you wanna see how to do that.\n\n607\n00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:16.420\nIt's a pretty straightforward\nprocess though.\n\n608\n00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.020\nAnd it makes Time Machine all that much\nmore valuable, cuz you can recover really\n\n609\n00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:24.920\nfrom any failure as long as you did it, as\nlong as you took the Time Machine backup.\n\n610\n00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.525\nIf you didn't take the backup\nin the first place,\n\n611\n00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:31.390\nthen it doesn't help you one single bit.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, that was so Time Machine,\n\n612\n00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:33.870\nit seems like we've done it before.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n613\n00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:34.920\n&gt;&gt; Before we move on,\n\n614\n00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.890\nanything else you'd like to say Don.\n&gt;&gt; One last thing, Time Machine is so\n\n615\n00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:40.310\neasy to turn on.\n\n616\n00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:42.720\nAnd it's so\nreliable as far as doing its backups,\n\n617\n00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.880\nthat's it's easy to\nforget you're running it.\n\n618\n00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.170\nYou just forget about it,\nand it does its thing.\n\n619\n00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.960\nWell, make a note, make a little\ncalendar item at least once a month.\n\n620\n00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.060\nCheck your Time Machine,\ncheck, browse into that drive,\n\n621\n00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.190\ndoes it have your backups?\n\n622\n00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:57.050\nWhen was the last time a backup ran?\n\n623\n00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.820\nTest restoring a file.\n\n624\n00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.680\nBecause sooner or later my\nTime Machine drive is gonna wear out.\n\n625\n00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.190\nAnd when it wears out it's gonna fail.\n\n626\n00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.900\nAnd I might not notice.\n\n627\n00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.640\nSo, I don't wanna have\na real failure occur, and\n\n628\n00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.900\nthen I go to my Time Machine disk and\nI find out, I just failed.\n\n629\n00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.510\nThere's nothing worse than\nthinking you've got a backup and\n\n630\n00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.840\nthen finding out that you really don't,\nand now you lose data.\n\n631\n00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.700\nSo, be sure to examine that and\nmake sure that your Time Machine disks\n\n632\n00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.370\nare operational.\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.171\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.171 --> 00:00:14.960\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITPro.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.060\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.480\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.055\nAs we continue on with Apple's\ncertified support professionals,\n\n8\n00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:23.800\nwe're gonna be managing\napplications today.\n\n9\n00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.800\nThat sounds cool, and the person\nhelping us with that is the one and\n\n10\n00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.590\nonly Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.000\nDon good to see you, sirt.\n\n12\n00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.885\n&gt;&gt; It is good to see you, Zach, and\njumping back into the world of Mac OS,\n\n13\n00:00:32.885 --> 00:00:35.980\nwe're gonna be taking a look\nat installing application,\n\n14\n00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.990\nnow we manages them inside Mac OS.\n\n15\n00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.146\nWe'll see there's actually several\ndifferent ways we get uploaded under our\n\n16\n00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:42.390\nsystem and work with it.\n\n17\n00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.598\nSo we're gonna walk through\nthese different ways and\n\n18\n00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:47.691\nwe'll see which way is preferred in\ncertain scenarios versus others, and\n\n19\n00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:50.929\nthen just general things that we need to\nbe aware of when it comes to controlling\n\n20\n00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.916\nthe applications that\nare installed in our OS.\n\n21\n00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:54.800\nSo that's what we've got lined\nup right here in this episode.\n\n22\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.210\n&gt;&gt; So what methods are available for\ninstalling applications in Mac OS?\n\n23\n00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthere's two main methods.\n\n24\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.453\nAnd the terminology kind of goes back and\nforth, but the primary method,\n\n25\n00:01:05.453 --> 00:01:09.078\nthe method that Apple wants us to use,\nyou have to use the App Store.\n\n26\n00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:10.060\nThe Apple App Store [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.065\n&gt;&gt; You go in there.\nFind apps, download them, install them.\n\n28\n00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:12.930\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n29\n00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.150\n&gt;&gt; The old method, though, that we used\nbefore there were app stores was that you\n\n30\n00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.620\nwould go to websites and\njust download apps.\n\n31\n00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.430\nAnd now they call that side loading,\nright?\n\n32\n00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.930\nSide loading means installing\nan app through any means\n\n33\n00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.820\nother than the App Store.\n\n34\n00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.350\nAnd that's not a hard thing to do.\n\n35\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.380\nAnd in fact, in the olden days\nthat was the way we did it.\n\n36\n00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.090\nYou can still do that today as well.\n\n37\n00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.050\nSo kinda two different primary methods\nthere for getting apps installed.\n\n38\n00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, is the App Store\nthe preferred method, though?\n\n39\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.270\n&gt;&gt; For most people it is.\n\n40\n00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.730\nAnd for Apple it definitely is.\n\n41\n00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.470\nSo I said,\nthis is Apple's recommended method.\n\n42\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.110\nBut it's not always the preferred method,\nand I'll give you some examples\n\n43\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.120\nhere in a few moments, but let's just\nstart out with when it is preferred.\n\n44\n00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.700\nThe nice thing about the Apple App Store\nis that if you want an app, you don't have\n\n45\n00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.250\nto go to Google, or Bing, or\nsome search engine, and search for an app.\n\n46\n00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.330\nAnd hope you've found your\nway to a reputable website.\n\n47\n00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.930\nAnd hope that you're downloading\na safe version of that file,\n\n48\n00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.300\nthat hasn't been compromised.\n\n49\n00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.235\nThat doesn't have malware or\nadvertising in it.\n\n50\n00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:13.755\nThat there's a lot of hope,\n\n51\n00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:16.940\n[LAUGH] when you're going out there on\nthe Internet just randomly finding things.\n\n52\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.080\nWith the App Store, what you see\nis a curated list of applications.\n\n53\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.870\nWhere a human being at Apple has actually\nperformed some kind of review on that app\n\n54\n00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.334\nto make sure that it's okay to\nadmit it into the App Store.\n\n55\n00:02:30.334 --> 00:02:33.967\nAnd when you install it,\nthe file is actually coming from Apple, so\n\n56\n00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:36.840\nthat you know it hasn't\nbeen tampered with.\n\n57\n00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.540\nAnd it installs, and you have a reasonable\nexpectation of safety in that app.\n\n58\n00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.180\nAnd the App Store is included in Mac OS by\ndefault, so for example, here on my Mac\n\n59\n00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.850\nif I look down here in my Dock, and\nI've I've changed my default icons but\n\n60\n00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.020\nthe App Store is one of the default\nicons in a new install.\n\n61\n00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.340\nIf you removed the icon it's just\ninside your Applications folder.\n\n62\n00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.015\nAnd when you fire up that App Store,\nwhat you are going to see is, well,\n\n63\n00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:04.632\nkinda of a high level overview some\nof the apps that are available, and\n\n64\n00:03:04.632 --> 00:03:09.140\nwe've looked at this in previous episodes\nbecause of the update functionality here.\n\n65\n00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.490\nRight, so we can update Mac OS\nfrom inside the App Store.\n\n66\n00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.046\nBut if I'm looking for an app, if I want\nto go and find something and install it,\n\n67\n00:03:17.046 --> 00:03:18.819\nI can find it here, all right?\n\n68\n00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.875\nNow for example, I use a custom\nfile manager pretty frequently,\n\n69\n00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.099\na little program called ForkLift.\n\n70\n00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.653\nThe way I discovered ForkLift was\nnot from a friend or word of mouth.\n\n71\n00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:32.180\nI actually discovered it through\nthe App Store right here.\n\n72\n00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.040\nSo I came in and I just did a search for\nfile management and\n\n73\n00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.320\nI just did a look to see what\nfile managers are out there.\n\n74\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.315\nAnd, you will see some of them,\nlike commander one, that I've already got\n\n75\n00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:49.260\ninstalled; that's on that I used to use,\nbut then right here is Forklift.\n\n76\n00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.910\nNow, I never would have\nthought of Forklift.\n\n77\n00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.370\nI'm looking for a file manager.\n\n78\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.870\nNeither name is in that utility's name.\n\n79\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.090\nBut there it is.\n\n80\n00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.680\nAnd I can see that it's available,\nand it's free.\n\n81\n00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.390\nI can just download it.\n\n82\n00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.920\nI can click on Get, install the app,\nand it's going to install it.\n\n83\n00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.300\nIt asks for my Apple password, so I gotta\nprovide that, if I can remember it.\n\n84\n00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.520\nAnd then it will be able to download and\ninstall that app.\n\n85\n00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.140\nNow, I don't have to worry about, maybe I\ngot on to a false website or I'm getting\n\n86\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.410\nthis from a place where they might have\ninjected malware into the application.\n\n87\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.740\nI know that Apple reviewed this,\nthey approved it,\n\n88\n00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.400\nit's coming from their server,\nand it's safe.\n\n89\n00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.020\nI get it installed and\nnow it's ready to use.\n\n90\n00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.343\nI can just click open, it's gonna fire up,\nand now I'm in ForkLift, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:39.343 --> 00:04:43.260\nAnd [COUGH] I can start using\nthe application, it's ready to go.\n\n92\n00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.469\nIf I didn't launch it from the App Store,\n\n93\n00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:48.005\nI could've gone into my\nApplications folder.\n\n94\n00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:52.028\nAnd inside of my Applications folder,\n\n95\n00:04:52.028 --> 00:04:55.540\nForkLift shows up just like\nany other application.\n\n96\n00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.530\nSo I can find it right here.\n\n97\n00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.430\nHere's ForkLift and I can run that and\nnow I'm back in it.\n\n98\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.510\nEverything's nice and smooth, like that's\na very easy application experience.\n\n99\n00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.266\nSo that's a pretty straightforward example\nthere of how the App Store is nice.\n\n100\n00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:12.447\nNow that application, once it's installed,\n\n101\n00:05:12.447 --> 00:05:14.471\nI treat it just like\nany other application.\n\n102\n00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:18.820\nI can go and use it, but the cool\nthing here is, because I got it from\n\n103\n00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.270\nthe App Store, whenever there is\nan update, it can auto update.\n\n104\n00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.500\nIt's part of the auto\nupdate functionality.\n\n105\n00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.980\nIf you go into your System Preferences,\n\n106\n00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.780\ninside of your system preferences\nyou've got your App Store preferences.\n\n107\n00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.660\nAnd when you take a look inside of here,\nit's gonna tell you whether or\n\n108\n00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.870\nnot it's set up to install app updates.\n\n109\n00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.870\nMine is.\n\n110\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.370\nSo whenever an update for ForkLift is\nreleased, the App Store will see it,\n\n111\n00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.480\ndownload it, and install it.\n\n112\n00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.660\nNow that's not on by default,\nI turned that on in my laptop.\n\n113\n00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.630\nIf I turn that off, if an update comes\nout for ForkLift, it'll see it and\n\n114\n00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.643\nit'll notify me, but\nit won't actually do the install.\n\n115\n00:05:59.643 --> 00:06:03.098\nDown in my Dock, what would happen\nis that the App Store icon would get\n\n116\n00:06:03.098 --> 00:06:05.258\na little red circle with\na number one in it.\n\n117\n00:06:05.258 --> 00:06:07.600\nI mean, those one update or\nit might be five or six.\n\n118\n00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.140\nThere's five or six different updates.\n\n119\n00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.490\nBut it would notify me and then I can\ngo and update it with a click here.\n\n120\n00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.900\nAgain, not having to go\nto some vendor website,\n\n121\n00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.450\njust doing the update right from inside\nof the App Store is kind of a nice thing.\n\n122\n00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.860\nIn fact, you can see here one of\nmy apps has already got an update.\n\n123\n00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.880\nI have the Slack client installed,\nwhich is a communications tool.\n\n124\n00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.320\nAnd I didn't get that\nfrom the Slack website,\n\n125\n00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.420\nI got it from the Slack\napp here in the App Store.\n\n126\n00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.879\nSo now when there's an update available,\nit finds it and it can apply,\n\n127\n00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:38.397\nnow I just turned off my auto-update,\nso that's not automatic for me,\n\n128\n00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:40.436\nI would have to come in just click update.\n\n129\n00:06:40.436 --> 00:06:42.472\nAnd now it's gonna download and\nupdate that for me, and\n\n130\n00:06:42.472 --> 00:06:44.320\nmake sure I've got the newest version in.\n\n131\n00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.590\nBefore I forget, cuz I'm bad about this,\nI'm gonna turn my auto-update back on,\n\n132\n00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.674\nbecause, well, this is my actual\nlaptop and I do like the auto-update.\n\n133\n00:06:51.674 --> 00:06:53.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda nice feature.\n\n134\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.770\nNow getting the app\ninstalled was super easy.\n\n135\n00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.920\nIf I want to uninstall an app,\nlet's say I'm done with ForkLift.\n\n136\n00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.067\nI don't wanna use it anymore.\n\n137\n00:07:00.067 --> 00:07:04.790\nOkay, well, if I don't wanna use it,\nI can just go to my Application folder.\n\n138\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.750\nAnd just like any normal app I can\ntake ForkLift and I can just drag and\n\n139\n00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:15.550\ndrop that, and place it, whoops,\nif I can try and drag and drop that.\n\n140\n00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.370\nAnd place it in my Recycle Bin down here,\nin my trash.\n\n141\n00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.980\nAnd when I drop that in the trash,\nit's just gonna go and tell me that.\n\n142\n00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.070\nWell, I can't throw it away,\ncuz it's currently open.\n\n143\n00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.995\nI still have ForkLift open,\ncuz I accidentally double clicked on it.\n\n144\n00:07:29.995 --> 00:07:31.295\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me go and\n\n145\n00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:33.471\nwe'll get out of ForkLift first.\n\n146\n00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:36.110\nBut we basically just drag and\ndrop it to the trash.\n\n147\n00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.010\nAnd once we do that,\nI'm gonna keep opening this thing.\n\n148\n00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.615\n&gt;&gt; It likes you.\n\n149\n00:07:40.615 --> 00:07:42.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you,\n\n150\n00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.620\nthe magic touch pad is a thing\nthat is tough to get used to.\n\n151\n00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.240\nSo, I'm gonna drop that in my trash again.\n\n152\n00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.220\nThere we go.\n\n153\n00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.120\nNow, when I throw it away,\nnotice what it's doing here.\n\n154\n00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.580\nIt's telling me I've gotta\nbe an administrator.\n\n155\n00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.090\nTo take something out of the Applications\nfolder, I've gotta be an administrator.\n\n156\n00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.462\nIt's making sure that users\ncan't tamper with these files.\n\n157\n00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:02.007\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n158\n00:08:02.007 --> 00:08:05.307\n&gt;&gt; If users could tamper with it They\ncould maybe make a change to it,\n\n159\n00:08:05.307 --> 00:08:07.542\ninject malicious software, or whatever.\n\n160\n00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:11.845\nBut this is protected by the operating\nsystem because it came from the App Store.\n\n161\n00:08:11.845 --> 00:08:14.882\nAnd that's an important piece here,\nbecause it's again,\n\n162\n00:08:14.882 --> 00:08:16.557\nanother part of the protection.\n\n163\n00:08:16.557 --> 00:08:22.726\nSo all of those are reasons why this\nis the preferred method, right?\n\n164\n00:08:22.726 --> 00:08:25.838\nSo that's kind of a lot of the positive\nside of this, why Apple says,\n\n165\n00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:28.425\nhey, you should really install\napps from the App Store.\n\n166\n00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:31.405\nAnd most users will prefer it,\nif you can find them.\n\n167\n00:08:31.405 --> 00:08:33.432\nNot every app is in the App Store, but for\n\n168\n00:08:33.432 --> 00:08:36.537\nthe ones that are there this is\na great way to go in and get them.\n\n169\n00:08:36.537 --> 00:08:42.111\n&gt;&gt; I like the App Store too, but how do\nwe install apps without the App Store?\n\n170\n00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:46.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I just said all this\ngreat stuff about the App Store.\n\n171\n00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.985\nWhy would we even want to install\nsomething from outside of it, right?\n\n172\n00:08:49.985 --> 00:08:53.035\nWe can, it's acutally not hard,\ncuz we've been doing it for decades,\n\n173\n00:08:53.035 --> 00:08:54.737\ninstalling apps without the App Store.\n\n174\n00:08:54.737 --> 00:08:56.820\nThe App Store is a fairly\nrecent turn of events.\n\n175\n00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.228\nSo if we wanted to install\nsomething without the App Store,\n\n176\n00:09:00.228 --> 00:09:01.808\nwe certainly can, right?\n\n177\n00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:04.716\nBut they're encouraging us not to.\n\n178\n00:09:04.716 --> 00:09:07.657\nBut let me give you some examples\nwhere we'd still want to it this way.\n\n179\n00:09:07.657 --> 00:09:10.220\nOne, not every app is in the App Store.\n\n180\n00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.067\nIn fact, a lot of free software\nis not in the App Store.\n\n181\n00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:16.869\nBecause Apple has certain\nrequirements they place on software.\n\n182\n00:09:16.869 --> 00:09:18.924\nApple, they kinda wanna make money.\n\n183\n00:09:18.924 --> 00:09:23.188\nSo most of the applications you're gonna\nfind in the App Store are once that\n\n184\n00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:28.070\nare either paid applications or\nthey're free with in-app purchases.\n\n185\n00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.499\nYou'll find a far smaller sample of\napplications that are in the App Store\n\n186\n00:09:32.499 --> 00:09:33.795\nthat are truly free.\n\n187\n00:09:33.795 --> 00:09:36.343\nAnd that's because the truly free\nproducts that are out there,\n\n188\n00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:38.812\nthe open-source type products,\nthey don't have a budget.\n\n189\n00:09:38.812 --> 00:09:41.661\nThey don't have an ad revenue or\nanything like that.\n\n190\n00:09:41.661 --> 00:09:44.527\nAnd so when they put something in\nthe App Store, it takes work for\n\n191\n00:09:44.527 --> 00:09:46.611\nthem to maintain that\napp developer account.\n\n192\n00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:49.308\nTo get everything digitally signed\nthe way that Apple requires it,\n\n193\n00:09:49.308 --> 00:09:51.545\nto go through the approval process,\nthat costs money.\n\n194\n00:09:51.545 --> 00:09:55.260\nAnd so there's some apps that\ndon't make it in the Apps Store.\n\n195\n00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.117\nThe other reason is that\nthe App Store puts certain\n\n196\n00:09:58.117 --> 00:10:00.030\nsecurity limitation on the app.\n\n197\n00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.098\nWhich I've just talked about all\nthe positive sides of, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:03.098 --> 00:10:06.099\nWell, there's actually some\nnegative sides to it too.\n\n199\n00:10:06.099 --> 00:10:08.559\nForkLift is a good example,\nI'm gonna go back to ForkLift.\n\n200\n00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:11.741\nI'm gonna pull up its page.\n\n201\n00:10:11.741 --> 00:10:15.458\nForkLift, well with any\napplication in the App Store,\n\n202\n00:10:15.458 --> 00:10:19.820\nwhen you install it,\nit's installed in whats called a Sandbox.\n\n203\n00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.476\nThe Sandbox is like a border\nthat's put around the app and\n\n204\n00:10:24.476 --> 00:10:30.111\nit says this app is not allowed to\ntouch any other apps files, right?\n\n205\n00:10:30.111 --> 00:10:32.590\nIt keeps the applications separated.\n\n206\n00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.872\nAnd that way, if one application does go\nrogue, does somehow become malicious,\n\n207\n00:10:36.872 --> 00:10:39.056\nit can't affect any other application.\n\n208\n00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:41.569\nIt's a protection mechanism.\n\n209\n00:10:41.569 --> 00:10:46.813\nBut that can break functionality in some\napplications, and ForkLift is an example.\n\n210\n00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.825\nIf I expand out the description\nhere of ForkLift.\n\n211\n00:10:49.825 --> 00:10:55.401\nIt tells me Note, App Store versions\ndo not contain the Disklet feature and\n\n212\n00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:58.863\ncannot perform privileged file operations.\n\n213\n00:10:58.863 --> 00:10:59.677\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n214\n00:10:59.677 --> 00:11:03.760\n&gt;&gt; All right, and what that means\nis privileged file operations.\n\n215\n00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.299\nThe ability to delete things that you'd\nnormally have to be route to do or\n\n216\n00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:10.968\nan administrator to do, when you're\nin the Sandbox, you can't do that.\n\n217\n00:11:10.968 --> 00:11:16.731\nAnd the Disklette feature, that allows\nyou to mount virtual disks as volumes.\n\n218\n00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:20.489\nAgain, you need to be an administrator for\nthat, and that is not allowed for\n\n219\n00:11:20.489 --> 00:11:23.088\nan app in the App Store,\nthe Sandbox prevents that.\n\n220\n00:11:23.088 --> 00:11:24.914\nSo the authors of\nthe software are warning you.\n\n221\n00:11:24.914 --> 00:11:29.618\nThey're saying right here, hey, look,\nForkLift can do a lot of great stuff.\n\n222\n00:11:29.618 --> 00:11:32.377\nIf you install it, you'll be able\nto do all of these things here.\n\n223\n00:11:32.377 --> 00:11:35.416\nAnd it's a great big list, and\nit's a ton of features and\n\n224\n00:11:35.416 --> 00:11:37.450\nfunctionality that I'm a big fan of.\n\n225\n00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.617\nBut if you want the privileged file\noperations or if you want the discount\n\n226\n00:11:41.617 --> 00:11:45.391\nfeature, you're not gonna be able\nto do that with this version.\n\n227\n00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:50.971\nAnd so in that scenario, you're better\noff going to the vendor's website.\n\n228\n00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:53.566\nAnd ForkLift is by a company\ncalled BinaryNights.\n\n229\n00:11:53.566 --> 00:12:00.221\nAnd if you go to their website,\nyou can Download or Buy the application.\n\n230\n00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:02.271\nAnd when you go to Buy it here,\n\n231\n00:12:02.271 --> 00:12:06.553\nyou're getting not the App Store\nversion but their version.\n\n232\n00:12:06.553 --> 00:12:09.565\nTheir version which can do\nadministration activities,\n\n233\n00:12:09.565 --> 00:12:11.640\nit does come with the Disklet feature.\n\n234\n00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.758\n&gt;&gt; I see.\n&gt;&gt; We get more, right?\n\n235\n00:12:13.758 --> 00:12:15.325\nBut we also get risk, right?\n\n236\n00:12:15.325 --> 00:12:17.300\nWell, what's the risk here?\n\n237\n00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.040\nDid I make it to the right website?\n\n238\n00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.718\nThe product's called ForkLift 3,\nthe company is called BinaryNights,\n\n239\n00:12:21.718 --> 00:12:23.341\nit's like two completely different names.\n\n240\n00:12:23.341 --> 00:12:26.896\nSo how do I know I'm at\nthe actual ForkLift 3 site?\n\n241\n00:12:26.896 --> 00:12:30.018\nWell, one way is I could have\nused the link in the App Store.\n\n242\n00:12:30.018 --> 00:12:34.005\nThe App Store has the link to whoever the\ndeveloper is, see here the BinaryNights\n\n243\n00:12:34.005 --> 00:12:37.007\nwebsite, that will make sure\nthat I knew I got the right one.\n\n244\n00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:41.928\nBut I will need to verify that the website\nwas the one that I intended to get to,\n\n245\n00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:42.940\nright?\n\n246\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.484\nThe second thing is just because it's\nthe website I intended to get to,\n\n247\n00:12:46.484 --> 00:12:49.687\nhow do I know the file I'm about\nto download is not compromised?\n\n248\n00:12:49.687 --> 00:12:54.463\nThat it has a become a prevalent type\nof attack where hackers will try and\n\n249\n00:12:54.463 --> 00:12:59.415\nbreak in to where these files are stored\nand inject malware into the file.\n\n250\n00:12:59.415 --> 00:13:03.065\nSo that when you download it,\nit's already got malware inside of it.\n\n251\n00:13:03.065 --> 00:13:05.106\nSo that could be a problem.\n\n252\n00:13:05.106 --> 00:13:08.566\nWhen I download this, I need to have\na reasonable degree of trust in the source\n\n253\n00:13:08.566 --> 00:13:09.906\nthat I'm getting this from.\n\n254\n00:13:09.906 --> 00:13:13.260\nI have that trust with the App Store,\nI don't have it necessarily here.\n\n255\n00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.681\nNow, I've used this product for\nyears and years.\n\n256\n00:13:15.681 --> 00:13:18.154\nSo I do trust the website and\nI do know it's the right one.\n\n257\n00:13:18.154 --> 00:13:21.599\nSo if we know all that,\nwe can Download the file.\n\n258\n00:13:21.599 --> 00:13:24.373\nNow most Mac apps when you\ndownload them from the App Store,\n\n259\n00:13:24.373 --> 00:13:27.107\nthey show up in your application\nfolder and you're done.\n\n260\n00:13:27.107 --> 00:13:29.720\nBut when you download them this way,\n\n261\n00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.613\nthey come down usually as a DMG file or\ndisk image file.\n\n262\n00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:35.601\nAnd that file contains the application,\nbut\n\n263\n00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:38.436\nit's not allowed to drop it right\ninto the application folder.\n\n264\n00:13:38.436 --> 00:13:40.408\nWe're gonna have to do that ourselves.\n\n265\n00:13:40.408 --> 00:13:42.605\nSo my download just finished, and\n\n266\n00:13:42.605 --> 00:13:46.769\nI can see that, this one actually\ndidn't come down as the DMG,\n\n267\n00:13:46.769 --> 00:13:52.252\nit came down as the actual application, or\nactually did I downloaded more than once?\n\n268\n00:13:52.252 --> 00:13:53.009\nI think I did.\n\n269\n00:13:53.009 --> 00:13:55.030\nSo [COUGH] I've downloaded\nit more than once.\n\n270\n00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.525\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me go into my Downloads folder\n\n271\n00:13:57.525 --> 00:14:01.034\nhere, and\nwe're gonna take a look at those files.\n\n272\n00:14:01.034 --> 00:14:04.330\nSo what I've got here are two\ndifferent versions of ForkLift.\n\n273\n00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.079\nOne of them is a ZIP file that\nI must have downloaded earlier.\n\n274\n00:14:08.079 --> 00:14:10.145\nAnd here's the one I just download.\n\n275\n00:14:10.145 --> 00:14:13.890\nAnd it's showing as ForkLift,\nit's the application.\n\n276\n00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.964\nAnd I know the difference.\n\n277\n00:14:15.964 --> 00:14:18.564\nThe first one,\nI actually downloaded with Google Chrome.\n\n278\n00:14:18.564 --> 00:14:22.656\nAnd when Chrome downloads an application\nin a ZIP, they just leave it as the ZIP.\n\n279\n00:14:22.656 --> 00:14:24.681\nThe first one here I\ndownloaded with Safari.\n\n280\n00:14:24.681 --> 00:14:28.605\nAnd Safari said, this is an application\nthat's zipped, and it unarchived it for\n\n281\n00:14:28.605 --> 00:14:31.043\nme and dropped it there,\nso that's the difference.\n\n282\n00:14:31.043 --> 00:14:35.088\nBut I've got that application,\nit's sitting right there,\n\n283\n00:14:35.088 --> 00:14:36.734\nand I can now install it.\n\n284\n00:14:36.734 --> 00:14:40.036\nTechnically, I could run it right\nhere from the Downloads folder.\n\n285\n00:14:40.036 --> 00:14:43.930\nBut the Downloads folder is just for\nme, just for my user.\n\n286\n00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.978\nIf I want this to be available for\nmore than one user,\n\n287\n00:14:45.978 --> 00:14:47.669\nI need to get it in my\nApplications folder.\n\n288\n00:14:47.669 --> 00:14:51.228\nSo we can just drag that and\ndrop that, we can try and drag it and\n\n289\n00:14:51.228 --> 00:14:54.329\ndrop it right into our\nApplications folder, right?\n\n290\n00:14:54.329 --> 00:15:00.618\nAnd that's gonna drop it in there and I'll\nnow have a ForkLift application, okay?\n\n291\n00:15:00.618 --> 00:15:03.714\nNow couple of interesting things\nthat can happen here that are again,\n\n292\n00:15:03.714 --> 00:15:05.088\ndifferent than the App Store.\n\n293\n00:15:05.088 --> 00:15:09.216\nFirst off,\nthe first time I run this application,\n\n294\n00:15:09.216 --> 00:15:12.864\nthe system might not\ntrust the application.\n\n295\n00:15:12.864 --> 00:15:16.569\nIt does trust that when it comes in the\nApp Store because it knows it’s okay but\n\n296\n00:15:16.569 --> 00:15:19.368\nwhen I run this the first time,\nit’s giving me a warning.\n\n297\n00:15:19.368 --> 00:15:23.775\nIt says ForkLift is an application\ndownloaded from the Internet,\n\n298\n00:15:23.775 --> 00:15:25.906\nare you sure you want to open it?\n\n299\n00:15:25.906 --> 00:15:27.489\nThere’s my warning and\n\n300\n00:15:27.489 --> 00:15:33.356\nit’s telling me Safari downloaded it from\nbinarynights.com, are you sure, right?\n\n301\n00:15:33.356 --> 00:15:36.247\nIf you're not sure, if you don't\nknow where this program came from,\n\n302\n00:15:36.247 --> 00:15:36.936\nyou can cancel.\n\n303\n00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.052\nIt stops it from running,\n\n304\n00:15:38.052 --> 00:15:41.263\nyou don't have to worry about malware\ninfecting your system and all that.\n\n305\n00:15:41.263 --> 00:15:45.171\nBut if you are sure it's the right one,\nyou click Open and you get in there.\n\n306\n00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:50.129\nNow, I'm gonna cancel that, because\nthe other thing I wanna highlight are how\n\n307\n00:15:50.129 --> 00:15:54.277\nthese permissions are getting set and\nwhere this file is going to.\n\n308\n00:15:54.277 --> 00:15:57.318\nThere's actually more than\none Application folder.\n\n309\n00:15:57.318 --> 00:16:03.870\nSo on the Application side, on the Finder,\nI just use one Application folder.\n\n310\n00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:07.151\nBut there's actually two application\nfolders that affect most users.\n\n311\n00:16:07.151 --> 00:16:10.960\nIf I drop to my terminal, I'll be able\nto show you this a little better.\n\n312\n00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:18.700\nSo the main application is in\n/Applications, that folder right there.\n\n313\n00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.810\nIf you look on your hard\ndrive in /Applications and\n\n314\n00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.780\npoke around you should find most of the\napplications that you've got installed.\n\n315\n00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.330\nI can see Forklift.app right there.\n\n316\n00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.090\nOkay, so\nthere's the application that I installed.\n\n317\n00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.830\nAt the same time though,\n\n318\n00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:37.500\nthere is another application folder\nin my Home directory, all right?\n\n319\n00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:44.910\nSo if I were to look in\n/users/dpezet/applications,\n\n320\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.220\nthere's another folder, right?\n\n321\n00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.920\nI could have put the Forklift\napp in either folder.\n\n322\n00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.830\nIf I put it in the applications\nfolder in my home directory,\n\n323\n00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.730\nthe application would\njust be available for me.\n\n324\n00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.870\nAny other user on this computer\nwouldn't see the application.\n\n325\n00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.440\nBut if I want it available for everybody,\n\n326\n00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.760\nthen I would put it in\nthe /Applications folder.\n\n327\n00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.330\nNow it's available globally, right?\n\n328\n00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.740\nThe key difference there is\njust who has access to it.\n\n329\n00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.570\nThe application itself still\nhas its own permissions.\n\n330\n00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:16.830\nWhen an app installs from the App Store\nthe system knows it can trust it and\n\n331\n00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:19.320\nit gives it more permissions.\n\n332\n00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:24.740\nFor an app that is installed from a third\nparty, it doesn't trust it as much.\n\n333\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.620\nAnd we can see that in\nthe main applications folder.\n\n334\n00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:31.215\nLet's compare Forklift with Pixelmator.\n\n335\n00:17:31.215 --> 00:17:33.130\nPixelmator is a graphics heading software.\n\n336\n00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.500\nIt's kinda like a smaller\nversion of Photoshop.\n\n337\n00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.910\nI installed it from the app store.\n\n338\n00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:43.725\nSo I'll do an LS-L to get the long\nlisting of the directory here.\n\n339\n00:17:43.725 --> 00:17:46.840\n[COUGH] And I come in and I find Forklift.\n\n340\n00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.090\nForklift is right here,\nand see who it's owned by?\n\n341\n00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.080\nIt's owned by D Pezet,\nit's owned by me, right?\n\n342\n00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.550\nI'm the one who put it there.\n\n343\n00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.670\nWhich means I'm the one who\ncan modify it if I want to.\n\n344\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.820\nI'm the owner,\nI can do whatever I want to this file.\n\n345\n00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:06.050\nI can modify it in bad ways,\ngood ways, I can do anything to it.\n\n346\n00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.730\nThe system doesn't really know where\nit came from in the beginning so\n\n347\n00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.380\nit's giving it my authority because\nI'm the one who installed it.\n\n348\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.630\nBut let's find Pixelmator in this list.\n\n349\n00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.930\nAnd when I find Pixelmator, here it is.\n\n350\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:22.680\nAnd look who owns that one, Root, okay?\n\n351\n00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.153\nThis came from the App Store.\n\n352\n00:18:24.153 --> 00:18:26.800\nThe system knows that it can be trusted.\n\n353\n00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:32.400\nAnd it knows that it's gonna be in\na sandbox, and so the system puts\n\n354\n00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.480\na higher level of privilege on it,\nit's owned by root, it's not owned by me.\n\n355\n00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.318\nAnd so if I try to modify this\nfile I'm gonna be stopped.\n\n356\n00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:41.616\nI can't modify because I'm not root.\n\n357\n00:18:41.616 --> 00:18:43.550\nI would have to override\nthat privilege to do it.\n\n358\n00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.770\nAnd the moment that I do that\n\n359\n00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.050\nthen it's no longer really\na trusted app at that point, right?\n\n360\n00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:51.500\nSo that's kind of an interested thing and\n\n361\n00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.880\nwhen you look at the permissions on here\nyou can kind of get it quick high level\n\n362\n00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.920\nview of apps that I installed from\nthe App Store versus ones that I didn't.\n\n363\n00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.695\nSo, for example, you can see FileZilla\nhere, or Gas Mask, Google Chrome,\n\n364\n00:19:02.695 --> 00:19:07.275\nRu-Pad, those are all programs\nI installed from the web.\n\n365\n00:19:07.275 --> 00:19:11.825\nAnd then you can see programs like Entropy\nthat I installed from the App Store.\n\n366\n00:19:11.825 --> 00:19:16.415\nI can tell just based on who the owner is,\nwhether it's Root or whether it's me, and\n\n367\n00:19:16.415 --> 00:19:22.770\nthat's all about putting the boundaries in\nto protect us from modified applications.\n\n368\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.120\n&gt;&gt; Well do we still have to\nworry about malicious software?\n\n369\n00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.790\nI know you kinda touched on that earlier.\n\n370\n00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so all of these\nare different protections, right?\n\n371\n00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.320\nAnd in theory you could look at it and\nsay nah,\n\n372\n00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.780\nwe don't have to worry\nabout it we're safe, right?\n\n373\n00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.930\nBut that's not true.\n\n374\n00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.539\nSo right now I installed Forklift and\n\n375\n00:19:39.539 --> 00:19:43.760\nForklift is installed with\nme as the owner, right?\n\n376\n00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.090\nAnd I know it's safe.\n\n377\n00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.710\nIt's in there, I put it in the system,\nI approved it.\n\n378\n00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:51.970\nBut what if I really want to be tricky,\nand I go in and\n\n379\n00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:53.900\nI start modifying Forklift?\n\n380\n00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.320\nAnd I set it so that when it runs,\nit also runs a key logger so\n\n381\n00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.200\nthat I can log people's information.\n\n382\n00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.544\nIt's in the applications folder,\n\n383\n00:20:00.544 --> 00:20:02.349\nso anybody who uses this\ncomputer could use it.\n\n384\n00:20:02.349 --> 00:20:05.849\nThey fire up Forklift thinking it's\ntrustworthy and now a key logger is\n\n385\n00:20:05.849 --> 00:20:09.368\nrunning while they're logged in and\nthey don't even know it, right?\n\n386\n00:20:09.368 --> 00:20:12.444\nSo, while I might have been safe\nfrom certain attack vectors,\n\n387\n00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:14.370\nthere's other ones that still exist.\n\n388\n00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.870\nSo we still need to worry about malware.\n\n389\n00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:20.350\nAnd the best way to protect against\nmalware is to make sure you're doing your\n\n390\n00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:21.080\nApple updates.\n\n391\n00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.700\nIf you're updating your system, as soon as\nApple finds out about an attack like this\n\n392\n00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.860\nthey push a fix out to take care of it.\n\n393\n00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.435\nBut there is another thing we can do.\n\n394\n00:20:29.435 --> 00:20:33.500\nThe system has a feature\ncalled Gatekeeper.\n\n395\n00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.630\nGatekeeper is a part of macOS,\nit was introduced quite some time ago.\n\n396\n00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.120\nAnd when I ran Forklift that first time,\nremember the warning that I got?\n\n397\n00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.710\nWhere did my window go?\n\n398\n00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:46.390\nI'm gonna get back into my\napplications folder here.\n\n399\n00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:47.230\nI got too much stuff open.\n\n400\n00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:51.200\nI'm gonna find Forklift and\nI'm gonna run it.\n\n401\n00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.890\nAnd when I ran it I got a warning\nthat popped up, this warning, okay?\n\n402\n00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:59.550\nNow it doesn't say it anywhere here,\nbut this is Gatekeeper.\n\n403\n00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.550\nIt's Gatekeeper saying,\nare you sure you wanna run this?\n\n404\n00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.290\nAre you absolutely sure this\nis what you want to do?\n\n405\n00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.140\nAnd if you are, you can say open.\n\n406\n00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.010\nNow, I can say open because\nI'm an administrator, right?\n\n407\n00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.660\nBecause I have that privilege.\n\n408\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.730\nIf you're a regular user, you may or\nmay not have that privilege.\n\n409\n00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.880\nIt depends on how\nGatekeeper is configured.\n\n410\n00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.010\nSo if you're really worried about this,\nyou can disable this functionality.\n\n411\n00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:26.530\nYou can make it where your system will\nonly allow apps from the App Store.\n\n412\n00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.070\nLet me show you how that works.\n\n413\n00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:32.830\nIf we go into System Preferences, and\ninside of System Preferences we can go to\n\n414\n00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:38.220\nSecurity &amp; Privacy, and inside of\nSecurity &amp; Privacy, on the General tab.\n\n415\n00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.670\nThere's a little option right\ndown here at the bottom and\n\n416\n00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:44.800\nit says, allow apps downloaded from,\nand I can pick.\n\n417\n00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:51.230\nThe default is that we allow apps from the\nApp Store and identified developers, okay?\n\n418\n00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:54.260\nThat means it can be an app\nfrom a third party site\n\n419\n00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.870\nas long as the developer's registered\nwith the Apple Developer Program and\n\n420\n00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:01.010\nthey have a digital certificate that\nthey use to sign this application to\n\n421\n00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.680\nprove that they're the ones who wrote it.\n\n422\n00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.750\nIf it's an application that\nis not digitally signed,\n\n423\n00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.880\nit will not be allowed to run no matter\nwhat, right, that's the default.\n\n424\n00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:17.950\nBut I can even go tighter and say I just\nwant to allow App Store applications.\n\n425\n00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.650\nLet me just unlock this screen here.\n\n426\n00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.915\nAnd I think I typed my password wrong,\nand I did.\n\n427\n00:22:23.915 --> 00:22:26.690\nThis is the problem with\na complex password.\n\n428\n00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:27.590\nAnd there we go.\n\n429\n00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.130\nAnd so now I can change it and\nsay, you know what,\n\n430\n00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.730\nI'm only going to allow apps\ndownloaded from the App Store.\n\n431\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.800\nI don't care if they're\ndigitally signed or not,\n\n432\n00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.190\nyou've got to get it from the App Store.\n\n433\n00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:41.260\nAnd when I do that, now my laptop\nbecomes more like an iPad or an iPhone.\n\n434\n00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.440\nYou can only get apps from the App Store,\n\n435\n00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:46.310\nit wont let you side load, and\nthat's kinda where we're tied to.\n\n436\n00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.840\nNow, most people are not\nready to go to that level.\n\n437\n00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.090\nBecause there's still so\n\n438\n00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.830\nmany applications that are available\noutside of the App Store.\n\n439\n00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.040\nApple themselves have admitted that their\nApp Store has not grown the way that they\n\n440\n00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.110\nhoped it would.\n\n441\n00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.100\nThat if you compare this\nto the iOS App Store,\n\n442\n00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.600\nthe iOS App Store has millions of apps,\ntons of really great stuff.\n\n443\n00:23:05.762 --> 00:23:11.600\nThe macOS App Store on the other hand,\nit's not, it doesn't have as much stuff.\n\n444\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.040\nIt hasn't broken a million definitely.\n\n445\n00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.804\nAnd a lot of the apps get abandoned and\noutdated, or\n\n446\n00:23:16.804 --> 00:23:21.242\nthey have problems like the ForkLift app\nwhere I’m basically encouraged to go and\n\n447\n00:23:21.242 --> 00:23:24.348\nget it from the third party\ninstead of from the App Store.\n\n448\n00:23:24.348 --> 00:23:29.192\nSo, there’s a lot of things holding back\nthis App Store, so most of us aren’t quite\n\n449\n00:23:29.192 --> 00:23:33.380\nready to make that jump and say hey,\nI’m just going to do App Store apps.\n\n450\n00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:37.660\nOne day that might change, and it hasn’t\nhappened as of this episode being filmed,\n\n451\n00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.860\nbut maybe by the time you watch this,\nApple is about to release a beta where\n\n452\n00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:47.070\nyou'll be able to run iPad apps on macOS.\n\n453\n00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:49.760\nAnd so when that happens,\nthey'll connect the two app stores.\n\n454\n00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.495\nAnd you'll start seeing\nnative macOS apps and\n\n455\n00:23:52.495 --> 00:23:56.540\niOS apps that are iPad-enabled\nall available in one place.\n\n456\n00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.421\nThat will change the App Store a good bit.\n\n457\n00:23:58.421 --> 00:24:02.113\nNow we'll have a lot more functionality\nand applications in there.\n\n458\n00:24:02.113 --> 00:24:04.707\nThat'll be a big deal, all right,\nbut that hasn't happened yet.\n\n459\n00:24:04.707 --> 00:24:06.829\nSo for right now,\nthose are the two options.\n\n460\n00:24:06.829 --> 00:24:09.681\nWe pretty much just get\nto work between those.\n\n461\n00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:13.289\nAnd once we've got that sorted out as\nlong as it's an application that we've\n\n462\n00:24:13.289 --> 00:24:16.060\napproved, we can come in and\nwe can launch it.\n\n463\n00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.960\nAnd I'll see that little warning\nbox will come up I can choose Open.\n\n464\n00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.951\nAnd now, forklift is going to launch,\napparently in my background,\n\n465\n00:24:23.951 --> 00:24:26.670\ncuz I've clicked too many things,\nhere we go.\n\n466\n00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.230\nIt's gonna launch, and here we go.\n\n467\n00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:34.190\nNow, it's prompting me for a license,\nbecause forklift isn't free, right?\n\n468\n00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.450\nSo I can continue a trial or\nI can buy it from that developer.\n\n469\n00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:42.300\nNow there's risk here, again, risk because\nI'm buying directly from the developer.\n\n470\n00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.790\nIf I get it from the app store,\nit's just an in app purchase.\n\n471\n00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.760\nI'm technically buying it from Apple.\n\n472\n00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.730\nSo something goes wrong,\nI know I can get a refund through Apple.\n\n473\n00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.210\nI don't know if I can get\na refund from the vendor, right?\n\n474\n00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:57.760\nAnd with Apple, they'll allow me to\ninstall on five or six machines.\n\n475\n00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.790\nAnd I can always reinstall\nif I get a new machine.\n\n476\n00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.010\nWith the vendor,\n\n477\n00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.820\nI don't know how many times I'll\nbe able to use this license key.\n\n478\n00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.770\nSo that's another reason we might\nchoose to go with the App Store version\n\n479\n00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:11.100\nversus the version\ndirectly from the vendor.\n\n480\n00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:11.760\nOther times,\n\n481\n00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.280\nit's actually cheaper to buy directly\nfrom the vendor than it is from Apple.\n\n482\n00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.710\nSo it's a bit of a mixed bag on this one,\nwhich way you wanna go.\n\n483\n00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:20.270\nBut at this point,\n\n484\n00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.005\nI would need to paste in my key,\nwhich I'm not gonna do on camera.\n\n485\n00:25:24.005 --> 00:25:26.567\n[LAUGH] I don't feel like\nsharing my key today.\n\n486\n00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:29.296\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But hey, maybe that's another benefit\n\n487\n00:25:29.296 --> 00:25:33.370\nof the App Store, and if I was in the App\nStore, I would just hit restore purchases.\n\n488\n00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:34.604\nI wouldn't have to type in a key.\n\n489\n00:25:34.604 --> 00:25:35.190\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n490\n00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.380\nI would already have my commercial\nsoftware loaded back up.\n\n491\n00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.839\n&gt;&gt; So are there any other types\nof apps available on macOS,\n\n492\n00:25:41.839 --> 00:25:43.307\n[CROSSTALK] to be aware?\n\n493\n00:25:43.307 --> 00:25:45.760\n&gt;&gt; Those are the main ones.\n\n494\n00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.828\nThere is one other thing that,\na lot of people forget these are apps, but\n\n495\n00:25:48.828 --> 00:25:49.950\nit's kind of important.\n\n496\n00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:54.650\nThis is my actual laptop, and so\nI've changed my dock and what's down here.\n\n497\n00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.970\nBut when you get a brand new Mac or\n\n498\n00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:02.610\na fresh install of macOS, There will be\nan icon down here for Mission Control.\n\n499\n00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.666\nMission Control,\nyou can access even without the icon.\n\n500\n00:26:05.666 --> 00:26:12.790\nIf you just do a three fingered swipe up\non your keyboard, or on your touchpad.\n\n501\n00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.170\nSo I just did a three finger swipe up.\n\n502\n00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.850\nI think Ctrl+Up Arrow, is that?\n\n503\n00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.150\nYeah, Ctrl+Up Arrow does it as well.\n\n504\n00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.190\nThere's a few different ways\nto get to Mission Control.\n\n505\n00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:23.280\nMost of you will actually have an icon for\nit down in your doc,\n\n506\n00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.090\nunless you've removed it like I have.\n\n507\n00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.388\nI don't use Mission Control ever, really.\n\n508\n00:26:28.388 --> 00:26:31.120\nSo I'm not the biggest fan of it,\nthat's why I've removed the icon.\n\n509\n00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.906\nBut the main purpose of Mission Control is\nto show us what applications are running.\n\n510\n00:26:35.906 --> 00:26:37.510\nYou make it easy to switch between them.\n\n511\n00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.570\nAnd if you've got multiple\nvirtual desktops up here\n\n512\n00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:45.300\nthat you could move one application\nto one desktop versus another.\n\n513\n00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.550\nAnd now, I could three finger swipe\nleft and right to move between them.\n\n514\n00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.630\nThat's a main purpose of mission control,\nright?\n\n515\n00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:55.430\nBut there's another feature that\nsome of you might be used to\n\n516\n00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:59.810\nespecially if you upgraded from older\nversions of macOS called the Dashboard.\n\n517\n00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:04.619\nAnd my Dashboard is turned off, so\nlet me, which I'll clarify that,\n\n518\n00:27:04.619 --> 00:27:06.665\nstarting with macOS Sierra.\n\n519\n00:27:06.665 --> 00:27:11.710\nIf you are fresh in solid macOS Sierra,\nthe Dashboard will be disabled by default.\n\n520\n00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.800\nMine is disabled because\nI did a fresh install.\n\n521\n00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.370\nIf you've upgraded though your Dashboard\nmay still be on, and the reason I'm\n\n522\n00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:20.895\nharping about this Dashboard is\nthe Dashboard has little widgets on it.\n\n523\n00:27:20.895 --> 00:27:21.470\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n524\n00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:25.310\nthose widgets are technically\napplications, they're programs, they run,\n\n525\n00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.520\nthey do stuff.\n\n526\n00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.690\nWell, the Dashboard is off\ndefault starting with Sierra so\n\n527\n00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:32.240\nthose applications don't run I\ndon't have to worry about them.\n\n528\n00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.510\nI don't think many people use them.\n\n529\n00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:38.360\nBut you might be yelling at your TV\nright now, saying I love the Dashboard.\n\n530\n00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.148\nDon you're an idiot,\nthis is a great feature.\n\n531\n00:27:40.148 --> 00:27:40.671\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And hey,\n\n532\n00:27:40.671 --> 00:27:42.496\nno big deal everybody has different needs.\n\n533\n00:27:42.496 --> 00:27:43.560\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n534\n00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.210\n&gt;&gt; But we need to remember\nthose are applications.\n\n535\n00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.470\nSo let me show you that real quick.\n\n536\n00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.150\nI do need to go into my preferences\nthough, and turn that back on.\n\n537\n00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:53.523\nIn your system preferences you've\ngot a Mission Control preference.\n\n538\n00:27:53.523 --> 00:27:58.330\nAnd in here, you'll see where it's\ngot this option, Dashboard off.\n\n539\n00:27:58.330 --> 00:27:59.710\nI didn't turn that off.\n\n540\n00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.032\nThis is macOS High Sierra, but in Sierra,\n\n541\n00:28:02.032 --> 00:28:06.060\nstarting 10.12 it's off by\ndefault unless you upgrade it.\n\n542\n00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:10.450\nI'm gonna turn that on, and you can\nturn it on as space, or as a overlay.\n\n543\n00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:12.770\nOverlay means it sits\non top of your desktop.\n\n544\n00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.990\nThe default in previous versions\nwas that it was a space.\n\n545\n00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:20.140\nAnd by a space, it shows up as\nanother virtual desktop, okay?\n\n546\n00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.910\nSo I'm gonna set that.\n\n547\n00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:25.010\nAnd a moment ago,\nwhen I launched mission control,\n\n548\n00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:29.116\nwhen I did my, oops, three fingers swipe.\n\n549\n00:28:29.116 --> 00:28:30.360\nThere we go.\n\n550\n00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.233\nWhat I saw up top was, wonderful desktop.\n\n551\n00:28:34.233 --> 00:28:35.910\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And I added a second, but\n\n552\n00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:37.390\nsee I don't have a dashboard now.\n\n553\n00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Once the dashboard is on, by default,\n\n554\n00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.140\nit is just the left most virtual desktop.\n\n555\n00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.370\nAnd if I come over here,\nhere's some widgets.\n\n556\n00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:46.800\nHere's a calculator widget, right?\n\n557\n00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.810\nVery, very exciting.\n\n558\n00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.516\nIf I want to know, in a hurry,\nwhat 2 plus 2 is, and\n\n559\n00:28:50.516 --> 00:28:54.656\nI can't be bothered to launch the actual\ncalculator, I've got it right here.\n\n560\n00:28:54.656 --> 00:28:55.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a tough one.\n\n561\n00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.310\n&gt;&gt; The weather,\nI can spot the weather, very exciting.\n\n562\n00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:04.280\nI got a clock, because the clock on\nmy menu bar isn't good enough, and\n\n563\n00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.889\nI've got a calendar.\n\n564\n00:29:05.889 --> 00:29:07.932\nCouple of different applications,\nI make fun of it, right?\n\n565\n00:29:07.932 --> 00:29:12.080\nBut there's a lot more, if we use the\nlittle plus minus down here at the bottom.\n\n566\n00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.660\nI can add more widgets, all right.\n\n567\n00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.792\nThese are all the official\nApple supported widgets.\n\n568\n00:29:17.792 --> 00:29:18.750\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n569\n00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.760\n&gt;&gt; But there's companies that\nmake third-party widgets.\n\n570\n00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.400\nYou can install all sorts of crazy things\nhere to run as a Dashboard widget, and\n\n571\n00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.270\nthey do run.\n\n572\n00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:28.130\nThey are programs, they're applications.\n\n573\n00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:31.380\nSo you might have instances,\nwhere you've installed an application, and\n\n574\n00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.600\nyou don't see an icon for it.\n\n575\n00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.310\nYou don't see the program in\nthe applications folder and\n\n576\n00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.360\nit actually turns out to\nbe a Dashboard widget.\n\n577\n00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.997\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So I wanted to highlight that, again,\n\n578\n00:29:39.997 --> 00:29:44.928\nnot the most common thing on the planet,\nnot, I don't think a ton of people use\n\n579\n00:29:44.928 --> 00:29:48.450\nthis stuff\n&gt;&gt; But I can throw in the movie widget,\n\n580\n00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:53.000\nnow I can see all these great\nmovies which is often a tangent but\n\n581\n00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.752\nI'm almost done reading\nthe annihilation book.\n\n582\n00:29:54.752 --> 00:29:56.833\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is terrible.\n\n583\n00:29:56.833 --> 00:29:58.820\nAny how, so [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n584\n00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.170\nyou're going to finish it aren't you?\n\n585\n00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:02.570\nYou've got to finish it.\n\n586\n00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:04.743\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I only got like 50 pages,\nI've got to stick it through.\n\n587\n00:30:04.743 --> 00:30:06.278\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's tough,\n\n588\n00:30:06.278 --> 00:30:10.130\n[COUGH] So that's what the dashboard\ncan do, those are applications.\n\n589\n00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.020\nI personally don't use that feature, so\nI'm gonna go and turn it back off again,\n\n590\n00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.170\nbut I just wanted you guys to be aware.\n\n591\n00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:19.420\nSo the primary sources of applications\nis going to be the Apple App Store.\n\n592\n00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.590\nAfter that,\nyou can go to third party websites and\n\n593\n00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:22.930\ndownload applications that way.\n\n594\n00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:25.315\nPerfectly fine, and lots of people do it.\n\n595\n00:30:25.315 --> 00:30:26.555\nIt's what we've been doing for decades.\n\n596\n00:30:26.555 --> 00:30:28.094\nAnd then lastly, Dashboard bridges.\n\n597\n00:30:28.094 --> 00:30:30.710\nThat's really the three main ones\nthat we need to worry about.\n\n598\n00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:34.130\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, episode as usual,\nDon, on managing applications.\n\n599\n00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:36.081\nSo rewatch it a couple of times.\n\n600\n00:30:36.081 --> 00:30:37.143\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know I'm going to.\n\n601\n00:30:37.143 --> 00:30:39.547\nAnd then before we move on,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n602\n00:30:39.547 --> 00:30:40.744\n&gt;&gt; That's the main thing,\n\n603\n00:30:40.744 --> 00:30:44.410\nI do wanna mention if you do install\nan app from the App Store it auto updates.\n\n604\n00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.500\nI didn't really talk about updates for\nnon App Store Apps.\n\n605\n00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.080\nYou just have to go to\nthe vendor's website.\n\n606\n00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.390\nYou have to find out\nthat they have an update.\n\n607\n00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:55.420\nSome of them like Microsoft Office,\nif you install that from Microsoft,\n\n608\n00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.920\nthey have a special application that\nyou run that is the update application.\n\n609\n00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.950\nBut you have to run it to check for\nupdates, otherwise you don't know.\n\n610\n00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:06.140\nSo updates, the ball is in your court if\nyou're installing the application from\n\n611\n00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.440\noutside of the App Store.\n\n612\n00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.550\n&gt;&gt; Good advice, Don.\n\n613\n00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:12.400\nAnd Apple Certified Support Professionals,\na wonderful

00:00:07.610\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.859\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:17.010\nchoosing ITPro.TV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.870\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.160\nFor this episode of Apple\ncertified Support Professionals\n\n8\n00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.560\nwe are going to be application data now.\n\n9\n00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.890\nThat's right, and the person who is going\nto be helping us with that is the one and\n\n10\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.620\nonly Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.720\nHey Don, good to see you.\n\n12\n00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.370\nHey great to see you too Zach and we are\ncontinuing our adventure on applications.\n\n13\n00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.321\nIf you watched our last episode we talked\nabout how to install applications, and\n\n14\n00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:40.719\nwhere they came from, and\nall that other stuff.\n\n15\n00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.228\nAnd we really kind of painted this picture\nof an application is being one file.\n\n16\n00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:48.213\nBut there's actually a lot more\nto an application as you run it,\n\n17\n00:00:48.213 --> 00:00:49.535\nit generates a lot data.\n\n18\n00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:53.065\nAnd so in this episode, we're gonna be\nfocusing on what that other data is.\n\n19\n00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:57.784\nAll the ancillary files and\ninformation that goes along with that\n\n20\n00:00:57.784 --> 00:01:01.055\nsingle file that looks\nlike an application.\n\n21\n00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:04.175\nIt's involved, and\nit's easy to lose track of.\n\n22\n00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:08.435\nIf you've ever bumped into this where you\nuninstall an application to delete it, and\n\n23\n00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.091\nthen later you reinstall it, and\n\n24\n00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:12.770\neverything's still set up\nthe way that it used to be.\n\n25\n00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.350\nIt remembers everything,\nhow the heck did it do that?\n\n26\n00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.862\nIt's because there's all of these\nother files that get left behind.\n\n27\n00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:21.502\nSo we're gonna look at some of those\nright here in this episode and\n\n28\n00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:24.346\nkinda find out how that works,\nknow where to look to find those files.\n\n29\n00:01:24.346 --> 00:01:26.463\nAnd see how we can kinda use those for\ntroubleshooting and\n\n30\n00:01:26.463 --> 00:01:29.160\nresetting an application to get\nit back to the way that it was.\n\n31\n00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.166\nThat's all coming up right\nhere in this episode.\n\n32\n00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:31.818\n&gt;&gt; Good stuff, so\n\n33\n00:01:31.818 --> 00:01:35.087\nwhere does application data get stored?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n34\n00:01:35.087 --> 00:01:36.774\nI wish I had a single answer for that,\n\n35\n00:01:36.774 --> 00:01:41.410\ncuz there's actually a number of different\nplaces where the data gets stored.\n\n36\n00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.827\nFirst off, there's the stuff\nthat's really visible to us.\n\n37\n00:01:43.827 --> 00:01:48.366\nIf I install Microsoft Word and\nI start typing a letter and I save it,\n\n38\n00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:52.922\nwherever I choose to save that is\nwhere some of it's data's going.\n\n39\n00:01:52.922 --> 00:01:55.632\nNow that's visible data,\nthat's data we wanna see.\n\n40\n00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:58.345\nAnd visible stuff like that normally\ngoes into our documents folders.\n\n41\n00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:05.300\nSo for example if I go into my finder, and\nin my finder, I'n in my home directory.\n\n42\n00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.790\nAnd in my home directory,\nI've got a Documents folder.\n\n43\n00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.420\nAnd so that's likely where my\napplication is storing the data that it\n\n44\n00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.770\ngenerates, right?\n\n45\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.380\nAlthough if it's a graphics editing\nprogram, maybe it saves into the Pictures\n\n46\n00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.050\nfolder, or Movies, or Music, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,\n\n47\n00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.560\nmm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n48\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.220\nthis is the highly visible\nstuff that we see.\n\n49\n00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.390\nAs a end-user,I could choose\nto store stuff other places.\n\n50\n00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.600\nSo for example,\nI have a program called AJA MiniConfig,\n\n51\n00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.000\nwhich lets me use a little zoom-in\ntool under the desk here [LAUGH].\n\n52\n00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.970\nI have a program called Resilio Sync\nthat I use to synchronize files\n\n53\n00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.170\nbetween my computers.\n\n54\n00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.000\nAnd those two programs, for\n\n55\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.710\nwhatever reason the authors of those\nprograms decided, well, it would be crazy\n\n56\n00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.800\nto stick that in Documents, we're gonna\nput them out here in these folders, right?\n\n57\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.590\nAnd there is actually a reason for\nthat, the main reason is iCloud.\n\n58\n00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.790\niCloud synchronizes\nthe Documents folder by default,\n\n59\n00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.210\nsynchronizes this right up\ninto the iCloud storage.\n\n60\n00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.300\nWell, for\n\n61\n00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.720\nsomething like Resilio Sync, I could have\nterabytes of files being synchronized.\n\n62\n00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.260\nAnd I might not want those\nto go into iCloud, and\n\n63\n00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.900\nI wouldn't have that choice if\nit was in the documents folder.\n\n64\n00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.050\nI also run a program called VMware Fusion,\nand\n\n65\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.920\nwith VMware Fusion I can\ncreate virtual machines.\n\n66\n00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.110\nAnd those virtual machine files,\nthey'll end up being 60 gigs sometimes,\n\n67\n00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.210\nthey can be pretty big files.\n\n68\n00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.830\nWell, VMware Fusion does put the virtual\nmachines in the Documents folder.\n\n69\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.966\nSo I can see it right here, here's a bunch\nof these virtual machines that I've made.\n\n70\n00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:27.145\nSo, for example,\n\n71\n00:03:27.145 --> 00:03:32.402\nin some of the earlier episodes you guys\nmight have seen me running OS10 10.8.\n\n72\n00:03:32.402 --> 00:03:35.520\nI don't actually have a computer here\nrunning 10.8, that would be crazy.\n\n73\n00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.054\nI'd have to have a time machine,\nlike a real time machine.\n\n74\n00:03:38.054 --> 00:03:39.434\n&gt;&gt; Good, let's get one.\n\n75\n00:03:39.434 --> 00:03:40.763\n&gt;&gt; Can we get Orson Wells in here or\n\n76\n00:03:40.763 --> 00:03:42.479\nwhatever, no, Jules?\n&gt;&gt; H.G.\n\n77\n00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:43.709\nWells.\n&gt;&gt; Was it H.G.\n\n78\n00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.239\nWells?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n79\n00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:44.809\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n80\n00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.260\nwe have to really get creative\nhere to be able to do that.\n\n81\n00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.220\nSo I use the virtual machine and\nit's all stored right here in that file.\n\n82\n00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.580\nWell those files can be\na little on the big side,\n\n83\n00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.379\nright, this one is 100 gigs in size.\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna synchronize\n\n84\n00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.410\nthat into iCloud, iCloud's free\nstorage is only 5 gigs anyway.\n\n85\n00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.227\nI'd have to pay to get to this level.\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n86\n00:04:03.227 --> 00:04:04.411\n&gt;&gt; In fact that's even over the second\n\n87\n00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.800\ntier, the second tier's 100 gigs.\n\n88\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.110\nI'd have to pay for the higher tier\nof storage, it would cost some money.\n\n89\n00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.410\nSo a lot of vendors choose\nnot store that way.\n\n90\n00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.710\nAnd that means that the visible\nfiles your application creates,\n\n91\n00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.730\nthey can be in any number places and\nyou can even overwrite it.\n\n92\n00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.307\nWhen I go into Microsoft Word,\nI'll fire it up.\n\n93\n00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:27.067\nAnd I start to type a nice new,\nyeah, great,\n\n94\n00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:30.387\nI definitely wanna do that Microsoft,\nthank you [LAUGH].\n\n95\n00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:35.192\nAnd I create a new document, so\nthis is a document, it is awesome, and\n\n96\n00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:36.620\nI go to save it.\n\n97\n00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.950\nWhen I save,\nit asks me where I wanna save it.\n\n98\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.770\nAnd it will usually default\nto your Documents folder, but\n\n99\n00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.390\nyou can actually come in and\npick anywhere you want.\n\n100\n00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.220\nSo finding that application\ndata's really hard,\n\n101\n00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.668\nbut it's made a little bit easier\nin that these files are visible.\n\n102\n00:04:52.668 --> 00:04:55.992\nIf I save it to my Desktop,\nI'm going to see that document, right?\n\n103\n00:04:55.992 --> 00:05:00.593\nIt'll show up on my Desktop,\nI can see it right here in the background,\n\n104\n00:05:00.593 --> 00:05:03.600\nright, or\nI can see it in my Documents folder.\n\n105\n00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.883\nThe files I really need to worry about\nthough, are the ones that are hidden,\n\n106\n00:05:06.883 --> 00:05:08.130\nthe ones that we can't see.\n\n107\n00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.090\nEvery application is gonna generate\nat least one of these, and\n\n108\n00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.540\nthat is what's called a preference file.\n\n109\n00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.030\nA preference file is a file that contains\n\n110\n00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.810\nall the settings inside\nof that application.\n\n111\n00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.380\nSo for example if I take,\n\n112\n00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.070\nI'll use the program I was using in\nthe last episode, ForkLift, all right?\n\n113\n00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.670\nHere's ForkLift,\nit's a little file manager, all right?\n\n114\n00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.810\nAnd it doesn't really make files itself\nit allows me to manage my files, so\n\n115\n00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.490\nI can browse around here and start\nmanaging files, doing all sorts of stuff.\n\n116\n00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.780\nWell, if I want,\nI can change ForkLift's appearance.\n\n117\n00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.060\nMaybe I don't like this light appearance,\nI want it to be a dark appearance.\n\n118\n00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.410\nSo I can go up into ForkLift and\nPreferences.\n\n119\n00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.349\nAnd when I go into the preferences for\nForkLift, I can enable dark mode.\n\n120\n00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.250\nAnd in the background it just changed and\nnow it's a file manager suitable for\n\n121\n00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.030\nBatman, right?\n\n122\n00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.170\nIt's got.\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n123\n00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.970\n&gt;&gt; Multiple shades of grey, that's it, and\n\n124\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:04.850\nthere we are.\n\n125\n00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.380\nSo how does it remember that\nI want it to be in dark mode?\n\n126\n00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.182\nIt saved in a preference file, and\n\n127\n00:06:12.182 --> 00:06:14.925\nthat preference file is\nan example of a hidden file.\n\n128\n00:06:14.925 --> 00:06:20.396\nOne that's stashed away, that we can't\nnormally get at, we can't normally see.\n\n129\n00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:24.663\nAnd there may be many of these files,\nnot just preference files, but things like\n\n130\n00:06:24.663 --> 00:06:29.204\nlibrary files, or extensions, other things\nthat make this application do its job.\n\n131\n00:06:29.204 --> 00:06:31.130\nSo let me show you where\nthese are in terminal.\n\n132\n00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.570\nAnd I'll kinda help you\nspot some of those.\n\n133\n00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.690\nNow, where it gets tricky is there\nare global preferences that affect\n\n134\n00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.380\nthe entire computer, and then there's\nuser preferences that affect just me.\n\n135\n00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.120\nSo if I log in, I might have ForkLift\nset up for the dark mode and then,\n\n136\n00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.320\nif Zack logs in, he might have\nForkLift set for the light mode.\n\n137\n00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.420\nSo two separate sets of preferences,\nbut there'll be a third set\n\n138\n00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.120\nof preferences at the global that\nsays these are the defaults.\n\n139\n00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.085\nWhen a new user fires up Forklift,\n\n140\n00:07:01.085 --> 00:07:04.350\n[COUGH] this is how it'll be\nconfigured by default, and then\n\n141\n00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.150\nthey can change it if they want and it'll\nchange in their user preferences, right?\n\n142\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.800\nSame thing goes for the support files that\ngo along with it, any other extensions or\n\n143\n00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.770\nlibraries.\n\n144\n00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.670\nThere’s global ones,\nthat are available for everybody, and\n\n145\n00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.980\nthen there’s user ones that\nare available just for you.\n\n146\n00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.500\nLet me show you the global ones first.\n\n147\n00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.000\nIf I go into the /Library folder,\ninside of /Library,\n\n148\n00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.750\nyou’ll find a folder called\nApplication Support.\n\n149\n00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.400\nSo, /Library/Application Support.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n150\n00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.530\n&gt;&gt; And inside of there,\n\n151\n00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.300\nyou’ll find support files.\n\n152\n00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.804\nAnd I can see files in here for\nVMware, my virtualization software,\n\n153\n00:07:40.804 --> 00:07:45.710\nI've got Viscosity, it's a VPN software\nI use, I don't see AGA in here.\n\n154\n00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.040\nSo, I guess the Mini-Config software\ndoesn't have any support files,\n\n155\n00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.176\nnot every program does.\n\n156\n00:07:50.176 --> 00:07:54.540\nLogitech does, GarageBand, So these\nare places where they have files that\n\n157\n00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.080\nextend the functionality\nof that application, right.\n\n158\n00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.990\nMicrosoft has something.\n\n159\n00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:04.850\nIf I go into Microsoft,\nthat should be Office, the MAU2.0\n\n160\n00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.642\nis the Microsoft Automatic Updater,\nthe tool that updates Microsoft Office.\n\n161\n00:08:08.642 --> 00:08:12.410\nAnd so\nthere is the actual auto update app.\n\n162\n00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.790\nIt is an entire application\nstored in the support folder, and\n\n163\n00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.522\nthat is because all of the Microsoft\napplications can call this one program.\n\n164\n00:08:20.522 --> 00:08:23.520\nAnd it has to be allowed\nthrough Apple sandbox.\n\n165\n00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.560\nThe protected boundaries it\nputs around applications.\n\n166\n00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.590\nThose are the things\nthat I find right here.\n\n167\n00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:35.360\nI can also go back into the library\nfolder and into references, right?\n\n168\n00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.760\nSo this is /library/preferences.\n\n169\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.630\nAnd if I look in here,\n\n170\n00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:45.650\nI will find a collection of files\nthat are a name of a program.\n\n171\n00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.770\nAnd in the end in .p list, okay?\n\n172\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.020\nIf I look at these programs,\n\n173\n00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:56.280\njust VMI fusions, here's a bunch\nof Apple programs and so on.\n\n174\n00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.120\nAll of these correlate to some\nkind of program that I'm writing.\n\n175\n00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.410\nAnd then P list is an abbreviation for\npreference list.\n\n176\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.560\nThis is a list of all the preferences\nthat you may have said.\n\n177\n00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.520\nNow I showed you fork lift as my example.\n\n178\n00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.100\nAnd as I look down this list, the company\nthat makes it is a company called,\n\n179\n00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.650\nBinary Knights.\n\n180\n00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.725\nSo I don't see com.binaryknights.\n\n181\n00:09:17.725 --> 00:09:21.020\nI see com.apple and or.cups.\n\n182\n00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.900\nI don't see com.binaryknights.\n\n183\n00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.370\nVMWare isn't following the standard.\n\n184\n00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.550\nThey should be showing up\nas com.vmware.whatever, but\n\n185\n00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.190\nthey didn't follow it for whatever reason.\n\n186\n00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.760\nSo as I look down this list,\nI don't see everything,\n\n187\n00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.310\nand that's because these\nare the global preferences.\n\n188\n00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.400\nAnd most applications are gonna\nset preferences per user,\n\n189\n00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.490\nso everybody making their own.\n\n190\n00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.950\nWell, the two folders I just showed you,\nthey're inside of /users as well.\n\n191\n00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.180\nIf I go into /users/ and\nwhatever my username is, and\n\n192\n00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.640\nthen go into /library.\n\n193\n00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.634\nInside of here,\nthere's an application support folder.\n\n194\n00:09:57.874 --> 00:10:01.250\nAnd I can start to see more applications,\nright?\n\n195\n00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.450\nSo I see something that I\ndidn't see in the other screen.\n\n196\n00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:04.070\nSo for example,\n\n197\n00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:09.080\nSimpleDiagrams 4 is a little graphics and\ndiagramming tool that I use.\n\n198\n00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:14.940\nI see a bunch of other applications\nlike Royal TSX and And Forklift.\n\n199\n00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.340\nForklift has some\napplication support files.\n\n200\n00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.180\nAnd if I come in here and take a look at\nthat, I can see where it's got, favorites.\n\n201\n00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:28.110\nIf I want to set up a list of favorites\nthat I can quickly jump to, or log files.\n\n202\n00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.570\nHere's what I can get to the log files for\nForklift and\n\n203\n00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.520\nI can see if it had an error, give me the\ninformation on it tell me what happened.\n\n204\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.480\nThose are support files.\n\n205\n00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:43.440\nBut I can also go into the library\nfolder and preferences.\n\n206\n00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.810\nSo now I'm in\n/user/depossess/library/preferences and\n\n207\n00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:54.050\nwhen I look in here,\nnow I find a lot more programs including,\n\n208\n00:10:54.050 --> 00:11:01.060\nI hope that I'm not wrong here,\nthis com.binarynights.forklift-3.plist,\n\n209\n00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.470\nthat's the preferences for ForkLift 3.\n\n210\n00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.090\nI actually had ForkLift 2 before,\nand upgraded, so\n\n211\n00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.150\nit's got my old preferences\nfrom ForkLift 2.\n\n212\n00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.550\nBut there's the ForkLift 3\npreferences right there and stored.\n\n213\n00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.930\nThese are all files that go\nalong with the application.\n\n214\n00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.090\nAnd if I uninstall the application,\nif I just drag the forklift app, and\n\n215\n00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.620\ndrop it into the recycle bin,\nwhat happens to this P list file?\n\n216\n00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.920\nIt stays there.\n\n217\n00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.740\nIt saves all my preferences.\n\n218\n00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.850\nSo if I reinstall Forklift in the future,\nit remembers how everything was set up,\n\n219\n00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.450\nbecause the preference\nlist file is right there.\n\n220\n00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.790\nAnd they are not big.\n\n221\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.830\nIf I extend that listing out,\nand take a look,\n\n222\n00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.260\nactually let me to ALS-LH to\nget human readable sizes, and\n\n223\n00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.017\nI come in here and\nI find that [INAUDIBLE] File, here it is.\n\n224\n00:11:46.017 --> 00:11:48.481\nIt's a whopping 7.3 kilobytes.\n\n225\n00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:50.780\nVery, very, very, small.\n\n226\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.530\nSo it's not like we're taking up\na bunch of hard drive space here, and\n\n227\n00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.430\nit saves those preferences, and it'll\nremember exactly how it had it set it up.\n\n228\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:58.960\n&gt;&gt; Can we further view or\n\n229\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.590\nedit the preference files?\n&gt;&gt; You can.\n\n230\n00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.620\nIt's not exactly easy.\n\n231\n00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.960\nSo in older versions of Mac OS,\nand I mean really old,\n\n232\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.930\nI think it was 10.7 and earlier,\nthese were just text files.\n\n233\n00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.270\nAnd you could.\nYou could just edit them and\n\n234\n00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.550\ngo in and see it.\n\n235\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:18.920\nThey started compiling these into binary\nfiles so that they're kind of compressed,\n\n236\n00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:26.140\nand if I try and look at one, let's\ntake a look at the Forklift one right?\n\n237\n00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.569\nSo if I try and view this file.\n\n238\n00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.160\nYea, it\n\n239\n00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.680\ndoesn't actually look very good, right?\n\n240\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.640\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n241\n00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.730\n&gt;&gt; Because it's compressed.\n\n242\n00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.050\nSo if I want to view that,\nI would have to decompress it first.\n\n243\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.430\nNow, most of us aren't going to do that.\n\n244\n00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.850\nAnd the reason Apple does this is they\ndon't want you editing these files.\n\n245\n00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.380\nThey want you to say, all right,\nif I need to change a preference,\n\n246\n00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.050\nI need to launch the application-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n247\n00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:49.600\n&gt;&gt; And change the\n\n248\n00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.310\npreference in there.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n249\n00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.280\n&gt;&gt; I showed you guys where I went into\n\n250\n00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.360\nthe preferences for ForkLift and\n\n251\n00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.920\nI checked off dark mode.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n252\n00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.550\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n253\n00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.050\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n254\n00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.110\n&gt;&gt; Well that's the way\n\n255\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.270\nthey want you to do it.\n\n256\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:02.780\nThe problem is sometimes there are\npreferences that the developer creates and\n\n257\n00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.200\nthey just haven't put it in the GUI yet.\n\n258\n00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.050\nAnd if you could come in and edit this\nfile, you could set it and change it and\n\n259\n00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.300\nthen, it would work inside\nof the application.\n\n260\n00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.300\nApple says hey, a good developer would\nactually put it in the GUI cuz that's kind\n\n261\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.770\nof their thing, but\nnot every developer does that.\n\n262\n00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.230\nSo, if you would ever need to, if you\never do need to edit one of these files\n\n263\n00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.520\nthere is a utility called the PL util.\n\n264\n00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.900\nRight.\nThe preference list utility.\n\n265\n00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.100\nAnd you can use this utility.\n\n266\n00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.160\nIt's built into Mac OS by default.\n\n267\n00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.300\nI didn't install this.\n\n268\n00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.630\nIf you do a clean install,\nyou'll already have it.\n\n269\n00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:40.230\nAnd it allows you to decompress as\nwell as recompress a preference file.\n\n270\n00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.030\nAll right.\n\n271\n00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.620\nAnd you do need to recompress it before\nthe system will be able to use it\n\n272\n00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.650\nand work with it.\n\n273\n00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.740\nSo let me make sure\nthat I closed forklift.\n\n274\n00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.090\nI did not so\nI'm gonna quit out of forklift.\n\n275\n00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.470\nWe don't want to mess around with the\npreference file while the application is\n\n276\n00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.690\nactually up and running.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n277\n00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:55.560\n&gt;&gt; Causing problems but\n\n278\n00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:01.400\nonce I'm in here I can run plutil and\nthen I could say -convert.\n\n279\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.520\nAnd I could convert the file.\n\n280\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.330\nNow there's two formats here.\n\n281\n00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.210\nThere's the text file format,\nwhich is actually an XML format.\n\n282\n00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.520\nSo I can convert it to an XML file.\n\n283\n00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.550\nAnd then there's the binary format, the\ncompressed format that it's in right now.\n\n284\n00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:21.040\nSo I'm going to convert it to the XML\nformat, and it's called XML1.\n\n285\n00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.700\nApple's got room here to add new versions.\n\n286\n00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.730\nIf they introduce some kind\nof new preference format,\n\n287\n00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.850\nit'll be called XML2 or XML3.\n\n288\n00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.700\nThis is just XML 1.\n\n289\n00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.820\nSo Im gonna say, -convert xml1, and\n\n290\n00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.280\nthen I'm gonna specify\nthe file that I'm converting.\n\n291\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.940\nAnd so I'm doing that\ncom.binarynights.forklift-3.plist.\n\n292\n00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:45.500\nAnd when I run that, it's going\nto basically decompress it, okay?\n\n293\n00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.677\nSo if I look at my,\n\n294\n00:14:51.184 --> 00:14:55.511\nPlist files now, there it is,\nand it looks unchanged, right,\n\n295\n00:14:55.511 --> 00:14:59.450\nthe same filename, it's still a .plist.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n296\n00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.990\n&gt;&gt; Let me change that to a -lh.\n\n297\n00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.018\nAs far as the size, it got bigger.\n\n298\n00:15:06.018 --> 00:15:09.720\nIt's not 7.4 k anymore\nnow it's 10 k because\n\n299\n00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.370\nit was compressed now it's not all right?\n\n300\n00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:20.870\nMore importantly though, I can take that\nfile and I can read it now all right?\n\n301\n00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.430\nI can look at it and\nit's a standard xlm document here it is.\n\n302\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.290\nAnd look at the first thing\nthat I see right here.\n\n303\n00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.270\nKey dark mode, value true.\n\n304\n00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.170\nI turned on dark mode, and\nthere's where that setting is.\n\n305\n00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:34.730\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep, yep, yep.\n\n306\n00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.630\n&gt;&gt; And as we continue to look down,\n\n307\n00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:41.200\nwe've got other information like just our\nkey chain accessibility migration, or\n\n308\n00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.480\nlast window frame and\nthe data based on it.\n\n309\n00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.370\nAnd boy, did it stop at just the right,\n\n310\n00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.320\nbecause apparently the next thing that's\ngonna be on the screen is my license key,\n\n311\n00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.638\nwhich-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:15:49.638 --> 00:15:50.770\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna share on the air.\n\n313\n00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:54.608\nSo [COUGH] I can see those\nsettings right here.\n\n314\n00:15:54.608 --> 00:15:57.116\nI can edit them and change them, right?\n\n315\n00:15:57.116 --> 00:15:59.790\nAnd I can change dark mode to false.\n\n316\n00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.240\nOr is it false?\n\n317\n00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.325\nMaybe if this key is totally absent,\nthen that means it's false.\n\n318\n00:16:07.325 --> 00:16:11.845\nAlso, if that key is present,\nthen it means that it goes into dark mode.\n\n319\n00:16:11.845 --> 00:16:14.015\nYou do need to understand how\nthe developer stores these settings.\n\n320\n00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:16.495\nSometimes it’s not entirely obvious.\n\n321\n00:16:16.495 --> 00:16:20.785\nSo, in this scenario, though,\nthat dark mode shows up as true, and\n\n322\n00:16:20.785 --> 00:16:21.675\nit knows to put it in there.\n\n323\n00:16:21.675 --> 00:16:24.503\nSo I could come in and edit that,\nor change something else,\n\n324\n00:16:24.503 --> 00:16:27.231\nwhatever it is that I need,\nto modify in those settings.\n\n325\n00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:30.801\nNow, after I’m done, once I've\nchanged it to meet all my needs, and\n\n326\n00:16:30.801 --> 00:16:34.691\neverything's kinda set the way that I\nwant, I need to recompress it again.\n\n327\n00:16:34.691 --> 00:16:40.030\nI need to use that plutil again, right?\n\n328\n00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.590\nIn fact, you can just use your up arrow\nand pull up the line that you used from\n\n329\n00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:50.210\nbefore, because all your gonna do\nis change it from xml1 to Binary1.\n\n330\n00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:54.770\nSo I'm gonna convert that same\nutility back to the binary format.\n\n331\n00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.680\nAnd when I run that,\nit's gonna convert it.\n\n332\n00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.373\nAnd now,\nif I were to take a look at that file,\n\n333\n00:17:01.373 --> 00:17:05.427\nit's back to being the compressed mess.\n&gt;&gt; It's so pretty.\n\n334\n00:17:05.427 --> 00:17:07.168\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it comes up.\n\n335\n00:17:07.168 --> 00:17:09.087\nIt's a bunch of junk, and\nthere it is right on the screen.\n\n336\n00:17:09.087 --> 00:17:10.670\nSo it's kinda hard to read.\n\n337\n00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.010\nYou can sort of see some of\nthe information in there.\n\n338\n00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:19.100\nBut for the most part,\nyou can't really figure out what that is.\n\n339\n00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.510\nYou definitely can't edit it because\nthat's gonna break things down.\n\n340\n00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, is there a way that we can stop\n\n341\n00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:27.540\npeople from changing\nan application's preferences?\n\n342\n00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.200\n&gt;&gt; You can.\n\n343\n00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:34.140\nApple says that if you can't trust\nsomebody to modify preferences, then you\n\n344\n00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.700\nshouldn't trust them to use the computer,\nbasically is their kinda stance on it.\n\n345\n00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:44.770\nBut let's say that you're setting up\na lab for elementary school students or\n\n346\n00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.770\nhigh school students, and they get into\na mess with settings and all that.\n\n347\n00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.308\nWhat you could do is you could get\nthe preferences set exactly the way that\n\n348\n00:17:51.308 --> 00:17:51.834\nyou want.\n\n349\n00:17:51.834 --> 00:17:53.909\nAnd then you can do what's\ncalled locking the file.\n\n350\n00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:56.542\nA locked file can't be modified,\nright, and\n\n351\n00:17:56.542 --> 00:17:58.780\nlocking a file is not a hard thing to do.\n\n352\n00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.930\nYou can do it through\nthe GUI if you wanted.\n\n353\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.280\nWhen you lock a file, if somebody tries to\nmodify it, it just gives a warning that\n\n354\n00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:10.280\nsays, hey, in the GUI, the little file,\n\n355\n00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.070\nI actually have little lock icon on it so\nyou know that it's locked.\n\n356\n00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:18.980\nAnd in fact, if I wanted, I could take,\nlet's just take a file that I've got.\n\n357\n00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.411\nLike if I take this,\n\n358\n00:18:20.411 --> 00:18:25.230\nthis is a private key that I use to\nconnect to a demo account, right?\n\n359\n00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.154\nI don't want somebody to\nmodify that private key.\n\n360\n00:18:27.154 --> 00:18:28.990\nIt would invalidate the key.\n\n361\n00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:33.710\nSo if you do a get information on it,\nand you take a look at the file,\n\n362\n00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:38.110\nyou'll see right up here at the top where\nit's gonna have an option to lock it.\n\n363\n00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.510\nAnd if I check that, it locks it.\n\n364\n00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.900\nAnd now, really hard to see, but\n\n365\n00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.630\nthere's that tiny little lock\nthat appears on an icon.\n\n366\n00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.860\nAnd now people cannot modify that file.\n\n367\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.530\nIf I go back over here, somewhere here and\n\n368\n00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:56.320\nlook at the GUI, I can see that\nlock is showing up there as well.\n\n369\n00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.900\nIt's a locked file, it can't be modified.\n\n370\n00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.620\nThat's easy through the GUI,\n\n371\n00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.630\nbut I don't see those preference files\nthrough the GUI by default, do I?\n\n372\n00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:10.030\nIf you wanted,\nyou could go up here to the go menu.\n\n373\n00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.270\nAnd in the go menu,\nyou don't see library by default.\n\n374\n00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.045\nBut if you hold down Option,\nyou can choose Library.\n\n375\n00:19:17.045 --> 00:19:21.379\nAnd once you see the Library folder,\nfrom there we can come in and\n\n376\n00:19:21.379 --> 00:19:27.087\nwe can get to the Preferences folder which\nis buried in here somewhere, there we go.\n\n377\n00:19:27.087 --> 00:19:30.903\nAnd now we can come in and we can find\nthat com, that binary [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n378\n00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:32.630\nlock that file through the GUI.\n\n379\n00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.070\nSo that's one way to do it.\n\n380\n00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:41.051\nYou can also do it from the command\nline by using the CH flags command.\n\n381\n00:19:41.051 --> 00:19:49.211\nSo I could say SUDU, cuz you have to be an\nadministrator to do it, CH flags no UCHG.\n\n382\n00:19:49.211 --> 00:19:52.730\nIn other words, no user change.\n\n383\n00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.080\nAnd then specify whatever that file is.\n\n384\n00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.096\nBy doing that, it locks it.\n\n385\n00:19:58.096 --> 00:19:59.000\nSame thing as the GUI.\n\n386\n00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.726\nThis is just a command line version of it.\n\n387\n00:20:00.726 --> 00:20:04.217\nIf I wanted to lock this preference\nfile across 1,00 machines,\n\n388\n00:20:04.217 --> 00:20:06.062\nI don't wanna use the GUI for that.\n\n389\n00:20:06.062 --> 00:20:09.653\nI would probably take Apple Remote Desktop\nand feed this command into it.\n\n390\n00:20:09.653 --> 00:20:13.690\nAnd then blast that out to 1,000 machines,\nand that would just run and\n\n391\n00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.049\nknock it all out at once.\n\n392\n00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:16.689\nSo a couple of different\nways to lock that,\n\n393\n00:20:16.689 --> 00:20:18.690\nstop people from changing the system.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n394\n00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:24.410\nhow does MacOS know which application\nis attached to which documents?\n\n395\n00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:28.305\nAll right, so that's a good question is I\nkeep talking about applications like I'm\n\n396\n00:20:28.305 --> 00:20:31.090\ngonna go and\nrun the application itself, right?\n\n397\n00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.400\nBut that's not always what we do.\n\n398\n00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.470\nIn fact, usually, we go in,\nand we find a document, and\n\n399\n00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.160\nwe just double-click on the document.\n\n400\n00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.901\nSo for example, if I come into\nmy documents folder, actually,\n\n401\n00:20:41.901 --> 00:20:44.275\nit's probably not a good example here.\n\n402\n00:20:44.275 --> 00:20:49.255\nI have my virtual machines, which\nare a file that ends in .vmwarevm, right?\n\n403\n00:20:49.255 --> 00:20:53.613\nAnd if I double-click on one of these\nmachines, VMware's gonna fire up and\n\n404\n00:20:53.613 --> 00:20:55.260\nit's gonna launch the VM.\n\n405\n00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.887\nSo I didn't go and launch VMware.\n\n406\n00:20:57.887 --> 00:21:01.238\nI came and launched this file or\nmy show notes, right?\n\n407\n00:21:01.238 --> 00:21:05.837\nIf I take my show notes, here's the notes\nthat I make for each of my shows and\n\n408\n00:21:05.837 --> 00:21:08.004\n[INAUDIBLE] for the show.\n\n409\n00:21:08.004 --> 00:21:09.470\nHere, application data program.\n\n410\n00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.160\nSo if I take this file,\nit's a markdown file.\n\n411\n00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.270\nAnd I use a program called\nSublime Text to edit those files.\n\n412\n00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:20.080\nSo when I double-click on that,\nI can fire that up.\n\n413\n00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.550\nIt goes right into Sublime Text and\nthen here's the file, I can come in and\n\n414\n00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:24.180\nmodify it.\n\n415\n00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.320\nAnd now I remember what to\nsay when I'm on camera.\n\n416\n00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.190\nPretty useful, but I have more than\none program that can use this.\n\n417\n00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.860\nSo I could go into any text editor and\nopen up that same file.\n\n418\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.470\nI could go into another program I have\ncalled Haroopad and open up this file.\n\n419\n00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.550\nI could go into Marked, which is\nthe program I used to print these things.\n\n420\n00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.440\nSo I have probably four or\nfive programs that could open that file.\n\n421\n00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.308\nSo how did it know which one to use?\n\n422\n00:21:50.308 --> 00:21:54.681\nWell, there's actually a preference that\nsets that, a preference for the Finder\n\n423\n00:21:54.681 --> 00:21:58.820\nwhere the Finder keeps track of which\napplication is tied to which extension.\n\n424\n00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:03.209\nAnd when you install a program,\nit'll normally register with an extension.\n\n425\n00:22:03.209 --> 00:22:04.416\nBut if you're like me, and\n\n426\n00:22:04.416 --> 00:22:07.460\nyou got five different programs that\ncan open up this one extension,\n\n427\n00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.460\nit'll usually just be mapped to whatever\nis the most recent one you installed.\n\n428\n00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.420\nAnd so that's not really gonna work out\nfor us here, so I'll need to come in and\n\n429\n00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.320\nchange that.\n\n430\n00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:21.125\nAnd the easiest way to change\nit is right here from the GUI,\n\n431\n00:22:21.125 --> 00:22:25.638\nif you do a Cmd+I or\nCtrl+ click or two-finger tap and\n\n432\n00:22:25.638 --> 00:22:30.540\nthen get info on a file in question,\nin the get info screen,\n\n433\n00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.050\nit shows you what that\nfile's gonna open with.\n\n434\n00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.580\nMine says it's gonna\nopen with Sublime Text.\n\n435\n00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.290\nI could change it and say,\nI want to use Haroopad or\n\n436\n00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.380\nMarked or\napparently Microsoft Word can open it.\n\n437\n00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.350\nI didn't know that.\n\n438\n00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.030\nTextEdit, I can pick\nthe application I want.\n\n439\n00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.940\nMaybe I want Marked, so\nI'll pick that one, right?\n\n440\n00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:56.110\nNow when I do that,\nthat's gonna change just this one file.\n\n441\n00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:00.990\nThis one file will now open with\nMarked versus Sublime Text.\n\n442\n00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.870\nBut if I wanna change it for every single\nfile on my computer that is a markdown\n\n443\n00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.160\nfile like this,\nI can use the Change All button.\n\n444\n00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:15.480\nAnd that's gonna say for now on I wanna\nopen up every markdown file with Marked.\n\n445\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.330\nAnd so if I continue to do that,\nthat change is gonna take effect.\n\n446\n00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.598\nAnd eventually,\nit doesn't happen right away,\n\n447\n00:23:21.598 --> 00:23:25.168\nthe icons will change here in the Finder\nto reflect the icon of the new program.\n\n448\n00:23:25.168 --> 00:23:28.326\nBut even before that happens,\nif I double-click on that,\n\n449\n00:23:28.326 --> 00:23:30.616\nit doesn't launch Sublime Text anymore.\n\n450\n00:23:30.616 --> 00:23:32.324\nNow, it launches Marked too.\n\n451\n00:23:32.324 --> 00:23:36.111\nAnd there's my notes in the pretty\nformat that we've print and\n\n452\n00:23:36.111 --> 00:23:38.808\nI can see that right here on the screen.\n\n453\n00:23:38.808 --> 00:23:42.177\nSo that lets me change which\nprogram is handling that, and\n\n454\n00:23:42.177 --> 00:23:44.050\nit's not that painful, is it?\n\n455\n00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:48.551\nWe just come in here,\nwe pick the appropriate program.\n\n456\n00:23:48.551 --> 00:23:50.260\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n457\n00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.350\n&gt;&gt; And then we just hit Change All and\n\n458\n00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.700\nwe're in business, all right?\n\n459\n00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.716\nNow in the background, it's actually\ndoing something much harder, right?\n\n460\n00:23:56.716 --> 00:24:00.966\nIn the background,\nit's modifying A preference file for\n\n461\n00:24:00.966 --> 00:24:03.490\nwhat are called launch services.\n\n462\n00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:08.295\nWhat I just modified was a preference\nof the finder tracks that says what\n\n463\n00:24:08.295 --> 00:24:11.390\nservice can I use to launch this file.\n\n464\n00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:15.250\nAnd you can see that yourself\ninside of a couple of places.\n\n465\n00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:23.103\nBut the main place is\n/library/Preferences/com.apple.\n\n466\n00:24:25.156 --> 00:24:26.760\nAnd oop, do I not have any global ones?\n\n467\n00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.296\nI might not have any global ones.\n\n468\n00:24:28.296 --> 00:24:30.790\nNope, sorry, I'm changing directory and\nit's just a file.\n\n469\n00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.630\nIf I go into /library/preferences,\nand I look in here,\n\n470\n00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:39.760\nI can find com.apple.LaunchServices,\nlet me see if I can find it here.\n\n471\n00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.140\nAnd I might not have any global ones\nbecause I am not seeing it in here, but\n\n472\n00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.550\nit will be called com.apple., and\nthen you'll see LaunchServices.\n\n473\n00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:51.039\nNow in my case I don't have a global one\nbut I should at least have a user one, so\n\n474\n00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:52.729\nlet's go see if I can find a user one.\n\n475\n00:24:52.729 --> 00:24:59.272\nI'll go into /Users/dpzet/Preferences\n\n476\n00:24:59.272 --> 00:25:04.345\nsorry /library then Preferences.\n\n477\n00:25:06.689 --> 00:25:09.220\nAnd then I'm gonna take a look in here and\n\n478\n00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.280\nsee if I can find\ncom.apple.LaunchServices.\n\n479\n00:25:13.967 --> 00:25:17.415\nAnd there we go.\n\n480\n00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:19.157\nThanks goodness, cuz if I didn't find it,\n\n481\n00:25:19.157 --> 00:25:21.995\nI'd have to explain how the heck did\nit know when I changed a moment ago.\n\n482\n00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:25.021\nIf I haven't changed any of the defaults,\n\n483\n00:25:25.021 --> 00:25:28.601\nwhich at the global level you usually\nhaven't, then you won't find the file.\n\n484\n00:25:28.601 --> 00:25:29.731\nBut at the user level,\n\n485\n00:25:29.731 --> 00:25:33.015\nI am pretty much guaranteed to\nhave changed at least one default.\n\n486\n00:25:33.015 --> 00:25:36.076\nSo I'll have that LaunchServices\nright there com.apple.LaunchServices,\n\n487\n00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:38.090\nthat's where it's tracking that.\n\n488\n00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.030\nAnd that in this case you'll\nsee is actually a folder,\n\n489\n00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:44.130\nand if I go in there, there will be\nmore plist files inside of there.\n\n490\n00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:48.070\nAnd I can use plutil to mess with those,\nbut it's far easier to do it from the GUI.\n\n491\n00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:51.670\nBut again if you're rolling this\nout over 1,000 different computers,\n\n492\n00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.520\nhere is a way where we can do it\nprogrammatically from the command line.\n\n493\n00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:01.520\nSo you can get in there and look at that\nand see what those things are set to.\n\n494\n00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:07.630\nAnd so if I look in there,\nI actually just have one plist file.\n\n495\n00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.538\nBut we can see it,\nmodify it as we need, and\n\n496\n00:26:09.538 --> 00:26:13.590\nthen push it out as appropriate.\n&gt;&gt; Don, what if we want to do a one time\n\n497\n00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:17.341\nchange and not something that's permanent?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so everything I've done so\n\n498\n00:26:17.341 --> 00:26:20.010\nfar is kind of, well,\nI'll say it's permanent.\n\n499\n00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.430\nBut it has to be undone.\n\n500\n00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:22.103\nIf I don't undo it,\n\n501\n00:26:22.103 --> 00:26:23.220\nit is going to be permanent.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n502\n00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.740\nright.\n&gt;&gt; If I just, one time, want to say all\n\n503\n00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.700\nright, yeah, I want this, my Markdown\nstuff, cuz I actually do this every day.\n\n504\n00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:36.650\nI write my show notes in Markdown, that's\nhow I write it, and I use Sublime Text.\n\n505\n00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:37.921\nThat's the program I use.\n\n506\n00:26:37.921 --> 00:26:41.990\nSo 99% of the time I\nwant it to open that way.\n\n507\n00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:44.060\nBut in the morning when I print,\n\n508\n00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.720\nSublime Text doesn't print and\nI need to print stuff out on paper.\n\n509\n00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.160\nSo I use.\n\n510\n00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.880\nSo just that one time I want\nto open in and print out.\n\n511\n00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.170\nAnd so, you can do that.\n\n512\n00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:58.383\nYou can take any file and\nif you two-finger tap or CTRL click or\n\n513\n00:26:58.383 --> 00:27:03.992\nright-click, there's so many different\nways to pull up this context menu now.\n\n514\n00:27:03.992 --> 00:27:08.181\nBut if you pull up the context menu of\na file, and you look at your menu options,\n\n515\n00:27:08.181 --> 00:27:09.210\nyou'll see Open.\n\n516\n00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.440\nThat says open with whatever\nthe default was set to.\n\n517\n00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.570\nBut then you've got Open With.\n\n518\n00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.750\nAnd when you choose Open With,\nthere's that whole list.\n\n519\n00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.910\nBut unlike the other Open With\nthat I showed you a moment ago,\n\n520\n00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.660\nwhen we went in to Get Info,\nthis one is just temporary.\n\n521\n00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.630\nIt just takes effect right now.\n\n522\n00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:29.340\nSo I can choose to open it with Marked 2,\nand when I do that,\n\n523\n00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.440\nit opens up with Marked 2.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n524\n00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.450\n&gt;&gt; But the moment I close that,\n\n525\n00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.630\nI can come back and\ndouble-click on the file.\n\n526\n00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.330\nAnd it goes back to Sublime Text.\n\n527\n00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:41.070\nIt was a temporary thing, one time change,\nputs it in effect, and now I’m back in,\n\n528\n00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.870\nand in business.\n\n529\n00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.700\nSo, that’s how we would do it, and\n\n530\n00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.970\nnot actually change what the default is.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n531\n00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:48.140\nAnother wonderful episode.\n\n532\n00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.580\nWell done, Don.\n\n533\n00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.970\nApplication data this is part one,\nthere's gonna be a part two.\n\n534\n00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:54.730\nMake sure you see both of those.\n\n535\n00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.047\nAnd anything else you'd like\nto say before we move along.\n\n536\n00:27:57.047 --> 00:27:58.527\n&gt;&gt; Yep, as Zach mentioned part two,\n\n537\n00:27:58.527 --> 00:28:01.333\nthere are two other features that\nI've run out of time to get to and\n\n538\n00:28:01.333 --> 00:28:02.828\nthat's quick look and autosave.\n\n539\n00:28:02.828 --> 00:28:06.371\nThey're two really cool parts that\nare built into the Mac OS operating system\n\n540\n00:28:06.371 --> 00:28:07.570\nthat I wanna highlight and\n\n541\n00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:11.210\nshow you how those impact the files\nthat our applications create as well.\n\n542\n00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:12.270\nSo be sure to stay tuned for\n\n543\n00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.010\nthose features in part two.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n544\n00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:18.720\nalso be sure to watch every single episode\nof Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n545\n00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.040\nWonderful series that Don's\nput together for you.\n\n546\n00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.500\nIt will help you, and\nyou'll be in the course library,\n\n547\n00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.530\nwhere there's thousands of other videos,\nand they're there to help you go further.\n\n548\n00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:28.500\nCheck them out.\n\n549\n00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.418\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n550\n00:28:30.418 --> 00:28:32.400\nITProTV is

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:05.576 --> 00:00:06.621\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:08.293\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:11.962\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:14.452\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:14.452 --> 00:00:17.540\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n8\n00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.680\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\n\n9\n00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.090\nas we continue on with\nApple Certified Support Professional,\n\n10\n00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.680\nApplication Data part two.\n\n11\n00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.720\nAnd once again,\nDon Pezet here to help us out.\n\n12\n00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.970\nDon, good to see you, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.230\n&gt;&gt; Hey, great to be back, Zach.\n\n14\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.840\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\ncontinue on with application data.\n\n15\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.140\nAnd we're gonna look at two really cool\nfeatures that are built into macOS.\n\n16\n00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.552\nA lot of what we've talked about\nhas been behind the scenes,\n\n17\n00:00:39.552 --> 00:00:43.690\nwhere these files are stored, and\npermissions, and crazy stuff like that.\n\n18\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.950\nThis episode, we're gonna look at two\nfeatures, one called Quick Look, and\n\n19\n00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.160\nanother called Auto Save,\nthat are very visible, very up front.\n\n20\n00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.320\nEvery user sees them every day,\nprobably has no idea they exist.\n\n21\n00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.070\nThey just kinda do something and\nmake their life easier.\n\n22\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.170\nAnd so the really cool,\nneat functions we have in macOS that just,\n\n23\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.810\nthey're kind of quality\nof life improvements,\n\n24\n00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.310\nthat make people's user experience a lot\nbetter when dealing with application data.\n\n25\n00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.330\nSo we're going to take a look at\nthose right here in this episode.\n\n26\n00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.780\n&gt;&gt; And everybody like life hacks.\n\n27\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.940\nWhat is Quick Look and how do we use it?\n\n28\n00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.049\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Quick Look is a neat one.\n\n29\n00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.250\nLike its name implies, it gives you\na quick look at application data.\n\n30\n00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.260\nNow when we generate application data,\nso maybe I fire up Microsoft Word and\n\n31\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.430\nI save a Word document or I fire up\nTextEdit and I create a text document.\n\n32\n00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.960\nWe need some way to be able to\nsee what's in that document.\n\n33\n00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.410\nNow you're probably saying, well,\njust open the document, Don.\n\n34\n00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.260\nThis is a simple problem to solve.\n\n35\n00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.160\nBut in today's day and age, there are so\n\n36\n00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.850\nmany malicious actors out there that\nare sending out fake documents,\n\n37\n00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.530\ndocuments that they say hey,\nhere's my resume, take a look at it.\n\n38\n00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.780\nAnd you open it up, and\nit's a macro enabled Word document.\n\n39\n00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.010\nAnd all of a sudden, your computer's\ngot malware or viruses whatever.\n\n40\n00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.640\nSo Apple wanted to make that a little\nbit easier and say, we want people to\n\n41\n00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.470\nhave an idea of what's in a file without\nexposing them to the security risk.\n\n42\n00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.680\nOr we want them to see what's in a file\nwithout going through all the trouble of\n\n43\n00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.880\nlaunching the application\nthat created the file.\n\n44\n00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.630\nSo for example, let's say I had a picture.\n\n45\n00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.890\nSo just some kind of, well here,\nlet's just fire up Safari.\n\n46\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.070\nAnd I'll go to we'll go to the NHL today.\n\n47\n00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.660\nSo the NHL, they have this picture,\nand I want to download that image.\n\n48\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.950\nSo I'm just going to save that image,\nand I'll save it to my desktop.\n\n49\n00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.870\nNow when I save it to my desktop,\nthat's just saving an image.\n\n50\n00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.190\nIt's right there,\nit's sitting right there on my desktop.\n\n51\n00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.350\nAnd if I wanna view that, I can open\nit with a number of different programs.\n\n52\n00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.071\nMaybe I've got Pixelmator or\nAdobe Photoshop,\n\n53\n00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:53.070\nor something like that installed.\n\n54\n00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.893\nActually, I do have Pixelmator here.\n\n55\n00:02:54.893 --> 00:02:57.087\nSo I'm gonna open that in Pixelmator.\n\n56\n00:02:57.087 --> 00:03:00.334\nAnd when I do that,\nPixelmator has to load.\n\n57\n00:03:00.334 --> 00:03:04.230\nIt has to bring all this stuff\ninto RAM and get fired up.\n\n58\n00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.090\nNow, Pixelmator loads pretty fast,\nor at least on my laptop, it does.\n\n59\n00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.020\nThings like Adobe Photoshop,\nthey take a while to load.\n\n60\n00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.510\nIt's a lot of activity to generate on\nthe system just to view this file.\n\n61\n00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.820\nSo what Quick Look does is it says, man,\n\n62\n00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.460\nwe want you to be able to see these files\nwithout having to open them all the way.\n\n63\n00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.210\nAnd it does it two different ways.\n\n64\n00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.010\nIn the first way,\nwe can see right here in my ebooks folder.\n\n65\n00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.760\nI've got this ebooks folder where\nI have a number of PDFs, right?\n\n66\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.640\nAnd the first thing you'll\nnotice are the icons, right?\n\n67\n00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.780\nNow if I'm in a list view,\nthe icons are really small.\n\n68\n00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.418\nBut the icon is actually the first\npage of each of these PDFs.\n\n69\n00:03:48.418 --> 00:03:53.890\nmacOS has looked inside of the PDF,\nfound the first page,\n\n70\n00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.080\nand rendered it as the icon.\n\n71\n00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.680\nAnd it actually modified it a little bit,\n\n72\n00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.790\nsee how it put this black\nspiral binding on it?\n\n73\n00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n74\n00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.120\n&gt;&gt; That's because it's a PDF,\nthat's not actually in the first page.\n\n75\n00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.740\nIf I open that document, if I actually\njust fire that one up and open it,\n\n76\n00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.480\nhere's the first page.\n\n77\n00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.510\nSee how there's no black spiral\nbound notes on the side or anything?\n\n78\n00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.260\nIt's just, here's the PDF,\nand we go in and read it.\n\n79\n00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.390\nSo what they've done\nis they've gone in and\n\n80\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.390\nsaved me a little bit of time, and\nmade it where I can see what that book is,\n\n81\n00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.460\nor what that first page is,\nwithout actually opening it.\n\n82\n00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.120\nThat's really handy if\nsomebody has changed the name.\n\n83\n00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.940\nSo maybe the file name doesn't match\nwhat the contents are anymore, or\n\n84\n00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.820\nif it's a document pretending\nto be something that it's not.\n\n85\n00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I can quickly and\n\n86\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.890\neasily see that, right?\n\n87\n00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.500\nSo that's one feature of Quick Look.\n\n88\n00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.170\nAnother thing is, if I want to actually\nsee inside of that document, right?\n\n89\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.500\nBut maybe I don't wanna\nopen the whole thing.\n\n90\n00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.110\nWell, normally I'll double-click on it.\n\n91\n00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.350\nAnd double-clicking on it will\nopen it up in the program.\n\n92\n00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.810\nNow if I had Adobe Acrobat installed,\nthe PDF would open in there.\n\n93\n00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.000\nAnd Acrobat takes a while to load, and\n\n94\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.120\nall of the features of\nthe PDF will be enabled.\n\n95\n00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.850\nBut if I just view it in Preview, for\n\n96\n00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.170\nexample, Preview will show me the document\nbut it doesn't have all of the features.\n\n97\n00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.190\nBut I can just highlight a file.\n\n98\n00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.810\nAnd if I hit the space bar on my keyboard,\nit's gonna come up, and\n\n99\n00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.210\nthis is not Preview.\n\n100\n00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.350\nSo I don't have an Acrobat\nreader installed.\n\n101\n00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.750\nAnd so when I double-click on it,\nit's launching Preview.\n\n102\n00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.780\nSee, I can see the application\nname up here, this is Preview.\n\n103\n00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:35.210\nAnd that is up here, built into macOS\nPreview version 10.0, and that's it.\n\n104\n00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.809\nAnd I can now see the book,\n[COUGH] I can read through it.\n\n105\n00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:41.850\nI've got my bookmarks or\ntable of contents over here.\n\n106\n00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.950\nI can search and find, and\n\n107\n00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.270\ndo all the things that we expect\nto do when we're reading a book.\n\n108\n00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.740\nBut if I get out of Preview,\nI can highlight that book,\n\n109\n00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.400\nI can hit the space bar.\n\n110\n00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.390\nAnd when I do,\nthe window looks different, right?\n\n111\n00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.900\nIf I look up top, I'm still in the Finder.\n\n112\n00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.150\nI'm not actually in any other program.\n\n113\n00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.610\nI was browsing the file system in Finder\nand now the Finder is showing me the file.\n\n114\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.970\nAnd if I look at the top of that preview,\nwell it says open with Preview, right?\n\n115\n00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.370\nSo it's telling me hey,\nthis is not the full version of the book.\n\n116\n00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.070\nWe're showing you a limited\nfunctionality version, so\n\n117\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.440\nyou can have a quick look at\nthe contents of that file.\n\n118\n00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.900\nIf I just want to take a look at it real\nquick just to see, is this the right book?\n\n119\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.215\nI was looking for my iOS security book.\n\n120\n00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:28.680\nOops, nope, this is Absolute BSD.\n\n121\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.340\nThis is the wrong one, so\nlet me check the next one.\n\n122\n00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.200\nAnd I can hit my space bar, and\ninstantly that preview pops up.\n\n123\n00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.080\nIt's not loading some program.\n\n124\n00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.660\nIt's not having to bring\na bunch of stuff into RAM.\n\n125\n00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.970\nIt's not enabling a ton of features,\nits just a quick preview.\n\n126\n00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.980\nAnd to be honest with you, for most\ndocuments, this quick preview is enough.\n\n127\n00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.060\nI can see everything that I need.\n\n128\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.260\nI can scroll through the whole document,\nnot just one or two pages.\n\n129\n00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.170\nAnd I can read it.\n\n130\n00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.919\nI can't search for text,\nI can't highlight things and take notes.\n\n131\n00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.474\nI can't save it in a different format.\n\n132\n00:07:05.474 --> 00:07:07.892\nAll of those features, yes,\nI need the full program.\n\n133\n00:07:07.892 --> 00:07:10.050\nBut if I just wanna look at a document,\n\n134\n00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.758\nI can do it right here by\nhitting that space bar.\n\n135\n00:07:12.758 --> 00:07:15.010\nAnd pow, now I'm looking at it.\n\n136\n00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:20.870\nAnd I'm just seeing that kinda of a,\nwell, a quick look into that document.\n\n137\n00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.490\n&gt;&gt; But\ndoes Quick Look work with all files?\n\n138\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.640\n&gt;&gt; It works with a lot of files, right?\n\n139\n00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.400\nSo this is a PDF that I\nwas just showing you.\n\n140\n00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.930\nI actually didn't see that, that picture\nthat I stole from the NHL here is a PNG.\n\n141\n00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.699\nSo that's a PNG.\n\n142\n00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:35.777\nAnd if I take it,\n\n143\n00:07:35.777 --> 00:07:40.670\nI know Quick Look is working because\nthe icon is showing that picture.\n\n144\n00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.750\nAnd if I hit a space bar on it, whoops.\n\n145\n00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.580\nIf I try and hit the space bar on it,\nthere we go, it comes up.\n\n146\n00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.644\nAnd the same thing,\nI see it open with preview.\n\n147\n00:07:48.644 --> 00:07:52.239\nAnd I see the picture and\nso on, that stuff shows up.\n\n148\n00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:56.944\nBut if you come across a file that's not\nsupported, Then it won't show up with\n\n149\n00:07:56.944 --> 00:08:01.600\na little icon like this, it'll just how\nup as the little page and that's it.\n\n150\n00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.890\nSo, it doesn't support everything,\nbut does support a lot.\n\n151\n00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:10.066\nI'll put the full list in the Show Notes,\nbut it's things like HTML links,\n\n152\n00:08:10.066 --> 00:08:14.795\nPDFs, JPEG, PNG, GIFs,\nWord documents, text files,\n\n153\n00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:19.320\nmost documents like that,\nit supports, right?\n\n154\n00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.390\nBut for example, my Show Notes.\n\n155\n00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:25.350\nWhen I write my Show Notes,\nlet me switch my view here.\n\n156\n00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.970\nI write my Show Notes in\ntwo different formats.\n\n157\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.310\nI write them in a format called Markdown.\n\n158\n00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:35.610\nAnd Apple has basic support for Markdown,\nand so I can see that right here.\n\n159\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.710\nHere's my Markdown file, and I actually\nget a little bit of a preview of it there.\n\n160\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.790\nIf I hit Space though,\nit's just rendering Markdown as text.\n\n161\n00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.620\nThis is the text that I write\nwhen I create my notes.\n\n162\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:53.460\nBut I also take that text and I render\nit as a PDF, which quickly does support.\n\n163\n00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:58.370\nAnd if I view the PDF version of that\nsame file, now it's a lot neater,\n\n164\n00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.280\nI can click on links,\nthings actually show up the right way.\n\n165\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.170\nBut it's actually kind of\na low quality render there.\n\n166\n00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.450\nSee how bad that text looks?\n\n167\n00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks a little weird.\n\n168\n00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.830\n&gt;&gt; Pretty bad, right?\n\n169\n00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.330\nQuick Look does that sometimes.\n\n170\n00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.410\nIt's having to render this\nstuff on the fly, and\n\n171\n00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:19.650\nif I double click on that, or\nuse the Open with Preview link instead,\n\n172\n00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.490\nnow it's gonna open up\nin an actual PDF reader.\n\n173\n00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.561\nAnd see all the text is nice and\nclear now?\n\n174\n00:09:25.561 --> 00:09:26.150\nRight?\n\n175\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.410\nSo Quick Look is not the perfect\nsolution for viewing these things.\n\n176\n00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.760\nIf you are a photographer,\n\n177\n00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.651\nyou don't wanna rely on Quick Look to\npick which photo is better than another.\n\n178\n00:09:35.651 --> 00:09:37.485\nCuz all of these are reduced.\n\n179\n00:09:37.485 --> 00:09:40.110\nYou wanna open those in your\nactual photo editing software.\n\n180\n00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.190\nBut if you're just an average joe, and\n\n181\n00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.450\nyou're trying to find a picture you\ntook of your kids birthday last year.\n\n182\n00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.164\nQuick Look is perfect.\n\n183\n00:09:46.164 --> 00:09:50.143\nYou can just scroll right through and look\nat all the stuff and find what you want.\n\n184\n00:09:50.143 --> 00:09:52.470\nSo, pretty neat functionality there.\n\n185\n00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.550\nThe other thing is that\n\n186\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.190\nsometimes it hasn't had time\nto render the Quick Look yet.\n\n187\n00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.950\nSo it has to cache this stuff.\n\n188\n00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.740\nWhen the system is idle and Spotlight is\nrunning and indexing your hard drive.\n\n189\n00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.760\nWhenever it comes across a document that\nQuick Look supports, it's pre-rendering,\n\n190\n00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.890\nwhat that icon should look like, and the\npreview of the pages, so its got it handy.\n\n191\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.690\nIf it hasn't indexed yet,\nyou might not have it.\n\n192\n00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.490\nAnd then when you press\nthe Spacebar on a file,\n\n193\n00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.310\nit might take a little while\nlonger to render that Quick Look.\n\n194\n00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.190\nOr the icon might not show\nup quite right just yet.\n\n195\n00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.740\nAnd it just takes a little\nbit of time to render up.\n\n196\n00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.310\n&gt;&gt; But Don what if I have\nfiles that are not supported?\n\n197\n00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.280\nSo if you have a file\nthat's not supported,\n\n198\n00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.190\nthere's not a whole lot\nthat you can do personally.\n\n199\n00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:41.290\nApple chooses what files are supported,\nand they bake that into MacOS.\n\n200\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.680\nBut third parties can actually release\ntheir own extensions if they want.\n\n201\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.660\nSo, for example, maybe Adobe decides\nto start using some new file format.\n\n202\n00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.700\nThey could push out a Quick Look\nextension for that, and\n\n203\n00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.465\nit would be added to the system.\n\n204\n00:10:53.465 --> 00:10:56.900\nIt usually added when you install\nthe related software, right?\n\n205\n00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.360\nBut you can, if you Google around,\n\n206\n00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.300\nyou can find providers that\nprovide quick look add ons.\n\n207\n00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.870\nIf you want to see the ones that\nare installed, you can jump into your\n\n208\n00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:09.080\nterminal, and they're actually\nparked away on your hard drive.\n\n209\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.810\nThe global ones,\nthe ones that are available for everybody,\n\n210\n00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:16.182\nare found in /Library/QuickLook.\n\n211\n00:11:16.182 --> 00:11:18.980\nIf you look in /Library/QuickLook and\n\n212\n00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:24.130\nhave a peak, these are ones that have\nbeen installed globally after the fact.\n\n213\n00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.810\nSo I've iBooks Author and iWork.\n\n214\n00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:31.900\nIf you have the iWork which pretty\nmuch every Mac user does, and if you\n\n215\n00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.380\nhave iBooks Author, which you may or may\nnot have, I downloaded it at some point.\n\n216\n00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:39.545\nThen, these extensions got added in, and\nyou'll see these are just files ending\n\n217\n00:11:39.545 --> 00:11:43.409\n.qlgenerator, the Quick Look generator\nthat's gonna run and do that.\n\n218\n00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.580\nThe ones that are packaged with the\nsystem, cuz obviously there's a lot more\n\n219\n00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:55.790\nthan these, if you look inside of\n/System/Library/QuickLook, there we go.\n\n220\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.120\nHere's all the ones that\nI've been using so far.\n\n221\n00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.950\nSo the PDF one we saw,\nthe graphics one is named Funny,\n\n222\n00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.485\nwhere is it, image, Image.qlgenerator.\n\n223\n00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.340\nYou'll see live photo,\nwe've got Security.qlgenerator, Text,\n\n224\n00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.910\nWeb, iBooks, iCal, all these\ndifferent ones that are available.\n\n225\n00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.400\nThose are part of the system.\n\n226\n00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.724\nAnd then if you've\ninstalled some yourself,\n\n227\n00:12:18.724 --> 00:12:20.696\nthose would be in your home directory.\n\n228\n00:12:20.696 --> 00:12:28.377\nIf I go into /Users/dpezet\n/Library/Quicklook.\n\n229\n00:12:28.377 --> 00:12:31.670\nWhoops, I don't have any installed so\nI dont have a Quick Look folder.\n\n230\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:35.240\nBut if you go into your Users/Library, and\n\n231\n00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.780\ntake a look in there if you have\na Quick Look folder in here,\n\n232\n00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.540\nthose will be ones that are installed just\nfor your user account that you can use.\n\n233\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.960\nI don't have any third party ones\ninstalled just from my account.\n\n234\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.830\nSo there's nothing showing up here.\n\n235\n00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.550\nSo, you might be able to find one for\nyour vendor.\n\n236\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:53.300\nMicrosoft Office used to be that\nway before it got official support.\n\n237\n00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.690\nSo now Apple provides that support.\n\n238\n00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.740\nWe don't have to actually\nget it from Microsoft.\n\n239\n00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.490\nBut, in the past they did have\na Microsoft one you could add.\n\n240\n00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.550\nTheres some other vendors that do\nit as well, it's just up to them.\n\n241\n00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.600\n&gt;&gt; That's very impressive,\nlet's move on to autosave.\n\n242\n00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.900\nNow what does that do?\n\n243\n00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.000\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I mentioned in\nthe beginning of episode two features,\n\n244\n00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.118\nQuick Look and autosave.\n\n245\n00:13:10.118 --> 00:13:12.960\nQuick look,\nwe don't have to configure did we?\n\n246\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.092\nIt just [SOUND], it does what it does,\nand it works and that's that, right?\n\n247\n00:13:17.092 --> 00:13:20.307\nAutosave on the other hand, well I guess\nyou could argue it does what it does, and\n\n248\n00:13:20.307 --> 00:13:21.583\nwe know it can configure it, but\n\n249\n00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:24.140\nit actually does have some\nconfiguration options.\n\n250\n00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:30.170\nWhat autosave does is it tries\nto help you not lose data, okay.\n\n251\n00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.540\nI've have had this happen\nbefore plenty of times where\n\n252\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.070\nmaybe I'm writing some document.\n\n253\n00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.810\nAnd I'll just say use TextEdit here.\n\n254\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:44.500\nSo I fire up TextEdit, and\nI decide that I'm gonna write my memoirs.\n\n255\n00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.920\nI need it.\n&gt;&gt; You should.\n\n256\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.290\n&gt;&gt; I need to share my\nmemoirs with the world.\n\n257\n00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:53.240\nAnd so I come here into good old TextEdit,\nand I say, I come up with something\n\n258\n00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.240\nreally witty and\ncreative like They were the best of times.\n\n259\n00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.560\nThey were the worst of times.\n\n260\n00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.508\n&gt;&gt; They were an annihalation.\n\n261\n00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:05.375\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nevermind.\n\n262\n00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:06.684\n&gt;&gt; That would be [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Private Joke, private joke.\n\n263\n00:14:06.684 --> 00:14:10.239\n&gt;&gt; And so\nI'm being incredibly original here.\n\n264\n00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:11.231\nBut I'm writing my memoirs, right?\n\n265\n00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:12.030\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n266\n00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.896\n&gt;&gt; I'm pouring my heart and\nsoul into this business.\n\n267\n00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:19.436\nAnd it's so important to me that I\ndon't bother to hit Save, right?\n\n268\n00:14:19.436 --> 00:14:22.778\nI've had this happen, you're writing\nan email, you're writing a document, and\n\n269\n00:14:22.778 --> 00:14:24.670\nyou just don't about\nhitting the Save button.\n\n270\n00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.950\nYou're just sitting there and\nyou're working,\n\n271\n00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:31.390\nand maybe there's a power outage, computer\ngoes off, what happened to you document?\n\n272\n00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.340\nIt's gone, right, or\nyou forget that you're writing it.\n\n273\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.470\nYou move back to a web browser and\nyou start watching YouTube for an hour.\n\n274\n00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.690\nAnd then you have an update and you say\nI need to reboot, and you reboot and\n\n275\n00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.370\nyou forget to save it, and\nthen you realize later and you're like no,\n\n276\n00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.396\nit's gone, right?\n\n277\n00:14:47.396 --> 00:14:52.050\nSo what autosave does Is it\nruns in the background and\n\n278\n00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.410\nit says, h ey,\nI'm watching what you're doing.\n\n279\n00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.392\nAnd if you haven't saved the document,\nI'm gonna save it for you.\n\n280\n00:14:58.392 --> 00:15:01.548\nI'm gonna save it, and\nI'm going to keep it ready.\n\n281\n00:15:01.548 --> 00:15:06.054\nAnd if the computer reboots, or if you\nlose power, when the computer comes back\n\n282\n00:15:06.054 --> 00:15:10.626\non I'll fire that program back up and I'll\nput you right back to the spot where you\n\n283\n00:15:10.626 --> 00:15:14.705\nleft off, you won't even miss a beat and\nyou're ready to go.\n\n284\n00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:17.450\nAutosave assumes that when we do work,\n\n285\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.480\nwe expect to keep it, which I think\nis a pretty safe assumption right?\n\n286\n00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.300\nNow, there's a few pros and\ncons to all of this but the idea\n\n287\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.930\nhere is that it's gonna retain our work\nand make sure that we don't lose it.\n\n288\n00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:34.496\nIn the past this was up to third parties,\nso if you created a graphics editor,\n\n289\n00:15:34.496 --> 00:15:39.224\nyou could choose to build in this type\nof functionality into your application.\n\n290\n00:15:39.224 --> 00:15:42.463\nMicrosoft did it with all of their\nOffice suit where they would autosave.\n\n291\n00:15:42.463 --> 00:15:44.652\nBut it was up to each vendor.\n\n292\n00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:48.702\nApple finally stepped in and said, you\nknow what, this is a really good feature,\n\n293\n00:15:48.702 --> 00:15:51.066\nlet's just bake it into\nthe operating system.\n\n294\n00:15:51.066 --> 00:15:54.902\nAnd now all the application vendors\nout there They're not all having\n\n295\n00:15:54.902 --> 00:15:56.236\nto reinvent the wheel.\n\n296\n00:15:56.236 --> 00:15:58.800\nThey don't have to create their own\nAutoSave, they can just use ours.\n\n297\n00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.140\nAnd so that's what Apple did,\nthey put in place and\n\n298\n00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:06.040\nit's running, running right now, even\nthough I don't necessarily know it, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.172\nThat functionality is built in.\n\n300\n00:16:08.172 --> 00:16:13.233\nIt's saving it and not only that,\nApple said, hey, while we're in here we\n\n301\n00:16:13.233 --> 00:16:18.712\ncan leverage Time Machine technology\nhere too, and let's save file revisions.\n\n302\n00:16:18.712 --> 00:16:23.005\nLet's say I'm writing and\nthere's a paragraph and I don't like it,\n\n303\n00:16:23.005 --> 00:16:24.037\nand I delete it.\n\n304\n00:16:24.037 --> 00:16:28.459\nAnd I start writing some more and\nthen I go, that paragraph wasn't so bad.\n\n305\n00:16:28.459 --> 00:16:30.017\nCan I get it back?\n\n306\n00:16:30.017 --> 00:16:33.350\nMaybe your undo buffer might be\nable to get you back there but\n\n307\n00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:37.084\nsometimes it won't,\nespecially if your computer's rebooted or\n\n308\n00:16:37.084 --> 00:16:41.101\nif you've saved and now your undo\nbuffer is gone, how do you rollback?\n\n309\n00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:45.329\nWell, AutoSave is actually tracking\nrevisions as well and allowing you\n\n310\n00:16:45.329 --> 00:16:49.777\nto roll back to certain points where\nits kinda mapped that and collected it.\n\n311\n00:16:49.777 --> 00:16:52.537\nSo it's pretty neat\nthe way that it works and\n\n312\n00:16:52.537 --> 00:16:56.203\nit's all just kind of happening\nin the background for us.\n\n313\n00:16:56.203 --> 00:16:58.204\n&gt;&gt; Don, does it work in every app?\n\n314\n00:16:58.204 --> 00:17:03.129\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't, it'd be nice if it did and\nthat's Apple's vision.\n\n315\n00:17:03.129 --> 00:17:04.840\nApple wants it to work in every app.\n\n316\n00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.808\nBut the problem is they weren't\nfirst to market with this feature,\n\n317\n00:17:07.808 --> 00:17:09.954\nso a lot of applications\nalready have AutoSave.\n\n318\n00:17:09.954 --> 00:17:13.932\nAnd if your application already has\nAutoSave, then this AutoSave could\n\n319\n00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:17.335\ninterfere with it, and\nthat would be a real problem, right?\n\n320\n00:17:17.335 --> 00:17:22.290\nSo what they had to do is, basically,\nmake this an optional feature.\n\n321\n00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.380\nSo as an end user how do you\nknow if it's gonna work, right?\n\n322\n00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.132\nLet me show you.\n\n323\n00:17:26.132 --> 00:17:29.888\nSo in TextEdit, now TextEdit,\nthat's from Apple,\n\n324\n00:17:29.888 --> 00:17:34.484\nso Apple is obviously gonna bake\nthis into all of their products.\n\n325\n00:17:34.484 --> 00:17:39.468\nI know that it has the AutoSave\nfunctionality because if I go up to my\n\n326\n00:17:39.468 --> 00:17:44.185\nFile menu, under File,\nyou can always spot programs that have\n\n327\n00:17:44.185 --> 00:17:48.022\nAutoSave because they have\nthis Revert To option.\n\n328\n00:17:48.022 --> 00:17:52.711\nOkay, Revert To,\nthat's gonna let me know that I can roll\n\n329\n00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:55.881\nback to some previous version, okay?\n\n330\n00:17:55.881 --> 00:18:00.131\nNow, I just created this\ndocument here on this show.\n\n331\n00:18:00.131 --> 00:18:05.499\nSo it's telling me that I can roll\nback to a last saved at 10:33.\n\n332\n00:18:05.499 --> 00:18:08.483\nI never hit save I haven't\nsaved this one single time.\n\n333\n00:18:08.483 --> 00:18:10.389\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; I know that because see how it still\n\n334\n00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:11.501\nsays Untitled up here?\n\n335\n00:18:11.501 --> 00:18:12.780\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And it says edited,\n\n336\n00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.690\nI've made changes but\nI haven't saved it yet.\n\n337\n00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:18.271\nSo I know I haven't saved it, but\nit's showing a previous version.\n\n338\n00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:20.671\nThat's the Autosave functionality.\n\n339\n00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:22.632\nAnd I can go to Browse All Versions, and\n\n340\n00:18:22.632 --> 00:18:25.912\nif I've been working on this\ndocument awhile, which I have not.\n\n341\n00:18:25.912 --> 00:18:31.912\nWhen I choose it, see how it goes into\na view that is very Time Machine-esque.\n\n342\n00:18:31.912 --> 00:18:35.399\nIt looks a lot like Time Machine,\nexcept just for this one file.\n\n343\n00:18:35.399 --> 00:18:38.456\nAnd I can see here's the current document.\n\n344\n00:18:38.456 --> 00:18:42.196\nAnd over here,\nI can see the previous versions and\n\n345\n00:18:42.196 --> 00:18:47.288\nI can kind of scroll back and\nsee what it was like at each point prior.\n\n346\n00:18:47.288 --> 00:18:51.225\nAnd so if there was a paragraph that\nI deleted I can actually come and\n\n347\n00:18:51.225 --> 00:18:52.571\ncopy that paragraph.\n\n348\n00:18:52.571 --> 00:18:56.706\nAnd jump right back over here and paste\nit in and now I've got it back again.\n\n349\n00:18:56.706 --> 00:18:57.827\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n350\n00:18:57.827 --> 00:19:01.437\n&gt;&gt; Or I can just take the whole document\nand hit that restore button and\n\n351\n00:19:01.437 --> 00:19:05.773\nit's going to roll the whole thing back,\nand now I'm right back to that point.\n\n352\n00:19:05.773 --> 00:19:08.483\nSo that's how I can tell if it works.\n\n353\n00:19:08.483 --> 00:19:11.271\nNow, it get's a little confusing because,\nfor example,\n\n354\n00:19:11.271 --> 00:19:14.472\nI mention I write my show notes in\nthis text format called Markdown.\n\n355\n00:19:14.472 --> 00:19:17.285\nI use a program called Sublime Text for\nthat.\n\n356\n00:19:17.285 --> 00:19:21.518\nAnd with Sublime Text, here I'll just\nopen up a show note here real quick.\n\n357\n00:19:21.518 --> 00:19:23.320\nWe'll take like my outline.\n\n358\n00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.937\nAll right, so when I open it up,\nhere's this text file.\n\n359\n00:19:26.937 --> 00:19:29.096\nAnd I can write and work and all that.\n\n360\n00:19:29.096 --> 00:19:33.346\nIf I go up under my File menu, I don't see\n\n361\n00:19:33.346 --> 00:19:38.358\nthe Revert To option, but\nI do see Revert File.\n\n362\n00:19:38.358 --> 00:19:41.292\nWait a minute, this must support AutoSave.\n\n363\n00:19:41.292 --> 00:19:42.668\nWell, it's not Revert To and\n\n364\n00:19:42.668 --> 00:19:45.320\nit's not telling me I can\nbrowse the previous versions.\n\n365\n00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.120\nThat's not the one from AutoSave.\n\n366\n00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.382\nThis is where Sublime Text has\nbaked their own feature in.\n\n367\n00:19:50.382 --> 00:19:51.858\nAnd what this says is,\n\n368\n00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:55.980\nrevert to whatever the last file\nwas that you saved on the disk.\n\n369\n00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:02.516\nSo if I open the file and I make some\nchanges, so I add some text here, 123.\n\n370\n00:20:02.516 --> 00:20:05.322\nAnd then I can go up here to File and\nchoose Revert File and\n\n371\n00:20:05.322 --> 00:20:07.964\nit just puts it back to the way\nthat it was on the disk.\n\n372\n00:20:07.964 --> 00:20:11.600\nOne revision, that's it, that's all I get.\n\n373\n00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.938\nAutoSave though, it'll go back hours,\nweeks, through all sorts of revisions.\n\n374\n00:20:15.938 --> 00:20:17.356\nAnd if you're actually\nrunning Time Machine,\n\n375\n00:20:17.356 --> 00:20:18.640\nit'll show all the Time Machine ones too.\n\n376\n00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.621\nSo you can back to any number of revisions\non it, it's a pretty neat functionality.\n\n377\n00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:27.722\nThe author of Sublime Text has\nreally no motivation to go in and\n\n378\n00:20:27.722 --> 00:20:33.426\nuse Apple's AutoSave because\nthey've already written their own.\n\n379\n00:20:33.426 --> 00:20:37.557\nAnd not only that, they're multi-platform,\nso Sublime Text will run on Linux or\n\n380\n00:20:37.557 --> 00:20:39.809\nWindows, Apple's AutoSave isn't there.\n\n381\n00:20:39.809 --> 00:20:43.237\nSo several vendors have gone the route of\njust saying no, we're gonna do our own, or\n\n382\n00:20:43.237 --> 00:20:44.268\nwe're gonna ignore it.\n\n383\n00:20:44.268 --> 00:20:48.982\nSo it's not always there, but\nwhen it is, it works on automatically.\n\n384\n00:20:48.982 --> 00:20:52.991\nIt automatically saves and it remembers\nthe windows that you have open so\n\n385\n00:20:52.991 --> 00:20:57.394\nthat if you reboot or whatever, not only\ndoes it bring your documents back, but\n\n386\n00:20:57.394 --> 00:21:01.690\nit opens those windows back up and gets\nus put right back to where we need to be.\n\n387\n00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:05.044\n&gt;&gt; So\nwhat if I don’t want it to save my work?\n\n388\n00:21:05.044 --> 00:21:10.762\n&gt;&gt; All right, it's a pretty hard argument\nto say, I don't want it to save my work.\n\n389\n00:21:10.762 --> 00:21:13.382\nBut to say, I don't want it\nto reopen all these windows,\n\n390\n00:21:13.382 --> 00:21:15.026\nthat's a pretty realistic thing.\n\n391\n00:21:15.026 --> 00:21:16.081\nThat annoys me, right?\n\n392\n00:21:16.081 --> 00:21:21.862\nI use Terminal all the time and\nI'll be remoted into multiple machines,\n\n393\n00:21:21.862 --> 00:21:26.144\nI'll have two or\nthree different connections open.\n\n394\n00:21:26.144 --> 00:21:31.431\nAnd at the end of the day,\nwhen I close Terminal and I open it again,\n\n395\n00:21:31.431 --> 00:21:36.736\nI don't want it to have all these\ndifferent windows open and so on.\n\n396\n00:21:36.736 --> 00:21:42.084\nI'm in a bunch of different programs doing\n\n397\n00:21:42.084 --> 00:21:47.580\nwhatever it is I'm doing\nin the Terminal and\n\n398\n00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:52.047\nthen I close the Terminal, right?\n\n399\n00:21:52.047 --> 00:21:56.833\nWhen the Terminal closes, all these\nwindows are gonna go away, all right?\n\n400\n00:21:56.833 --> 00:22:00.554\nAnd when they go away,\nthat's usually what I want.\n\n401\n00:22:00.554 --> 00:22:04.008\nAnd then when I open up the Terminal\nagain, I just want one window so\n\n402\n00:22:04.008 --> 00:22:05.067\nI can go in and work.\n\n403\n00:22:05.067 --> 00:22:06.996\nI don't want it to open up all\nthose other windows again.\n\n404\n00:22:06.996 --> 00:22:12.438\nWell AutoSave will make it open\nall of those windows again, right?\n\n405\n00:22:12.438 --> 00:22:14.430\nAnd you'll notice mine didn't do that and\n\n406\n00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:18.371\nthat's because I've usually tweaked with\nthe settings on mine to make it not do it.\n\n407\n00:22:18.371 --> 00:22:20.744\nThis is where we differ from QuickLook.\n\n408\n00:22:20.744 --> 00:22:23.665\nQuickLook there are no options,\nit just does what it does and\n\n409\n00:22:23.665 --> 00:22:25.569\nmaybe you have to add some extensions.\n\n410\n00:22:25.569 --> 00:22:28.847\nAutoSave it does what it does,\nbut you can actually get in and\n\n411\n00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:30.333\nmanipulate its settings.\n\n412\n00:22:30.333 --> 00:22:33.891\nIf you wanna change it go into\nyour System Preferences, and\n\n413\n00:22:33.891 --> 00:22:38.532\nthis is done on a per-user basis, so\nevery user can have their own settings.\n\n414\n00:22:38.532 --> 00:22:42.207\nBut if you go into your\nUser Preferences and go into General,\n\n415\n00:22:42.207 --> 00:22:47.198\ninside of General you're going to see a\ncouple of options down toward the bottom.\n\n416\n00:22:47.198 --> 00:22:53.470\nAnd these options it's somewhat tricky,\ncuz they don't say AutoSave.\n\n417\n00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:58.645\nBut these two features right here, Ask\nto keep changes when closing documents,\n\n418\n00:22:58.645 --> 00:23:03.457\nand Close windows when quitting an app,\nthose two are actually AutoSave.\n\n419\n00:23:03.457 --> 00:23:04.921\nIt just doesn't say it.\n\n420\n00:23:04.921 --> 00:23:06.013\nBut that's what they are.\n\n421\n00:23:06.013 --> 00:23:11.232\nThe first one, Ask to keep\nchanges when closing documents.\n\n422\n00:23:11.232 --> 00:23:15.522\nWith AutoSave, it doesn't have\nto ask me if I want to save.\n\n423\n00:23:15.522 --> 00:23:18.817\nBecause it knows that I want to save,\nright?\n\n424\n00:23:18.817 --> 00:23:23.566\nSo this, when it's turned off,\nAutoSave is on, right?\n\n425\n00:23:23.566 --> 00:23:27.268\nIt's not gonna ask me to save,\nit's just gonna do it for me.\n\n426\n00:23:27.268 --> 00:23:31.679\nIf I check that though, now,\nwhen I'm working on a document,\n\n427\n00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:33.606\nit's not gonna AutoSave.\n\n428\n00:23:33.606 --> 00:23:37.866\nAnd if I close the document, it's gonna\nask me, hey Don, do you wanna save this?\n\n429\n00:23:37.866 --> 00:23:41.164\nAnd I can say no and\nthrow it away and now it's gone.\n\n430\n00:23:41.164 --> 00:23:44.572\nIt's gonna ask,\nI've effectively disabled AutoSave.\n\n431\n00:23:44.572 --> 00:23:49.727\nAll right, and then the next one here,\nClose windows when quitting an app.\n\n432\n00:23:49.727 --> 00:23:54.618\nWhen I close Terminal,\nit closed those three windows that I had.\n\n433\n00:23:54.618 --> 00:23:59.340\nAnd so when I launch Terminal again,\nit was one new window.\n\n434\n00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.730\nIf I turn that off, now I'm saying hey,\n\n435\n00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:06.390\nwhen I close Terminal remember\nthose three windows that I had.\n\n436\n00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.280\nAnd if I launch Terminal again,\nbring those three windows back.\n\n437\n00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.880\nAnd it'll open back in\nthe same way as it was closed.\n\n438\n00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:20.920\nWhen these two are off, I am now basically\nfunctioning in full autosave mode.\n\n439\n00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.110\nRight?\nWhich is weird.\n\n440\n00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:26.070\nIt's weird that you have to uncheck\nthese to be in the auto mode and\n\n441\n00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.400\nyou have to check them to be out of it.\n\n442\n00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.170\nIt's almost like a double negative or\nsomething.\n\n443\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.660\nBut for me, I like it when it auto saves.\n\n444\n00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.080\nI don't want to lose my work.\n\n445\n00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.770\nI don't like it when it brings\nopen all the windows again.\n\n446\n00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.530\nI would prefer it just to\ncome into a clean state and\n\n447\n00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.470\nthen I can open up\nthe documents that I want.\n\n448\n00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.750\nI might've been working\non ten documents before,\n\n449\n00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:49.340\nI don't need all ten to open up again,\nand you can change that.\n\n450\n00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.520\nIt does give you a little note here for\nthe second one.\n\n451\n00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.600\nWhen selected, open documents and\n\n452\n00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.390\nwindows will not be restored\nwhen you re-open an app.\n\n453\n00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.880\nThat's behavior that I like,\nis up to you which one you like but\n\n454\n00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.580\nthis two option right here are what\ntailors the behavior of auto save.\n\n455\n00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.730\n&gt;&gt; Is there's anything else\nthat auto save can do?\n\n456\n00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:13.780\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, that's probably pretty\nmuch it I mean the ability to control\n\n457\n00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:18.690\njust the saving of the files,\nbeing able to restore and roll back.\n\n458\n00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:22.140\nAs well as being able to\nrelaunch those windows.\n\n459\n00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.740\nThose are its primary functions,\nthat's what it's designed to do.\n\n460\n00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.030\nFor the most part,\n\n461\n00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.350\nas long as your applications support it,\nit works really well.\n\n462\n00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.400\nBut do be on the lookout for\napplications like Microsoft Office,\n\n463\n00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.480\nor Sublime Text in my example.\n\n464\n00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.180\nThat they don't have that integrated\nsupport they have their own functionality.\n\n465\n00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.700\nSo now your behavior can be\ndifferent between different apps but\n\n466\n00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.770\none day, one day maybe all of these\nvendors will move over to auto save and\n\n467\n00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.480\nwe can get consistent behavior,\n\n468\n00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.530\nbut once it's configured it's\ngonna work the way that we wanted.\n\n469\n00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:54.180\nEverything is gonna behave right.\n\n470\n00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.640\nBe aware though that it is per user.\n\n471\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.460\nSo Zach might go in and\nchoose to enable his features.\n\n472\n00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.950\nI might go in and disable my features.\n\n473\n00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:01.600\nAnd that's fine.\n\n474\n00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.400\nIt's done on our own user accounts and\nnow it's measured from there.\n\n475\n00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:10.630\nI do wanna mention one thing\nthat auto save can't do which is\n\n476\n00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:16.140\nif the original file is lost auto save\nis not going to be able to recover that.\n\n477\n00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.770\nYou have to have an original file\nsomewhere and as an example,\n\n478\n00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.100\ndid I already close text edit?\n\n479\n00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.270\nLet's see, yeah, I still have it, okay.\n\n480\n00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.940\nSo, technically I never have\nsaved this document, right?\n\n481\n00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:32.079\nI made it and I know auto save is\nworking that I can come in here and,\n\n482\n00:26:32.079 --> 00:26:36.190\nif I can, master my mouse here,\nI can go to File &gt; and\n\n483\n00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:41.255\nRevert To &gt; Browse All Versions,\nso I know that it's working.\n\n484\n00:26:41.255 --> 00:26:44.270\nAnd that I've got this information,\nactually, you know what,\n\n485\n00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:47.053\nI do restore this one\ncuz it's got more data.\n\n486\n00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:54.320\nAnd so anyhow, I can do that, I know it's\nworking, but I've still never saved it.\n\n487\n00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.330\nIf I get into text edit and quit out, so\n\n488\n00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:02.780\nI'm going to quit, because I've never\nsaved it, I haven't given it a file name.\n\n489\n00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:06.170\nIt is going to have to ask me\nwhat I want that file name to be.\n\n490\n00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.290\nIf I already had a file name,\nit would have saved it.\n\n491\n00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:09.430\nBut I haven't.\n\n492\n00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:10.650\nAnd so here,\n\n493\n00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:14.690\nif I hit Cancel, it's just gonna take\nme right back into the application.\n\n494\n00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.530\nIt's not gonna get rid of anything.\n\n495\n00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:20.760\nIt makes me click Delete instead.\n\n496\n00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.300\nAnd that's my way or their way of saying,\nwe want you to be absolutely sure that if\n\n497\n00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.670\nyou don't save this you\nunderstand that it's going away.\n\n498\n00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:31.310\nAnd when I hit Delete,\nthat file is now gone, and\n\n499\n00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:34.370\nit doesn't matter if auto\nsave made 20 revisions of it.\n\n500\n00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:35.760\nThey're gone as well.\n\n501\n00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.850\nI chose to delete it, it's gone.\n\n502\n00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:39.498\nI can't get that document back.\n\n503\n00:27:39.498 --> 00:27:43.860\nSo auto save can't reinvent data\nif you told it to be deleted, and\n\n504\n00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:44.730\nyou never saved it.\n\n505\n00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.630\nThat's one thing that it can't do.\n\n506\n00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:50.640\nBut as long as you've saved it at least\nonce, you'll see those previous versions,\n\n507\n00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.840\nyou'll be able to get a lot of the data.\n\n508\n00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.580\nAnother thing worth mentioning\nhere is that auto save depends\n\n509\n00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.400\non the MAC OS extended journal or\nthe APFS File Systems.\n\n510\n00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.030\nIt's effectively using Time Machine and\n\n511\n00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.460\nTime Machine requires\nan Apple File System.\n\n512\n00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.360\nSo if your files are stored on\na fat 32 disk, or x fat, NTFS,\n\n513\n00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.060\nsome other file system, you're not\ngonna have this functionality either.\n\n514\n00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:13.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n515\n00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:15.640\nif it's saved on your MAC you're fine.\n\n516\n00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.640\nIf it's external media, it needs to be\nformatted with an Apple file system and\n\n517\n00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.220\nthen you'll be fine there as well.\n\n518\n00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.100\nBut as long as that's in place,\nobviously it's gonna do its job and\n\n519\n00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.400\nyou don't have to worry\nabout anything anymore.\n\n520\n00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.800\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful episode Don.\n\n521\n00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.415\nI need an auto save for my memory.\n\n522\n00:28:29.415 --> 00:28:31.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Application Data part two,\n\n523\n00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.250\nthere was a part one\nmake sure you see that.\n\n524\n00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.370\nBefore we move on, Don,\nanything else you would like to say?\n\n525\n00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:37.510\n&gt;&gt; That's about it.\n\n526\n00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.910\nWe've been focused on application data and\n\n527\n00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:43.390\nI know quick look and auto save\nare a little bit tangential to that, but\n\n528\n00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.130\nit's kind of neat features to\nsee built right into the system.\n\n529\n00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:47.600\nBut that's basically it for\n\n530\n00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.530\nthose, we're gonna move on to\nthe other topics after this episode.\n\n531\n00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:55.320\nBut it is nice to be aware of those little\nfeatures in the background that most\n\n532\n00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.510\npeople aren't even aware of.\n\n533\n00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:57.140\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n534\n00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:01.790\nNow make sure you see every episode of\nApple's Certified Support Professional.\n\n535\n00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.090\nDon's done a great job putting\nall of that together for you.\n\n536\n00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:07.490\nIt will help you, and you'll be in the\ncourse library where there's thousands of\n\n537\n00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.200\nother videos that are there\nto help you go further.\n\n538\n00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.670\nSo check those out too.\n\n539\n00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.750\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n540\n00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.670\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n541\n00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:17.290\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n542\n00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:18.070\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don

thank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n4\n00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.081\nI'm Zach Memos,\n\n5\n00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:20.740\nyour host with this episode of Apple\ncertified support professional.\n\n6\n00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.090\nAnd we're gonna be looking at\napplication support part one.\n\n7\n00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.390\nMiss curious, how many parts?\n\n8\n00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.920\nYou have to stay tuned to find out.\n\n9\n00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.750\nAnd the person bringing all these\ninformation we need is one and only,\n\n10\n00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.300\nDon Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.430\nDon, good to see you sir.\n\n12\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.720\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be back, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.940\nAnd yet like he said we're gonna\nbe jumping in application support.\n\n14\n00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.920\nThe reason we don't know how many parts.\n\n15\n00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.830\nParts is, what we are gonna be focusing on\nthis episode are all the weird little ons\n\n16\n00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.670\nand ins that come into change the way that\napplications can behave and as you expect,\n\n17\n00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.500\nthere's a lot of weird little bits and\nsubject matter that we need to be\n\n18\n00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.310\naware of that make it were not every\napplication runs the same way.\n\n19\n00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.600\nSo for example, we're going to talk\nabout applications that use Java,\n\n20\n00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.310\nwe'll talk about 32-bit and\n64-bit applications.\n\n21\n00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.160\nWe'll talk about other\nsandbox applications and\n\n22\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.090\nall these really weird quirks that\nif you don't know about them,\n\n23\n00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.670\nit makes it really hard to understand\nwhy one application behaves one way and\n\n24\n00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.590\nwhy another application behaves\nin an entirely different way.\n\n25\n00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.010\nIt's super frustrating.\n\n26\n00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.690\nSo we're gonna go through each\nof these and highlight them.\n\n27\n00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.980\nNow, understand that everything we're\nabout to talk about in this episode and\n\n28\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.470\nthe other parts of it are edge\ncases that 90% of the time, and\n\n29\n00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.150\nI'm totally make that statistic up,\napplications are gonna run a particular.\n\n30\n00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.160\nThey're gonna behave like normal.\n\n31\n00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.000\nAnd that's fine.\n\n32\n00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.450\nThat's what we want but when things\ngo really weird, I want you to have\n\n33\n00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.120\na collection of scenarios that you can\nsay, you know what, I know what that is.\n\n34\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.460\nI've seen that before.\n\n35\n00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.410\nThis application has this special need and\nthat makes it behave differently.\n\n36\n00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.550\nSo that's what we're gonna be taking\na look at in this little series.\n\n37\n00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.550\n&gt;&gt; So Don, why are Java applications\ndifferent than normal apps?\n\n38\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.060\n&gt;&gt; Java was the first\none that I mentioned and\n\n39\n00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.085\nthe main reason is because Java's weird.\n\n40\n00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:05.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As a platform, it's very strange.\n\n41\n00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.850\nIt was, It was a really good idea.\n\n42\n00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.140\nDo you ever have one of those?\n\n43\n00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.960\nIt was a good idea at the time,\nand now you kind of regret it.\n\n44\n00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.330\nAnd your life is now a series of mistakes.\n\n45\n00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.550\n&gt;&gt; I have a lot of those.\n\n46\n00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.103\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So Java is one of those,\nit was a great idea at the time, right.\n\n47\n00:02:21.103 --> 00:02:25.037\nSo what happened was there was a company\ncalled Sun Microsystems and at Sun,\n\n48\n00:02:25.037 --> 00:02:25.989\nthey had this idea.\n\n49\n00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.064\nThey said, man, when somebody writes a\nprogram, they either have to write it for\n\n50\n00:02:30.064 --> 00:02:33.970\nWindows, or they write it for\nMac, or they write it for Unix.\n\n51\n00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.830\nBut if they want it to run on all three,\n\n52\n00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.540\nthey basically have to\nrewrite the program.\n\n53\n00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.770\nWrite it three different times,\nthree different platforms.\n\n54\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.570\nAnd they saw a future where there\nwere more than three platforms.\n\n55\n00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.440\nMobile phones, tablets,\n\n56\n00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.310\nall these different things,\ndifferent operating systems.\n\n57\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.350\nIt was a nightmare to do\napplication development.\n\n58\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.900\nAnd so all the apps are being\ndeveloped on windows\n\n59\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.480\nbecause it was the most common operating\nsystem that's what was happening, so\n\n60\n00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.010\nif you run a Mac in the nineteen\neighties and nineteen nineties\n\n61\n00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.330\nyou didn't have a ton of software to pick\nfrom, and if you were in Unix you had even\n\n62\n00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.440\nless software to pick from, so that was\nkind of holding those platforms back.\n\n63\n00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.000\nSo at Johnny they said,\nwhat f we did this?\n\n64\n00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.400\nWhat if we created a runtime engine?\n\n65\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.060\nAnd the runtime engine, we can create\na runtime engine that runs on Mac and\n\n66\n00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.020\na runtime engine that runs on Windows and\n\n67\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.710\nruntimes Unix and\nwe can write 20 different runtime engines.\n\n68\n00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.730\nAnd then people can write their\napplications in this new language\n\n69\n00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.870\ncalled Java.\n\n70\n00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.280\nAnd they write the application one time.\n\n71\n00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.590\nAnd it's just expecting a runtime engine.\n\n72\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.740\nAnd as long as it finds that engine,\nit will run and it will work.\n\n73\n00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.580\nThat makes it where a developer can create\none app that can run on every platform.\n\n74\n00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.880\nMobile, desktop, Windows,\nMac, Unix, you name it.\n\n75\n00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.010\nEven old crazy OS's that nobody\nruns anymore like OS2 or BeOS or\n\n76\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.639\nsomething like that.\n\n77\n00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.680\nYou can run job applications.\n\n78\n00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.420\nSo sounds like a great idea.\n\n79\n00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.260\nHey, if I'm a developer, I just write\none application instead of one for\n\n80\n00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.650\neach platform.\n\n81\n00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.010\nThe problem is,\nthat runtime engine is really complex.\n\n82\n00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.770\nAnd Sun Microsystems,\nthey put a lot of effort into it,\n\n83\n00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.440\nthey try to keep it stable and consistent,\nBut ultimately, Oracle bought Sun and\n\n84\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.270\nso now it's Oracle's product and\nOracle's neglected it pretty bad.\n\n85\n00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.190\nSo it has a number of security\nvulnerabilities, a number of other\n\n86\n00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.310\nweaknesses inside of the engine that Make\nit somewhat dangerous, in some cases.\n\n87\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.874\nRight?\n\n88\n00:04:30.874 --> 00:04:32.001\nSo many people,\n\n89\n00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:36.992\nmyself included are at the point where\nwe don't want to use java anymore.\n\n90\n00:04:36.992 --> 00:04:38.441\nActively resist it.\n\n91\n00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:42.304\nLike, I try not not to install\njava support on my laptop or\n\n92\n00:04:42.304 --> 00:04:44.630\nmy desktop if I ca avoid it.\n\n93\n00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.730\nI have to have an application that\nspecifically requires Java in order for\n\n94\n00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.240\nme to have it loaded, and I'll typically\nput that in a virtual machine or\n\n95\n00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.370\nisolate it somehow, so I'm not running it.\n\n96\n00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.760\nThat's all kind of stuff that happened\nwith Java when it was being created, and\n\n97\n00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.390\ndeveloped, and put in place.\n\n98\n00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.880\nSo it was a great idea, but it just\ndidn't stand up to the test of time.\n\n99\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.000\nAnd now, hey now Macs have\nbeen gaining market share and\n\n100\n00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.110\nyou've got tons of software to pick from.\n\n101\n00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.920\nAnd most applications have\ngone web-based anyway, so\n\n102\n00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.965\nwhen you When you look at Facebook and\nGmail, Icloud for that matter.\n\n103\n00:05:20.965 --> 00:05:24.475\nThey're web based products, so it doesn't\nmatter what operating system your on.\n\n104\n00:05:24.475 --> 00:05:26.805\nThe web browsers more important.\n\n105\n00:05:26.805 --> 00:05:30.315\nSo that landscape has changed a lot.\n\n106\n00:05:30.315 --> 00:05:32.905\nAnd that's kind of weakened\nthe way the java is.\n\n107\n00:05:32.905 --> 00:05:37.815\nBut hopefully, that little diatribe\nI went on there explains one thing.\n\n108\n00:05:37.815 --> 00:05:40.280\nWhich is why Java\napplications are special.\n\n109\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.010\nThey're not a native binary, it's not just\na binary that I could run and it works.\n\n110\n00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.200\nI have to have a run time engine and then\n\n111\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.790\nwhen I run that application it connects\nto the engine, the engine runs it.\n\n112\n00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.810\nSo the application is made up\nof two pieces now instead of\n\n113\n00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.020\none piece like what we expect and\nthat means we can get on behavior.\n\n114\n00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.278\nWhen I get one application like Safari.\n\n115\n00:06:03.278 --> 00:06:06.040\nThere's the Safari.app bundle,\n\n116\n00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.640\nand everything Safari needs is\nright there in that bundle.\n\n117\n00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.340\nSo when it runs,\nit's gonna run a certain way.\n\n118\n00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.050\nBut with Java, you have the application\nbundle, which I call JAR, or\n\n119\n00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.840\na Java ARchive.\n\n120\n00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.130\nSo you have the JAR, and\nthen you have the Runtime Engine.\n\n121\n00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.300\nWell, what if the JAR was made for\nRuntime Engine 7,\n\n122\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.670\nAnd you actually have run time\nengine eight or six for that matter.\n\n123\n00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.580\nYou can have variations like that\nbecause they're not bundled together,\n\n124\n00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.610\nthey might not match up, and now some\nparts of the application don't work, or\n\n125\n00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.940\nit crashes, or it doesn't run at all.\n\n126\n00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.380\nWho knows what's gonna happen.\n\n127\n00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.110\nIt makes things more complex, so\n\n128\n00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.400\nJava applications are harder\nto support because of that.\n\n129\n00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.540\n&gt;&gt; Well that being said,\n\n130\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.120\nwhat do we need to do to enable\nour Mac to run Java applications?\n\n131\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.160\n[LAUGH] I don't even know why\nI'm asking you, but I am.\n\n132\n00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.700\n&gt;&gt; So I sold it pretty hard right?\n\n133\n00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.040\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n134\n00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.260\n&gt;&gt; But\nlets say that you go into your office, and\n\n135\n00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:08.070\nyou're supporting a network of Macs and\n&gt;&gt; You've got some software,\n\n136\n00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.250\nsome custom-built software for\nyour company or\n\n137\n00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.820\na third-party application your company\nuses, that's built on Java, right.\n\n138\n00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.310\nAnd you don't have a choice.\n\n139\n00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.810\nYou can't say, well,\nI'm just gonna move away.\n\n140\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.180\nMaybe the software cost $1.2 million,\nright.\n\n141\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.100\nCustom software is oftentimes very,\nvery expensive.\n\n142\n00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.480\nYou can't just move away,\nso you're stuck with it.\n\n143\n00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.060\nAll right, so let's put aside all\nthe negatives and say okay, I'm stuck.\n\n144\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.090\nI've gotta do this, right, I'm locked\nin at least for a couple of years, but\n\n145\n00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.470\nhow do I make the best of this?\n\n146\n00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:41.040\nOkay, well in order for Java to work,\nyou've got to have a Java runtime engine.\n\n147\n00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.770\nAll right.\nNow, here's where things get a little bit\n\n148\n00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:44.650\nconfusing.\n\n149\n00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:50.070\nBecause there's two different run\ntime engines available for Mac OS.\n\n150\n00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.586\nThere's one from Java, which is Oracle.\n\n151\n00:07:54.586 --> 00:07:55.711\nSo there's one from Oracle.\n\n152\n00:07:55.711 --> 00:07:58.608\nThat's the official run time engine.\n\n153\n00:07:58.608 --> 00:08:00.569\nBut there's also one from Apple.\n\n154\n00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:02.704\nAll right, so what's that all about?\n\n155\n00:08:02.704 --> 00:08:07.059\nWell Apple recognized very early\non that Java was a good platform,\n\n156\n00:08:07.059 --> 00:08:11.860\nbut it wasn't gonna be long lived,\nor had already been long lived.\n\n157\n00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.030\nBut that it wasn't a long term plan, but\n\n158\n00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.780\nthat they had to have something more\nsecure than what Oracle was putting out,\n\n159\n00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.100\nbecause Oracle really wasn't\nputting out much at the time.\n\n160\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.970\nSo what Apple did is they said, look,\n\n161\n00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.950\nwe're gonna create our\nown runtime environment.\n\n162\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:32.130\nAnd Apple built a custom Java runtime\nenvironment just for Mac OS that Apple\n\n163\n00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.870\nmanaged the security for and they managed\nthe updates, and it was very stable.\n\n164\n00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.950\nThey actually did a really\ngood job with it, right?\n\n165\n00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.980\nSo now that I've said that,\nI'm kinda sold in.\n\n166\n00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.547\nYou're probably thinking, well hey,\n\n167\n00:08:44.547 --> 00:08:46.400\nwhy would I get the run\ntime engine from Oracle?\n\n168\n00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.260\n&gt;&gt; I'm waiting for it.\n\n169\n00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.380\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna get it from Apple.\n\n170\n00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:53.490\nThe problem is, a couple of years\nago Apple said, Java's dead.\n\n171\n00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.690\nAnd said we're not gonna update\nour runtime engine anymore.\n\n172\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:57.320\nAnd they haven't.\n\n173\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.260\nThey've stopped updating it, okay?\n\n174\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.730\nSo for example here, let me show you.\n\n175\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.340\nI'm gonna fire up old Safari.\n\n176\n00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.015\nHere is the article that's published for\nApple, and\n\n177\n00:09:07.015 --> 00:09:10.853\nI will put the link to this in\nthe show notes just so you can see it.\n\n178\n00:09:10.853 --> 00:09:16.390\nIf you want to go and download\nthe latest Java runtime from Apple,\n\n179\n00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:22.641\nfirst off, the update for\nit is labeled macOS 2017-001, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:22.641 --> 00:09:25.868\nThat name right there tells me,\nthis was released in 2017,\n\n181\n00:09:25.868 --> 00:09:28.040\nthis episode is being filmed in 2018.\n\n182\n00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:33.170\nAnd then 001,\nit's the first version released in 2017.\n\n183\n00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:38.250\nSo that means they released\none version in 2017.\n\n184\n00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.324\nThat's not a lot.\n\n185\n00:09:39.324 --> 00:09:39.987\n&gt;&gt; Uh-uh.\n\n186\n00:09:39.987 --> 00:09:42.645\n&gt;&gt; Could have been in January, could\nhave been in December, doesn't matter.\n\n187\n00:09:42.645 --> 00:09:44.989\nThere's only one version of it.\n\n188\n00:09:44.989 --> 00:09:48.699\nThe second thing you might\nnotice is this guy right here.\n\n189\n00:09:48.699 --> 00:09:50.571\nThis was designed for macOS Lion.\n\n190\n00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:51.556\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n191\n00:09:51.556 --> 00:09:53.699\n&gt;&gt; Not the modern OSC.\n\n192\n00:09:53.699 --> 00:09:59.770\nmacOS Lion is 10.7, or\nis actually OS 10 Lion back then, 10.7.\n\n193\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.780\nWe're on 10.13 now, right?\n\n194\n00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.927\nThis is old school stuff, right?\n\n195\n00:10:05.927 --> 00:10:10.333\nMaybe if we're filming this episode in\n2012, this would be considered current but\n\n196\n00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:11.411\nwe're in 2018.\n\n197\n00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:12.851\nThis is old school stuff, all right?\n\n198\n00:10:12.851 --> 00:10:17.355\nBut Apple has kept support for it because\nthey know that some people might have\n\n199\n00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:21.530\napplications that were designed and\nexpected this Java runtime.\n\n200\n00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:26.110\nAll right,\nnow this runtime engine is for Java 6.\n\n201\n00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.800\nJava is actually up to version eight now,\nso\n\n202\n00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.740\nif you go to Oracle's site it is\nseveral leaps and bounds ahead of this.\n\n203\n00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.050\nBut you can still install this\non macOS 10.13 High Sierra,\n\n204\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.390\nit's right there in the article.\n\n205\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.470\nYou can go and download it and install it.\n\n206\n00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.581\nAnd I will tell you,\nif you Google around right now,\n\n207\n00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:47.990\nyou'll find people in the forums\neven Apples own forum.\n\n208\n00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.808\nNot employees, but regular people saying.\n\n209\n00:10:50.808 --> 00:10:53.381\nYou definitely want to use\nApple's Java runtime engine.\n\n210\n00:10:53.381 --> 00:10:54.280\nDon't use Oracle's, okay?\n\n211\n00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.760\nLet me tell you right now,\nthose people are absolutely wrong.\n\n212\n00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.260\n100% wrong.\n\n213\n00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.690\nYou do not want to run this\nunless you absolutely have to.\n\n214\n00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:07.180\nYou have some applications that\nspecifically depends just on this.\n\n215\n00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.570\nSo while Apple does still publish\ntheir Java runtime engine,\n\n216\n00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.310\nyou don't wanna use it, all right?\n\n217\n00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:18.630\nIt does have security flaws in it\nthat have not been patched, and Apple\n\n218\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:24.250\nkilled this off years ago, so you're lucky\nthey've even released one update in 2017.\n\n219\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.250\nThey're not committed to\nproviding security updates here,\n\n220\n00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.600\nthis should be a last resort type thing.\n\n221\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.170\nLike I have to do this to run this\none application this one time and\n\n222\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.660\nthen when I'm done I'm gonna uninstall.\n\n223\n00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.110\nThat type of thing.\n\n224\n00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.710\nBut if you go to Oracle's website.\n\n225\n00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.062\nIf just go to java.com.\n\n226\n00:11:41.062 --> 00:11:43.358\nJ-A-V-A.com.\n\n227\n00:11:43.358 --> 00:11:45.802\nWhen you go to Java's website,\nthey got where you can go in and\n\n228\n00:11:45.802 --> 00:11:47.140\nyou can download it, all right?\n\n229\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.187\nNow when you download from Oracle, they're\ngonna offer to give you Java 1.8 or\n\n230\n00:11:51.187 --> 00:11:55.430\nRuntime Engine 8,\nthey leave the 1 off, but it's 1.8.\n\n231\n00:11:55.430 --> 00:12:00.950\nIf you try and\ninstall anything older than 1.8,\n\n232\n00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.130\nstarting with Mac OS Sierra,\nthey won't let you.\n\n233\n00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.998\nIt'll actually block you\ninstalling runtime 1.6.\n\n234\n00:12:06.998 --> 00:12:09.605\nSo the one that Apple\npushes out themselves,\n\n235\n00:12:09.605 --> 00:12:12.011\nthey won't let you install from Oracle.\n\n236\n00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:14.876\nIt's so old,\nit's got security vulnerabilities in it,\n\n237\n00:12:14.876 --> 00:12:17.050\nthey don't allow it on the system anymore.\n\n238\n00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.482\nAll right,\nthere is a way to override that but\n\n239\n00:12:19.482 --> 00:12:23.380\nif you do it actually breaks almost\nall of security inside of Mac OS.\n\n240\n00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.520\nIt's a terrible idea.\n\n241\n00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:30.704\nSo effectively, you cannot run Java\nruntime Engine 1.6 from Oracle.\n\n242\n00:12:30.704 --> 00:12:35.790\nAnd you really don't want to,\nyou want to run 1.8.\n\n243\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.343\nAnd with 1.8, you know,\nif we go in here and\n\n244\n00:12:38.343 --> 00:12:42.083\ntell it we wanna do the download and\nlet's see, where's the link?\n\n245\n00:12:42.083 --> 00:12:45.130\nThere's a link in here where you can\ndo all the downloads, here we go.\n\n246\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.340\nIf you dig around in here and start\nlooking at the different downloads that\n\n247\n00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.220\nare available, what you'll find is\nwhere they have runtime engines for\n\n248\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.350\nall these different operating systems.\n\n249\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:59.720\nAnd then they also have a number of\nupdates that have been released.\n\n250\n00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.460\nSo for example if I were to\ndownload this runtime engine.\n\n251\n00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.770\nI'm trying to find, right here.\n\n252\n00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:10.075\nSo this is version 8, update 161.\n\n253\n00:13:10.075 --> 00:13:14.151\nThey've put out 161 updates to version A.\n\n254\n00:13:14.151 --> 00:13:18.327\nVersus that version 6 that we saw a moment\nago, that had one update right, so\n\n255\n00:13:18.327 --> 00:13:23.100\nOracle is accurately supporting this, this\nis the platform that we wanted to install.\n\n256\n00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.998\nBut, remember what I said about\napplications, if your applications\n\n257\n00:13:27.998 --> 00:13:33.390\nspecifically says, hey I need 1.7, I need\n1.6, then 1.8 might break something.\n\n258\n00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.080\nAnd so you may have to go in and download\nthe particular version, all right?\n\n259\n00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.580\nNow there was a time, back in the day,\nso if you have an older MAC,\n\n260\n00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.580\nwhere Java was prepackaged,\nit was already installed by default.\n\n261\n00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.010\nAnd that ship has sailed.\n\n262\n00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:47.810\nIt's not there.\n\n263\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.070\nBut you can test it.\n\n264\n00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.172\nIf you want to see, like hey,\n\n265\n00:13:51.172 --> 00:13:53.900\nmaybe I've already got Java\ninstalled on my machine, okay?\n\n266\n00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.890\nYou can fire up a terminal.\n\n267\n00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:03.080\nAnd in the terminal, you can just\nrun java --version, all right?\n\n268\n00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.930\nTwo dashes.\n\n269\n00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.149\nSo java --version.\n\n270\n00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:08.000\nWhen you run that, it will tell you\nwhat version of Java you're running.\n\n271\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.230\nIf you got the Apple embedded one or if\nyou have the one downloaded from Oracle,\n\n272\n00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.400\nyou can run that.\n\n273\n00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.558\nAnd it'll tell you, all right.\n\n274\n00:14:14.558 --> 00:14:18.440\nWhat does mine say, no Java runtime\npresent, requesting install.\n\n275\n00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.680\nSo I know that I don't have Java installed\non my machine, that's the way I like it.\n\n276\n00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.740\nBut I get this little popup here, and\n\n277\n00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.120\nit's just telling me, if you wanna\nuse Java you need to install the JDK.\n\n278\n00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.140\nNow, let me talk about\nJava terminology here,\n\n279\n00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.610\ncuz you're gonna see a few\ndifferent naming conventions here.\n\n280\n00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:40.440\nThe product itself is actually\ncalled Java SC, and the Java SC\n\n281\n00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.650\nis actually a whole suite of applications\nthat allow you to run other applications.\n\n282\n00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.090\nIt's kind of confusing.\n\n283\n00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:52.380\nBut inside of the Java SC, there's the\nJDK, which is the Java Development Kit.\n\n284\n00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.129\nIf you are a developer and\nyou wanna write Java applications,\n\n285\n00:14:56.129 --> 00:14:59.385\nyou need the Java Development Kit,\nthe JDK, right?\n\n286\n00:14:59.385 --> 00:15:02.217\nBut most of us aren't writing\nJava applications, right?\n\n287\n00:15:02.217 --> 00:15:03.936\nIf you're writing a Java application,\n\n288\n00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:07.181\nyou should consider writing in a different\nlanguage at this point, right?\n\n289\n00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:10.233\nIf you're running an application,\nthat's a different story, right?\n\n290\n00:15:10.233 --> 00:15:14.489\nNow you need what's called the JRE,\nor the Java Runtime Environment.\n\n291\n00:15:14.489 --> 00:15:16.860\nJRE, and that's that runtime engine\nI was talking about earlier.\n\n292\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.600\nBut in JRE that just stands for\nenvironment, so Java Runtime Environment.\n\n293\n00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.063\nSo when I go to download this,\nI could download the JDK but\n\n294\n00:15:24.063 --> 00:15:26.819\nit's got a bunch of\nstuff that I don't need.\n\n295\n00:15:26.819 --> 00:15:30.179\nThe JRE, that's what I actually\nwant to do the download.\n\n296\n00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:33.956\nNow if I say OK, this window just\ngoes away and nothing happens.\n\n297\n00:15:33.956 --> 00:15:37.039\n&gt;&gt; So Don, what happens if you ask for\nmore info and you click on more info?\n\n298\n00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:39.493\n&gt;&gt; So it does what it says,\nand give you more information.\n\n299\n00:15:39.493 --> 00:15:40.237\n&gt;&gt; Yay [LAUGH].\n\n300\n00:15:40.237 --> 00:15:40.942\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't install.\n\n301\n00:15:40.942 --> 00:15:42.428\nIt's not actually giving\nus a choice to install.\n\n302\n00:15:42.428 --> 00:15:45.165\nThat's what I always thought was\ninteresting, is you click OK,\n\n303\n00:15:45.165 --> 00:15:46.137\ndoesn't install.\n\n304\n00:15:46.137 --> 00:15:47.801\nClick more info, doesn't install.\n\n305\n00:15:47.801 --> 00:15:50.152\nSo Apple's not giving\nyou a way to install it,\n\n306\n00:15:50.152 --> 00:15:53.303\nthey're just giving you a way\nto know that you don't have it.\n\n307\n00:15:53.303 --> 00:15:56.036\nSo by clicking it, it really just takes me\nto that Java.com webpage that I showed you\n\n308\n00:15:56.036 --> 00:15:56.659\nguys a moment ago.\n\n309\n00:15:56.659 --> 00:15:57.275\nWhich.\n\n310\n00:15:57.275 --> 00:15:58.636\nIf we want to run through that.\n\n311\n00:15:58.636 --> 00:15:59.931\nHere, I'll just clear out of that.\n\n312\n00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:01.770\nJump back to our Java page.\n\n313\n00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.750\nWhen you go to Java.com,\n\n314\n00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:09.080\nit's going to basically bring this page up\nwhere you can do the free Java download.\n\n315\n00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.620\nNow, quick word of caution here.\n\n316\n00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.350\nI'm in Safari.\n\n317\n00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.340\nSo, this is gonna work just fine.\n\n318\n00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.050\nI don't normally run Safari though.\n\n319\n00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.270\nI normally use Google Chrome or Firefox.\n\n320\n00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:23.076\nThose applications, don't care so much for\nJAVA these days and so, when they come to\n\n321\n00:16:23.076 --> 00:16:27.684\nthe JAVA website, or let you provide us\nsuddenly different downloader for them.\n\n322\n00:16:27.684 --> 00:16:31.827\nA downloader that's providing JAVA\nfunctionality for the web browser.\n\n323\n00:16:31.827 --> 00:16:36.704\nBut when we're trying applications running\nin our machine, we're not talking about\n\n324\n00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:41.300\nweb browser applications [INAUDIBLE]\nJAVA applications on our system, And so\n\n325\n00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.450\nwe need the Java environment for\nour own machine.\n\n326\n00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:48.790\nIf you're using Chrome and you come here\nand you do the download and install Java\n\n327\n00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:53.970\nand then drop to a terminal and\nrun Java version.\n\n328\n00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.650\nYou'll likely get this same screen that\npops up because you installed the runtime\n\n329\n00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.240\nengine just for the Chrome browser,\nnot for the operating system.\n\n330\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.850\nSo be careful with that.\n\n331\n00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.470\nWhen you come in here to do the download,\nif you just hit agree and\n\n332\n00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:11.130\nstart free download, it's usually\ngoing to download the one that's for\n\n333\n00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:16.110\nyour web browser, whatever web browser\nyou happen to be in right then, okay.\n\n334\n00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:21.390\nWith Safari, it actually says it\nrecognizes that it wants to do the one for\n\n335\n00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.350\nthe operating system.\n\n336\n00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:24.720\nSo it's telling me that it's\ngonna load the right one.\n\n337\n00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.680\nBut if you're in Chrome or\nwhatever it might not.\n\n338\n00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.010\nIf you want to avoid that or\nensure that you get the right download.\n\n339\n00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.020\nYou can, instead of hitting that agree,\nyou can scroll down a bit and\n\n340\n00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.390\nyou'll see the see all\nJava downloads link?\n\n341\n00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.910\nAnd when you choose that, you'll see\nevery download that's available including\n\n342\n00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:46.560\nthe Windows installer, the Mac OS\ninstaller, Linux, Solaris, each of these.\n\n343\n00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.170\nAnd they usually come in two forms,\nan offline and an online.\n\n344\n00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.700\nThe online one is a very small\nfile that connects up and\n\n345\n00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:59.130\ndownloads the stuff from Oracle servers.\n\n346\n00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.530\nThe offline window has the full\nJava suite inside of it.\n\n347\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.510\nAnd under macOS, I can see it right here,\nfor 10.7.3 and above,\n\n348\n00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.700\ntalking about the OS, not Java.\n\n349\n00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.065\nBut it's got in it 74 megs of\nIn size not terribly large.\n\n350\n00:18:13.065 --> 00:18:14.995\nBut I can choose that, download it.\n\n351\n00:18:14.995 --> 00:18:18.985\nSo far is gonna download that away and\nas soon that's done.\n\n352\n00:18:18.985 --> 00:18:20.125\nI'll be able to install.\n\n353\n00:18:20.125 --> 00:18:23.495\nAnd so it should download pretty quick.\n\n354\n00:18:23.495 --> 00:18:27.355\nAnd here we go, so\nit's a standard DMG file.\n\n355\n00:18:27.355 --> 00:18:32.350\nNow the Java runtime engine\nis a special application.\n\n356\n00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.846\nIt's not a program itself.\n\n357\n00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:37.022\nI don't just drag it and\ndrop it in the applications folder.\n\n358\n00:18:37.022 --> 00:18:38.330\nIt's a package, a pkg.\n\n359\n00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.883\nSo it has to install itself\ninside of the system.\n\n360\n00:18:40.883 --> 00:18:43.121\nAnd so\nif I want to do that I have to run this.\n\n361\n00:18:43.121 --> 00:18:47.360\nIt's going to give me a little warning\nhere about this application because it's\n\n362\n00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.848\ngoing to be changing files that\nwe don't normally have access to.\n\n363\n00:18:50.848 --> 00:18:53.450\nI'm going to say that's okay.\n\n364\n00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.710\nAnd I'll provide my credentials\nto allow Java to install.\n\n365\n00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:03.510\nAnd now I get welcome to\nthe Java 8 update 161 installer.\n\n366\n00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.790\nBy the time you watch this episode\nit might be update 165, right.\n\n367\n00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.770\nThese things change and\n\n368\n00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.560\nthat's another important thing\nthat once this is installed.\n\n369\n00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.500\nGetting it installed isn't enough,\nyou gotta keep it updated.\n\n370\n00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.560\nSo it's gonna ask me, in a moment,\nor at least, it should ask me.\n\n371\n00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.390\nNo, it didn't.\n\n372\n00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.730\nAbout how I wanna update Java.\n\n373\n00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.520\nAnd, you know it didn't ask, hang on,\nit's launching all these web browsers now.\n\n374\n00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.810\nLet me just get out of those.\n\n375\n00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.340\nAnd it didn't ask about update.\n\n376\n00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.400\nSo normally, it asks about how you want\nto keep this updated and you can tell it,\n\n377\n00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.988\nhey, I want you to automatically\nupdate it or whatever.\n\n378\n00:19:36.988 --> 00:19:41.190\nWell, what will happen is you\ngo into your system preferences,\n\n379\n00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.340\nyou'll find a new system\npreference here for\n\n380\n00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.290\nJava because Java is not a program\nintended to be run by itself.\n\n381\n00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.140\nIf I go to my applications folder,\nI don't have a Java icon there.\n\n382\n00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.300\nBut in my system preferences I do and\nif I go into that,\n\n383\n00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.672\nit's gonna launch the Java Control Panel,\nslowly, and\n\n384\n00:19:56.672 --> 00:20:00.817\nwhen I get into the Java Control Panel,\nthen I've got an update tab and\n\n385\n00:20:00.817 --> 00:20:04.681\nhere's where we can tell it to check for\nupdates automatically.\n\n386\n00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:07.561\nLooks like I guess Oracle\nchanged their policy.\n\n387\n00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:10.584\nNow they just force you to\nupdate automatically and\n\n388\n00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:13.480\nlet you uncheck that Let me tell\nyou that's a good idea though.\n\n389\n00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.090\nYou want it to automatically update.\n\n390\n00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.610\nThey put out a lot of updates.\n\n391\n00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.730\nThere are security vulnerabilities\nin Java that can be really bad.\n\n392\n00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.320\nImagine you're browsing\nthe web in a web browser.\n\n393\n00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.740\nYou hit a web page that has\nan embedded Java application in it and\n\n394\n00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:31.260\nit exploits some flaw in the Java engine\nand now your system's compromised.\n\n395\n00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.460\nIt can happen just by visiting a web page.\n\n396\n00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.990\nThat's why web browsers like\nGoogle Chrome block Java by default And\n\n397\n00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.660\nyou have to enable that.\n\n398\n00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:42.610\nSo again, we don't want to run this\nplatform if we are gonna avoid it.\n\n399\n00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:47.340\nBut if we have it is there\nwe can take advantage of it.\n\n400\n00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.181\nNow I think I have to reboot\nbefore that utility will show up.\n\n401\n00:20:51.181 --> 00:20:55.081\nLet me open up another\nterminal window here and\n\n402\n00:20:55.081 --> 00:20:58.689\nsee if Java-- version is working for me.\n\n403\n00:20:58.689 --> 00:20:59.894\nNot yet, all right.\n\n404\n00:20:59.894 --> 00:21:03.285\nSo I'll need to reboot before that one\ncomes in because it's changed some paths\n\n405\n00:21:03.285 --> 00:21:04.053\nin binary files.\n\n406\n00:21:04.053 --> 00:21:06.895\nBut as soon as that's done then I'll\nbe able to query that version and\n\n407\n00:21:06.895 --> 00:21:08.814\nI'll be able to run\napplications using that.\n\n408\n00:21:08.814 --> 00:21:11.685\nBut that's basically the process\nof getting it installed.\n\n409\n00:21:11.685 --> 00:21:13.427\nKeeping it updated is a big deal.\n\n410\n00:21:13.427 --> 00:21:14.485\nBig lesson here is,\n\n411\n00:21:14.485 --> 00:21:18.570\nwhile Apple does have their own version\nof Java, You don't wanna use it anymore.\n\n412\n00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.990\nIt's too outdated, and it's just there for\n\n413\n00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:25.600\nbackwards compatibility when you\nhave a specific need for that.\n\n414\n00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.121\n&gt;&gt; All of that for a cup of coffee.\n\n415\n00:21:27.121 --> 00:21:32.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Are there any other special\napplications we should be aware of, Doug?\n\n416\n00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.420\nThere are tons.\n\n417\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.610\nLooking at the clock, I don't have a ton\nof time, so let me pick an easy one here.\n\n418\n00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:37.800\nJava was a big one, right?\n\n419\n00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.829\nThat's a whole big can of worms there.\n\n420\n00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.950\nICloud is another one.\n\n421\n00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:47.600\nNormal applications are starting\nto depend on iCloud for\n\n422\n00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.520\ntheir storage, for their documents,\nand things like that.\n\n423\n00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.000\nSo when you install Mac OS or\n\n424\n00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.050\nyou log in the first time, it asks you if\nyou want to connect an iCloud account.\n\n425\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:01.363\nAnd if you don't, you say no I'll skip it,\nwhich I usually you do, if you skip it,\n\n426\n00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:05.141\nthere are some applications that might\nnot be to happy about that right.\n\n427\n00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:08.831\nIcloud is becoming more and more\nintegrated for all sorts of stuff, for\n\n428\n00:22:08.831 --> 00:22:12.103\nsynchronizing your messages,\nyour facetime and all of that.\n\n429\n00:22:12.103 --> 00:22:15.280\nBut also applications settings.\n\n430\n00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.470\nApplication preferences even\non your iPhone or iPad,\n\n431\n00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.760\nIOS can store them in the iCloud.\n\n432\n00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.650\nMac OS can as well.\n\n433\n00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.010\nIn your finder, I've changed mine so,\nI don't see it.\n\n434\n00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:30.960\nBut, in your finder\npreferences you'll find where\n\n435\n00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.750\nin the side bar iCloud is\nactually displaced by default.\n\n436\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.340\nFor people, I've turned it off of mine cuz\nI don't try to use it if I can avoid it.\n\n437\n00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:42.980\nBut, if you turn it out,\nyou'll see your iCloud storage show up.\n\n438\n00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.260\nSo back here I can see my iCloud\nDrive is not showing up and\n\n439\n00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.410\ninside of the iCloud Drive.\n\n440\n00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:52.330\nI see files for\nvarious applications like Pixelmator.\n\n441\n00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:56.240\nIt's image editing software\nkinda like poor man's Photoshop.\n\n442\n00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.740\nSo I got Pixelmator it's\nstoring its documents here.\n\n443\n00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.810\nWhat they are not showing is that in\naddition to storing documents here.\n\n444\n00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.683\nLike here's a Keynote slide that\nI made showing VPN networks.\n\n445\n00:23:07.683 --> 00:23:11.409\nSo, in addition to that,\nthere's hidden folders in here.\n\n446\n00:23:11.409 --> 00:23:15.280\nFolders that aren't just hidden\nlike you can't see them, but\n\n447\n00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.810\nhidden where you're actually\nprohibited from getting to them.\n\n448\n00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:25.000\nProtected storage,\nyou may have applications that they need\n\n449\n00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.840\nto store password information or\nsecure data banking information.\n\n450\n00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.240\nThey can create a secure folder\ninside of the iCloud drive,\n\n451\n00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.700\nthat you are absolutely\nprohibited to get to.\n\n452\n00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.060\nAnd if that's the case, then you won't\nbe able to browse and see them, but\n\n453\n00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.710\nthey do exist.\n\n454\n00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:44.910\nAnd so\nyou may need to connect an iCloud account,\n\n455\n00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.450\neven if you're not saving\nyour documents there.\n\n456\n00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:50.550\nYou might say I don't save my stuff\nin iCloud, maybe you use Dropbox or\n\n457\n00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.250\nsome competitor, right.\n\n458\n00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.310\nBut if you have an application\nfrom the Apple app store or\n\n459\n00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:59.570\nsome third party that depends on\niCloud for synchronization support.\n\n460\n00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:03.360\nYou may need to go ahead and sign in with\niCloud and get that set up and if you\n\n461\n00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.340\nhaven't done it already just remember\nyou go into your system preferences and\n\n462\n00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.510\nyou've got the iCloud icon right there.\n\n463\n00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.260\nYou can jump in and sign on and\n\n464\n00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.810\nif you dont want to use all the other\nfeatures you can leave them turned off and\n\n465\n00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:16.880\njust have storage turned on or however\nit is that you want to go about that.\n\n466\n00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.760\nIt's all kind of tucked\naway right in there.\n\n467\n00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.410\nBut that's basically another requirement\nwe're starting to see in more and\n\n468\n00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.660\nmore applications.\n\n469\n00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.780\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic,\nwell this has been a great episode,\n\n470\n00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:30.010\nthere's gonna be more in\napplication support rather and Don,\n\n471\n00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.390\nanything else you'd like\nto say before we move on?\n\n472\n00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.760\nWe've touched on two\nweird applications now.\n\n473\n00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.970\nSo we talked about applications\nthat depend on Java and\n\n474\n00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.310\nwe talked about applications\nthat depend on iCloud.\n\n475\n00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.350\nWe've got a lot more to talk about though,\n\n476\n00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:47.320\n32 bit versus 64 bit apps and\nsome other quirks like security sandboxes.\n\n477\n00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.350\nThose are all gonna come up in part two\nhopefully we can get it done in there,\n\n478\n00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.530\nif not in part three.\n\n479\n00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:52.940\nSo stay tuned for those and\n\n480\n00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.680\nwe'll see more application out\nof these in those episodes.\n\n481\n00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.720\n&gt;&gt; Well done sir and in fact, Don has\ndone a terrific job putting together\n\n482\n00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.530\nApple Certified Support Professional,\nthe whole series.\n\n483\n00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:02.850\nEvery episode's fantastic.\n\n484\n00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:03.880\nMake sure you watch them all.\n\n485\n00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.700\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n486\n00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.220\nYou'll be in the course library,\n\n487\n00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:09.870\nwhere there's thousands of other videos\nthat are there to help you go further.\n\n488\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.330\nSo check those out as well.\n\n489\n00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.480\nAnd tell everyone you know about ITProTV.\n\n490\n00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.010\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n491\n00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:15.730\nThanks for

00:00:13.242\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:16.810\nchoosing ITPro.TV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n5\n00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.681\nI'm your host,\n\n6\n00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:21.548\nZach Memos with this episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional and\n\n7\n00:00:21.548 --> 00:00:23.950\nthis is application support part two.\n\n8\n00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.915\nAnd bringing us all the information\nis the one and only, Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:30.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like that, very dramatic.\n\n10\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.605\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was just thinking,\n\n11\n00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:37.500\nwe need to film this in 3D, because we\nneed the whole part two thing [INAUDIBLE].\n\n12\n00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.600\nSo we are continuing our adventure\ninto application support.\n\n13\n00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.767\nIn the first episode, we talked\na bit about Java applications and\n\n14\n00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:49.120\nwe talked a bit about\napplications that use iCloud.\n\n15\n00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.331\nNow, I wanna talk a little bit about\napplications that are using voice\n\n16\n00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:53.662\nassistance.\n\n17\n00:00:53.662 --> 00:00:56.340\nThis is a buzzword,\nit's a big trend right now.\n\n18\n00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.000\nWe've got Siri and\nother things that are becoming more and\n\n19\n00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.290\nmore ingrained into the system.\n\n20\n00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.580\nIn my opinion, becoming more and\n\n21\n00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.318\nmore annoying with each given day.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:01:03.318 --> 00:01:04.670\n&gt;&gt; But many [LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.600\npeople love this stuff,\nwe're not gonna see it go away.\n\n24\n00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.390\nSo as\nan Apple Certified Support Professional,\n\n25\n00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.070\nyou're likely find yourself in a situation\nyou have to support voice assistance and\n\n26\n00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.290\nugly enough there's not just one,\nthere's not just two.\n\n27\n00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.290\nThere are three different voice\nengines built into macOS,\n\n28\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.500\nbecause God forbid,\nwe settled on one platform.\n\n29\n00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.370\nSo when you are out there in the field and\nyou hear somebody talking to their laptop.\n\n30\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.030\nYou don't necessarily know which of\nthe three engines they are working with.\n\n31\n00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.890\nSo I want to walk you\nthrough each of those.\n\n32\n00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.650\nShow you how they work and to help you to\nhopefully select which one makes the most\n\n33\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.900\nsense for what you are trying to do.\n&gt;&gt; Does Siri power all the voice\n\n34\n00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.970\ninteractions with the macOS?\n&gt;&gt; You'd think it would, right?\n\n35\n00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.070\nYou'd think, all right, Apple has got\nSiri, this platform they are invested in.\n\n36\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.900\nThey've got these three different engines,\n\n37\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.980\nsurely it's all powered by\nthe Siri system, but it isn't.\n\n38\n00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.330\nIn fact, Siri is the only thing\npowered by the Siri system.\n\n39\n00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.010\nThe other two engines are older stuff and\nthat's really what this all comes down to,\n\n40\n00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.450\nis that Apple has been doing voice\nstuff for a long, long time.\n\n41\n00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.540\nThey just didn't put the marketing\nteam behind it until\n\n42\n00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.200\nthey started the Siri project.\n\n43\n00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.588\nSiri was actually its own separate\ncompany that Apple acquired.\n\n44\n00:02:16.588 --> 00:02:18.730\nThey bought that company and\nbrought it in.\n\n45\n00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.950\nSo they had their own voice platform,\npowered by a completely\n\n46\n00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.090\nseparate technology, and they're\nnot going back and retrofitting it.\n\n47\n00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.710\nBut at the same time,\nthey're not taking Siri and\n\n48\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.190\nreplacing all the features\nof the other platform.\n\n49\n00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.060\nSo we can't just say, Siri is the way of\nthe future, that's what I'm gonna use.\n\n50\n00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.780\nBecause Siri doesn't do\nmuch on the desktop.\n\n51\n00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.040\nOn the phone, it does a lot, right?\n\n52\n00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.810\nAnd in an iPad it does a lot.\n\n53\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.900\nBut in macOS,\nSiri is actually pretty limited.\n\n54\n00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.550\nSo let me just give you\nthe quick Siri tour.\n\n55\n00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.214\nIf you've installed macOS 10.14\nHigh Sierra, during the install,\n\n56\n00:02:55.214 --> 00:02:57.320\nit asks you if you wanted to use Siri or\nnot.\n\n57\n00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.930\nNow, I'm a little anti-computer.\n\n58\n00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.510\nI think I watched the terminator\nmovies a few many times.\n\n59\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.880\nSo, I refuse to talk to my computer,\nit makes me angry.\n\n60\n00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.580\nSo, I told her that I'm on Siri,\nbut you can turn it on really easy.\n\n61\n00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.480\nIf we go into our System Preferences,\ninside of our System Preferences,\n\n62\n00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.050\nyou've got a Siri icon, right there it is.\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n63\n00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.280\n&gt;&gt; If you turned it on during the setup\n\n64\n00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.990\nthe Siri icon is already displayed up\nin your Menu bar, I didn't turn it on.\n\n65\n00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.970\nSo if I come in here and\nI pull up that system preference,\n\n66\n00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.600\nI can see, Enable Ask Siri,\nI turn that on.\n\n67\n00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.130\nThe first thing it warns me about is,\nhey, we can turn it on for\n\n68\n00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.970\nyou or you can cancel.\n\n69\n00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.760\nYou can turn back, it's not too late.\n\n70\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.270\nBecause when you don't understand\nSiri privacy, all right?\n\n71\n00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.970\nHow does Siri work?\n\n72\n00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.000\nYou say something, I apologize to\neverybody who's always on a phone.\n\n73\n00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.015\nI probably triggered your Siri phone\nlike 20 times in this episode.\n\n74\n00:03:47.015 --> 00:03:47.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n75\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.070\n&gt;&gt; But when you say something like, Siri,\n\n76\n00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.810\nwhen is Samuel Jackson's birthday?\n\n77\n00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.530\nAnd then it will look that up and\nfigure it out for you, right?\n\n78\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.820\nWell, the way it does that is,\nit takes your voice.\n\n79\n00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.770\nIt encodes it as a fingerprint\nof what you were asking and\n\n80\n00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.870\nthen it sends it to Apple servers.\n\n81\n00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.260\nAnd Apple servers do the lookup,\nfind the answer and send it back to you,\n\n82\n00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.800\nand then it's played on your speakers.\n\n83\n00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.300\nSo whatever you ask is\nbeing sent to Apple.\n\n84\n00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.820\nIf you work in a secure environment, if\nyou work on materials that are considered\n\n85\n00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.870\ntop secret, you're not allowed to\nhave a voice assistant like this.\n\n86\n00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.460\nIt needs to be turned off, so\nthat's why it gives you a warning here.\n\n87\n00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.400\nBut if we turn it on, now,\nit's gonna start listening, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.540\nAnd it's saying, Show Siri in menu bar.\n\n89\n00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.740\nIf I look up top,\nI've now got that Siri icon, right here.\n\n90\n00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.420\nAnd that would have been displayed\nby default if I turned it on\n\n91\n00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.220\nduring the install, right?\n\n92\n00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.460\nNow, how do we activate it on an iPhone or\n\n93\n00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.550\non an iPad, it can be in\nlistening mode which is listening.\n\n94\n00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.840\nIt's waiting for you to say,\nhey, Siri, right?\n\n95\n00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.540\nOr you can double tap the home button,\nsorry, hold the home button.\n\n96\n00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.580\nYou hold the home button down for a moment\nand then it will eventually trigger Siri.\n\n97\n00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.180\nOn the desktop, whoops, you have\nkeyboard shortcuts that you can use.\n\n98\n00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.750\nAnd so you can tell hey,\nI'm gonna Hold Command Space,\n\n99\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.110\nif I hold those two key, triggers Siri,\nI'm gonna ask to get something, all right?\n\n100\n00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.840\nBut you can drop the down,\nyou have a few other options like,\n\n101\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.480\nPress Fn (Function) Space,\nor even Customize.\n\n102\n00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.970\nWhat you wanna do, I leave my Command and\nSpace right now to be able to trigger it.\n\n103\n00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.790\nAnd then it can give you voice\nfeedback and help you out.\n\n104\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.200\nIt's even got alternate voices\nif you want to change it,\n\n105\n00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.730\nmost people know the Siri voice\nas the American female voice.\n\n106\n00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.291\nSo, I'll leave it like it is.\n\n107\n00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:42.903\nBut once we've got that set up,\nnow, I can do things like,\n\n108\n00:05:42.903 --> 00:05:48.200\nwhen is Samuel Jackson's birthday?\n&gt;&gt; Who do you want to send it to?\n\n109\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.967\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, so\n\n110\n00:05:48.967 --> 00:05:54.195\nshe totally misheard what I was asking.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n111\n00:05:54.195 --> 00:05:55.459\n&gt;&gt; Who do you wanna send it to and\n\n112\n00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:58.580\nthen now she's gonna transcribe all that,\nso she can drive me crazy.\n\n113\n00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.150\n&gt;&gt; Who do you want to send it to?\n\n114\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.923\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n115\n00:06:00.923 --> 00:06:02.024\n&gt;&gt; Samuel Jackson.\n\n116\n00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:03.027\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there we go.\n\n117\n00:06:03.027 --> 00:06:03.655\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n118\n00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:04.371\n&gt;&gt; Hey, you know.\n\n119\n00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:04.946\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, but\n\n120\n00:06:04.946 --> 00:06:08.457\nit looks like there's something wrong\nwith the contact information for\n\n121\n00:06:08.457 --> 00:06:09.355\nSamuel Jackson.\n\n122\n00:06:09.355 --> 00:06:10.235\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, there we go.\n\n123\n00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:11.760\n&gt;&gt; Do you want to send it to?\n\n124\n00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.384\n&gt;&gt; All right, cancel.\n\n125\n00:06:13.384 --> 00:06:15.556\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I won't send it.\n\n126\n00:06:15.556 --> 00:06:18.770\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, so any else, so there it is.\n\n127\n00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.650\nAnd\n\n128\n00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.752\nright now on the desktop Siri is more on a\nnovelty that you can ask little questions,\n\n129\n00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:27.830\nyou can get her to send an email or\na text message or\n\n130\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.140\nwhatever, it's evolving, right?\nIt's a new product and\n\n131\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.240\nthat means that it's not perfect for\n\n132\n00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.460\nevery situation that's out there.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n133\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.580\n&gt;&gt; There are things like accessibility.\n\n134\n00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.770\nIf you have somebody who's\nvisually impaired, it's hard for\n\n135\n00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.270\nthem to use a computer.\n\n136\n00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.540\nWell, Siri is not designed for\naccessibility.\n\n137\n00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.520\nIt's not going to help that person,\nnot yet.\n\n138\n00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.810\nMaybe one day, one day we'll get\nthere it'll be like in Star Trek,\n\n139\n00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.280\nwhere instead of even using a keyboard,\n\n140\n00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.080\nyou're just like, computer,\nchart up a path to the Klingon planet.\n\n141\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.720\nSo it just does it and off you go,\nwe'll get there, right?\n\n142\n00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.120\nBut it's not there just yet.\n\n143\n00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.440\nSo there's not a whole lots\nof options here with Siri.\n\n144\n00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.350\nSiri is really kind of it's own\nseparate little program and\n\n145\n00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.580\nwe can interact with it that way,\nbut that's kind of the extent of it.\n\n146\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.040\nThere's not a whole heck\nof a lot going on here.\n\n147\n00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.420\nBut that is one of the voice engines\ntucked away inside of macOS.\n\n148\n00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.974\n&gt;&gt; So if Siri isn't suitable,\n\n149\n00:07:19.974 --> 00:07:22.702\nwhat would we use for accessibility?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n150\n00:07:22.702 --> 00:07:26.745\naccessibility actually has its own voice\nfunctionality, which is called VoiceOver.\n\n151\n00:07:26.745 --> 00:07:28.390\nVoiceOver is very mature.\n\n152\n00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.226\nIt's been a part of macOS for\na long, long time, over a decade.\n\n153\n00:07:32.226 --> 00:07:33.635\nAnd what VoiceOver is,\n\n154\n00:07:33.635 --> 00:07:38.920\nis specifically designed to help people\nwho are visually impaired, right?\n\n155\n00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.420\nWe don't talk to VoiceOver,\nVoiceOver talks to us.\n\n156\n00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.088\nWhen something appears on the screen that\nis like text, it reads it out to us and\n\n157\n00:07:47.088 --> 00:07:48.878\nit tells us what's going on.\n\n158\n00:07:48.878 --> 00:07:50.953\nSo if I go back to my System Preferences,\n\n159\n00:07:50.953 --> 00:07:54.920\nhere inside of the System Preferences\nyou'll find the Accessibility icon,\n\n160\n00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.118\nthis one right here, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n161\n00:07:57.118 --> 00:08:01.149\nAnd inside of it is where we have\nall sorts of features like Zoom,\n\n162\n00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:03.530\nwhich I'm using Zoom right now.\n\n163\n00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:08.030\nIf you're visually impaired, and maybe\nyou just have a hard time seeing things,\n\n164\n00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.610\nyou have bad vision like I do,\nyou can quickly zoom in and\n\n165\n00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.220\nmake things bigger,\nit makes it easier to see.\n\n166\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.995\nBut you also have the VoiceOver and\nSpeech functionality.\n\n167\n00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:22.010\nThat VoiceOver functionality\nlets the system know,\n\n168\n00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.570\nhey, I have a hard time reading this\nbecause I can't see the text very well, or\n\n169\n00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.640\nI can't see the text at all,\nplease read it for me.\n\n170\n00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.890\nWhen you go to install Mac OS,\non that very first screen, if you just sit\n\n171\n00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.220\nthere for a moment, you don't do anything,\neventually a voice starts talking.\n\n172\n00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.580\nAnd it says if you'd like to enable\nVoiceOver, please press Cmd+F5.\n\n173\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.750\nWell, you can do that\nCmd+F5 whenever you want.\n\n174\n00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.670\nSo here I am, I've been using this laptop\nfor months now, haven't used VoiceOver,\n\n175\n00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.880\nbut I can just hit Cmd+F5 and\nthat will turn it on.\n\n176\n00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.300\nOr I can just check here to enable it.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to VoiceOver.\n\n177\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.280\nVoiceOver speaks descriptions to items\non the screen and can be used to control\n\n178\n00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.358\nthe computer using only your keyboard.\n&gt;&gt; Got a deep voice, too [CROSSTALK].\n\n179\n00:08:59.358 --> 00:09:00.240\n&gt;&gt; If you already know how to\n\n180\n00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:00.950\nuse VoiceOver-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n181\n00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.500\nthat's-\n&gt;&gt; Press the V key now.\n\n182\n00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.312\n&gt;&gt; It's not voice that I would like to\n\n183\n00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:07.337\nuse.\n&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on system preferences.\n\n184\n00:09:07.337 --> 00:09:09.640\nAccessibility window,\naccessibility feature\n\n185\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.890\n&gt;&gt; Voice over selected has keyboard focus.\n\n186\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.710\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna mute that for\n\n187\n00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.238\njust a moment.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n188\n00:09:15.238 --> 00:09:17.711\n&gt;&gt; Because it goes in quite a bit\n\n189\n00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.770\n&gt;&gt; To us, right, to like me,\n\n190\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.870\nwhere I'm not visually impaired,\nVoiceOver gets kind of annoying, right?\n\n191\n00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.480\nBut put yourself in the shoes of\nsomebody who is visually impaired.\n\n192\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.350\nCan't see what's going on, right?\n\n193\n00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.430\nHow do I know what's going on?\n\n194\n00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:35.630\nI need to be able to see that, and having\nVoiceOver read it allows you to do that.\n\n195\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.290\nI mean, it opens up a whole new world to\nmake sure where you can use the system.\n\n196\n00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.220\nIt sounded like that was\nreading a little fast, right?\n\n197\n00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.482\nBut hey, if I want to scan across the\ncomputer, and I can do it with my eyes,\n\n198\n00:09:45.482 --> 00:09:49.835\nI can just scan across and see everything\nI need, I can do that very quickly.\n\n199\n00:09:49.835 --> 00:09:52.432\nBut if it's having to read to everything,\nI want it to go fast so\n\n200\n00:09:52.432 --> 00:09:54.610\nthat I can get that information quickly.\n\n201\n00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.830\nBut a lot of this stuff can be tweaked.\n\n202\n00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.060\nYou can train it,\nyou can make it better, right?\n\n203\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.968\nAnd you'll see those two\nbuttons down here at the bottom\n\n204\n00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:03.510\nthat are giving me that option.\n\n205\n00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.850\nI can open VoiceOver training.\n\n206\n00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:11.110\nAnd when I do that, it walks through\na process, the 22 step process,\n\n207\n00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.880\nthat tailors the VoiceOver\nsupport to your needs, or\n\n208\n00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.370\nto the end user's needs, right,\nyou wouldn't want to do it for yourself.\n\n209\n00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.060\nIt's for whoever it is that's\nactually going to be using VoiceOver.\n\n210\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.540\nThey run through this process.\n\n211\n00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.870\nIt teaches them how to use it.\n\n212\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.530\nIt tweaks how it reads things,\nthe orders it uses, and\n\n213\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:32.110\nit gets set up to be exactly\nwhat that end user needs.\n\n214\n00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.910\nAnd that, again,\nis just a really big deal.\n\n215\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.900\nBut then, you also have\nthe VoiceOver Utility right here.\n\n216\n00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.140\nAnd if I fire up the VoiceOver Utility,\nhere's where I can come in and\n\n217\n00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.650\nI can tweak the settings manually\nwithout running through a wizard.\n\n218\n00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:50.060\nI can go into what it is that triggers\nVoiceOver, what keyboard shortcut I use.\n\n219\n00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.830\nI can toggle the verbosity.\n\n220\n00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.540\nIs it gonna read all the text,\nevery single little bit of text?\n\n221\n00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.750\nOr is it gonna look for\nmajor text, and so on?\n\n222\n00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.860\nDo I have a braille keyboard\nwith braille support?\n\n223\n00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.010\nBecause it can display that.\n\n224\n00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:04.200\nBraille keyboards are awesome.\n\n225\n00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.260\nIf you ever had a chance to see one,\nit's borderline magic the way they work.\n\n226\n00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.240\nBut really, really cool system.\n\n227\n00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.230\nThey've got support for\nthat built right in.\n\n228\n00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.540\nBut you'll also see many of the other\nthings in here like Speech and Navigation.\n\n229\n00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.820\nUnder Speech,\nhere is where I can find that voice, and\n\n230\n00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.140\nright now it's Alex Compact, right?\n\n231\n00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.990\nWhich is designed to be\nthat deep fast voice.\n\n232\n00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.610\nThe rate is 45,\nI can slow it down, try and\n\n233\n00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.830\nmake it a little more reasonable, or\nI can change to a different voice.\n\n234\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.970\nI've Samantha, Victoria, Fred.\n\n235\n00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.599\nLet's just try Victoria, and\nI'll leave her rate the way that it is.\n\n236\n00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.690\nBut you can adjust Pitch,\nVolume, Intonation.\n\n237\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:46.184\nAll of these are settings in here that we\ncan tweak to make it something that is\n\n238\n00:11:46.184 --> 00:11:47.810\nmore personable, right?\n\n239\n00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:52.000\nIf this is your interface with the\ncomputer, you want it to be somebody you\n\n240\n00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.480\nenjoy listening to.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n241\n00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.300\n&gt;&gt; You don't want it to be like\n\n242\n00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.680\nFran Drescher or somebody.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n243\n00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.540\n&gt;&gt; What do you\n\n244\n00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.376\nmean?\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n245\n00:11:58.376 --> 00:12:01.890\nnow you have that kind of pain\nto listen to all day long.\n\n246\n00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.520\nSo we can kind of tweak that and\nfigure out, and get things the right way.\n\n247\n00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.390\nYou've also got this pronunciation tab.\n\n248\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.080\nAnd I used to think, boy, who needs that?\n\n249\n00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.580\nBut I started listening\nto audiobooks a lot.\n\n250\n00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.870\nAnd, if there's ever a narrator\nwho mispronounces a word,\n\n251\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.460\nit gets super annoying,\nespecially if it's over and over.\n\n252\n00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.960\nSo you can come in here and\ntweak how certain words are pronounced.\n\n253\n00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.910\nSo for example, here they've got 802.11b.\n\n254\n00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.950\nNow, when I look at that,\nI know it's 802.11b.\n\n255\n00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:33.340\nBut when the VoiceOver looks at it,\nit might say 802 point,\n\n256\n00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:39.520\nor 802 period 11b, and\nnot know to say it as 8 2 dot 11 b.\n\n257\n00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.870\nSo we can specify that, and now it will\nknow the right way to pronounce or\n\n258\n00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.320\nsay that, or here it's gonna say, instead\nof saying G-U-I, it's gonna say gooey.\n\n259\n00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.470\nOr instead of G-I-F, it will say giff.\n\n260\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.190\nSo it's\n\n261\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.610\nhow to pronounce these various things.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n262\n00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:54.170\n&gt;&gt; That, again,\n\n263\n00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.950\nis just trying to make this\nwhere it works really well.\n\n264\n00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:04.662\nIt handles our interaction, and\nnow that I've changed the voice,\n\n265\n00:13:04.662 --> 00:13:10.327\nlet's go back here, and\nI'm going to turn that back on.\n\n266\n00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:14.710\nAnd but did I actually turn it off?\n&gt;&gt; System preferences,\n\n267\n00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.580\naccessibility window,\naccessibility features, table, voiceover.\n\n268\n00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.080\n&gt;&gt; That's better.\n\n269\n00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.780\n&gt;&gt; Selected as keyboard focus.\n\n270\n00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.636\n&gt;&gt; It's better than the deep voice,\n\n271\n00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:25.063\nbut it's still-\n&gt;&gt; Press control option.\n\n272\n00:13:25.063 --> 00:13:28.915\nShould voicover.\n&gt;&gt; It's still a little trimmed.\n\n273\n00:13:28.915 --> 00:13:30.230\n&gt;&gt; Speech.\n\n274\n00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:34.040\nMenu 79 check mark at top.\n&gt;&gt; So we can like slow that rate down\n\n275\n00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.840\na little bit, try and get it a little-\n&gt;&gt; Rate 30.\n\n276\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.748\n&gt;&gt; Well, that might be a little too slow.\n\n277\n00:13:38.748 --> 00:13:40.240\n&gt;&gt; Rate 35.\n\n278\n00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.040\n&gt;&gt; That's a little better.\n\n279\n00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.240\nSo you kinda-\n&gt;&gt; System preference.\n\n280\n00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.000\n&gt;&gt; Mess around with it a bit.\n\n281\n00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.670\n&gt;&gt; Accessibility window.\n\n282\n00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.280\nAccessibility features.\n\n283\n00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.890\nTable VoiceOver selected.\n\n284\n00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.430\nYou are currently on the, muting.\n&gt;&gt; And so, if you see what it was doing\n\n285\n00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.690\nthere, it highlighted this table and it's\ngoing through and reading the options so\n\n286\n00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.420\nI know what options are there, and\nwe can kind of pick and chose.\n\n287\n00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.575\nThat's the The way that\nthis VoiceOver functions.\n\n288\n00:14:04.575 --> 00:14:06.215\nIt's pretty slick stuff.\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n289\n00:14:06.215 --> 00:14:09.021\n&gt;&gt; It works really well, does a great job.\n\n290\n00:14:09.021 --> 00:14:12.907\nAnd for most people, that's really\ngoing to meet their needs and\n\n291\n00:14:12.907 --> 00:14:17.055\nkind of take care of allowing them\nto hear what's on the screen.\n\n292\n00:14:17.055 --> 00:14:18.175\nSiri can't do that.\n\n293\n00:14:18.175 --> 00:14:21.220\nIf you ask Siri a question,\nshe can answer the question,\n\n294\n00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.030\nbut she's not gonna tell\nyou what's on the screen.\n\n295\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.840\nYou can't say Siri, what's on my screen?\n\n296\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.790\nShe just doesn't know.\n\n297\n00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.240\nAnd eventually,\nwe might get to that point,\n\n298\n00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.180\nbut we're not there yet.\n&gt;&gt; Are there any other ways to use speech\n\n299\n00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.050\nwith Mac OS?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n300\n00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:36.410\nso I focused on VoiceOver talking to us.\n\n301\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:37.695\nBut we can talk back.\n\n302\n00:14:37.695 --> 00:14:40.588\nYou might have noticed down here,\nwell, actually,\n\n303\n00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:44.897\nin one of the setting screens that I was\non a minute ago in the VoiceOver Utility,\n\n304\n00:14:44.897 --> 00:14:49.360\nthat we actually have things in here like\nnavigation and how navigation happens.\n\n305\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.830\nAnd most of this is talking about\nusing your keyboard to navigate.\n\n306\n00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.600\nBut you can use your voice to\ndo a lot of this stuff, too.\n\n307\n00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.710\nWhat I'm seeing here is all built\naround the VoiceOver utility,\n\n308\n00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.200\nwhich I'm going to turn off.\n\n309\n00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:06.060\nIf I go back to my system preferences,\nand I go into keyboard,\n\n310\n00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.490\nunder the keyboard settings,\na really weird place for this to be.\n\n311\n00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.720\nBut under the keyboard settings, you'll\nsee a tab in there called Dictation.\n\n312\n00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.260\nAnd if you take a look at that,\nyou've got dictation support where you can\n\n313\n00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.830\nactually talk to the computer,\nand you can tell it things.\n\n314\n00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.604\nVery similar to Siri, right?\n\n315\n00:15:23.604 --> 00:15:27.500\nExcept with Siri, you can ask it a\nquestion, it'll go out and find an answer.\n\n316\n00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.220\nWith Dictation, it doesn't do that,\nit doesn't answer your questions.\n\n317\n00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.670\nYou tell it commands, and\nit does the commands.\n\n318\n00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.360\nIf you tell it anything else,\nit assumes that you're typing.\n\n319\n00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.034\nSo if you're writing an e-mail,\nyou can just start talking and\n\n320\n00:15:40.034 --> 00:15:42.370\nsaying the context of the e-mail,\nand it types it out.\n\n321\n00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.260\nActually, it works really, really well.\n\n322\n00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.080\nNow, I've got Dictation\nturned off on mine.\n\n323\n00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.230\nI'm going to turn that on.\n\n324\n00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.294\nAnd when you turn it on,\n\n325\n00:15:49.294 --> 00:15:52.026\nthere's really only one option\nthat we need to worry about.\n\n326\n00:15:52.026 --> 00:15:55.390\nAnd its this enhanced dictation option,\nokay?\n\n327\n00:15:55.390 --> 00:16:00.258\nNow, Dictation by default\nworks a lot like Siri does.\n\n328\n00:16:00.258 --> 00:16:02.620\nYou say something,\nit makes a fingerprint of it.\n\n329\n00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.860\nIt sends it to Apple, Apple decodes into\ntext, sends it back and now it's a text.\n\n330\n00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:07.630\nOkay?\n\n331\n00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.820\nWell, if I turn on enhanced dictation,\n\n332\n00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.560\nit downloads the voice files right here\nto my Mac and now it can work offline.\n\n333\n00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.610\nIt doesn't have to phone\nhome to Apple anymore.\n\n334\n00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:22.100\nIf you're gonna be using this a lot, it's\na good idea to turn on enhanced dictation.\n\n335\n00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:27.040\nWhen you turn it on, it downloads a file,\nit's about 1.2 gigs in size.\n\n336\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.330\nAnd for whatever reason,\nit downloads slow.\n\n337\n00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.130\nSo when you turn it on,\nit can take an hour.\n\n338\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.282\nI've been on gigabit fiber networks,\nyou don't get any progress\n\n339\n00:16:36.282 --> 00:16:40.178\nreport while it's downloading so you just\ndon't know but it takes about an hour.\n\n340\n00:16:40.178 --> 00:16:44.673\nBut you turn it on and, once that's done,\nnow you can do voice dictation even when\n\n341\n00:16:44.673 --> 00:16:48.890\nyou're offline and it works really,\nreally, surprisingly well.\n\n342\n00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.980\nAnd the way that that dictation\nworks is in two modes,\n\n343\n00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.180\nactually there is command mode,\nwrites all the commands.\n\n344\n00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.590\nBut then there's just\nthe general typing mode, and\n\n345\n00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:02.010\nyou'll see where mine's set to use a\nshortcut of press the function key twice.\n\n346\n00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.950\nSo if I were to tap that key twice,\nwe start dictation, and\n\n347\n00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.210\nI can start inputting information.\n\n348\n00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:12.060\nSo I'm gonna fire out the text edit\nutility, I'll do a new document here,\n\n349\n00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:16.970\nand let me get to a nice big font\nthat we can all read, there we go.\n\n350\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.970\nAll right and so let's say I wanna write\na letter but I don't wanna use my hands,\n\n351\n00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.630\nI wanna voice-dictate this out.\n\n352\n00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:28.740\nThen what I can do, make sure I'm not\nmuted, is I can tap my function key twice\n\n353\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.370\nand the dictation box is gonna pop up and\nthen I can start talking.\n\n354\n00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.355\nThis is a sentence that I'm\ntyping with voice dictation.\n\n355\n00:17:38.759 --> 00:17:40.353\nPeriod.\n\n356\n00:17:40.353 --> 00:17:43.530\nThis is another sentence that\nI'm typing with voice dictation.\n\n357\n00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:49.028\nIt's doing a pretty good job.\n&gt;&gt; Period.\n\n358\n00:17:49.028 --> 00:17:49.765\n&gt;&gt; So, [LAUGH] yeah,\n\n359\n00:17:49.765 --> 00:17:52.000\nI tapped the function key\ntwice to turn it off.\n\n360\n00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.130\nSo when I did that,\nlook how good a job it did.\n\n361\n00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.286\nI did better than, I asked Siri when\nSamuel Jackson's birthday was and\n\n362\n00:17:58.286 --> 00:18:01.296\nit It couldn't help me because you\ndidn't understand what I said.\n\n363\n00:18:01.296 --> 00:18:04.065\nBut here, this is sentence that I'm\ntyping with voice dictation and\n\n364\n00:18:04.065 --> 00:18:05.604\nthen I told it to put a period in there.\n\n365\n00:18:05.604 --> 00:18:10.300\nThe second time I did two sentences,\nI didn't tell about the period,\n\n366\n00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.556\nit didn't do the,\n&gt;&gt; Semi colon.\n\n367\n00:18:14.556 --> 00:18:16.370\nWhat is a comma?\n\n368\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.315\n&gt;&gt; Punctuation, there you go.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n369\n00:18:17.315 --> 00:18:19.038\n&gt;&gt; It didn't do the punctuation mark, or\n\n370\n00:18:19.038 --> 00:18:21.890\na comma, or a semicolon, or\nwhatever to separate that out.\n\n371\n00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.650\nSo it's not applying like proper grammar\nstuff, but it is taking your voice turn\n\n372\n00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:29.580\nyou into words it doing a pretty good job.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n373\n00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.680\n&gt;&gt; And it doesn't just work in Apple\n\n374\n00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.400\nsoftware.\n\n375\n00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.920\nIt works anywhere that accepts text input.\n\n376\n00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.490\nSo if I were to fire up Microsoft Word,\nwhich I thought would come up quickly,\n\n377\n00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:41.860\nbut there we go.\n\n378\n00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:45.570\nSo if I fire up Microsoft Word,\nI can do a new blank document here and\n\n379\n00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.360\nI can start to use the dictation\nin this one as well.\n\n380\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.230\nSo when we come through and do it this\nway, let me go to another nice big font.\n\n381\n00:18:55.925 --> 00:18:58.380\nThis is a test inside of Microsoft Word.\n\n382\n00:19:01.089 --> 00:19:05.022\nAnd there we go, you can use that anywhere\nyou login to Gmail to do it and email and\n\n383\n00:19:05.022 --> 00:19:07.340\nyou can just voice out\ndictate that out email.\n\n384\n00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.450\nYou don't have to type anything\nyou just ride along and\n\n385\n00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:13.120\noff it goes ready to rock and you're done.\n\n386\n00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:17.050\nSo really cool system there, and that's\nbeen a part of Mac OS for a long time.\n\n387\n00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.340\nIf you use it in\nconjunction of voice over,\n\n388\n00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.530\nnow it's reading to us on the screen, and\nthen you're just telling it what to type.\n\n389\n00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.630\nAnd you've got a fully\nvoice interactive system.\n\n390\n00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:26.850\n&gt;&gt; That's very impressive, but\n\n391\n00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.590\nwhat commands does dictation listen for?\n&gt;&gt; There\n\n392\n00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.360\nwhole list of command I'll put\na bunch of them as shown in the photo.\n\n393\n00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.530\nJust give me an example.\n\n394\n00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:35.432\nlet me just show you.\n\n395\n00:19:35.432 --> 00:19:38.154\nSelect on.\n\n396\n00:19:38.154 --> 00:19:40.876\nCopy that.\n\n397\n00:19:40.876 --> 00:19:43.938\nPaste that.\n\n398\n00:19:43.938 --> 00:19:47.000\nPaste that.\n\n399\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.530\nPaste that.\n\n400\n00:19:50.834 --> 00:19:54.102\nAll right, I've done a select all so\nwhen I did paste that the first time,\n\n401\n00:19:54.102 --> 00:19:56.020\nit just over wrote what was already there.\n\n402\n00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.630\nSo I did it a couple times, but\nwhat you can see is I was telling it,\n\n403\n00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.920\nselect all the text, copy it,\npaste it, it's doing that, right?\n\n404\n00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.160\nIt's going through and\nrunning through those commands.\n\n405\n00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.670\nCouple examples of other ones,\nthat was like cut, copy, and paste.\n\n406\n00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:13.350\nIt does those, you can tell it to bold,\nitalicize, underline.\n\n407\n00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:14.460\nIt can do those.\n\n408\n00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:20.780\nYou can tell it to scroll up,\nscroll down, so it can navigate that way.\n\n409\n00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.380\nWhat else can it do?\n\n410\n00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.418\nMove left, move right for\nnavigating around that way.\n\n411\n00:20:26.418 --> 00:20:28.036\nHere's a pretty handy one.\n\n412\n00:20:29.973 --> 00:20:30.957\nShow commands.\n\n413\n00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:33.410\nThere we go.\n\n414\n00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.340\nTurn that off.\n\n415\n00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:40.230\nSo now when I did show commands,\nit brings up a little window here.\n\n416\n00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.600\nNo it went away.\n\n417\n00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.655\nWell it brought up a little window for\na brief while.\n\n418\n00:20:43.655 --> 00:20:44.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n419\n00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.190\n&gt;&gt; Wow, I am, now I've shrunk my document\n\n420\n00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.630\ndown by chopping.\n&gt;&gt; It's very tiny.\n\n421\n00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:49.640\n&gt;&gt; Apparently I don't know how to use\n\n422\n00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.610\nMicrosoft Word.\n\n423\n00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:54.789\nBut I show command,\nit's kind of a nice one.\n\n424\n00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:55.605\nLet's try this again.\n\n425\n00:20:55.605 --> 00:20:59.930\n[LAUGH]\nWell eventually I get this work,\n\n426\n00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:00.575\nshow commands.\n\n427\n00:21:00.575 --> 00:21:05.783\n[SOUND] And so now I can see the selection\ncommands, navigation commands,\n\n428\n00:21:05.783 --> 00:21:11.327\nI can see the editing commands,\nformatting system like starting dictation,\n\n429\n00:21:11.327 --> 00:21:14.108\nstopping dictation, all right here.\n\n430\n00:21:14.108 --> 00:21:16.640\nYou get an idea of what\ncommands are supported.\n\n431\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.160\nSo I said I was gonna put\nsome on the show notes,\n\n432\n00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.970\nit wasn't gonna be nearly\nas thorough as this.\n\n433\n00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.080\nSo definitely take a browse through there,\nand\n\n434\n00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.970\nyou'll see these commands vary depending\non which application you get into.\n\n435\n00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.920\nAnother thing to watch out for\nis notice I've been talking a lot, and\n\n436\n00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.320\nit thinks that I'm still navigating.\n\n437\n00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.112\nAnd so it tried typing, but\neventually, I ran through its buffer.\n\n438\n00:21:36.112 --> 00:21:38.580\n&gt;&gt; It can only get so much text at a time.\n\n439\n00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:42.320\nSo be conscious of that as\nyou're dictating out that\n\n440\n00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.460\nyou need to pause every now and\n\n441\n00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.260\nthen to give it a chance to catch up.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n442\n00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.640\nApplication support part two,\nanother wonderful episode done well done.\n\n443\n00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.620\nBefore we move on anything\nelse you like to say?\n\n444\n00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:55.894\n&gt;&gt; As far as all this voice stuff,\n\n445\n00:21:55.894 --> 00:21:57.908\nmake sure you take a look\nat a mess around with it.\n\n446\n00:21:57.908 --> 00:22:03.370\nIf you're working with people are visually\nimpaired then get their opinion.\n\n447\n00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.000\nTalk to them, don't try to force\none of these solutions on them.\n\n448\n00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.520\nThey usually have something that helps\nmake the system work the best for them.\n\n449\n00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.030\nThey might have third party software.\n\n450\n00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.970\nThere's plenty of amazing third party\nsolutions that do a lot of the same stuff.\n\n451\n00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.180\nYou want to make sure\nthe computers are accessible and\n\n452\n00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.740\neasy to use as possible and that\ndoesn't mean shoe-horning somebody into\n\n453\n00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.440\none particular solution just\nbecause it's already installed.\n\n454\n00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.200\nBut if they have nothing,\nthese solutions are great.\n\n455\n00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.830\nYou can leverage them right away.\n\n456\n00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:35.520\nYou provide that access, and you're giving\naccess to a whole new world to people.\n\n457\n00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.305\nIt's really an amazing thing.\n&gt;&gt; It really is amazing.\n\n458\n00:22:37.305 --> 00:22:38.910\nAnd what else is amazing?\n\n459\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.630\nApple Certified support professional,\nthe series.\n\n460\n00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.760\nMake sure you watch every single episode.\n\n461\n00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.000\nYou're gonna be so glad you did.\n\n462\n00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.190\nAnd you'll be in the course library where\nthere's thousands of other videos that\n\n463\n00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.540\nare there to help you go further,\nso look at those too.\n\n464\n00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.180\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n465\n00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.800\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n466\n00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.240\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n467\n00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.975\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again very soon.\n\n468\n00:22:58.975 --> 00:23:05.595\n[MUSIC]\n\n469\n00:23:05.595 --> 00:23:07.540\nThank you for watching, ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.163\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.163 --> 00:00:12.230\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.939\nthank you for watching ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.655\nI'm Zach Memos, your host for\n\n7\n00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:22.496\nthis episode of Apple Certified Support\nProfessional Applications Support Part 3.\n\n8\n00:00:22.496 --> 00:00:25.585\nAnd, of course, Don Pezet is here to take\nus through it, Don, good to see you, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:26.580\n&gt;&gt; Hey, glad to be back, Zach.\n\n10\n00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.767\nAnd we're going to talk a little\nbit more about the odd and\n\n11\n00:00:29.767 --> 00:00:33.568\nunusual applications that we might\nbump into as we work with Mac OS.\n\n12\n00:00:33.568 --> 00:00:37.675\nIn the first episode, we talked about Java\napplications and iCloud applications.\n\n13\n00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:40.596\nIn the second episode, we talked about\nvoice enabled applications like Siri.\n\n14\n00:00:40.596 --> 00:00:41.516\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n15\n00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:42.297\n&gt;&gt; In this episode,\n\n16\n00:00:42.297 --> 00:00:44.278\nwe're going to get\na little more technical,\n\n17\n00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:47.054\nwe're going to talk about things\nlike 64 bit applications.\n\n18\n00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:51.256\nAnd applications that are sandboxed,\nthat have security boundaries on them.\n\n19\n00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:52.758\nAnd kind of explain how those work and\n\n20\n00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:55.390\nunderstand how they might impact\nthe way that our programs run.\n\n21\n00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.256\nSo that should get us to the end\nof our Application Support series.\n\n22\n00:00:59.256 --> 00:01:01.154\nBut there's a few more little quirks and\nodds and\n\n23\n00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:03.700\nends that we need to know to\nunderstand how all of our applications\n\n24\n00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.294\nbehave.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n25\n00:01:04.294 --> 00:01:07.331\nwhat do we need to know\nabout 64 bit apps in Mac OS?\n\n26\n00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:07.839\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n27\n00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:09.669\nApple has been promoting this pretty big,\nright?\n\n28\n00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:15.878\nMac OS has been a 64 bit operating system\nfor a long time, since I think 10.7,\n\n29\n00:01:15.878 --> 00:01:19.324\nLion, Mountain Lion, I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n30\n00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:20.201\n&gt;&gt; A while back, so\n\n31\n00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:22.092\nit's been a 64 bit OS for a while.\n\n32\n00:01:22.092 --> 00:01:24.439\nPrior to that,\nit was a 32 bit operating system.\n\n33\n00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.331\nApplications written for\nMac OS were 32 bit,\n\n34\n00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:31.681\nand what that means is they can only\naddress a certain amount of memory.\n\n35\n00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:36.667\nThey had a number that was limited\nto 32 binary bits, zeroes and ones,\n\n36\n00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:40.932\nand that meant that it was kinda\ncapped out at a certain point.\n\n37\n00:01:40.932 --> 00:01:44.706\nThat if you had an application\nthat was 32 bit,\n\n38\n00:01:44.706 --> 00:01:48.035\nit could not use more\nthan four gigs of RAM.\n\n39\n00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:51.940\nNow, there's tons of Macs these days\nthat come with 16 gigs of RAM, or\n\n40\n00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.624\neven more if you have a Mac Pro.\n\n41\n00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:57.700\nIf an application can't use more than four\ngigs of RAM, why sell a Mac with 16 gigs?\n\n42\n00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.776\nWell, I could run four applications, for\neach one use 4 gigs of memory, right?\n\n43\n00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:08.643\nBut if I had one application,\nmaybe like AutoCAD, or a database server.\n\n44\n00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:11.003\nAnd I wanted it to have 10 gigs of memory,\n\n45\n00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:13.637\nyou can't do that with\na 32 bit application.\n\n46\n00:02:13.637 --> 00:02:17.761\nA 64-bit application, though, it can.\n\n47\n00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:22.458\nSo, for example, a 32 bit application\nis limited to four gigs of RAM.\n\n48\n00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:28.018\nBut a 64 bit application can access,\nI've got the number written down\n\n49\n00:02:28.018 --> 00:02:33.508\nhere because it's hard to remember,\nis 18.4 exabytes of memory.\n\n50\n00:02:33.508 --> 00:02:35.016\nThat's a lot of memory, right?\n\n51\n00:02:35.016 --> 00:02:39.095\nSo it goes from megabytes to gigabytes to\n\n52\n00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:43.990\nterabytes to petabytes to exabytes.\n&gt;&gt; It's way out there.\n\n53\n00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.598\n&gt;&gt; You can't buy exabytes of memory in\n\n54\n00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.232\na single system right now,\nit's just not even possible.\n\n55\n00:02:48.232 --> 00:02:52.183\nSo 64 bit applications give us\naccess to a ton more memory,\n\n56\n00:02:52.183 --> 00:02:54.361\nthat means better performance.\n\n57\n00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:56.274\nBut there's also security enhancements and\n\n58\n00:02:56.274 --> 00:02:58.701\nother things that are built\ninto 64 bit applications.\n\n59\n00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:03.407\nSo Apple has been banging the drum for\nyears, saying, developers,\n\n60\n00:03:03.407 --> 00:03:07.477\nyou need to switch your\napplications over to 64 bit mode.\n\n61\n00:03:07.477 --> 00:03:11.254\nWell, with Mac OS High Sierra,\nthey've thrown down the gauntlet.\n\n62\n00:03:11.254 --> 00:03:13.328\nAnd they've said, that's it,\n\n63\n00:03:13.328 --> 00:03:17.857\nthis the last version of Mac OS that\nwill support 32 bit applications.\n\n64\n00:03:17.857 --> 00:03:22.465\nWhen the next version comes out,\nwhen 10.14 comes out,\n\n65\n00:03:22.465 --> 00:03:24.688\nMac OS, even higher Sierra.\n\n66\n00:03:24.688 --> 00:03:29.377\nWhen that one comes out, then that one\nwill only run 64 bit applications,\n\n67\n00:03:29.377 --> 00:03:32.906\nand the 32 bit apps you have\nwill no longer run, right?\n\n68\n00:03:32.906 --> 00:03:35.845\nIf you want to run them, you'll have to\nrun them inside of a virtual machine.\n\n69\n00:03:35.845 --> 00:03:39.976\nOr you won't be able to upgrade to\nthe newer OS if you need to maintain those\n\n70\n00:03:39.976 --> 00:03:41.519\napps, that's a big deal.\n\n71\n00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.388\nNow I'll tell you that most developers\nhave already moved over to 64 bit.\n\n72\n00:03:45.388 --> 00:03:49.642\nIf you got it from the app store, the odds\nare it's already 64 bit as well, so\n\n73\n00:03:49.642 --> 00:03:51.009\nyou're probably fine.\n\n74\n00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.745\nIf you don't know, though, like,\nhey, maybe I have an app and\n\n75\n00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:55.394\nI don't know if it's 32 bit or not.\n\n76\n00:03:55.394 --> 00:03:59.738\nWell, in High Sierra, if you run a 32\nbit app, you get a pop up box, and\n\n77\n00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:00.604\nit tells you.\n\n78\n00:04:00.604 --> 00:04:01.197\nIt says, hey,\n\n79\n00:04:01.197 --> 00:04:04.177\nwarning, this is the last version of\nSierra that's going to run this thing.\n\n80\n00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:06.425\nAnd so it tells you that,\nit lets you know,\n\n81\n00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:09.184\nreal easy to tell if you've\ngot a 32 bit app or not.\n\n82\n00:04:09.184 --> 00:04:13.298\nBut after that, if it's already 64 bit,\nyou'll be in good shape,\n\n83\n00:04:13.298 --> 00:04:15.964\nyou can run it, pop it up,\nand you can see it.\n\n84\n00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:20.733\nNow, some developers have had a bit of\na hard time transitioning from 32 bit to\n\n85\n00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:21.385\n64 bit.\n\n86\n00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:26.656\nAnd so their app might be both,\nwhere it's got 32 and 64 bit inside.\n\n87\n00:04:26.656 --> 00:04:28.993\nFirefox was like this for\nseveral versions,\n\n88\n00:04:28.993 --> 00:04:32.629\nthey actually just removed the 32\nbit mode out of it not too long ago.\n\n89\n00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.653\nBut there are some apps\nthat still have it, and\n\n90\n00:04:35.653 --> 00:04:40.320\na great example of that is the Mac\nOS High Sierra installation program.\n\n91\n00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.085\nAnd you might ask yourself,\nwhy would Apple still have a 32 bit app?\n\n92\n00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:48.508\nAnd the reason is, I might want to install\nMac OS High Sierra, if I can find it,\n\n93\n00:04:48.508 --> 00:04:50.397\nit's in here somewhere, here.\n\n94\n00:04:50.397 --> 00:04:53.811\nI might want to install High Sierra on a\nsystem that's currently running the 32 bit\n\n95\n00:04:53.811 --> 00:04:55.219\nversion of the operating system.\n\n96\n00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:58.059\nSo it needs to run\nthe installer in 32 bit, and\n\n97\n00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:02.758\nthen it installs the 64 bit version,\nso that's why they have that support.\n\n98\n00:05:02.758 --> 00:05:05.426\nIf your application supports both modes,\n\n99\n00:05:05.426 --> 00:05:08.250\nyou can see it in\nthe Get Information screen.\n\n100\n00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.862\nIf you two-finger tap and\ndo Get Info, or just do Command I and\n\n101\n00:05:12.862 --> 00:05:15.365\npull up the Information screen.\n\n102\n00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:20.299\nInside of the Information screen, what\nyou'll see is this little box right here,\n\n103\n00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:21.787\nOpen in 32-bit mode.\n\n104\n00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:25.832\nThat's telling me this application\nhas both 64 bit and 32 bit mode,\n\n105\n00:05:25.832 --> 00:05:29.692\nit's going to open in 64 bit mode\nby default, that's what I want.\n\n106\n00:05:29.692 --> 00:05:33.564\nOr I could open it in 32 bit mode,\nI've mentioned Firefox,\n\n107\n00:05:33.564 --> 00:05:37.073\nFirefox used to be like this,\nwhich if I find it in here.\n\n108\n00:05:37.073 --> 00:05:40.682\nHere's Firefox and\nI'll do a Get Info on that one, and\n\n109\n00:05:40.682 --> 00:05:44.151\nsee that Open in 32-bit mode is gone now,\nright?\n\n110\n00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:47.162\nIt's gone because they don't support it,\nthey moved,\n\n111\n00:05:47.162 --> 00:05:49.932\nthey are a 64 bit browser now and\nthat's how it is.\n\n112\n00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:53.417\nBut you'll find over time\nthat a lot of applications,\n\n113\n00:05:53.417 --> 00:05:56.234\nthe developers just had\nto do a little work.\n\n114\n00:05:56.234 --> 00:05:58.844\nWith Firefox, the challenge\nthey had were with the plugins.\n\n115\n00:05:58.844 --> 00:06:02.503\nThey had all these 32 bits plugins,\nand when they switch to 64 bit mode,\n\n116\n00:06:02.503 --> 00:06:05.490\nall of those plugins break, so\nthat was a lot of work for them.\n\n117\n00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.296\nOther developers, like,\ntake an application like gas masks,\n\n118\n00:06:10.296 --> 00:06:13.948\nthat's a little name look\nup utility that I use.\n\n119\n00:06:13.948 --> 00:06:16.704\nAnd with that utility,\nall the developer had to do is go in and\n\n120\n00:06:16.704 --> 00:06:18.938\nrecompile it in 64 bit mode and\nthey were done.\n\n121\n00:06:18.938 --> 00:06:23.474\nThey had it ported over years ago, just\nsuper easy to make that transition, so\n\n122\n00:06:23.474 --> 00:06:26.522\nsome applications are more\ndifficult than others.\n\n123\n00:06:26.522 --> 00:06:30.266\nIf you're getting that pop up that's\ntelling you, hey, this is a 32 bit app,\n\n124\n00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:32.701\nit's not going to work in\nthe next version of Mac OS.\n\n125\n00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:35.042\nYou need to reach out to\nthat developer and say, hey,\n\n126\n00:06:35.042 --> 00:06:37.084\nare you going to publish\nthe 64 bit version?\n\n127\n00:06:37.084 --> 00:06:39.004\nHopefully they say yes, if they say no,\n\n128\n00:06:39.004 --> 00:06:41.217\nyou need to find\nan alternative application.\n\n129\n00:06:41.217 --> 00:06:44.078\nYou need to be looking for\nwhat you're going to migrate to,\n\n130\n00:06:44.078 --> 00:06:47.353\nbecause going forward,\nthose 32 cubit apps are going to be dead.\n\n131\n00:06:47.353 --> 00:06:49.453\n&gt;&gt; And you mentioned better security,\n\n132\n00:06:49.453 --> 00:06:52.656\nhow does Mac OS secure applications?\n&gt;&gt; So there is a lot of magic\n\n133\n00:06:52.656 --> 00:06:56.317\nthat goes on behind the scenes, and we've\nseen some of that in some of our episodes.\n\n134\n00:06:56.317 --> 00:06:58.896\nLike when you download\nan application from the Internet and\n\n135\n00:06:58.896 --> 00:07:01.178\nyou run it,\nyou get the gatekeeper functionality.\n\n136\n00:07:01.178 --> 00:07:04.069\nWe covered that in another episode\nwhere it pops up and says,\n\n137\n00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:05.722\nare you sure you want to open this?\n\n138\n00:07:05.722 --> 00:07:09.165\nIt's an untrusted developer,\nso that's going on, right, but\n\n139\n00:07:09.165 --> 00:07:10.990\nthere's actually another part.\n\n140\n00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.986\nThe applications themselves,\nif you get them from the Apple App Store,\n\n141\n00:07:14.986 --> 00:07:17.621\nthey're running in\nwhat's called a sandbox.\n\n142\n00:07:17.621 --> 00:07:21.585\nThe sandbox makes sure that one\napplication can't modify files from\n\n143\n00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:22.961\nanother application.\n\n144\n00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:26.910\nWhat you could have is you could have an\napplication that looks perfectly normal.\n\n145\n00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.009\nBut it's modifying another app\nto inject it with malware or\n\n146\n00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:32.562\nmake it do something that\nit's not supposed to.\n\n147\n00:07:32.562 --> 00:07:36.319\nOr monitoring your activities, turning on\nyour microphone when you don't know it,\n\n148\n00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.216\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n149\n00:07:37.216 --> 00:07:40.585\nSo by putting it in a sandbox,\nit can prevent that, now,\n\n150\n00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:44.114\nsandbox is just a fancy term to\nsay like a jail cell, right?\n\n151\n00:07:44.114 --> 00:07:46.501\nWe take the application,\nwe put it in a cage, and\n\n152\n00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:48.909\nit can't access anything\noutside of that cage.\n\n153\n00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:51.021\nNow an end user, they never see that.\n\n154\n00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:54.460\nThey just come in here and they see all\nthese applications, they run them and\n\n155\n00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.491\nthat's that, okay?\n\n156\n00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:58.701\nBut in the background,\nsome pretty neat stuff is happening,\n\n157\n00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:00.625\nlet me show you here in the terminal.\n\n158\n00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:06.086\nIn several episodes I've shown you the\n/Library folder where the global settings\n\n159\n00:08:06.086 --> 00:08:11.626\nare or even in my home folder, where I\nhave /User/dpezet/Library, and there's\n\n160\n00:08:11.626 --> 00:08:17.190\nall these application files and settings\nand stuff that are tucked away in there.\n\n161\n00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.130\nAll of these things,\n\n162\n00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:22.630\nlike the preferences, if I go into that\npreferences folder and take a look.\n\n163\n00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.190\nHere's preferences for\ntons of applications.\n\n164\n00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.580\nWell, if I have a program that can\nwrite to this preferences folder,\n\n165\n00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.020\ncouldn't it change the preferences\nof another program?\n\n166\n00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.840\nRight, I can have web camera program,\nthat goes in and\n\n167\n00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.360\nfinds the Microsoft Outlook\npreferences and\n\n168\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.240\nchanges my email to forward copies\nof my email to some other address.\n\n169\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.250\nThat would be bad right?\n&gt;&gt; That would be bad,\n\n170\n00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.960\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n171\n00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.220\nthe sandbox helps to prevent that,\nit creates walls.\n\n172\n00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.050\nIt puts these walls in\nbetween each application.\n\n173\n00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.300\nAnd this comes from the iOS world.\n\n174\n00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.110\nIn iOS, every application is sandboxed and\nisolated from each other.\n\n175\n00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:04.030\nSo if we want to see that,\nwe don't actually see it here.\n\n176\n00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:08.530\nWhat you see is if I go\nback into my library,\n\n177\n00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:13.640\ninside of the library folder, there's\na new folder called containers, right?\n\n178\n00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.240\nThe containers, these are the sandboxes.\n\n179\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.570\nThese are the little jail cells that\nit creates with the applications and\n\n180\n00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.800\nwhen you browse into there, you'll find\nfolders for a lot of applications.\n\n181\n00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.480\nI mentioned Microsoft Outlook.\n\n182\n00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.120\nMicrosoft Outlook has a container.\n\n183\n00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.590\nIt has little jail cell,\nright there, right?\n\n184\n00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.350\nSo no other application could come in and\nmessed with these preferences.\n\n185\n00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.540\nOnly Microsoft Outlook\ncan get into that folder.\n\n186\n00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.970\nI don't actually use Outlook so\nit doesn't matter to me, but it is there.\n\n187\n00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.376\nYou'll see other applications\nlike wunderlist,\n\n188\n00:09:43.376 --> 00:09:49.320\nmy little to-do program, several or\nall the Apple programs are in here.\n\n189\n00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.260\nEach one of them maintaining their\nown preferences, and settings,\n\n190\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.680\nand other information.\n\n191\n00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.220\nAnd if you poke inside of one of these, so\n\n192\n00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:03.460\nlet's take, who's somebody we\ncan use as an example here.\n\n193\n00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.798\nLet's take, yeah we wanna use,\nit's tough decisions today.\n\n194\n00:10:08.798 --> 00:10:11.199\nWe'll try Outlook,\nthat would should have it.\n\n195\n00:10:11.199 --> 00:10:15.242\nSo if I go into com.microsoft.outlook and\nI look in there,\n\n196\n00:10:15.242 --> 00:10:20.720\nI find the container.plist, right,\nthe preferences for the container.\n\n197\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.240\nAnd then I see a data folder and\nI go into that data folder, and\n\n198\n00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.080\nI look, look what I see.\n\n199\n00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.290\nDesktop, documents, downloads,\nlibrary, movies, music, pictures.\n\n200\n00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.250\nThis looks like my home folder.\n\n201\n00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:37.060\nRight, but see how some of these\nfolders are pink, those are links.\n\n202\n00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.760\nIf I look at the full output, see how all\nthe pink ones are just linked back to my\n\n203\n00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.070\nactual desktop folder, downloads,\nmovies, music, pictures.\n\n204\n00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.060\nBut not library and not documents.\n\n205\n00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.574\nThose are protected or for\nthis application, they are protected.\n\n206\n00:10:52.574 --> 00:10:56.439\nSo when Outlook goes to\nlook at its preferences,\n\n207\n00:10:56.439 --> 00:11:00.872\nit doesn't go to the normal\n/Library/Preferences,\n\n208\n00:11:00.872 --> 00:11:05.608\nit goes to its own library and\npreferences folder, right?\n\n209\n00:11:05.608 --> 00:11:10.700\nSo now I'm in\n/User/dpezet/Library/Containers/com.micro-\n\n210\n00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.530\nsoft.Outlook/Data/Library/Preferences.\n\n211\n00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.650\nI mean, that's a mouthful.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n212\n00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:17.994\n&gt;&gt; But when I look in there,\n\n213\n00:11:17.994 --> 00:11:21.262\nhere's the preference files and\nI haven't run Outlook, so\n\n214\n00:11:21.262 --> 00:11:23.904\nit hasn't created its\nown preference file yet.\n\n215\n00:11:23.904 --> 00:11:26.480\nBut I see the Apple security once and\nso on.\n\n216\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.810\nBy doing this,\nApple can control the permissions and\n\n217\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:35.250\ndictate who's allowed to see what and\nstop one program from accessing another.\n\n218\n00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.347\nSo if you're ever looking around\nin the preferences folder, and\n\n219\n00:11:38.347 --> 00:11:42.090\nyou can't find the preferences program,\nit's likely been sandbox.\n\n220\n00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:46.902\nAnd so, what you need to do\nis look into your home folder\n\n221\n00:11:46.902 --> 00:11:51.700\nin /Library/Containers and you'll likely\nfind the container for that application.\n\n222\n00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.270\nThat is a big part of something to change.\n\n223\n00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.010\nSo 64-bit applications,\nthey take advantage of this.\n\n224\n00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.190\nThey have access to more memory,\nmore performance.\n\n225\n00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.310\nThey have additional\nsecurity features like this.\n\n226\n00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.280\nWe have gatekeeper.\n\n227\n00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.370\nAll these are different things that\nMac OS is doing the background,\n\n228\n00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:12.420\nprotect your applications and stop them\nfrom being tampered with and ensure\n\n229\n00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.516\nthat their data maintains its integrity.\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, how can we see what\n\n230\n00:12:15.516 --> 00:12:18.593\napplications are installed in our system?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n231\n00:12:18.593 --> 00:12:21.955\nthat's where it starts to get a little\nbit tricky because you're gonna have some\n\n232\n00:12:21.955 --> 00:12:23.792\napplications that might be in a container.\n\n233\n00:12:23.792 --> 00:12:26.256\nYou have some applications that might not,\nand\n\n234\n00:12:26.256 --> 00:12:30.560\nmight have some applications inside\nof the /Applications folder.\n\n235\n00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.620\nI might have applications inside\nof my home folder /Applications.\n\n236\n00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.080\nApplications just should be all over the\nplace, they can be in my documents folder,\n\n237\n00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.660\nthey can be in the wrong place but\nstill work.\n\n238\n00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.890\nWhen an application gets installed in\nMac OS, it has to register itself.\n\n239\n00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.240\nAnd when it registers itself,\nit doesn't really matter the location,\n\n240\n00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.190\nit can be anywhere on the drive but\nyou register itself with Mac OS, so\n\n241\n00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.580\nit knows that it's there.\n\n242\n00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.210\nAnd if we wanna see all of our\napplications in one place,\n\n243\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.540\nthe best way to do that is with\nthe system information utility.\n\n244\n00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.420\nIf I fire up the system\ninformation utility and\n\n245\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.400\nwe have seen this in a few episodes.\n\n246\n00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.620\nThe easiest way to get to it is well,\nI use spotlight to pull it up.\n\n247\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.400\nBut you can go to your Apple menu and\nchoose about this Mac.\n\n248\n00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.660\nAnd under about this Mac,\nyou can hit system report.\n\n249\n00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.060\nAnd that will take you\nto system information.\n\n250\n00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.480\nWe pulled this up in\nthe hardware episodes.\n\n251\n00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.090\nBut if you ignore hardware and\nignore network, right beneath it,\n\n252\n00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.670\nyou've got software.\n\n253\n00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.320\nAnd right here,\nyou can choose applications, and\n\n254\n00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.110\nit will pull up a list of the applications\nthat are installed in your system.\n\n255\n00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.090\nNow, I've click on it, and it looks\nlike it's sitting here doing nothing.\n\n256\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.950\nBut down at the bottom right,\nthere's actually a spinning wheel, it\n\n257\n00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.550\ntakes a little while and it's gonna figure\nout all the applications that I've got.\n\n258\n00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.370\nAnd so now,\n\n259\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:45.130\nI can see right here all the applications\nI've actually got installed in the system.\n\n260\n00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.350\nOne's from Apple,\none's from the App Store, and\n\n261\n00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:52.580\none's from third parties and\nI can see the location where it's stored.\n\n262\n00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.740\nSo for example, AJA Mini-Config, that's\nan application that I downloaded and\n\n263\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.820\nI installed it.\n\n264\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.480\nAnd it tells me right here,\nhey, it's a 64-bit app, right.\n\n265\n00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.420\nSo I know it's 64-bit, I know it's\ngonna work in new versions of Mac OS.\n\n266\n00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.160\nI can see that it's in\nthe /Applications folder.\n\n267\n00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.630\nThat's where it's installed to and\nI can see who wrote the thing and\n\n268\n00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.330\na little more information about it.\n\n269\n00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.860\nI can continue to look for\nother applications like that.\n\n270\n00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.505\nI think I used ForkLift in one episode,\nlet me find that.\n\n271\n00:14:17.505 --> 00:14:21.414\nHere's ForkLift,\nI can see that it's 64-bit, good to go.\n\n272\n00:14:21.414 --> 00:14:24.570\nIt's stored in /Applications.\n\n273\n00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:29.100\nOther ones, you know as you poke around,\nyou may find ones that aren't 64-bit and\n\n274\n00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.350\nthat'll be a big warning sign to you.\n\n275\n00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.500\nLike shoot, that's one I need\nto get in here and update.\n\n276\n00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.550\nYou've got this obtained from\ncolumn which incredibly handy.\n\n277\n00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.570\nI usually take this and\nsort it, by obtained from\n\n278\n00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.250\nbecause the ones that say Apple, those\nare part of the operating system, right?\n\n279\n00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.790\nSo I'm not really gonna be worried\nabout any application from there.\n\n280\n00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.320\nBut when you get towards\nthe bottom of the list,\n\n281\n00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.420\nyou'll find the ones, oops, getting all\nover the place, better from the App Store.\n\n282\n00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.280\nThe App Store once have at\nleast been reviewed by Apple so\n\n283\n00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.510\nthose should be pretty safe too.\n\n284\n00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.820\nAnd you can see all these various\nones that I've either purchased from\n\n285\n00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.110\nthe App Store and download it, so\nit'll take like Pixelmator as an example.\n\n286\n00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.440\nSo it's already 64-bit,\nI can see already installed.\n\n287\n00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.650\nBut then I start getting\ninto the unknowns.\n\n288\n00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.140\nRight, these guys that came\nin from who-knows-where.\n\n289\n00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.130\nThose are ones I downloaded\nfrom the Internet.\n\n290\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.320\nSo right here I can get a summary\nof all the applications that I have\n\n291\n00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.510\nthat didn't come from Apple.\n\n292\n00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.200\nSo for example, RECentral, all right.\n\n293\n00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.750\nRECentral is a program that works with\na little capture utility that I have,\n\n294\n00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.590\na video capture utility.\n\n295\n00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.923\nAnd if I click on RECentral,\nlook right here.\n\n296\n00:15:35.923 --> 00:15:39.082\n64-bit Intel, no.\n\n297\n00:15:39.082 --> 00:15:43.740\nIt's not a 64-bit application,\nit's a 32-bit application, right?\n\n298\n00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.010\nAnd let me tell the worst part here, it's\nmade by the company called AVerMedia, and\n\n299\n00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.030\nthey're not gonna release\n64-bit version of it.\n\n300\n00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:54.577\nWhich means, when the next version of\nMac OS comes out, this $300 capture card I\n\n301\n00:15:54.577 --> 00:15:56.336\nhave is no longer going to work.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n302\n00:15:56.336 --> 00:15:58.115\n&gt;&gt; So that happens.\n\n303\n00:15:58.115 --> 00:16:02.403\nAnd I'll have to make a decision at\nthat point, either don't upgrade, which,\n\n304\n00:16:02.403 --> 00:16:04.053\nupgrade, so that's a given.\n\n305\n00:16:04.053 --> 00:16:07.037\nOr get a new capture card,\nwhich I'll have to do.\n\n306\n00:16:07.037 --> 00:16:09.059\nSo that unfortunately does happen,\n\n307\n00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:12.067\nI don't know why they chose\nnot to do a 64 diversion.\n\n308\n00:16:12.067 --> 00:16:14.191\nWhen there's hardware drivers involve,\n\n309\n00:16:14.191 --> 00:16:17.460\nit's much more difficult to\ngo from 32 bit to 64 bit.\n\n310\n00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.142\nIf it's just software though, it's easy.\n\n311\n00:16:19.142 --> 00:16:22.954\nAnd so you'll see where most of them\nhave already made that change but\n\n312\n00:16:22.954 --> 00:16:24.409\nnot every developer has.\n\n313\n00:16:24.409 --> 00:16:28.090\nSo definitely something to watch out for\nDisk Inventory X,\n\n314\n00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:33.180\nas the utility, I use to see what files\nare eating up the most of my disk space.\n\n315\n00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.870\nAnd I can see right here,\nit's telling me 64-Bit Intel, no.\n\n316\n00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.750\nI need to get a 64-Bit version.\n\n317\n00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.420\nThat's not critical software for me.\n\n318\n00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.730\nSo I have to reach out to that developer,\nso\n\n319\n00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.960\nI'm not sure if they're\ngonna do a 64-bit one.\n\n320\n00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.212\nBut we can see it right there and know\nthat I probably do need to worry about it.\n\n321\n00:16:49.212 --> 00:16:52.350\nSo kinda cool that we can see it,\nthat you get every application,\n\n322\n00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:53.490\nregardless of where it's stored,\n\n323\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.669\nwill show up right here in this list.\n&gt;&gt; So Don, how can we see what\n\n324\n00:16:56.669 --> 00:16:59.741\napplications are running on our system?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so,\n\n325\n00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:03.826\nthese are applications that are sitting on\nmy disk, not necessarily running, right?\n\n326\n00:17:03.826 --> 00:17:07.410\nIf we want to see what's running, that's\nwhere the activity monitor comes in.\n\n327\n00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.710\nAnd if you fire it up, it's inside\nof your Applications folder and\n\n328\n00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.190\nthen inside of the Utilities\nfolder from there.\n\n329\n00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.255\nBut I usually choose spotlight and\npull up the Activity Monitor.\n\n330\n00:17:16.255 --> 00:17:19.500\nHere's all the programs\nthat are actively running.\n\n331\n00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.440\nNow, if this is the first time you've\nlaunched the Activity Monitor, up top,\n\n332\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.310\nyou'll wanna click on View.\n\n333\n00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.750\nBecause it defaults to My Processes,\nin other words,\n\n334\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.650\nprograms that you're running, right?\n\n335\n00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.540\nNot necessarily other users or the system.\n\n336\n00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.750\nSo I'll usually switch to all processes.\n\n337\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.728\nNow when you do that,\nyou'll see everything.\n\n338\n00:17:38.728 --> 00:17:42.120\nNot just the applications but\neven services and\n\n339\n00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.680\nthe operating system\nrunning in the background.\n\n340\n00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.620\nYou see a lot.\n\n341\n00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.270\nBut in that View menu,\nyou can change and tell it, hey,\n\n342\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.920\njust show me the windowed processes.\n\n343\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.630\nWindowed processes are what we normally\nthink of as applications and so I can see,\n\n344\n00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:57.210\nhey, I'm running TextEdit,\nTerminal, System Information,\n\n345\n00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.500\nActivity Monitor and\nhere's the load that they are creating.\n\n346\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.486\nSo a good way to see those but it is\njust showing the ones that I'm running.\n\n347\n00:18:04.486 --> 00:18:07.267\nIf I wanna see ones that\neverybody's running,\n\n348\n00:18:07.267 --> 00:18:11.088\nthen we have to get a little more\ncomplex and go to all processes and\n\n349\n00:18:11.088 --> 00:18:14.060\nkinda sift through it that way so.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n350\n00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.508\n&gt;&gt; So quick way though we can see what's\n\n351\n00:18:15.508 --> 00:18:17.735\nrunning, get an idea of what's in place.\n&gt;&gt; What do I\n\n352\n00:18:17.735 --> 00:18:21.545\ndo if I spot a misbehaving application?\n&gt;&gt; So if your system starts to get\n\n353\n00:18:21.545 --> 00:18:24.841\na little slow and clumsy, we talk about it\nmore in the troubleshooting episode but\n\n354\n00:18:24.841 --> 00:18:25.749\njust really quickly,\n\n355\n00:18:25.749 --> 00:18:29.080\nlet's say I've got an application\nlike my terminal in the background.\n\n356\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.760\nI'll switch back to Windows processes.\n\n357\n00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.730\nIf my terminal at the background is\ncausing a problem, you can click on it and\n\n358\n00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.020\nyou can terminate the application, right?\n\n359\n00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:43.625\nSo I've got a little stop button up here,\nthat says Force a process to quit.\n\n360\n00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:46.040\nSo I can tell the system, hey,\nI want you to close this thing.\n\n361\n00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.232\nThere's a menu option for\nit as well but the button right here\n\n362\n00:18:49.232 --> 00:18:53.631\nis usually suitable and I can hit that and\nit's gonna say am I sure, I wanna do that?\n\n363\n00:18:53.631 --> 00:18:54.598\nI'll say, yep, do it.\n\n364\n00:18:54.598 --> 00:18:55.305\nForce quit.\n\n365\n00:18:55.305 --> 00:18:58.635\nAnd in the background,\nyou see my terminal went away.\n\n366\n00:18:58.635 --> 00:19:01.195\nYou'll get that with\napplications sometimes where,\n\n367\n00:19:01.195 --> 00:19:03.410\nlet me fire the terminal backup again.\n\n368\n00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:08.090\nAnd down here in my doc, I'll have that\nicon and if I two finger tap it and\n\n369\n00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.510\ngo to Quit, it will try and close it.\n\n370\n00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:14.749\nBut if it's stuck, if it's lock and\nI choose quit again and it will say,\n\n371\n00:19:14.749 --> 00:19:16.640\ndo you wanna force quit it?\n\n372\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.230\nRight, so it'll give you that option.\n\n373\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:22.860\nIf it doesn't give you the option, you can\nhold down the Option key on your keyboard.\n\n374\n00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.430\nSee what happens when I hold that option?\n\n375\n00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.782\nQuit becomes Force Quit, right?\n\n376\n00:19:26.782 --> 00:19:30.525\nSo a little hard to see,\nbut it's changing that one.\n\n377\n00:19:30.525 --> 00:19:32.385\nAnd so I can tell it to Force Quit,\n\n378\n00:19:32.385 --> 00:19:36.850\neven if it's the first time that I'm doing\nit and then I can relaunch terminal.\n\n379\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.900\nIt'll try to recover that session and\nput me right back where I was.\n\n380\n00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.580\nSo a couple of different ways if\nan application is going crazy but\n\n381\n00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:47.830\nthat fixes the symptom, not the cause,\nso why did the application go crazy.\n\n382\n00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.251\nI might need to reinstall it.\n\n383\n00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:52.996\nI might need to delete the application and\nreinstall it or find out what happened,\n\n384\n00:19:52.996 --> 00:19:55.071\ndig through my system logs and\nother things.\n\n385\n00:19:55.071 --> 00:19:58.065\nAnd for that, you want to jump over\nto our troubleshooting episodes.\n\n386\n00:19:58.065 --> 00:20:01.210\nThey are at the end of the series and\nwe walk through how to troubleshoot\n\n387\n00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.570\napplications and a few other things to\ntry and figure out what went wrong and\n\n388\n00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.360\nget that system back up and going.\n&gt;&gt; Well, speaking of troubleshooting,\n\n389\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.650\nis there any way to find\nout why the app went rogue?\n\n390\n00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:10.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n391\n00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.040\nif I was left to my own devices and\nI had to figure out what happened,\n\n392\n00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.860\nthe application itself might give you\nan error but a lot of times they don't.\n\n393\n00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:23.200\nSo that's normally where I'm going to\njump to a utility called the console.\n\n394\n00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.230\nConsole is found inside of\n/applications/utilities and\n\n395\n00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.840\nit is a log,\na log of what's going on on your system.\n\n396\n00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.770\nAnd I know we've brought this up\nin some other episodes as well but\n\n397\n00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.280\nyou can see what those\napplications are doing.\n\n398\n00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.530\nAnd if there was an error, if there was a\nfault of some sort, it'll show up in here.\n\n399\n00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:46.350\nNow some applications are really good\nabout maintaining their own log files, so\n\n400\n00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:50.060\nif you browse around in here,\nyou might be able to find where has it's\n\n401\n00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:54.240\nown separate log file but\nif it doesn't, then it's just gonna\n\n402\n00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.160\nbe integrated with the rest of\nthe logs and let the search for it.\n\n403\n00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.168\nSo, if I look under /Library and\n\n404\n00:20:59.168 --> 00:21:03.115\n/Logs here I find a Microsoft is\nseparating out their own logs and\n\n405\n00:21:03.115 --> 00:21:08.313\nthat's nice cuz now I can find them in one\nplace but plenty of other programs aren't.\n\n406\n00:21:08.313 --> 00:21:11.020\nPulse SMS level,\ntext message program I use.\n\n407\n00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.970\nA few other things here showing\nup under my logs but that's it.\n\n408\n00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.540\nSo other applications like\nthe terminal aren't showing up there.\n\n409\n00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:23.470\nSo when we first pull this up,\nit might be too much information.\n\n410\n00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.910\nSo up top,\nyou can use this search field and\n\n411\n00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:29.800\nyou can type in whatever the application\nname is that you're having a problem with.\n\n412\n00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.530\nAnd you can search based on that.\n\n413\n00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.324\nAnd it'll look and try and find it.\n\n414\n00:21:33.324 --> 00:21:36.058\nBe aware that you might\nhave the casing wrong,\n\n415\n00:21:36.058 --> 00:21:39.190\nlike capital letter\nversus lower case letter.\n\n416\n00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.340\nThe name of the program might be wrong,\nthings like that.\n\n417\n00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.170\nSo you might need to\ntweak it a little bit.\n\n418\n00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.950\nA lot of times, I'll come in and\njust search for the word error.\n\n419\n00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.170\nBecause hey, who knows what\nthe application might be called,\n\n420\n00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.620\nI'll search for error and\nsee if I can find that and\n\n421\n00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.580\nyou can get information that way and\nstart to find out what's going on.\n\n422\n00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.430\nI've got some kind of decoding\ncompleted with errors message up here.\n\n423\n00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:03.060\nSo I can look and\npossibly get some more information and\n\n424\n00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.630\nfigure what the cause of that problem is.\n\n425\n00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:09.140\nSo the console utility, really handy for\ntrying to find what the actual cause of\n\n426\n00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.910\nyour problem was.\n&gt;&gt; And another great episode,\n\n427\n00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.510\nApplication Support Part Three.\n\n428\n00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.420\nMake sure you see parts one,\ntwo and three, importante.\n\n429\n00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.588\nAnd before we move on, Don,\n\n430\n00:22:17.588 --> 00:22:19.417\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n431\n00:22:19.417 --> 00:22:21.890\nwe definitely started to weigh in to\nthe troubleshooting models there.\n\n432\n00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:23.650\nSo make sure you check out\nthe troubleshooting episodes.\n\n433\n00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:24.450\nBut otherwise,\n\n434\n00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:28.440\nI think we did a good job of covering\nthe weird applications that occur.\n\n435\n00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.550\nObviously, there's even\nweirder ones that are just so\n\n436\n00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.640\nedge case that we don't worry about.\n\n437\n00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.070\nYour mileage may vary but\n\n438\n00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.770\nI think we cover them pretty\nmuch in the order of occurence.\n\n439\n00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:43.910\nJava, pretty common, iCloud integration\nbecoming more common, voice integration,\n\n440\n00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:47.540\npretty common, once we get into things\nlike the sand boxing and so on.\n\n441\n00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.450\nIt's common but\nwe don't usually have problems with it.\n\n442\n00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.942\nSo each of these were exceptions\nas to how applications work and\n\n443\n00:22:52.942 --> 00:22:54.510\nhopefully you have a better idea of this.\n\n444\n00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:58.220\nSo when you see odd behavior it a program,\nnow you can match it up\n\n445\n00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.619\nto why it's behaving that way.\n&gt;&gt; Great job as usual Don.\n\n446\n00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:02.604\nYou wanna make sure you\nwatch every episode of\n\n447\n00:23:02.604 --> 00:23:05.906\nApple Certified Support Professional,\nyou're gonna be so glad you did.\n\n448\n00:23:05.906 --> 00:23:09.654\nAnd you'll be in the course library where\nthere's other videos there designed to do\n\n449\n00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:12.840\none thing, help you go further,\nso check those out as well.\n\n450\n00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.320\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n451\n00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.481\nThanks for watching I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n452\n00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:20.839\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n453\n00:23:20.839 --> 00:23:26.683\n[MUSIC]\n\n454\n00:23:26.683 --> 00:23:30.092\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

you go.\n\n9\n00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.467\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n10\n00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:20.896\nAs we continue on with\nApple Certified Support Professional,\n\n11\n00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:24.647\nwe are going to be doing network\nconfiguration with the one and only,\n\n12\n00:00:24.647 --> 00:00:28.964\ndrum roll, please, Don Pezet.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right-\n\n13\n00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:29.633\n&gt;&gt; There was no drum roll.\n\n14\n00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.041\n&gt;&gt; I know, I feel like I'm supposed to do\n\n15\n00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:33.069\na little dance or sparkle thing,\njazz hands, right?\n\n16\n00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:34.062\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:35.148\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, well,\n\n18\n00:00:35.148 --> 00:00:39.000\njust like Zach said, we are doing\nnetwork configuration in this episode.\n\n19\n00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.650\nI know that I said in some of\nthe earlier episodes that by and\n\n20\n00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.320\nlarge macOS automatically\nconfigured your network so\n\n21\n00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.880\nyou don't have to do\na whole heck of a lot.\n\n22\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.440\nBut that is not always true, especially\nwhen you're dealing with enterprise or\n\n23\n00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.300\nlarge business type networks,\nuniversities,\n\n24\n00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.930\nthere often is a bit of configuration we\nhave to do to get our network set up.\n\n25\n00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.910\nAnd so, in this episode, we're gonna take\na look at what network configuration looks\n\n26\n00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.740\nlike, what the different things\nare that we need to be aware of.\n\n27\n00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.230\nHow addressing works, and\neven basic network communications.\n\n28\n00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.380\nNow, if you've already, let's say,\nyou're Network+ certified,\n\n29\n00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.590\nthen a lot of this stuff you're\nalready going to know, but\n\n30\n00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.110\nwe need to cover at least the basics here\nto make sure that everybody is exam ready.\n\n31\n00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.032\nOn the exam, they expect you to\nunderstand how addressing works and\n\n32\n00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:21.912\na few other things.\n\n33\n00:01:21.912 --> 00:01:24.644\nNot just, here is where I\ngo to Internet address, but\n\n34\n00:01:24.644 --> 00:01:26.790\nunderstand why the address is what it is.\n\n35\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.605\nAnd so we're gonna cover all of that,\n\n36\n00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:32.166\nstarting right here in this episode.\n&gt;&gt; So Don, what type of network\n\n37\n00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:35.923\nconnections does macOS support?\n&gt;&gt; All right, now that is part of why\n\n38\n00:01:35.923 --> 00:01:39.901\nthis is so complex, because macOS supports\nmany different types of networks.\n\n39\n00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:43.051\nAnd for most people,\nthere is going to be one big one,\n\n40\n00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:46.559\nwhich is a wifi network,\nright, Wi-Fi or 802.11.\n\n41\n00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:51.060\nLet me clarify that,\nan IEEE 802.11 wireless network.\n\n42\n00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.840\nThose are wireless networks that\nare standardized by the IEEE.\n\n43\n00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.895\nThat is an international organization\nthat creates, well, standards.\n\n44\n00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:02.229\nIt's an organization of\nelectrical engineers,\n\n45\n00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.954\nI forget what all of the Es stand for.\n\n46\n00:02:03.954 --> 00:02:07.971\nBut basically they say, here is\na standard method of communication,\n\n47\n00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:10.664\nthe two systems are gonna use to talk.\n\n48\n00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:13.522\nAnd those Wi-Fi networks\nare wildly popular,\n\n49\n00:02:13.522 --> 00:02:16.524\npeople use them at home,\nat work, at Starbucks,\n\n50\n00:02:16.524 --> 00:02:20.965\nat the sports stadium, all over\nthe place you see those Wi-Fi networks.\n\n51\n00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:24.400\nThat is the number one way that\nwe're going to communicate.\n\n52\n00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.590\nIn fact, when you buy a Mac,\nsome of the newer Macs,\n\n53\n00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.710\nthe Wi-Fi network is the only thing they\nhave built into them, that's the way.\n\n54\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.365\nBut there are still plenty of\nmacs like Mac Minis and iMac, and\n\n55\n00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:41.010\nMac Pros, that still have ethernet or\nphysical network jacks on them,\n\n56\n00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.280\nso you can plug in that link and\nget connected that way.\n\n57\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.610\nThat's gonna give you the most stable and\n\n58\n00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.140\nfastest communication which is really\ngood, but it's becoming less and\n\n59\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.490\nless common, because, well,\nyou gotta run a cable.\n\n60\n00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.520\nSo for example,\n\n61\n00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.810\nmy MacBook is a newer MacBook, it doesn't\neven have a physical network jack on it.\n\n62\n00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.170\nI can't plug a cable in.\n\n63\n00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.330\nI'd have to get an adapter,\n\n64\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.780\njust stick that on there which\nyou certainly can, right.\n\n65\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.690\nThose are available.\n\n66\n00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.120\nThere's also some of the older\nstandards like FireWire.\n\n67\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.010\nFireWire is still supported by macOS.\n\n68\n00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.480\nAlthough I don't think any Mac sold\ntoday has a FireWire jack on it anymore.\n\n69\n00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.280\nSo we are seeing FireWire go away.\n\n70\n00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.540\nIt's being replaced\nlargely by Thunderbolt.\n\n71\n00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.450\nAnd Thunderbolt is a, well, I always\nthink of Thunderbolt as storage, like,\n\n72\n00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.460\nhey, I've got a Thunderbolt hard drive,\nI'll pop it on there.\n\n73\n00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.390\nOr a display, a monitor,\nthat uses Thunderbolt and\n\n74\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.040\nI'll plug that in, but\nThunderbolt can do networking as well.\n\n75\n00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.790\nWe can actually communicate across it.\n\n76\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.000\nSo it's yet another network type.\n\n77\n00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.640\nWho else am I leaving out?\n\n78\n00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.770\nA big one here, Bluetooth.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n79\n00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.940\n&gt;&gt; Bluetooth, which\n\n80\n00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.350\nyou might connect a keyboard,\na mouse, your cellphone.\n\n81\n00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.263\nYou might tether your cellphone\nto your laptop, with Bluetooth.\n\n82\n00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:54.870\nBluetooth is a networking connection type.\n\n83\n00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.500\nIt's different than an 802.11 network\nin the way that it functions, Bluetooth\n\n84\n00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.680\nfunctions on a different frequency, and\nso that's yet another network type.\n\n85\n00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.880\nAll of these are different networks that\nare all natively supported by macOS.\n\n86\n00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.780\nSo when you go in to configure your\nnetwork, you may see one, or two, or\n\n87\n00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.664\nall of the ones that I just mentioned.\n&gt;&gt; Are they all configured the same way?\n\n88\n00:04:15.664 --> 00:04:17.280\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes, yes.\n\n89\n00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.870\nSometimes, no.\n\n90\n00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.990\nSo there's a couple different\nprotocols that are out there.\n\n91\n00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.750\nWhen you communicate over the network,\n\n92\n00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.990\nI don't wanna go too crazy into\nthe technical details, but\n\n93\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.680\nthere's this whole seven layer OSIM model\nthat gets kind of thrown into the frame.\n\n94\n00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.650\nAnd at the very first layer,\nyou're talking about the hardware.\n\n95\n00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.460\nSo, if it's a physical network,\nyou've got a copper cable.\n\n96\n00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.630\nIf it's a wireless network,\n\n97\n00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.130\nyou've got a wireless antenna and\nthat's what makes up that first layer.\n\n98\n00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.760\nAnd the second layer is the basic\naddressing that you use to communicate.\n\n99\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.960\nAnd so, in a Wi-Fi network that\nwould be the 802.11 A-B-G-N-A-C.\n\n100\n00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.612\nSeems like I left one out.\n\n101\n00:04:53.612 --> 00:04:58.635\nAnyhow, one of those crazy wireless\nstandards on a copper network,\n\n102\n00:04:58.635 --> 00:05:01.240\nit would be the ethernet protocol.\n\n103\n00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.915\nThat's what happens at layer two.\n\n104\n00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:06.717\nAnd then when you get to layer three,\nthough, that's where things start\n\n105\n00:05:06.717 --> 00:05:10.290\nto become the same across all\nof the different network types.\n\n106\n00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:16.410\nSo for example the most common\nnetwork protocol on the entire planet,\n\n107\n00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.320\nis a protocol called IP,\nthe Internet Protocol, right?\n\n108\n00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.657\nIP, actually there's 2 different versions\nright now, there's IP version 4 and\n\n109\n00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:25.460\nIP version 6.\n\n110\n00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.927\nAnd it is supported across bluetooth,\nWi-Fi, ethernet, fiber.\n\n111\n00:05:31.927 --> 00:05:33.370\nI didn't even mention fiber a minute ago.\n\n112\n00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.548\nYou'll see fiber in some networks.\n\n113\n00:05:34.548 --> 00:05:38.391\nIt usually is running ethernet, though,\nso it kind of gets grouped together.\n\n114\n00:05:38.391 --> 00:05:41.912\nBut you see IP used in\na lot of different places.\n\n115\n00:05:41.912 --> 00:05:43.300\nIP stands for Internet Protocol.\n\n116\n00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.270\nIt was designed for the Internet, but\nit's used in a lot of other areas.\n\n117\n00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.850\nSo when you tether your cell phone\nto your laptop using Bluetooth,\n\n118\n00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.910\nit's actually using an IP network\nbetween the two to talk, to communicate.\n\n119\n00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.260\nWhen you fire up your laptop and\n\n120\n00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.440\nyou connect to a Time Capsule on your\nnetwork to do Time Machine backups,\n\n121\n00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.920\nit's using an IP network to communicate,\nto talk back and forth.\n\n122\n00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.671\nSo that's used across them and\nthat is considered really set up the same,\n\n123\n00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:13.225\neven though the network\ntype might be different.\n\n124\n00:06:13.225 --> 00:06:16.181\nBut there are other protocols\nthat are out there, right?\n\n125\n00:06:16.181 --> 00:06:18.812\nApple used to use a protocol\ncalled AppleTalk.\n\n126\n00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:22.283\nAnd AppleTalk is set up\ndifferently than IP.\n\n127\n00:06:22.283 --> 00:06:28.181\nSo AppleTalk was designed just for Apple\nnetworks, IP was designed for everything.\n\n128\n00:06:28.181 --> 00:06:32.523\nThere's NetBIOS which was used\nin Microsoft or Windows worlds.\n\n129\n00:06:32.523 --> 00:06:36.258\nAnd NetBIOS is actually supported by\na number of platforms including macOS.\n\n130\n00:06:36.258 --> 00:06:40.234\nYou won't see it in the GUI, but\nin the background support is still there,\n\n131\n00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:43.093\nApple's maintained\nthe backwards compatibility.\n\n132\n00:06:43.093 --> 00:06:46.453\nThere's other ones like VPNs,\nVirtual Private Networks and\n\n133\n00:06:46.453 --> 00:06:47.883\neven dialogue networks.\n\n134\n00:06:47.883 --> 00:06:50.045\nPeople still use dialogue and\nthere is PPP,\n\n135\n00:06:50.045 --> 00:06:53.050\nthe Point to Point Protocol\nthat's used for it.\n\n136\n00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.118\nEach of these protocols are configured\na slightly different way.\n\n137\n00:06:57.118 --> 00:07:01.410\nBut we don't set up the protocol by\nitself, you set up the interface first.\n\n138\n00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.087\nAnd then once you're on the interface,\n\n139\n00:07:03.087 --> 00:07:06.246\nyou'll see the protocols that\nare supported, there's usually only one or\n\n140\n00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:08.732\ntwo, and then you can go and\nyou can configure each of them.\n\n141\n00:07:08.732 --> 00:07:13.237\nSo that the general steps for how we can\nconfigure these networks is the same, but\n\n142\n00:07:13.237 --> 00:07:17.691\nthere will be specific variations\ndepending on which protocols we're using.\n\n143\n00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:19.110\nWe've gotta be familiar with those.\n\n144\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.930\nNow, on the exam,\nthey only want you to know IP, right?\n\n145\n00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.180\nSo the Internet Protocol,\nthat's the one they want you to know,\n\n146\n00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.260\nbecause that's the one that's\nused 98% of the time out there.\n\n147\n00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.010\nBut the other protocols do still exist,\nthey are still available and\n\n148\n00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.260\nyou may need to read up on them if you're\ngonna be using them in your environment.\n\n149\n00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.600\n&gt;&gt; What about TCPIP,\n\n150\n00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.920\nisn't that the most popular?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n151\n00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.470\nI said that IP was most popular but TCP/IP\nis what you hear a lot of people say.\n\n152\n00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:48.246\nIP by itself will help you find another\ncomputer, so using Internet Protocol,\n\n153\n00:07:48.246 --> 00:07:52.467\nI can find Zach's laptop on the network,\nand now we can talk, right?\n\n154\n00:07:52.467 --> 00:07:56.226\nWell, no, IP just helps you find\nthe system, if you want to talk,\n\n155\n00:07:56.226 --> 00:08:01.064\nyou actually need something else, another\nthing stuck on it and Remembering that OSI\n\n156\n00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:04.854\nmodel this should actually be going\nup to layer four at this point.\n\n157\n00:08:04.854 --> 00:08:09.490\nWe have TCP, which is\nthe transmission control protocol.\n\n158\n00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.170\nAnd nine times out of ten,\n\n159\n00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.090\nwhen one computer is talking to another,\nthey're using TCP/IP.\n\n160\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:20.070\nThe transmission control protocol in\nconjunction with the Internet protocol.\n\n161\n00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.830\nWe use IP to find the system we want to\ntalk to and then we find TCP to actually\n\n162\n00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.530\ndo the talking to actually exchange that\ninformation and communicate it across.\n\n163\n00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.450\nTransmission control protocol is not\nthe only protocol that works like that,\n\n164\n00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.170\nthere is another one called UDP or\n\n165\n00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:40.860\nUser Datagram Protocol,\nit's not as common and let me explain why.\n\n166\n00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:47.850\nWith TCP, TCP is like,\nthey call it a reliable connection,\n\n167\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.990\nthat I have data, and\nI wanna send it to Zach.\n\n168\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.280\nAnd I wanna make sure it gets there.\n\n169\n00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.620\nSo I take my data, I write it up.\n\n170\n00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.910\nAnd then I hand it to Zach.\n\n171\n00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.010\nI say, Zach, here's this information.\n\n172\n00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.120\nAnd you look at it and\nmake sure it's okay?\n\n173\n00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.340\nAnd Zach looks at it and\nsays yeah it's fine.\n\n174\n00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.160\nI can read everything.\n\n175\n00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.859\nAnd I say good, right.\n\n176\n00:09:07.859 --> 00:09:10.090\nBut if he comes back and\nhe says it's actually really blurry Don.\n\n177\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.230\nI can't read it.\n\n178\n00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.290\nThen I say all right\nlet me write it again.\n\n179\n00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.610\nAnd let me send it again.\n\n180\n00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.250\nAnd we keep doing that\nuntil he says yes I got it.\n\n181\n00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.280\nSo transmission control protocol\nhas that kinda safety net.\n\n182\n00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.680\nIt makes sure that the data gets to\nwhere it's going and if it doesn't,\n\n183\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.530\nit retransmits.\n\n184\n00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.860\nUser datagram protocol,\nUDP, doesn't do that.\n\n185\n00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.129\nUDP is what's called\na best effort protocol.\n\n186\n00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.550\nI'm gonna make the best effort to\nget the data to the other end.\n\n187\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.383\nBut if it doesn't get there,\nI don't have time for that, I've moved on.\n\n188\n00:09:40.383 --> 00:09:41.438\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:09:41.438 --> 00:09:42.544\n&gt;&gt; And so, I try and\n\n190\n00:09:42.544 --> 00:09:44.053\nsend the data to Zach.\n\n191\n00:09:44.053 --> 00:09:46.123\nHey good luck Zach, I'm out of here.\n\n192\n00:09:46.123 --> 00:09:47.027\nAnd that's that.\n\n193\n00:09:47.027 --> 00:09:48.633\nMaybe he gets it maybe he doesn't.\n\n194\n00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:51.982\nNow you might be thinking to\nyourself that sounds pretty dumb.\n\n195\n00:09:51.982 --> 00:09:52.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n196\n00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.910\n&gt;&gt; Where would I use that?\n\n197\n00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.900\nImagine if I send an e-mail.\n\n198\n00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.210\nI have no idea if it actually\nmade it there or not.\n\n199\n00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.010\nIt just, maybe, right?\n\n200\n00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.440\nWho knows?\n\n201\n00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.180\nWe can't do that.\n\n202\n00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.780\nWe can't do that with most protocols.\n\n203\n00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.940\nBut there are some where you can.\n\n204\n00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.610\nSo, for example, let's say I'm\nwatching a football match on TV.\n\n205\n00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:19.340\nSo, I'm watching the game and\nwe need to clarify which football right?\n\n206\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.150\nBecause let's say they kick or\nthey throw the ball.\n\n207\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.330\nSo they kick the ball,\nthe ball is going through the air, right?\n\n208\n00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.970\nAnd I'm watching this,\nit's all streaming to my computer.\n\n209\n00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.050\nI'm watching, and all of a sudden I\ndrop a packet for some reason, right?\n\n210\n00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.240\nThe network's not stable,\nthings are congested.\n\n211\n00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.500\nSomething happens and\nI drop a packet, okay?\n\n212\n00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.530\nWell, if I'm using TCP,\ntransmission control protocol,\n\n213\n00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.930\nwhat happens is the video stops.\n\n214\n00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.780\nStops dead and says, I lost the packet,\ncan you retransmit it?\n\n215\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.910\nAnd the other side retransmits it and\n\n216\n00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.580\nall of the sudden I see\nthe ball start moving again.\n\n217\n00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.370\nBut while it was waiting,\nit was dark, right?\n\n218\n00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.310\nIt was getting that\npacket that was missed.\n\n219\n00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.670\nThat's not good if you're\nwatching a live sport.\n\n220\n00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.840\nYou've now gone back in time.\n\n221\n00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.950\nAnd if it happens over and over and\nover again, you're getting further and\n\n222\n00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:06.730\nfurther behind.\n\n223\n00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.020\nAnd all of a sudden you hear neighbor\nyelling cuz of the big score.\n\n224\n00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.850\nAnd it hasn't even happened yet\non your screen because you've gotten so\n\n225\n00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:13.410\nfar behind.\n\n226\n00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.880\nInstead, that ball's going across the air,\n\n227\n00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.850\nwe drop a packet, well, with UDP it can\njust say pew I'll just jump right in and\n\n228\n00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.380\nso the ball just jumps ahead just\na little bit and then off we go,\n\n229\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.890\nwe lost one frame then who cares right?\n\n230\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:33.050\nSome protocols are better off just\nskipping a packet and moving on.\n\n231\n00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:37.460\nStreaming audio, streaming video,\nvoice over IP, FaceTime.\n\n232\n00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.970\nProtocols like that they don't\nwant to stop and create a delay.\n\n233\n00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.368\nImagine a voice call,\n\n234\n00:11:43.368 --> 00:11:48.155\nit would be like talking to one of\nthose foreign correspondents and so\n\n235\n00:11:48.155 --> 00:11:52.942\nyou're the newscaster and you say let's\nreach out to Tom in the field, Tom,\n\n236\n00:11:52.942 --> 00:11:57.670\nwhat's it look like in the field?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.800\n&gt;&gt; Well, guys you know out here\n\n238\n00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.090\nthe sun is shining and\nwe got the umbrellas up.\n\n239\n00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.820\nThere's a big delay.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n240\n00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:03.640\n&gt;&gt; That's what happens so\n\n241\n00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:09.050\nUDP fixes that UDP is for fast, fast stuff\nwhen you don't care losing a little data.\n\n242\n00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.842\nNow, fortunately guess how hard\nit is to configure TCP and UDP?\n\n243\n00:12:12.842 --> 00:12:18.410\nIt isn't, we don't really configure those,\nthe systems they do that themselves.\n\n244\n00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.688\nWe're just responsible for the part\nof I need to find another computer on\n\n245\n00:12:21.688 --> 00:12:23.312\nthe network to be able to talk to it.\n\n246\n00:12:23.312 --> 00:12:26.563\nThat's the piece that starts to\ncreate a little bit of variation and\n\n247\n00:12:26.563 --> 00:12:28.341\nwe've got to get involved in there.\n\n248\n00:12:28.341 --> 00:12:32.175\nBut basically on the IP Side,\non the Internet Protocol side,\n\n249\n00:12:32.175 --> 00:12:35.580\nthat's where we'll do our configuration.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n250\n00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.790\n&gt;&gt; The TCP side, it sorts itself out.\n\n251\n00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.582\n&gt;&gt; So where does IPV4 and\n\n252\n00:12:40.582 --> 00:12:44.740\nIPV6 factor into all this?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so internet protocol,\n\n253\n00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.610\nthere's 2 versions.\n\n254\n00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.740\nVersion 4 and version 6.\n\n255\n00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.770\nNow, you might ask yourself what\nhappened to version one, two, three and\n\n256\n00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:50.350\nversion five.\n\n257\n00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.310\nBasically they don't exist\nat any meaningful form.\n\n258\n00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:59.070\nSo version one, two and three those are\nall developed in the 70s and early 80s and\n\n259\n00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.470\nwe're not what was widely distributed.\n\n260\n00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.101\nNobody actually runs those anymore.\n\n261\n00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:09.449\nIPv4 though, that's the one that\nthe Internet was built upon and\n\n262\n00:13:09.449 --> 00:13:13.379\nas a result,\neverybody supports IP version 4.\n\n263\n00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:16.680\nBut there's a little\nproblem with IP version 4.\n\n264\n00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.230\nIf you never work with the protocols,\nlet me back up just a little bit here and\n\n265\n00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.490\nI'm gonna show you an example.\n\n266\n00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:27.295\nSo an IPv4 address looks\nsomething like this.\n\n267\n00:13:27.295 --> 00:13:33.237\n192.168.0.1, that's an IP address right?\n\n268\n00:13:33.237 --> 00:13:37.999\nOr an IPv4 address, IPv4 all right.\n\n269\n00:13:37.999 --> 00:13:41.215\nSo that's an example of what\na standard IPv4 looks like.\n\n270\n00:13:41.215 --> 00:13:42.480\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n271\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.228\n&gt;&gt; What it actually is in the background,\n\n272\n00:13:45.228 --> 00:13:48.494\nwhat the computer sees is a 32-bit number.\n\n273\n00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:52.760\nA 32-bit, 32 ones and\nzeroes that make this up.\n\n274\n00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.540\nIf I were to write that in binary, let\nus see if I can do this one in my head.\n\n275\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.573\nSometimes I can.\n\n276\n00:14:01.682 --> 00:14:05.320\nAnd this is the most exciting\ntelevision you gonna watch today.\n\n277\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.113\nThere we go,\nare you sure I got that right?\n\n278\n00:14:09.113 --> 00:14:14.845\nSo, what we see is this 192.168.0.1,\n\n279\n00:14:14.845 --> 00:14:17.644\nwhat the computer sees is\n\n280\n00:14:17.644 --> 00:14:27.265\n11000000101010000000000000000000001.\n\n281\n00:14:27.265 --> 00:14:28.238\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; I think.\n\n282\n00:14:28.238 --> 00:14:31.438\nSo any now so that's it for the computer.\n\n283\n00:14:31.438 --> 00:14:33.500\nIt's a 32 bit address.\n\n284\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.190\nNow, if I ask you to memorize this\nnumber right here, that's pretty tough.\n\n285\n00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.120\nThat's not something\nthat's human readable.\n\n286\n00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.701\nSo, whoever created this, there's\ngotta be an easier way to write that.\n\n287\n00:14:43.701 --> 00:14:47.319\nAnd so,\nwhat they did is they took a number, and\n\n288\n00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:50.493\nthey broke it up into eight bit sections.\n\n289\n00:14:50.493 --> 00:14:55.396\nAnd these eight bit sections there we go,\nshoot,\n\n290\n00:14:55.396 --> 00:15:01.260\nI was short the,\nI'm short a few zeros on that there we go.\n\n291\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.280\nAll right.\n\n292\n00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.460\nFix my bad binary.\n\n293\n00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.240\nSo anyhow, they broke it up like this.\n\n294\n00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.290\nAnd by breaking it up,\nthat made it a little more readable.\n\n295\n00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.610\nBut we still have, actually, hang on.\n\n296\n00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.710\nNow I am screwing my number odds.\n\n297\n00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.050\nJust put this decimal in the wrong spot.\n\n298\n00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:21.038\nI was not actually short zeroes,\nI just had zeroes in the wrong spot,\n\n299\n00:15:21.038 --> 00:15:22.660\nthere, all right.\n\n300\n00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.851\nSo, [COUGH] what this did is it made\nthis a little more human readable.\n\n301\n00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:31.824\nBut if convert binary into decimal,\n\n302\n00:15:31.824 --> 00:15:38.382\nwhat I end up with is 192 168 0 1.\n\n303\n00:15:38.382 --> 00:15:41.680\nOr the 192.168.0.1 address\nthat we saw before.\n\n304\n00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.340\nNow, that's not even perfect there.\n\n305\n00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.100\nBut most people can memorize a ten\ndigit phone number pretty easy.\n\n306\n00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.613\nAn IP address like this at the most\nis gonna be twelve digits.\n\n307\n00:15:52.613 --> 00:15:55.673\nSo it's not much harder to\nremember than a phone number and\n\n308\n00:15:55.673 --> 00:15:57.910\nthat's why they broke it up this way.\n\n309\n00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.553\nThis one's actually shorter than a phone\nnumber because of the zero and the one.\n\n310\n00:16:01.553 --> 00:16:03.600\nBut it could be much, much larger.\n\n311\n00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.713\nSo point being here,\nis that it's a 32-bit number.\n\n312\n00:16:07.713 --> 00:16:13.220\nA 32-bit number can range from zero all\n\n313\n00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.320\nthe way up until where it's maxed out,\nwhere it's 32 1s in a row.\n\n314\n00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.930\nAnd if I did 32 1s in a row,\nthis would be a pretty big number.\n\n315\n00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.760\nThe number,\nwhich I don't have memorized but\n\n316\n00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.790\nI do have written on\na piece of paper here.\n\n317\n00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.994\nWhat actually ended up being\n\n318\n00:16:29.994 --> 00:16:39.994\n4,294,967,295.\n\n319\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.060\nSo basically, let's just say\n4.3 billion for my own sanity.\n\n320\n00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.195\nSo 4.3 billion possibilities.\n\n321\n00:16:48.195 --> 00:16:51.400\n[SOUND] That's a lot of addresses.\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot.\n\n322\n00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.220\n&gt;&gt; Now in the 1970s and the 1980s, they\n\n323\n00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:02.050\ncouldn't conceive of a world where there\nwere more than 4.3 billion computers.\n\n324\n00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.250\nYou have to remember back then,\ncomputers were huge, they were expansive.\n\n325\n00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:11.070\nEven the newer low cost ones\nlike the 10DS, the TRS80s and\n\n326\n00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:13.425\nstuff, even they were still expensive.\n&gt;&gt; They weren't cheap.\n\n327\n00:17:13.425 --> 00:17:15.330\n&gt;&gt; It' was unusual for\n\n328\n00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.630\na household to have\nmore than one computer.\n\n329\n00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.010\nYou got a household of five or\nsix people in it and just one computer.\n\n330\n00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.650\nThat was how it was back then.\n\n331\n00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.630\nSo they said look,\nthe Earth's population is 4.3 billion,\n\n332\n00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:31.640\nwith IPv4 every person on\nthe planet could have one address.\n\n333\n00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.790\nIt's perfect, let's go with it, right?\n\n334\n00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.320\nBut it didn't quite work out that way.\n\n335\n00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:42.400\nNow, it's not unusual for one person to be\neating up five six addresses, all right?\n\n336\n00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.920\nTake me for example, I've got my laptop,\n\n337\n00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.560\nI've got my cellphone, I've got a tablet,\nI've got a desktop back in my office,\n\n338\n00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.570\nI've got a desktop at home\nI've got a network printer.\n\n339\n00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:57.270\nI'm not even counting things like Rokus or\nApple TVs, Chromecast,\n\n340\n00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.660\nall these other network devices.\n\n341\n00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.680\nSecurity cameras,\nlike Nest cameras, Cloud cameras.\n\n342\n00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.060\nAs one person,\nI'm probably consuming 20 addresses.\n\n343\n00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.260\nIt's a lot, right?\n\n344\n00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.980\nAnd I'm just one person.\n\n345\n00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.060\nThe Earth's population is\nnow over 6 billion in size.\n\n346\n00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.110\nThis doesn't even give enough for\neverybody to have one address.\n\n347\n00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.660\nSo IPv4 ran out of addresses.\n\n348\n00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.980\nActually it ran out about a year ago.\n\n349\n00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.190\nThe big pools are out.\n\n350\n00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.330\nYou can still get addresses publicly,\nbut we're having to do all sorts of\n\n351\n00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:30.290\ncheating systems to try and get around\nhaving run out of the addresses.\n\n352\n00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:35.000\nAnd so that's the problem\nwith IPv4's address space.\n\n353\n00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.950\nSo the address space being 4.3 billion,\nthat holds it back.\n\n354\n00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:49.070\nAnd so about almost 20 years ago now,\nabout 18 years ago, they proposed IPv6.\n\n355\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:55.000\nNow, they had to skip IPv5 because there\nwas actually a trademark on IPv5 for\n\n356\n00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.650\nsome other unrelated products.\n\n357\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.530\nThey just skip it went to IPv6,\nso there is no IPv5.\n\n358\n00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:05.632\nBut with IPv6 they said man that 32-bit\nnumber before that was cool, right?\n\n359\n00:19:05.632 --> 00:19:07.360\nAnd they gave it 4.3 addresses.\n\n360\n00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.460\nSo, this number here was 32-bit, right?\n\n361\n00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.070\n32 ones and zeros.\n\n362\n00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.310\nWith IPv6 they said we don't\nwanna run out of space again,\n\n363\n00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.920\nwe wanna make sure we have\nenough space forever and ever.\n\n364\n00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.630\nAnd so they said, instead of doing 32-bit,\nlet's crank that upper notch.\n\n365\n00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.150\nAnd they did 128 bit.\n\n366\n00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:30.670\n128 bit, would look like that, all right?\n\n367\n00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:36.530\nThat is a 128 bit number right there,\nwrapped around my screen.\n\n368\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:40.090\nBecause the link to the number,\nit's a long number, right?\n\n369\n00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.185\nOops, that's not what I wanted.\n\n370\n00:19:42.185 --> 00:19:43.660\n[COUGH] It is a long number.\n\n371\n00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.560\nAnd that's the main thing that IPv6\nbrought us, was that 128-bit numbering.\n\n372\n00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.045\nAnd so that address space is way bigger.\n\n373\n00:19:52.045 --> 00:19:57.595\nThe IPv6 address space allows for\njust a few more addresses.\n\n374\n00:19:57.595 --> 00:19:59.395\nNot 4.3 million, right?\n\n375\n00:19:59.395 --> 00:20:00.635\nIt's a much much bigger one.\n\n376\n00:20:00.635 --> 00:20:03.705\nLet me write this one out here.\n\n377\n00:20:03.705 --> 00:20:05.423\nAgain, for my own sanity I'm\ngonna shorten this one up a bit.\n\n378\n00:20:05.423 --> 00:20:11.031\nBut it's basically 340\nundecillion address.\n\n379\n00:20:11.031 --> 00:20:12.846\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're doing the undecillions again?\n\n380\n00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:17.007\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Undecillion, yeah, I almost think they\n\n381\n00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:23.670\nhad to like make up a number for this one,\nit is a massive, massive address space.\n\n382\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:26.080\nAnd I'm just kinda writing it out here,\nfor\n\n383\n00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.210\nthose of you that are just\nlistening instead of watching.\n\n384\n00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.830\nYou won't see it, but I'm just\nkinda typing this out on my screen,\n\n385\n00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.080\nand It's probably going to wrap.\n\n386\n00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.760\nI'm getting close to the end now.\n\n387\n00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.831\nAs I write that, there we go.\n\n388\n00:20:38.831 --> 00:20:41.312\nS there it is, 340 undecillion addresses.\n\n389\n00:20:41.312 --> 00:20:48.500\nThat's how many addresses are in the IPv6\naddress space right there, it's a lot.\n\n390\n00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.970\nSo let's turn this into something\nwe can wrap our minds around.\n\n391\n00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:57.000\nI mentioned with IPv4,\nthere were 4.3 billion addresses.\n\n392\n00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.540\nAnd I mentioned that the Earth's\npopulation today is over 6 billion people.\n\n393\n00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.770\nIn the IPv6 address base, I can give 4.3\n\n394\n00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:12.230\nbillion addresses to\nevery single person on\n\n395\n00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:16.940\nthe planet and still have a ton left over.\n&gt;&gt; Woohoo!\n\n396\n00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.410\n&gt;&gt; It's massive.\n\n397\n00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.770\nThey really did say look we\ndon't want to run out again.\n\n398\n00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:26.140\nLet's plan for\nmulti planet type deployments and\n\n399\n00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.710\nwe've expanded outside of our galaxy and\nall that.\n\n400\n00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:29.860\nThey went big, right?\n\n401\n00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.080\nThis is big big big.\n\n402\n00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.560\nAnd in theory, there should be so\nmany addresses available\n\n403\n00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.760\nthat we don't need all the chits that\nwe use before, all the things like\n\n404\n00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.440\nnetwork address translation and\nproxy servers and all that stuff.\n\n405\n00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.990\nThat should go away because everybody\ncan have a true address under IPv6.\n\n406\n00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.440\nThat's the main thing that it brings.\n\n407\n00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.071\nIt brings some other features of\nfunctionality too that are nice.\n\n408\n00:21:53.071 --> 00:21:55.494\nIt's got a lot better security\nbuilt into it than IPv4 did.\n\n409\n00:21:55.494 --> 00:22:00.096\nA lot of mobility features that are built\ninto it that work really well that just\n\n410\n00:22:00.096 --> 00:22:03.660\nweren't even conceived of\nwhen IPv4 was created.\n\n411\n00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.100\nIPv6 takes that into account.\n\n412\n00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.990\nSo, definitely an exciting protocol,\n\n413\n00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:13.650\nsomething that we will want\nto migrate to when you can.\n\n414\n00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:17.580\nNow, unfortunately not\neverybody supports IPv6 yet.\n\n415\n00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.400\nAnd so as a result,\n\n416\n00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:25.190\nmost people want to support both IPv4 and\nIPv6, and you might need that as well.\n\n417\n00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.930\nSo when we go to configure the network\nin our MAC, we may need to set up both,\n\n418\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.090\nIPv4 and IPv6.\n\n419\n00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.165\nOr just IPv6 or just IPv4.\n\n420\n00:22:32.165 --> 00:22:35.269\nWe'll need to understand our network and\nwhat's configured there.\n\n421\n00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:37.747\nWe'll have to talk to our\nnetwork administrators,\n\n422\n00:22:37.747 --> 00:22:40.410\nfind out what options are available and\nget that set up.\n\n423\n00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.650\nBut that's where IPv4 and IPv6 come in.\n\n424\n00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:48.620\nI will tell you that IPv6 is not\nfully supported by everybody yet.\n\n425\n00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.520\nThere are still many many websites,\n\n426\n00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.610\nmany many services, many Internet service\nproviders that don't support IPv6 yet.\n\n427\n00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:00.110\nOver the next five to seven years\nwe'll see that adoption kick in.\n\n428\n00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:03.790\nRight now, if you want to run IPv6,\nyou can normally shop around and\n\n429\n00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.610\nfind a provider and\nget switched over to it.\n\n430\n00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.480\nI couldn't say that even three years ago,\nbut now you can.\n\n431\n00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:14.860\nSo for example, at my home,\nI have AT&amp;T gigabit fiber at home.\n\n432\n00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.640\nAnd that one, they support IPv6.\n\n433\n00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.560\nI grab an address, I can go out, I can\nbrowse end to end IPv6 on my network.\n\n434\n00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:26.130\nBut there's plenty of websites that if\nI go to them, they don't support IPv6,\n\n435\n00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.300\nI wouldn't be able to get to them.\n\n436\n00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.160\nSo I have to run both, IPV4 and IPV6.\n\n437\n00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.050\nThat'll change over the next decade,\nand we'll see everything go\n\n438\n00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.810\nstraight over to IPv6.\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, are there any network\n\n439\n00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:42.830\naddresses that we should be aware of?\n&gt;&gt; As far as ones that we configure,\n\n440\n00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:43.560\nthat's about it.\n\n441\n00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.030\nI did kinda cheat and leave one out\nearlier that I didn't mention, so\n\n442\n00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:47.700\nlet's talk about it.\n\n443\n00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.210\nI'm kind of mentioning this thing,\nthe OSI model, right?\n\n444\n00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.987\nIn other words this is different layers,\nand\n\n445\n00:23:52.987 --> 00:23:55.295\nin layer one that was the physical\nstuff like our cabling.\n\n446\n00:23:55.295 --> 00:24:01.360\nAnd at Layer two, I said that was\nwhere our media protocol lands.\n\n447\n00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.188\nSo I give Ethernet as an example, right?\n\n448\n00:24:03.188 --> 00:24:04.236\n802.11 is an example.\n\n449\n00:24:04.236 --> 00:24:08.493\nThere's actually an address\nthat's used at that space too.\n\n450\n00:24:08.493 --> 00:24:12.377\nAnd the main reason I wanna mention it\nis because that address is called a MAC\n\n451\n00:24:12.377 --> 00:24:13.710\naddress.\n&gt;&gt; It's true.\n\n452\n00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.830\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is a Mac show, so\n\n453\n00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.330\nthat makes sense, right?\n\n454\n00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.270\nWell, it's actually not\nMac as in Macintosh,\n\n455\n00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.030\nit's MAC as in media access control.\n\n456\n00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:28.650\nIn order to talk on a line, you have to\nmake sure that nobody one else is talking.\n\n457\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:32.060\nIf two people talk at the same time,\nyou have what's called a collision.\n\n458\n00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.370\nAnd if two electrical impulses hit\neach other, they just disperse and\n\n459\n00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:36.610\nyou lose your data.\n\n460\n00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:38.338\nSo there has to be a way to detect and\n\n461\n00:24:38.338 --> 00:24:41.320\nensure that you're able\nto communicate cleanly.\n\n462\n00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.360\nMedia access control does that, and\n\n463\n00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.870\nit does that by using a couple\nof different technologies.\n\n464\n00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:51.870\nWe could go into the whole,\nwas it CSMACD and then all that stuff?\n\n465\n00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:56.030\nBut at the end of the day,\nit's really just listening on the line.\n\n466\n00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:56.660\nAnd listening for\n\n467\n00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.510\ncommunications then include a MAC address,\na media access control address.\n\n468\n00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.250\nAnd MAC addresses,\nthey look really different,\n\n469\n00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.540\nthey don't look like what I'm seeing here.\n\n470\n00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.300\nIn fact, here,\nI'm gonna fire up a terminal,\n\n471\n00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.680\nI'll show you what some\nof those look like.\n\n472\n00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:17.535\nSo here's my terminal, and\nI'm just gonna do ifconfig.\n\n473\n00:25:17.535 --> 00:25:21.505\nifconfig is a terminal command that\nis the interface configuration.\n\n474\n00:25:21.505 --> 00:25:23.665\nIt's not what we're gonna use\nto configure the interfaces,\n\n475\n00:25:23.665 --> 00:25:25.475\nwe'll use the GUI for that.\n\n476\n00:25:25.475 --> 00:25:28.875\nBut it shows you a lot of really\ngood stuff about your network.\n\n477\n00:25:28.875 --> 00:25:32.355\nAnd I can come in here and I can find\nmy network interface right here.\n\n478\n00:25:32.355 --> 00:25:37.920\nThis is mine, en0, and when I look at it,\nI can see my addresses.\n\n479\n00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:43.400\nHere is an IPv4 address, see what it looks\nlike, the address that I showed earlier.\n\n480\n00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.040\nIt's four numbers separated by dots,\n\n481\n00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:50.590\nthese are the 32 bit address\nrepresented as four octets.\n\n482\n00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:57.099\nRight above it, I have an IPv6 address,\nit doesn't look like an IPv4 address.\n\n483\n00:25:57.099 --> 00:26:01.813\nSee how it's fe80, 8e6, 3972, bd9e,\n\n484\n00:26:01.813 --> 00:26:06.430\nit's got letters in it,\nwhat's that all about?\n\n485\n00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.140\nWell, it uses hexadecimal, with a,\n\n486\n00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:13.730\nI don't wanna turn this into\na mathematics lesson or whatever.\n\n487\n00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.430\nBut in our normal numbers that we do,\n\n488\n00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:20.160\nwe do base ten numbers, right,\neach digit is gonna be zero through nine.\n\n489\n00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.590\nSo if I'm counting like a computer,\n\n490\n00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.030\nI start at zero,\nI go all the way up to nine.\n\n491\n00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:27.920\nWhen I get to nine I'm ready to go to ten,\nI now split into two digits, right?\n\n492\n00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.100\nAnd when I get to 99, I'm ready to go to\n100, I split it into three digits, right?\n\n493\n00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.730\nAnd so every digit is a base ten value,\nright, so\n\n494\n00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.348\nwe're just increasing\nexponentially as we go.\n\n495\n00:26:38.348 --> 00:26:44.281\nWell, in binary,\nit's called base two mathematics,\n\n496\n00:26:44.281 --> 00:26:46.940\nyou have a zero and a one.\n\n497\n00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.460\nIf you're gonna go higher than\nthe one now you go to two digits.\n\n498\n00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.680\nAnd then if you wanna go higher than 11,\nyou go to three digits, and 111,\n\n499\n00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.680\nyou go to four digits, and so on.\n\n500\n00:26:54.680 --> 00:27:00.740\nWith hexadecimal you actually\nhave base 16 mathematics.\n\n501\n00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:05.426\nAnd that means you go from 0 to 15\nbefore you roll over to the next number.\n\n502\n00:27:05.426 --> 00:27:10.550\nWell, in our human minds,\nwe think base 10, 15 is two digits, right?\n\n503\n00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:16.390\nBut I need something where I can\nrepresent 15 values with 1 digit,\n\n504\n00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.480\nand that's what hexadecimal does.\n\n505\n00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.819\nIt does 0 through 9 and\nthen A through F, so\n\n506\n00:27:21.819 --> 00:27:26.691\nif I was counting to 16 or\n15 cuz we start at 0, we'd say 0,\n\n507\n00:27:26.691 --> 00:27:32.420\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\n8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\n508\n00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:39.750\nSo A is 10, and F is 15, and so\nthat's how we're able to measure that out.\n\n509\n00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.200\nAnd so what I'm seeing here\nis a hexadecimal address.\n\n510\n00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:49.530\nThis F would mean 15, this E would mean\n14, over here, this B would mean 11.\n\n511\n00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:54.650\nSo that's what they're representing\ninside of there in base 16 mathematics,\n\n512\n00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:55.880\nall right?\n\n513\n00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.100\nNow that's a 128 bit hexadecimal number.\n\n514\n00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:04.330\nIt's easy to mix up with this hexadecimal\nnumber right above it, all right.\n\n515\n00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:07.540\nThis is a 48 bit hexadecimal number,\nsee how it's shorter?\n\n516\n00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:13.620\nThis where on my screen it\njust says ether, that is\n\n517\n00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.560\nmy MAC address,\nmy media access control address.\n\n518\n00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.730\nEvery network adapter you have has to\nhave a media access control address.\n\n519\n00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.510\nAnd you don't set it,\nit's burned into the card at the factory.\n\n520\n00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:29.560\nWhen they manufacture that card,\nthey burn the address in there, and\n\n521\n00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.860\nit's supposed to be unique.\n\n522\n00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.320\nYou should be the only person using\nthat address on the entire planet.\n\n523\n00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.720\nDoesn't always work out that way, but\nthat's the way it's supposed to be.\n\n524\n00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.610\nAnd so if you look at each of my network\nadapters as I kinda go down my list here.\n\n525\n00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:44.470\nI'll see where each of them have\n\n526\n00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:49.410\na media access control address, and\neach one's a little bit different.\n\n527\n00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:54.470\nSome of them start with a d,\nindicating that they're virtual.\n\n528\n00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:59.220\nOther ones start with a particular number,\nwhich means it's assigned to a company.\n\n529\n00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.500\nSo there's little variations in there,\nbut that is another type of address.\n\n530\n00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.890\nOn a positive side,\nwe don't have to configure it though,\n\n531\n00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.360\nit's already burned in, but\nyour computer is using it regularly.\n\n532\n00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.420\nIf you wanna learn more about how these\nthings work, I encourage you to jump over\n\n533\n00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.490\nand check out our network plus content,\nbecause we go into the real details there.\n\n534\n00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.270\nWe hit the whole OSI model, we talk about\nexactly how the communication goes between\n\n535\n00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.828\nmachines, you can learn a ton.\n\n536\n00:29:20.828 --> 00:29:25.040\nFor the exam, they just want you\nto be familiar with these, right.\n\n537\n00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.220\nBe familiar with the media access\ncontrol address, what it is, and\n\n538\n00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.310\nthat you don't have to configure it.\n\n539\n00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.550\nBe familiar with IPv4 and IPv6 and\nwhat the difference is between the two,\n\n540\n00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.500\nwhy you pick one versus the other.\n\n541\n00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.170\nAnd then, how you can get it\nconfigured on your system so\n\n542\n00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.439\nyou can actually use it.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome job, Don,\n\n543\n00:29:39.439 --> 00:29:41.210\nnetwork configuration, guess what?\n\n544\n00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:44.760\nThis is part one, there's gonna\nbe a part two and a part three,\n\n545\n00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.010\nso make sure you see everything.\n\n546\n00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.650\nBefore we move on,\n\n547\n00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:50.040\nthough, anything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; All right, in this episode, I focused\n\n548\n00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:54.370\non the kind of fundamentals and theory,\nright, so how the network functions.\n\n549\n00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.530\nIn the next episode,\nwe're gonna actually configure, right,\n\n550\n00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.340\nso we're gonna go into\nour network settings.\n\n551\n00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.050\nWe're going to start looking at some of\nthe options and see what we can tweak and\n\n552\n00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:03.000\nchange and modifying the system.\n\n553\n00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:08.130\nSorry to have been maybe a little boring,\nlecturey, whatever this time around.\n\n554\n00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.180\nBut it had to be done,\nbecause it's on the exam.\n\n555\n00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.760\nIn the next episode, though,\nwe will be actually jumping in and\n\n556\n00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.060\nstarting to configure.\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n557\n00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.600\nmore network configuration coming\nyour way, and I can't wait.\n\n558\n00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.190\nAnd by the way, Apple certified support\nprofessional is a wonderful series.\n\n559\n00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.380\nDon's worked very hard to\nbring this together for\n\n560\n00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.310\nyou, it will help you in the long run.\n\n561\n00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:27.460\nAnd you'll be in the course library,\nthere's thousands of other videos there.\n\n562\n00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.772\nAnd they're all designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further, so\n\n563\n00:30:30.772 --> 00:30:31.850\ncheck those out too.\n\n564\n00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:36.050\nAnd tell everybody that you know about\nITProTV; ITProTV is bingeworthy.\n\n565\n00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.510\nThanks for watching, I'm Zack Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n566\n00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.672\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again very soon.\n\n567\n00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:47.049\n[MUSIC]\n\n568\n00:30:47.049 --> 00:30:50.370\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:12.830\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.590\nwatching ITProTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n5\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.240\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with\n\n6\n00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.860\nApple Certified Support Professional,\nNetwork Configuration Part 2.\n\n7\n00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.230\nAnd of course Don Pezet\nis here to help us out.\n\n8\n00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.535\nDon, great to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Great to be back Zach.\n\n9\n00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:31.780\nAnd continuing on with our\nnetwork configuration adventure,\n\n10\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.505\nin our first part, we talked mostly\njust about how networks function.\n\n11\n00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:38.965\nAnd in this episode we're gonna take\nthat and apply it to our Mac, and\n\n12\n00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:41.955\nsee how we can get our Mac\nto function on the network.\n\n13\n00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:44.145\nSo we'll run through some of\nthe different requirements,\n\n14\n00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:45.695\nhow we get these things configured and\nset up.\n\n15\n00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:49.630\nAnd how each little piece plays it's part\n\n16\n00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.440\nin allowing a Mac to talk on the network.\n&gt;&gt; So what does our Mac need to\n\n17\n00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.020\ncommunicate on the network?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n18\n00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.540\nthe main thing it needs is an address,\nit needs an address.\n\n19\n00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.090\nIf I want two computers to be able to\ntalk to each other, they need an address.\n\n20\n00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.680\nNow, there's some other information\nthat's nice to have also.\n\n21\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.650\nFor example,\n\n22\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.870\nif I need to get out to the Internet,\nI'm gonna need a router to talk to.\n\n23\n00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.137\nAnd so, typically when we're configuring\na new Mac, figuring out an address, and\n\n24\n00:01:13.137 --> 00:01:16.540\nfiguring out a router or\nsometimes it's called a gateway.\n\n25\n00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.690\nThose two things are the key pieces we\nneed to get out the system up and going.\n\n26\n00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.945\nNow, fortunately, a lot of this\nstuff isn't hard for us to do.\n\n27\n00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:26.630\nAnd Apple tries to make this\nstuff as automatic as possible.\n\n28\n00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.502\nSo, for example, when you install macOS,\nassuming you leave it at all the defaults,\n\n29\n00:01:31.502 --> 00:01:34.020\nyou don't change any settings.\n\n30\n00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.585\nWell, it will try to automatically\nget an IPv4 address, or\n\n31\n00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:43.870\nit'll automatically get an IPv6 address,\nor actually, by default, it will do both.\n\n32\n00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.400\nWith IPv4, there's a protocol called DHCP,\nor dynamic host configuration protocol.\n\n33\n00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.190\nAnd what DHCP does, is it allows your\nMac to come on to the network and\n\n34\n00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.500\nto send out this great big message,\nlike shouting.\n\n35\n00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.670\nAnd say, hey, I need an address,\ncan somebody help me?\n\n36\n00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.920\nAnd a server out there will hear that and\nrespond back, and say, yeah,\n\n37\n00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.930\nI can help you, here's an address,\ngood luck, right?\n\n38\n00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.900\nSo that's automatic.\n\n39\n00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.730\nYou can also do it manually, though,\nand if you do it manually that's what's\n\n40\n00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.560\ncalled a static IP, you've statically\nassigned an address to the system.\n\n41\n00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.130\nAnd so we need to do that by hand,\n\n42\n00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.140\nif you need a static IP,\nyou are going to have to do it.\n\n43\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.750\nApple doesn't know what\nstatic you should have.\n\n44\n00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.740\nIf it's automatic, though,\nthat's already set up.\n\n45\n00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.490\nAnd IPv6 is the same way, there is DHCP\nfor IPv6, but most people don't use it.\n\n46\n00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.300\nIPv6 has largely moved over to what's\ncalled stateless autoconfiguration.\n\n47\n00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.550\nAnd so it will automatically\nconfigure itself and get it going.\n\n48\n00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.360\nBut you might have a static IPv6 address,\nand if that's the case, again,\n\n49\n00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.700\nyou ask your network administrator,\nhey, I need my address.\n\n50\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.205\nAnd then they tell you what it is,\nyou come and plug it in, and\n\n51\n00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:46.690\nnow you're ready to communicate.\n\n52\n00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.110\nSo, it can be automatic,\nor it can be manual.\n\n53\n00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.585\nIf it's manual,\nwe're gotta get that information and\n\n54\n00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:55.970\nthen we've gotta plug it in to our system.\n&gt;&gt; Well, once we have an address,\n\n55\n00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.620\nhow does our system use it?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if it's automatic,\n\n56\n00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.100\nwe just get the address or manually put\nit in, now the system is ready to use it.\n\n57\n00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.740\nAnd the address is made up of parts.\n\n58\n00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.800\nYou might remember from part one where\nI drew an address on the screen and\n\n59\n00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.620\nit had little dots on it or colons to\nseparate out the different numbers.\n\n60\n00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.530\nThose parts are able to be used by\nthe system to figure out whether somebody\n\n61\n00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.578\nis on my network or on a different network\nand then communications are based on that.\n\n62\n00:03:24.578 --> 00:03:28.700\nIf I'm gonna see this, we're gonna use\na utility here called the Network Utility.\n\n63\n00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.320\nThe Network Utility, if you browse into\nyour system, go into Applications.\n\n64\n00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.290\nInside of your Applications folder,\nthere's another folder called Utilities.\n\n65\n00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.400\nAnd inside Utilities, you will find\nthe Network Utility somewhere in here.\n\n66\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.670\nSorry, I don't normally go this way, I\nusually just use the Spotlight to find it.\n\n67\n00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.710\nActually you know what, shoot,\nI forgot this is High Sierra.\n\n68\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.370\nBack in regular Sierra, they moved the\nstinking Network Utility, so it's actually\n\n69\n00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.380\nmoved and tucked away inside of the core\nservices folder in the system folder.\n\n70\n00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.350\nSo it's actually hidden here in the UI.\n\n71\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.000\nSo, I will have to use\nthe Spotlight after all.\n\n72\n00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.850\nI was trying to show you\nguys the manual way, but\n\n73\n00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.620\nif you do it through Spotlight,\nyou can just type network and\n\n74\n00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.850\nNetwork Utility is usually\nthe first thing that comes up.\n\n75\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.020\nIf you ever wanna browse and find it,\nit's inside slash Systems slash\n\n76\n00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.126\nCore Services and tucked away in there\nyou'll find the Network Utility.\n\n77\n00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:27.710\nBut if you fire it up, it shows you\ninformation about your network, and\n\n78\n00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.300\nit shows if you've got an address.\n\n79\n00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.232\nSo I can see my laptop's address is\n10.0.222.222, that's my address,\n\n80\n00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:35.628\nall right?\n\n81\n00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.920\nPart of that address is my network and\n\n82\n00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.146\nthe other part of the address is my host,\nmy individual machine.\n\n83\n00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:46.780\nAnd so when I go to talk to\nsomebody else on the network,\n\n84\n00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.780\nI can compare my address to their address.\n\n85\n00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.990\nAnd we compare them, I can find out,\nare they on the same network as me?\n\n86\n00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.420\nBecause if they are,\nI can just talk direct.\n\n87\n00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.230\nBut if they're on different networks,\nwell,\n\n88\n00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.350\nthen I'm gonna need to go through a router\nto be able to get to that other network.\n\n89\n00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.870\nAnd that's how we know to\ngo through the router.\n\n90\n00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.240\nNow, we don't see a lot\nof that right here.\n\n91\n00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.700\nOkay, but, you can see it a little\nbetter with this Traceroute utility.\n\n92\n00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.710\nSo, for example,\nif I switch over to Traceroute tab.\n\n93\n00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.957\nLet's say that I wanna talk to another\nperson right here on my network.\n\n94\n00:05:20.957 --> 00:05:25.111\nI wanna talk to one of\nour storage appliances.\n\n95\n00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:28.570\nSo there's 10.0.10.7, all right?\n\n96\n00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.462\nMy laptop is 10.0.222.222, and\n\n97\n00:05:32.462 --> 00:05:37.000\nthe network ID for\nmy laptop is the first two, the 10.0.\n\n98\n00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.380\nThis one starts with 10.0 also,\nit's on the same network as me.\n\n99\n00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.845\nSo if I punch that in and\nthen click the Trace button,\n\n100\n00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:50.950\nit will reach us out and I can get right\nto that person, I can talk directly.\n\n101\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.460\nAnd it knew to do that because we're\nright here on the same network,\n\n102\n00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.810\nyou just figure it out,\njump right over there.\n\n103\n00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.620\nAnd it's able to communicate,\nit's a distance of one hop, one hop away.\n\n104\n00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.430\nOkay, now when I did this,\nI did it using an IP address.\n\n105\n00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.167\nThere's usually an extra step in here\ncuz we don't normally type IP addresses.\n\n106\n00:06:12.167 --> 00:06:16.038\nIf is say, hey,\nI want you to go to Apple's web page,\n\n107\n00:06:16.038 --> 00:06:17.945\nwhat pops into your mind?\n\n108\n00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:20.460\nWell, you think www.apple.com, right?\n\n109\n00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.510\nThat's what pops into my mind,\nI don't think about an actual IP address.\n\n110\n00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.097\nIf you go to the Lookup tab and you\ntype in something like www.apple.com and\n\n111\n00:06:30.097 --> 00:06:34.492\nhit up Lookup, you will find, well,\nthey've got an address, right?\n\n112\n00:06:34.492 --> 00:06:37.560\nSo, Apple.com's address right now,\n\n113\n00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.940\nactually they have multiple addresses and\nthey do load balancing and stuff, so\n\n114\n00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.470\nif you do this at home you might\nget a different address than I do.\n\n115\n00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.670\nBut I get 23.73.145.203, right?\n\n116\n00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.250\nSo, if Apple is releasing\na new iPhone tomorrow and\n\n117\n00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.480\nI want to go and pre-order it, I don't\nsay, hm, let me fire up a web browser and\n\n118\n00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.930\ntype in 23.73.145.203,\nnot gonna happen, right?\n\n119\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.570\nAnd I can't remember that,\nI can barely remember my own phone number.\n\n120\n00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.960\nSo, we're gonna remember names,\nwe're gonna use names for this stuff.\n\n121\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.790\nAnd so there is usually\na first step that happens.\n\n122\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.650\nI wanna talk to another computer.\n\n123\n00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.070\nI know it's name,\nI need to find the address.\n\n124\n00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.648\nSo, I talk to a DNS server,\na DNS server is a name lookup server and\n\n125\n00:07:16.648 --> 00:07:19.220\nit converts a name to an IP.\n\n126\n00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.780\nSo, when I communicate out,\nit finds out what that address is.\n\n127\n00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.230\nAnd once it knows the address, then we're\nable to reach out and talk to it and\n\n128\n00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.680\nthat's what I was seeing\nhere with Traceroute.\n\n129\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.541\nSo let's see it all kind of roll together.\n\n130\n00:07:31.541 --> 00:07:36.301\nI'm gonna say, let me pick a server that's\nright here in the building with me, and\n\n131\n00:07:36.301 --> 00:07:37.662\nall trace that one out.\n\n132\n00:07:37.662 --> 00:07:42.586\nAnd so what happened here is I\ntyped in a name dp.itpro.tv,\n\n133\n00:07:42.586 --> 00:07:48.673\nit did a lookup and\nit found the IP address was 10.0.222.227,\n\n134\n00:07:48.673 --> 00:07:51.487\nthat's on the same network as me.\n\n135\n00:07:51.487 --> 00:07:55.850\nAnd then I was able to talk to it,\none hop away, direct communication.\n\n136\n00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.604\nAnd now I'm talking and functioning, and\n\n137\n00:07:58.604 --> 00:08:01.829\nall I needed was a DNS server\nto do the name lookup.\n\n138\n00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:05.183\nAnd then the IP address of that other\nsystem, and now they'll be able to get\n\n139\n00:08:05.183 --> 00:08:08.707\nright in and start to communicate.\n&gt;&gt; How does a remote communication differ,\n\n140\n00:08:08.707 --> 00:08:09.459\nDon?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n141\n00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:12.390\nthere's gonna be a lot more involved\nwith the remote communication.\n\n142\n00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.620\nBecause here, the computer's right\non the same network as me, but\n\n143\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.370\nif it's on a different network,\nI'm gonna have to go out on the Internet.\n\n144\n00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.400\nI'm gonna have to cross the Internet\nto get to wherever I'm going.\n\n145\n00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.850\nSo for example,\nlet me go back to my Lookup tab.\n\n146\n00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:30.654\nAnd I'll take a website\nlike showmemy.info, right?\n\n147\n00:08:30.654 --> 00:08:35.161\nThat's a little web page we have that,\nwell, shows you your information.\n\n148\n00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:35.932\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n149\n00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.309\n&gt;&gt; It shows you your IP address.\n\n150\n00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:42.430\nSo that runs on a little server\nin Amazon Web Services, in AWS.\n\n151\n00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.380\nSo that's out there on the Internet.\n\n152\n00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.400\nWhen I do a lookup, see that address?\n\n153\n00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.403\nIt doesn't start with 10.0.\nIf it started with 10.0,\n\n154\n00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:52.270\nthat would mean it's here on my network.\n\n155\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.672\nBut it doesn't start with 10.0.\n\n156\n00:08:53.672 --> 00:08:54.721\nIt starts with 52.87.\n\n157\n00:08:54.721 --> 00:08:57.890\nThat's a different network.\n\n158\n00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:03.640\nSo my Mac is gonna say, all right, well, I\nknow the IP, and that's not on my network.\n\n159\n00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.025\nI don't know how to get there.\n\n160\n00:09:06.025 --> 00:09:07.690\nI'm gonna need some help.\n\n161\n00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:08.890\nAnd so it's gonna reach out for\n\n162\n00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.800\na gateway to help it, right,\na router somewhere on the network.\n\n163\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.610\nNow here in our studios, our router\nis actually our firewall as well,\n\n164\n00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.300\nit's combined.\n\n165\n00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.140\nSo it might not be a dedicated router,\nyou might have a router, firewall or\n\n166\n00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.860\na wireless router, like most people have\nat home these days, that kinda thing,\n\n167\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.690\nit just depends.\n\n168\n00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.183\nBut firewalls are just very secure\nrouters, is really all they are.\n\n169\n00:09:29.183 --> 00:09:32.700\n[COUGH] So\nthat's what my system's gonna use.\n\n170\n00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.210\nIf I go to do that trace route again and\nI type in showmemy.info and\n\n171\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.146\nI run a trace, okay, here it goes,\nrunning a trace, and\n\n172\n00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:44.764\nlook at all that information\nthat's scrolling by.\n\n173\n00:09:44.764 --> 00:09:47.490\nHm, okay, what is all of that?\n\n174\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.696\nWell, you know what,\nactually I'm gonna have to stop it here.\n\n175\n00:09:49.696 --> 00:09:54.201\nI'm gonna stop it because I forgot that\nserver has a firewall on it, and so it's\n\n176\n00:09:54.201 --> 00:09:59.410\nblocking the communication to the final\nstep, but we can see the other steps.\n\n177\n00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.225\nMy system said I need to get to\n52.87.109.124, I need to get to that host,\n\n178\n00:10:04.225 --> 00:10:06.123\nbut I don't know how to get there.\n\n179\n00:10:06.123 --> 00:10:08.470\nSo let's go through the firewall.\n\n180\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:13.113\nSo it reached out to our firewall, right\nhere, this one, 209.251.131.97, all right?\n\n181\n00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:17.890\nI'm guessing that's the public\nIP of our firewall.\n\n182\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.550\nSo it jumped over that public IP, and then\nit jumped out onto our carrier network.\n\n183\n00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.790\nOur carrier network,\n\n184\n00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.710\nwe use a company called GRU,\nGainesville Regional Utilities.\n\n185\n00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.020\nThey provide our Internet access,\nand so I'm now on the GRU network.\n\n186\n00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:36.040\nAnd then from GRU,\nthey send me over to ntt,\n\n187\n00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.388\nwhich is one of the national telecoms,\none of the Internet backbones.\n\n188\n00:10:39.388 --> 00:10:44.221\nAnd so I'm on the Internet backbone, and\nif you look at some of the cities here,\n\n189\n00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:46.241\nyou can start to spot city names,\n\n190\n00:10:46.241 --> 00:10:49.438\nlike this one where it's\nAtlanta in north Georgia.\n\n191\n00:10:49.438 --> 00:10:53.140\nSo, you've got Atlanta,\nthen we've got Dallas, Texas.\n\n192\n00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.410\nSo, I jumped all the way over to Texas,\n\n193\n00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.015\nsometimes the names are there,\nthey help you.\n\n194\n00:10:56.015 --> 00:10:59.071\nSo anyway, I jumped over to Texas,\nand then from there,\n\n195\n00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:03.035\nI dropped onto some systems that\ndon't have published names, just IPs.\n\n196\n00:11:03.035 --> 00:11:05.976\nAnd this is gonna be in\nAmazon's data center, so\n\n197\n00:11:05.976 --> 00:11:10.180\nI'll probably hit a load bounce or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n198\n00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.250\nAnd from there, well, then it went dark.\n\n199\n00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.200\nSee that little *, I hit a firewall.\n\n200\n00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.072\nOnce you hit a firewall, you might not\nbe able to peruse in any further, and\n\n201\n00:11:19.072 --> 00:11:21.052\nso you kind of lose that information.\n\n202\n00:11:21.052 --> 00:11:24.200\nAnd you can't see what's going on.\n\n203\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.540\nMaybe if I did, we will try Apple.\n\n204\n00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.740\nLet's see with Apple.\n\n205\n00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.388\nApple probably has theirs protected.\n\n206\n00:11:31.388 --> 00:11:34.915\nNo, wow, look how short that trip was.\n\n207\n00:11:34.915 --> 00:11:39.331\n[LAUGH] Occasionally you luck out and your\nservice provider is, they call it paired\n\n208\n00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:43.497\nwith a remote location, and so you get\nit there in a very short amount of hops.\n\n209\n00:11:43.497 --> 00:11:46.047\nWith my connection to Apple,\nthat absolutely happened.\n\n210\n00:11:46.047 --> 00:11:49.630\nI went to gru, our service provider.\n\n211\n00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:54.140\nThey threw me immediately onto\nAkamai's network in Atlanta, and\n\n212\n00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.460\nit looks like Apple has a copy\nof their webpage stored there.\n\n213\n00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.940\nApple has copies of their webpage\nstored all over the planet, right?\n\n214\n00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.544\nSo they had a copy stored\nright there in Atlanta.\n\n215\n00:12:01.544 --> 00:12:04.157\nI was able to get their\nwebpage in only 4 hops,\n\n216\n00:12:04.157 --> 00:12:07.790\nit was over 12 hops to get to\nthe showmemy.info page, right?\n\n217\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.280\nAll of this is being\nhandled by the routers.\n\n218\n00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.580\nAll your computer has to know is\nwho the next router in line is.\n\n219\n00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.420\nSo, my next router is the firewall\nin the closet over there.\n\n220\n00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:23.410\nAnd then it says, my next router is GRU,\nand GRU says, our next router is Akamai,\n\n221\n00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.060\nand Akamai says, and\nit just goes down the line like that.\n\n222\n00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.740\nSo, you're only responsible for\nthat one little hop.\n\n223\n00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.930\nAnd then you leave it up to\nwhoever else is out there.\n\n224\n00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.232\nThat process is going on all the time\nwhenever you talk to a remote host,\n\n225\n00:12:36.232 --> 00:12:39.029\nso a little more complex\nthan just dealing with\n\n226\n00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:40.026\na local host.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n227\n00:12:40.026 --> 00:12:42.570\nDNS is pretty important in this process,\nright?\n\n228\n00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:43.909\nSo how does it work?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n229\n00:12:43.909 --> 00:12:47.035\nbasically there's these servers that\nare out there on the Internet, or\n\n230\n00:12:47.035 --> 00:12:48.070\nyou can build your own.\n\n231\n00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.990\nYou can build your own DNS server,\nit's really easy.\n\n232\n00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:55.490\nIn fact, if you have the Mac Server App\ninstalled, it's $20 in the app store,\n\n233\n00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.430\nit's the official Apple server product,\nit has a DNS server built into it.\n\n234\n00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.280\nSo it's super easy to stand one up.\n\n235\n00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.170\nAnd it just contains lists,\nlists of names and\n\n236\n00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.380\nthe IP addresses that go along with them.\n\n237\n00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.946\nSo, when I'm here in the Network Utility,\nand I go over to my Lookup tab,\n\n238\n00:13:11.946 --> 00:13:14.300\nI'm just typing in a name.\n\n239\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.580\nSo, I'll type in www.amazon.com,\nand I'll do a Lookup.\n\n240\n00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.130\nAnd there we go,\nthere's Amazon's IP, right?\n\n241\n00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.932\nIn the background,\nit actually sent a message to a server,\n\n242\n00:13:24.932 --> 00:13:26.901\nand the server responded with an answer.\n\n243\n00:13:26.901 --> 00:13:29.770\nYou don't really see that\nin the Network Utility.\n\n244\n00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.789\nIf you go to your Terminal,\nlet's get into my Terminal,\n\n245\n00:13:33.789 --> 00:13:36.984\nwhich is apparently not gonna come up for\nme.\n\n246\n00:13:36.984 --> 00:13:39.340\nThere we go, let me get into my Terminal.\n\n247\n00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.170\nAnd I'll use a utility called dig.\n\n248\n00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:46.620\nDig is another name lookup utility\nthat gives you a lot more information.\n\n249\n00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.140\nAnd so\nI can say I wanna dig www.apple.com, and\n\n250\n00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.360\nnow I'll actually be able to see\nthe full communication, right?\n\n251\n00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.240\nI've built a question, here's my question.\n\n252\n00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.730\nMy question was, what is the A record or\nhost record for www.apple.com?\n\n253\n00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.480\nAnd I send it to a server.\n\n254\n00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.185\nAnd the server sent me a response,\n\n255\n00:14:09.185 --> 00:14:13.520\nthe server is right here, 10.0.0.1, that's\nour DNS server here in the building.\n\n256\n00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.566\nAnd it sent me an answer,\nhere's the answer.\n\n257\n00:14:15.566 --> 00:14:19.230\nWell, www.apple.com is a canonical name.\n\n258\n00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.937\nIt's actually pointing to\nwww.apple.com.edgekey.net,\n\n259\n00:14:22.937 --> 00:14:26.100\nwhich is probably\na content delivery network.\n\n260\n00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.750\nSo then it had to resolve that.\n\n261\n00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.451\nAnd so right after that,\nyou'll see where it resolves,\n\n262\n00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:35.231\nall right,\nwww.apple.com.edgekey.net is, well,\n\n263\n00:14:35.231 --> 00:14:36.864\nit's a canonical name-\n\n264\n00:14:36.864 --> 00:14:38.074\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Of\n\n265\n00:14:38.074 --> 00:14:45.532\napple.com.edgekey.net.globalredir.akadns.-\nnet, that's Akamai, Akamai's DNS.\n\n266\n00:14:45.532 --> 00:14:48.965\nAnd so now it's gotta resolve that, and\nit resolves it and this whole process goes\n\n267\n00:14:48.965 --> 00:14:52.010\non over and over and over again\nuntil it finally gets to the center.\n\n268\n00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.552\nI see that whole communication though.\n\n269\n00:14:53.552 --> 00:14:57.420\nThe dig utility is really handy\nwhen you're troubleshooting things.\n\n270\n00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:04.768\nBecause you do see that www.apple.com\ndidn't point to 23.73.145.203.\n\n271\n00:15:04.768 --> 00:15:09.594\nInstead, there were four\ndifferent cnames involved before I\n\n272\n00:15:09.594 --> 00:15:13.332\nfinally got to the actual\nvalue that had the IP.\n\n273\n00:15:13.332 --> 00:15:18.394\nAll of that's going on in the background,\nand when we set up our network interfaces,\n\n274\n00:15:18.394 --> 00:15:21.138\nit's important that we\nprovide that value and\n\n275\n00:15:21.138 --> 00:15:23.624\nactually get the right DNS server set up.\n\n276\n00:15:23.624 --> 00:15:25.891\nOr we're not gonna be able\nto do those lookups, and\n\n277\n00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:27.760\nthat can cause a lot of problems.\n\n278\n00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.310\nAnd there's a lot of DNS servers that\nare out there, you can build your own.\n\n279\n00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.098\nOr your Internet service provider probably\noffers you DNS servers as part of your\n\n280\n00:15:35.098 --> 00:15:35.608\nservice.\n\n281\n00:15:35.608 --> 00:15:39.160\nThey almost all do, or\nyou can use public DNS servers.\n\n282\n00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.649\nThere's plenty of them that are out there.\n\n283\n00:15:40.649 --> 00:15:43.165\nLet me use another\nutility called nslookup.\n\n284\n00:15:44.605 --> 00:15:46.181\nnslookup lets me run, well,\n\n285\n00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:49.910\nname lookups, but you can specify\nwhat server you wanna run against.\n\n286\n00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.025\nFor example,\nGoogle has 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4,\n\n287\n00:15:54.025 --> 00:15:57.085\nthose are two published\nDNS servers they have.\n\n288\n00:15:57.085 --> 00:16:01.029\nAnd so I can do lookups against their\nserver and get answers back, and\n\n289\n00:16:01.029 --> 00:16:03.070\nI can see what's going on, right?\n\n290\n00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:08.239\nI can switch Level three\ncommunications as 4.2.2.1 and\n\n291\n00:16:08.239 --> 00:16:11.465\n4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.3.\n\n292\n00:16:11.465 --> 00:16:14.873\nAnd so I can do lookups against then and\nusually reach out and\n\n293\n00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:17.200\nget the same information.\n\n294\n00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.080\nNow notice when I did the lookup\nthrough Google I got one IP.\n\n295\n00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.380\nAnd when I did the lookup through\nlevel three, I got a different IP.\n\n296\n00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.660\nWhy is that?\n\n297\n00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.030\nApple actually has hundreds of servers.\n\n298\n00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.870\nSo, it load balances, people get\nspread across the different servers.\n\n299\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.020\nThat's the way their site can stay up even\nwhen they are running a big sale, right?\n\n300\n00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.280\nThat's a big deal.\n\n301\n00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:42.040\nSo, you'll get that but either\nservice here is providing their valid\n\n302\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.720\naddress to be able to reach out and\npull up Apple's webpage.\n\n303\n00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.790\nI know a lot of this is automatic, but\nis it difficult to configure manually?\n\n304\n00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.720\nNo!\nIt is pretty easy.\n\n305\n00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.420\nWell, it can get a little confusing\nif you have more than one adapter.\n\n306\n00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.470\nFor example, my Mac.\n\n307\n00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:57.380\nWhen I first bought it,\n\n308\n00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.210\nwhen I first got it on day one,\nall it had was a wifi adapter.\n\n309\n00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.960\nSo all you have to do for\nwifi is you get in there and connect.\n\n310\n00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.450\nAnd we will actually cover wifi\na little bit later on, but that was it.\n\n311\n00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.660\nBecause I do a lot of network work.\n\n312\n00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.250\nAnd organize space and\nI'm an IT guy and I wanna.\n\n313\n00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.390\nNow my system's gotten far more complex.\n\n314\n00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.560\nI have a lot more adapters than I used to.\n\n315\n00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.760\nSo it can become complex but\nit doesn't necessarily have to be.\n\n316\n00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.100\nSo let me show you what I mean.\n\n317\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:30.180\nBack here in my desktop,\nI'm going to my system preferences.\n\n318\n00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.860\nAnd in system preferences you've\ngot the network system preference.\n\n319\n00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.150\n&gt;&gt; That make sense.\n\n320\n00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.540\n&gt;&gt; And when you go in there.\n\n321\n00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.290\nIf you have a macbook air, or\n\n322\n00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:44.570\nany the macbooks,\nyou probably see two things in there.\n\n323\n00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.940\nYou will likely just see why Wifi And\nBluetooth.\n\n324\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.970\nAnd that's probably it, okay.\n\n325\n00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.450\nYou might see a Thunderbolt Bridge\ndepending which system you got.\n\n326\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.320\nAnd Thunderbolt Bridge is\na little bit too long.\n\n327\n00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.490\nSo it starts to abbreviate that's\nwhy it got the ellipses right\n\n328\n00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:01.310\nthere in the middle.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-mh.\n\n329\n00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.480\n&gt;&gt; But that's probably all you'll\n\n330\n00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.920\nsee, okay.\n\n331\n00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.630\nNow on mine I have installed some\nthird party software that created\n\n332\n00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:08.400\na virtual adpater.\n\n333\n00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:14.080\nThat's what this AJA Mi configure\nmini converter or whatever is.\n\n334\n00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.690\nSo those are from some\nother software that I have.\n\n335\n00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:21.020\nAnd then I have this USB gigabyte adapter.\n\n336\n00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.620\nWhen I am back at my desk,\n\n337\n00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:27.450\nI like to be plugged in with a physical\ncable cuz you get reliable, fast access.\n\n338\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.540\nSo I have a USB network adapter,\nbut when I am at my desk.\n\n339\n00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.020\nI pug in to my little dock and\nthat adapter shows up.\n\n340\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.520\nThe adapter is not present right now.\n\n341\n00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.450\nBut it still shows up here because\nthe system has seen it before.\n\n342\n00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.950\nAnd that happens as you add more and\nmore devices.\n\n343\n00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:47.010\nSo, for example, sometimes we\ndo like wireless security scans.\n\n344\n00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.630\nAnd so I have a special\nwireless adapter for that,\n\n345\n00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.320\nthis crazy looking thing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n346\n00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.270\n&gt;&gt; But the green part here is the actual\n\n347\n00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.473\nwireless adapter.\n&gt;&gt; It looks like an advanced fly swatter.\n\n348\n00:18:57.473 --> 00:18:59.065\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know, it does.\n\n349\n00:18:59.065 --> 00:19:03.730\nThis little thing here is called a waffle\nantenna and it's really, really powerful.\n\n350\n00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:06.880\nSo when I want to do a scan and\nmeasure wireless strength.\n\n351\n00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.270\nAnd look for road access points,\nsecurity, stuff like that.\n\n352\n00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.420\nThis thing works great, so I usually\ncarry a couple of these for that purpose.\n\n353\n00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.370\nSo this is a wireless adapter\nthat is different than\n\n354\n00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.410\nthe wireless adapter\nthat's built into the Mac.\n\n355\n00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:23.400\nSo if I install drivers if I\nneed it I can plug this in.\n\n356\n00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.005\nAnd it'll show up and\nit'll be one more entry in my a list.\n\n357\n00:19:26.005 --> 00:19:27.535\nSo for example, if I just plug it in.\n\n358\n00:19:29.445 --> 00:19:31.355\nStick that one on here.\n\n359\n00:19:31.355 --> 00:19:32.135\nThere we go.\n\n360\n00:19:32.135 --> 00:19:35.495\nSo, it's going to identify that adapter.\n\n361\n00:19:35.495 --> 00:19:38.627\nIt is going to figure out whether or\nnot it can support it natively.\n\n362\n00:19:38.627 --> 00:19:40.607\nAnd if it does,\n\n363\n00:19:40.607 --> 00:19:43.907\nif it supports it natively,\nyou'll see it appear here, right.\n\n364\n00:19:43.907 --> 00:19:47.367\nIf it doesn't support it natively then\nyou might need to install drivers.\n\n365\n00:19:47.367 --> 00:19:50.067\nSo you may actually need to get back out,\ngo back in.\n\n366\n00:19:50.067 --> 00:19:54.997\nLet it refresh and you know we might\nnot have native support on this one.\n\n367\n00:19:54.997 --> 00:19:57.087\nSo I might need to load the driver,\nthought I'd already loaded it but\n\n368\n00:19:57.087 --> 00:19:58.190\napparently not.\n\n369\n00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:02.900\nSo you may see more adaptors start\nto show up there based on whether or\n\n370\n00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.620\nnot you need the driver.\n\n371\n00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.560\nIf you like me and\nI've been apparently reset this laptop.\n\n372\n00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.260\nSince I use my adaptor last I\ndon't have the driver installed.\n\n373\n00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.400\nSometimes it's just a matter of going into\nthe app store and looking for updates.\n\n374\n00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.380\nAnd you'll find the driver there other\ntimes you might have to reboot if it's\n\n375\n00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.390\na current extension\nthat's got to be loaded.\n\n376\n00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.230\nOr in my case, I probably need to go and\n\n377\n00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.800\ndownload the driver from\nthe vendor website.\n\n378\n00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.950\nBut there's also virtual adapters\nthat can turn up in here, too.\n\n379\n00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.500\nSo down at the bottom, see how I've\ngot the little plus and minus?\n\n380\n00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.950\nI can hit that plus to add\nin other network adapters.\n\n381\n00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:40.870\nAnd you'll see, Thunderbolt Bridge,\nBluetooth PAN, Wi-Fi,\n\n382\n00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.860\nVPNs, Point-to-Point\nprotocol over Ethernet.\n\n383\n00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.980\n6to4, which is IPv6 to IPv4 tunnels.\n\n384\n00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:51.490\nThese are all other types of network\ninterfaces that I might choose to add in\n\n385\n00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.170\nto then have access to.\n\n386\n00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.440\nSo, for example, if I come in and add in\nsome additional Wi-Fi service, or a VPN.\n\n387\n00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.140\nI'm going to have additional\ndata that I've got to provide.\n\n388\n00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.190\nIn order to get connected to those.\n\n389\n00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.590\nThose stats get pretty complex, right?\n\n390\n00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.760\nBut as far as your normal wired and\n\n391\n00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.560\nwireless networks it is\nfairly straight forward.\n\n392\n00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.670\nIf you look at my wired network here,\nso here we are set to use DHCP,\n\n393\n00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.650\nit is gonna try to automatically get an.\n\n394\n00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.610\nSo when I am at my desk it does all\nthe math and gets it works great.\n\n395\n00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:25.470\nAnd I can drop that down and\nI can set it to manual.\n\n396\n00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.530\nAnd when I go manual,\nnow I can provide the address.\n\n397\n00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.570\nAnd I can tell it hey,\nmy address is 192.168.0.2 and\n\n398\n00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:35.520\nI'll have to provide a subnet mask.\n\n399\n00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:40.960\nThe subnet mask is how it knows what's\nthe network ID and what's the host ID.\n\n400\n00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:46.620\nRemember, earlier, my address, I said it\nwas actually 10.0.222.222, like that?\n\n401\n00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.590\nAnd then I said 10.0 was my network ID.\n\n402\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:52.030\nWell, the subnet mask\nis how we tell it that.\n\n403\n00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.700\nA subnet mask looks like an IP.\n\n404\n00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.630\nWell, actually,\nit has a ton of values, but\n\n405\n00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:00.340\nwe're normally gonna see just two things,\neither 255 or zero.\n\n406\n00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:05.220\nSo, if I have 255.255.0.0,\nthat means the first\n\n407\n00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:10.130\ntwo numbers are my network ID, and\nthe next two numbers are my host ID.\n\n408\n00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:14.970\nIf I had something like 192.168.0.2,\n\n409\n00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.646\nthen my Subnet Mask would\nnormally be something like this.\n\n410\n00:22:17.646 --> 00:22:20.890\n255.255.255.0 which\nmeans 192.168.0 are part\n\n411\n00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:26.430\nof my network are part of my\nnetwork ID and 2 is my host ID.\n\n412\n00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:29.170\nNow technically that's\nthe minimum that I need but\n\n413\n00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.680\nI'm normally going to need a router.\n\n414\n00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.500\nWho am I going to talk to,\nto be able to get out to the internet or\n\n415\n00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.710\nto other networks?\n\n416\n00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.210\nSo I'll put in the IP\naddress of the router.\n\n417\n00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.920\nThose are the primary\nsettings that we need, but\n\n418\n00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:45.190\nnotice how there's DNS Server right here,\nand the DNS Server is currently blank.\n\n419\n00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.720\nI need a DNS Server to talk to, so\n\n420\n00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.280\nI'm gonna hit that apply button to\nmake sure these changes take effect.\n\n421\n00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.860\nAnd then I'm gonna go into advanced and\nunder advance now we got a DNS tab.\n\n422\n00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.490\nAnd here's where I can add those\nDNS servers, so I can add in,\n\n423\n00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.690\nsay I want to use Google's 8.8.8.8.\n\n424\n00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.660\nor whoever it is I want to use,\nyou can add more than one.\n\n425\n00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.560\nIt will only use the first one the list\nunless the first one goes down, and\n\n426\n00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.140\nthen it will move to the second one.\n\n427\n00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.260\nSo you just need to add at least one.\n\n428\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.830\nAnd once that's in place now I've got\nenough information to be able to function.\n\n429\n00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.800\nAnd it's really not\nthat hard to get it set\n\n430\n00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.170\nup.\n&gt;&gt; Are there any advance settings we may\n\n431\n00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:22.820\nneed?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n432\n00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.010\ntechnically DNS is stashed under advance.\n\n433\n00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.920\nCuz I never really understood\nthis kind of need DNS from most\n\n434\n00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.640\nthe way people expect to work.\n\n435\n00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.760\nBut back under advanced,\n\n436\n00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.020\nthere's a lot of other tabs across\nthe top that most people ignore, right?\n\n437\n00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.060\nIn a home network,\nyou're gonna ignore this, right?\n\n438\n00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.740\nIf you're at Starbucks\nyou're gonna ignore this.\n\n439\n00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:45.030\nBut in an enterprise if you're at\na university, a school system.\n\n440\n00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:48.385\nSomething to that nature,\nthese become really important, right?\n\n441\n00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:49.040\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n442\n00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.220\n&gt;&gt; In an older Microsoft network,\n\n443\n00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.470\n&gt;&gt; They had a network\n\n444\n00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.050\nnaming system called WINS.\n\n445\n00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.840\nThe Windows Internetworking Name System.\n\n446\n00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.146\nAnd so, you might still have WINS\nservers that you have to punch in.\n\n447\n00:23:59.146 --> 00:24:01.166\nPretty rare, you don't normally see it.\n\n448\n00:24:01.166 --> 00:24:05.409\n802.1X though on the other hand,\nthat's a security protocol.\n\n449\n00:24:05.409 --> 00:24:08.307\nAnd it makes sure that any computer\nthat plugs in the network has\n\n450\n00:24:08.307 --> 00:24:11.000\nto be authorized or\nit's not allowed to talk at all.\n\n451\n00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.670\nIt's a great way to prevent\nrogue systems on your network.\n\n452\n00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.390\nIt's very complex to set up.\n\n453\n00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.910\nHome users aren't gonna do that, but\nin an enterprise base, it's very common.\n\n454\n00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.870\nAnd so in order to get your Mac on the\nnetwork you may need to get a certificate\n\n455\n00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.800\nfrom a security officer, or\nwhatever in your company.\n\n456\n00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.500\nAnd that would be configured\nhere under 802.1x.\n\n457\n00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.280\nA lot of schools use proxies,\nthat's the next tab.\n\n458\n00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.000\nA proxy is like a web filter,\n\n459\n00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.520\nthat you have to pass through\nin order to get to the Internet.\n\n460\n00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.340\nMost schools deploy it as a web proxy so\nthat they can filter out inappropriate\n\n461\n00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.065\naccess, and\nrestrict the websites people can get to.\n\n462\n00:24:43.065 --> 00:24:47.725\nThe proxies can actually proxy anything,\nso you'll see where you're Mac has\n\n463\n00:24:47.725 --> 00:24:51.184\nsupport for FPT Proxy,\nany kind of SOCKS based protocol,\n\n464\n00:24:51.184 --> 00:24:55.155\nany socket base network stuff,\nRTSP streaming for voice over IP.\n\n465\n00:24:55.155 --> 00:24:58.842\nYou've got all sorts of different\noptions in here, even Gopher\n\n466\n00:24:58.842 --> 00:25:03.214\nproxy which the Gopher protocol is not\nreally been active in 20 years, but\n\n467\n00:25:03.214 --> 00:25:06.492\nstill got support for it for\nsome reason, not sure why but\n\n468\n00:25:06.492 --> 00:25:07.656\nthat was there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n469\n00:25:07.656 --> 00:25:08.691\n&gt;&gt; So that's there,\n\n470\n00:25:08.691 --> 00:25:13.230\nand then lastly we got the hardware tab,\nthere's not much that you mess with here.\n\n471\n00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.443\nRemember I mentioned that MAC addresses\nare burned into your system at\n\n472\n00:25:16.443 --> 00:25:18.585\nthe factory, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n473\n00:25:18.585 --> 00:25:20.475\nBut, after that,\n\n474\n00:25:20.475 --> 00:25:25.807\nyou will see what you can configure what\nthe speed and the duplex of that link is.\n\n475\n00:25:25.807 --> 00:25:29.455\nSo if it's an Ethernet link it might\noperate like mine at 10 Megabit,\n\n476\n00:25:29.455 --> 00:25:34.025\n100 Megabit or a Gigabit, I could\nmanually set that speed to one of them.\n\n477\n00:25:34.025 --> 00:25:36.860\nOr if I wanted to do half-duplex or\nfull-duplex.\n\n478\n00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.140\nCan it send or receive, or\ncan it send and receive at the same time.\n\n479\n00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.220\nRight, I can pick that.\n\n480\n00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.450\nSo these are options that\nyou might need to tweak.\n\n481\n00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.820\nMost people will never need to mess\nwith any of these settings in here\n\n482\n00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.040\naside from DNS, right?\n\n483\n00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.295\nEverything else will pretty\nmuch get left the same, and\n\n484\n00:25:53.295 --> 00:25:56.660\nthat's usually going to be enough for\nmost people.\n\n485\n00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.130\nBut be aware of those settings there.\n\n486\n00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:01.280\nIf you are working in Enterprise space,\nyou might need to use those.\n\n487\n00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.790\n&gt;&gt; Another fantastic episode.\n\n488\n00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:06.260\nNetwork Configuration Part two,\nthere will be Part three.\n\n489\n00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.900\nMake sure you see Part one as well.\n\n490\n00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.070\nBefore we move on, Don,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n491\n00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:11.650\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned for\n\n492\n00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:13.750\nPart three cuz we're gonna take\na look at wireless networks.\n\n493\n00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.630\nAnd everything I've done so\nfar has been wired.\n\n494\n00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.170\nThe wireless side is different.\n\n495\n00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:20.970\nSo we'll get a chance to see that and\nbasically kinda dive in there.\n\n496\n00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.700\nThose are the most common these days.\n\n497\n00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.230\nSo I wanna make sure I show that to you\nguys so you can see the differences.\n\n498\n00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.450\nBut, otherwise you've seen basic\nnetwork configuration in this episode.\n\n499\n00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.305\nWe'll continue on in part three.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna walk down the wired\n\n500\n00:26:31.305 --> 00:26:31.930\nside.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n501\n00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:33.530\n&gt;&gt; Network configuration part three coming\n\n502\n00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:34.310\nyour way, and\n\n503\n00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:38.430\nby the way watch every single episode of\nApple certified support professional.\n\n504\n00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.130\nYou're gonna be so glad you did and\nyou'll be in the course library too.\n\n505\n00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:45.160\nWhere there is thousands of other videos\nthat are there to help you go further.\n\n506\n00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.390\nCheck those out, too.\n\n507\n00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.850\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n508\n00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.210\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n509\n00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.810\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n510\n00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:59.675\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n511\n00:26:59.675 --> 00:27:02.500\n[MUSIC]\n\n512\n00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.537\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Hey, glad to be back, Zach, and in this\nepisode we're gonna do the most important\n\n14\n00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:38.848\nnetwork configuration, In my opinion,\nat least, which is WiFi configuration.\n\n15\n00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:40.184\n&gt;&gt; I like WiFi.\n\n16\n00:00:40.184 --> 00:00:44.604\n&gt;&gt; Because every mac today has a wireless\ncard built into it, and it is what,\n\n17\n00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:47.330\nodds are going to be using in your Mac.\n\n18\n00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.718\nEven a Mac Mini or an iMac,\nthe desktop style,\n\n19\n00:00:49.718 --> 00:00:52.243\nthey still have wireless\ncards built into them.\n\n20\n00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:55.690\nSo Apple just assumes that's\nwhat you're going to have.\n\n21\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.195\nIn fact, when you start to do things\nlike Internet recovery they really like\n\n22\n00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:00.126\nthe WiFi networks,\n\n23\n00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:03.928\ncuz you can just jump right on, download\nthe OS data right from Apple's website.\n\n24\n00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:05.960\nAnd then you get your Mac\nback online really fast.\n\n25\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.870\nSo we're gonna take a look at the ins and\nouts of getting WiFi configured, and\n\n26\n00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.420\nsee what that's like inside\nof macOS 10.13 High Sierra.\n\n27\n00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.170\n&gt;&gt; And Don, how does a wireless\nnetwork differ from a wired network?\n\n28\n00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.614\nAll right, so it's almost a,\n\n29\n00:01:18.614 --> 00:01:25.020\nit differs really just in a couple areas\nthat you wouldn't normally notice.\n\n30\n00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.790\nSo for things like IP addressing and DNS,\nall the stuff we talked about in the last\n\n31\n00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.560\nepisode, that's all really the same for\nWiFi.\n\n32\n00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.510\nThe primary difference is that there's\nnot a physical cable plugged in.\n\n33\n00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.147\nIt's just a signal that's being\nthrown out into the air, right?\n\n34\n00:01:39.147 --> 00:01:42.284\nSlowly irradiating us and\nleading us to our death.\n\n35\n00:01:42.284 --> 00:01:44.031\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But allowing us to get to YouTube,\n\n36\n00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:45.098\nwhich is important.\n\n37\n00:01:45.098 --> 00:01:47.451\nSo, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's important, [LAUGH]\n\n38\n00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:49.440\n&gt;&gt; WiFi has no boundaries, right?\n\n39\n00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.700\nThat's the big difference, right?\n\n40\n00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.200\nI know that if I have a copper cable.\n\n41\n00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.300\nAnd I plug it into Zack's laptop,\nhe's on the network.\n\n42\n00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.830\nAnd I know if I unplug it,\nhe's not on the network.\n\n43\n00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.869\nAnd there's no real way to confuse that.\n\n44\n00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.330\nWith WiFi though there could\nbe eight different networks.\n\n45\n00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.390\nAnd I can't tell if I'm plugged in or\nnot, because it's just wireless.\n\n46\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.470\nThere's little, protons or\nsomething floating around in the air.\n\n47\n00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.470\nThat's the wrong term,\nI don't know what the heck they are but.\n\n48\n00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.150\n&gt;&gt; Frequencies.\n\n49\n00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.720\n&gt;&gt; Magical waves in the air, frequencies?\n\n50\n00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.390\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, I don't know.\n\n51\n00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.630\n&gt;&gt; All right, well something.\n\n52\n00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.370\nSo, anyway this stuff is passing\nthrough the air and I can't tell.\n\n53\n00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.650\nI could be connected to the wrong network,\nmight not know it, right?\n\n54\n00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.016\nThat's a risk that we don't\nhave with a wired network.\n\n55\n00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:34.692\nIn the WiFi world, they solved that\nthrough a few means, the main means is\n\n56\n00:02:34.692 --> 00:02:38.092\nthrough making it where we have to\nchoose to turn our controller on.\n\n57\n00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:40.612\nWe have to connect to these networks.\n\n58\n00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:43.220\nSo make sure you wanna mean by\nthat when I say turn it on.\n\n59\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.740\nIf I go into my system preferences, and in\nmy system preferences I go into network.\n\n60\n00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.700\nInside of network,\n\n61\n00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.190\nI wanna show you guys the difference\nbetween a wired connection and a WiFi.\n\n62\n00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.270\nOn a wired connection, it's immediately\nasking me, how do you get your IP address?\n\n63\n00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.840\nIs it DHCP, is it static?\n\n64\n00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.800\nWhat's your DNS server?\n\n65\n00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.920\nThese are things that we know we need.\n\n66\n00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.590\nIf I go to the Wi-Fi side, it's not\nasking me about an IP address at all.\n\n67\n00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.980\nIt's asking me, should the wireless\nantenna be turned on or off?\n\n68\n00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.770\nAnd if it's on, what network\nshould I be connected to, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.730\nThose are the settings that\nit is presenting to me here.\n\n70\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.750\nAnd that's because with Wi-Fi, we don't\nknow what networks are gonna be out there.\n\n71\n00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.890\nAnd it's not a matter of, they plugged\nin a cable, they must want to be on.\n\n72\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.070\nWe might see eight networks out there, and\none of them might be a malicious attacker.\n\n73\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.613\nWe don't wanna connect that one.\n\n74\n00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:36.889\nHow does a Mac know that's malicious?\n\n75\n00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.730\nIt doesn't, so\nit has to be leave that up to us.\n\n76\n00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.550\nWhen you do the initial install of Mac OS\n\n77\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.090\nif it sees a wireless network it\ncan give you a chance to join it.\n\n78\n00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.430\nAs you might want to set it up.\n\n79\n00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.450\nBut I got a laptop, I travel.\n\n80\n00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.500\nI go to hotel, or school, or\n\n81\n00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.750\nsomething more like that, I need to\nconnect to a new wireless network.\n\n82\n00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.480\nSo I can come in here, and\nI can drop down this box and\n\n83\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.552\nsee the different networks\nthat are out there, right?\n\n84\n00:03:58.552 --> 00:04:03.340\nSo ITProTV is what I'm connected to,\ncuz that's what I work for.\n\n85\n00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.670\nBut then, we got ITProTV-Guest, so\nif was a guest I've got that one.\n\n86\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.230\nAnd then I've got some I don't\nreally recognize, right?\n\n87\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.283\nGainesville Dev Academy or\nExceptionalDentistry,\n\n88\n00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:12.884\nthese are businesses that are around us.\n\n89\n00:04:12.884 --> 00:04:13.860\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n90\n00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.440\n&gt;&gt; And those might be perfectly safe\nnetworks, but they're not my network.\n\n91\n00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.715\nIf I try to connect to one, if I try to\nconnect to ExceptionalDentistry, let's go.\n\n92\n00:04:21.715 --> 00:04:23.220\n&gt;&gt; O-oh.\n\n93\n00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.250\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna ask for a password, right,\nor hopefully it asked for password,\n\n94\n00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.440\nnot everything does,\nwere any of those open?\n\n95\n00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.672\nLet's see, I cancel out,\n&gt;&gt; But the password there is Goodtooth.\n\n96\n00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:34.186\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or Badtooth you never know.\n\n97\n00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:35.329\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be, you're right.\n\n98\n00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:38.700\n&gt;&gt; So these are all secured,\nsee the little lock on them?\n\n99\n00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.370\nBut it could be public Wi-Fi,\none that doesn't have a lock,\n\n100\n00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.580\nthat's just sitting right there,\nyou can connect to and jump right on it.\n\n101\n00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.881\nWell, the Mac is waiting for\nyou to choose to get connected,\n\n102\n00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:50.714\nand once you pick you can jump on.\n\n103\n00:04:50.714 --> 00:04:55.152\nOnce you've connected a single time from\nthen on anytime you power on your system\n\n104\n00:04:55.152 --> 00:04:58.820\nit's gonna go in and connect, and\nit just pops on automatically.\n\n105\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.860\nWe don't have to worry about it, but\n\n106\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.370\nif it is a secure network you at least\nhave to provide that password one time.\n\n107\n00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.500\nAnd once you've done that, that\npassword gets stored in your keychain,\n\n108\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.420\nwhich we don't really see\nright here on this screen.\n\n109\n00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.830\nIf I go into Advanced, under Advanced,\n\n110\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.905\nthere's a list of all these WiFi\nnetworks that I've connected to.\n\n111\n00:05:18.905 --> 00:05:19.520\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n112\n00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.150\n&gt;&gt; And the keys that are stored\nalongside them, right?\n\n113\n00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.200\nSo it's keeping track of those keys.\n\n114\n00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.280\nSo if I ever go back out to wherever\nCenturyLink1588 is, I have no idea.\n\n115\n00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.470\nBut if I ever go back out there,\nit's got the key stored in my keychain.\n\n116\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.090\nIt'll reconnect and I can pop right on and\nget onto the network.\n\n117\n00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.460\nI don't have to provide it over and over.\n\n118\n00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.920\nI just have to provide it that one\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n119\n00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.550\nwhere do the credentials come from though?\n\n120\n00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.452\n&gt;&gt; That password it comes from\nwhoever runs this network, right?\n\n121\n00:05:47.452 --> 00:05:51.189\nI can't remember CentralLink1588,\nbut Pezet-Private I know that one,\n\n122\n00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:52.202\nthat's at my house.\n\n123\n00:05:52.202 --> 00:05:57.570\nSo at home that's the network that I\nbuilt up, and I picked the password.\n\n124\n00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.370\nMan, that's my password, and\nso if you visit the house.\n\n125\n00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.720\nExactly, you come over to the house and\nsay, Don can I get onto your wireless?\n\n126\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.010\nI'll tell you right, you gotta go to\na network administrator to get that.\n\n127\n00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.338\nIf you go to Starbucks,\nthey want everybody on the network.\n\n128\n00:06:10.338 --> 00:06:13.391\nSo they don't set a password,\nthat it's just open you can connect and\n\n129\n00:06:13.391 --> 00:06:14.660\nit's no big deal.\n\n130\n00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.130\nBut if it's a private network you've\ngotta have the password, right?\n\n131\n00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.960\nNow, if you are setting up laptops\nyou're a support professional.\n\n132\n00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.760\nAnd let's say, you work for a school.\n\n133\n00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.353\nSo you've got, [COUGH] Or not just\nschool you work for the school board.\n\n134\n00:06:28.353 --> 00:06:33.250\nSo you got 100 schools, and every school\nin the different wireless network.\n\n135\n00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.760\nThen you can actually take a Mac,\n\n136\n00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.070\nif you know you're gonna be sending it\nout to a teacher a particular school.\n\n137\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.320\nYou can come in here, and hit that + sign.\n\n138\n00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.990\nAnd you can add a network that\nyou've never even seen yet, right?\n\n139\n00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.800\nSo maybe this is the ITProTV-Beta, right?\n\n140\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.340\nAnd I can tell yeah, that's a WPA2 key.\n\n141\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.595\nAnd the password is password123, right?\n\n142\n00:06:56.595 --> 00:06:57.595\nWe punch that in.\n\n143\n00:06:57.595 --> 00:06:58.100\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n144\n00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.300\n&gt;&gt; And then, I can say OK.\n\n145\n00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.842\nAnd now, that's gonna be added in\nhere right down here at the bottom.\n\n146\n00:07:03.842 --> 00:07:07.915\nIt's on that list and\nnow whenever I see the network pop-up,\n\n147\n00:07:07.915 --> 00:07:12.790\nI can connect instead of giving\nthe credentials ahead of time.\n\n148\n00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.470\nNow those credentials right\nthere are really simple,\n\n149\n00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.770\nit's just a password, right?\n\n150\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.546\nThey sometimes refer to as a PSK or\na Pre-Shared Key.\n\n151\n00:07:20.546 --> 00:07:25.830\nA Pre-Shared Key,\nit's good cuz it's easy, but it's bad\n\n152\n00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:31.450\nin that if everybody at a particular\nschool is using the same password.\n\n153\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.350\nAnd then, we have somebody is doing\nsome bad stuff, and so we say no,\n\n154\n00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.540\nwe need to kick them off the network.\n\n155\n00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.130\nWe can't,\ncuz everybody is using the same password.\n\n156\n00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.120\nWhat if I change the password?\n\n157\n00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.250\nNow everybody is gonna change\nthe password, that's not effective.\n\n158\n00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.260\nSo in enterprise environments,\n\n159\n00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.160\na lot of times they'll use what are called\ncertificates for authentication.\n\n160\n00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.951\nI mentioned 802.1X authentication\nin the last episode.\n\n161\n00:07:52.951 --> 00:07:54.172\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n162\n00:07:54.172 --> 00:07:54.990\n&gt;&gt; That's certificate-based.\n\n163\n00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.436\nSo let me go back in here, and\nI'm gonna take that ITProTV-Beta, and\n\n164\n00:07:57.436 --> 00:07:59.230\nlet me just remove that.\n\n165\n00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:05.140\nSo it's gone, and\nI'm gonna add it back here, ITProTV-Beta.\n\n166\n00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.260\nAnd under Security, I pick WPA2 Personal.\n\n167\n00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.807\nI tell this personal ones,\nthose are Pre-Shared Keys, the Passwords.\n\n168\n00:08:11.807 --> 00:08:16.320\nBut if we go a little further,\nyou are at Enterprise, right?\n\n169\n00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.420\nEnterprises, they are not\ngonna use a password,\n\n170\n00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.130\nthey are going to use 802.1X certificates.\n\n171\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.250\nAnd that's all handle to the extensible\nauthentication protocol or EAP.\n\n172\n00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.584\nTLS is Transport Layer Security,\nyou don't need to know that for the exam.\n\n173\n00:08:30.584 --> 00:08:32.172\nBut you can come in, and\n\n174\n00:08:32.172 --> 00:08:36.394\nyou can pick a certificate that\nyou have issued to your system.\n\n175\n00:08:36.394 --> 00:08:39.154\nAnd if the administrator has\napproved your certificate,\n\n176\n00:08:39.154 --> 00:08:41.923\nthen you'll be able to connect\nto that wireless network.\n\n177\n00:08:41.923 --> 00:08:45.600\nYou don't even provide a password,\nyour certificate is your password.\n\n178\n00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.185\nThe nice part here is that every\nuser has their own certificate.\n\n179\n00:08:49.185 --> 00:08:53.694\nSo if Zach is causing trouble on the\nnetwork I can just revoke his certificate,\n\n180\n00:08:53.694 --> 00:08:57.199\nand it kicks him off, and\neverybody else stays on just fine.\n\n181\n00:08:57.199 --> 00:08:58.260\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n182\n00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.606\n&gt;&gt; In the Enterprise space its not only\nmakes sense, it actually gives you\n\n183\n00:09:01.606 --> 00:09:04.070\nfunctionality that you've got to have\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n184\n00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.430\n&gt;&gt; It's an important thing.\n\n185\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.186\nBut boy,\nis it a pain in the butt to set up.\n\n186\n00:09:07.186 --> 00:09:09.525\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is really hard to get set up\n\n187\n00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:13.240\non the server side,\non the wireless axis point side.\n\n188\n00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.290\nBut if you've got that\nin your environment,\n\n189\n00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.040\nthen your network administrators,\nthey'll provide you with the certificate\n\n190\n00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.470\ninformation to get that added on here and\nconnected.\n\n191\n00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:27.221\nSo from that respect, adding a wireless\nnetwork can actually be really hard.\n\n192\n00:09:27.221 --> 00:09:30.130\nIt can be tough to provide\nall of that information.\n\n193\n00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:34.336\nBut once it's in there,\nthe rest of it is pretty straightforward.\n\n194\n00:09:34.336 --> 00:09:38.136\nOnce I go under Advanced,\nI can see a TCPIP screen, and\n\n195\n00:09:38.136 --> 00:09:41.620\nnow it looks a lot more\nlike the physical adaptor.\n\n196\n00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.490\nSo I can say, yeah, I wanna do this\nmanual, here's my IP, here's my router.\n\n197\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.706\nI can go over to DNS,\nhere's the DNS service I wanna use, and\n\n198\n00:09:49.706 --> 00:09:53.573\nI can provide all the information\nright here, just like a wire adoptor.\n\n199\n00:09:53.573 --> 00:09:59.950\nThe big difference is it's got to know\nthe SSID, the name of the network.\n\n200\n00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.731\nSee all these networks here, the F-unit.\n\n201\n00:10:03.731 --> 00:10:05.193\nThat's actually the,\n\n202\n00:10:05.193 --> 00:10:09.150\nI don't know if you've ever seen\nthe Security Weekly podcast.\n\n203\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:15.696\nThey have two studios and it's the G-unit\nand the F-unit in this building.\n\n204\n00:10:15.696 --> 00:10:17.450\nAnd so that's one of their networks.\n\n205\n00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.960\nAnd so, I had to know that was\nthe name of that network to connect.\n\n206\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.940\nIt's now what's stored here.\n\n207\n00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:28.045\nSo that name is called\na service set identifier or\n\n208\n00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:32.784\nSSID, and every Wi-Fi network has an SSID.\n\n209\n00:10:32.784 --> 00:10:35.309\nYou need that name,\nyou need the credentials, and\n\n210\n00:10:35.309 --> 00:10:40.060\nonce you're connected then you treat it\njust like any physical adapter that's out.\n\n211\n00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.374\n&gt;&gt; Are there any extra\nsettings we may need?\n\n212\n00:10:42.374 --> 00:10:45.083\n&gt;&gt; There's a couple of things\nyou might wanna be aware\n\n213\n00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:47.480\nof first off actually\nlet me go back out here.\n\n214\n00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.758\nI wanna show you one setting\nlet me cancel this screen,\n\n215\n00:10:50.758 --> 00:10:55.620\nright back out here, so I'm in\nsystem preferences and then network.\n\n216\n00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.840\nWhen you choose Wi-Fi there is a little\noption here that I absolutely hate.\n\n217\n00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.934\nIn new versions-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:11:01.934 --> 00:11:03.148\n&gt;&gt; In newer versions of Mac OS,\n\n219\n00:11:03.148 --> 00:11:04.830\nthis is turned off by default.\n\n220\n00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.120\nIn older versions of Mac OS\nthis was turned on by default,\n\n221\n00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.460\nask to join new networks.\n\n222\n00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.776\nWhat used to happen,\nwas if you turned on your Mac,\n\n223\n00:11:13.776 --> 00:11:18.268\nand it saw a non-secure network,\nit would connect automatically.\n\n224\n00:11:18.268 --> 00:11:20.738\nIt would say, it's not secured,\nyou probably wanna be on it,\n\n225\n00:11:20.738 --> 00:11:22.930\nlet me just go ahead and connect, right?\n\n226\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:27.051\nWell, in the nicer trustier type of days,\nyou can do stuff like that.\n\n227\n00:11:27.051 --> 00:11:30.678\nBut today, the unsecure network\nare usually the malicious ones.\n\n228\n00:11:30.678 --> 00:11:32.880\nThe ones that people\nare trying to get your data.\n\n229\n00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.963\nApple doesn't do that anymore,\nthey've got it turned off.\n\n230\n00:11:34.963 --> 00:11:37.469\nBut if you're supporting\nolder versions of Mac OS.\n\n231\n00:11:37.469 --> 00:11:40.704\nIf you saw Maveric Systems, Maverics\ndefaulted to that being turned on,\n\n232\n00:11:40.704 --> 00:11:42.840\nMaverics isn't even that old, right?\n\n233\n00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.980\nSo those are some of the things we have to\nworry about on wireless that we don't have\n\n234\n00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.340\nto worry about on wired.\n\n235\n00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.930\nAnother thing is,\nI mentioned SSIDs, right?\n\n236\n00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.500\nWhen I look for\na network the names are usually published.\n\n237\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.200\nThese are names that I'm\nseeing on the network.\n\n238\n00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.530\nSome of them I'm seeing twice, ops,\n[LAUGH] But some of them I'm seeing twice,\n\n239\n00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.350\nusually because of a guest network and\na parent.\n\n240\n00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.650\nSometimes you'll see them twice because\nthey might have a 2.4 gigahertz and\n\n241\n00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.450\n5 gigahertz, like different frequencies.\n\n242\n00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:19.422\nBut there might also be networks\nwith what's called a hidden SSID.\n\n243\n00:12:19.422 --> 00:12:21.260\nThey don't have to advertise their SSID.\n\n244\n00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.810\nThey have to have one, but\nthey don't have to advertise it.\n\n245\n00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.480\nSo if there's a secret network out there,\nthe administrator might tell you that.\n\n246\n00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.360\nHey, our network is called ITProTV-Beta,\nbut it's not published, so\n\n247\n00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.450\nyou've gotta add it.\n\n248\n00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.750\nAnd for those, you would have\nto choose Join Other Network.\n\n249\n00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.908\nAnd then, you would have to type in the\nnetwork name and get that put in there,\n\n250\n00:12:38.908 --> 00:12:41.255\nbecause your system is not\ngonna find it automatically.\n\n251\n00:12:41.255 --> 00:12:45.722\nSo that's another thing that you might\nbump into that's out there on that\n\n252\n00:12:45.722 --> 00:12:46.452\nSSID side.\n\n253\n00:12:46.452 --> 00:12:49.997\nThe only other thing that I wanna\nmention before you kind of wind down\n\n254\n00:12:49.997 --> 00:12:53.045\non wireless is everything that\nI've been talking about so\n\n255\n00:12:53.045 --> 00:12:56.860\nfar, this is what's called\ninfrastructure mode, wireless.\n\n256\n00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.443\nAnd in infrastructure mode you're\ntalking to a wireless access point and\n\n257\n00:13:00.443 --> 00:13:03.460\nother computers are talking to\na wireless access point also.\n\n258\n00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.400\nAnd then, you're able to see each\nother and everybody's happy.\n\n259\n00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.410\nYou don't have to have\na wireless access point though.\n\n260\n00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:13.317\nLet's say, that Zack and I are on a train\nbecause we take trains all the time.\n\n261\n00:13:13.317 --> 00:13:18.430\n&gt;&gt; Everyday, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [COUGHS] Sorry,\n\n262\n00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.130\nFlorida is not the most\ntrained friendly state.\n\n263\n00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.010\n&gt;&gt; No, it is not.\n\n264\n00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.280\n&gt;&gt; So anyhow we are on a train though for\nwhatever reason, and\n\n265\n00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.490\nI wanna share a file with Zach's laptop.\n\n266\n00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.420\nOkay, well, I don't have\na network jack on my my computer,\n\n267\n00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.890\nyou don't have a network\njack on your computer.\n\n268\n00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.200\nWe have wireless adapters but\nthere's no wireless network on a train,\n\n269\n00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.440\nhow can we do this?\n\n270\n00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.850\n&gt;&gt; You can create what's called\nan ad hoc wireless network.\n\n271\n00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.690\nAn ad hoc wireless network is one\nthat's directly between two computers,\n\n272\n00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:49.010\nnot between a computer an access\npoint that's infrastructure mode.\n\n273\n00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:53.340\nAn ad hoc networking be done right\nbetween two different systems.\n\n274\n00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.067\nWhen I look at this, when I look\nat the SSIDs and stuff in here,\n\n275\n00:13:57.067 --> 00:14:01.098\nand I go to Join Other Network,\nthat's all infrastructure mode.\n\n276\n00:14:01.098 --> 00:14:03.722\nAnd even when I go under Advance,\n\n277\n00:14:03.722 --> 00:14:09.650\nall of this stuff is really talking\nabout computer and access point.\n\n278\n00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.320\nIf I wanna create an ad\nhoc network though,\n\n279\n00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.300\nyou can do it a couple of different ways.\n\n280\n00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.604\nWhat I normally do is you've got\nthis option down here at the bottom\n\n281\n00:14:17.604 --> 00:14:19.675\nthat says Show Wi-Fi status in menu bar.\n\n282\n00:14:19.675 --> 00:14:22.090\nI normally have that turned on.\n\n283\n00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.460\nAnd when you look at the bar up top,\nand you click on the menu item,\n\n284\n00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.760\nyou get that big list,\nyou've got create a network right there.\n\n285\n00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.050\nyou can create and ad hoc network, and\n\n286\n00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.890\nactually build that to be able\nto connect between two systems.\n\n287\n00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:41.360\nIf I choose that, now I have create\na computer-to-computer network.\n\n288\n00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.950\nAnd I get to pick a name, see mine is\ngonna be called Don's MacBook Pro.\n\n289\n00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.150\nI get to pick a channel number for\n\n290\n00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:51.490\nit, it's defaulting to\nthe lower 2.4 gigahertz, but\n\n291\n00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.050\nI might wanna go to a higher 5 gigahertz\nchannel to get better performance.\n\n292\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:58.160\nIf the machines are close by you'll\nactually get a faster connection that\n\n293\n00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.188\nway as well.\n\n294\n00:14:59.188 --> 00:15:01.470\nSo it will kinda depends on your Mac, but\n\n295\n00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.680\nyou'll usually end up\nwith a faster connection.\n\n296\n00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.010\nThese give you a faster connection but\n\n297\n00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.210\na shorter range, which doesn't matter\nif they're right next to each other.\n\n298\n00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.750\nBut if there's any distance,\nyou get more range up here, but\n\n299\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.270\na slower connection,\nthat's typically how that works out.\n\n300\n00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.191\nSo I might choose this bump up\nhere at the top and create it.\n\n301\n00:15:17.191 --> 00:15:20.699\nSo I'm now creating and\nad hoc that we call Don's MacBook Pro.\n\n302\n00:15:20.699 --> 00:15:23.478\nAnd anybody in the near vicinity of me,\n\n303\n00:15:23.478 --> 00:15:29.360\nwill now see a new Wi-Fi network being\nadvertised called Don's MacBook Pro.\n\n304\n00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.740\nAnd so, if they wanna join it they can.\n\n305\n00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.165\nAnd see how my Wi-Fi adapter,\nall the settings kind of blanked out?\n\n306\n00:15:35.165 --> 00:15:35.920\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n307\n00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.930\n&gt;&gt; That's because my network adapter\nis now flipped into ad hoc mode.\n\n308\n00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.000\nAnd so it's just sitting there waiting.\n\n309\n00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.403\nAnd in the menu bar up top, this is gonna\nbe really hard to see because of Apple's\n\n310\n00:15:46.403 --> 00:15:49.983\ndesign aesthetic of white on light\ngray because that makes sense\n\n311\n00:15:49.983 --> 00:15:50.777\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n\n312\n00:15:50.777 --> 00:15:52.513\n&gt;&gt; But it's got a little computer in\n\n313\n00:15:52.513 --> 00:15:54.510\nthe middle of the wireless signal\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n314\n00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.575\n&gt;&gt; And that just means I'm waiting for\nanother to connect.\n\n315\n00:15:57.575 --> 00:16:01.130\nSo Zack, could connect or other people and\nthen we could exchange files and\n\n316\n00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.280\nthings directly between each other.\n\n317\n00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.050\nThat's an ad hoc network.\n\n318\n00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:10.660\nI'll be honest with you, most people don't\nuse the ad hoc networks, because well,\n\n319\n00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.660\nyou usually have wireless networks\npresent, so we don't need them.\n\n320\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:19.080\nBut the other reason is they're\nnot incredibly useful these days,\n\n321\n00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.910\nas far as sharing files and things.\n\n322\n00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.270\nPeople can use AirDrop and\n\n323\n00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:24.370\nother technologies on\na regular wireless network.\n\n324\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.540\nSo ad hoc networks are typically\nused by video gamers these days.\n\n325\n00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.230\nBut if you're ever in a pinch and\nyou just need to quickly get\n\n326\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.160\nfiles between two systems and\nyou don't have a network available.\n\n327\n00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.215\nThat ad hoc network can actually\nbe a pretty handy thing, so\n\n328\n00:16:37.215 --> 00:16:40.795\none extra feature that you\nmight want to be aware of.\n\n329\n00:16:40.795 --> 00:16:44.189\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic information,\nnetwork configuration part three,\n\n330\n00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:47.590\nyou'll see part one,\npart two as well before we move forward.\n\n331\n00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.873\nDon, anything else you'd like to say?\n\n332\n00:16:49.873 --> 00:16:53.944\n&gt;&gt; Obviously, there's a lot more special\nedge case scenarios with networks.\n\n333\n00:16:53.944 --> 00:16:56.806\nBut I think at this point we talked\nabout the fundamentals in part one,\n\n334\n00:16:56.806 --> 00:17:00.410\nwe talked about wired connections in part\ntwo, and wireless here in part three.\n\n335\n00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.805\nWe've covered everything they\nexpect you to have on the exam, and\n\n336\n00:17:02.805 --> 00:17:05.562\nmost of what you're getting going to\nencounter out there in the real world.\n\n337\n00:17:05.562 --> 00:17:07.232\nBut new network technologies come out all\n\n338\n00:17:07.232 --> 00:17:08.162\nthe time-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n339\n00:17:08.162 --> 00:17:12.139\n&gt;&gt; So just try and stay current, read\nabout the standards that are coming out,\n\n340\n00:17:12.139 --> 00:17:16.492\nespecially in the wireless world,\nyour newer Macs are gonna have 802.11 and\n\n341\n00:17:16.492 --> 00:17:17.460\nan AC card.\n\n342\n00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.060\nYour older Macs might have 802.11 a, b or\n\n343\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.840\ng cards, those are all going to\naffect performance and speed.\n\n344\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.650\nJust beware that there is\nvariation from system to system.\n\n345\n00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:27.200\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Don.\n\n346\n00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:27.750\nWell done,\n\n347\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.275\nmake sure you see everything in the Apple\nCertified Support Professional series.\n\n348\n00:17:31.275 --> 00:17:33.370\nWe're gonna be so glad that you did.\n\n349\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:33.970\nAnd by the way,\n\n350\n00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.750\nyou'll be in the course library,\nthere's thousands of other videos.\n\n351\n00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.770\nThey're designed to do one thing.\n\n352\n00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.050\nHope you go further,\nso check this out too.\n\n353\n00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.871\nTel me about you know about ITProTV.\n\n354\n00:17:42.871 --> 00:17:44.530\nITProTV is bench worthy.\n\n355\n00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.570\nThanks for watching.\n\n356\n00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:46.580\nI'm Zack Memos.\n\n357\n00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.440\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:16.085\nchoosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.085 --> 00:00:20.823\nI am your host Zach Memos for this episode\nof Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n8\n00:00:20.823 --> 00:00:24.898\nWe're gonna be looking at Advanced\nnetwork configuration in this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:24.898 --> 00:00:30.010\nAnd I know of nobody else but Don Pezet,\nwho can show us what that's all about.\n\n10\n00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.563\nDon, good to have you.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming back Zack, and\n\n11\n00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:33.731\nin this episode we are gonna look\nat Advancednetwork configuration.\n\n12\n00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:36.352\nAnd I know,\nIf you watch on network configuration,\n\n13\n00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:39.639\nyou might remember when we hit\na little button labeled Advanced.\n\n14\n00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:43.310\nAnd we so some Advanced features, it's\nnot what we're talking about right here.\n\n15\n00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.170\nSo what are talking about in this\nepisode are actually alternative\n\n16\n00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.046\ntypes of networks.\n\n17\n00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:51.439\nAnd variations on those network configs\nthat we might need to support depending on\n\n18\n00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:53.510\nhow complex our environment is.\n\n19\n00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.886\nSo you might have a network\nconfiguration for one location,\n\n20\n00:00:55.886 --> 00:00:57.899\na different configuration for\nanother location.\n\n21\n00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.050\nYou might have a VPN for\ndoing remote access.\n\n22\n00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.330\nAll of these are different\n\n23\n00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.360\nfactors that come together in\nAdvanced Networking Solutions.\n\n24\n00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.811\nA regular user doesn't worry\nabout any of these but\n\n25\n00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:09.927\nas a support professional you likely will.\n\n26\n00:01:09.927 --> 00:01:11.865\nSo we're gonna take a look at\nthem right here in this episode.\n\n27\n00:01:11.865 --> 00:01:12.911\nAnd see how they work?\n\n28\n00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:16.253\nAnd how we can use them for\nfame, profit, and-\n\n29\n00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:17.276\n&gt;&gt; Glory, [LAUGH]\n\n30\n00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:18.881\n&gt;&gt; Win the affection of our coworkers.\n\n31\n00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:20.565\n&gt;&gt; Let's start with network locations.\n\n32\n00:01:20.565 --> 00:01:22.368\nHow do they work?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n33\n00:01:22.368 --> 00:01:26.791\nnetwork locations are a neat feature that\nI really wish I had back in the 90s,\n\n34\n00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:29.610\nwhen I was doing a lot of consulting work.\n\n35\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.213\nThat if you travel a lot and\nyou're moving from network to network, and\n\n36\n00:01:33.213 --> 00:01:36.166\nyou have different requirements\non different networks.\n\n37\n00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:40.369\nIt would be neat to not be going in and\nreconfigure all your network settings.\n\n38\n00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.635\nSo for example,\nif I go home I might use DHCP, and\n\n39\n00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:46.990\njust grab an address that's available.\n\n40\n00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.381\nBut when I come here to work,\nI might wanna have static IP address so\n\n41\n00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:51.789\nit's always set the same.\n\n42\n00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.215\nAnd then, if I go to a hotel I might\nwant to use DHCP for the address but\n\n43\n00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:59.370\nthen I might want to\ndo static DNS servers.\n\n44\n00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.500\nAll these little variations and\nwhat people like me used to have to\n\n45\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.670\ndo is every time I went to a location like\nthat, I would have to change my config.\n\n46\n00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.450\nWell, if it's between home and work,\nI would have to do that every single day.\n\n47\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.459\nI come into work,\nset my static IP, go home,\n\n48\n00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.478\nset back to DHCP super annoying.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n49\n00:02:19.478 --> 00:02:20.904\n&gt;&gt; So what we can do inside a Mac OS\n\n50\n00:02:20.904 --> 00:02:23.180\nis we can create what we\nare called locations.\n\n51\n00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.110\nAnd I can find location called home,\nor a location called work, and\n\n52\n00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.060\nin that location I can define all\nof my network configurations.\n\n53\n00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.760\nAnd it's saved right there.\n\n54\n00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.420\nSo I'm gonna reconfigure,\nI'm just having to flip in between them.\n\n55\n00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.411\nAnd the system actually works pretty easy.\n\n56\n00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:43.007\nIt's actually one of the one of the\nscreens that we saw others super easy to\n\n57\n00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:44.460\noverlook and what people do.\n\n58\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.338\nSo let me show you real quick.\n\n59\n00:02:45.338 --> 00:02:48.348\nIf I go into my System Preferences, and\n\n60\n00:02:48.348 --> 00:02:52.920\ninside the System Preferences I'm\ngonna go into Network.\n\n61\n00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.091\nAnd inside of Network, here's all the\ndifferent settings that we were looking at\n\n62\n00:02:57.091 --> 00:03:00.140\nin the regular\nNetwork Configuration episodes.\n\n63\n00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.600\nBut one thing that I glanced\nover was this guy right up here,\n\n64\n00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.860\nat the top where it says,\nLocation: Automatic.\n\n65\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.250\nWhat that means is that,\n\n66\n00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.810\nit's basically just treating everybody\nas the same location right now.\n\n67\n00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.090\nEverything is Automatic.\n\n68\n00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.030\nBut I can come in, and I can teach\nit about different Locations, right?\n\n69\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.340\nNow for me, I've got all these\nweird network adaptors over here.\n\n70\n00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.570\nBut really I just use two adaptors.\n\n71\n00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.900\nI have a Wi-Fi network and I've got a USB\nEthernet adaptor right here that I use.\n\n72\n00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.130\nNow that USB Ethernet adaptor, I only use\nthat one when I'm here at the office.\n\n73\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.360\nIt's in the docking\nstation that's on my desk.\n\n74\n00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.940\nBut when in their home, I just use Wi-Fi.\n\n75\n00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.700\nSo different configurations for\nthe different places.\n\n76\n00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.880\nI can drop down that list and\nchoose to edit the locations.\n\n77\n00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.880\nAnd now, I can come in and\nI can name them.\n\n78\n00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.440\nSo right now,\nI've kind of got a set-up for me at work.\n\n79\n00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.240\nSo I'm gonna take this\none that says automatic,\n\n80\n00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.730\nand I'll just hit that little gear,\nand I'm gonna choose to rename it.\n\n81\n00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.110\nAnd I'm gonna call that or actually,\n\n82\n00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.590\nyou know what here,\nI'll leave Automatic alone.\n\n83\n00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.620\nI'm gonna duplicate it.\n\n84\n00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.600\nAnd so, I'm just kinda cloning\nthat automatic configuration and\n\n85\n00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.720\nI'll rename this one.\n\n86\n00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.160\nSo I'm gonna call that Work, and then,\nI'll duplicate it one more time.\n\n87\n00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.670\nAnd on this other one,\nI'm gonna call it Home.\n\n88\n00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.834\nAnd now, what I can do, ops, I'm gonna\ntry to rename it, there we go, all right.\n\n89\n00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:23.797\nSo now what I can do is I've got\nthese three different configurations.\n\n90\n00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:26.600\nI duplicated so\nto preserve everything that was there.\n\n91\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.120\nIf you just hit the +, you can add one\nin that is completely blank, right?\n\n92\n00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.080\nSo you maybe this is when I'm at a Hotel.\n\n93\n00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.370\nAnd so this one will be completely blank.\n\n94\n00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.840\nBut now, I have these different\nLocations to pick from.\n\n95\n00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.380\nAnd so, I can take for\nexample the Hotel, right?\n\n96\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.060\nSo I'll pick that Location.\n\n97\n00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.640\nAnd see how my adapter has\njust got a lot smaller.\n\n98\n00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.100\nThat USB adaptor that's in my document\nstation in the office is gone, right?\n\n99\n00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.010\nBecause this Location has never seen it.\n\n100\n00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.450\nAnd, the AJA Mini-Config\nsoftware it's gone,\n\n101\n00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.540\nbecause this location has never seen it.\n\n102\n00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.800\nW-iFi, it sees that,\nI've got Wi-Fi, right?\n\n103\n00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.170\nBut Wi-Fi is turned on and\nnot connected right now.\n\n104\n00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.210\nSo it's just kind of\nsitting here thinking, and\n\n105\n00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.400\nthat's because I don't\nhave a configuration.\n\n106\n00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.995\nI probably don't want\nto connect to IT ProTV.\n\n107\n00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.230\nI probably wanna connect to some\nother networks, cuz I'm in a Hotel.\n\n108\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.510\nAnd I probably want all automatic\nsetting and things that nature.\n\n109\n00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.054\nBut when I'm at Home,\nwe'll flip over to Home.\n\n110\n00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:25.953\nNow, I'm looking at my home configuration\nand I see my adapters, and see how AJA and\n\n111\n00:05:25.953 --> 00:05:27.678\nthe USB, those reappeared.\n\n112\n00:05:27.678 --> 00:05:31.685\nAnd that's because I cloned,\nI duplicated the automatic configuration.\n\n113\n00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:35.566\nWell, I don't use that AJA device at Home,\nso I can come in and I can remove that, so\n\n114\n00:05:35.566 --> 00:05:37.110\nI'll get rid of that.\n\n115\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.850\nI'll get rid of the other AJA one.\n\n116\n00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.470\nThat USB adapter that's on my desk so\n\n117\n00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.450\nI don't need that in here\neither I can get rid of it.\n\n118\n00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.870\nSo kinda cutting down what we've got.\n\n119\n00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.628\nMaybe I don't use Bluetooth or\nthe Thunderbolt Bridge at home,\n\n120\n00:05:50.628 --> 00:05:52.988\nactually I don't use\nthe Thunderbolt Bridge at home.\n\n121\n00:05:52.988 --> 00:05:56.280\nSo I could get rid of that as well, but\nI'll leave it, it doesn't hurt anything.\n\n122\n00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.000\nBut on the Wi-Fi side, when I'm at home,\nI'm connected to one of my home networks,\n\n123\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.060\nwhich is not here in the list.\n\n124\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.480\nSo I'm gonna choose to\njoin a different network.\n\n125\n00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.880\nAnd I'll just come in and\nI'll punch in what my network is at home.\n\n126\n00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.376\nAnd I'll punch in what the password is and\nall that other information.\n\n127\n00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.292\nI'm gonna do and get that set it.\n\n128\n00:06:18.292 --> 00:06:20.648\nNow, I can't join cuz\nthat wireless never is\n\n129\n00:06:20.648 --> 00:06:21.330\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; But-\n\n130\n00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.030\n&gt;&gt; But if it were, I would join it and\n\n131\n00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.820\nthen my home configuration\nwould remember that.\n\n132\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.900\nSo it would now become part\nof this home configuration.\n\n133\n00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.420\nIf I wanted to use DHCP, which I do.\n\n134\n00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.077\nI can go under Advanced here, and I can\nmake sure that I'm setting up for DHCP.\n\n135\n00:06:37.077 --> 00:06:39.680\nWhich I am, so I'm good to go.\n\n136\n00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.917\nBut back at the office,\nwhen I flip this over to Work,\n\n137\n00:06:43.917 --> 00:06:49.486\ninside of the Work Location here,\nmaybe I do want a static IP address.\n\n138\n00:06:49.486 --> 00:06:52.160\nAnd I always want to\nhave that same address.\n\n139\n00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.200\nSo from my Wi-fi, if I take a look\nat it right now, I'm set for DHCP.\n\n140\n00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.030\nSo if I go under the Settings here,\nI can see a separate DHCP.\n\n141\n00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.400\nI can switch that over to doing manual,\nand\n\n142\n00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.410\nI can punch in what I\nwant my address to be.\n\n143\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.632\nWhatever that just happens to be for\nmy network, and\n\n144\n00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:14.697\nonce I get this in here in DNS servers.\n\n145\n00:07:14.697 --> 00:07:19.472\nWhatever it is that I'm gonna be using for\nDNS I get that set, and so\n\n146\n00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:22.020\nnow my Wi-Fi adapter knows.\n\n147\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.639\nThen here when I'm in the office,\nI'm gonna use this static IP,\n\n148\n00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:30.230\nbut when at home,\nthis Wi-Fi adoptors is gonna use DHCP.\n\n149\n00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.570\nSo now,\nI've got two different configurations and\n\n150\n00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.380\ninstead of having to go through.\n\n151\n00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.060\nAnd overwrite this configuration\nday after day, over and over again.\n\n152\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.090\nNow, I can just move\nbetween the Locations.\n\n153\n00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.550\nAnd it'll understand what\nthose settings need to be?\n\n154\n00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.400\nWhat should be present, and\nhow I want that to be configured?\n\n155\n00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.942\nThat's all part of that\nLocation functionality.\n\n156\n00:07:49.942 --> 00:07:55.180\nAnd it's super easy to overlook, because\nthe default is it stays at automatic.\n\n157\n00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.833\nAnd when it's set to automatic Everything\njust kinda works as one location.\n\n158\n00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:02.829\nIt's not until you create more than one\nlocation that this actually starts to\n\n159\n00:08:02.829 --> 00:08:03.830\nserve a purpose.\n\n160\n00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.320\nBut if you're traveller and you have a lot\nof different configurations to deal with,\n\n161\n00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.969\nthis is super, super handy.\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\n\n162\n00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:12.456\nhow do you switch between locations?\n&gt;&gt; There's two ways, right?\n\n163\n00:08:12.456 --> 00:08:14.289\nSo technically,\nevery time I hit this drop down box,\n\n164\n00:08:14.289 --> 00:08:16.297\nI am switching between the locations.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n165\n00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:17.490\n&gt;&gt; But you don't want to do this\n\n166\n00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.393\nevery time, right?\n\n167\n00:08:18.393 --> 00:08:21.282\nHere, let me apply this.\n\n168\n00:08:21.282 --> 00:08:24.057\nSo I go home and I'm like, all right.\n\n169\n00:08:24.057 --> 00:08:24.974\nI'm at home, I need to switch.\n\n170\n00:08:24.974 --> 00:08:28.996\nSo I don't want to have to go\nto System Preferences, and\n\n171\n00:08:28.996 --> 00:08:33.030\nthen Network, and then pick Home,\nand then hit Apply.\n\n172\n00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.788\nThat's just a lot of steps to go through.\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of steps, yeah.\n\n173\n00:08:35.788 --> 00:08:39.000\nBy default, before you've created\nany of these, this is the only way,\n\n174\n00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.800\nyou've gotta come in here and get to it.\n\n175\n00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.960\nBut the moment you've created\nmore than one location,\n\n176\n00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.650\nyou'll see a new option in\nyour Apple menu up top.\n\n177\n00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.530\nAnd if you're sharp eyed,\nyou might have already seen it.\n\n178\n00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:53.010\nWhen I pull down my Apple menu,\nand I go to System Preferences.\n\n179\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.365\nWell if I don't go to System Preferences,\nright beneath it is Location, and\n\n180\n00:08:57.365 --> 00:08:59.721\nhere is all my locations.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n181\n00:08:59.721 --> 00:09:01.750\n&gt;&gt; And so now I can just say,\n\n182\n00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.578\nhey I'm at home, so I want DACP.\n\n183\n00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:07.450\nSo I pull down my Apple menu,\ngo to Location, go to Home.\n\n184\n00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:11.621\nAnd now it knows, use DACP,\nget on the private wireless network.\n\n185\n00:09:11.621 --> 00:09:15.983\nOr I hit that Apple menu,\nI go to Location, I tell it I'm at Work.\n\n186\n00:09:15.983 --> 00:09:19.268\nAnd so now it says okay,\nget on the ITProTV network and\n\n187\n00:09:19.268 --> 00:09:22.276\nset a static IP of 10.0 whatever right?\n\n188\n00:09:22.276 --> 00:09:23.690\nSo now it knows what to do and\n\n189\n00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.120\nall I'm having to do is come up here and\nhit that menu.\n\n190\n00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.670\nOnce you hit the menu,\nnow it's done and you've switched over.\n\n191\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.270\nSo super easy to switch.\n\n192\n00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.130\nYou don't see it up here in\nyour menu bar or anything.\n\n193\n00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.000\nIt just kind of comes and\ngoes based on what you need.\n\n194\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.250\nBut it's a really cool way to do this and\n\n195\n00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.680\nnow I've got those\nconfigurations stored separate.\n\n196\n00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.989\nAnother example where I use this,\nif you get a brand new Apple, well,\n\n197\n00:09:46.989 --> 00:09:51.372\nthe Time Capsule's like this, or\nreally third-party network gear,\n\n198\n00:09:51.372 --> 00:09:56.581\nweb cameras, routers, whatever, they\nusually have a static IP assigned to them.\n\n199\n00:09:56.581 --> 00:09:59.159\nSomething like 192.168.1.1.\n\n200\n00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:04.300\nWell, here at the office we\nuse 10.0.222.10 or whatever.\n\n201\n00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.170\nSo it's a different IP range.\n\n202\n00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.081\nSo I'll actually create a couple of\nlocations that are designed to help me\n\n203\n00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:12.300\ncommunicate on these default networks.\n\n204\n00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:17.043\nSo I might have a 192.168.0 and\na 192.168.1 location that I can\n\n205\n00:10:17.043 --> 00:10:20.342\njust flip to really quickly and\nnow I'm on that IP range,\n\n206\n00:10:20.342 --> 00:10:24.770\nI can configure this new device, and\nthen I can flip back to my work one.\n\n207\n00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.497\nSo several different uses for this,\n\n208\n00:10:26.497 --> 00:10:30.467\nbut the cool thing is that it just doesn't\noverwrite your original configuration.\n\n209\n00:10:30.467 --> 00:10:33.894\nIt saves it and you can flip back and\nforth super easy.\n\n210\n00:10:33.894 --> 00:10:36.319\n&gt;&gt; Do VPNs count as a location?\n\n211\n00:10:36.319 --> 00:10:38.657\n&gt;&gt; You would think they do, but\n\n212\n00:10:38.657 --> 00:10:40.070\nthey don't.\n\n213\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:44.920\nSo with a VPN, I might be at home,\nI might be at a hotel, and I VPN,\n\n214\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:50.780\nI create a Virtual Private Network,\na tunnel that connects me up to my office.\n\n215\n00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.980\nAnd as soon as I'm connected,\nmy laptop thinks that I'm at the office.\n\n216\n00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.250\nOr if I VPN to my house,\nthen it thinks I'm at my house, right?\n\n217\n00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.610\nThat's how VPNs work.\n\n218\n00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.480\nSo you'd think it was a location but\nit's not.\n\n219\n00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.260\nIt's actually treated\nas a network adapter.\n\n220\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.190\nNow as a network adapter it can\nbe part of a location, right?\n\n221\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:13.340\nSo if I'm at work, for example, and I'll\ngo back into my System Preferences here.\n\n222\n00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.260\nIf I'm at work then it\ndoesn't make sense for\n\n223\n00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.500\nme to need to VPN into my work,\nright, cuz I'm already there.\n\n224\n00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.570\nBut if I'm at home,\nI might need to VPN into work.\n\n225\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.000\nWell, when I choose home, I see\na couple of networks over here, right?\n\n226\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.600\nI see my WiFi, Bluetooth, Thunderbolt.\n\n227\n00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.490\nBut I don't see any VPN information.\n\n228\n00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:40.190\nIf I hit the plus sign down at the bottom,\nI can add in a network and\n\n229\n00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.530\nI'll see the VPN option right there.\n\n230\n00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.440\nAnd so I can add it in and\nnow the configuration for\n\n231\n00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.453\nthat VPN becomes part of a location,\nbut the VPN isn't a location itself.\n\n232\n00:11:50.453 --> 00:11:54.570\nAnd that's a little confusing because\nyou'll usually think of it like hey,\n\n233\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.310\nit's a VPN, that's a separate network.\n\n234\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.440\nBut it really isn't, it's a gateway to\nconnect to a network that already exists.\n\n235\n00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.860\nSo the VPN will be part of\nmy home configuration or\n\n236\n00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.340\npart of my work configuration but allow\nme to connect to a different network.\n\n237\n00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.541\nNow, when you work with a VPN,\n\n238\n00:12:11.541 --> 00:12:16.915\nit's not something that an end user's\nnormally gonna set up themselves.\n\n239\n00:12:16.915 --> 00:12:18.910\nThey're usually gonna have a network\nengineer that's gonna give them\n\n240\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.013\nconfiguration settings or whatever.\n\n241\n00:12:20.013 --> 00:12:23.045\nBut as a support professional,\nyou might have to configure it.\n\n242\n00:12:23.045 --> 00:12:26.483\nThe key thing here to remember is\nif you're not using locations,\n\n243\n00:12:26.483 --> 00:12:31.190\nyou're just going to be under automatic\nand you'll add your VPN right there.\n\n244\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.470\nBut if you are using locations,\n\n245\n00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:37.420\nyou've got to think about where\nsomebody's going to use the VPN from.\n\n246\n00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.348\nIf they're at work, they're not gonna use\nthe VPN from work to connect to work,\n\n247\n00:12:40.348 --> 00:12:41.822\nthey're already there.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n248\n00:12:41.822 --> 00:12:42.983\n&gt;&gt; If they're at a hotel,\n\n249\n00:12:42.983 --> 00:12:44.439\nthey are going to use the VPN.\n\n250\n00:12:44.439 --> 00:12:46.189\nIf they're at home,\nthey are gonna use the VPN,\n\n251\n00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:48.078\nthat's where that connection\nneeds to be created.\n\n252\n00:12:48.078 --> 00:12:51.246\nSo just remember to create it in the right\nplace so it'll actually be useful for\n\n253\n00:12:51.246 --> 00:12:53.436\nyour users\n&gt;&gt; So if they are in the location,\n\n254\n00:12:53.436 --> 00:12:56.320\nhow do we configure them?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when I configure one,\n\n255\n00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.384\nI sort of started it just by hitting\nthe little plus sign there but\n\n256\n00:12:59.384 --> 00:13:01.390\nthat's kind of cheating, right?\n\n257\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.476\nIf you wanna configure a VPN,\n\n258\n00:13:02.476 --> 00:13:04.900\nthe first thing you need to do\nis get into the right location.\n\n259\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.270\nSo I'm gonna say when I'm,\nI've got Home and Hotel here.\n\n260\n00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.413\nI probably wouldn't do\nmultiple locations for that.\n\n261\n00:13:11.413 --> 00:13:15.510\nI would probably just say Work and\nTravel, right?\n\n262\n00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.660\nAnd when I'm at home,\nthat would be considered traveling,\n\n263\n00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.520\nI'm on some other network.\n\n264\n00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.801\nSo maybe I'll blow that configuration\naway and I'll rename Hotel and\n\n265\n00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:24.087\nI'll just call it Travel.\n\n266\n00:13:25.866 --> 00:13:31.350\nAll right, so now I've got Travel and\nWork, those are my two locations.\n\n267\n00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.998\nAnd so under Travel, I'm gonna come in and\nadd a new network adapter.\n\n268\n00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:39.150\nAnd the adaptor I'm gonna\nadd is a VPN adaptor.\n\n269\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:45.160\nWhen you choose VPN, the configuration for\nVPN is actually pretty hard.\n\n270\n00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.210\nWhoever set up the server,\n\n271\n00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:51.480\nthey've got a lot of choices they can\nmake and there's no one set standard.\n\n272\n00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.070\nI can't tell you, 99% of the time\nthese are gonna be the settings.\n\n273\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.982\nBecause it's up to\nwhoever set up your VPN.\n\n274\n00:13:56.982 --> 00:14:00.140\nIf you're the one who set it up,\nyou should know all this information.\n\n275\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.730\nSo, for example,\nthere are numerous types of VPNs, and\n\n276\n00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.240\nyou'll see that here on the list.\n\n277\n00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.388\nWhen I choose VPN,\nit immediately asks for a VPN type.\n\n278\n00:14:08.388 --> 00:14:12.066\nAnd I've got three different options here,\n\n279\n00:14:12.066 --> 00:14:16.920\nL2TP over IPsec, CISCO IPsec and\nIKEv2, all right?\n\n280\n00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.390\nEach one of these are related.\n\n281\n00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.760\nActually all three of\nthese are using IPsec.\n\n282\n00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.580\nIPsec stands for\nInternet Protocol Security.\n\n283\n00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.530\nAnd it's a way of encrypting our\nIP traffic across the network.\n\n284\n00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.083\nBut there's different\nimplementations of it.\n\n285\n00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:36.500\nThe first one, L2TP, that's layer\n2 tunneling protocol over IPSec.\n\n286\n00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.030\nLayer 2 tunneling protocol was originally\ndeveloped for Microsoft environments.\n\n287\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:45.199\nSo if I'm connecting into\na Microsoft VPN server, I'll use L2TP.\n\n288\n00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:47.992\nNow there's a lot of third\nparties that support L2TP also,\n\n289\n00:14:47.992 --> 00:14:49.590\nit's not just Microsoft.\n\n290\n00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.580\nBut most of them have moved away from\nit because L2TP is kind of cloggy.\n\n291\n00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:00.430\nCisco is the market leader for networking\ntechnologies that are out there.\n\n292\n00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.080\nThey have their own\nimplementation of IPsec, and so\n\n293\n00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.740\nCisco IPsec is an option right here.\n\n294\n00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:10.376\nTechnically that would be IKE version\none when you chose Cisco IPsec.\n\n295\n00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:14.030\nAnd if I choose L2TP, see it's not\nreally asking me any questions,\n\n296\n00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.928\nif I chose Cisco IPSec it's\nnot asking any questions,\n\n297\n00:15:16.928 --> 00:15:21.860\nit's gonna ask questions in a moment\nas far as how I need to configure that.\n\n298\n00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.950\nThe third option though I will tell\nyou is the most common today, and\n\n299\n00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.010\nthat's because it's IKEv2,\nit's the strongest of the three.\n\n300\n00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.457\nIKE stands for Internetwork Key Exchange.\n\n301\n00:15:31.457 --> 00:15:36.220\nAnd with Internetwork Key Exchange\nyou connect to a VPN server and\n\n302\n00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:40.740\nthe VPN server can communicate to you,\nhey, we need a key strength of this size.\n\n303\n00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.093\nYou gotta have this password, you gotta\nhave this other hashing algorithm,\n\n304\n00:15:44.093 --> 00:15:47.306\nthese are all the thing you've gotta\nhave to meet our security policies.\n\n305\n00:15:47.306 --> 00:15:49.862\nIKE is all about defining a policy.\n\n306\n00:15:49.862 --> 00:15:53.526\nSo that process is the most\npowerful with IKEv2, so\n\n307\n00:15:53.526 --> 00:15:56.623\nthat's the one you're gonna see the most.\n\n308\n00:15:56.623 --> 00:16:01.610\nBut the other two are still perfectly\nviable, you'll see them out there.\n\n309\n00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.690\nThere's others,\n\n310\n00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.200\nlike you might hear people talk about\nPPTP, point to point tunneling protocol.\n\n311\n00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.180\nPPTP is probably the most compatible,\n\n312\n00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.860\nit works with the most\nsystems that are out there.\n\n313\n00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.206\nBut now that I've said that,\nif it's the most compatible,\n\n314\n00:16:15.206 --> 00:16:16.264\nwhy isn't it in this list?\n\n315\n00:16:16.264 --> 00:16:21.180\nThat's because PPTP uses weak encryption\nand it's been shown that it can be broken.\n\n316\n00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.190\nYou don't wanna use a protocol\nthat's not safe, so\n\n317\n00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.810\nApple doesn't even put it in the list.\n\n318\n00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.580\nIf you wanna do PPTP,\nyou gotta drop to the command line and\n\n319\n00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.890\nactually get it set up or\nuse a third party client,\n\n320\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.770\nwhich is just not recommended.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n321\n00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.764\n&gt;&gt; So, I could use IKEv2, and\n\n322\n00:16:33.764 --> 00:16:37.920\nwhen I choose Create,\nit's gonna build that adapter, and\n\n323\n00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.085\nsee how it has that little padlock on it.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n324\n00:16:41.085 --> 00:16:42.331\n&gt;&gt; Letting me know it's not\n\n325\n00:16:42.331 --> 00:16:45.654\na real adapter, it's a virtual adapter,\nand now it's asking for\n\n326\n00:16:45.654 --> 00:16:47.720\nthe configuration settings.\n\n327\n00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.530\nAt a minimum,\nI need a server to connect to, and\n\n328\n00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.770\nthen I need a remote ID and a local ID.\n\n329\n00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:55.290\nIt's gonna complain about\nthat server address.\n\n330\n00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:00.340\nSo let's say that I come in here and\nI'll just make something up.\n\n331\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:06.473\nLet's say I'm connecting to\nvpn.itprotv.local, right, and\n\n332\n00:17:06.473 --> 00:17:09.923\nI need a remote ID,\nwhich a lot of times these remote and\n\n333\n00:17:09.923 --> 00:17:12.488\nlocal IDs will be IP addresses, right?\n\n334\n00:17:12.488 --> 00:17:14.298\nWhat is the IP range\nof the remote network,\n\n335\n00:17:14.298 --> 00:17:17.540\nwhat is the IP range of my local network,\nso I've gotta know that.\n\n336\n00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.290\nOr potentially it's just an identifier,\n\n337\n00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:25.430\na string that identifies you, so it might\neven be for example like a username.\n\n338\n00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.560\nWhat's the username of the server\nthat I'm connecting to, or\n\n339\n00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.630\nthe username that I'm using?\n\n340\n00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:35.720\nSo, I might have the vpnserver,\nvpnuser, this depends.\n\n341\n00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.250\nAnd again, I can't tell you, it's gonna be\nan IP address, it's gonna be a username,\n\n342\n00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.100\nbecause I don't know how\nyour system is set up.\n\n343\n00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.080\nAnd it's gonna be really\ndetermined on your end.\n\n344\n00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.710\nOnce those are set though, you can go to\nauthentication settings and here you can\n\n345\n00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.848\ndefine the actual username and password\nthat the user is going to make use of.\n\n346\n00:17:51.848 --> 00:17:54.916\nOr if they're doing certificate\nbased authentication, and\n\n347\n00:17:54.916 --> 00:17:56.595\nyou could pick the certificate.\n\n348\n00:17:56.595 --> 00:17:58.280\nThat's the strongest form but\n\n349\n00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.760\nit requires issuing certs to all of\nyour users which some people don't like.\n\n350\n00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.490\nSo you might choose to go username and\npassword, so\n\n351\n00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:09.360\nI can punch that in, and get that defined.\n\n352\n00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.270\nAll right, once you've got all that set,\nnow you've got a VPN.\n\n353\n00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:18.480\nAnd to connect to the VPN, you could come\nin here, you'll go to system preferences,\n\n354\n00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.490\nnetwork, choose the location,\nchoose the VPN, and hit Connect.\n\n355\n00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.030\nBut that's a lot of steps to go through,\nso normally,\n\n356\n00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:30.280\nwe'll choose to show the VPN option in\nthe menu bar, I'm gonna turn that on.\n\n357\n00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.140\nAnd the VPN icon, I'm not exactly\nsure what that is supposed to be,\n\n358\n00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.482\nthis little box with bunch of lines in it,\nnut once it's-\n\n359\n00:18:37.482 --> 00:18:39.780\n&gt;&gt; It's a toaster pastry.\n\n360\n00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.444\n&gt;&gt; I can see that.\n\n361\n00:18:40.444 --> 00:18:41.111\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:18:41.111 --> 00:18:42.000\n&gt;&gt; It's like a Pop-Tart.\n\n363\n00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.914\nAll right, so we've got the highly\nsecure Pop-Tart up here.\n\n364\n00:18:44.914 --> 00:18:50.630\n[LAUGH] And you were doing it the right\nway and not violating a trademark.\n\n365\n00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.970\nI'm throwing caution to the wind.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n366\n00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.081\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH]\n\n367\n00:18:53.081 --> 00:18:54.270\n&gt;&gt; Keep it generic.\n\n368\n00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.210\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna click on the VPN toaster\n\n369\n00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.490\npastry and what you'll find is,\n\n370\n00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.870\nwell mine is saying VPN is not configured\ncuz I haven't saved yet, right?\n\n371\n00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.594\nSo let me come down here and hit Apply,\nthis whole thing makes more sense when you\n\n372\n00:19:04.594 --> 00:19:05.218\nhit Apply.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n373\n00:19:05.218 --> 00:19:07.929\nthat would work.\n&gt;&gt; And then when I come up top,\n\n374\n00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:12.546\nI can hit the toaster pastry and\nnow I can see connect VPN (IKEv2),\n\n375\n00:19:12.546 --> 00:19:14.545\nright, and I can connect up.\n\n376\n00:19:14.545 --> 00:19:17.040\nI can show the time connected and so on.\n\n377\n00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.100\nThat's gonna show up right\nhere on my menu bar,\n\n378\n00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.410\nthanks to the VPN being defined down here.\n\n379\n00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.410\nNow, if you just have\none configuration and\n\n380\n00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.100\none VPN, then it doesn't\nmake sense to use location.\n\n381\n00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.660\nYou just leave it automatic, and\nhave this VPN option show up in the bar.\n\n382\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.689\nBut if you've got multiple VPNs that you\nuse, then this becomes really handy.\n\n383\n00:19:34.689 --> 00:19:38.780\nBecause you can click on this,\nyou can choose the different ones,\n\n384\n00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:43.178\nyou can hide certain VPNs depending\non which location that you're in.\n\n385\n00:19:43.178 --> 00:19:46.780\nYou get a lot more control over\nthat all tucked away in here.\n\n386\n00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.490\nNow I left mine called IKEv2\nwhich I'm never gonna remember.\n\n387\n00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:55.010\nSo you can highlight that VPN and if you\nclick the little gear at the bottom,\n\n388\n00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.620\nyou'll see where you\ncan rename the service.\n\n389\n00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:02.160\nAnd so\nI might call this the ITProTV Studios VPN,\n\n390\n00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.184\ncan't believe I misspelled VPN, twice.\n\n391\n00:20:06.184 --> 00:20:08.310\nSo I'm gonna rename that so\nI can remember it.\n\n392\n00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.960\nThat's a little more handy because now\nwhen I come up here to the menu bar and\n\n393\n00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.780\nI drop that down, shoot,\nI haven't applied.\n\n394\n00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.340\nGotta remember to hit Apply,\nbut once we've done that,\n\n395\n00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:22.000\nI can go to the menu bar and\nnow it says Connect ITProTV Studios VPN.\n\n396\n00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:29.430\nIt's a lot more intuitive than Connect\nIKEv2, which an end user isn't gonna know.\n\n397\n00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.810\nSo those are a few little\ntweaks that we can do.\n\n398\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:38.510\nNow I've been showing you this using the\nbuilt in networking functionality, right?\n\n399\n00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.450\nAnd on the exam,\nthat's what you're going to see, but\n\n400\n00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.380\nlet me give you a little\nreal world piece of advice.\n\n401\n00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.210\nThe built-in VPN client\nhere is fairly inflexible.\n\n402\n00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.020\nApple built it up really\nto work with their\n\n403\n00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.240\nVPN solution as part of the Server app.\n\n404\n00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.630\nApple has announced that\nthey're ending support for\n\n405\n00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.010\nthat in the next version\nof the Server app.\n\n406\n00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.278\nSo if you're running\nmacOS 10.3 High Sierra,\n\n407\n00:21:00.278 --> 00:21:05.520\nand you've got the server I've deployed,\nyou can use that VPN right now.\n\n408\n00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.683\nBut if you just watch this show and said,\nwait, I can do a VPN, don't do Apple.\n\n409\n00:21:10.683 --> 00:21:13.934\nIf this is a new deployment don't do Apple\ncuz this is the last version that's gonna\n\n410\n00:21:13.934 --> 00:21:14.454\nsupport it.\n\n411\n00:21:14.454 --> 00:21:18.136\nSo when 10.14 comes out and\nreally to be Server app 6,\n\n412\n00:21:18.136 --> 00:21:23.500\nI guess, or whatever comes after 5.5,\nthey are gonna kill off the VPN.\n\n413\n00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:28.430\nAnd that's gonna make it where it's not so\nconvenient to use this VPN client anymore.\n\n414\n00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:31.610\nI guess, if you're connecting\nwith Cisco VPN or whatever, so\n\n415\n00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.900\nthere are plenty of third party\nclients that are out there.\n\n416\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.869\nNow on the ACSP exam, it's just this one,\n\n417\n00:21:36.869 --> 00:21:39.650\nthey're not gonna hit you\non any third party stuff.\n\n418\n00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.001\nBut in the real world,\nthere's plenty of thirdparty ones,\n\n419\n00:21:42.001 --> 00:21:45.340\nI actually use one called Viscosity,\nthat's this little red circle up here.\n\n420\n00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.760\nAnd you'll see where I actually\nhave the ITProTV Studios-\n\n421\n00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.880\n&gt;&gt; Hey there you go!\n\n422\n00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.388\n&gt;&gt; As a VPN,\n\n423\n00:21:49.388 --> 00:21:51.310\nthe Viscosity client is a good one.\n\n424\n00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.470\nCisco has the Cisco AnyConnect client\nthat you can run on top of MacOS.\n\n425\n00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.790\nAnd there's tons of third party\nones that are out there as well.\n\n426\n00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.540\nSo don't hesitate to reach out and\n\n427\n00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.950\ncheck out third party ones because\na lot of them are really good, and\n\n428\n00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.190\nthey're gonna continue to be\nsupported beyond this last version.\n\n429\n00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:11.620\nAfter High Sierra,\nApple will still support the client, but\n\n430\n00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.840\nnot the server, and on the client side,\nit just doesn't have a ton of options,\n\n431\n00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.200\nit doesn't have a ton of features.\n\n432\n00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.920\nAt no point in this configuration\nwas I able to hard set\n\n433\n00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.390\na minimum encryption protocol.\n\n434\n00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.130\nSo all of these are working profile based,\n\n435\n00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.512\nwhen I connect to the server I'm expecting\nthe server to tell me what profile to use.\n\n436\n00:22:28.512 --> 00:22:31.412\nWell if the server tells me\nto use something weak, right?\n\n437\n00:22:31.412 --> 00:22:34.254\nSomebody's pulling a man\nin the middle attack and\n\n438\n00:22:34.254 --> 00:22:39.070\nthey send a message saying, yeah we\nneed you to use DES encryption, right?\n\n439\n00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:44.440\nWell DES takes like three seconds\nto break and it's just trivial.\n\n440\n00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.140\nBut my system might say, okay,\nI'll do what you told me, right?\n\n441\n00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.821\nThat's the kind of risk that we have, and\n\n442\n00:22:49.821 --> 00:22:52.961\nthird party clients will usually let you\nhard set what that minimum level is.\n\n443\n00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:58.221\nLike I will connect unless I can\nget AES 128 or higher, right?\n\n444\n00:22:58.221 --> 00:23:02.700\nThis is something like that that ensures\nyour minimum level of protection.\n\n445\n00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.940\nThat's already being done server side, but\nif somebody doesn't a man in the middle of\n\n446\n00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.160\nthe tech,\nyou might not be hitting the server.\n\n447\n00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.500\nYou might be hitting something in between,\n\n448\n00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.410\nand it's nice to have the client\nto participate in that.\n\n449\n00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:15.830\nSo in a high security environment, Apple's\nVPN client is not really the most robust.\n\n450\n00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.560\n&gt;&gt; Another excellent episode,\n\n451\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.270\nadvanced network configuration, loved it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n452\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:22.200\n&gt;&gt; Don, before we move on,\n\n453\n00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.970\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; The key thing here for\n\n454\n00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:29.450\nus as support professionals, we learn\nabout locations, we remember them,\n\n455\n00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.480\nbut end users, they don't know about them.\n\n456\n00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.300\nAnd so when you first roll\nout locations like this,\n\n457\n00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.670\nyou're gonna get support desk calls.\n\n458\n00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:40.170\nYou're gonna get people calling in saying,\nhey I'm at home and\n\n459\n00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:41.600\nmy network's not working.\n\n460\n00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.070\nAnd it's because they still have\na static configuration from work,\n\n461\n00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.510\nthey haven't changed the locations.\n\n462\n00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:48.168\nSo you're gonna have to educate your\nusers on how to use these locations,\n\n463\n00:23:48.168 --> 00:23:49.750\nhow to know to flip between them.\n\n464\n00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:53.450\nIf you don't educate your users,\nthe Mac doesn't know how to switch.\n\n465\n00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.150\nIt doesn't know when you're at home or\nwhen you're at work,\n\n466\n00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:57.420\nit doesn't have that information.\n\n467\n00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.990\nSo the end users have to get involved with\nthat, you're going to have to put together\n\n468\n00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.440\nat least a little bit of training\nto make sure everybody is aware.\n\n469\n00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.590\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Don, and listen,\n\n470\n00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:07.790\nmake sure you watch every single

00:00:08.565\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:13.303\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.303 --> 00:00:16.990\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.390\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.370\nAs we continue on with\nApple Certified Support professional.\n\n8\n00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.107\nSharing resources is the title of this\nepisode and once again we've begged,\n\n9\n00:00:25.107 --> 00:00:28.957\nwe've pleaded and we've brought him in,\nDon Pezet is gonna help us out, Don,\n\n10\n00:00:28.957 --> 00:00:31.353\ngood to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Hey glad to be back Zach and\n\n11\n00:00:31.353 --> 00:00:34.943\nin this episode we're gonna be\ntalking about sharing resources.\n\n12\n00:00:34.943 --> 00:00:41.430\nSo if you only have one computer, this is\ngonna be a very lonely episode for you.\n\n13\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.220\nBecause what we are talking about is if\nwe have two or more computers and we have\n\n14\n00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.090\ninformation and data that we wanna share\nand exchange between them, this is it.\n\n15\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.000\nIt's our special Valentine's Day episode\nof sharing resources with Mac OS.\n\n16\n00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.710\nBut all of that coming up\nright here in this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.580\n&gt;&gt; What's the most popular\n\n18\n00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.690\nthing to share on a network?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n19\n00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.360\nthere's really two main things.\n\n20\n00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.930\nWe're gonna talk about like seven or\neight different things that we can share.\n\n21\n00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.740\nBut there's two main things\nthat if I just walk up to\n\n22\n00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.070\na system administrator out of the blue and\nsay, I need to share something,\n\n23\n00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.970\nthey are usually gonna think\nabout files and printers.\n\n24\n00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.580\nAnd we've talked a little bit\nabout each in other episodes, but\n\n25\n00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.550\nlet's recap those just to make\nsure we're thorough here.\n\n26\n00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.320\nWhen it comes to sharing printers and\nfiles, it is super easy.\n\n27\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.250\nIt's really easy to do that right inside\nof any Mac and get another Mac connected.\n\n28\n00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.250\nSo to do that,\nlike right here on my Mac, I've got,\n\n29\n00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.520\nthis is a fresh install\nof Mac OS High Sierra.\n\n30\n00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.107\nBut I'll tell you, These steps have\nnot changed in a long, long time so\n\n31\n00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:44.429\nthis is pretty much how it was back in,\nwell really when OS 10 first came out.\n\n32\n00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.002\nSo it hasn't changed much.\n\n33\n00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:49.279\nBasically you're gonna go\ninto your system preferences.\n\n34\n00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:53.603\nAnd inside of your system preferences\nyou'll find a preference in here called\n\n35\n00:01:53.603 --> 00:01:54.193\nsharing.\n\n36\n00:01:54.193 --> 00:01:56.840\nAnd so this is it right here, sharing.\n\n37\n00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.560\nAnd when I go into sharing, I'll see all\nthe different things that I can share out.\n\n38\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.260\nSome might be turned on,\nsome might be turned off, but\n\n39\n00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.270\nif I want to do printer and file sharing,\nthey're right in the middle.\n\n40\n00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.930\nWith file sharing, I check the box\nto turn it on, and that says hey,\n\n41\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.980\nI want to share files on my network.\n\n42\n00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.140\nAnd then I need to tell it\nwhat I'm going to share.\n\n43\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.680\nBy default your public\nfolder will get shared.\n\n44\n00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.780\nAnd if you look at the permissions\nyou'll see you have read and\n\n45\n00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.950\nwrite access, everybody else has read.\n\n46\n00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.970\nSo if I just wanna give somebody\nelse access to a file on the network\n\n47\n00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.040\nI can throw it right in my public\nfolder and I'm in business.\n\n48\n00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.830\nBut let's say that I had\nsome kind of special folder,\n\n49\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.280\na folder that I wanted to grant\nthe whole company access to.\n\n50\n00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.870\nIt's gonna be my corporate documents,\nright.\n\n51\n00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.980\nSo I could go into my finder,\ngo into my documents.\n\n52\n00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.680\nI can whip up a new folder in here,\nwhich I'll call my Corporate Documents.\n\n53\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.710\nAnd so, now I've got that folder,\nand I wanna share this out,\n\n54\n00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.580\nwhere anybody can come in here.\n\n55\n00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.717\nSo maybe I have a, oops, shoot,\nI was going to do a quick note.\n\n56\n00:03:01.717 --> 00:03:05.443\nI meant to do a text, not a note\nwhich I clicked on the wrong icon.\n\n57\n00:03:05.443 --> 00:03:09.940\nSo let me just whip up a quick text\nfile here and so this is a file.\n\n58\n00:03:12.578 --> 00:03:18.230\nAnd I'm gonna save that into my newly\ncreated Corporate Documents folder, and\n\n59\n00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.830\nthis is gonna be our employee handbook,\nright?\n\n60\n00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.560\nI want people to be able to get to this,\nand maybe I want people to be able to even\n\n61\n00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.100\nedit and modify it to be able\nto work with that, right?\n\n62\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.690\nSo, once I've got that created,\nI come back here into file sharing, and\n\n63\n00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.110\nI can use the little plus sign\nright here to add in other things.\n\n64\n00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.860\nAnd see how it defaulted\nto my documents folder,\n\n65\n00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.690\nit jumped right there,\ncuz that's where I just was a moment ago.\n\n66\n00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.030\nAnd I can choose the Corporate Documents\nfolder, I can add that to my list.\n\n67\n00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.230\nNow Corporate Documents is right there,\nand I can adjust the permissions.\n\n68\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.660\nMaybe I want people on my staff\nto be able to Read &amp; Write,\n\n69\n00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.600\neverybody else gets Read Only, and\nnow I've got those permissions set.\n\n70\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.810\nNow I'm sharing this on the network,\nall I do is add it to the list and\n\n71\n00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.120\nset the permissions, it's pretty easy.\n\n72\n00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.410\nPrinters are basically the same way,\nif I go down to Printer Sharing,\n\n73\n00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.670\nI can check the box there\nto turn on printer sharing.\n\n74\n00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.520\nAnd then I'll see each of the printers\nthat I have here in my list.\n\n75\n00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.070\nAnd I can check the ones\nthat I want to print.\n\n76\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.980\nNow I forgot something, I checked\nthe box to turn on printer sharing,\n\n77\n00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.150\nbefore I had set any printers to\nbe shared, it doesn't like that.\n\n78\n00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.120\nOn the folder side that worked because\nI already had the public folder,\n\n79\n00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.690\nthe public folder was there by default.\n\n80\n00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.740\nBut on the printer side it\ndoesn't have a default like that.\n\n81\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.720\nSo that's why it kind of\nignored me checking that.\n\n82\n00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.980\nBut if I come over here and I check my lab\nprinter and I say, I wanna share out my\n\n83\n00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.180\nlab printer, now it knows, okay,\nI'm gonna be sharing out this resource.\n\n84\n00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.730\nAnd I can define what I want, maybe I\nwant my staff to be able to print and\n\n85\n00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.250\nthat's it.\n\n86\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.100\nSo I could come in, and could find that\ngroup, maybe it's administrators or\n\n87\n00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.490\nstaff or whatever that group happens to\nbe, and I can add that person in here.\n\n88\n00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.240\nAnd they'll have permission to print and\n\n89\n00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.840\nthen I can take everyone and\nset them a new access or\n\n90\n00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.030\ngive them some other kind of permission\nright here, pretty straightforward.\n\n91\n00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.630\nOnce that's done, see how printer\nsharing over here checked itself.\n\n92\n00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.490\nI didn't have to do that\nit was just waiting for\n\n93\n00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.620\nme to have one printer that was shared.\n\n94\n00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.319\nSo at this point I'm now sharing those\ntwo resources, that was really easy.\n\n95\n00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:25.778\nThat if I jump over to another Mac,\nso this is my this is my Mac here,\n\n96\n00:05:25.778 --> 00:05:29.383\nso if I take my Mac, and\nI go into my finder and\n\n97\n00:05:29.383 --> 00:05:33.884\nI start looking on the left\nside here I've got shared.\n\n98\n00:05:33.884 --> 00:05:38.066\nAnd under Shared is where I'm gonna see\nall the Macs that are on the network, and\n\n99\n00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:40.790\nwe've got quite a few\nfloating around here.\n\n100\n00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:47.040\nSo as I look at this list, here it is,\nDon's Lab Mac, right there, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.990\nIt just showed up on the network,\n\n102\n00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.200\nit's got a big question mark on it\nbecause it's a virtual machine.\n\n103\n00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.320\nNormally it'll identify and\n\n104\n00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.040\nit'll say, it's a Mac Mini, like my\nPlex Server is a Mac Mini, so it shows up.\n\n105\n00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.251\nOr Don's MacMini.\n\n106\n00:05:57.251 --> 00:05:59.174\nOddly enough, also a MacMini.\n\n107\n00:05:59.174 --> 00:06:00.597\nSo it shows it that way.\n\n108\n00:06:00.597 --> 00:06:04.730\nThe editing stations are Imax and so\nthey show up with the write icon.\n\n109\n00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.225\nThat's why this one has a question mark.\n\n110\n00:06:07.225 --> 00:06:09.434\nLike there's a MacBook over there.\n\n111\n00:06:09.434 --> 00:06:14.064\nIf I take Don's Lab Mac and I double click\non it, it's gonna browse into it and\n\n112\n00:06:14.064 --> 00:06:15.917\nsee how it says not connected?\n\n113\n00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:20.370\nI'm not connected because,\nwell, it tried to connect but\n\n114\n00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.890\nI haven't given it a username and\na password, I haven't authenticated yet.\n\n115\n00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.110\nSo up here, I need to hit Connect As and\nI can say who I'm connecting as.\n\n116\n00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.490\nEither as a guest, so\n\n117\n00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.530\nI would have basically anonymous access,\nor a registered, or an Apple ID.\n\n118\n00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.625\nSo I do have a user\naccount on that system, so\n\n119\n00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:38.393\nI'll punch in my user information.\n\n120\n00:06:38.393 --> 00:06:43.049\nI'll connect and now I see,\nDon Pezet's Public Folder.\n\n121\n00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:46.796\nAnd because I logged in as me,\nI see my home folder as well,\n\n122\n00:06:46.796 --> 00:06:50.771\nbut I see Corporate Documents right there,\nI can browse in and\n\n123\n00:06:50.771 --> 00:06:53.005\nthere's the Employee Handbook.\n\n124\n00:06:53.005 --> 00:06:56.116\nSo I'm able to see that, and\nconnect to it, work with it,\n\n125\n00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:58.150\ndo whatever it is that I need.\n\n126\n00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.710\nAnd once I'm connected to there,\nit's really the same basic process,\n\n127\n00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.520\nwell I guess a little bit different for\nprinters, right?\n\n128\n00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.710\nI don't see the printers\nhere in the finder.\n\n129\n00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.560\nWhen I connected to my lab machine\nthe printer didn't show up, but\n\n130\n00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.150\nif I go into my System Preferences,\nand I go into Printers &amp; Scanners.\n\n131\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.710\nOnce I'm inside of Printers and Scanners,\nI can choose to add a printer, and\n\n132\n00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.610\nit's gonna start scanning for\nnearby systems.\n\n133\n00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.800\nAnd it's gonna look to find\na printer to add it in.\n\n134\n00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.340\nNow the printer that I shared for my lab\nmachine is actually the same one that I'm\n\n135\n00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.910\ndirectly connected to here, so\nthat's why it's now showing up.\n\n136\n00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.730\nI would have to like manually come in and\nadd it if I wanted it to show up.\n\n137\n00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.824\nBut if I go through and do this I can\nhunt it down, punch in the IP machine,\n\n138\n00:07:40.824 --> 00:07:43.420\nor whatever it is that I need to do\nto be able to connect to it, and\n\n139\n00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.330\nwe would see it that way.\n\n140\n00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.011\nSo we add printers a little bit different.\n\n141\n00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:50.232\nBut as far as sharing them out, it's\nreally just a matter of popping in here\n\n142\n00:07:50.232 --> 00:07:54.930\nand telling it inside of our sharing panel\nthat we wanna share those two things out.\n\n143\n00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.708\nSo those are the two most common\nthings that we are going to share.\n\n144\n00:07:58.708 --> 00:08:02.863\nAnd they're pretty easy.\n&gt;&gt; Don are there other ways we can share\n\n145\n00:08:02.863 --> 00:08:05.760\nfile based documents and so forth?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n146\n00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.515\nso what I did here,\nthis is considered like the easy button.\n\n147\n00:08:09.515 --> 00:08:10.900\nRight, you just turn it on and\n\n148\n00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.700\nyou go, you don't actually see\na lot of the nitty gritty details.\n\n149\n00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.790\nBut there's actually a lot more\nkind of behind the scenes.\n\n150\n00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.740\nSo for example if I go to file sharing,\nthere's this Options button.\n\n151\n00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.180\nAnd if you go into Options,\n\n152\n00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.900\nyou'll see where there's two different\nprotocols that could be used.\n\n153\n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.960\nWe could use SMB,\n\n154\n00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.430\nwhich is Server Message Block, or\nAFP, which is Apple File Protocol.\n\n155\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.510\nAnd you would think,\nwith this being a Mac,\n\n156\n00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.060\nthat it would have defaulted to\nApple File Protocol, but it didn't, right?\n\n157\n00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.700\nIt defaults to SMB, and the reason there\nis SMB is actually a Microsoft protocol,\n\n158\n00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.550\nand it's used by Microsoft Windows.\n\n159\n00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:47.019\nWell when you share documents\nthat's usually a business activity,\n\n160\n00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:48.889\nhome users don't normally do that.\n\n161\n00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:50.940\nYou can, but they don't need to.\n\n162\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.640\nSo in the business world,\npeople use this all the time, and\n\n163\n00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.520\nso Apple's trying to make it\nthe most compatible with business.\n\n164\n00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.080\nAnd so\nthat's why SMB is turned on by default.\n\n165\n00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.379\nAnd I can see that when I connected a\nmoment ago, the number of connected users\n\n166\n00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:08.570\nis one, that was me connecting and\nI connected with SMB.\n\n167\n00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:13.038\nBut I could turn on AFP and\nnow Apple File Protocol's fired up and\n\n168\n00:09:13.038 --> 00:09:15.370\nit will start to get used as well.\n\n169\n00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.224\nAnd so now when somebody connects to\nmy machine, see the little note here.\n\n170\n00:09:19.224 --> 00:09:21.900\nThey can connect with AFP Or SMB,\n\n171\n00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:27.000\nthey can connect with either one and\naccess that file, or folder, or document.\n\n172\n00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.824\nThere's actually several different\nprotocols that are available in\n\n173\n00:09:31.824 --> 00:09:33.136\nthe background like that.\n\n174\n00:09:33.136 --> 00:09:35.300\nSome of them show up here, some don't.\n\n175\n00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.870\nSo for example,\nthere's this remote login, right?\n\n176\n00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.674\nRemote login is really designed\nto enable SSH, the secure shell.\n\n177\n00:09:43.674 --> 00:09:47.860\nIt allows somebody over the network to\nconnect and get a shell on this Mac.\n\n178\n00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.770\nBut when you turn on SSH,\nit also turns on SFTP,\n\n179\n00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.700\nthe Secure File Transfer Protocol.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n180\n00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.160\nAnd so somebody can use an SFTP client\nlike Cyberduck, or FileZilla, or\n\n181\n00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.130\nsomething like that.\n\n182\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.420\nAnd they could connect\nup to the system and\n\n183\n00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.550\ndo encrypted file transfers back and\nforth.\n\n184\n00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:10.790\nThat's not in using Apple file protocol or\nSMB, it's using SFTP,\n\n185\n00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.950\na completely separate protocol.\n\n186\n00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.331\nYou don't necessarily notice that option\nbecause it's tucked away under remote\n\n187\n00:10:16.331 --> 00:10:17.220\nlogin, right?\n\n188\n00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.910\nSo if you don't know how to go and\nlook for it then you might not see it.\n\n189\n00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.850\nBut if I turn that on,\nnow my system is up and\n\n190\n00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.620\nit's telling me I can connect\nby using SSH right here.\n\n191\n00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.860\nAnd it gives me that address,\n\n192\n00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:33.160\nthe SSH followed by your user name @\nfollowed by the IP address of the machine.\n\n193\n00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.010\nSo for example if I were to jump\nover here to my system, I could\n\n194\n00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.580\ncome in here, and I can run that line.\n\n195\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:49.680\nssh dpezet@10.0.13.128 and it's gonna ask\nme for my password, I can punch that in.\n\n196\n00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.380\nAnd now, I've got a shell in Don's-Lab-Mac\nso I can start working with it.\n\n197\n00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.654\nAnd SFTP, Secure File Transfer Protocol,\n\n198\n00:10:57.654 --> 00:11:02.522\nit's just sending the file\ninformation via that shell session.\n\n199\n00:11:02.522 --> 00:11:07.007\nSo you do need a third-party utility for\nit, I usually use Filezilla or\n\n200\n00:11:07.007 --> 00:11:10.993\nCyberduck, both which are free\nyou can go online and get them.\n\n201\n00:11:10.993 --> 00:11:14.773\nBut basically what this program does is\nit lets you see your local machine and\n\n202\n00:11:14.773 --> 00:11:18.370\nthen you can connect to a remote\nside over here remote machine.\n\n203\n00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:24.210\nSo if I wanna connect, let me come\nin here and get my site manager.\n\n204\n00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:31.283\nAnd so I'm going to add in a site,\nI'll do my Don's Lab Mac.\n\n205\n00:11:31.283 --> 00:11:35.974\nAnd I'm just gonna punch in that\ninformation that we saw a moment ago,\n\n206\n00:11:35.974 --> 00:11:41.570\nI'm going to tell it that I'm using SFTP,\nthe host was 10.0.13.128.\n\n207\n00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.260\nAnd I need to tell it that I'm\nlogging in with a normal user name,\n\n208\n00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:49.620\nI'll log in with dpezet and\nmy password, all right.\n\n209\n00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.170\nAnd once I get all that information\nplugged in I can connect and it's gonna\n\n210\n00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.300\nverify that encryption certificate,\nso I just have to accept that.\n\n211\n00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.988\nBut once it's done, I'm now browsing\nthe file system on that other machine.\n\n212\n00:12:00.988 --> 00:12:03.830\nI'm seeing /Users/dpezet, and\n\n213\n00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:07.740\nif I browse into documents,\nthere is the Corporate Documents.\n\n214\n00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.192\nIf I browse in there,\nthere is the Employee Handbook.\n\n215\n00:12:10.192 --> 00:12:14.710\nAnd so I can see and work with these\nfiles, I can copy them, duplicate them,\n\n216\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.910\nwhatever it is that I needed to do, and\neven upload more information into it.\n\n217\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.030\nIf I wanna send,\nhere I'll send this file over.\n\n218\n00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.460\nSo that's going to copy over, and\nit did it through an encrypted session so\n\n219\n00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.710\nit was very secure.\n\n220\n00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:30.150\nIf I jump back over to that machine\nI should be able to browse into that\n\n221\n00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:37.560\nCorporate Documents folder, and there's\nthat aws demo file that I copied over.\n\n222\n00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.148\nSo I don't have to use the SMB\nprotocol that's on by default,\n\n223\n00:12:41.148 --> 00:12:43.911\nthere's plenty of others\nthat I can pick from.\n\n224\n00:12:43.911 --> 00:12:46.049\nAnd there's even some really weird ones,\nright?\n\n225\n00:12:46.049 --> 00:12:50.918\nFor example-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Weird is good.\n\n226\n00:12:50.918 --> 00:12:53.460\n&gt;&gt; This guy right here, DVD or CD sharing.\n\n227\n00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.310\nOkay, most Mac's don't have a DVD or\n\n228\n00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.620\nCD drive anymore.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n229\n00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.660\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n230\n00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.800\nwhat if I have software that's\non a DVD and I need to use it?\n\n231\n00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.720\nI could go to a Mac that does have a CD or\n\n232\n00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.494\nDVD drive, Filezilla is just gonna keep\ngoing crazy in the background here,\n\n233\n00:13:07.494 --> 00:13:11.090\nlet me just cancel that so\nit leaves me alone, there you go.\n\n234\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.518\nSo I can go to a Mac that did\nhave a DVD or CD drive and\n\n235\n00:13:14.518 --> 00:13:16.545\nI could turn this option on.\n\n236\n00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:20.565\nAnd now other people on the network could\nconnect directly to my DVD or CD drive,\n\n237\n00:13:20.565 --> 00:13:22.725\nand act as if it was\nlocal on their machine.\n\n238\n00:13:22.725 --> 00:13:24.905\nThat's really handy if you have files or\n\n239\n00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:28.530\ncontent that's stored on optical\nmedia you still need access to.\n\n240\n00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.020\nThat's another type of file\nsharing that can happen.\n\n241\n00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.080\nMost of us don't need it,\nbut it is there and\n\n242\n00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.810\nit's available if we choose to turn it on.\n&gt;&gt; With all these options how do clients\n\n243\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.660\nknow which method to connect with?\n&gt;&gt; So it really boils down to\n\n244\n00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:46.100\nusing the right tool, using the right\ntool for what it is they're trying to do.\n\n245\n00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.620\nWhen we connect, I showed you for\nexample on my machine,\n\n246\n00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.520\nlet me terminate out of this program here.\n\n247\n00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.620\nI showed you on my machine where\nI went into the Finder, right?\n\n248\n00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:01.380\nAnd when I used the Finder I browsed\nthe network, I went to Don's Lab Mac,\n\n249\n00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.830\nI authenticated.\n\n250\n00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.339\nAnd once I had authenticated,\nI saw all these folders,\n\n251\n00:14:05.339 --> 00:14:10.020\nit never asked me about a protocol or\nanything like that.\n\n252\n00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.290\nIt just let me in, and that was that.\n\n253\n00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.250\nSo most of it's gonna be hidden from us.\n\n254\n00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.880\nIf you want manually specific a protocol,\nyou can.\n\n255\n00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.610\nIt's actually done through the Finder\nas well, the Finder will try and\n\n256\n00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.080\nguess, it will try and\nguess the best protocol to use.\n\n257\n00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.930\nBut if you ever wanna manually specify,\nyou can go up to your Go Menu.\n\n258\n00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:35.491\nAnd under Go you can come down here to\nthe bottom and choose Connect to Server.\n\n259\n00:14:35.491 --> 00:14:39.381\nAnd when you choose Connect to Server,\nyou can punch in a server address.\n\n260\n00:14:39.381 --> 00:14:43.780\nAnd when you punch in the server\naddress you can specify the protocol.\n\n261\n00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:51.111\nSo i could say smb://10.0.13.128 and\nnow I'm gonna connect with SMB.\n\n262\n00:14:51.111 --> 00:14:55.652\nOr if I want to force AFP the apple\nfile protocol I can do it that way and\n\n263\n00:14:55.652 --> 00:14:57.030\nI can connect.\n\n264\n00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.720\nAnd this way I'm telling it\nwhich method I want to use.\n\n265\n00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.780\nBut most of the time we don't need that,\nright?\n\n266\n00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:03.820\nWe just use the Finder,\n\n267\n00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.600\nwe're browse and connect, we let\nMac OS figure out what protocol it is.\n\n268\n00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.220\nBut if you ever a specific need to force\nit, you can do it from right here.\n\n269\n00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.545\nI just showed you AFP and SMB,\n\n270\n00:15:14.545 --> 00:15:20.564\nthere's actually several others you can\ndo from here, it supports FTP, not SFTP.\n\n271\n00:15:20.564 --> 00:15:21.975\nIt won't do secure it from here but\n\n272\n00:15:21.975 --> 00:15:24.470\na regular unencrypted file\ntransfer protocol, you can do.\n\n273\n00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.490\nThe Mac OS Server App used to\nhave an FTP server built into it.\n\n274\n00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.640\nThey've removed that since then, but\n\n275\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.110\nthe support from a client\nperspective is still there.\n\n276\n00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:40.070\nYou can do WebDAV connections, WebDAV is\nWeb Distributed Authoring and Versioning.\n\n277\n00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:43.455\nIt's not terribly popular anymore, but\nthere were a number of content management\n\n278\n00:15:43.455 --> 00:15:45.880\nsystems like Microsoft SharePoint\nthat used it.\n\n279\n00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.785\nAnd you can connect directly\nto that SharePoint server.\n\n280\n00:15:48.785 --> 00:15:53.762\nThey were weird because the address\nwould just be https:// whatever and\n\n281\n00:15:53.762 --> 00:15:57.475\nyou punch in and\nthey would connect to that web server and\n\n282\n00:15:57.475 --> 00:16:01.518\nyou're actually transmitting\nstuff Using web protocols.\n\n283\n00:16:01.518 --> 00:16:04.219\nAnother one that you might\nuse from time to time is NFS,\n\n284\n00:16:04.219 --> 00:16:05.936\nwhich is the network file system.\n\n285\n00:16:05.936 --> 00:16:09.580\nThat's actually the default\nsharing system found in Unix.\n\n286\n00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.223\nUnder the hood, macOS is running BSD Unix.\n\n287\n00:16:12.223 --> 00:16:16.509\nAnd so with that, it's going to reach\nout and connect to a Unix server.\n\n288\n00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:20.471\nAnd use a native Unix protocol to\nreally give that connectivity.\n\n289\n00:16:20.471 --> 00:16:25.580\nNow most Unix servers have switched over\nto SFTP as this point, as opposed to NFS.\n\n290\n00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:30.096\nBut NFS is still out there, and\nthe support is right into MacOS.\n\n291\n00:16:30.096 --> 00:16:34.983\nSo those are high level overview of\nthe different protocols that are available\n\n292\n00:16:34.983 --> 00:16:38.690\nif we want to manually specify them But,\ntypically\n\n293\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.921\nwe just let the finder do the work for us.\n&gt;&gt; How does Mac OS discover the shared\n\n294\n00:16:42.921 --> 00:16:45.188\nresources on the network though?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so,\n\n295\n00:16:45.188 --> 00:16:48.451\nin the finder when I browsed into it,\nit just saw all of those Macs.\n\n296\n00:16:48.451 --> 00:16:50.370\nIn fact,\nI wanted it to find my lab Mac but,\n\n297\n00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.170\nI found tons of other devices\nthat were on the network.\n\n298\n00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.660\nAnd when you look at it, it's kind of\nsurprising what it all finds here,\n\n299\n00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.160\nI'll jump back over to this Mac.\n\n300\n00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.200\nSo when it jumps out there and\n\n301\n00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.550\nit starts to browse around,\nit's finding tons of stuff.\n\n302\n00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.330\nAnd some of it is Apple related,\nlike my Mac Mini in my office.\n\n303\n00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:11.040\nSome of it is not even\nnecessarily a particular device,\n\n304\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.600\nlike here, Control for Home.\n\n305\n00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.420\nThat's a little automation\nsystem that we have.\n\n306\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.740\nOthers are servers, like here we\nhave some storage appliances, or\n\n307\n00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.100\nour little storage vault.\n\n308\n00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.580\nAnd some it finds with\nmore than one protocol.\n\n309\n00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:29.060\nSo for example, our STORAGE01 server,\nit's showing up as Apple File Protocol,\n\n310\n00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.100\nbut it's also showing up\nas a Time Machine server.\n\n311\n00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.630\nSo it's performing more than one role,\nand the system is finding this stuff.\n\n312\n00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.340\nNow the way it finds it is\nactually somewhat complex.\n\n313\n00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:45.190\nIt is finding it, well a lot of it is\nfound via a protocol called Bonjour.\n\n314\n00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:50.040\nBonjour is a Apple protocol that's used\nto discover devices on the network.\n\n315\n00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.937\n&gt;&gt; Bonjour.\n\n316\n00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:52.151\n&gt;&gt; It's a very chatty,\n\n317\n00:17:52.151 --> 00:17:54.182\nvery French protocol.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n318\n00:17:54.182 --> 00:17:55.742\n&gt;&gt; It communicates a lot on the network\n\n319\n00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:58.394\nto be able to find people, and\nit does a pretty good job of it.\n\n320\n00:17:58.394 --> 00:18:00.547\nIt worked great in home environments,\n\n321\n00:18:00.547 --> 00:18:03.229\nit works great in small\nbusiness environments.\n\n322\n00:18:03.229 --> 00:18:06.423\nIt doesn't work very great in\nlarge environments because Bonjour\n\n323\n00:18:06.423 --> 00:18:09.630\nis broadcast-based,\nwhich means it can't be routed.\n\n324\n00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.460\nSo if you have multiple networks,\nBonjour doesn't work so well,\n\n325\n00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.650\nyou'll only see people that\nare on the same network as you.\n\n326\n00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.890\nThere's other protocols that are in\nplay also, there's multi-cast DNS,\n\n327\n00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.000\nor MDNS that one runs in\nthe background as well.\n\n328\n00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.670\nIt's helping to locate these devices,\nas well as other things.\n\n329\n00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:29.230\nHere in the finder, it doesn't\nreally show us that stuff right?\n\n330\n00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.889\nBut there's other other utilities\nfrom Apple that do show us, so for\n\n331\n00:18:32.889 --> 00:18:36.500\nexample Apple has utility\ncalled Apple Remote Desktop.\n\n332\n00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:41.220\nAnd what Apple Remote Desktop does\nis it lets you scan, locate, and\n\n333\n00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.540\nmanage Macs on your network.\n\n334\n00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.170\nOne of the neat parts about the utility,\nthough,\n\n335\n00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.545\nis it shows all the different\nways that it can discover things.\n\n336\n00:18:47.545 --> 00:18:51.460\nIt can discover things with Bonjour,\nit can use the local network.\n\n337\n00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:55.860\nIt can actually scan a network range, or a\nparticular IP address from somewhere else.\n\n338\n00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.850\nWe can do file imports to tell the server\nabout each of these Macs that are out\n\n339\n00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.850\nthere, or use a directory server.\n\n340\n00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.917\nAll of these are different ways That it\ncan discover a mark out on the network.\n\n341\n00:19:05.917 --> 00:19:08.185\nAnd that's exactly what the Finder does.\n\n342\n00:19:08.185 --> 00:19:12.091\nThe Finder uses a lot of these same\ntechnologies to be able to populate this\n\n343\n00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:15.115\nlist and have where everybody\nis listed right in there and\n\n344\n00:19:15.115 --> 00:19:18.769\nwe see what's on the network and\nwe can get on there and communicate.\n\n345\n00:19:18.769 --> 00:19:22.439\nCool thing about protocols like\nBonjour there's no configuration.\n\n346\n00:19:22.439 --> 00:19:26.346\nZero configuration, they just,\nthey do what they do, and that's it.\n\n347\n00:19:26.346 --> 00:19:29.747\nUnless you've messed with them, right?\n\n348\n00:19:29.747 --> 00:19:31.358\nFor the most part,\nthey don't even let you mess with it.\n\n349\n00:19:31.358 --> 00:19:36.103\nBut a example of the common mistake I've\nseen is people will jump into their system\n\n350\n00:19:36.103 --> 00:19:40.918\npreferences, go into security and privacy,\nthey'll go into the Firewall tab and\n\n351\n00:19:40.918 --> 00:19:43.361\nthey'll choose to turn on the firewall.\n\n352\n00:19:43.361 --> 00:19:47.849\nAnd if you turn on the firewall in Mac OS\nit makes you invisible on the network.\n\n353\n00:19:47.849 --> 00:19:52.140\nNow people can't discover you unless you\nopen up those services in the firewall.\n\n354\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.460\nThat's how you can interfere\nwith that working.\n\n355\n00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:59.530\nIf you have a brand new Mac and\nyou haven't shared anything out yet,\n\n356\n00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.480\nthen you're gonna be invisible\non the network as well.\n\n357\n00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.510\nThere's actually a lot more Macs on our\nnetwork here at the office than what's\n\n358\n00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.780\nshowing up on this list.\n\n359\n00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.133\nThese are just ones that people\nhave shared something else.\n\n360\n00:20:09.133 --> 00:20:13.455\nSo for example, Cameron, he's one of our\ndevelopers, he shared something out.\n\n361\n00:20:13.455 --> 00:20:16.774\nWell we've got five or\nsix other developers that all have Macs,\n\n362\n00:20:16.774 --> 00:20:20.875\nthey're not showing up in here\nbecause they haven't shared anything.\n\n363\n00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:23.383\nSo, that makes it where they can't\nbe discovered, at least not yet\n\n364\n00:20:23.383 --> 00:20:25.125\nthey're not running those services.\n\n365\n00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:27.433\nBut all this stuff goes\non in the background,\n\n366\n00:20:27.433 --> 00:20:29.670\neach of these devices has a name.\n\n367\n00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.250\nAnd Macs, Macs actually have two names.\n\n368\n00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.530\nYou don't see it a whole lot but\nyou really see one.\n\n369\n00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:40.830\nSo like here, I can see Don's MacBook Pro,\nor Don's Mac Mini, okay.\n\n370\n00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.400\nWell where does that name come from?\n\n371\n00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.730\nIf I go back into my\nsystem preferences and\n\n372\n00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:49.570\nI go into the sharing system preference.\n\n373\n00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.900\nRight in here,\nI see the name of the computer, so\n\n374\n00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.820\nthis one is called Don's Lab Mac.\n\n375\n00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.560\nProblem here though is that\nname has an apostrophe in it,\n\n376\n00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.110\nit also has spaces in it, and in the UNIX\nworld you're not allowed to do that.\n\n377\n00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:06.270\nAnd even in the DNS world, you're not\nallowed to have spaces or apostrophes.\n\n378\n00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:10.092\nSo Apple's really breaking\nstandard naming conventions.\n\n379\n00:21:10.092 --> 00:21:12.200\nSo your Mac has to have a second name,\n\n380\n00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.210\na second name that identifies\nit according to standards.\n\n381\n00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.780\nAnd you normally see that name\nwhen you're in the terminal.\n\n382\n00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:25.764\nIf I fire up my terminal,\nThe prompt is set to Dons-Lab-Mac,\n\n383\n00:21:25.764 --> 00:21:29.333\nbut notice how the apostrophe is gone,\nand the spaces\n\n384\n00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:32.060\nhave been replaced with hyphens.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n385\n00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.625\n&gt;&gt; That's to follow the standard, right,\n\n386\n00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:36.759\nthat's the second name of my Mac.\n\n387\n00:21:36.759 --> 00:21:39.940\nIf you have two Macs on\nthe network with the same name,\n\n388\n00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.126\none of them will have to stick a number\nat the end to undo the ambiguity.\n\n389\n00:21:44.126 --> 00:21:48.669\nSo I might have Dons-Lab-Mac, and\nI bring up another computer, and\n\n390\n00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:52.371\nit'll be Dons-Lab-Mac1 or\nDons-Lab-Mac2 or 3.\n\n391\n00:21:52.371 --> 00:21:56.006\nAnd it just kind of keeps counting up,\ncuz you don't wanna have two machines with\n\n392\n00:21:56.006 --> 00:21:58.155\nthe same name,\nMac OS will sort that out for us.\n\n393\n00:21:58.155 --> 00:22:01.335\nBut that's all part of the discovering\ncommunication process,\n\n394\n00:22:01.335 --> 00:22:03.530\nwe have to have a valid name on our Mac.\n\n395\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.790\nAnd so, when you build a new Mac and\nyou walk through the install and\n\n396\n00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.900\nyou create that first user, it will name\nthat Mac according to the user name that\n\n397\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.870\nyou specified during that install.\n\n398\n00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.690\nIf you have a generic account you use for\nthe install, your Mac will end up with\n\n399\n00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.420\na generic name, and\nthat's when you end up with duplicates.\n\n400\n00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.320\nSo you might need to come in here and\nadjust this.\n\n401\n00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:26.530\nBut otherwise, it's going to basically\njust automatically manage itself,\n\n402\n00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:29.830\nand you'll find resources on the network\nand not have to worry about what protocol\n\n403\n00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.421\nthey are.\n&gt;&gt; What about the Back to My Mac feature,\n\n404\n00:22:32.421 --> 00:22:35.518\ndoes it use the same protocols?\n&gt;&gt; Back to My Mac is almost magical right,\n\n405\n00:22:35.518 --> 00:22:37.817\nthat one's a little different.\n&gt;&gt; Magical thing.\n\n406\n00:22:37.817 --> 00:22:39.652\n&gt;&gt; Because there you're discovering\n\n407\n00:22:39.652 --> 00:22:43.650\na resource on your network that's not\neven in the same building as you.\n\n408\n00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.410\nIt might be in another building\non a different network, and\n\n409\n00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.950\nyou're still discovering it.\n\n410\n00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.750\nBack to My Mac,\nactually leverages iCloud to do that.\n\n411\n00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:55.140\nIf you have Back to My Mac enabled,\nyou've got to be connected to iCloud for\n\n412\n00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.010\nit to work.\n\n413\n00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.230\nSo if I go into my iCloud settings here,\n\n414\n00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.620\nI can see I'm not logged\ninto iCloud right now.\n\n415\n00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.590\nSo Back to My Mac is not working.\n\n416\n00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.190\nBut if I come in and log in,\n\n417\n00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.770\nwhich is gonna require me to remember.\n&gt;&gt; The super secret\n\n418\n00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:07.330\npassword.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n419\n00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.590\nmy password which I think I remember.\n\n420\n00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.750\nRight so I can get connected to iCloud and\n\n421\n00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.660\nthen I can turn on the Back\nto My Mac feature.\n\n422\n00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:20.720\nAnd then I can go to any other Mac, and\nas long as I'm logged into iCloud it will\n\n423\n00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:26.400\nbe able to discover this Mac out there\nwherever it is in the world right?\n\n424\n00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.390\nAnd I'll be able to view this screen.\n\n425\n00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.050\nWe saw Back to My Mac in\nthe iCloud episode, but\n\n426\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.760\nit's using a different protocol.\n\n427\n00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.610\nIt's actually using VNC, which stands for\n\n428\n00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.510\nVirtual Network Computing.\n&gt;&gt; Mm hmm.\n\n429\n00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.620\n&gt;&gt; That's what let's me see the screen.\n\n430\n00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:43.680\nIt uses iCloud to be able to find it,\nwhich I'll be logged into iCloud\n\n431\n00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:49.550\nhere in 20 minutes if I can\nauthenticate enough times.\n\n432\n00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:53.834\nBut it uses iCloud to find the other\nmachine, and then it uses VNC to connect.\n\n433\n00:23:53.834 --> 00:23:55.795\nNow, I keep stressing this iCloud part,\n\n434\n00:23:55.795 --> 00:23:59.389\nyou've gotta have iCloud in order to\nuse the Back to My Mac feature, right?\n\n435\n00:23:59.389 --> 00:24:03.100\nBut you don't have to have\niCloud just to use VNC.\n\n436\n00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.651\nRight?\nPlenty of systems use VNC, even non match.\n\n437\n00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:10.749\nYou can have Windows or Linux systems\nthat use VNC, and you can fire it up and\n\n438\n00:24:10.749 --> 00:24:12.380\nyou can connect them.\n\n439\n00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:18.670\nSo if you want to do that, that\nprocess is a little bit more involved.\n\n440\n00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:22.460\nSo with Back to My Mac, basically\nwhat I do is I fire up my finder.\n\n441\n00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:30.040\nAnd when I go to the Shared screen,\nI'm gonna see every Mac that I know,\n\n442\n00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.340\nincluding ones that might be remote,\nthat I'm seeing through Back to My Mac.\n\n443\n00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.510\nAnd I won't even necessarily\nknow that from here.\n\n444\n00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:40.093\nBut when I click on one of those,\nso if I take Don's Lab Mac,\n\n445\n00:24:40.093 --> 00:24:43.490\nsee up here where it says\nconnected as don@itpro.tv?\n\n446\n00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.610\nThat's my iCloud account.\n\n447\n00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.680\nSo it knows that I'm\nconnected as that account.\n\n448\n00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:53.040\nI see the folders that are available,\nand I've got shared screen.\n\n449\n00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.910\nAnd this will work even if the machine's\non a different network because\n\n450\n00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:00.140\nI've located it, and then it's gonna\nuse VNC to reach out to it, so\n\n451\n00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.510\nI can connect to that system.\n\n452\n00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:06.112\nRight, if I didn't wanna use the back to\nmy Mac system, if I just wanna use VNC,\n\n453\n00:25:06.112 --> 00:25:07.301\nI can still do that.\n\n454\n00:25:07.301 --> 00:25:11.561\nBack on my other system here,\nif I go into sharing,\n\n455\n00:25:11.561 --> 00:25:18.490\ninside of sharing there was a sharing\noption in there for Screen Sharing.\n\n456\n00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:23.350\nWhen you turn on Screen Sharing, that\nenables Back to My Mac functionality, but\n\n457\n00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.503\nit also enables VNC connectivity.\n\n458\n00:25:25.503 --> 00:25:28.640\nSee how it's got the IP address\nof the Mac right there?\n\n459\n00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.640\nSaying, hey,\nyou can connect by specifying this.\n\n460\n00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:37.126\nWell, I should you earlier that if I'm in\nthe finder I can go to the Go menu up top,\n\n461\n00:25:37.126 --> 00:25:39.567\nand I can choose Connect to Server.\n\n462\n00:25:39.567 --> 00:25:44.190\nAnd then I can punch in a server and\nspecify the protocol I wanna use.\n\n463\n00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.130\nWell, you can specify\nVNC as that protocol.\n\n464\n00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:53.392\nAnd when you do that and hit connect\nit's going to remotely connect here.\n\n465\n00:25:53.392 --> 00:25:55.390\nThere we go.\n\n466\n00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.318\nAnd reach out to that machine, and\ntry and connect to its screen, all right?\n\n467\n00:25:59.318 --> 00:26:01.880\nNow, mine is probably gonna fail\nbecause I am using Back to My Mac.\n\n468\n00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.860\nIf this was a Linux or\n\n469\n00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.190\na Windows machine that was running VNC,\nIt would just prompt me for the password.\n\n470\n00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:07.060\nWhat's the password?\n\n471\n00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.560\nAnd then I would see that machine,\nits screen would come up and\n\n472\n00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.710\nI'd be able to use it.\n\n473\n00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.670\nSo, there are other protocols.\n\n474\n00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:13.600\nActually it did work.\n\n475\n00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.450\nYeah, so here I'm on my,\nlet me close some windows here.\n\n476\n00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:18.880\nI'm on my Mac,\n\n477\n00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.750\nthat's the blue star background.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n478\n00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.470\n&gt;&gt; And now I'm remotely viewing the screen\n\n479\n00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.330\nof My Lab Mac.\n\n480\n00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.980\nThat's this window here which I was\nhoping to make a little bigger,\n\n481\n00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.910\nbut apparently is locked\nin on that small size.\n\n482\n00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:33.550\nSo I'm able to see it right here.\n\n483\n00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:37.460\nIt lays it out and now I can work on\nthat machine as if I was sitting at it.\n\n484\n00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.830\nIf I start closing these windows and\nget down to where I'm just looking at\n\n485\n00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:42.920\nthe desktop.\n&gt;&gt; There\n\n486\n00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.000\nit is.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n487\n00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.910\nWell, I can switch over, and\nhere's that actual machine.\n\n488\n00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:48.250\nAnd all those windows are gone, right.\n\n489\n00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:51.700\nAnd if I open up messages,\nthat's gonna come up.\n\n490\n00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.950\nAnd if I come over here, I see on\nthe screen I'm working with it remotely.\n\n491\n00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.470\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n492\n00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.390\n&gt;&gt; And that's all being powered by VMC.\n\n493\n00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.400\nApple didn't write that\nscreen sharing software,\n\n494\n00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.320\nthey used software that\nwas already developed.\n\n495\n00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.170\nThey wrote the iCloud piece to\nlet you find the other system on\n\n496\n00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:04.950\nthe network.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n497\n00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.750\nwhat if we can't find this\nshared resource on the network?\n\n498\n00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:09.770\n&gt;&gt; Well, it could be an iCloud issue,\n\n499\n00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.050\nif it's a remote resource,\nbut if it's a local resource,\n\n500\n00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.120\nyou're not finding it, a lot of times\nit's gonna end up being something like\n\n501\n00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.620\na firewall that's in between you and\nthat resource that you're connecting.\n\n502\n00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.020\nOr maybe a router that's\nblocking that connectivity.\n\n503\n00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.730\nSo in those cases,\nyou can troubleshoot it.\n\n504\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.370\nThe network utility is really handy for\nthis stuff.\n\n505\n00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.068\nActually, let me close\nthis from my screen here.\n\n506\n00:27:28.068 --> 00:27:32.210\nThe network utility is really handy for\nthis.\n\n507\n00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.100\nIf you haven't used it, we've used it\nin a few episodes now I think, but\n\n508\n00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.538\nif we fire up the network utility,\nyou can do things like a ping, and test,\n\n509\n00:27:39.538 --> 00:27:41.570\nit can even talk to the machine.\n\n510\n00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:44.630\nCan I hit the other machine\nthat's out there if I know\n\n511\n00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.334\nits IP address is 10.0.10.7?\n\n512\n00:27:47.334 --> 00:27:49.744\nI can hit ping and\nit's gonna try and connect.\n\n513\n00:27:49.744 --> 00:27:51.790\nCan I talk to it, right?\n\n514\n00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.268\nIf I can't,\nam I getting stopped along the way?\n\n515\n00:27:54.268 --> 00:27:57.720\nIs there something between here and\nthere that's stopping me?\n\n516\n00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.270\nAnd for that you can use trace route\nto run it and map that path out.\n\n517\n00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.090\nIn my case that's a local machine.\n\n518\n00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.412\nSo there shouldn't be anything\nbetween me and it, and\n\n519\n00:28:05.412 --> 00:28:07.490\nI can verify that I can\nreach out in contact to it.\n\n520\n00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.710\nBut you can also do a Port Scan.\n\n521\n00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:14.190\nPort Scans are really handy cuz they can\nhelp you to find out if there's a firewall\n\n522\n00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.910\nblocking your connectivity.\n\n523\n00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:20.753\nSo if I punch in the IP address\nof that system that I wanna\n\n524\n00:28:20.753 --> 00:28:25.072\nconnect to, and I hit scan,\n\n525\n00:28:25.072 --> 00:28:29.880\nit's gonna start checking that host to\nsee if there's any ports that are open.\n\n526\n00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:34.530\nAnd if these come back empty, then\neither the services aren't turned on or\n\n527\n00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.270\nthere's a firewall stopping me.\n\n528\n00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:40.510\nIf it comes back with actual port numbers,\nthen I'll know that I'm able to talk to\n\n529\n00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.890\nit, it must be some other\nproblem that's going on.\n\n530\n00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.520\nSo the network utility is really handy for\ntroubleshooting that stuff.\n\n531\n00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.509\nYou get a quick kind of view.\n\n532\n00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:49.170\nHere, I'm already starting to get\nsome feedback from that server.\n\n533\n00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:53.460\nFTP is open, SSH is open, and it'll\ncontinue to scan and find more protocols\n\n534\n00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.890\nthat are open in that system so I know\nthat I should be able to talk to it.\n\n535\n00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:59.460\nIf these didn't come back,\nI would know to go and\n\n536\n00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.750\nlook at my firewall configuration.\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n537\n00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.460\nWell you know what, I think time is up.\n\n538\n00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.919\nThat's been a grea episide, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n539\n00:29:05.919 --> 00:29:07.384\n&gt;&gt; So sharing resources part two is on\n\n540\n00:29:07.384 --> 00:29:08.970\nthe way, what do you think?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n541\n00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:12.140\nI've got more that I want to get but\nI did ramble on a little too long.\n\n542\n00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.930\nI brought up Apple remote desktop briefly,\nI wanna show that to you guys.\n\n543\n00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:20.720\nIt's on the test very very briefly but in\nreal life it is an incredibly useful tool\n\n544\n00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.880\nfor managing Mac especially\nwhen you get shared resources.\n\n545\n00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.290\nSo I'm gonna show you\nhow that tool works and\n\n546\n00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.130\na few other things in\nthe management space.\n\n547\n00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:29.060\nSo stay tuned for\npart two when we'll catch those.\n\n548\n00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:33.528\nBut, as far as basic challenge,\nwe saw file sharing, printer sharing,\n\n549\n00:29:33.528 --> 00:29:37.145\nwe saw screen sharing through\na couple of different means.\n\n550\n00:29:37.145 --> 00:29:40.820\nWe saw CD and DVD sharing,\nor at least talked about it.\n\n551\n00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.762\nSeveral different technologies like that,\nall available right through your sharing\n\n552\n00:29:44.762 --> 00:29:46.930\npreference inside of\nyour system preference.\n\n553\n00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.720\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic job, Don as usual.\n\n554\n00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.131\nAnd I wanna hear more about cyber duct,\nby the way.\n\n555\n00:29:50.131 --> 00:29:53.600\nSo we're going to go on with Apple\ncertified support professional.\n\n556\n00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.700\nMake sure you see every single episode.\n\n557\n00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.220\nYou'll be very glad you did.\n\n558\n00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.290\nIt will help you in the long run,\nand you'll be in the course library,\n\n559\n00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:02.790\nwhere there's thousands of other videos\nthat are there to help you go further.\n\n560\n00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:03.980\nCheck those out as well.\n\n561\n00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.077\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n562\n00:30:06.077 --> 00:30:07.650\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n563\n00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.483\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n564\n00:30:09.483 --> 00:30:11.110\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again soon.\n\n565\n00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:17.477\n[MUSIC]\n\n566\n00:30:17.477 --> 00:30:20.590\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:12.481\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and\n\n5\n00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:16.401\nthank you for watching ITProTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:17.401\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:22.024\nAs we continue on with Apple Certified\nSupport Professional, Sharing Resources,\n\n8\n00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:22.618\nPart Two.\n\n9\n00:00:22.618 --> 00:00:26.141\nAnd of course, Don Pezet is here\nto share his resources with us.\n\n10\n00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:28.201\nDon, good to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, glad to be back Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:31.690\nAnd in part one we talked about a lot\nof different sharing protocols.\n\n12\n00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.270\nWe went over Apple file protocol and\nSMB, just standard file sharing.\n\n13\n00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.770\nWe talked about printer sharing,\nscreen sharing, Back to My Mac.\n\n14\n00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.320\nAll these different ways of sharing stuff,\n\n15\n00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.700\nbut there's several more\nservices that we didn't get to.\n\n16\n00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.820\nSo we're gonna run through some of\nthose right here in this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.277\nEspecially some management services that I\nthink personally are really, really cool.\n\n18\n00:00:50.277 --> 00:00:53.157\nAnd as a home user you don't care\nabout them, but as a certified support\n\n19\n00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:56.661\nprofessional you're working in a business\nenvironment, you're supporting a lot of\n\n20\n00:00:56.661 --> 00:00:59.260\nMacs, and these are the tools\nthat you're going to want to use.\n\n21\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.850\nSo we're going to take a look at\nthose right here in this subset.\n\n22\n00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.320\n&gt;&gt; Here's a captain obvious question,\n\n23\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.650\nwhat other services are available?\n&gt;&gt; All right, well there's a couple.\n\n24\n00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.620\nI touched lightly on some of\nthem like remote log in, right?\n\n25\n00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.300\nRemote login enables, ssh, and sftp\naccess file transfers now, when I talk\n\n26\n00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.910\nabout in part one, I was talking about it\nfrom the file transfer perspective, right?\n\n27\n00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.560\nI wanna transfer some files,\n\n28\n00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.180\nsftp let's me do it as an encrypted\nconnection great but, from\n\n29\n00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.160\na management perspective we could use ssh\nto be able to connect in, and run scripts,\n\n30\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.380\nrun all the utilities, check permissions,\nfix permissions, back up files.\n\n31\n00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.840\nWhatever it is that you want to do,\nyou can do from the terminal.\n\n32\n00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.720\nYou're basically gaining access to\nthe terminal of another Mac and\n\n33\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.300\nyou can do it without even\nbothering the end users.\n\n34\n00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.010\nThey can be in the system and working and\n\n35\n00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.010\nthey don't even see that\nconnection is occurring.\n\n36\n00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.323\nIt's all in the background,\nwhich is somewhat scary in a way.\n\n37\n00:01:51.323 --> 00:01:52.025\n&gt;&gt; I was just going to say a little bit\n\n38\n00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:53.920\nfrightening.\n&gt;&gt; But if you're the administrator\n\n39\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.097\nof the system, you got that access anyway.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.\n\n40\n00:01:57.097 --> 00:01:59.460\n&gt;&gt; So part in parcel of the system.\n\n41\n00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.650\nSo that's one thing.\n\n42\n00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.444\nThere's also something\ncalled Remote Apple Events.\n\n43\n00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:06.190\nHere, let me instead of just\nsaying the names, let me show you.\n\n44\n00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.640\nI'm going to go into System Preferences\nand I'm going to go into Sharing.\n\n45\n00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.880\nAnd inside of my Sharing here, you'll see\nRemote Login that I was talking about.\n\n46\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.750\nAnd that's what enabled that SSH access or\nSFTP if you're doing file transfers.\n\n47\n00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.966\nBut we also have this remote Apple events,\nokay?\n\n48\n00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:29.329\nIn some of our troubleshooting\nepisodes I showed the console utility.\n\n49\n00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:29.975\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n50\n00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:32.305\n&gt;&gt; And the console utility shows me\n\n51\n00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:36.985\nthe log activity on my Mac, all the stuff\nthat's going on as programs run and\n\n52\n00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:38.775\nif there's errors and\nfailures and stuff like that.\n\n53\n00:02:40.045 --> 00:02:41.690\nThe logs are great.\n\n54\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.710\nBut every single MAC has its own logs,\nand so if you've got 1000 MACs\n\n55\n00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.760\nthat you're managing and you say,\nI see this error on MAC number 273,\n\n56\n00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.340\nI wonder if any other MACs\nare getting the same error.\n\n57\n00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.555\nWell, you'd have to go to all 1000\nof them searching to see if they\n\n58\n00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:03.240\nhad that same error,\nshowing up at the places.\n\n59\n00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.385\nWouldn't it be nice if we had all\nthese logs centralized in one place?\n\n60\n00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:09.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n61\n00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.330\n&gt;&gt; And you can do that,\n\n62\n00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.940\nif you have a macOS server stood up right?\n\n63\n00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.790\nWhich is just macOS with\nthe Server app installed.\n\n64\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.880\nSo if we have a server up, we can use that\nas a central logging destination, and\n\n65\n00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.350\non any of our Macs we can go into our\nSystem Preferences, go into Sharing.\n\n66\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.040\nAnd you can turn on Remote Apple Events,\nand\n\n67\n00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.800\nthat allows you to be able to exchange\nthat information with a central server.\n\n68\n00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.520\nIt also enables a ton\nof automator settings.\n\n69\n00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.730\nIf you ever used the automator\nutility to create script and\n\n70\n00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.520\nautomations, remote apple events\ncan be powered by automation.\n\n71\n00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.200\nAnd so, you can say, hey everyday at 7 pm,\nall these computers go to sleep, and\n\n72\n00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.600\nit can generate that event in\npushing out to the systems and\n\n73\n00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.910\nactually have them go to sleep.\n\n74\n00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.730\nKind of cool stuff that you can do there.\n\n75\n00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.970\nSo that's a big management service\nthat's available kind of tucked away in\n\n76\n00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.450\nthe background.\n\n77\n00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.540\nAll right, now I talked about remote login\nand I talked about Remote Apple Events,\n\n78\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.680\nI'll tell you in all honesty I don't\nusually make use of either of these.\n\n79\n00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.580\nAnd the reason is,\nnot that they aren't good,\n\n80\n00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.820\nbecause they are but because there's\nsomething even better, right.\n\n81\n00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.010\nI skipped over Remote Management.\n\n82\n00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.150\nThis guy right here.\n\n83\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.430\nThis one is commonly misunderstood.\n\n84\n00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.840\nA lot of people look at this and they see,\nall right, Remote Management is off.\n\n85\n00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.970\nRemote management allows other\nusers to access this computer using\n\n86\n00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.879\nApple Remote Desktop.\n\n87\n00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.494\nMicrosoft has a product\ncalled Remote Desktop, and\n\n88\n00:04:31.494 --> 00:04:36.378\nwith Remote Desktop it lets you see\nthe screen of another Windows machine.\n\n89\n00:04:36.378 --> 00:04:41.320\nThat sounds a lot like screen sharing,\nwe already talked about screen sharing.\n\n90\n00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.500\nThis sounds like it does the same\nthing and so people overlook it.\n\n91\n00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.910\nWhen Apple says remote desktop,\nthey are not talking about screen sharing.\n\n92\n00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.210\nThat's one piece of it.\n\n93\n00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.060\nBut there's a heck of a lot more.\n\n94\n00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.433\nIf you're managing five or more Macs,\nI mean really if you're managing two Macs,\n\n95\n00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:57.556\nyou can use this, but\n\n96\n00:04:57.556 --> 00:05:02.060\nif you're managing five or more, this is\na really, really incredibly useful tool.\n\n97\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.025\nCalled Apple Remote Desktop that let's\nyou completely manage your max and\n\n98\n00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:09.004\nit makes life so much easier.\n\n99\n00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:10.358\nNow it's not free.\n\n100\n00:05:10.358 --> 00:05:15.458\nApple Remote Desktop is in\nthe Appstore as of right now it's $80.\n\n101\n00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:18.407\nSo it's actually more expensive then\nthe server app which is kind of funny.\n\n102\n00:05:18.407 --> 00:05:20.458\n&gt;&gt; But that's a one time purchase though,\n\n103\n00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:21.532\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right you buy it,\n\n104\n00:05:21.532 --> 00:05:22.454\nit's part of your account.\n\n105\n00:05:22.454 --> 00:05:25.011\nI bought it years ago and so\nit's been apart of my account for\n\n106\n00:05:25.011 --> 00:05:27.610\na long time\n&gt;&gt; But once you've got it,\n\n107\n00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.680\nyou can then connect out of Manager Max\nif they have remote management turned on.\n\n108\n00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.510\nSo you turn on remote management, and\n\n109\n00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.710\nthat's what allows other systems to\nbe able to connect in and manage it.\n\n110\n00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.796\nSo for example,\nlet me show you how it works.\n\n111\n00:05:39.796 --> 00:05:42.230\nThis is Apple Remote Desktop right here.\n\n112\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.150\nI haven't configured it.\n\n113\n00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.230\nI just launched it, and that's it.\n\n114\n00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.450\nSo I installed it from the App Store,\nand I launched it, and\n\n115\n00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.050\nthis is what the screen looks like.\n\n116\n00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.390\nBefore I get too far, it is automatically\nscanning the network to try and\n\n117\n00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.080\nfind machines to manage.\n\n118\n00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.220\nAnd it automatically found\na Mac Mini in Studio 2.\n\n119\n00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.232\nI'm studio, what is this?\n&gt;&gt; Studio five.\n\n120\n00:06:02.232 --> 00:06:03.101\n&gt;&gt; I'm in studio five.\n\n121\n00:06:03.101 --> 00:06:05.119\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what that Mac Mini is.\n\n122\n00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:07.730\nBut apparently it's got remote management\nturned on and it's sitting over there.\n\n123\n00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.117\nSo we could have-\n&gt;&gt; Someone absconded with it and\n\n124\n00:06:10.117 --> 00:06:11.901\ntook it to studio two.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\n\n125\n00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:14.294\nthey may not even know\nthat it's turned on.\n\n126\n00:06:14.294 --> 00:06:18.080\nBut my lab Mac is not showing up in here,\nright?\n\n127\n00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.400\nAnd that's because I haven't\nturned on remote management yet.\n\n128\n00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.190\nSo if I jump over to my lab Mac.\n\n129\n00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.190\nHere's my lab Mac.\n\n130\n00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.880\nIt's a fresh install of Mac OS High\nSierra, so it doesn't have much turned on.\n\n131\n00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.050\nIf I go into its system preferences and\nI go into sharing.\n\n132\n00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.040\nAnd I find that remote management and\nI turn that on.\n\n133\n00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.549\nAnd when I turn on remote management,\nI get this pop-up.\n\n134\n00:06:41.549 --> 00:06:46.227\nAnd this is the screen that lets you know,\nwait a minute, this is a lot\n\n135\n00:06:46.227 --> 00:06:49.769\nmore than just sharing my screen.\n&gt;&gt; In the Microsoft world,\n\n136\n00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:51.060\nyeah, it's sharing your screen.\n\n137\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.180\nIn the Apple world,\nmy goodness, you can observe.\n\n138\n00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.550\nI can actually see the screen.\n\n139\n00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.470\nOkay, so there's that piece, right?\n\n140\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.230\nAnd if I do that, I can have it\nwhere you just see the screen or\n\n141\n00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.020\nyou can actually see and\ncontrol the screen.\n\n142\n00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.940\nNow, do I want the end user to know it or\ndo I want it to be secret?\n\n143\n00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.400\nIf this is checked the end user will\nknow that I'm looking at their screen.\n\n144\n00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.080\nAnd some states actually require that.\n\n145\n00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.353\nSome countries do too.\n&gt;&gt; Sure, privacy laws.\n\n146\n00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:18.490\n&gt;&gt; But not everywhere.\n\n147\n00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.500\nAnd so you might not need that.\n\n148\n00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.850\nAnd now the end user won't even know that\nyou're looking unless you start moving\n\n149\n00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:22.530\nthe mouse around.\n\n150\n00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.650\nIf you've got control turned off\nnow you can see the screen and\n\n151\n00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.620\nthere's really no way they\nwould know that was happening.\n\n152\n00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.710\nWe've got generate reports, right?\n\n153\n00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.320\nWhen we go into system information,\nwe see our hardware and our applications.\n\n154\n00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.950\nThat's a report.\n\n155\n00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.920\nBut if the report's stored on each\nindividual Mac, I've got 1,000 Macs.\n\n156\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.280\nI would love for\nall that data to be centralized.\n\n157\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.260\nARD can do it, so\nI can generate those reports and\n\n158\n00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.010\nbring it all in to my central ARD server.\n\n159\n00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.992\nOpen and quit applications.\n\n160\n00:07:48.992 --> 00:07:52.727\nIf there's a program that's going crazy or\nI'm managing a school lab and\n\n161\n00:07:52.727 --> 00:07:55.318\na kid has launched some\nprogram that's not right,\n\n162\n00:07:55.318 --> 00:07:58.833\nI see a bit torrent client I can close it,\nshut it down or I can open it.\n\n163\n00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:01.142\nI've got a classroom of 20 kids and I say,\n\n164\n00:08:01.142 --> 00:08:03.710\nall right I want everybody\nto go to this website.\n\n165\n00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.670\nI don't have to tell them to do it.\n\n166\n00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.530\nI can force it to happen.\n\n167\n00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.720\nI can force Safari to launch up and\ngo to a particular URL.\n\n168\n00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.650\nChange settings,\n\n169\n00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.580\nwe can get in to modify the Preferences\nand update settings and so on.\n\n170\n00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.940\nDelete and replace items and\nmodify the file system.\n\n171\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.814\nStart text chat or send messages.\n\n172\n00:08:20.814 --> 00:08:22.660\nI don't have to pick up the phone and\ncall the end user.\n\n173\n00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.680\nI can actually chat right there on\nthe screen, and we can send messages and\n\n174\n00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.666\ncommunicate that way.\n\n175\n00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:30.185\nRestart and shut down the computer and\neven copy files right off it.\n\n176\n00:08:30.185 --> 00:08:34.590\nThese are all things that\nApple Remote Desktop can do,\n\n177\n00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.232\npretty powerful.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n178\n00:08:37.232 --> 00:08:38.822\n&gt;&gt; When you turn this on,\n\n179\n00:08:38.822 --> 00:08:43.248\nlook who it allows access for, everybody.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n180\n00:08:43.248 --> 00:08:44.572\n&gt;&gt; That's not a great setting\n\n181\n00:08:44.572 --> 00:08:45.440\nto have, right?\n\n182\n00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.540\nSo anybody who has a user account,\n\n183\n00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.540\nthe system would be able to use ARD if\nthey had 80 bucks and another Mac, right?\n\n184\n00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.190\nSo we usually wanna change that and\nso we can say only certain users.\n\n185\n00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.370\nAnd what I typically do is create\nsome kind of standard account,\n\n186\n00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.640\nlike a help desk account or something.\n\n187\n00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.330\nBut when you create users like this,\nyou can go through, and\n\n188\n00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.430\nyou can specify different permissions.\n\n189\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.370\nSo I might want some people\nwhere they can just observe, but\n\n190\n00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.220\nother people I want to have all access.\n\n191\n00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.490\nI can really get into there and\ntweak that and customize it and change it.\n\n192\n00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.500\nYou've got that flexibility, right?\n\n193\n00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.011\nBut once that's done, now my lab Mac\nis ready to be remotely managed.\n\n194\n00:09:21.011 --> 00:09:26.340\nAnd if I go back to my Mac,\nit found it automatically, right?\n\n195\n00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.580\nThat's that Bonjour protocol,\nit's been watching the network.\n\n196\n00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.600\nAnd it said, whoa, wait look,\nI just found another machine.\n\n197\n00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.470\nIt's out there, waiting for\nme to connect, waiting for\n\n198\n00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.280\nme to see if I can manage it and\nuse it, all right?\n\n199\n00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.975\nBut I'm not connected yet,\nsee all over here, look,\n\n200\n00:09:39.975 --> 00:09:41.741\nthe ARD Version isn't showing up.\n\n201\n00:09:41.741 --> 00:09:45.280\nAnd it's got a gray icon,\nas opposed to a blue icon.\n\n202\n00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.970\nSo I haven't actually talked to it yet,\nwe just discovered it.\n\n203\n00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:54.119\nBut if I connect to it or start to\nlook through the information here.\n\n204\n00:09:54.119 --> 00:09:57.177\nIt's gonna tell me,\nin this case, it's telling me,\n\n205\n00:09:57.177 --> 00:10:01.050\nDon's Lab Mac is running software that\nis too old to support this feature.\n\n206\n00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.280\nIt must be running Apple Remote Desktop\nClient 3.3.1 or later, in order\n\n207\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.460\nto provide the list of administrative\ncomputers which can manage it, so\n\n208\n00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.950\nI must not have updated that machine.\n\n209\n00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.810\nRemember I mentioned it\nwas a fresh install?\n\n210\n00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.280\nSo it must be behind on its updates.\n\n211\n00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.120\nBut if I update that one and\nI guess I could double-check on it.\n\n212\n00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.027\nThere are some App Store updates in here,\nso I can go into the updates and\n\n213\n00:10:23.027 --> 00:10:24.920\nit should turn up fine.\n\n214\n00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.470\nOnce you manage it from the beginning,\nyou'll always be able to manage it.\n\n215\n00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.552\nAnd you can push updates out and\nsolve that but yeah,\n\n216\n00:10:31.552 --> 00:10:36.120\nthere's a 10.13.3 supplemental update,\nwhich I thought this one had.\n\n217\n00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.152\nBut that's right, 10.13.3 got\nreissued because of the Specter and\n\n218\n00:10:41.152 --> 00:10:43.100\nMeltdown bugs.\n&gt;&gt; Right, Specter.\n\n219\n00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.640\n&gt;&gt; So there was a reissue on that one, so\n\n220\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.110\nI'll need to update for that.\n\n221\n00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.520\nSo it's a little unhappy,\nbut once it gets over that,\n\n222\n00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.050\nwe'll be able to connect and manage that.\n\n223\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.905\nI've got that Mac Mini Studio\n2 showing up here.\n\n224\n00:10:54.905 --> 00:11:01.160\nSo I could probably connect to it and\nfind out what information I can get on it.\n\n225\n00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.380\nSo when I look at it, I can start\nto find a little more information.\n\n226\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.730\nNow it's telling me that I'm not\nallowed to generate reports, so\n\n227\n00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.530\nI must not have permissions\non that particular system.\n\n228\n00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.060\nSo I may not have the full access to it,\nI might need to kind of tweak that and\n\n229\n00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.743\nadjust it.\n&gt;&gt; Don, I saw that you reached out and\n\n230\n00:11:14.743 --> 00:11:15.701\nconnected to one computer.\n\n231\n00:11:15.701 --> 00:11:18.617\nIf you have to do one computer at a time,\nthat it can take a while,\n\n232\n00:11:18.617 --> 00:11:22.417\nif you've got 1,000 computers and can\nyou do more than one computer at a time?\n\n233\n00:11:22.417 --> 00:11:24.080\n&gt;&gt; So yes you can and\n\n234\n00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.350\nthere's a few different ways to do it and\nnone of which are on this exam,\n\n235\n00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.360\nbut they're all useful to know.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n236\n00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.510\n&gt;&gt; If I had to do something on 1,000\n\n237\n00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.730\nmachines, I wouldn't wanna go and\n\n238\n00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.800\ncreate a user account in 1,000 machines.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n239\n00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.468\n&gt;&gt; And check off all those boxes for\n\n240\n00:11:35.468 --> 00:11:37.474\nremote management on all those machines.\n\n241\n00:11:37.474 --> 00:11:39.660\nSo instead, I would do one of two things.\n\n242\n00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.860\nEither one,\nbuild a custom MacOS install image.\n\n243\n00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.180\nSo that when you installed Mac OS,\nit already had the remote desktop user and\n\n244\n00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.580\nthe permissions were\nalready a part of this.\n\n245\n00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.780\nSo you can do it that way.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n246\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.710\n&gt;&gt; Or two, if you use the Profile manager,\n\n247\n00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:57.360\nProfile Manager is a part of Apple remote,\nsorry, it's a part of the Mac OS Server\n\n248\n00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.100\napp, which is $20 in the App Store,\nit's from Apple.\n\n249\n00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.910\nAnd with the Profile Manager, you can\ndefine all those settings there, and\n\n250\n00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.520\nyou can push them out to the Macs and\n\n251\n00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.240\nthey apply that way too.\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n252\n00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.010\n&gt;&gt; Very, very similar, so\n\n253\n00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.350\neither solution would knock it out and\n\n254\n00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.490\nthat would be an excellent idea\nin the business environment.\n\n255\n00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:18.752\nThe other thing is, once your Mac is\nenabled for this, it just shows up in ARD.\n\n256\n00:12:18.752 --> 00:12:21.934\nSo if I had 1,000 Macs that\nI turned on today that all\n\n257\n00:12:21.934 --> 00:12:25.880\nhad Remote Management turned on,\nthey just automatically show up.\n\n258\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.739\nAnd so if I switch back over to my\nsystem and I look at Remote Desktop,\n\n259\n00:12:29.739 --> 00:12:33.560\nI didn't add it in, Don's Lab Mac\njust automatically showed up.\n\n260\n00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.199\n&gt;&gt; You bet.\n\n261\n00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:35.418\n&gt;&gt; There it is, it appeared, right?\n\n262\n00:12:35.418 --> 00:12:40.180\nSo the moment I turned that feature on,\nBonjour was able to detect that.\n\n263\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:44.080\nAnd if it didn't, I could come in and\nsay you know what, let me manually put in\n\n264\n00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.180\nthe address or import a file that\nhas the IPs of all of the systems.\n\n265\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.940\nBut it found it right there,\nall I have to do is classify it.\n\n266\n00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.510\nBy default,\nyou have this All Computers group.\n\n267\n00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:57.760\nAnd really, what they expect you\nto do is called creating lists.\n\n268\n00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:04.470\nThese lists allow you to classify\ncomputers, so I might stay Student Laptops\n\n269\n00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:09.890\nand oops, Student Desktops.\n\n270\n00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:14.800\nI might have Teacher Workstations,\nright, because I might have different\n\n271\n00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.580\nrequirements for\ndifferent systems or whatever.\n\n272\n00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.349\nSo I can come through and\nI can start to classify those.\n\n273\n00:13:19.349 --> 00:13:23.376\nAnd when a computer is detected,\nall I've gotta do is take it and\n\n274\n00:13:23.376 --> 00:13:26.090\nthrow it into the right category.\n\n275\n00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.620\nAnd when I do that, it's gonna say okay,\n\n276\n00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.960\nwhat credentials are we gonna\nuse to manage that system?\n\n277\n00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.590\nSo I've got an account on that system,\nI'll punch it in.\n\n278\n00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.980\nThis needs to be\nan administrator on that system.\n\n279\n00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.610\nIf you have a centralized directory,\nthen you've already got an administrator\n\n280\n00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.930\naccount that works everywhere,\nso you can use that one.\n\n281\n00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.317\nIn my case, I don't have a directory,\nso I have to use a local account.\n\n282\n00:13:44.317 --> 00:13:48.202\nSo I add that one in, it's gonna reach\nout to that system and talk to it and\n\n283\n00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:51.050\nsee that little blue circle that appeared?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n284\n00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:52.194\n&gt;&gt; That lets me know that I'm\n\n285\n00:13:52.194 --> 00:13:53.243\nnow managing that Mac.\n\n286\n00:13:53.243 --> 00:13:56.616\nI'm not managing the one over in Studio\n2 cuz I don't have access on it, but\n\n287\n00:13:56.616 --> 00:13:57.788\nI am managing my machine.\n\n288\n00:13:57.788 --> 00:14:00.663\nOn the client side,\nthey don't seen anything different,\n\n289\n00:14:00.663 --> 00:14:02.840\ntheir Mac just looks like normal.\n\n290\n00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.840\nBut on my side,\nI can come in here to Student Laptops and\n\n291\n00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.440\nthere's Don's Lab Mac, right?\n\n292\n00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:15.480\nAnd I can work with just that Mac or I can\nwork with everything in that list at once.\n\n293\n00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.980\nThere can be 1,000 Student Laptops and\nI can make a change that applies to\n\n294\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.000\nall 1,000 of them, all at once.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n295\n00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.700\nthat's a time saver.\n&gt;&gt; And you see buttons up here for\n\n296\n00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.070\na lot of that, we can do copy and Install.\n\n297\n00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.580\nI can install software,\nlike drivers, packages and\n\n298\n00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.400\npush that out to these machines\nwithout even talking to the end user.\n\n299\n00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.596\nJust pushes it, they call me on the phone\nlike Don, I really need this software,\n\n300\n00:14:38.596 --> 00:14:40.909\nokay, it's installed,\nyou should have it now, right?\n\n301\n00:14:40.909 --> 00:14:45.680\nJust like that, you can do UNIX,\nif you click on that, you get the shell.\n\n302\n00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.410\nAnd so you can tell it, hey,\nI want you to run this UNIX command.\n\n303\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.970\nWe'll do uname -a and\nyou tell it to execute.\n\n304\n00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:56.440\nWe send that along, and it runs it,\nand here's the output of that command.\n\n305\n00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.770\nIt just ran it over on that other Mac, if\nI wanted to copy files, I could do that.\n\n306\n00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.495\nI mentioned Cyberduck in the last episode,\nright?\n\n307\n00:15:04.495 --> 00:15:05.440\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n308\n00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.050\n&gt;&gt; So over here on that actual\n\n309\n00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:08.150\nMac that I'm managing.\n\n310\n00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.895\nOops, no, leave me alone, Siri.\n\n311\n00:15:09.895 --> 00:15:13.430\n[LAUGH] If I go into Finder and\nI go into Applications,\n\n312\n00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:14.950\nI haven't even installed anything on this.\n\n313\n00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.770\nIt's a clean install, so\nthere's no Cyberduck to be found.\n\n314\n00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.100\nAnd if I scroll all the way to the bottom,\nno Cyberduck here.\n\n315\n00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.195\nIf I wanna install Cyberduck,\nfor whatever reason,\n\n316\n00:15:25.195 --> 00:15:28.018\nI could copy it over right from here.\n\n317\n00:15:28.018 --> 00:15:32.249\nIf I go up here to the Copy button,\nit's got items that I can copy and\n\n318\n00:15:32.249 --> 00:15:34.531\nwhere I wanna send them to, right?\n\n319\n00:15:34.531 --> 00:15:38.859\nSo I'm gonna choose to add in an item\nto copy, and I'm gonna go and\n\n320\n00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:44.180\nfind let's see in my Applications I\ndo have Cyberduck on my own computer.\n\n321\n00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.756\nSo I'm gonna find Cyberduck.\n&gt;&gt; By golly, they have a duck even.\n\n322\n00:15:46.756 --> 00:15:48.091\n&gt;&gt; It is a giant rubber duck.\n\n323\n00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:50.506\nAnd then I tell it what I wanna do.\n\n324\n00:15:50.506 --> 00:15:52.422\nDo I wanna put it in\nthe User's Desktop Folder?\n\n325\n00:15:52.422 --> 00:15:54.025\nWell, this is a program.\n\n326\n00:15:54.025 --> 00:15:57.770\nSo if I drop that down,\nI can put it in the application folder,\n\n327\n00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.080\nwhich is the same effect as installing it,\nright?\n\n328\n00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.910\nIf the item already exists,\ndo I wanna replace it?\n\n329\n00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.460\nI'll say replace it if\nthe existing item is older.\n\n330\n00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.770\nIf my copy is newer, let's replace it,\notherwise leave it alone.\n\n331\n00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.682\nWho do I set the item ownership to?\n\n332\n00:16:11.682 --> 00:16:13.730\nI'm gonna leave it to the default.\n\n333\n00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.122\nAnd then if a problem occurs,\nwhat do I do?\n\n334\n00:16:16.122 --> 00:16:18.070\nStop the copy on all targets?\n\n335\n00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.860\nWell, if I'm going to 1,000 computers and\none fails,\n\n336\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.490\nI don't wanna stop on the 999 others,\nso I'm gonna leave that off.\n\n337\n00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:25.657\nAfter we copy, what do we do?\n\n338\n00:16:25.657 --> 00:16:26.700\nDo we want it to open?\n\n339\n00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.130\nWe can do that, we can have it launch.\n\n340\n00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.752\nDo I wanna send this across\nthe network encrypted?\n\n341\n00:16:30.752 --> 00:16:32.840\nDo I wanna limit the network usage?\n\n342\n00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.520\nIf I'm pushing this out to 1,000 machines,\n\n343\n00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.180\nI might not wanna push all\n1,000 of them at the same time.\n\n344\n00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.454\nSo I can limit the network\nusage to throttle that down,\n\n345\n00:16:40.454 --> 00:16:41.770\nit'll do them in batches.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n346\n00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.497\nIt actually batches anyway,\nit does things in batches of ten\n\n347\n00:16:44.497 --> 00:16:45.160\nby default.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n348\n00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:49.290\nYou can override that, but it's gonna do\nthat regardless of what I choose here.\n\n349\n00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.660\nAnd then down at the bottom I can\npick which machines I wanna push.\n\n350\n00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:58.460\nI picked the student laptops list, but\nI can still pick even inside of that.\n\n351\n00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.913\nAnd I can schedule this to\noccur at a certain time.\n\n352\n00:17:00.913 --> 00:17:02.990\nI'm gonna go and hit copy,\nso it does it now.\n\n353\n00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.090\nAnd so it's gonna run.\n\n354\n00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:08.100\nAnd I'll see under active tasks,\nI've got copy items, here it goes copying.\n\n355\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.651\nIt's sending that Cyberduck utility over\nto the other machine and it'll finish,\n\n356\n00:17:12.651 --> 00:17:14.287\nit's almost done, 98%.\n\n357\n00:17:14.287 --> 00:17:15.522\nThere we go, done.\n\n358\n00:17:15.522 --> 00:17:16.785\nIt's now copied over.\n\n359\n00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:20.912\nOkay, now meanwhile, back over here,\nthe end user, if they're\n\n360\n00:17:20.912 --> 00:17:25.719\nin the applications folder, they suddenly\nsee that Cyberduck icon up here.\n\n361\n00:17:25.719 --> 00:17:26.326\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n362\n00:17:26.326 --> 00:17:27.008\n&gt;&gt; But otherwise,\n\n363\n00:17:27.008 --> 00:17:29.100\nthey don't know that anything happened.\n\n364\n00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.368\nAnd now they can come in and\nthey can open that up.\n\n365\n00:17:31.368 --> 00:17:35.910\nAnd any moment now, did you go in back,\nthere it is, Cyberduck pops up.\n\n366\n00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.590\nAnd notice, I didn't even get\nthe gatekeeper notification that says\n\n367\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.990\nwarning this application was\ndownloaded from the Internet.\n\n368\n00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.170\nBecause it knows that we pushed\nit from Apple Remote Desktop, so\n\n369\n00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:49.076\nan administrator has already approved it,\nthe end user can fire it up.\n\n370\n00:17:49.076 --> 00:17:52.212\nAs far as like sharing resources on\nthe network, ARD, Apple Remote Desktop,\n\n371\n00:17:52.212 --> 00:17:55.491\nis a lifesaver, it is probably the best\n$80 I've ever spent in my entire life,\n\n372\n00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:58.466\ncuz you can get this one utility and\nyou can manage thousands of machines-\n\n373\n00:17:58.466 --> 00:18:03.680\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n374\n00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.980\n&gt;&gt; All from right inside of one place,\n\n375\n00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.660\nreally really slick stuff.\n\n376\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.880\nI didn't even show things\nlike the screen monitoring.\n\n377\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:14.870\nSo for example if I want to connect and\nview the screen of that system,\n\n378\n00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:19.200\nI can choose that Mac and\nhit observe and now I'm looking at it.\n\n379\n00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.780\nI'm just watching, just watching, right?\n\n380\n00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.340\nBut then if I wanna interact I can come up\nhere and I can click the interact button.\n\n381\n00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.370\nAnd now I'm not just watching anymore,\nnow I'm interacting and\n\n382\n00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.950\nI'm actually using it but\nI can go back to observe.\n\n383\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.310\nAnd while I'm doing this,\nlet's say that the user,\n\n384\n00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.310\nthey want us to do something and we needed\nto provide administrative credentials.\n\n385\n00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.170\nWith them watching you,\n\n386\n00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.400\nmaybe you have to type a password in a way\nthey can see, which you shouldn't have to,\n\n387\n00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.300\nbut I wanna do something I don't\nwant them to see what I'm doing.\n\n388\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.250\nYou can hit this curtain button up top,\nright?\n\n389\n00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.607\nAnd, did I not give myself, I must not\nhave given myself permission to do it, no,\n\n390\n00:18:53.607 --> 00:18:56.560\nsorry, I've gotten out\nof interactive mode.\n\n391\n00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.815\nSo I'm going back into interactive\nmode here, absolute control, right?\n\n392\n00:18:59.815 --> 00:19:00.637\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n393\n00:19:00.637 --> 00:19:03.049\n&gt;&gt; And then I can click this curtain,\n\n394\n00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:03.636\nright?\n\n395\n00:19:03.636 --> 00:19:09.835\nAnd I'll just say system\nmaintenance is ongoing, all right?\n\n396\n00:19:09.835 --> 00:19:13.380\nAnd for me as the administrator,\nI can now get in here and work, right?\n\n397\n00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.807\nSo I can take the system and\nI can start to do whatever I need, right?\n\n398\n00:19:16.807 --> 00:19:20.382\nSo here I am, I'm working on it,\nI'm able to browse around and do things.\n\n399\n00:19:20.382 --> 00:19:24.839\nBut on the client what they see is this,\nthey see a giant padlock.\n\n400\n00:19:24.839 --> 00:19:28.130\nThe screen is locked by Don Pezet and\nthey can't do anything,\n\n401\n00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.918\nthey can't see what I'm doing.\n\n402\n00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:32.147\nAnd I can get in there and\nI can fix whatever the issue is.\n\n403\n00:19:32.147 --> 00:19:34.605\nAnd I don't have to worry about\nthem seeing my passwords or\n\n404\n00:19:34.605 --> 00:19:36.720\nwhat secret resources I have to access.\n\n405\n00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.830\nAnd when I'm done, I can just remove that\ncurtain and now it's gonna unlock it.\n\n406\n00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.880\nAnd for them,\nnow they can access back to their machine.\n\n407\n00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.130\nThat's all a big part of Apple Remote\nDesktop, and it's just really,\n\n408\n00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.380\nreally slick stuff.\n\n409\n00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:54.320\nSo if you're managing in a corporate\nenterprise, educational environment,\n\n410\n00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.460\na utility like this is super handy for\nmanaging shared resources.\n\n411\n00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.820\nFor a home user, you just get up and\nwalk over to the other computer, right?\n\n412\n00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.190\nSo you don't need a tool like\nthis to be able to manage it.\n\n413\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:05.410\nBut in a business world,\n\n414\n00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.100\nthis is really, really important stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, is there anything else\n\n415\n00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.620\nthat's common to share?\n&gt;&gt; I think we've covered the bulk of it,\n\n416\n00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.900\nthere's a few like less common things.\n\n417\n00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.320\nIf I go back into,\nactually here we'll just go on my desktop.\n\n418\n00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.120\nIf I go back into my\nsystem preferences and\n\n419\n00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:24.260\nI go into my sharing screen,\nwe talked about most of these.\n\n420\n00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.800\nThe last couple of ones,\nInternet, Bluetooth, and\n\n421\n00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.490\ncontent sharing, Internet sharing.\n\n422\n00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.690\nIf my computer is plugged into\na cable modem or a DSL modem and\n\n423\n00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:38.430\nI want other computers in my house to be\nable to get access through my computer,\n\n424\n00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.650\nthen I can do Internet sharing.\n\n425\n00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.471\nIt's useful if you're in\nlike a hotel room and\n\n426\n00:20:41.471 --> 00:20:43.443\nthey only give you one\ncomputer that can connect.\n\n427\n00:20:43.443 --> 00:20:46.605\nI could connect my Mac and then have\nit share the Internet access with other\n\n428\n00:20:46.605 --> 00:20:49.040\nsystems, it requires two network adapters.\n\n429\n00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.270\nSo usually it's a physical adapter and\na wireless adapter, so you create your\n\n430\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.700\nown ad hoc wireless network.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n431\n00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:55.980\n&gt;&gt; You can do the same with Bluetooth\n\n432\n00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.110\nthough, and so we've got Bluetooth\nsharing, which does that.\n\n433\n00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:04.090\nContent caching, if people are\nsynchronizing iCloud, if I have like five\n\n434\n00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.730\ncomputers near, they're all synchronizing\nmy iCloud account, instead of all five\n\n435\n00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:11.910\nreaching out to iCloud, one of them can\ngo to iCloud and the other four can just\n\n436\n00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.730\ngo to the one that's local, and\nthat cuts down on bandwidth.\n\n437\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.140\nSo that's another thing that we can do,\nand\n\n438\n00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.860\nthat ties in with Internet\nconnection sharing.\n\n439\n00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.060\nThose three are not very common,\nmost of us aren't gonna use those.\n\n440\n00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.560\nAs a home user, we don't normally have\nfive computers that are all seeking\n\n441\n00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.920\nthe same iCloud account, so there's that.\n\n442\n00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.800\nIn the business world, we'll usually\nuse Mac OS server to do this.\n\n443\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.665\nMac OS server has some content caching\nfeatures that are superior to this that\n\n444\n00:21:36.665 --> 00:21:38.155\nare definitely more useful.\n\n445\n00:21:38.155 --> 00:21:41.022\nSo these are here but\nthey are less common.\n\n446\n00:21:41.022 --> 00:21:41.646\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic,\n\n447\n00:21:41.646 --> 00:21:45.683\nanother wonderful episode presented by\nDon Pezet, sharing resources, part two.\n\n448\n00:21:45.683 --> 00:21:47.270\nMake sure you see part one.\n\n449\n00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.939\nAnd Don, you have that look in your eye.\n\n450\n00:21:48.939 --> 00:21:52.860\nYou wanna say something else, I can tell.\n&gt;&gt; Everything that I showed here,\n\n451\n00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.700\nthis was all in the built-in\nsharing inside of Mac OS.\n\n452\n00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.720\nThere's tons of third-party stuff,\nand it is UNIX under the hood.\n\n453\n00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.180\nSo any type of crazy UNIX sharing\nyou can do like rsync and\n\n454\n00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.690\nstuff, that's down there,\nit's under there.\n\n455\n00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:08.960\nApple won't support you with it but it is\nthere, so don't hesitate to use those.\n\n456\n00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.470\nOn the exam they will just focus\non the ones that are built in, so\n\n457\n00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:13.700\nkeep that in mind.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n458\n00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.270\nalso keep in mind that you should\nwatch every single episode of\n\n459\n00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:20.180\nApple Certified Support Professional,\nyou'll be so glad that you did.\n\n460\n00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.900\nYou'll also be in the course library\nwhere there's lot's of other videos there\n\n461\n00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.156\ndesigned to do one thing\nto help you go furthest.\n\n462\n00:22:26.156 --> 00:22:27.270\nSo check those out too.\n\n463\n00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.243\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n464\n00:22:29.243 --> 00:22:31.256\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n465\n00:22:31.256 --> 00:22:33.757\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:16.450\nwatching ITPro.TV helping\nyou learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.082\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue on\nwith Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n8\n00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:25.890\nWe're gonna be using iCloud in this\nepisode and Don Pezet said he'd help us do\n\n9\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.540\nthat, didn't you, Don?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n10\n00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.325\nI guess.\n&gt;&gt; He did.\n\n11\n00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:31.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, in a number of\n\n12\n00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.570\nepisodes in this series you guys have\nseen me login with a new user account and\n\n13\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.650\nskip the iCloud synchonization.\n\n14\n00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.730\nI've skipped it over and over again,\nand I've done that for a reason,\n\n15\n00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.840\nbecause I don't wanna have 10,000\nthings synced up to iCloud.\n\n16\n00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.930\nBut, we do need to talk about iCloud,\n\n17\n00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.370\nbecause it is very powerful, provides\na lot of features and functionality.\n\n18\n00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.660\nAnd for the most part it's free.\n\n19\n00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.150\nSo you might as well take advantage\n\n20\n00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.010\nof that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n21\n00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.922\n&gt;&gt; You really do get some cool\n\n22\n00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:55.633\nfeatures out of it.\n\n23\n00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:58.053\nSo, in this episode we're\ngonna take a look at iCloud.\n\n24\n00:00:58.053 --> 00:01:02.114\nI'm not gonna skip that login this time\nand we are actually gonna get set up\n\n25\n00:01:02.114 --> 00:01:03.020\nto use it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n26\n00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.710\nAnd we'll get a chance to see\nwhat iCloud can do for us and\n\n27\n00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.310\nhow we can take advantage of it.\n\n28\n00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.830\nOr we can make the decision over whether\nor not we actually do wanna use it.\n\n29\n00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.220\nBut that's all coming up\nright here in this episode.\n\n30\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.249\n&gt;&gt; And what data can we synchronize with\n\n31\n00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:17.775\niCloud?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that's where iCloud\n\n32\n00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:21.851\ncreates the biggest confusion,\ncuz it can do so many different things.\n\n33\n00:01:21.851 --> 00:01:26.269\nThat when iCloud launched back in the very\nbeginning, it was really just for\n\n34\n00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:28.905\nbasic authentication there's an Apple ID.\n\n35\n00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:31.914\nAnd then it got tied to the iTunes store,\nso that you can go in and buy apps.\n\n36\n00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:32.994\nThat was what it did.\n\n37\n00:01:32.994 --> 00:01:35.515\nWell then those apps needed\nto be able to save data, so\n\n38\n00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:37.470\nthey could save it into iCloud.\n\n39\n00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.120\nAnd then iCloud expanded\nout to connect to Mac OS.\n\n40\n00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.250\nSo by the time it connected to Mac OS\nit was already growing in features.\n\n41\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.940\nAnd then it's continued to grow and\n\n42\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.830\ngrow adding more and more,\nso that it doesn't just hold\n\n43\n00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.190\nyour Angry Birds save game anymore.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.960\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n45\n00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.910\nit can save all the documents\nthat you work with.\n\n46\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.660\nAnd iCloud has a bunch of features.\n\n47\n00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.390\nAnd the best way to see it, is if we\nadd an iCloud account on our system.\n\n48\n00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.710\nSo let me show you on my machine.\n\n49\n00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.950\nI've got a fresh install\nof my Echo Sierra,\n\n50\n00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.930\nhigh Sierra here.\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n\n51\n00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.900\n&gt;&gt; And I did skip the iCloud settings on\n\n52\n00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.270\nthis, when I was running\nthrough that wizard.\n\n53\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.770\nSo I'm gonna have to go to\nthe System Preferences to get this set up.\n\n54\n00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.330\nBut in this System Preferences,\n\n55\n00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.310\nyou'll find the iCloud icon right there.\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n56\n00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.860\n&gt;&gt; We can jump into it.\n\n57\n00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.790\nIf I had signed in, I'd be seeing\na lot of iCloud settings right\n\n58\n00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.520\nnow.\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm, hm-mm.\n\n59\n00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.945\n&gt;&gt; Instead I see the Use Data Password.\n\n60\n00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:31.635\nNow an iCloud account is free if you don't\nhave one you can hit create Apple ID and\n\n61\n00:02:31.635 --> 00:02:32.972\nyou can generate one.\n\n62\n00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:35.125\nIf you have an iPhone you\nlikely already have one,\n\n63\n00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:36.827\nif you don't have one you can set it up.\n\n64\n00:02:36.827 --> 00:02:38.078\nIt asks for a credit card, but\n\n65\n00:02:38.078 --> 00:02:40.793\nthe credit card is optional you\nactually don't have to have it.\n\n66\n00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:43.007\nSo it can be totally free to get\nin there and get this set up.\n\n67\n00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:43.933\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n68\n00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:45.585\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna log in with mine,\n\n69\n00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:49.160\nI'll punch in my account information\nI'll punch in my password.\n\n70\n00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.280\n&gt;&gt; And then I'll sign in.\n\n71\n00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.920\nNow on your account if you just set it up\nyou may have normal authentication set up,\n\n72\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.760\nusername and password and you're in.\n\n73\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.280\nOn my account I have dual\nfactor authentication.\n\n74\n00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.657\nSo immediately it pops up here with\na enter the verification code sent to your\n\n75\n00:03:04.657 --> 00:03:05.409\nother devices.\n\n76\n00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.452\nI can go to any other device that\nI have that's an Apple devices.\n\n77\n00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:13.443\nIt's signed in with that Apple ID, and\nit will be displaying the code to me to be\n\n78\n00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.590\nable to authenticate and to get in.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n79\n00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.350\n&gt;&gt; The problem is my other Apple devices\n\n80\n00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.020\nare, where are they?\n\n81\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.903\nThey're in my office.\n\n82\n00:03:20.903 --> 00:03:22.007\nSo I don't have them right here\n&gt;&gt; Not here.\n\n83\n00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:23.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna tell it\n\n84\n00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.190\nto do this a different way and\nget that code sent to me.\n\n85\n00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.900\nSo I'll just have it text\nme a code on my phone.\n\n86\n00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.350\nAnd, so now I just need a way for\n\n87\n00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.370\nthat text message to come in,\nthat's gonna give me the code to punch in.\n\n88\n00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.720\nThis is really important, because if\nwe're syncing our data up in iCloud,\n\n89\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.500\nwe could be syncing photos,\ndocuments, personal information.\n\n90\n00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.540\nWe don't want just anybody being able\nto connect to our iCloud account and\n\n91\n00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.110\ndownload all of our stuff.\n\n92\n00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.450\nWe wanna make sure that it is us.\n\n93\n00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.230\nSo when you sign up for a new account,\nit will offer turn on two fact\n\n94\n00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.030\nauthentication, and\nthat's a really good idea.\n\n95\n00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.660\nIf was over with my Mac mini,\nI would already see this code and\n\n96\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.570\nbe able to punch it in.\n\n97\n00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.420\nBut because I did the text message,\nI now have to wait until it comes in on my\n\n98\n00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.820\nphone, which it might\nhave already come in.\n\n99\n00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.544\nSometimes I miss my little\nvibration alert thing.\n\n100\n00:04:11.644 --> 00:04:16.003\nNope, shoot, so now I get to wait\npatiently for my text message to appear.\n\n101\n00:04:19.427 --> 00:04:23.441\nAll right, and you can actually see the\nlong string of codes here that I received.\n\n102\n00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:26.260\nEvery time that I log into this thing,\nand I just got my new one.\n\n103\n00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.400\nSo all right, so now I'm ready.\n\n104\n00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.230\nI can come in here and\n\n105\n00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.910\nI can punch in my code.\n&gt;&gt; Super secret.\n\n106\n00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.960\n&gt;&gt; And we'll get that in there.\n\n107\n00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.980\nYou say super secret, right?\n\n108\n00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.320\nI just typed that code\neverybody could see it.\n\n109\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.850\nThose codes are what are called OTP's or\none time passwords.\n\n110\n00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.880\nThey can only be used once.\n&gt;&gt; Once,\n\n111\n00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.930\nonly once.\n&gt;&gt; I just used it once,\n\n112\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.962\nwhich means even if you have it,\nits no longer good anymore.\n\n113\n00:04:48.962 --> 00:04:52.640\nThat the whole list of all\nthese codes that I've received.\n\n114\n00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.320\nThey've all been used, so they're all\ngone, and that's it, it's moved on.\n\n115\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.950\nNow, when I touched iCloud,\n\n116\n00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.270\nmy Apple ID has a password, my user\naccount on this computer has a password.\n\n117\n00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.400\nAnd in order to connect the two together,\nI've gotta provide that information, so\n\n118\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.030\nthat it'll be able to connect those.\n\n119\n00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.800\nSo I'm gonna punch that in.\n\n120\n00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.100\nAnd once I've got it,\nI'll say okay to that.\n\n121\n00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.420\nAnd now, it's gonna connect my\ncomputer to my iCloud account.\n\n122\n00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.420\nAnd as soon as it's done,\n\n123\n00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.140\nI'm gonna see a list of all of\nthe things that I can synchronize.\n\n124\n00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.610\nAnd, my Mac mini is here\nin the building as well.\n\n125\n00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.590\nAnd it's basically asking me, hey,\nif I want to connect these two together.\n\n126\n00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.230\nI can actually sync directly between\nmy Mac Mini and this machine, so\n\n127\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.010\nit's asking for\nthe password to unlock that.\n\n128\n00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.724\nI use a different password on my Mac Mini\nin there, so I'm gonna come in and\n\n129\n00:05:40.724 --> 00:05:41.796\npunch that one.\n\n130\n00:05:41.796 --> 00:05:46.441\nThis would not happen if it was the very\nfirst Mac you had signed in on.\n\n131\n00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:50.599\nBut if you had previous ones, like I do,\nthen you do actually have to come in and\n\n132\n00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:51.300\nspecify it.\n\n133\n00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.190\nSo I'll punch in the right password for\nthat one.\n\n134\n00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.360\nAnd I'm one of those crazy people that has\na different password on every computer,\n\n135\n00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.540\nwhich is probably unnecessary security.\n\n136\n00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.000\nBut anyway,\n\n137\n00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.020\nonce that's done, now it's gonna start\ngoing to what Zach originally asked me.\n\n138\n00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.280\nThis is, like, the longest answer for\n\n139\n00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.310\na short question-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n140\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.140\n&gt;&gt; Where he was asking,\n\n141\n00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.870\nwhat can I synchronize with iCloud?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, what?\n\n142\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.950\n&gt;&gt; And right here it's saying,\n\n143\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.050\ndo I wanna use iCloud from\nmy document to my data.\n\n144\n00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.510\nMy contacts, calendars, reminders,\nnotes, bookmarks, documents,\n\n145\n00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.460\npasswords all uploaded.\n\n146\n00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.170\nIt's a lot.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n147\n00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.920\n&gt;&gt; Lotta stuff.\n\n148\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.570\nRight?\n\n149\n00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.970\nUsually I just leave these checked and\nhit Next.\n\n150\n00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.520\nIn a moment, we'll see a screen where\nwe can actually pick and choose.\n\n151\n00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.540\nCuz maybe I don't want\nall of these things.\n\n152\n00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.035\nI can pick and choose what I want.\n\n153\n00:06:33.035 --> 00:06:36.843\nOr if you want to have total control,\nyou can uncheck all of these,\n\n154\n00:06:36.843 --> 00:06:39.299\nyou don't have to sync anything, right?\n\n155\n00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:43.838\nAnd now when I go forward I'll\nbe able to pick and choose.\n\n156\n00:06:43.838 --> 00:06:47.673\nAnd so here,\nnow I'm actually seeing my iCloud account,\n\n157\n00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:51.052\nit got my picture,\nit pulled that from my Apple ID.\n\n158\n00:06:51.052 --> 00:06:54.866\nAnd I can see all the different things\nthat I can choose to synchronize\n\n159\n00:06:54.866 --> 00:06:55.550\nif I want.\n\n160\n00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.170\nOne of those options is my iCloud drive.\n\n161\n00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.730\nMy iCloud drive is storage that's\nsynchronized between all my machines.\n\n162\n00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.180\nThat's usually a good idea.\n\n163\n00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.410\nI'm editing a document here,\nI can go to my Mac mini and\n\n164\n00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.300\nthe document will be there and vice versa.\n\n165\n00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.650\nIt can go back and forth.\n\n166\n00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.340\nMy photos, I can take a picture on my\nphone, it can show up on my desktop.\n\n167\n00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.150\nIt's in each place.\n\n168\n00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.180\nMy email, contact, calendars,\n\n169\n00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.780\nreminders, my Safari bookmarks, we just go\nright down the list and pick what we want.\n\n170\n00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.610\nI want my iCloud drive,\nI'll check that off.\n\n171\n00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.950\nAnd then I want my Safari and my notes.\n\n172\n00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.575\nI'm just checking each one that I want.\n\n173\n00:07:29.575 --> 00:07:32.022\nAnd when I check it,\nit kinda pauses for a second,\n\n174\n00:07:32.022 --> 00:07:34.137\nthat's it talking back to Apple servers.\n\n175\n00:07:34.137 --> 00:07:39.620\nTo say I wanna connect that and\nit's adding each individual one, right?\n\n176\n00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.690\nSome of them like Siri and\nthe key chain turn on by default.\n\n177\n00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.710\nI didn't select those a minute ago,\nbut they are on.\n\n178\n00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.336\nSo they're chosen and they're highlighted.\n\n179\n00:07:47.336 --> 00:07:51.097\nMost of them you just check and\nthat's it, right?\n\n180\n00:07:51.097 --> 00:07:55.595\nBut some of them when you check them\n&gt;&gt; A little options button appears.\n\n181\n00:07:55.595 --> 00:07:57.716\nAnd the options button is kinda important.\n\n182\n00:07:57.716 --> 00:08:00.846\nIf you hit the options button,\nIt will give you some more\n\n183\n00:08:00.846 --> 00:08:04.043\ndetailed information and\nin the case of my iCloud drive,\n\n184\n00:08:04.043 --> 00:08:06.857\nit's asking what I wanna\nput in the iCloud Drive.\n\n185\n00:08:06.857 --> 00:08:11.130\nDo I want my TextEdit file, Script Editor,\nQuickTime Player and so on.\n\n186\n00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.170\nSome of these I may want,\nsome of them may be not.\n\n187\n00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.120\nI don't want my QuickTime Player,\ncuz video files are big,\n\n188\n00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.640\nthey'll fill up my iCloud Drive.\n\n189\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.035\nI don't want my Documents Folder,\nI know most people do.\n\n190\n00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:25.341\nI run n VMware Fusion and it's putting\nvirtual machines in my Documents Folder.\n\n191\n00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:28.138\nI don't wanna synchronize virtual\nmachines between my systems.\n\n192\n00:08:28.138 --> 00:08:30.072\nI really need to get those out\nof my documents folder, but\n\n193\n00:08:30.072 --> 00:08:31.220\nthat's where they are.\n\n194\n00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.430\nYou can start to pick and\n\n195\n00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:36.590\nchoose what it is that's being\nsynchronized inside of your iCloud Drive.\n\n196\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.914\nAnd you can specify all sorts of really\ninteresting things in here to be able\n\n197\n00:08:39.914 --> 00:08:41.198\nto sync and get put in place.\n\n198\n00:08:41.198 --> 00:08:42.656\nAnd then it warns you down here,\n\n199\n00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:45.859\nthe full contents of the iCloud Drive\nwill be stored on this computer.\n\n200\n00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:48.880\nIt's gonna download all of it,\nunless there's not enough room.\n\n201\n00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.355\nAnd then it's gonna base it on what\nhas been accessed recently and\n\n202\n00:08:52.355 --> 00:08:56.288\ntry to keep the recent stuff local,\nso that you have access to it, right?\n\n203\n00:08:56.288 --> 00:08:59.438\nWhen that's done,\nnow we're connected to the iCloud and\n\n204\n00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:01.307\nwe're synchronizing that data.\n\n205\n00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:04.825\nAnd so I've got common elements being\nshared between those machines and that\n\n206\n00:09:04.825 --> 00:09:08.600\nmakes life easier on us as an end user.\n&gt;&gt; Don, are there security features to\n\n207\n00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.585\nprotect our data?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\n\n208\n00:09:10.585 --> 00:09:12.393\nthat's the real value of iCloud.\n\n209\n00:09:12.393 --> 00:09:15.578\niCloud is designed not so much just to\ngive you little bells and whistles, but\n\n210\n00:09:15.578 --> 00:09:16.515\nto give you security.\n\n211\n00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:19.322\nThat if I lose my Mac,\nif it's stolen, or it breaks, and\n\n212\n00:09:19.322 --> 00:09:22.264\nmy data is synchronized in iCloud,\nI'll be able to get it.\n\n213\n00:09:22.264 --> 00:09:24.865\nBut I don't want attackers\nto be able to get to\n\n214\n00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:25.394\nit.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n215\n00:09:25.394 --> 00:09:26.045\nno, no.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n216\n00:09:26.045 --> 00:09:28.158\nso we have things like dual\nfactor authentication,\n\n217\n00:09:28.158 --> 00:09:30.460\nwhich you can set up on\nyour account details.\n\n218\n00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.140\nBut we also have some other features,\n\n219\n00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.020\ndown here towards the bottom,\nI didn't really mention them.\n\n220\n00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.637\nBut you'll see a feature\ncalled Find My Mac, okay?\n\n221\n00:09:39.637 --> 00:09:44.632\nIf you have an iPhone or\na Macbook or a iMac, Mac mini,\n\n222\n00:09:44.632 --> 00:09:47.638\nwhatever, and it gets stolen.\n\n223\n00:09:47.638 --> 00:09:51.636\nOr you set it down somewhere, and\nyou can't remember where you set it down.\n\n224\n00:09:51.636 --> 00:09:55.313\nIf you have Find My Mac turned on,\nyou'll be able to try and\n\n225\n00:09:55.313 --> 00:09:57.201\nlocate where that device is.\n\n226\n00:09:57.201 --> 00:10:00.488\nNow on an iPhone it works really well,\ncuz they have a GPS built into them, and\n\n227\n00:10:00.488 --> 00:10:02.274\nthey can talk over the cellular network.\n\n228\n00:10:02.274 --> 00:10:04.452\nYou can almost always find an iPhone.\n\n229\n00:10:04.452 --> 00:10:08.034\nAn iPad may have a cellular connection,\nit may not.\n\n230\n00:10:08.034 --> 00:10:10.784\nBut my Macbook,\nit doesn't have a cellular connection.\n\n231\n00:10:10.784 --> 00:10:12.690\nThere's no way I can find that, right?\n\n232\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.280\nBut if I choose to allow it,\n\n233\n00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.400\nit's gonna pay attention to\nthe wireless network that it's on.\n\n234\n00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.606\nAnd Apple can at least tell me where\nit's at geographically based ont he\n\n235\n00:10:20.606 --> 00:10:21.522\nwireless network.\n\n236\n00:10:21.522 --> 00:10:25.721\nAnd that's helpful because if I can't\nremember, did I leave my laptop at work or\n\n237\n00:10:25.721 --> 00:10:26.225\nat home?\n\n238\n00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:30.755\nI can do Find my Mac, it'll locate\nthe device, and once it finds it,\n\n239\n00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:33.280\nit'll tell me where it's at.\n\n240\n00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.139\nNow when I turn on my Find My Mac,\nsee how mines kinda paused here?\n\n241\n00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:38.320\nI pause for a little bit,\n\n242\n00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.496\nthat's because it's having to turn on some\nlocation services and phone home to Apple.\n\n243\n00:10:42.496 --> 00:10:44.355\nSo it's kinda doing all\nthat in the background.\n\n244\n00:10:44.355 --> 00:10:48.502\nBut once it's in place,\nI'm now running Find My Mac.\n\n245\n00:10:48.502 --> 00:10:51.663\nAnd it's phone home to Apple with\nthe location of this device.\n\n246\n00:10:51.663 --> 00:10:54.520\nNow, I can't see that from right here.\n\n247\n00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.805\nWhat I would have to do,\nis I would have to fire up Safari and\n\n248\n00:10:58.805 --> 00:11:02.747\ngo to the iCloud website,\nyou can go to iCloud.com.\n\n249\n00:11:02.747 --> 00:11:06.425\nAnd on the iCloud website, boy,\nthat is rendering strange.\n\n250\n00:11:06.425 --> 00:11:07.926\n&gt;&gt; That was stranges.\n\n251\n00:11:07.926 --> 00:11:09.238\n&gt;&gt; That was kind of a trippy experience\n\n252\n00:11:09.238 --> 00:11:10.300\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.284\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Once you get into iCloud,\n\n254\n00:11:12.284 --> 00:11:16.639\non iCloud.com, you can log in.\n&gt;&gt; So Don, how actually would I\n\n255\n00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:19.259\nfind that missing device?\n&gt;&gt; Well, so\n\n256\n00:11:19.259 --> 00:11:21.319\nyou can go to really any\ncomputer in the world.\n\n257\n00:11:21.319 --> 00:11:24.287\nAnd you can log into iCloud and look.\n\n258\n00:11:24.287 --> 00:11:25.206\nSo here, I'll show you.\n\n259\n00:11:25.206 --> 00:11:28.318\nInstead of looking from this Mac here,\nI'll switch over to my actual laptop.\n\n260\n00:11:28.318 --> 00:11:35.200\nAnd if I fire up Safari, I can go to\niCloud.com and I can get logged in.\n\n261\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.075\nAnd so I'll log in with my Apple ID and\nit needs to be the same Apple ID.\n\n262\n00:11:39.075 --> 00:11:43.244\nOr at least in the family account of the\nsame Apple ID to be able to come in and\n\n263\n00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:43.934\nfind that.\n\n264\n00:11:43.934 --> 00:11:49.527\nAnd so I'm gonna get logged in,\nand this is my laptop.\n\n265\n00:11:49.527 --> 00:11:52.975\nIt should have me trusted, so it shouldn't\nprompt me for dual factor on this one.\n\n266\n00:11:52.975 --> 00:11:53.614\nThere we go.\n\n267\n00:11:53.614 --> 00:11:54.333\nAnd I get in.\n\n268\n00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:58.703\nSo here I see my iCloud, and I can go to\nfind iPhone, I know I'm not looking for\n\n269\n00:11:58.703 --> 00:12:01.613\nan iPhone,\nthis actually finds any Apple device.\n\n270\n00:12:01.613 --> 00:12:04.721\nIt was originally an iPhone\nfeature is why it shows up here.\n\n271\n00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:09.654\nAnd I can go in there, and once I go in,\nI can see I've got some green\n\n272\n00:12:09.654 --> 00:12:12.512\ncircles showing up, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n273\n00:12:12.512 --> 00:12:14.268\n&gt;&gt; I've got some devices showing up and\n\n274\n00:12:14.268 --> 00:12:15.519\nI can spot where they are.\n\n275\n00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:18.929\nAnd I can drill into that.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n276\n00:12:18.929 --> 00:12:21.143\n&gt;&gt; And I can find them right here in\n\n277\n00:12:21.143 --> 00:12:22.937\nthe ITPro.TV studios.\n\n278\n00:12:22.937 --> 00:12:27.030\nThis is the ITPro.TV studios, if you ever\npull it up on Google Maps, and here's one.\n\n279\n00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:32.060\nDon's Macbook Pro checked in less than a\nminute ago, it knows where my Macbook is.\n\n280\n00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.972\nMy Macbook doesn't have a GPS in it, but\n\n281\n00:12:34.972 --> 00:12:39.269\nit know that it's on the ITPro.TV\nwireless network here.\n\n282\n00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:42.186\nAnd so\nit's able to say within this green circle,\n\n283\n00:12:42.186 --> 00:12:46.568\nthis is the circle that dictates where\nthat wireless network is detected.\n\n284\n00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:50.533\nThen we should be able to get it and\nI can see right here the building name,\n\n285\n00:12:50.533 --> 00:12:53.062\nwhere we've got the ITPro.TV, right?\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n286\n00:12:53.062 --> 00:12:54.659\n&gt;&gt; So now I know where my device is, and\n\n287\n00:12:54.659 --> 00:12:57.540\nthat's really handy if you're\nworried about losing a device or\n\n288\n00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.405\ntrying to find it.\n\n289\n00:12:58.405 --> 00:13:01.761\nSo if you think it might be stolen or\nyou think it might just be left at home,\n\n290\n00:13:01.761 --> 00:13:03.076\nhere we can go in and find it.\n\n291\n00:13:03.076 --> 00:13:05.357\nAnd iCloud really helps with that.\n&gt;&gt; Don,\n\n292\n00:13:05.357 --> 00:13:09.457\nwhat other features to we get with iCloud?\n&gt;&gt; There's some other neat ones that,\n\n293\n00:13:09.457 --> 00:13:11.045\nI don't know, you may or may not use.\n\n294\n00:13:11.045 --> 00:13:13.372\nFor example, back to my Mac, right?\n\n295\n00:13:13.372 --> 00:13:16.394\nI didn't turn it on,\nlet me go back here in my iCloud settings,\n\n296\n00:13:16.394 --> 00:13:17.429\nit was Back to My Mac.\n\n297\n00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:22.450\nThat let's you remotely access\nthe screen of your Mac, all right?\n\n298\n00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.608\nNow that leverages the screen sharing.\n\n299\n00:13:25.608 --> 00:13:28.754\nIf you never used screen sharing on\nyour Mac, it's probably turned off,\n\n300\n00:13:28.754 --> 00:13:30.033\nmine is actually turned off.\n\n301\n00:13:30.033 --> 00:13:34.187\nIt's warning me, it's saying that I need\nto turn on sharing to access this Mac.\n\n302\n00:13:34.187 --> 00:13:38.481\nWell, the sharing that it's talking\nabout is actually back here.\n\n303\n00:13:38.481 --> 00:13:42.185\nIf I go into my System Preferences and\nI go into Sharing, you'll see all\n\n304\n00:13:42.185 --> 00:13:46.038\nthe different things that you can share\nand one of them is Screen Sharing.\n\n305\n00:13:46.038 --> 00:13:48.643\nIf that's turned off,\nBack to My Mac doesn't work.\n\n306\n00:13:48.643 --> 00:13:52.120\nBut if it was turned on,\nyou can remotely connect to the screen.\n\n307\n00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.360\nNow by default Screen Sharing only\nworks when you're on the same network.\n\n308\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.404\nSo for example, I could screen share with\nZack, or Zack can screen share with me.\n\n309\n00:13:59.404 --> 00:14:01.562\nWe're both here on the same network.\n\n310\n00:14:01.562 --> 00:14:04.926\nBut with Back to My Mac,\nI can be anywhere in the world and\n\n311\n00:14:04.926 --> 00:14:09.239\nconnect across the Internet to be able\nto see the screen of that device.\n\n312\n00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:11.498\nAnd so once I've got that turned on,\nI can go back into iCloud.\n\n313\n00:14:11.498 --> 00:14:16.605\nAnd Back to My Mac its turned on,\nit's not complaining\n\n314\n00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:21.055\nabout the error anymore and\nno its up and going.\n\n315\n00:14:21.055 --> 00:14:23.839\nIn theory,\nlet's say I had four Mac's, right?\n\n316\n00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:27.082\nAnd I had Back to My Mac\nturned on everyone, no matter\n\n317\n00:14:27.082 --> 00:14:31.823\nwhere I was in the entire planet, I should\nbe able to fire up one of my Mac's.\n\n318\n00:14:31.823 --> 00:14:34.476\nI should be able to launch Finder.\n\n319\n00:14:34.476 --> 00:14:39.440\nAnd in the Finder, over here on the left\nside, you've got this shared section,\n\n320\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:39.958\nright?\n\n321\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:44.434\nAnd shared normally is going to show you\nMac's that are on the same network as you.\n\n322\n00:14:44.434 --> 00:14:45.950\nSo I see like Cameron's MacBook Pro.\n\n323\n00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.121\nWell Cameron is like three walls over,\nhe's over that way.\n\n324\n00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:51.163\nHe's in the building with us, right?\n\n325\n00:14:51.163 --> 00:14:54.541\nBut if I got to the airport,\nI'm not going to see Cameron anymore.\n\n326\n00:14:54.541 --> 00:14:57.753\nHe's not three walls away anymore,\nhe's a 100 miles away.\n\n327\n00:14:57.753 --> 00:15:05.126\nBut Don's MacBook Pro or Don's Mac mini or\nwhatever, those should always show up.\n\n328\n00:15:05.126 --> 00:15:10.232\nThey're there, because I'm finding them\nvia iCloud, not via the local network.\n\n329\n00:15:10.232 --> 00:15:15.797\nAnd I can choose that machine, and\nthen I can hit Share Screen right here.\n\n330\n00:15:15.797 --> 00:15:19.690\nAnd that'll connect that device and\nshow me what's on its screen.\n\n331\n00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.685\nAnd I can actually sit there and\nwork as if I was sitting at that Mac.\n\n332\n00:15:22.685 --> 00:15:24.506\nNow I don't wanna do my Mac Pro.\n\n333\n00:15:24.506 --> 00:15:29.165\nI'm in a virtual machine, and I'd be\neffectively viewing my actual desktop, so\n\n334\n00:15:29.165 --> 00:15:30.319\nI don't want that.\n\n335\n00:15:30.319 --> 00:15:35.865\nBut I could, I guess do it the other\nway around from my actual Macbook,\n\n336\n00:15:35.865 --> 00:15:38.029\nI could come down and look.\n\n337\n00:15:38.029 --> 00:15:42.238\nAnd there's Don's Mac showing up, that's\nthat vitual machine popping up right\n\n338\n00:15:42.238 --> 00:15:44.625\nthere, and\nI could chose Don's Plex Server.\n\n339\n00:15:44.625 --> 00:15:49.752\nThat's actually a machine that I have at\nhome that I store my television shows on.\n\n340\n00:15:49.752 --> 00:15:51.572\nSo I can connect and view its screen.\n\n341\n00:15:51.572 --> 00:15:57.269\nBut I see Don's Mac, I can click on it and\nthen I got Share Screen that I can hit.\n\n342\n00:15:57.269 --> 00:16:00.634\nAnd I haven't tested it on this one yet,\nlet's see if it works.\n\n343\n00:16:00.634 --> 00:16:02.321\nI'm gonna try and\nconnect, and there we go.\n\n344\n00:16:02.321 --> 00:16:04.225\nIt's just asking me to provide a name.\n\n345\n00:16:04.225 --> 00:16:09.640\nMy username on that system is just\nDon Pezet and I'll punch in my password.\n\n346\n00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.040\nAnd I'll connect, and\nit's talking to that Mac.\n\n347\n00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.320\nAnd assuming it can connect,\nit should display up the screen.\n\n348\n00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.080\nI should be able to connect.\n\n349\n00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.970\nThere we go.\nAnd now ,I'm on my MacBook, and\n\n350\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:25.270\nwhen I see that virtual machine, and\nI can get in here and mess around with it.\n\n351\n00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.470\nAnd it's like I'm sitting at it.\n\n352\n00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.490\nNow, it's just a virtual machine.\n\n353\n00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:29.220\nIf I switch over here,\n\n354\n00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.100\nhere is the virtual machine.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n355\n00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.070\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\n\n356\n00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:36.740\nif I fire up Safari and I come back over\nhere, I see that Safari has launched.\n\n357\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.230\nSo you can work just like you're seeing.\n\n358\n00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.700\nThat's Back to My Mac.\n\n359\n00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.850\nIt's a feature of iCloud, but\nit doesn't work from the iCloud webpage.\n\n360\n00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.510\nYou have to launch this from another Mac.\n\n361\n00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.840\nSo if you only have one Mac,\nthat Linux kinda useless.\n\n362\n00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.670\nBut if you have two Macs,\nlike a laptop and\n\n363\n00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.720\na desktop then it becomes really,\nreally handy.\n\n364\n00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.695\nAnd I use this with my\npluck server all the time.\n\n365\n00:16:57.695 --> 00:17:00.280\nCuzI don't even have a monitor\nattached to my pluck server.\n\n366\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.710\nJust, I fire up my MacBook.\n\n367\n00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:03.960\nThen I cup and see a screen.\n\n368\n00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.960\nThen I can work with it.\n&gt;&gt; What if we use a non Apple router?\n\n369\n00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.760\n&gt;&gt; Non Apple routers can cause a problem.\n\n370\n00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.960\nIn fact, here in the building\nwe have a non Apple router.\n\n371\n00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.450\nAnd this worked,\nwhich is kinda surprising.\n\n372\n00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:19.880\nSo in order for Back to My Mac to work it\nhas to open up some ports on your router,\n\n373\n00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.570\nreally on your firewall, right?\n\n374\n00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:24.420\nAnd some routers and\nfirewalls are really happy with that.\n\n375\n00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.400\nIf you have an Apple AirPort\nit works no problem, right?\n\n376\n00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:33.190\nThose are pretty straightforward, even an\nApple Time Capsule will do it, no problem.\n\n377\n00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.982\nBut if you've got Google Wi-Fi or\n\n378\n00:17:36.982 --> 00:17:41.450\nCisco ASA, Linksys router.\n\n379\n00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.815\nThey can start to mess with\nthis getting through and\n\n380\n00:17:44.815 --> 00:17:47.100\nthere's a series of ports\nthat need to be open.\n\n381\n00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.650\nI'll put them in the show\nnotes if you need them or\n\n382\n00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.480\nyou can find them on Apple support site.\n\n383\n00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.878\nThey need to be open.\n\n384\n00:17:51.878 --> 00:17:56.811\nWell, the Macs they support a protocol\ncall UPnP or Universal Plug and Play.\n\n385\n00:17:56.811 --> 00:18:00.250\nWhere they'll talk to the router and say,\nhey, can you open up these ports for me?\n\n386\n00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.570\nAnd most routers will say, hey,\nthat's fine, I'll do it, right?\n\n387\n00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.690\nBut if they don't,\nit might cuz back to my Mac not to work.\n\n388\n00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:11.230\nAnd you might remember me saying a moment\nago, I didn't test this before the show,\n\n389\n00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.250\nI hope it works.\n\n390\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.910\nSometimes it doesn't work, right?\n\n391\n00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.350\nIn fact, when I configured this.\n\n392\n00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.490\nLet me get out of screen sharing here and\nget back to my actual machine.\n\n393\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:23.260\nBack here in the actual machine,\nwhen I turned on Back to My Mac,\n\n394\n00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.420\nit was complaining about\nscreen sharing not being on.\n\n395\n00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.576\nI fixed that.\n\n396\n00:18:26.576 --> 00:18:30.001\nAnd then it says, set up router for\nbetter performance.\n\n397\n00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:31.340\nWhat does that mean?\n\n398\n00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.600\nThat means that some of the ports\nmay be blocked right now.\n\n399\n00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.510\nUntil it's warning me if I hit details,\nit's gonna tell me about that.\n\n400\n00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.930\nIt's gonna say, hey we have UPnP support.\n\n401\n00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:47.530\nAnd if you can turn that on in router,\nit will open up those ports and\n\n402\n00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.100\nallow this communication through.\n\n403\n00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.140\nBut if it's turned off on your router,\nthis may or may not work.\n\n404\n00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.410\nAnd so\nwe get a little bit of caution there.\n\n405\n00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.140\nUPnP is the easiest way to solve this, but\n\n406\n00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.800\nin a high security environment\nthey don't like UPnP.\n\n407\n00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.887\nSo then you would even\nmanually set up a port.\n\n408\n00:19:02.887 --> 00:19:06.004\nAnd I'll put the link to\nApple Support documentation on that.\n\n409\n00:19:06.004 --> 00:19:10.880\nSo you can see what port numbers you\nneed to open and import to a router.\n\n410\n00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.400\nSo that's all just kinda\nfunctionality of this right there.\n\n411\n00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.660\nAs part of Back to My Mac.\n&gt;&gt; Is there anything else that can get in\n\n412\n00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:22.390\nthe way of iCloud, Don?\n&gt;&gt; The main thing on the router side, if\n\n413\n00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:27.510\nyou got UPnP, you're in pretty good shape,\nbut basic networking can be a problem.\n\n414\n00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.320\nSome ISPs can filter traffic.\n\n415\n00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.550\nAnd then firewalls.\n\n416\n00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.220\nFirewalls can really get in there and\nmess with things.\n\n417\n00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.770\nSo you got to be careful there.\n\n418\n00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.280\nAnother option to help with this,\n\n419\n00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.070\nto make sure you get the most\nlikely connection, is to use a VPN.\n\n420\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.990\nIf you use a VPN, you can connect\ninto your office or your home and\n\n421\n00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.740\nit looks like your on the same network.\n\n422\n00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.150\nNow the router doesn't\nhave to get involved.\n\n423\n00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.590\nThe firewall doesn't have to get\ninvolved that can solve that problem.\n\n424\n00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.935\nBut Apple doesn't offer a VPN service, so\n\n425\n00:19:53.935 --> 00:19:57.007\nit's up to you to find some\nother option for doing that.\n\n426\n00:19:57.007 --> 00:20:00.313\nA lot of routers these days have\nVPN functionality built into them.\n\n427\n00:20:00.313 --> 00:20:04.501\nOr you can use software\nVPNs like zero tier or or\n\n428\n00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:07.158\nany of a number of other products.\n\n429\n00:20:07.158 --> 00:20:10.590\nThey all work, but\nthose are probably the main things.\n\n430\n00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.189\nThere is one last thing that I want to\npoint out that I bumped into this just\n\n431\n00:20:14.189 --> 00:20:15.728\na few times, not very common.\n\n432\n00:20:15.728 --> 00:20:20.689\nIn my system preferences,\nif I go to security and privacy,\n\n433\n00:20:20.689 --> 00:20:25.665\ninside of security and privacy,\nthere's a firewall tab.\n\n434\n00:20:25.665 --> 00:20:29.193\nThere's a firewall built in to Mac OS.\n\n435\n00:20:29.193 --> 00:20:32.970\nBut it is turned off by default, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n436\n00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:37.962\n&gt;&gt; If I unlock this page, It'll\n\n437\n00:20:37.962 --> 00:20:40.862\nlet me in here and\nyou'll see where it's off by default.\n\n438\n00:20:40.862 --> 00:20:42.628\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n439\n00:20:42.628 --> 00:20:43.702\n&gt;&gt; If that's the case,\n\n440\n00:20:43.702 --> 00:20:47.174\nBack to My Mac will work fine,\nall the other features will work fine.\n\n441\n00:20:47.174 --> 00:20:51.722\nBut if you've turned that on, not only do\nwe have to worry about network firewalls,\n\n442\n00:20:51.722 --> 00:20:54.380\nwe have to worry about this firewall also.\n\n443\n00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.460\nAnd this one could be blocking Back\nto My Mac as well as all the other\n\n444\n00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.310\niCloud services.\n\n445\n00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:59.730\nIt could really block anything.\n\n446\n00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:05.140\nSo if you've turned this firewall on you\nneed to come into the firewall options and\n\n447\n00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.200\nyou need to make sure that\nscreen sharing is allowed.\n\n448\n00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.650\nBut if you've turned on block\nall incoming connections,\n\n449\n00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.910\nScreen Sharing is not gonna work.\n\n450\n00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:16.690\nSo you may need to come in here and\nadd rules for that.\n\n451\n00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:20.450\nIf you're in stealth mode,\nthen Screen Sharing is not gonna work.\n\n452\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.144\nThese are ways that you might break it.\n\n453\n00:21:22.144 --> 00:21:23.639\nBut this is off by default,\n\n454\n00:21:23.639 --> 00:21:27.419\nso this would only be if you had\nturned on the firewall in your system.\n\n455\n00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:28.859\nYou would need to make\nsure those rules were\n\n456\n00:21:28.859 --> 00:21:31.000\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n457\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.620\nWonderful episode, using iCloud, loved it.\n\n458\n00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.110\nDon, anything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; One\n\n459\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.710\nlast thing I do wanna\nmention on the iPod storage.\n\n460\n00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.430\nYou get five gigs of storage free.\n\n461\n00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.910\nWhich is a like a pittance.\n\n462\n00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.890\nThat is just such a small,\nsmall amount of information.\n\n463\n00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.790\nIf you have even one iPhone\non your iCloud account,\n\n464\n00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.110\nyou've probably already used up all\nthat space with photos and backups.\n\n465\n00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.500\nSo you may need to pay to\nincrease the storage limits and\n\n466\n00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.900\nApple storage rates are not\ncompetitive with the market.\n\n467\n00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.410\nSo you might wannna disable file\nsynchronization to iCloud and\n\n468\n00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:06.610\nuse a third-party one,\nbecause it's far more economical.\n\n469\n00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.960\nBut just be aware that\nwhile iCloud is free,\n\n470\n00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.470\nthey don't give you a ton of storage and\nthat's usually how they make money on\n\n471\n00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.317\niCloud.\n&gt;&gt; Great, great information, Don,\n\n472\n00:22:16.317 --> 00:22:18.068\nonce again, well-delivered.\n\n473\n00:22:18.068 --> 00:22:21.147\nApple certified support\nprofessional is a fabulous series,\n\n474\n00:22:21.147 --> 00:22:24.177\nmake sure you see every episode,\nyou'll be so glad you did.\n\n475\n00:22:24.177 --> 00:22:28.130\nAnd you'll be in the course library too,\nwhere there is thousands of other videos\n\n476\n00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.130\ndesigned to do one thing,\nto help you go further.\n\n477\n00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:35.370\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nITPro.TV, ITPro.TV is binge worthy.\n\n478\n00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.753\nThanks for watching I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n479\n00:22:37.753 --> 00:22:38.835\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n480\n00:22:38.835 --> 00:22:46.178\n[MUSIC]\n\n481\n00:22:46.178 --> 00:22:48.628\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

You're\n\n4\n00:00:09.115 --> 00:00:12.745\nwatching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for watching.\n\n5\n00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:16.375\nWatching ITProTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:17.645\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:17.645 --> 00:00:20.645\nAs we continue on with\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n8\n00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:23.135\nThis is Peripheral Devices this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:24.265\nWhat's that all about?\n\n10\n00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:25.845\nWell let's find out, shall we?\n\n11\n00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:27.635\nAnd Don Pezet's gonna\nhelp us out with that.\n\n12\n00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:29.825\nDon, good to see you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; And thanks for having me back, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:31.685\nAnd we're gonna look at\nperipheral devices here.\n\n14\n00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:35.540\nWhich are ways that we can extend\nout the functionality of our Mac.\n\n15\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.890\nMac OS is a very powerful\noperating system.\n\n16\n00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.250\nYour hardware is very powerful hardware.\n\n17\n00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.560\nBut when you buy it, it only has so\nmuch stuff jammed in under the hood.\n\n18\n00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.310\nAnd odds are, sooner or later, you're\ngonna find something that's missing.\n\n19\n00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.250\nFor example, Apple has neglected to build\na printer into any of their devices.\n\n20\n00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.790\nAnd so at some point you might\nneed to print something.\n\n21\n00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.360\nNow we've gotta add that\nfunctionality to our system.\n\n22\n00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.140\nSo fortunately,\nwe have a wide range of support for\n\n23\n00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.300\nperipheral devices, and in this episode,\nwe're gonna look at that.\n\n24\n00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.810\nWe'll talk about some of\nthe devices we can stick on.\n\n25\n00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.730\nHow we can use them,\nwhat we can make use of.\n\n26\n00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.690\nAnd some of the variations of\nthe ports that are available\n\n27\n00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.740\nthat are gonna impact what we can\nconnect and what we can't connect.\n\n28\n00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.960\nSo all of that right here in this episode.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n29\n00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.496\nwhat types of devices does MacOS support?\n&gt;&gt; All right so\n\n30\n00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.719\nI gave an example of like a printer right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n31\n00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.179\n&gt;&gt; But it's really it's a huge,\n\n32\n00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:24.775\nlong list of things.\n\n33\n00:01:24.775 --> 00:01:26.405\nWe'll use my Macbook as an example.\n\n34\n00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:30.455\nSo, my Macbook is nice,\nit's got a nice screen on it,\n\n35\n00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:36.035\nit's got wi-fi built into it,\nit has a hard drive.\n\n36\n00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:37.375\nBasic stuff, right?\n\n37\n00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:39.575\nBut there's many things\nthat it is missing.\n\n38\n00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:42.440\nSo for\nexample it's only got one hard drive.\n\n39\n00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.120\nWouldn't it be nice if I had a second hard\ndrive so I could run time machine and\n\n40\n00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.130\nget back-ups?\n\n41\n00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.780\nIt has a wireless network adapter, but\nit doesn't have a wired network adapter.\n\n42\n00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.910\nWouldn't it be nice if I could have\na wired network adapter connected and\n\n43\n00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.900\nplugged in?\n\n44\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.550\nWouldn't it be nice if I had\na printer that I could print to.\n\n45\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.620\nOr maybe I'm an architect and\nI need a plotter, you know,\n\n46\n00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.230\none of those really big printers.\n\n47\n00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.500\nA scanner to be able to scan documents and\nget it in here.\n\n48\n00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.560\nIt's got a web cam in the monitor,\nbut the web cam is built in.\n\n49\n00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.540\nAnd so, when I lean the monitor back, now\nthe web cam is pointing right up my nose,\n\n50\n00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.215\nwhich is not a great Facetime experience.\n&gt;&gt; Not a great place to be.\n\n51\n00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:15.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n52\n00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.040\nwouldn't it be nice if it\nhad an external web camera.\n\n53\n00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.220\nThat I could stick on here and\nangle so it's not looking up my nose.\n\n54\n00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.460\nThose are all things, that,\nif you are saying those,\n\n55\n00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.940\nyou are not the first person to say them,\nright?\n\n56\n00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.180\nTons of people feel exactly the same way.\n\n57\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.890\nWouldn't it be nice if\nthat this extra stuff, but\n\n58\n00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.110\nnot everyone is saying the same thing.\n\n59\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.710\nI might say, boy I wish I had a camera\nthat didn't look up my nose But\n\n60\n00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.000\nZack might say, I never use the camera.\n\n61\n00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.556\nWhat do I care?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n62\n00:02:45.556 --> 00:02:47.290\n&gt;&gt; Different people have different needs.\n\n63\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.400\nSo when Apple specs out the hardware,\nthey try and\n\n64\n00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.390\nmake it where it meets\nthe most common needs.\n\n65\n00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.720\nThey call it the lowest common denominator\nor functionality that every user needs.\n\n66\n00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.570\nAnd then it's up to you to figure out\nwhat you wanna add on to make it better.\n\n67\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.310\nNow that's changed a lot in recent years.\n\n68\n00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.580\nIn older system, like my Mac mini\nthat's on my desk in the office.\n\n69\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.419\nIt has all sorts of ports\nthat are attached to it that\n\n70\n00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.072\nare design connect a ton\nof different devices.\n\n71\n00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:23.250\nMeanwhile my MacBook Pro now just\nhave USBC ports and that's it.\n\n72\n00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.650\nAnd so if I want to plug something in,\n\n73\n00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.890\nit's gonna have to support USBC\nin order for me to plug it in.\n\n74\n00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.730\nAnd that's gonna limit\nthe devices that I connect.\n\n75\n00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.795\nBut not even thinking about that,\nthough, just thinking general devices,\n\n76\n00:03:36.795 --> 00:03:38.119\nthere's tons of stuff.\n\n77\n00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:42.194\nPrinters, monitors, mice, keyboards,\nscanners, joysticks, hard drives,\n\n78\n00:03:42.194 --> 00:03:42.922\ntape drives.\n\n79\n00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:43.868\nPeople use them.\n\n80\n00:03:43.868 --> 00:03:46.651\nNetwork adapters, sound cards,\ndocking stations.\n\n81\n00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:51.940\nAll sorts of hardware like that, that we\ncan stick on to the outside of our Mac.\n\n82\n00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.496\nAnd now we've got more functionality\nthan we did when we first bought\n\n83\n00:03:55.496 --> 00:03:58.260\nthe thing.\n&gt;&gt; What connection methods does Mac OS\n\n84\n00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.390\nsupport?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n85\n00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.620\nI mentioned USBC and that's because it's\nfirst and foremost in my mind right now.\n\n86\n00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.500\nOn my laptop I just have USBC and\nthat's it.\n\n87\n00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.540\nBut on my old Mac Book Pro,\nI had USB 3.0 ports.\n\n88\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.260\nI had display port connections.\n\n89\n00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.400\nI had Thunderbolt 2,\nThunderbolt 3 is built into USBC.\n\n90\n00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.890\nSo I had those ports, I had a couple of,\nI had a memory card reader.\n\n91\n00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.310\nAn SD card and a Micro SD card\nreader that you could pop in and\n\n92\n00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.510\nread those,\nall built right in to the MacBook.\n\n93\n00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.670\nBut if you go even older, right,\nstart reaching back a little bit.\n\n94\n00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.710\nGo back to some of the iMacs or\nthe original Mac Minis.\n\n95\n00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.010\nThey had a CD and optical drive that you\ncould pop in and start to read the disk.\n\n96\n00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.990\nSo they had more things built in to it,\nbut they also had more ports.\n\n97\n00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.640\nRight, they had fire wire ports\nto be able to plug things in.\n\n98\n00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.510\nNow you might ask yourself,\nwhy does Apple keep changing the ports?\n\n99\n00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.760\nWhy do we have to keep buying new hardware\nevery time a new version comes out?\n\n100\n00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.720\nAnd what it boils down to is\nusually speed, all right.\n\n101\n00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.290\nNow I don't want to turn this\ninto an engineering show and\n\n102\n00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.590\nfocus too much on how each\nindividual port works.\n\n103\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.170\nIf you wanna learn more about\nhow the ports themselves work.\n\n104\n00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.710\nI definitely encourage you to\njump over to our A plus training.\n\n105\n00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.630\nWhere Wes on our A plus shows.\n\n106\n00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.562\nI mean he goes deep diving.\n&gt;&gt; Yes he does.\n\n107\n00:05:15.562 --> 00:05:16.450\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna be port.\n\n108\n00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.860\nBut let me just do a quick\nsummary here for you.\n\n109\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.910\nFireWire.\n\n110\n00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.590\nFireWire at its fastest speed runs\nat about 800 mega bits per second.\n\n111\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.110\nRight?\n\n112\n00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.190\nSo if I have a hard drive hooked up or\na scanner or a camera or\n\n113\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.020\nwhatever hooked up via FireWire.\n\n114\n00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.260\nI'm gonna get about 800 megabits\nat best of throughput on that.\n\n115\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.730\nIt's pretty decent, right?\n\n116\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.210\nBut it's not great.\n\n117\n00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.388\nUSB 3.0, or now, USB 3.1.\n\n118\n00:05:39.388 --> 00:05:45.800\nUSB 3.1 ports, those can move\nup to 5 gigabits per second.\n\n119\n00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.310\nThat's a lot more.\n\n120\n00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.290\nThat's six times what you\ncan get out of FireWire.\n\n121\n00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.670\nIt's faster.\n\n122\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.470\nSo why keep FireWire around if I've\ngot a better technology that's faster?\n\n123\n00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.350\nAnd that's what Apple does,\nthey move to the faster one, USBC.\n\n124\n00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.920\nWhich has USB 3.1 built into it and\nit has Thunderbolt 3 built into it.\n\n125\n00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.110\nWell, in the USBC mode,\nyou can get up to 5 gigabits.\n\n126\n00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.570\nIn Thunderbolt mode If you have\nThunderbolt 3 with full compatibility,\n\n127\n00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.322\nyou can get up to 40 gigabits per second.\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n128\n00:06:16.322 --> 00:06:19.221\n&gt;&gt; Which is almost illegal in how fast it\n\n129\n00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:21.480\nis.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Very much illegal.\n\n130\n00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.740\n&gt;&gt; I can say that today,\n\n131\n00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.760\nfive years from now, I'll be like, aw,\n\n132\n00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.143\nthis is crappy Thunderbolt 3?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n133\n00:06:26.143 --> 00:06:27.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 40 gigabit?\n\n134\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.170\nWhat is this, 1997?\n\n135\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.620\nSo anyhow,\nit is all about perspective I suppose.\n\n136\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.920\nBut, things get faster.\n\n137\n00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.860\nIt has happened over time.\n\n138\n00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.750\nThunderbolt 1 was 10 GB.\n\n139\n00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.400\nThunderbolt 2 was 20 GB and\nThunderbolt 3 is now 40 GB.\n\n140\n00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.860\nSo as Apple upgrades to\nadd the latest hardware.\n\n141\n00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.730\nUnfortunately the ports change.\n\n142\n00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.990\nSo I can't just give you this\nfixed value and say yeah,\n\n143\n00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.300\nyou're gonna have four USB ports.\n\n144\n00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.410\nAnd you're gonna have two display ports.\n\n145\n00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.860\nBecause I don't know.\n\n146\n00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.650\nDepending on the Mac Mini you buy,\nor the iMac, or the Mac Pro,\n\n147\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.830\nyou're gonna see different ports.\n\n148\n00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.570\nSo you'll need to look\nat the specifications.\n\n149\n00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.120\nOr if you already have the device,\njust pick it up and look at it.\n\n150\n00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.700\nBut be careful because some of\nthe newer devices like my MacBook Pro.\n\n151\n00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.930\nWhich I didn't go bottom of the line,\n\n152\n00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.530\nactually I did pass on the touch\nbar because I thought it was silly.\n\n153\n00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.770\nWhich turns out to be\na little bit of a mistake.\n\n154\n00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:26.380\nIf you get the touch bar, then your\nlaptop will have four USBC ports, whoa.\n\n155\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.680\nBut if you don't get the touch bar,\nlike I did, you only get two USBC ports.\n\n156\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.890\nSo on my entire Macbook if I look\naround the edges of this thing.\n\n157\n00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.380\nI start kind of poking around on it.\n\n158\n00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.810\nThere's only three holes in\nthe outside of this thing.\n\n159\n00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:46.130\nI have two USB C ports on one side and\nI have a headphone jack on the other side.\n\n160\n00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.140\nAnd if Johnny Eyes gets his hands on this,\nthat headphone jack is gone.\n\n161\n00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.530\nIn the next version of the Macbook,\nI doubt that will be there, right?\n\n162\n00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.710\nThey have Bluetooth,\nthey have wireless connectivity.\n\n163\n00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.569\nThat is the way a lot\nof devices have gone.\n\n164\n00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:00.684\nSo you may only have\nUSBC on your device and\n\n165\n00:08:00.684 --> 00:08:05.777\nthat is not necessarily a bad thing.\n&gt;&gt; But it means that in order to\n\n166\n00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:11.043\nconnect other devices,\nyou might need to leverage a dongle.\n\n167\n00:08:11.043 --> 00:08:13.250\nAnd people call this Donglegate,\nbut it's not just Apple.\n\n168\n00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.247\nEvery vendor is going\nthrough this right now.\n\n169\n00:08:15.247 --> 00:08:19.357\nFor example, I've actually got one\nattached to my system right now,\n\n170\n00:08:19.357 --> 00:08:20.310\nthis thing.\n\n171\n00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.516\nSo this is the official Apple\nmultimedia dongle for the MacBook Pro,\n\n172\n00:08:24.516 --> 00:08:26.340\nwhich I unfortunately need.\n\n173\n00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.830\nAnd that's because if you need other\nports, well, this will give it to you.\n\n174\n00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.801\nIts got USBC on one end.\n\n175\n00:08:32.801 --> 00:08:35.550\nAnd so I plugged that into\na USBC port on my laptop.\n\n176\n00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.855\nAnd then on the other side,\n\n177\n00:08:37.855 --> 00:08:42.575\nit has a traditional USB port\nright here which is USB3.\n\n178\n00:08:42.575 --> 00:08:46.572\nThen it's got an HDMI port right here for\nhooking up an external monitor and\n\n179\n00:08:46.572 --> 00:08:49.880\nthen it's got a USBC port\nhere with power pass through.\n\n180\n00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.883\nSo I can plug my charger in, a monitor\nin and then a USB hub is what I normally\n\n181\n00:08:53.883 --> 00:08:58.425\nplugin like when I'm back in my office and\nI get all these other USB devices on them.\n\n182\n00:08:58.425 --> 00:09:00.925\nThere's a company called HyperDrive\nthat makes something similar to this,\n\n183\n00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:02.200\nexcept it's got even more ports on it.\n\n184\n00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.371\nIt's got multiple USB ports and\nit's got an SD card reader.\n\n185\n00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:07.380\nAnd so you can get those and\nstick them on.\n\n186\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.435\nSo even if you have limited ports,\nyou can still kinda work around it.\n\n187\n00:09:11.435 --> 00:09:15.855\nYou just have to know what adaptors you're\ngoing to need to buy to hook up those\n\n188\n00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:16.469\ndevices.\n\n189\n00:09:16.469 --> 00:09:20.080\nThe exception to all of this\nis really gonna be fire wire.\n\n190\n00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.562\nNo Mac has a fire wire port anymore.\n\n191\n00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.401\nAll the Macs that are sold\ntoday do not have fire wire and\n\n192\n00:09:25.401 --> 00:09:27.390\nthey don't make fire wire adapters.\n\n193\n00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.333\nIt's not something you can just do\na quick dongle to convert over.\n\n194\n00:09:30.333 --> 00:09:34.480\nSo if you got fire wire devices,\nyou really need into replacing them.\n\n195\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.503\nBut anything else,\nyou can probably get a dongle for and\n\n196\n00:09:37.503 --> 00:09:41.695\nget it attached to pretty much any Mac.\n&gt;&gt; Do you have to install drivers to use\n\n197\n00:09:41.695 --> 00:09:43.863\ndevices?\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n198\n00:09:43.863 --> 00:09:45.090\nIt depends on the device.\n\n199\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.904\nSo some of them, no.\n\n200\n00:09:46.904 --> 00:09:50.861\nFor example,\nI'm hooking my [INAUDIBLE] backup.\n\n201\n00:09:50.861 --> 00:09:51.714\nFor example,\n\n202\n00:09:51.714 --> 00:09:56.632\nanother thing that was dropped In MacBooks\nprobably in the last five or six years.\n\n203\n00:09:56.632 --> 00:09:58.955\nThey don't come with CD drives anymore.\n\n204\n00:09:58.955 --> 00:10:03.190\nSo if I need to read a CD or a DVD,\nI can't or I could buy an Apple SuperDrive\n\n205\n00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.584\nwhich I've got one around here somewhere\nor I've got this one right here.\n\n206\n00:10:07.584 --> 00:10:10.826\nThis is a Samsung just\na removable CD drive.\n\n207\n00:10:10.826 --> 00:10:13.311\nThese things are be like QVC.\n\n208\n00:10:13.311 --> 00:10:15.285\nThese are available for\nas low as $25 on blah, blah,\n\n209\n00:10:15.285 --> 00:10:16.030\nblah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n210\n00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.919\n&gt;&gt; So anyhow, they're cheap and\n\n211\n00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:20.389\nyou can stick them onto a Mac, except for\n\n212\n00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:24.470\nthe whole traditional USB cable\nwhich I don't have any ports for.\n\n213\n00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.100\nFortunately, I've got my dongle.\n\n214\n00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:32.674\nSo I can take this and I can just pop it\nright onto my Mac, and it might work.\n\n215\n00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:36.920\nI'm saying it might, because do I\nneed a driver for this to work?\n\n216\n00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.651\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n217\n00:10:37.651 --> 00:10:39.930\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes yes, sometimes no.\n\n218\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.580\nSome devices are natively supported.\n\n219\n00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.820\nSo for example,\nthis one I believe is natively supported.\n\n220\n00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.816\nI can't remember if there's\na disc in there or not.\n\n221\n00:10:46.816 --> 00:10:48.299\nIf there's no disk in,\nit might not show up.\n\n222\n00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:51.370\nBut I'm gonna plug that in, there we go.\n\n223\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:55.280\nAnd when I plug that in,\nmy Mac is gonna see it.\n\n224\n00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.440\nAnd I know it's working,\ncuz it powers the drive.\n\n225\n00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.184\nSo I was able to hit the eject button and\nit opened.\n\n226\n00:11:01.184 --> 00:11:05.430\nI don't see it in my desktop,\nbecause there's no CD in the drive.\n\n227\n00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.678\nBut if I go to my system preferences\nassuming that it found it,\n\n228\n00:11:08.678 --> 00:11:11.931\nI've got a new system preference\nright there, CDs and DVDs.\n\n229\n00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:12.906\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n230\n00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:14.850\n&gt;&gt; So that's showing up, I've got it.\n\n231\n00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.522\nIf I unplug that thing and take it out,\nI don't have a CD or DVD anymore.\n\n232\n00:11:19.522 --> 00:11:22.858\nThat little icon's gonna stick\naround at least until I reboot,\n\n233\n00:11:22.858 --> 00:11:23.980\nthen it will go away.\n\n234\n00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.595\nBut it did see it and I didn't have to\nload a driver, and that even goes for\n\n235\n00:11:27.595 --> 00:11:30.040\nthings that are a little more complex.\n\n236\n00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.925\nThis little guy right here is a strange\nlittle box that I bought awhile back.\n\n237\n00:11:35.925 --> 00:11:40.028\nI got tired when I go to my office and\nI take my MacBook to my office,\n\n238\n00:11:40.028 --> 00:11:43.329\nI have some speakers in\nthe office that I like to use.\n\n239\n00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:47.064\nAnd I hated having to plug it into the\nheadphone jack every single day just plug\n\n240\n00:11:47.064 --> 00:11:49.010\nit in, plug it in, plug it in.\n\n241\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.691\nSo I got this little USB sound card.\n\n242\n00:11:51.691 --> 00:11:55.950\nIt's a sound card built entirely in\na USB port, so it goes in the USB hub.\n\n243\n00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.446\nAnd when I go into my office and\nplugin the USB hub,\n\n244\n00:11:58.446 --> 00:12:02.370\nthe sound card magically shows up and\nthe speakers are plugged into it.\n\n245\n00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.842\nThis you'd think something is complex\nas a sound card would need a driver,\n\n246\n00:12:05.842 --> 00:12:07.780\nit's natively supported by MAC OS also.\n\n247\n00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:12.670\nSo if I plug it in, I'll just pop it\nin there and I'll wait just a moment.\n\n248\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:19.806\nIt's gonna register in and it will\nshow up as one of my sound sources.\n\n249\n00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:23.583\nAnd so when I come over here and\nlook at my sound menu now right there,\n\n250\n00:12:23.583 --> 00:12:26.910\nUSB audio device,\nit doesn't have the right name.\n\n251\n00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.877\nBut it doesn't need a driver\njust automatically shows up.\n\n252\n00:12:29.877 --> 00:12:32.359\nAnd now,\nI can start pushing audio out of that.\n\n253\n00:12:32.359 --> 00:12:36.264\nAnd if I unplug that which was way\nharder than it should have been,\n\n254\n00:12:36.264 --> 00:12:37.990\nthen that's gonna go away.\n\n255\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.120\nAnd now, USB audio device is gone.\n\n256\n00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.840\nSo those are two examples right there of\ndevices that don't need a driver, but\n\n257\n00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.820\nit's not all like that.\n\n258\n00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.342\nBack in my office,\nI actually do have a camera,\n\n259\n00:12:50.342 --> 00:12:56.088\nan external camera that doesn't look up\nmy nose and that one does need a driver.\n\n260\n00:12:56.088 --> 00:12:59.900\nIt's from a company called Logitech,\nwhich most of you have probably heard of.\n\n261\n00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.622\nAnd if you go to Logitech's website\nwhich I'm pulling up right here,\n\n262\n00:13:02.622 --> 00:13:04.387\nthey've go where you can download drivers.\n\n263\n00:13:04.387 --> 00:13:07.800\nSo my camera's an HD Pro Webcam C-920.\n\n264\n00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.680\nRolls right off the tongue.\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n265\n00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.227\n&gt;&gt; But if you go to their website,\n\n266\n00:13:11.227 --> 00:13:14.570\nthey have where you can download and\nyou can pull the driver for it.\n\n267\n00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:18.660\nAnd so they support for Mac OS 10.13, but\nthey've got previous versions supported\n\n268\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.680\nand you can download and\nload that driver on your system.\n\n269\n00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.068\nAnd now, the camera's supported.\n\n270\n00:13:24.068 --> 00:13:28.757\nIn the case of my camera, if I plug it in\nwithout a driver, it actually does work.\n\n271\n00:13:28.757 --> 00:13:32.369\nBut I lose all the advanced functionality\nlike the lighting correction.\n\n272\n00:13:32.369 --> 00:13:34.243\nAnd so everything is super overexposed.\n\n273\n00:13:34.243 --> 00:13:39.808\nThe moment I load the driver,\nall of a sudden, everything looks good.\n\n274\n00:13:39.808 --> 00:13:41.480\nAs good as I can make it, at least.\n\n275\n00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.243\nIt corrects for lighting and shadowing,\nand color saturation, and all that.\n\n276\n00:13:45.243 --> 00:13:46.806\nAnd now, you can start to see everything.\n\n277\n00:13:46.806 --> 00:13:48.763\nSo when you install those drivers,\n\n278\n00:13:48.763 --> 00:13:51.906\nit's enabling all\nthe functionality of that hardware.\n\n279\n00:13:51.906 --> 00:13:55.309\nIf you ever wanna see the drivers\nthat are installed on your system,\n\n280\n00:13:55.309 --> 00:13:58.305\nin your terminal,\nyou can actually browse and find those.\n\n281\n00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:04.460\nThey are usually tucked away\ninside of /library/extensions.\n\n282\n00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.341\nIf you browse into that folder and take\na look, you'll see a bunch of files in\n\n283\n00:14:08.341 --> 00:14:11.800\nthere and some of them will be tied\nto software you've installed and\n\n284\n00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.394\nsome will be tied to hardware.\n\n285\n00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:17.106\nSo looking in this list, I can see\nthings like my Logitech Unify and\n\n286\n00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:20.150\nthat's my Logitech keyboard and touchpad.\n\n287\n00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:24.050\nAnd actually, I don't I don't\nsee the camera in this list.\n\n288\n00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.800\nIf you don't see the driver there, there\nare a few other places where it could\n\n289\n00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.914\nappear, depending on how\nthat software's installed.\n\n290\n00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:35.839\nI had to restore my laptop\nfrom time machine and\n\n291\n00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:40.191\nit is possible that I hadn't installed\nthe driver at that point, but\n\n292\n00:14:40.191 --> 00:14:44.360\nit could also be inside of slash\nsystem /library/extensions.\n\n293\n00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.733\nIt's not normally gonna be here, but these\nare the ones that are typically developed\n\n294\n00:14:48.733 --> 00:14:52.573\nby Apple and third parties aren't\nsupposed to put their extensions here.\n\n295\n00:14:52.573 --> 00:14:55.700\nSo if I take a look, I don't expect\nto find a Logitech one in here.\n\n296\n00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.670\nBut you just never know these days,\npeople put stuff all over the place.\n\n297\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.690\nAnd yeah, just a quick scan.\n\n298\n00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:05.282\nI don't see it, but there's a ton\nof drivers in here that are all\n\n299\n00:15:05.282 --> 00:15:09.704\nbuilt around what Apple hardware\nwas official Apple stuff and\n\n300\n00:15:09.704 --> 00:15:12.528\nyou find things tucked in here as well.\n\n301\n00:15:12.528 --> 00:15:15.860\nBut that's where these drivers\ntypically go if you need them.\n\n302\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.853\nIt used to be in the olden days\nthat when you bought a Mac,\n\n303\n00:15:18.853 --> 00:15:21.674\nyou just didn't know if\nhardware was going to work.\n\n304\n00:15:21.674 --> 00:15:24.872\nBut Apple has done such a great job and\nthird party developers,\n\n305\n00:15:24.872 --> 00:15:28.975\nthe hardware developers have done such\na great job with creating drivers now that\n\n306\n00:15:28.975 --> 00:15:33.160\nit's a rare day that you get a hardware\ndevice that doesn't just work with MAC OS.\n\n307\n00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.282\nYou just plug it in and\nyou're ready to rock, so\n\n308\n00:15:35.282 --> 00:15:38.665\nthey've done a great job of that.\n&gt;&gt; So how can we see and you've already\n\n309\n00:15:38.665 --> 00:15:42.840\ntouched on this, but how do we see what\ndevices have been detected by the system?\n\n310\n00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.094\n&gt;&gt; So if I don't see the extension here,\n\n311\n00:15:45.094 --> 00:15:49.401\nif it doesn't need a driver,\nthen I probably won't see the extension.\n\n312\n00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:51.230\nIf I don't see the extension,\nhow do I know it is there?\n\n313\n00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:56.037\nWhen I plug that CD drive in,\nI'll plug that CD drive back in and\n\n314\n00:15:56.037 --> 00:15:57.592\nit didn't show up.\n\n315\n00:15:57.592 --> 00:15:59.454\nThere is no disk in the drive.\n\n316\n00:15:59.454 --> 00:16:02.307\nHow do I know it works?\n\n317\n00:16:02.307 --> 00:16:04.036\nWell, what I did, I kind of cheated.\n\n318\n00:16:04.036 --> 00:16:08.122\nI said, well, hey,\nif If I go into System Preferences,\n\n319\n00:16:08.122 --> 00:16:12.903\n[COUGH] I get the CDs &amp; DVDs icon\nright there, obviously it worked.\n\n320\n00:16:12.903 --> 00:16:14.353\nIs it obvious?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n321\n00:16:14.353 --> 00:16:15.472\n&gt;&gt; Do I actually know that it worked?\n\n322\n00:16:15.472 --> 00:16:19.479\nMaybe I'm connected to a Remote Disc,\nmaybe I have an Apple SuperDrive hiding\n\n323\n00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:20.994\nunder the podium down here.\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n324\n00:16:20.994 --> 00:16:22.375\n&gt;&gt; And that's what's working,\n\n325\n00:16:22.375 --> 00:16:23.390\nnot this Samsung one.\n\n326\n00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.136\nHow do I know the Samsung\none actually worked?\n\n327\n00:16:26.136 --> 00:16:29.350\nWell for that,\nwe'll have to dig a little bit deeper.\n\n328\n00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.806\nAnd there's two places that we can go,\n\n329\n00:16:30.806 --> 00:16:31.591\nall right?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n330\n00:16:31.591 --> 00:16:33.929\n&gt;&gt; One place is we can watch the system\n\n331\n00:16:33.929 --> 00:16:35.480\nConsole, all right?\n\n332\n00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.488\nThere's a utility,\nincluded with Mac OS, called Console.\n\n333\n00:16:39.488 --> 00:16:43.790\nIf you wanna browse and find it,\nit's inside of /Applications/Utilities.\n\n334\n00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.306\nAnd the Console is your system log.\n\n335\n00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:49.142\nAnd when it comes up eventually,\nthere it is,\n\n336\n00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:54.760\nit's showing all the stuff that's going on\nin the background on your system, okay?\n\n337\n00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.999\nAnd there's usually\na lot of stuff going on.\n\n338\n00:16:57.999 --> 00:16:59.253\nSo when you take a device,\n\n339\n00:16:59.253 --> 00:17:02.940\nI'm gonna take this CD drive,\nI'm gonna unplug it, all right?\n\n340\n00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.380\nAnd we'll give that just a moment.\n\n341\n00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.160\nMuch Invalid Display message is there.\n\n342\n00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:07.718\nThere we go, all right.\n\n343\n00:17:07.718 --> 00:17:09.190\nSo it's unplugged.\n\n344\n00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:13.690\nAnd I'm gonna plug in that USB sound,\nthingamajigger.\n\n345\n00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:14.993\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n346\n00:17:14.993 --> 00:17:15.545\n&gt;&gt; And when I play,\n\n347\n00:17:15.545 --> 00:17:16.840\nthat's the official term.\n\n348\n00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.436\nSo when I plug it in, there we go,\n\n349\n00:17:18.436 --> 00:17:21.240\nI start getting messages that\nare coming across, right?\n\n350\n00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.030\nAnd if I look at those messages, oops, did\nthey scrolled too fast, where'd they go?\n\n351\n00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.747\nHang on, I gotta find it now.\n\n352\n00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:30.833\nSometimes the stuff\nscrolls by really fast.\n\n353\n00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:34.259\nBut what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna detect that hardware, and\n\n354\n00:17:34.259 --> 00:17:36.500\nit's gonna add it to the system.\n\n355\n00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.322\nAnd so you'll see it up here.\n\n356\n00:17:37.322 --> 00:17:39.471\nHere it is, right here.\n\n357\n00:17:39.471 --> 00:17:41.829\n+Add USB Audio Device, right?\n&gt;&gt;

Mm.\n\n415\n00:20:01.803 --> 00:20:03.058\n&gt;&gt; But not every CD or\n\n416\n00:20:03.058 --> 00:20:05.252\nDVD drive is a writer, right?\n\n417\n00:20:05.252 --> 00:20:07.221\nA SuperDrive is, or the Samsung disk is.\n\n418\n00:20:07.221 --> 00:20:10.190\nSo under Disc Burning,\nI actually see it right here.\n\n419\n00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.437\nAnd it just says, Generic Drive Support.\n\n420\n00:20:12.437 --> 00:20:14.910\nSo again, it doesn't really have a name.\n\n421\n00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.375\nOr right here it's TSSTcorp,\nwhich I don't know,\n\n422\n00:20:18.375 --> 00:20:21.560\nSamsung technologies maybe?\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n519\n00:24:19.895 --> 00:24:20.750\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty funny.\n\n520\n00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.497\nBut if we look down here, I can see\nthat this is running up to 10 Gb/sec,\n\n521\n00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:29.864\nwhich means that it is running at\nbasically full USB 3.1 speeds,\n\n522\n00:24:29.864 --> 00:24:32.722\nwhich is the equivalent of Thunderbolt 1.\n\n523\n00:24:32.722 --> 00:24:34.870\nIt kinda highlights why Thunderbolt is so\npowerful.\n\n524\n00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:40.608\nIf you can get Thunderbolt,\nyou really should, cuz it is so fast.\n\n525\n00:24:40.608 --> 00:24:41.710\nBecause if it's showing up,\nright there, I can see it.\n\n526\n00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.389\nI can even see the file\nsystems that are on it.\n\n527\n00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:47.157\nAnd it'll show up under some of\nthese other connector types as\n\n528\n00:24:47.157 --> 00:24:50.430\nwell because it is storage\nsomewhere buried in here.\n\n529\n00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.747\nWell somewhere in here, it'll turn up.\n\n530\n00:24:54.747 --> 00:24:57.010\nBut either way,\nwe can spot that and see it.\n\n531\n00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.862\nSo that's really the best\nway to come in and\n\n532\n00:24:58.862 --> 00:25:00.874\nverify that hardware is\nactually showing up.\n\n533\n00:25:00.874 --> 00:25:03.638\nIf it shows up in here and\nit's like an unknown device,\n\n534\n00:25:03.638 --> 00:25:07.850\nthat's usually the indicator that it's\ntime to go and download a driver.\n\n535\n00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:10.834\nYou gotta load a driver in order for\nthat device to show up and work.\n\n536\n00:25:10.834 --> 00:25:12.237\n&gt;&gt; Another great episode,\n\n537\n00:25:12.237 --> 00:25:13.740\nperipheral devices!\n\n538\n00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.608\nDon, I know you wanna say\nsomething else before we move on.\n\n539\n00:25:16.608 --> 00:25:18.138\n&gt;&gt; Key thing here, or key take away for\n\n540\n00:25:18.138 --> 00:25:20.994\na support professional,\nis that just because a device works now,\n\n541\n00:25:20.994 --> 00:25:22.530\ndoesn't mean it'll work later.\n\n542\n00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:26.484\n[LAUGH] So make sure that you update\nyour drivers, get the hardware loaded,\n\n543\n00:25:26.484 --> 00:25:27.373\nget it working.\n\n544\n00:25:27.373 --> 00:25:32.330\nBut anytime MAC OS updates,\nit can potentially break the drivers.\n\n545\n00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:35.254\nThis is really true with docking\nstations that use DisplayLink for\n\n546\n00:25:35.254 --> 00:25:36.148\ntheir video cards.\n\n547\n00:25:36.148 --> 00:25:39.918\nEvery new version of Mac OS seems to\nbreak those really, really reliably.\n\n548\n00:25:39.918 --> 00:25:43.093\nSo you wanna make sure that\nwhenever you update Mac OS,\n\n549\n00:25:43.093 --> 00:25:47.098\nyou also take some time to look and\nsee if there's updated drivers for\n\n550\n00:25:47.098 --> 00:25:50.430\nyour hardware,\nthat will usually solve most problems.\n\n551\n00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:54.380\nIf you add some new hardware and your\ncomputer starts locking up or freaking\n\n552\n00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.816\nout, remember that you can do Safe Boot.\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n553\n00:25:56.816 --> 00:25:58.562\n&gt;&gt; If you boot your system while holding\n\n554\n00:25:58.562 --> 00:26:01.714\nthe Shift keys on your keyboard,\nyou'll boot into Safe Boot, and\n\n555\n00:26:01.714 --> 00:26:03.200\nit won't load those drivers.\n\n556\n00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.183\nThat way you can get in, uninstall\nthe drivers, and get yourself back up and\n\n557\n00:26:06.183 --> 00:26:06.840\nrunning again.\n\n558\n00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.801\nSo kind of nice functionality to have\nthere, just remember that it's all\n\n559\n00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:13.376\na part of our troubleshooting process.\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, thank you Don.\n\n560\n00:26:13.376 --> 00:26:16.760\nAnd remember, Apple Certified Support\nProfessional is a fantastic series.\n\n561\n00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.676\nMake sure you watch every episode,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n562\n00:26:19.676 --> 00:26:21.444\nYou'll be in the course library too,\n\n563\n00:26:21.444 --> 00:26:24.940\nwhere there's thousands of other videos\ndesigned to help you go further.\n\n564\n00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.643\nSo check those out, too.\n\n565\n00:26:26.643 --> 00:26:29.000\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n566\n00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:29.816\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n567\n00:26:29.816 --> 00:26:32.195\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt;

do.\n\n11\n00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.430\nAnd Don Pezet's here to\nshow us how to do that.\n\n12\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.160\nDon, good to see you.\n\n13\n00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.665\n&gt;&gt; Hey, glad to be here, Zach, and glad\nhelp people kill trees whenever they can.\n\n14\n00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:36.226\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Our advancing society, more and\n\n15\n00:00:36.226 --> 00:00:38.440\nmore people have moved away from printers,\nright?\n\n16\n00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.770\nThey have-\n&gt;&gt; It's true.\n\n17\n00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.270\n&gt;&gt; Digital documents, PDFs,\nthings of that nature.\n\n18\n00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.535\nBut printing is still a very,\n\n19\n00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:48.725\nvery critical piece of almost\nevery business that's out there.\n\n20\n00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:50.625\nWhen you go to a store they\ngive you a paper receipt.\n\n21\n00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:54.125\nWhen you go to the bank you\nfill out a paper deposit slip.\n\n22\n00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.635\nThat stuff is still done on paper, and\n\n23\n00:00:56.635 --> 00:00:59.415\nas a result,\nprinters are still really important.\n\n24\n00:00:59.415 --> 00:01:01.855\nSo in this episode,\nwe're gonna talk about printers.\n\n25\n00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:03.185\nHow we can use them with our Mac?\n\n26\n00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:05.666\nHow we can get them set up,\nall that magic?\n\n27\n00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:09.261\nAnd just get a chance to see what it's\nlike to support printers in a general Mac\n\n28\n00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:11.381\nenvironment all right\nhere in this episode.\n\n29\n00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:13.960\n&gt;&gt; So basic question,\nhow do we add printers to a Mac?\n\n30\n00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.323\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, there are two ways.\n\n31\n00:01:16.323 --> 00:01:17.741\nThere's the old way and there's new way.\n\n32\n00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:21.480\nAnd the old way is you buy\nthis brand new printer.\n\n33\n00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.181\nAnd you hook a cable into it, and\nyou plug that cable into your Mac.\n\n34\n00:01:25.181 --> 00:01:29.980\nAnd your Mac magically sees the printer,\nand it works, and that's that, right?\n\n35\n00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.990\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n\n36\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.325\n&gt;&gt; But, I will tell you that very\nfew people do that these days.\n\n37\n00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:39.070\nOlder style printers used a syntronix\ncable and a parallel connector.\n\n38\n00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.800\nThere were some Mac specific\nprinters that used scuzzy cables.\n\n39\n00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.120\nNone of those ports are found on any Mac,\n\n40\n00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.020\nanymore manufactured in the last decade,\nreally.\n\n41\n00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.780\nSo all of that's old news.\n\n42\n00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.780\nIf you go to the store and\nbuy a printer today,\n\n43\n00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.240\nit will likely have a USB port on it so\nthat you can plug it in via USB.\n\n44\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.731\nWell, I have yet to see a printer\nthat had a USB-C connector on it, so\n\n45\n00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:03.777\nit's usually gonna come with the older\nstyle USB-B connector or whatever.\n\n46\n00:02:03.777 --> 00:02:05.380\nA, B, I mix those up.\n\n47\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.440\nBut either way, most of our Macs\nare not gonna use that, and\n\n48\n00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.800\neven if they did it would not matter.\n\n49\n00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.190\nMost of us are gonna want the printer\nto be on the network instead.\n\n50\n00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.600\nIf I take a printer and I plug it right\ninto my computer, I can print to it,\n\n51\n00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.820\nbut what about Zack?\n\n52\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.770\nWhat about the other\npeople in the building?\n\n53\n00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.820\nThey can't, right?\n\n54\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.090\nUnless we share it on the network.\n\n55\n00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.070\nBut if I want everybody\nto be able to access it,\n\n56\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.360\nwouldn't it be better if the printer\nwas plugged into the network.\n\n57\n00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.960\nOr if it was connected via\nwireless onto the network.\n\n58\n00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we're gonna see on\n\n59\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.510\nalmost every environment today.\n\n60\n00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.140\nRanging from the little\nprinters that you get at home,\n\n61\n00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.970\nto the massive corporate size\nbusiness machines that you can get.\n\n62\n00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.870\nAll of those are moving into\nthat network-enabled world.\n\n63\n00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.270\nAnd this isn't a process that started,\nor the year before.\n\n64\n00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.580\nThis is a process that\nstarted 15 years ago.\n\n65\n00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.072\nSo by this point, if you walk\ninto Staples, or Office Depot, or\n\n66\n00:03:00.072 --> 00:03:01.667\nsome place like that.\n\n67\n00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:05.800\nPretty much every printer they have\nsupports being connected to the network.\n\n68\n00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.840\nAnd a big driver of that\nare mobile phones and\n\n69\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.790\ntablets, because they don't have ports on\nthem to be able to connect to a printer.\n\n70\n00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.070\nThey need to communicate over the\nwireless, and so your Mac can do that too.\n\n71\n00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.990\nSo as far as getting a printer connected,\nyou usually don't even have to.\n\n72\n00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.250\nYou just connect right over the network.\n\n73\n00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.920\n&gt;&gt; Do we need to load drivers for\nit first?\n\n74\n00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.640\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes yes,\nactually a lot of times you do.\n\n75\n00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.170\nThis is an area where Apple's\nreally done some impressive stuff.\n\n76\n00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.912\nSo in the olden days,\nwhen you bought a printer,\n\n77\n00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:38.950\nyou had to make sure that it supported\nMac OS, that was a big deal.\n\n78\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.240\nIf it didn't, the odds are you\nweren't gonna get it to work.\n\n79\n00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.616\nSo the old rule of thumb was buy an HP,\n\n80\n00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:47.618\nHewlett Packard partnering with\napple on quite a few things.\n\n81\n00:03:47.618 --> 00:03:51.661\nAnd they're really good about making\nsure the Apple always had drivers for\n\n82\n00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:52.700\nevery HP printer.\n\n83\n00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.440\nSo you knew you couldn't go wrong\nif you bought an HP printer.\n\n84\n00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.842\nBut if you bought a Lexmark,\nor a Canon, or a Brotheror, or\n\n85\n00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:03.950\nsomebody else Okie Data right one of\nthe other companies that are out there.\n\n86\n00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.352\nYou didn't know you just didn't know\nis it gonna work, is it not gonna work,\n\n87\n00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:09.722\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n88\n00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:12.284\nFor those you would have to go and\nget a driver, and\n\n89\n00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:14.726\nyou really need to do\nthe research beforehand.\n\n90\n00:04:14.726 --> 00:04:18.030\nDon't buy a printer unless you\nknow that driver is available.\n\n91\n00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.860\nWell, Apple finally said all right,\nenough is enough, this is a mess, and\n\n92\n00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.350\nwhen they switched from being\ndedicated Mac OS over to OS 10,\n\n93\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.068\nwhen they switched to BSD under the hood,\nthat was the UnixWorld.\n\n94\n00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:30.350\nIn the UnixWorld,\n\n95\n00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.340\nprinter support was even worse\nbecause nobody made drivers for Unix.\n\n96\n00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.020\nAnd so, the Unix admins,\n\n97\n00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.470\nthe developers there were having to make\ntheir own drivers, it was the Wild West.\n\n98\n00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.170\nAnd so\nApple created something called CUPS.\n\n99\n00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.320\nCUPS is the Common Unix Printing Service,\nC-U-P-S.\n\n100\n00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.840\nAnd they assigned developers to it,\nthey created this platform.\n\n101\n00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.390\nAnd then, they did something crazy,\nthey open sourced it, they gave it away.\n\n102\n00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.470\nAnd today, every Mac,\npretty much every Linux distribution,\n\n103\n00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.660\nevery BSD, and\non the Unix side are all using CUPS now.\n\n104\n00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.060\nAnd so, if I'm a printer manufacturer and\nI create some brand new shiny printer.\n\n105\n00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.890\nInstead of having to create\na Windows driver, Mac, Linux, BSD,\n\n106\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.280\nall these different things,\nI just need to create a Windows driver and\n\n107\n00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.540\na CUPS driver, and that's it.\n\n108\n00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.430\nAnd I can support all\nthese different platforms.\n\n109\n00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.202\nSo now a manufacturer's a lot\nmore likely to create drivers for\n\n110\n00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:31.630\nMac OS, because it covers all\nof these other platforms too.\n\n111\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.882\nSo the drivers are available,\nand when you go to a website like\n\n112\n00:05:36.882 --> 00:05:42.538\nhere I'll show you, if I go to HP,\nand whoops, or I go to twitter,\n\n113\n00:05:42.538 --> 00:05:47.288\napparently I am just getting\na little click crazy here.\n\n114\n00:05:47.288 --> 00:05:53.549\nBut if we go to HP's website and we go to\ndownload drivers for an HP printer well,\n\n115\n00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:59.830\nwhat you'll find is they'll have drivers\nthat are for both Windows and Mac OS.\n\n116\n00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.040\nSo if I come in here and search, I'm just\npicking a printer that we have here in\n\n117\n00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.091\nthe office an HP LaserJet M506, right?\n\n118\n00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.430\nSo I can find that printer\nI can click on it.\n\n119\n00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.710\nWe go in here, and\nit's gonna ask me to pick my driver.\n\n120\n00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.160\nAnd I'll see Linux, Mac OS,\nOS Independent, SAP, UNIX, Windows.\n\n121\n00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.400\nWell, if I pick Windows,\nthat's usually a Windows specific driver.\n\n122\n00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.480\nBut if I pick Linux, SAP, UNIX, Mac OS,\nthose are all actually the same driver.\n\n123\n00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.500\nThey're all that same CUPS driver.\n\n124\n00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.549\nThe only thing that's different is\nthe installation package, right?\n\n125\n00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:36.560\nIn Mac OS, it has the nice little GUI.\n\n126\n00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.918\nIf I choose Linux, it's a little\ncommand line utility that you run.\n\n127\n00:06:39.918 --> 00:06:42.980\nAnd then, you can pick the operating\nsystem version, so I got 10.13.\n\n128\n00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.350\nI can download that driver.\n\n129\n00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.790\nNow, I'll tell you most printers\nwill work without the driver,\n\n130\n00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.540\nbut you'll just get\nbasic printing support.\n\n131\n00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.160\nPrinters can usually do a lot more.\n\n132\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.840\nSome of them have staplers built in,\n\n133\n00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.610\nthey've got full duplex where\nthey can print double sided.\n\n134\n00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.840\nSome of them have folders and\nhole punchers built into them.\n\n135\n00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.350\nAll sort of craziness, sometimes\nscanners and fax machines built in.\n\n136\n00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.160\nNone of that's gonna work unless you\nhave the driver from the vendor.\n\n137\n00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.330\nSo you go, you download the driver,\nand you get it loaded.\n\n138\n00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.830\nSo that may well be something you need to\ndo just to get the driver up and going.\n\n139\n00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.470\nNow, if the printer supports AirPlay, then\nwhat'll happen is your Mac will talk to\n\n140\n00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:27.290\nthe printer, will learn about it, and\nautomatically download the driver for you.\n\n141\n00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.500\nSo you don't have to load it,\nthat's really cool if it supports AirPlay.\n\n142\n00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.210\nBut not every printer does.\n\n143\n00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.437\nSo if it doesn't support AirPlay, you\njust need to go to the vendor's website,\n\n144\n00:07:36.437 --> 00:07:39.103\nwhoever made that printer, and\ndownload their official driver.\n\n145\n00:07:39.103 --> 00:07:41.250\nAnd that'll give you that\nadditional functionality.\n\n146\n00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.480\nAnd let you get in there and function.\n\n147\n00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.891\nIf you wanna know what printers\nare supported natively,\n\n148\n00:07:46.891 --> 00:07:48.880\nyou can drop into your terminal,\n\n149\n00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.230\nand in the terminal if you browse into\n/ took into two different places.\n\n150\n00:07:53.230 --> 00:08:00.130\nIf you wanna see the ones that are built\nin you can go to /system/library/printers,\n\n151\n00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.990\nthat folder right there,\n/system/library/printers.\n\n152\n00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.440\nNormally, extensions go in\n/system/library/extensions, but\n\n153\n00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.280\nthe printer drivers are special,\nso they put them over here.\n\n154\n00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.800\nAnd if you take a look you\ncan see what's built in.\n\n155\n00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.730\nAnd apparently,\nI just have a libraries folder.\n\n156\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.130\nThere we go, and so we can start\nto see what's kind of built in.\n\n157\n00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.530\nNow, on mine I don't have much.\n\n158\n00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.350\nI just see USBGenericPrintingClass.\n\n159\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.640\nAll right, so that's kind of a generic\nprinter driver, and then you'll see\n\n160\n00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:36.030\nthe Internet printing protocol and\nthe Printing Protocol Daemon, PPD.\n\n161\n00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:40.450\nThe CUPS drivers are actually\nfiles that end in .ppd and so\n\n162\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.940\nthis is what's connecting Internet\nprinting protocol to the ppd system.\n\n163\n00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.513\nSo that's all part of CUPS.\n\n164\n00:08:45.513 --> 00:08:48.700\nBut I'm not seeing a lot of third party\ndrivers or anything special here.\n\n165\n00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.620\nWhich means I'm gonna have basic printing\nservices unless I add a printer and\n\n166\n00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.750\ndownload something.\n\n167\n00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.520\nIf I go into /Libraries/Printers,\n\n168\n00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.460\nthis one is where my third party\nsoftware would show up, and\n\n169\n00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.930\nin here, I see a Canon folder,\nI see an Epson folder.\n\n170\n00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.130\nYou might not see those on yours.\n\n171\n00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.070\nI'm seeing them because apparently at\nsome point, I've taken this laptop\n\n172\n00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.140\nnear a Canon or near an Epson, and\nso it started loading a driver.\n\n173\n00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.714\nIf I go into PPDs, into that folder,\nAnd take a look around,\n\n174\n00:09:17.714 --> 00:09:21.499\nwell I just see Contents\nnothing too crazy there.\n\n175\n00:09:21.499 --> 00:09:25.393\nAnd then, if I get inside of it I can\nstart to find any drivers that may or\n\n176\n00:09:25.393 --> 00:09:26.850\nmay not have been loaded.\n\n177\n00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.605\nAnd so, here's this Epson Fax,\n\n178\n00:09:28.605 --> 00:09:31.814\nI don't remember connecting\nto an Epson printer recently.\n\n179\n00:09:31.814 --> 00:09:34.377\nBut apparently,\nI've loaded it at some point, and so\n\n180\n00:09:34.377 --> 00:09:37.180\nI can see that driver sitting\nright there to be able to do it.\n\n181\n00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.020\nAnd it looks like there's an US version,\nthis Epsom fax, and\n\n182\n00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.650\nthen a European version.\n\n183\n00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.520\nBecause we have US letter size,\n\n184\n00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.940\nand then there's A3 letter size that's\nused in Europe, so I can see it.\n\n185\n00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.350\nNow, I'm not seeing much in these folders,\nthey're fairly empty.\n\n186\n00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.780\nBut that's because I haven't really\nadded any printers onto my system.\n\n187\n00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.580\nSo basically, once we add a printer,\nstuff will start to show up.\n\n188\n00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.840\nSo let me show you that.\n\n189\n00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.170\nI'm gonna go into my System Preferences,\nand\n\n190\n00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:06.960\nI'm gonna go into Printers &amp; Scanners,\nand here I'm gonna see my printers, okay?\n\n191\n00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.470\nNow it's telling me,\nno printers are available, all right?\n\n192\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.040\nNow, you're gonna get\nmixed signals from Mac OS.\n\n193\n00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.910\nWhat it's telling me here is,\n\n194\n00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.890\nI don't have any printers\npermanently set up, all right?\n\n195\n00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:24.380\nBut if you go somewhere, like here in\nSafari, if I tell it I wanna print this\n\n196\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:30.620\npage and it pulls up the printing dialog,\nsometimes you'll see printers show up.\n\n197\n00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.440\nWhen I drop down that list,\nI've got No Printer Selected.\n\n198\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.240\nIt told me I had no printers.\n\n199\n00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.615\nBut here's three, HP ColorerJet M553,\n\n200\n00:10:38.615 --> 00:10:44.610\nITProTV_Office_BW_HP LaserJet M506, and\nTim Office- HP Color LaserJet M553.\n\n201\n00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.230\nI wonder what that one is.\n\n202\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.140\nSo where the heck are these coming from?\n\n203\n00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.160\nThat's AirPlay, my system is using\nthe Bonjour protocol to detect\n\n204\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.460\nprinters on the network and\nfind ones that might be available for me.\n\n205\n00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.730\nAnd so even though I don't have these\nprinters installed, I can find them, and\n\n206\n00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.410\nI can still use them.\n\n207\n00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.420\nI'm gonna print on Tim's Printer,\nso I'm gonna pick it.\n\n208\n00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.010\nSee how it's saying\nPreparing Tim's Office?\n\n209\n00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:11.700\nIt's actually connecting to Tim's Printer,\nfiguring out what driver it needs.\n\n210\n00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.228\nAnd if it's supported, it's actually\ngonna go and download that driver for me.\n\n211\n00:11:15.228 --> 00:11:17.730\nand it's gonna download it and\nget it loaded on here, and\n\n212\n00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.920\nnow I see I've got the two-sided option\n,I can print black and white, or\n\n213\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.380\nI can print in color I can set\nhow many pages I want to print.\n\n214\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.285\nI'm now ready to print to that printer.\n\n215\n00:11:27.285 --> 00:11:31.707\nBut if I go back to my system settings,\nhey look at that, there's Tim Office,\n\n216\n00:11:31.707 --> 00:11:32.645\nit added it in.\n\n217\n00:11:32.645 --> 00:11:33.355\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n218\n00:11:33.355 --> 00:11:36.095\n&gt;&gt; I didn't have to do anything,\nit even got the right picture,\n\n219\n00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.220\nthat's what that printer looks like.\n\n220\n00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's got it loaded, and\n\n221\n00:11:39.915 --> 00:11:41.145\nit's ready to rock.\n\n222\n00:11:41.145 --> 00:11:49.110\nAnd if I look at the kind\nHP Color LaserJet M553-AirPrint.\n\n223\n00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.770\nUse that AirPlay protocol to\nfind the printer and load it in.\n\n224\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.890\nSo that is telling me how it\ndiscovered it and there it is, right?\n\n225\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.141\nI could have added it manually if\nI hit the little plus sign here,\n\n226\n00:12:00.141 --> 00:12:02.205\nI can add a printer or scanner.\n\n227\n00:12:02.205 --> 00:12:06.064\nAnd now, if it's automatically found\nI can pick it, like this M506,\n\n228\n00:12:06.064 --> 00:12:08.560\nsee how it found it with Bonjour.\n\n229\n00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.730\nOr I can type in the information on that\nprinter and tell it how to find one.\n\n230\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.240\nHey, it's not listed here,\nI need to find it, and so\n\n231\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.090\nyou can pick that,\nthis one supports AirPrint.\n\n232\n00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:23.870\nBut if I drop that down, I'll see that\nit also can do PCL, and postscript, and\n\n233\n00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:24.880\nother things.\n\n234\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.210\nI'm gonna stick with secure AirPrint,\n\n235\n00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.370\ncuz that will do encrypted\ncommunications to the printer.\n\n236\n00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:30.180\nIt's really the best option.\n\n237\n00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.820\nAnd I'm gonna hit Add on that.\n\n238\n00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.560\nIt's gonna talk to that printer, and see\nif it can automatically get the driver.\n\n239\n00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.490\nAnd if it can, it loads it,\nand we're in good shape.\n\n240\n00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.604\nIf it can't, I wont see any advance\nfunctionality over here, and\n\n241\n00:12:42.604 --> 00:12:46.276\nthat would be my hit that all I\nneed to go to vendors web site,\n\n242\n00:12:46.276 --> 00:12:50.186\nand download the driver, and\nget that one load in, all right?\n\n243\n00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.860\nNow, once a printer shows up\nhere you can now print to it.\n\n244\n00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.966\nYou might want to two finger tap on it and\nchoose to set it as the default,\n\n245\n00:12:56.966 --> 00:12:59.919\nso that is the printer you\nwould print to normally.\n\n246\n00:12:59.919 --> 00:13:02.590\nAnd then, you can always pick\na different printer if you want.\n\n247\n00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:03.640\nBut once that's set up.\n\n248\n00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.970\nNow, I've got the printer, and\nI can print right out on that page.\n\n249\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:09.950\nShoot that document out.\n\n250\n00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.490\nThere it goes printing.\n\n251\n00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.645\nAnd now,\nI've mastered the world of printing.\n\n252\n00:13:13.645 --> 00:13:16.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't even have to plug in a cable.\n\n253\n00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.540\nI didn't even have to load a driver.\n\n254\n00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.288\nAlthough, I know where the drivers\nare in case I need them.\n\n255\n00:13:21.288 --> 00:13:24.275\n&gt;&gt; These CUPS allow us to\nshare printers on the network?\n\n256\n00:13:24.275 --> 00:13:26.349\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I didn't do it but we can,\n\n257\n00:13:26.349 --> 00:13:31.478\nyou might've noticed that Tim's Printer\nshowed up twice and let me tell you why.\n\n258\n00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:34.426\nWell, you might not have noticed,\nit might've looked like two printers to\n\n259\n00:13:34.426 --> 00:13:37.630\nyou but if you're in the know then\nit's actually Tim's Printer twice.\n\n260\n00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:42.317\nSo when I went to add a printer\nI see Tim's Office right\n\n261\n00:13:42.317 --> 00:13:46.808\nhere which was a HP LaserJet M553\nis that right?\n\n262\n00:13:46.808 --> 00:13:52.580\nYeah, 553, and then if I go to Add I\nsee another M553 right here, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.370\nIt's not two different printers,\nI'm seeing it twice.\n\n264\n00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.620\nOne, I'm seeing directly\nthrough the printer.\n\n265\n00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.720\nThe other one, I'm actually\nseeing from Tim's computer where\n\n266\n00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.880\nhe shared it out through his computer.\n\n267\n00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.080\nNow, it doesn't really\nmatter which one I print to,\n\n268\n00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.160\ncuz it's gonna come out on\nthe printer either way.\n\n269\n00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.523\nBut what happens if Tim\nturns his computer off?\n\n270\n00:14:13.523 --> 00:14:18.020\nIf he turns his computer off, the one\nI'm connected to is gonna disappear.\n\n271\n00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.930\nI'm gonna lose that one, right?\n\n272\n00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:24.680\nSo I usually wanna connect\ndirectly to the printer if we can.\n\n273\n00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.980\nIf you wanna control the print documents,\nmaybe stop people from printing or\n\n274\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.850\npermissions.\n\n275\n00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.940\nThen it's better to\npublish it from a machine.\n\n276\n00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.880\nBut if I just want people to\nbe able to get to it 24/7,\n\n277\n00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.900\nI want them to go directly to the printer.\n\n278\n00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.890\nBut once I've got a printer added, right?\n\n279\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:44.500\nLike this M506, I got an option right here\nwhere I can share printer on the network.\n\n280\n00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.110\nI can just check that off, and\n\n281\n00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:50.350\nnow anybody in the building is gonna start\nseeing Don's MacBook Pro with this HP, and\n\n282\n00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:55.070\nnobody will able to print through\nmy laptop to that printer.\n\n283\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.820\nNow, it make a lot of sense if\nI'm not gonna go forward and\n\n284\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.710\ndo an events configuration.\n\n285\n00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:04.470\nBut right here, that gets it shared, and\nnow people can print right through me.\n\n286\n00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.249\n&gt;&gt; Are there any other ways to\nshare a printer on the network?\n\n287\n00:15:07.249 --> 00:15:09.917\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and in fact,\nI don't normally do it this way.\n\n288\n00:15:09.917 --> 00:15:11.280\nSo I'm gonna uncheck that.\n\n289\n00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.410\nSo what I normally do is I go into\nthe sharing preferences, and that's what\n\n290\n00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.680\nthis button does right here, but\nlet's pretend that I didn't come first.\n\n291\n00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.070\nSo I just sat down at this computer and\nI decide hey,\n\n292\n00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.255\nit's time,\nI'm gonna share this printer, right?\n\n293\n00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:25.645\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do this all the time.\n\n294\n00:15:25.645 --> 00:15:27.326\nI'm gonna go in to my system preferences,\nand\n\n295\n00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:30.880\nI'm not gonna go to the printer screen,\nI'm gonna go to the sharing screen.\n\n296\n00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.614\nAnd in the sharing screen on the left\nside you can find Printer Sharing.\n\n297\n00:15:34.614 --> 00:15:37.740\nAnd we can check off that we\nwant to enable Printer Sharing.\n\n298\n00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:42.442\nWe can pick the printer that we wanna\nshare, I gonna do the ITProTV_Office\n\n299\n00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:47.860\nprinter, and then you can pick\nwhat access you're giving people.\n\n300\n00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.470\nAnd it might be that I\njust wanna enable myself.\n\n301\n00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:56.144\nI want me to be able to come in and\nprint through this system.\n\n302\n00:15:56.144 --> 00:15:58.410\nI'm gonna give everyone no access.\n\n303\n00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.600\nAnd me, I will have access,\nI want to be able to print.\n\n304\n00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.660\nAnd so now, not everybody on the network\ncan print through my laptop, just me.\n\n305\n00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.770\nThis makes a heck of a lot more sense,\nright?\n\n306\n00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.360\nSo if you're going to be sharing out\na printer, this is how we normally do it.\n\n307\n00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.650\nNow, I did this by coming straight\ninto sharing, I didn't have to.\n\n308\n00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:21.509\nI could have gone into printers,\npicked the printer, chose to share it.\n\n309\n00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:22.041\nAnd then,\n\n310\n00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:26.540\nwhen I went into sharing preferences it\ntakes me right to that screen, same thing.\n\n311\n00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.090\nAnd I can hit Open Printers and\nScanner Preferences to go right back.\n\n312\n00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.590\nSo the two things are linked really,\nreally it's the same system.\n\n313\n00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.260\nBut in one place,\n\n314\n00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.200\nwe actually get all the advanced\nsettings where we customize permissions.\n\n315\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.011\nIn the other we get a really light kind of\na check mark there just check it off to\n\n316\n00:16:42.011 --> 00:16:45.520\nshare it, and\nnow everyone can print to it.\n\n317\n00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.520\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff,\nsupporting printers great episode.\n\n318\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.470\nDon anything else you'd like to say?\n\n319\n00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.710\n&gt;&gt; I know it's a short one but that's\nreally about it for sharing printers.\n\n320\n00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.920\nDo be aware that if you load drivers,\nyou do need to keep them up to date.\n\n321\n00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.710\nSo you'll need the monitor,\nthe vendor's website.\n\n322\n00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.970\nDownload update the drivers\nif you need to.\n\n323\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.440\nThere are many people who'\nwill set up a print server.\n\n324\n00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.930\nSo you can take a little Mac\nrunning a Mac server app, or\n\n325\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.490\ndon't even necessarily need that.\n\n326\n00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.370\nBut you can set your printer up there.\n\n327\n00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:14.830\nAnd that way you could do printer\nredirection if you're running a lab, or\n\n328\n00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:18.680\nif you have five printers you\ncan start redirecting jobs out.\n\n329\n00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.720\nThere's some advanced functionality\nthere not used by a heck of a lot of\n\n330\n00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.690\npeople, though.\n\n331\n00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.790\nSo what we've seen here is\npretty much the basics.\n\n332\n00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.950\nI didn't mess with fax or scanners.\n\n333\n00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.250\nThat's always driven by\nthird party software.\n\n334\n00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.870\nApple does not package fax and\nscanning software with Mac OS anymore.\n\n335\n00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.130\nSo you'll need third party\nsoftware to drive those,\n\n336\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.452\nyou'll definitely need a driver for\nthose as well.\n\n337\n00:17:40.452 --> 00:17:43.180\nSo you'll have to check out\nthe website for the vendor, and\n\n338\n00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.330\nget the appropriate software.\n\n339\n00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.670\nBut otherwise, once the printer is on\nthere, it's pretty straightforward.\n\n340\n00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.650\nThere's not too much going\non in the world of printing.\n\n341\n00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.690\nThanks to a nice stable system.\n\n342\n00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.730\nAnd people's tendency to be\nmoving to digital these days.\n\n343\n00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.070\nEventually, we're gonna\nsee printers go away.\n\n344\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.160\nBut for right now, that support is still\nthere, and not too hard to work with.\n\n345\n00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.840\n&gt;&gt; Great information and well delivered.\n\n346\n00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.557\nThank you, Don.\n\n347\n00:18:02.557 --> 00:18:04.452\nAnd make

and\n\n12\n00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:36.705\nthis is a pretty interesting show\nwe're about to start here, so\n\n13\n00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:39.589\nI'm pretty excited about it.\n&gt;&gt; Because we're gonna focus on system\n\n14\n00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:41.080\ntroubleshooting.\n\n15\n00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.060\nAnd I know, if you kind of make fun of it,\nthe Apple slogan of it just works.\n\n16\n00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.020\nMacs generally do just work\nuntil they don't work.\n\n17\n00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.165\nAnd when they don't work,\nthen you've got some choices.\n\n18\n00:00:52.165 --> 00:00:53.142\nAnd a lot of times,\n\n19\n00:00:53.142 --> 00:00:56.565\nwhat we end up having to do is take\nthat Mac down to the Apple Store and\n\n20\n00:00:56.565 --> 00:01:00.220\nhave somebody at the Genius Bar\nlook at it and fix it or whatever.\n\n21\n00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.150\nBut if you're supporting these Macs,\nyou can actually learn a little about\n\n22\n00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.440\nwhat's going on during the boot process,\nduring other areas.\n\n23\n00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.140\nAnd there's a whole collection of\ntroubleshooting tools that are available\n\n24\n00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.050\nto help you solve the problem.\n\n25\n00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.740\nThe same tools they used down\nthere at the Genius Bar.\n\n26\n00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.105\nI know they call it the Genius Bar,\nbut the kids they hire,\n\n27\n00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:18.670\ntheir not special.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.070\n&gt;&gt; They're just regular old people that\n\n29\n00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.880\nread the book.\n\n30\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.470\nSo we're gonna take a look at some\nof that right here in this episode.\n\n31\n00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.200\nI'm gonna show you some of\nthe things that are going on.\n\n32\n00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.370\nFrom the moment you push the power\nbutton until you see that login screen,\n\n33\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.840\nthere's a lot of crazy stuff\nthat goes on in the background.\n\n34\n00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.380\nAnd depending on the type of\nproblem you're having, it\n\n35\n00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.070\nmay be something you could solve yourself\nif you knew the right tools to do it.\n\n36\n00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.350\nWe're gonna get a chance to see all\nof that right here in this episode.\n\n37\n00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don,\n\n38\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.010\nI guess a good place to start would be\nthat whole, you hit the start button and\n\n39\n00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.560\nthe lunacy occurs.\n\n40\n00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.240\nWhat is actually happening\nwhen I turn on my Mac?\n\n41\n00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.560\nI hit that button and it starts.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so there's actually a lot.\n\n42\n00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.460\nThere's different scenarios\nthat kinda muddle this and\n\n43\n00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.360\nmake it a little more complex.\n\n44\n00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.050\nSo let's try and go simple here.\n\n45\n00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.920\nLet's say you buy a brand new Mac and\nyou just took it out of the box,\n\n46\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.760\nyou open the lid and\nyou push the power button, all right?\n\n47\n00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.920\nWhat's gonna happen is it's\ngonna go through five phases.\n\n48\n00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.750\nThe moment you connect that power contact,\nthat's what's initiating the first phase.\n\n49\n00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.283\nThat's where the firmware\non the motherboard,\n\n50\n00:02:22.283 --> 00:02:24.997\nin the PC world we usually\nrefer to it as the BIOS, but\n\n51\n00:02:24.997 --> 00:02:28.660\nthe firmware on that motherboard,\nit's like a miniature computer.\n\n52\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.527\nThat as soon as it receives power, it has\na very simplified set of instructions to\n\n53\n00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:38.035\ntell it what to do to go and turn on the\nrest of the hardware, and then to go and\n\n54\n00:02:38.035 --> 00:02:39.915\nkick of the boot process.\n\n55\n00:02:39.915 --> 00:02:42.150\nSo that firmware kicks in.\n\n56\n00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.918\nThen it moves over to\nwhat's called the booter.\n\n57\n00:02:44.918 --> 00:02:48.835\nAnd the booter's job is to\nfind the operating system and\n\n58\n00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.093\nstart the operating system up.\n\n59\n00:02:51.093 --> 00:02:52.617\nWhen it finds the operating system,\n\n60\n00:02:52.617 --> 00:02:55.380\nthe operating system has this key\nfile that's called the kernel.\n\n61\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.620\nAnd the kernel is the heart and\nsoul of your operating system.\n\n62\n00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.880\nAnd that's when Mac OS is now firing up.\n\n63\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.040\nAnd then the kernel needs to\nlaunch all these other programs.\n\n64\n00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.970\nAnd so it calls launchd,\nwhich is the launch daemon.\n\n65\n00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.050\nIt's a little service that\nruns in the background and\n\n66\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.800\nit in turn launches all of the other\nsystem services that are required to run.\n\n67\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.720\nAnd then when launchd is done,\n\n68\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.310\nit fires up the log in window\nwhich is what we see as a user.\n\n69\n00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.950\nSo it was five phases went\nfrom firmware to booter\n\n70\n00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.180\nto colonel to launchd to log in window,\nright.\n\n71\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.240\nNow all of that is hidden.\n\n72\n00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.290\nYou push the power button and\nyou see the Apple logo and\n\n73\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.110\nyou see a little white\nbar that crawls across.\n\n74\n00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.590\nAnd then you see a login screen.\n\n75\n00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.080\nSo it went through all five phases and\nall you saw was an apple with a bar.\n\n76\n00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.160\nAnd no real interactivity there,\nand you're at the login window, and\n\n77\n00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.380\nyou're at the fifth phase.\n\n78\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.710\nWell, the reality is there are a number of\nthings that could go wrong anywhere along\n\n79\n00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.050\nthat process and derail you.\n\n80\n00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.800\nAnd the tools you use to\ntroubleshoot it are gonna vary,\n\n81\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.330\nbased on which of those five phases it\nfell in, so we need to understand what's\n\n82\n00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.940\nhappening where to be able to pick\nthe right tools to solve our problem.\n\n83\n00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.450\nIt's one of the challenges of being in IT\nsupport is we have to deal with the stuff\n\n84\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.890\nthat doesn't just work and\nwe've gotta get in and figure that out.\n\n85\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.290\nSo it's a pretty neat process,\n\n86\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.190\nall the stuff that goes on,\nI said picture a brand new Mac.\n\n87\n00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.980\nAnd the reason I said that was\nto try to avoid complexity.\n\n88\n00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.330\nIf you've already started using a Mac,\nat some point,\n\n89\n00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.950\nit's asked you if you\nwanna enable FileVault.\n\n90\n00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.100\nAnd you probably have,\nmost of us should have.\n\n91\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.750\nIf you've enabled FileVault,\nthere's a little more to it, right?\n\n92\n00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.740\nBecause you actually get the log\nin screen prior to launchd and\n\n93\n00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.938\nprior to login window and\nprior to all these things coming up.\n\n94\n00:04:42.938 --> 00:04:46.451\nBecause it's gotta be able to get you to\nauthenticate to unlock the private key so\n\n95\n00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:49.252\nit can then access the hard drive\nthat has the operating system.\n\n96\n00:04:49.252 --> 00:04:54.297\nSo it's almost like there's a sixth phase\nthat we could inject that the firmware\n\n97\n00:04:54.297 --> 00:04:59.190\nkicks on, it reaches out to the booter,\nbut the booter instead of going to find\n\n98\n00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.812\nthe operating system, launches\nthe FileVault authentication screen.\n\n99\n00:05:03.812 --> 00:05:06.875\nYour authenticate with FileVault,\nthat unlocks the hard drive and\n\n100\n00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:10.097\nthen the booter can go and find\nthe operating system on the hard drive and\n\n101\n00:05:10.097 --> 00:05:11.890\ncontinue the rest of the boot.\n\n102\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.750\nSo after phase two we could say there's\n\n103\n00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.860\nlike a phase 2.5 if we wanted to\ninject FileVault into the mix,\n\n104\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.570\nwhich most of us should have, but it means\nthat login window is reflected early.\n\n105\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.080\nAnd we're gonna talk more about\nFileVault in another episode,\n\n106\n00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.770\nbecause that login window we're\nseeing is not a real login window.\n\n107\n00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.350\nIt's actually just doing\ncredential unlock and\n\n108\n00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.580\nthen when you get to the real login window\nit's already got your credentials so\n\n109\n00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.860\nit passes you right through,\nand you just don't see it.\n\n110\n00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.310\nBut it is actually there.\n\n111\n00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.810\nAgain, it's like a hidden phase,\n\n112\n00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.460\nthat's why it's important to know these.\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, you talked about,\n\n113\n00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.460\nyou get a brand new Mac or any brand\nnew computer, you press power and\n\n114\n00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.050\neverything just starts to work.\n\n115\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.640\nAnd we forget that a lot of times,\n\n116\n00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.221\nas support professionals,\neverything we work on is broken.\n\n117\n00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:56.730\n[LAUGH] So we have to keep that in mind,\nthat every computer that you see,\n\n118\n00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.290\nthat someone brings to you and says\nthis doesn't work, well it doesn't work.\n\n119\n00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.110\nSo we have to figure out what's going\nwrong and where it's going wrong so\n\n120\n00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.860\nwe can fix that.\n\n121\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.090\nAnd that being said,\nyou talk about the five phases, Don.\n\n122\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.800\nI think it would be a good idea for\n\n123\n00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.730\nus to look at a more microscopic\nview of each of those phases.\n\n124\n00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.480\nThat way we can tell what\nshould be happening so\n\n125\n00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.460\nwe can find out where it's going awry.\n\n126\n00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.900\nSo let's start with that firmware\nprocess and work our way through.\n\n127\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.240\nWhat do you say?\n&gt;&gt; Sure, absolutely.\n\n128\n00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.480\nNow the firmware process,\nthat's the first one.\n\n129\n00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.470\nYou push the contact on that button and\nit connects two little bars and\n\n130\n00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.160\na transistor and all of a sudden\nthe system knows to do stuff, right?\n\n131\n00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.440\nIt wakes up, but the reality is when you\nplug a power cable into the computer,\n\n132\n00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.690\neven if the computer is off,\nmodern motherboards are actually on.\n\n133\n00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.810\nBecause there's features like wake on LAN,\nand\n\n134\n00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.570\nother stuff,\nwhere they need power for that.\n\n135\n00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.610\nSo it's sitting there consuming a very,\nvery incredible small amount of energy\n\n136\n00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.420\njust watching for\nyou to push that power button, and\n\n137\n00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.590\nthe moment you push that power button\nthe firmeware wakes up, right?\n\n138\n00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.460\nIt wakes up and it starts to do its work.\n\n139\n00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.010\nNow the first piece of work that\nit does is what's called a post or\n\n140\n00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.200\na power on self test.\n\n141\n00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.670\nIt looks at your hardware and\nit says, I'm expecting to find a CPU,\n\n142\n00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.430\nI'm expecting to find RAM,\nI don't know how much.\n\n143\n00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.390\nBut there's going to be some RAM.\n\n144\n00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:14.090\nI'm expecting to find\na video output device, right?\n\n145\n00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.690\nThere's some things that\nit's not expecting to find.\n\n146\n00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.730\nIt's like,\nit's not expecting to find a sound card.\n\n147\n00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.410\nIt doesn't care if you have sound or not.\n\n148\n00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.290\nIt's not expecting to find a hard drive,\n\n149\n00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.480\nbecause there's any number of\ndifferent types of hard drives.\n\n150\n00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.230\nHeck, I might even want to boot off a USB\nkey, right, or boot off the network,\n\n151\n00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.770\nso it doesn't look for a hard drive.\n\n152\n00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.670\nIt's just looking for the key things\nthat it needs to make the computer work,\n\n153\n00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.010\nto just make it light up.\n\n154\n00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.550\nLet us see something on the screen, right.\n\n155\n00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.760\nThat's what it's doing.\n\n156\n00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.070\nOn a positive side, that means\nfirmware is very, very simple, right.\n\n157\n00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.246\nVery, very stable and the odds are nothing\nshould go wrong with it, right.\n\n158\n00:07:49.246 --> 00:07:52.294\nBut on the negative side,\nif something does go wrong,\n\n159\n00:07:52.294 --> 00:07:54.759\nit usually means it's a hardware problem.\n\n160\n00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.621\nIt's not a software problem on a PC.\n\n161\n00:07:58.621 --> 00:08:03.609\nFor example if I had a PC, right, when I\npush that power button there's a little\n\n162\n00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:08.672\nbrief moment where it'll say something\nlike, press F1 or F2, press delete or\n\n163\n00:08:08.672 --> 00:08:13.020\nALT F1 some crazy key combination\nto get into the BIOS settings.\n\n164\n00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.360\nAnd I can go in to any of those\nsettings and I could tweak things and\n\n165\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.160\nconfigure it and change it and whatever.\n\n166\n00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.600\nIn the PC world they\nhave to do that because\n\n167\n00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.790\nthere's not a standard configuration.\n\n168\n00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.980\nThere's all sorts of different hardware,\nit's the Wild West.\n\n169\n00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.020\nMaybe you have Intel CPUs or AMD CPUs,\n\n170\n00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.540\nmaybe you've got different\ntypes of memory.\n\n171\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.240\nIt's craziness.\n\n172\n00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.820\nBut in the Apple world,\nApple makes all the hardware.\n\n173\n00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.690\nThey know the computers that are there.\n\n174\n00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.860\nThey know exactly what CPU is gonna\nbe there, they know exactly what\n\n175\n00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.700\nmemory is going to be there and\nwhat manufacturer made these parts.\n\n176\n00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.520\nThey know all that.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n177\n00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.770\nthey don't like you\nmessing with it either,\n\n178\n00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.670\ndo they?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not, right?\n\n179\n00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:51.570\nAnd why would you need to mess with it\nif you've got a fixed configuration of\n\n180\n00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.270\nhardware, so that firmware,\nApple doesn't let you get into it.\n\n181\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.850\nYou can upgrade it, it does get\nupdates through the app store and\n\n182\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.130\nthrough other means but\nyou can't change it.\n\n183\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.320\nYou can't go into\nthe firmware on a Mac and\n\n184\n00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.290\nmake modifications,\nthey have their standard hardware.\n\n185\n00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.470\nAnd if you're getting a failure, it means\nyou no longer have standard hardware.\n\n186\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.350\nNow, all right, maybe you cracked\nit open you took something out,\n\n187\n00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.820\nyou can do that with some of the devices.\n\n188\n00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:23.230\nBut more and more like my Mac mini\nhere this is a 2014 model Mac mini,\n\n189\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.120\nbut it's only a year old they just\nhaven't refreshed cuz they hate me or\n\n190\n00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.680\nsomething.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n191\n00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.980\n&gt;&gt; But if I open this up,\n\n192\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.760\neverything is soldered on the motherboard,\neverything, the memory, the processor,\n\n193\n00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.990\nthe RAM or just the memory.\n\n194\n00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.040\nI guess the hard drive is not soldered on.\n\n195\n00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.080\nBut they only give you one expansion data,\nyou can like six or second drive in there.\n\n196\n00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.550\nSo it's very fixed configuration.\n\n197\n00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.460\nSo not a lot can go wrong here, but\n\n198\n00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.710\nwhen it does, it's usually gonna\nmanifest itself in a pretty bad way.\n\n199\n00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:58.860\nEither one, you push the power button and\nthe system starts to boot,\n\n200\n00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.440\nbut you just get black screen and\nyou never actually see anything, right?\n\n201\n00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.610\nThat's one way it manifests.\n\n202\n00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.560\nSometimes you push the power button and\nyou hear the Mac gong.\n\n203\n00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.462\nYou hear the [SOUND] but then, nothing,\nnothing on the screen no video,\n\n204\n00:10:12.462 --> 00:10:14.926\nnothing else beyond that, right?\n\n205\n00:10:14.926 --> 00:10:17.692\nYou may actually see where\nyou push the power button and\n\n206\n00:10:17.692 --> 00:10:20.230\nthe power light flashes,\nbut no gong, no video.\n\n207\n00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.120\nOr you might see where you push the power\nbutton and absolutely nothing happens.\n\n208\n00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.450\n&gt;&gt; That's absolute nightmare scenario.\n\n209\n00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no light, no sound.\n\n210\n00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.450\nWell I guess there's varying degrees\nof nightmare on this one right?\n\n211\n00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.375\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n212\n00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:35.887\n&gt;&gt; On a Mac mini or on a desktop,\n\n213\n00:10:35.887 --> 00:10:38.410\nthe power supply's\nactually a separate unit.\n\n214\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.950\nIt's just jammed inside of the case,\n\n215\n00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.050\nso you can replace the power\nsupply if it fails.\n\n216\n00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.870\nIf the power supply itself has failed,\nand you push the power button,\n\n217\n00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.270\nyou're not gonna get the light,\nit's just dead.\n\n218\n00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.150\nCould be the device is unplugged, right?\n&gt;&gt; That's always true.\n\n219\n00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.660\n&gt;&gt; Always a good idea to check that.\n\n220\n00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.850\nBut otherwise,\nit could be a failed power supply.\n\n221\n00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.000\nYou're gonna have to take that\none in to get it replaced.\n\n222\n00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.470\nOr if your unit's not under warranty,\nyou could shop EBay and find one.\n\n223\n00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.910\nBut used power supplies are typically\neither A not reliable or B counterfeit.\n\n224\n00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.680\nThere are tons of counterfeit\nmanufacturers out there for Apple hardware\n\n225\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.370\nand it's not gonna be reliable.\n&gt;&gt; So if a deal's too good\n\n226\n00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.900\nto be true it probably is kind of thing?\n&gt;&gt; In\n\n227\n00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.350\nnowhere is that more true\nthan laptop power adapters.\n\n228\n00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:20.970\nThat Apple just did a study not but\na few months ago where on Amazon,\n\n229\n00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.150\nthey ordered ten adapters from ten,\n\n230\n00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.320\nor I guess one adapter from ten\ndifferent dealers on Amazon, and\n\n231\n00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.510\nnine of the ten were counterfeit.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n232\n00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.030\n&gt;&gt; And when you use a counterfeit adapter\n\n233\n00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.920\nlike that, the adapter will\nfail usually before the device.\n\n234\n00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.640\nBut they can actually damage the device\nif there's any incorrect voltage, or\n\n235\n00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.970\nwattage, or whatever.\n\n236\n00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.590\nSo you gotta be careful\nwith things like that.\n\n237\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.330\nAny third party parts are always iffy.\n\n238\n00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.280\nBut sometimes it's not hardware.\n\n239\n00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.270\nSometimes it might seems like it's\nhardware but it's actually not.\n\n240\n00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.960\nOr it may be hardware but you just can't\ntell cuz you're not getting video output.\n\n241\n00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.746\nSo there is a need tool\nbuilt into every Mac.\n\n242\n00:11:56.746 --> 00:12:01.123\nIf you're not seeing the light flash or\nyou're not seeing the video output or\n\n243\n00:12:01.123 --> 00:12:04.250\nwhatever, you can try and\nrun hardware diagnostics.\n\n244\n00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:08.480\nIf you call Apple on the phone, and\nyou tell them, hey my Mac blew up.\n\n245\n00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.682\nI need a warranty exchange.\n\n246\n00:12:09.682 --> 00:12:14.270\nThey're gonna tell you take it\ndown to an Apple store, and\n\n247\n00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.580\nhave them run a diagnostic.\n\n248\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.140\nAnd they're gonna generate a code and\n\n249\n00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.090\nthat code has to be sent to Apple before\nthey approve the warranty return.\n\n250\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.890\nThat has to be done.\n\n251\n00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.420\nWell, I can tell you\nthe diagnostic that they run.\n\n252\n00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.170\nIt's really easy.\n\n253\n00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.730\nYou just power on the Mac while holding\ndown the letter D on the keyboard.\n\n254\n00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.870\nYou hold D,\nit goes into the hardware diagnostic.\n\n255\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.120\nIt's not science.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n256\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.510\n&gt;&gt; It's just not heavily documented.\n\n257\n00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.190\n&gt;&gt; You're not whipping out like\n\n258\n00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.300\nmultimeters and stuff.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, maybe.\n\n259\n00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.460\n&gt;&gt; Not a Jacob's Ladder going on next\n\n260\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:41.990\nto you.\n\n261\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Like mixing chemicals in\n\n262\n00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.067\nthe vial.\n&gt;&gt; We've gotta get into this thing Don.\n\n263\n00:12:46.067 --> 00:12:48.826\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; David Copperfield does not visit each\n\n264\n00:12:48.826 --> 00:12:49.710\nMac store.\n\n265\n00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.550\nNow, if it won't power on at all,\nthe hardware diagnostic's not gonna\n\n266\n00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.150\nrun, right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n267\n00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.700\n&gt;&gt; Then you do, you gotta go down there.\n\n268\n00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.560\nBut it could be something simple.\n\n269\n00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.090\nI'll give you a great example.\n\n270\n00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:03.910\nThe MacBook that I had prior to this one,\nI had a I think\n\n271\n00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:08.220\nit was a 2012 MacBook, was it that old\n&gt;&gt; No, No,\n\n272\n00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:13.150\nI think you had like a 2015 or 2014.\n&gt;&gt; My previous one was, but whatever that\n\n273\n00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:18.700\nMacBook was, it ran great, but all of\na sudden the sound stopped working, right.\n\n274\n00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.675\nIt was a strange thing, I would start\ngetting static with headphones first, and\n\n275\n00:13:21.675 --> 00:13:24.230\nthen ultimately,\nthe sound just died out all together.\n\n276\n00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:28.400\nNo sound with headphones plugged in, no\nsounds with headphones unplugged, and if\n\n277\n00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.160\nyou went in to the volume mixer, it didn't\neven show the internal speakers at all.\n\n278\n00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.470\nIt's really odd.\nThe sound card,\n\n279\n00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.660\nwhich is integrated to\nthe motherboard had died.\n\n280\n00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.560\nIt just shorted out and died.\n\n281\n00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.090\nWell, I ran the diagnostic tool,\nand it flagged it.\n\n282\n00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:42.960\nIt showed it.\nIt said, hey,\n\n283\n00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.890\nyour sound card is dead.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.460\n&gt;&gt; It actually said the sound card is\n\n285\n00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.880\nmissing, which is its own problem because\nit integrated in the motherboard.\n\n286\n00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.023\nIt's not like I cut it out.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n287\n00:13:50.023 --> 00:13:51.700\n&gt;&gt; So that was a problem.\n\n288\n00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.360\nIt wasn't enough to stop the device from\nworking, remember I said the firmware,\n\n289\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.710\nit doesn't care if you have a sound card.\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz this is not mission critical\n\n290\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.910\npiece of equipment inside the Mac.\n&gt;&gt; No, maybe if you work in\n\n291\n00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:05.960\nthe music industry but for me it's not.\n&gt;&gt; To make the Mac actually run,\n\n292\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.780\nI mean.\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, we don't care,\n\n293\n00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.690\nit doesn't care.\n\n294\n00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.960\nYou can boot up, the OS fires up\nfine you just don't hear anything.\n\n295\n00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.150\nIn fact I was kinda busy so\n\n296\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.350\nI didn't have time to take it\ndown to the shop to get it fixed.\n\n297\n00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.580\nSo I just stuck a USB sound card on it and\nthat worked fine.\n\n298\n00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.340\n&gt;&gt; Back in action.\n\n299\n00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.470\n&gt;&gt; Ran for like three months that way\n\n300\n00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.650\nbefore I finally just took it down and\ngot it fixed.\n\n301\n00:14:27.135 --> 00:14:30.115\nThat's kinda a work around,\nif you know to look for it.\n\n302\n00:14:30.115 --> 00:14:31.895\nSo let me show you that diagnostic mode.\n\n303\n00:14:31.895 --> 00:14:35.945\nSo I've go my trusty Mac mini here,\nwhich I'm gonna shut down.\n\n304\n00:14:35.945 --> 00:14:39.685\nI left it logged in, so\nlet me shut this thing down.\n\n305\n00:14:39.685 --> 00:14:44.535\nAnd once it's shut down,\nif we want to run that hardware\n\n306\n00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:48.490\ndiagnostic we just need to wait for\nit to be fully powered off, right?\n\n307\n00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:52.090\nThis doesn't work on a simple reboot,\nyou actually do have to power it off.\n\n308\n00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:52.890\nSo I'm gonna power it off and\n\n309\n00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.660\nDaniel, if you can let me know\nwhen that light goes out.\n\n310\n00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.160\n&gt;&gt; I'm watching it like a hawk.\n\n311\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.657\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes with Mac minis,\n\n312\n00:14:57.657 --> 00:15:00.259\nwhen you have FileVault and\nall that turned on,\n\n313\n00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:02.590\nit take a while to actually boot.\n&gt;&gt; And you're good.\n\n314\n00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:03.542\n&gt;&gt; It's good, okay.\n\n315\n00:15:03.542 --> 00:15:06.204\nSo now I'm just gonna hold\nthe letter D on my keyboard.\n\n316\n00:15:06.204 --> 00:15:09.275\nAnd while I'm holding the letter D,\nI'm gonna hit that power button.\n\n317\n00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:13.661\nAnd it's gonna fire up and you should\nhear the gong I'm not gonna hear the gong\n\n318\n00:15:13.661 --> 00:15:15.836\nright now cuz HDMI's got me my audio.\n\n319\n00:15:15.836 --> 00:15:20.752\nBut it's gonna power on and it will\nsee that I'm holding the letter D, and\n\n320\n00:15:20.752 --> 00:15:26.320\nwhen it sees that, it's gonna launch\nin to the hardware diagnostics, okay.\n\n321\n00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:32.010\nNow, normally when you have a retina\nscreen, it does this beautiful scaling and\n\n322\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.500\none pixel becomes four and\neverything looks sharp and pristine.\n\n323\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.580\nWhen you go into the hardware diagnostics\nall that stuff is gone, and so\n\n324\n00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.550\nthe text is really small.\n\n325\n00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.849\nIf you're standing there in person\nyou can read it, it kinda works out.\n\n326\n00:15:43.849 --> 00:15:46.473\nBut let me, I'm gonna zoom in on this,\nbut just know in,\n\n327\n00:15:46.473 --> 00:15:48.022\nin real life it's really small.\n\n328\n00:15:48.022 --> 00:15:50.386\nBut basically, what it does is\nit brings you up a menu, and\n\n329\n00:15:50.386 --> 00:15:52.045\nit just says what language do you speak?\n\n330\n00:15:52.045 --> 00:15:55.405\nBecause it can run the hardware diagnostic\nin any number of languages, and\n\n331\n00:15:55.405 --> 00:15:59.240\nthen if you got in here by accident,\nyou can choose to restart or shut it down.\n\n332\n00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.590\nThat's it, it just wants to\nknow what language you speak.\n\n333\n00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:07.046\nAnd I'll go in here and choose one,\nand I have to be careful here, cuz I'm\n\n334\n00:16:07.046 --> 00:16:13.036\non a magic touch pad, but the magic touch\npad it's nice because it's wireless.\n\n335\n00:16:13.036 --> 00:16:16.287\nBut let me caution you, it doesn't wake up\non it's own when you're in the hardware\n\n336\n00:16:16.287 --> 00:16:19.580\ndiagnostics, so you kinda have to\nclick at least once to wake it up.\n\n337\n00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.312\nAnd if you click twice by accident you\ncould pick one of the other languages.\n\n338\n00:16:23.312 --> 00:16:24.470\nAnd I've done this.\n\n339\n00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:28.720\nAnd then before you know it you're running\nthe Hungarian hardware diagnostics, and\n\n340\n00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.030\nthat doesn't help all that much.\n\n341\n00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.698\nAlthough, the codes are universal, so\n\n342\n00:16:31.698 --> 00:16:33.670\nif you just wait you do\neventually get the code.\n\n343\n00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.930\nSo anyhow, I woke up my little magic\ntouchpad and now I can choose English.\n\n344\n00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.716\nSo I'll go ahead and pick that,\njust put a little check mark on there and\n\n345\n00:16:40.716 --> 00:16:42.030\nthen it's gonna run.\n\n346\n00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:45.340\nNow while it's running,\nthere's not much for me to do.\n\n347\n00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.770\nIn fact, it's kind of boring in\nthe general scheme of things.\n\n348\n00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:52.230\nIt just says that it's checking my Mac and\nI've got two minutes remaining.\n\n349\n00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.485\nThere's no options here.\n\n350\n00:16:54.485 --> 00:16:58.406\nIn some of the older MacBooks you could\naccess this hardware diagnostic by Cmd+D,\n\n351\n00:16:58.406 --> 00:17:01.823\nand it would take you to a different\nscreen where it would actually let you\n\n352\n00:17:01.823 --> 00:17:03.910\npick the tests that were run.\n\n353\n00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.580\nBut what Apple found was that most\npeople were skipping the memory tests.\n\n354\n00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.830\nBecause they would say, I've got a bad\nhard drive, or I've got a bad sound card.\n\n355\n00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:13.670\nAnd it would actually turn\nout to be a memory failure\n\n356\n00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.520\nbecause everything passes through RAM.\n\n357\n00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.242\nSo the sound card might be perfectly fine,\nbut when its data gets sent through RAM,\n\n358\n00:17:20.242 --> 00:17:22.312\nif the RAM is bad,\nit's gonna get messed up and\n\n359\n00:17:22.312 --> 00:17:24.770\nit's going to seem like\nthe sound card is bad.\n\n360\n00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.870\nSo they now have just basically\nmade it where when you launch this,\n\n361\n00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.450\nit starts running the full diagnostic.\n\n362\n00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:34.980\nNow in the background, it's checking\nyour RAM, it's checking your CPU,\n\n363\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.910\nit's looking for\nhardware that it expects to find.\n\n364\n00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.180\nNot that it needs, but\nthat it expects to find.\n\n365\n00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.610\nIt looks at your serial number, and\n\n366\n00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.250\nsays according to the serial number, here\nis the hardware that should be present.\n\n367\n00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.237\nNow if you're not connected\nto the Internet, well,\n\n368\n00:17:48.237 --> 00:17:51.080\nactually it doesn't matter, cuz this\ndoesn't phone out to the Internet.\n\n369\n00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.822\nIt doesn't know necessarily if you picked\n8 gigs of RAM or 16 gigs of RAM, so\n\n370\n00:17:54.822 --> 00:17:57.630\nthere's variation there, or\nthe size of the hard drive.\n\n371\n00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.476\nBut it knows you're supposed to have RAM.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n372\n00:17:59.476 --> 00:18:01.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it knows you're supposed to have\n\n373\n00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.950\na hard drive.\n\n374\n00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.980\nAnd so it's looking for those things and\ntrying to chart that out and map it.\n\n375\n00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.070\nThat whole scan is\nactually pretty complex.\n\n376\n00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.980\nWe don't see it, right?\n\n377\n00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.210\nWe just get this.\n\n378\n00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.360\nWhen it's done you get this\nwhole output right here.\n\n379\n00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.895\nAnd the bigger your hard drive, the more\nRAM you have, the longer this test takes.\n\n380\n00:18:19.895 --> 00:18:21.490\nMine took two minutes, not too bad.\n\n381\n00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.580\nI think my little Mac Mini has 8 gigs\nof RAM and just a 250 gig hard drive,\n\n382\n00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.370\nbut it's an SSD, so it scans fast as well.\n\n383\n00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.520\nWhen it's done,\nit gives you the information you need for\n\n384\n00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.780\na warranty exchange.\n\n385\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.225\nIt tells you, I can see right here,\nmy reference code.\n\n386\n00:18:35.225 --> 00:18:37.826\nMy reference code is useless right now.\n\n387\n00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:42.280\nADP, which is the Apple Diagnostic\nProgram, I think is what it stands for.\n\n388\n00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.320\nEither way, I got code 0000\nwhich means everything is fine,\n\n389\n00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.660\nstop calling us.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n390\n00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.166\n&gt;&gt; If it said anything else like\n\n391\n00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:52.802\nwhen my sound card was bad,\nit was a much longer code that said, hey,\n\n392\n00:18:52.802 --> 00:18:55.160\nthe sound card's missing, right?\n\n393\n00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.812\nAnd then after that it tells\nyou what you can do with it.\n\n394\n00:18:57.812 --> 00:19:00.830\nIt tells you, hey,\nyou can try and boot to recovery.\n\n395\n00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.460\nThe problem you have is most\nlikely a software problem.\n\n396\n00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.920\nIn my case, it's saying, hey, if you've\ngot a problem, it's probably software, so\n\n397\n00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.070\nwhy don't you go into recovery and\ntry and fix it that way.\n\n398\n00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:11.110\nHere's your serial number, though.\n\n399\n00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.460\nIf you take that serial number and\n\n400\n00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.180\nthat code, call up Apple,\nyou can start the warranty process.\n\n401\n00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:16.880\nReally useful for\n\n402\n00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.530\npeople who don't live in a town where\nthere's a, either an Apple store or\n\n403\n00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:25.310\na Apple authorized warranty provider.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, once we've made it through\n\n404\n00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:29.310\nthis firmware process and you've given us\na good breakdown how that operates, and\n\n405\n00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:33.450\nif we do see some trouble what we can\ndo to try to alleviate that issue.\n\n406\n00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.160\n&gt;&gt; But then we move into the booter phase,\n\n407\n00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.530\nif I'm not mistaken,\nif I'm remembering correctly.\n\n408\n00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.300\nSo if we made it this far,\nbooter would be our next stop\n\n409\n00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.250\non the journey, correct?\n&gt;&gt; Right, so assuming there's no hardware\n\n410\n00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.828\nerrors, I'm just going to tell this\nthing to restart here while I jabber on.\n\n411\n00:19:46.828 --> 00:19:49.530\nSo assuming there's no hardware error,\n\n412\n00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:53.450\nright, then the firmware does its job,\nwhich is what we're seeing right now.\n\n413\n00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.150\nThis black screen is\nthe firmware doing its job.\n\n414\n00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.090\nAnd then, it reaches out to the booter and\nthe booter goes to find the OS.\n\n415\n00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.860\nWhen the booter finds the OS,\nthat's when the Apple appears.\n\n416\n00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.980\nI see the Apple now.\n\n417\n00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.780\nPrior to that, the black screens, it was\nactually two different black screens.\n\n418\n00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.250\nOne was the firmware and one was\nthe booter, but we just see it as a single\n\n419\n00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.410\nblack screen element.\n&gt;&gt; And then it finds the OS, and\n\n420\n00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.000\nturns things over to the kernel, right?\n\n421\n00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.030\nSo that was that kinda\nnext progression there.\n\n422\n00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:23.500\nThe booter has to find\nan operating system.\n\n423\n00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.830\nIf it doesn't,\nlet's say it looked at my system, and\n\n424\n00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.890\nit couldn't find an operating system.\n\n425\n00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.915\nThen what's it gonna do?\n\n426\n00:20:30.915 --> 00:20:34.540\nWell, it's gonna give us,\ndepending on your Mac,\n\n427\n00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.810\nyou could get a couple of errors.\n\n428\n00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.640\nYou'll usually see either a message\nsaying, operating system not found, or\n\n429\n00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.550\nyou'll see a folder with a question\nmark on it, which indicates I can't find\n\n430\n00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.790\nthe folder that's holding\nthe operating system, right?\n\n431\n00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.390\nYou can also see what's\ncalled the sad Mac.\n\n432\n00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:53.803\nThe sad Mac is a little picture of an old\nApple SE2 or SE 20, and it's got x's\n\n433\n00:20:53.803 --> 00:20:58.108\non its eyes and a frowny face, sad Mac.\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like\n\n434\n00:20:58.108 --> 00:21:02.721\nthe dead Mac with x's on the eyes.\n&gt;&gt; In the olden days,\n\n435\n00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:07.623\non the SE 20s if you had a crash,\nyou would actually hear a car crash.\n\n436\n00:21:07.623 --> 00:21:09.030\nIt would go [SOUND].\n&gt;&gt; Did you really?\n\n437\n00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.404\nThat's funny.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n438\n00:21:10.404 --> 00:21:14.095\nit's changed, it evolved a good bit.\n&gt;&gt; You could bring\n\n439\n00:21:14.095 --> 00:21:15.101\nthat back.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n440\n00:21:15.101 --> 00:21:18.096\nthey like to have a little bit of\nfun with it, and it is fun for us.\n\n441\n00:21:18.096 --> 00:21:22.496\nBut imagine you're working\non your doctoral thesis, and\n\n442\n00:21:22.496 --> 00:21:24.575\nall of a sudden it crashes.\n\n443\n00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:26.320\nYou're not really up for\nhumor at that point.\n\n444\n00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.447\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n445\n00:21:27.447 --> 00:21:29.298\nThat's when the pump sprayer\nfull of diesel fuel comes in.\n\n446\n00:21:29.298 --> 00:21:29.838\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n447\n00:21:29.838 --> 00:21:33.970\nthat's when people really get\npassionate about your products.\n\n448\n00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.450\nSo the booter, what's it doing?\n\n449\n00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.600\nWell, the booter is\ninteracting with the firmware.\n\n450\n00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.960\nThe firmware calls it.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n451\n00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.970\nthe booter's trying to\nfind an operating system.\n\n452\n00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.560\nAnd the way that's done on most modern\ncomputers, not just Apple, but really any,\n\n453\n00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.994\nif you buy a competitor computer,\nwhatever, they're doing this, too.\n\n454\n00:21:49.994 --> 00:21:54.586\nThey use what's called EFI,\nright, which is\n\n455\n00:21:54.586 --> 00:22:00.590\nthe Extensible Firmware Image booter.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n456\n00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:03.950\n&gt;&gt; It's a standard way of saying\n\n457\n00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.500\nhere's an operating system and\nwhere you can find it, right?\n\n458\n00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.130\nSo you might have a computer that\nruns more than one operating system,\n\n459\n00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.060\nlike right here.\n\n460\n00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.530\nMaybe I'm doing boot camp.\n\n461\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.620\nAnd so I've Windows on a partition and\nI've got Mac OS on a partition, okay.\n\n462\n00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.180\nWorks great, I can do that.\n\n463\n00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:23.670\nWell, there's an EFI boot file for\nMac OS and an EFI boot file for Windows.\n\n464\n00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:26.530\nSo when the booter fires up it looks for\nthose EFI files and\n\n465\n00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.500\nit says, who can I find, right?\n\n466\n00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.200\nFrom Mac, it's looking for\none file in particular.\n\n467\n00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.150\nSo let me get into my terminal here and\n\n468\n00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:38.308\nI'll show you if we want to kinda\nbrowse around in here and see it.\n\n469\n00:22:38.308 --> 00:22:41.990\nIt's right on the hard drive, which brings\nup the whole thing about FileVault.\n\n470\n00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.280\nIf your hard drive's encrypted,\npretty hard for\n\n471\n00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.690\nthe booter to find what it's looking for,\nright?\n\n472\n00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:51.380\nSo that's why FileVault has to unlock\nbefore we can move into booting the OS,\n\n473\n00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.670\nthat's the kind of phase 2.5 I mentioned.\n\n474\n00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:58.475\nIn my case, I do have FileVault turned on,\nor at least I think I do.\n\n475\n00:22:58.475 --> 00:23:00.170\n[LAUGH] I guess I should verify that.\n\n476\n00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.510\nIf you jump into your System Preferences,\nyou can go to Privacy and Security, and\n\n477\n00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:07.820\nyou'll find out real quick whether or\nnot you've got firewall turned on.\n\n478\n00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.810\nIt will showed up buried in here and\n\n479\n00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.940\nI can see,\nactually I don't have firewall turned on.\n\n480\n00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.840\nI really should.\n\n481\n00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.920\nI should evaluate my security practices.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good job, Don.\n\n482\n00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.940\n&gt;&gt; But anyhow so\n\n483\n00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.660\nI'm not even going to turn it on.\n\n484\n00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.000\nThat means when the booter fires up,\n\n485\n00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.180\nit is able just to look right at the hard\ndrive and go and find this file.\n\n486\n00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:30.630\nAnd what it's looking for\non most systems, like on a Linux system,\n\n487\n00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.140\nit would be in a folder called /Boot.\n\n488\n00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.150\nThat's where it puts it.\n\n489\n00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:39.820\nIn Windows, it puts it in, I think,\n/Windows/EFI, if I remember right.\n\n490\n00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.176\nBut it might be /Windows/System32.\n\n491\n00:23:42.176 --> 00:23:43.680\nI can't remember on that one.\n\n492\n00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.883\nBut on Mac,\nit tucks it away in a very specific place.\n\n493\n00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:53.289\nIt puts it into /System\n/Library/CoreServices.\n\n494\n00:23:53.289 --> 00:23:54.614\nThat folder right there.\n\n495\n00:23:54.614 --> 00:23:58.219\nIf you browse into\n/System/Library/CoreServices, and\n\n496\n00:23:58.219 --> 00:24:03.700\ntake a look at all the files in there,\nthere's quite a bit of stuff in there.\n\n497\n00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.630\nBuried in here somewhere,\nyou'll find a file called boot.efi.\n\n498\n00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:13.430\nThere it is right there,\nthat's it, boot.efi, okay.\n\n499\n00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:14.430\nIt's a binary file.\n\n500\n00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:15.850\nI can't open it and show you the contents.\n\n501\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:17.390\nBut it's a very small file.\n\n502\n00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:22.720\nAnd basically, what it says is all\nthe information that the booter needs to\n\n503\n00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.430\nbe able to boot Mac OS, it says, there's\nan operating system here called Mac OS.\n\n504\n00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.220\nAnd if you want to boot it,\n\n505\n00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.390\nlet me tell you where you can find\nthe kernel, here's where the kernel is.\n\n506\n00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:35.450\nAnd then it points it over to that, and\nthat's enough for the booter to get in and\n\n507\n00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.140\ndo its job.\n\n508\n00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.140\nIt can say, thank you for\nsharing that with me.\n\n509\n00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.140\n&gt;&gt; That's a handy file.\n\n510\n00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:39.960\n&gt;&gt; It certainly is.\n\n511\n00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.350\n&gt;&gt; So don't delete that.\n\n512\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:42.360\n&gt;&gt; If you delete\n\n513\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.000\nthat-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n514\n00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.180\n&gt;&gt; Then you'll get operating system not\n\n515\n00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.340\nfound, that one file is enough to\nderail the whole boot process,\n\n516\n00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.430\nso pretty important file to have.\n&gt;&gt; Find, I don't know,\n\n517\n00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.530\nwrite a virus right now [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not a hard one to target.\n\n518\n00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:56.160\n&gt;&gt; I guess not.\n\n519\n00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.460\n&gt;&gt; It is a protected folder so\n\n520\n00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.490\nyou would have to have administrative\nprivileges to remove that file.\n\n521\n00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:05.330\nAnd Mac OS has something called\nsystem integrity protection that\n\n522\n00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.200\nstops you from modifying these files.\n\n523\n00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.940\nCuz malware could inject\nitself in that boot.efi file,\n\n524\n00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.550\nit'd be loaded before the OS was loaded.\n\n525\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:15.480\nThe OS wouldn't even be able to see it,\nthat's a great way to hide malware.\n\n526\n00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.310\nSo a lot of this stuff is protected\nif it's checksum changes,\n\n527\n00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.730\nif it's modified in any way,\nit's a red flag and the system won't boot.\n\n528\n00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.040\nFortunately, it's easy to replace this,\nright?\n\n529\n00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.170\nIf something is damaged here, if\nthe booter can't find my operating system,\n\n530\n00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:33.970\ntypically, it's either gonna mean\nI've got a failed hard drive, right?\n\n531\n00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.030\nPeople don't accidentally\ndelete their operating systems.\n\n532\n00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.635\nThat just doesn't happen.\n&gt;&gt; It's very rare.\n\n533\n00:25:37.635 --> 00:25:39.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I guess you could, right?\n\n534\n00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:44.392\nSo if I browse into my hard drive, and\nI start taking a look at the content.\n\n535\n00:25:44.392 --> 00:25:47.240\nThere is the system folder,\nit's got an X on it, right?\n\n536\n00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.000\nThat's where the operating system is.\n\n537\n00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.600\nAnd that EFI file was in\n/System/Library/CoreServices.\n\n538\n00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:58.010\nSo couldn't I do a two-finger click and\nchoose Move to Trash?\n\n539\n00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:58.700\nWell, no.\n\n540\n00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.630\nI can't,\nthere's nothing here in my list, right?\n\n541\n00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:02.772\nSo it's not gonna-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] option you get delete?\n\n542\n00:26:02.772 --> 00:26:04.940\n&gt;&gt; I don't know\n\n543\n00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.050\n&gt;&gt; I think if you hold down option,\n\n544\n00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:09.380\nit will give you the delete option.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n545\n00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.570\nWe'll find out though.\n\n546\n00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.540\nIt doesn't cost us any\nmoney to hold down option.\n\n547\n00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.690\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n548\n00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:15.400\n&gt;&gt; So I could get creative and\n\n549\n00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.430\ntry to drag and drop it, right?\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n550\n00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.670\n&gt;&gt; Which if I just take that and\n\n551\n00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.870\ncome down here and find my trash.\n\n552\n00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.030\nRight.\nSo here I get that big warning.\n\n553\n00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.010\nThis is system integrity protection,\nright.\n\n554\n00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:31.240\nSystem can't be modified you deleted\nbecause it's required by Mac OS.\n\n555\n00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.676\nSo if it's telling us it's missing\nsomething bad, [CROSSTALK]\n\n556\n00:26:34.676 --> 00:26:36.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something real bad has gone down.\n\n557\n00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:38.050\n&gt;&gt; And it usually is a failed hard drive.\n\n558\n00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.650\nI'd say nine times out of ten,\nit's a failed hard drive.\n\n559\n00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:43.360\nBut it could just be that\nthe operating system got corrupted or\n\n560\n00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.510\nit could be a recoverable error.\n\n561\n00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:48.920\nMaybe something was happening that\nmade that hard drive vibrate for\n\n562\n00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.730\na moment and so it did a bad read.\n\n563\n00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.690\nBut now it's not vibrating anymore and\nso now it's fine.\n\n564\n00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.040\nSo in those cases,\nI usually take two approaches on this.\n\n565\n00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.648\nFirst, I boot into recovery.\n\n566\n00:27:00.648 --> 00:27:04.800\nAnd inside of recovery, you can use\nthe Disk Utility to run First Aid.\n\n567\n00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.150\nWe've seen that in a few episodes now, so\nI won't bore us with a repeat of that.\n\n568\n00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:12.020\nBut you fire up the Disk Utility,\nclick the First Aid button, and\n\n569\n00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.370\nit'll check the drive for errors,\nand it'll fix permissions.\n\n570\n00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.690\nMaybe it's a permissions problem and\nit just can't find that file, right?\n\n571\n00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.623\nOr you might go into Disk Utility and\nthe drive doesn't even show up.\n\n572\n00:27:20.623 --> 00:27:22.683\nThere's your [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; Answer, yeah.\n\n573\n00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:24.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You really know that has gone bad.\n\n574\n00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.300\nSo that could be it.\n\n575\n00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:31.365\nBut if the hard drive repair is fine,\nand it shows up, and it's detected.\n\n576\n00:27:31.365 --> 00:27:35.140\nBut it's still not booting, it's not\nable to find that operating system,\n\n577\n00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.460\nthe best thing you do is to boot\nyour recovery and reinstall the OS.\n\n578\n00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:43.220\nRemember that when you reinstall Mac OS,\nit's a non-destructive install by default.\n\n579\n00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.570\nAnd it replaces all of\nthe protected system files.\n\n580\n00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:49.170\nSo a boot.efi is missing, it puts it back.\n\n581\n00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:52.020\nIf any other system files are missing,\nit puts them back too.\n\n582\n00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.530\nIt puts them all back so\n\n583\n00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:57.690\nthat at least the core operating system is\ngoing to function, work, and do its job.\n\n584\n00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:01.640\nAnd that's the easiest way to fix that\none, as far as the booter's concerned.\n\n585\n00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.070\nThere's no configuration options for\nthe booter.\n\n586\n00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:08.180\nIt boots up and it looks for the operating\nsystems, it goes to find them.\n\n587\n00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.680\nAnd if it can't find them,\nthat's it, you're out of luck.\n\n588\n00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.770\nIt doesn't say, hey,\ndo you wanna type in a path?\n\n589\n00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.240\nYou don't get that option.\n\n590\n00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.620\nSo it's just gonna find it,\nnothing really to tweak there.\n\n591\n00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.490\nSo pretty easy one to troubleshoot.\n\n592\n00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.950\nBut the main thing on it is that\nwe just need to make sure that\n\n593\n00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:26.570\nit's able to find those system\nfiles it needs to get us up and\n\n594\n00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:27.140\nrunning.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n595\n00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.370\nWell, Don, I hate to cut you short.\n\n596\n00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:29.830\nOur clock has run out of time.\n\n597\n00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.690\nIt's screaming for mercy over there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n598\n00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.040\n&gt;&gt; I know we've gotta get into the other\n\n599\n00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.130\nthree phases we haven't\neven touched on yet.\n\n600\n00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.040\nAny tips, tricks or\nafterthoughts before we close this show\n\n601\n00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.680\nthough?\n&gt;&gt; You know if we boil this whole show\n\n602\n00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.230\ndown, we really talked about\nthose first two phases which\n\n603\n00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.080\nare mostly hidden from us, right?\n\n604\n00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.850\nWe see black screens when\nthe stuff is going on, so\n\n605\n00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:52.400\nthe troubleshooting tools that we used, if\nwe wanted to really summarize this down,\n\n606\n00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.960\nis the hardware diagnostic but holding D.\n\n607\n00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.730\nAnd then there's booting to recovery and\nusing disk utility to run disk checks and\n\n608\n00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:01.380\nreplacing hard drives as necessary.\n\n609\n00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.540\nBut I also did mention restoring\nfrom Time Machine is another option,\n\n610\n00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.450\ninstead of reinstalling Mac OS\nyou could do a restore.\n\n611\n00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:08.623\nThat would replace all\nof your files as well,\n\n612\n00:29:08.623 --> 00:29:11.455\nreinstalling Mac OS just\nreplaces the system files.\n\n613\n00:29:11.455 --> 00:29:15.955\nSo either approach works but\nall of them leave your data intact so\n\n614\n00:29:15.955 --> 00:29:18.055\nthat's usually a good thing.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Don,\n\n615\n00:29:18.055 --> 00:29:18.700\nthanks for dropping by.\n\n616\n00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.775\nLooking forward to seeing you in the part\ntwo of this here little series

All right,\n\n4\n00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:16.420\ngreetings everyone and welcome back\nto another episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.640\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\ntoday's episode, we're continuing on,\n\n6\n00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.980\nwith our ACSP series.\n\n7\n00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.550\nSpecifically, today we're looking at\npart 2 on system troubleshooting.\n\n8\n00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.960\nJoining us back in the studio yet\n\n9\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.990\nagain the man the myth the legend,\nyou know him as Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.220\nDon, good to have you in again,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.300\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be back, and\n\n12\n00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.750\nwe're gonna continue our three\nhour of the Mac OS boot process,\n\n13\n00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.610\nWe've been talking about how we can\ntroubleshoot our system when it fires up.\n\n14\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.920\nAnd maybe it doesn't quite get into\nthe operating system like we expect.\n\n15\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.980\nThere's a lot of things that can go wrong,\nso\n\n16\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.820\nwe're just kinda looking at all of them\nand seeing what tools are available.And\n\n17\n00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.380\nwhat's the right tool to match the right\nsymptom when we find a Mac that just won't\n\n18\n00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.020\nboot up and won't get us in.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, in the previous episode,\n\n19\n00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.900\nyou mentioned the five phases that we\ngo through when we start up our system.\n\n20\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.440\nI think it would be a good idea for\n\n21\n00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.510\nyou to remind us what those phases are.\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like the phases of grief,\n\n22\n00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.168\nright?\n\n23\n00:01:10.168 --> 00:01:11.801\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Denial.\n\n24\n00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:15.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My Mac won't move what?\n\n25\n00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.842\nMy data's gone.\n\n26\n00:01:17.842 --> 00:01:19.010\nThe five phases though.\n\n27\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.030\nThey're pretty straight forward, right?\n\n28\n00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.770\nWe've got the firmware which is\nwhat's built into the motherboard.\n\n29\n00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.560\nYou press the power button.\n\n30\n00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.680\nIt does something.\n\n31\n00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.120\nThen we go to the booter, and the booter's\njob is to find the operating system.\n\n32\n00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.510\nAnd we were pretty exhaustive in the last\nepisode, looking at those two phases, and\n\n33\n00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.400\nwhat happens from there.\n\n34\n00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.860\nThe next phase, though,\nthat we didn't get to, is the kernel.\n\n35\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.860\nThe booter finds the operating system,\nand it runs the kernel.\n\n36\n00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.630\nWhat actually starts that operating\nsystem up, it's the very first thing.\n\n37\n00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.110\nSo it's really,\nreally important From there,\n\n38\n00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.060\nthe kernel fires up\na service called launch D.\n\n39\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.390\nAnd launch D fires up all the other\nservices that make up Mac OS.\n\n40\n00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.990\nAnd once that's done,\nit then turns over to the log in window.\n\n41\n00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.630\nAnd that's where we, as the end user,\ncan log into the Mac and begin to use it.\n\n42\n00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.690\nAll five of those phases have to\ncomplete successfully in order for\n\n43\n00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.800\nus to get into our Mac and\nstart to use it.\n\n44\n00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.760\nIf something goes wrong, it will have\nhappened in one of those phases.\n\n45\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.630\nAnd we can use various tools to\nbe able to look in and try and\n\n46\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.850\nfind where that failure is.\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, like you said,\n\n47\n00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.240\nwe had left off on the third phase.\n\n48\n00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.850\nMy favorite Fix, right.\n\n49\n00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.070\nWhich was the kernel if I'm not mistaken.\n\n50\n00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.170\nSo let's go ahead and jump back in and\n\n51\n00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.040\ntell us about the kernel.\n&gt;&gt; All right, now the kernel\n\n52\n00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.200\nI said in the last episode that it was the\nheart and soul of your operating system.\n\n53\n00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.150\nWell what do I mean by that?\n\n54\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.830\nYour operating system,\ndeep deep down, is one program.\n\n55\n00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.050\nThere's one program that starts it all,\nright?\n\n56\n00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.869\nBut that program is super\nanti-user friendly.\n\n57\n00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:45.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n58\n00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.060\n&gt;&gt; That program is not expecting to talk\n\n59\n00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.730\nto people.\n\n60\n00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.940\nIt's expecting to talk to other programs.\n\n61\n00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.020\nIt is the gateway in between software and\nhardware.\n\n62\n00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.060\nIt's what's facilitating who gets\nto the CPU, who gets to the memory,\n\n63\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.770\nwho gets to the network card.\n\n64\n00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.310\nAnd if you don't pass through the kernel,\nit gets angry.\n\n65\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.480\nAnd there's only specialized things,\nlike sometimes video graphics rendering,\n\n66\n00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.320\ncan go to a discrete graphics card and\nbypass the system.\n\n67\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.140\nBut even that it's still touched\nat least lightly by the kernel.\n\n68\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.720\nThe kernel is involved in everything.\n\n69\n00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.290\nNow, I said that it's the heart\nof the operating system,\n\n70\n00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.890\nit isn't the operating system.\n\n71\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.180\nAn operating system is\na user interface and\n\n72\n00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.190\na collection of tools\ncombined with a kernel.\n\n73\n00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.570\nSo in the Linux world we talk about the\nLinux kernel, well nobody installs Linux.\n\n74\n00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.440\nThey install Ubuntu or Debian or\nRedhat and it runs the Linux kernel.\n\n75\n00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.790\nWell, in Mac Os, we install Mac Os,\nthat's the operating system.\n\n76\n00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.850\nThe kernel is actually called Darwin,\nkernel's a different name.\n\n77\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.410\nI know I've said earlier that\nwhile we have this nice GUI and\n\n78\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.540\neverything's all user friendly,\nit's Mac OS.\n\n79\n00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.260\nUnder the hood,\nwe're actually running BSD Unix.\n\n80\n00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.620\nWell it's the kernel that's\nrunning BSD Unix and\n\n81\n00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.710\nwe can interface with that\nthrough our terminal.\n\n82\n00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.940\nBut everything else we're doing\nthrough this GUI which is Mac OS.\n\n83\n00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.110\nSo we don't really have to deal with\nthat Unix side of things, right?\n\n84\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.580\nIn fact, it's largely invisible to us.\n\n85\n00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.278\nFor example, let me show you.\n\n86\n00:04:13.278 --> 00:04:18.697\nIf I go into my GUI here and\nI pull up my about this Mac window.\n\n87\n00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:19.700\nWhich is gonna be a little tiny here.\n\n88\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.983\nLet me zoom in on that.\n\n89\n00:04:21.983 --> 00:04:27.962\nWhen we look at about this Mac, it tells\nme, I'm running macOS High Sierra 10.13.3.\n\n90\n00:04:27.962 --> 00:04:31.470\nDoesn't say, hey, you're running BSD Unix.\n&gt;&gt; It does not, I've noticed that.\n\n91\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.560\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't say Darwin,\n\n92\n00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.640\ndoesn't say any of that.\n\n93\n00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.410\nIf you fish around on the system report,\n\n94\n00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.870\nyou can start to find if this\ninformation is in there.\n\n95\n00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.090\nBut I am running there is this\nkernel that's running, and\n\n96\n00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.750\nit's in the background.\n\n97\n00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.590\nAnd there's little glimpses\nof it every here and\n\n98\n00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.580\nthere if you poke around\nin the right tools.\n\n99\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.063\nSo, for example, if I go into my\nactivity monitor, I fire that up.\n\n100\n00:04:54.063 --> 00:04:58.375\nAnd by default the activity\nmonitor if you look at its\n\n101\n00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:03.183\nsettings it defaults to showing\nyou just your processes.\n\n102\n00:05:03.183 --> 00:05:04.970\nSo I'm only gonna see\nprograms that are run by me.\n\n103\n00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.340\nBut if I change that to All Processes,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.440\nI wanna see everything.\n\n105\n00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.390\nNow, when I look in here,\nif I sort by process ID number.\n\n106\n00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.960\nSo this is the order these\nprocesses were run in.\n\n107\n00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.150\nAnd I wanna see the very first one.\n\n108\n00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.560\nThe very first one is process ID 0.\n\n109\n00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.425\nAnd what's it called?\n\n110\n00:05:23.425 --> 00:05:26.610\nKernel_task.\n\n111\n00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.200\nThere's a kernel, right?\n\n112\n00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.220\nBut even this doesn't tell me,\n\n113\n00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.130\nis that Darwin?\n\n114\n00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.020\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n115\n00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.250\nThe booter,\nwhen it finds the operating system,\n\n116\n00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.120\nthat boot.afi file tells it\nwhere to find the kernel.\n\n117\n00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.920\nAnd in this case it's finding it and\nit's launching it.\n\n118\n00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.710\nAnd you can actually see it.\n\n119\n00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.470\nIt is a heavily protected file.\n\n120\n00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.930\nBut you can see it in a few ways.\n\n121\n00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.886\nLet me drop to a terminal here and\n\n122\n00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:56.938\nmake that big enough where\nwe can actually see it.\n\n123\n00:05:56.938 --> 00:06:04.857\nInside of the terminal if you go\ninto /system /library/kernels.\n\n124\n00:06:04.857 --> 00:06:08.210\nOops, kernels, I can type, there.\n\n125\n00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.370\nIf we go into this folder and we take\na look in there you'll find a file.\n\n126\n00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.880\nIt's just called kernel,\nnot very exciting.\n\n127\n00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.290\nIt's not even very big.\n\n128\n00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.030\nIt's 15 megs in size,\na very, very small file.\n\n129\n00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.880\nI guess that's big enough it\nwon't fit on a floppy disk.\n\n130\n00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.580\nBut basically that is the kernel,\nthat's the heart and soul of Mac OS.\n\n131\n00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.230\nThat's the first thing,\nthat's process number one.\n\n132\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.040\nThe booter starts the kernel and\nthen the kernel does everything else.\n\n133\n00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.560\nThis is, let me correct, I said process\nnumber one, that's human counting.\n\n134\n00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.148\nComputers start at zero,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true, that's true.\n\n135\n00:06:41.148 --> 00:06:42.644\n&gt;&gt; So technically it's process zero, so\n\n136\n00:06:42.644 --> 00:06:44.120\nit would be process zero.\n\n137\n00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.300\nIt's basically initializing everything.\n\n138\n00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.050\nNow, I still don't see it called Darwin.\n\n139\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.980\nIf you use the uname command,\nthat's a Unix command, right?\n\n140\n00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.860\nIt says tell me the name of\nthe kernel that Unix is running.\n\n141\n00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.460\nSo if I run uname, it actually tells\nme t I'm running the Darwin kernel.\n\n142\n00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.430\nAnd if I do a uname -a,\nthat'll show me additional information.\n\n143\n00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.414\nAnd I can see I am running\nthe Darwin Kernel version 17.4.\n\n144\n00:07:07.414 --> 00:07:08.693\nWait a minute.\n\n145\n00:07:08.693 --> 00:07:11.494\nI'm running Mac OS 10.13.3.\n\n146\n00:07:11.494 --> 00:07:16.700\nWell, the version of the kernel does\nnot match the version of Mac OS.\n\n147\n00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.570\nRemember that Mac OS is the kernel,\nplus the UI,\n\n148\n00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.940\nplus the other applications that\nare packaged, plus the other pieces.\n\n149\n00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.300\nIncluding hardware drivers.\n\n150\n00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.590\nSo there is a different\nnumbering scheme used for that.\n\n151\n00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.870\nAnd this part here this Darwin kernel\nis what is actually based on ESD Unix.\n\n152\n00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.420\nThat's what's kicking things\noff at the very beginning and\n\n153\n00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.380\ngetting things up and going.\n\n154\n00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.180\nSo that kernel has a really important job.\n\n155\n00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.480\nIf this file those missing\nI'm gonna have a problem.\n\n156\n00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.270\n&gt;&gt; Again, we're back to virus writing.\n\n157\n00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.125\nAnd delete that kernel.\n\n158\n00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:50.018\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n159\n00:07:50.018 --> 00:07:53.868\nfortunatly because it's process zero,\nbecause it's the one that starts first,\n\n160\n00:07:53.868 --> 00:07:55.134\nthe file's always in use.\n\n161\n00:07:55.134 --> 00:07:57.670\nSo even if a virus tried ot modify it,\nit can't.\n\n162\n00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.814\nThe file's always locked.\n\n163\n00:07:58.814 --> 00:08:02.760\nEven if it did modify it, it's protected\nwith system integrity protection,\n\n164\n00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.160\nso macOS would know that.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n165\n00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.497\npretty safe there?\n&gt;&gt; Pretty safe,\n\n166\n00:08:05.497 --> 00:08:06.206\nit would be hard to-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n167\n00:08:06.206 --> 00:08:08.987\nit would take some sort of\ncorruption disk kind of thing for\n\n168\n00:08:08.987 --> 00:08:11.570\nthis to really have a problem?\n&gt;&gt; Typically, yes.\n\n169\n00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.560\nThere are some root kits that\ncould possibly mess with this but\n\n170\n00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.550\nApple's been really good\nabout stomping those out.\n\n171\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.870\nSo, it's usually gonna\nbe hardware failure or\n\n172\n00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:26.910\nsome kind of software corruption,\nwhich typically is caused by bad RAM.\n\n173\n00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.280\nSo again, it goes back to hardware.\n\n174\n00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.587\nSo you've got your hardware\ndiagnostics that you can launch,\n\n175\n00:08:31.587 --> 00:08:33.600\nthat you can go in and try and\ntroubleshoot with those.\n\n176\n00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.532\nThere are some things though,\nthat can mess will the kernel.\n\n177\n00:08:38.532 --> 00:08:43.280\nWhere it's not actually the kernel's\nfault that something is wrong, right?\n\n178\n00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.092\nThe kernel itself is probably only one and\na half megs in size.\n\n179\n00:08:48.092 --> 00:08:50.510\nBut I can see the file here is 15 megs,\nright?\n\n180\n00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.200\nThe rest of that file is made up of\n\n181\n00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.940\nmodules that let it\ncontrol certain hardware.\n\n182\n00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.190\nApple knows what hardware is\ngoing to be in their Macs, and so\n\n183\n00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.460\nthey can bake support for\nthat right into the kernel.\n\n184\n00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.520\nIt makes the kernel bigger,\nin the Linux world they don't like that,\n\n185\n00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.701\nthey like to keep it small because\nthere's too much hardware out there.\n\n186\n00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:12.380\nThey'd have a 500 meg kernel if they\nput all the hardware drivers in there.\n\n187\n00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.390\nApple knows their hardware.\n\n188\n00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:14.990\nSo they can do it.\n\n189\n00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.510\nIt's only 15 megs.\n&gt;&gt; So they keep it\n\n190\n00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.820\nvery streamlined because of that.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\n\n191\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.720\nmore stable.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n192\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.588\n&gt;&gt; Right, because anything the kernel\n\n193\n00:09:21.588 --> 00:09:25.590\ntouches, if it's unstable,\nthen the kernel becomes unstable.\n\n194\n00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.460\nWell, hey third party hardware,\nwe're gonna have it.\n\n195\n00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.770\nJust through the course of using our\ncomputers you're going to buy microphones,\n\n196\n00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:38.120\nor external hard drives, printers,\nthings that need hardware drivers.\n\n197\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.030\nAnd the kernel needs to know\nhow to talk to that hardware.\n\n198\n00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.390\nAnd so they're gonna use what\nare called kernel extensions.\n\n199\n00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.750\nKernel extensions can actually be in a few\ndifferent places but the main place is\n\n200\n00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:54.630\ngonna be in /System/Library/Extensions/.\n\n201\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.630\nThis place is going to contain\nkernel extensions that\n\n202\n00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.230\nApple themselves have approved and\nprovided.\n\n203\n00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:07.430\nAnd when I look in there, I'll see a bunch\nof files, and these are from Apple.\n\n204\n00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.788\nAnd all of these files ends in .kext,\nyou'll hear people call them kexts,\n\n205\n00:10:11.788 --> 00:10:14.173\nwhich I hate cuz it sounds stupid.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:10:14.173 --> 00:10:16.525\n&gt;&gt; Makes you think of the bad guys in\n\n207\n00:10:16.525 --> 00:10:20.286\nthe dark crystal,\nremember those kexes [CROSSTALK]\n\n208\n00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.676\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah [LAUGH]\n\n261\n00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.340\n&gt;&gt; That's why they're so critical,\n\n262\n00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.000\nbecause their kernel extension in\nthe back end, if there's an exploit,\n\n263\n00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.520\nsomebody could immediately gain elevated\nprivilege access to your whole system.\n\n264\n00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.600\nThat's why a lot of people said boy,\n\n265\n00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.440\nApple is being real jerks\nabout not supporting Flash.\n\n266\n00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.080\nWell, there's a reason because Flash\nis just a total bypass of security.\n\n267\n00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.202\nIt's a problem.\n\n268\n00:13:28.202 --> 00:13:32.250\nSo that's what we need\nto be aware of here.\n\n269\n00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:37.290\nWhat I find is that if you have a kernel\nproblem it's usually either bad RAM or\n\n270\n00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.220\na bad hard drive,\n\n271\n00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:43.840\nwhich we talked about in the last episode,\nor a bad kernel extension.\n\n272\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.120\nAnd bad kernel extensions can\ncause this pretty easily.\n\n273\n00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.870\nSo to troubleshoot that,\nyou've got a few options, right?\n\n274\n00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:55.900\nOption one, if you know,\nlike I just installed this driver, and\n\n275\n00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.362\nI know that's my problem,\nyou can boot your recovery.\n\n276\n00:13:59.362 --> 00:14:03.846\nAnd in recovery, you can go into\nthe terminal, you can browse right\n\n277\n00:14:03.846 --> 00:14:08.910\nto this folder, and you can delete or\nmove off the kernel extension.\n\n278\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.830\nAnd then when you reboot, it won't load.\n\n279\n00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.720\nRight, so you can do that.\n\n280\n00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.090\nBut let's say I don't know.\n\n281\n00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:19.648\nI think I've installed some stuff sure,\nbut I don't know if that's the problem,\n\n282\n00:14:19.648 --> 00:14:21.156\nI just wanna test, right?\n\n283\n00:14:21.156 --> 00:14:24.640\nIf you wanna test on a Mac you\ncan do what's called safe boot.\n\n284\n00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:32.530\nSafe boot says boot Mac OS and only load\nthe kernel extensions that Apple provided.\n\n285\n00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.030\nDon't load any any third party ones.\n\n286\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.430\nIt's a quick way to test, your third\nparty hardware is not going to work.\n\n287\n00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're just eliminating them as\n\n288\n00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:39.390\nthe problem.\n\n289\n00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.190\nSo if you loaded into\nthe safe mode business and\n\n290\n00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.180\nthings are still broken you know it's not\nwith the stuff, your third party stuff.\n\n291\n00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.350\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and it's easy enough to do.\n\n292\n00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.678\nIf we want to boot in safe mode\nall we have to do is shut down.\n\n293\n00:14:50.678 --> 00:14:53.940\nThis is another keyboard key\nthat we hold down when we boot.\n\n294\n00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.980\nSo I'm gonna shut the system down.\n\n295\n00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:01.700\nAnd when we boot up all you have to do is\nhold down the shift key on your keyboard.\n\n296\n00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.780\nAll right, and so\nI'm gonna wait that light to go off.\n\n297\n00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.580\nAnd I'm gonna hold shift, and so\nnow I'm holding shift on my keyboard and\n\n298\n00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.770\nI'm pressing that power button,\nand its gonna boot up now.\n\n299\n00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.010\nEverything is going to look\nlike normal up unto a point,\n\n300\n00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.720\nyou'll notice when its different.\n\n301\n00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.419\nThat's probably the dumbest thing\nI'm gonna say today, isn't it?\n\n302\n00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:21.491\nEverything is going to look\nnormal until it looks different.\n\n303\n00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:24.126\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] well said,\n\n304\n00:15:24.126 --> 00:15:26.010\nDan, well said.\n\n305\n00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:30.400\nCaptain obvious over here.\n&gt;&gt; So anyhow it is gonna boot.\n\n306\n00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.460\nIt's gonna boot slower, right?\n\n307\n00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.420\nDid the light light up?\n\n308\n00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.770\nI might not have pushed the button.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's on.\n\n309\n00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:37.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n310\n00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.740\nit's gonna boot slower because it\nhas to flush the kernel cache.\n\n311\n00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.661\nThe kernel caches these extensions so\nthey can boot faster and\n\n312\n00:15:43.661 --> 00:15:45.220\nit has to flush all that.\n\n313\n00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.880\nSo that makes it take\na little longer to boot.\n\n314\n00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.280\nNormally I would have already\nseen my apple logo appear,\n\n315\n00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.420\nthe little bar would be\ngoing across the screen.\n\n316\n00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.776\nThat's not happening yet, so\nI just gotta wait patiently.\n\n317\n00:15:54.776 --> 00:15:56.003\n&gt;&gt; Well Dante, just hold on.\n\n318\n00:15:56.003 --> 00:15:57.576\nGive your little Mac a chance.\n\n319\n00:15:57.576 --> 00:15:58.988\nYou don't wanna pressure the thing.\n\n320\n00:15:58.988 --> 00:16:01.058\nIt's on TV, it's getting a little gun shy.\n\n321\n00:16:01.058 --> 00:16:03.414\nJust give it a second.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah unfortunately, Daniel,\n\n322\n00:16:03.414 --> 00:16:05.828\npatience is the bane of my existence.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n323\n00:16:05.828 --> 00:16:06.904\n&gt;&gt; But like any good IT guy,\n\n324\n00:16:06.904 --> 00:16:09.731\nI spend most of my time watching\nlittle bars appear on the screen.\n\n325\n00:16:09.731 --> 00:16:11.136\nThere we go, it just came up.\n\n326\n00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:13.380\nAll right, so I get my Apple and again,\n\n327\n00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.650\nit looks like it's booting\nnormally until it doesn't.\n\n328\n00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.345\nIt's gonna move through this process.\n\n329\n00:16:18.345 --> 00:16:19.634\nIt's doing the normal stuff.\n\n330\n00:16:19.634 --> 00:16:23.013\nIt is loading the kernel\nextensions that Apple provided.\n\n331\n00:16:23.013 --> 00:16:25.729\nIt's rebuilding that cache,\nand getting that put in place.\n\n332\n00:16:25.729 --> 00:16:28.435\nAnd then as soon as it's done,\nit's gonna take me to a login screen.\n\n333\n00:16:28.435 --> 00:16:32.741\nEverything's gonna look like the normal\nprocess except, there'll be a little\n\n334\n00:16:32.741 --> 00:16:37.315\nnote at the top right of my screen, it'll\nbe written in red, it'll say, Safe Boot.\n\n335\n00:16:37.315 --> 00:16:41.275\nThat's the visual indicator that\nlets me know we just booted with\n\n336\n00:16:41.275 --> 00:16:44.014\nonly the Apple approved kernel extensions.\n\n337\n00:16:44.014 --> 00:16:45.725\nAnd now I can go in and test.\n\n338\n00:16:45.725 --> 00:16:47.810\nDo I still have the problem\nthat I had before?\n\n339\n00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.328\nIf I do, I know it's not my\nthird party kernel extensions.\n\n340\n00:16:51.328 --> 00:16:54.182\nAnd I didn't have to worry about deleting\nthem, removing them or anything like that.\n\n341\n00:16:54.182 --> 00:16:56.748\nI can just reboot and\nnow they're loading again.\n\n342\n00:16:56.748 --> 00:16:58.657\nBut if the problem is now gone,\n\n343\n00:16:58.657 --> 00:17:03.218\nI immediately know, it's one of\nmy third party kernel extensions.\n\n344\n00:17:03.218 --> 00:17:06.040\nAnd at that point you can just\neither delete them one by one, or\n\n345\n00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.939\nwhat I normally do is delete them all, and\n\n346\n00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:10.498\nre-install them one by one.\n&gt;&gt; Just come down with the ban\n\n347\n00:17:10.498 --> 00:17:11.313\nhammer, right?\n\n348\n00:17:11.313 --> 00:17:13.349\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Basically it.\n\n349\n00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:17.338\nAnd let me zoom in so you can see that\nlittle, no, way up there in the corner.\n\n350\n00:17:17.338 --> 00:17:22.045\nSee right up there by my WiFi signal,\nit says Safe Boot?\n\n351\n00:17:22.045 --> 00:17:24.366\nThat's really the only\nindicator that I get.\n\n352\n00:17:24.366 --> 00:17:27.410\nThat and the fact that anything that\ndepended on a third-party kernel\n\n353\n00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:28.608\nextension doesn't work.\n\n354\n00:17:28.608 --> 00:17:30.988\n[LAUGH] There's that piece.\n\n355\n00:17:30.988 --> 00:17:34.796\nSo now I'm in safe boot,\nI can log in like normal and\n\n356\n00:17:34.796 --> 00:17:39.766\njust punch in my account password and\nit's gonna go in and fire up.\n\n357\n00:17:39.766 --> 00:17:42.255\nThings like auto-start programs and stuff,\n\n358\n00:17:42.255 --> 00:17:46.350\nthose are gonna load just like normal\ncuz those aren't kernel extensions.\n\n359\n00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:50.407\nBut if had hardware that was\ndependent on an extension like that,\n\n360\n00:17:50.407 --> 00:17:52.856\nit's going to be broken at this point.\n\n361\n00:17:52.856 --> 00:17:54.632\nI don't have my Logitech\nkeyboard hooked up.\n\n362\n00:17:54.632 --> 00:17:58.779\nBut actually, normally, when you have the\nLogitech software, if you go into system\n\n363\n00:17:58.779 --> 00:18:02.995\npreferences, there's a little control\npanel here, this Logitech control center.\n\n364\n00:18:02.995 --> 00:18:06.538\nAnd if I were to fire that up, regardless\nof whether I had a Logitech device\n\n365\n00:18:06.538 --> 00:18:08.950\nattached or not, it would say,\nno device found.\n\n366\n00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:13.145\nIt won't be able to see the device because\nthat kernel extension is not loaded.\n\n367\n00:18:13.145 --> 00:18:15.331\nSo that's just a quick\nway to troubleshoot that.\n\n368\n00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:19.205\nAnd it's pretty much the extent of what\nwe can do with kernel troubleshooting.\n\n369\n00:18:19.205 --> 00:18:23.672\nSo disable third party kernel extensions\nby using safe boot or restore with time\n\n370\n00:18:23.672 --> 00:18:28.085\nmachine or you can always reinstall Mac OS\nif you think it's a corrupt kernel.\n\n371\n00:18:28.085 --> 00:18:29.188\nOdds are it's not.\n\n372\n00:18:29.188 --> 00:18:31.383\nBut that's basically what\nhappens with phase three.\n\n373\n00:18:31.383 --> 00:18:32.086\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n374\n00:18:32.086 --> 00:18:36.022\nwell that moves us into phase four,\nwhich is the good old launchd,\n\n375\n00:18:36.022 --> 00:18:38.850\nwhich is an interesting\npiece of terminology.\n\n376\n00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.322\nObviously coming from\nthe Unix side of things.\n\n377\n00:18:41.322 --> 00:18:44.144\nBut Don, could you tell us\na little more about that phase?\n\n378\n00:18:44.144 --> 00:18:45.664\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\n\n379\n00:18:45.664 --> 00:18:49.090\nonce we get through the kernel launching.\n\n380\n00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:53.682\nWe launch our kernel and, actually,\nI'm trying to use my Spotlight and\n\n381\n00:18:53.682 --> 00:18:56.931\nthe Spotlight kernel extension is not,\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n382\n00:18:56.931 --> 00:18:57.836\n&gt;&gt; Loaded.\n\n383\n00:18:57.836 --> 00:18:58.552\n&gt;&gt; It's loaded but\n\n384\n00:18:58.552 --> 00:19:01.569\nit's had its cache wiped, so\nit's not finding my activity monitor,\n\n385\n00:19:01.569 --> 00:19:02.297\na bit annoying.\n\n386\n00:19:02.297 --> 00:19:09.590\nBut once the kernel fires up, it needs\nto launch all these other programs.\n\n387\n00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:13.782\nAll of these other things that run in\nthe background that make macOS work.\n\n388\n00:19:13.782 --> 00:19:17.326\nLike the network protocol stack so\nthat TCIP can work.\n\n389\n00:19:17.326 --> 00:19:19.508\nOr the WiFi connection.\n\n390\n00:19:19.508 --> 00:19:22.190\nIt's called the WiFi supplicant\nthat lets you do authentication.\n\n391\n00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.152\nAll those other things.\n\n392\n00:19:24.152 --> 00:19:26.358\nSo where are they?\n\n393\n00:19:26.358 --> 00:19:27.380\nWhat happens with them?\n\n394\n00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.234\nWell the kernel fires up\nanother task called launchd.\n\n395\n00:19:31.234 --> 00:19:35.774\nAnd it's launchd's responsibility to go\nin and figure out everything to fire up.\n\n396\n00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:38.769\nNow launchd is very similar\nto a kernel itself.\n\n397\n00:19:38.769 --> 00:19:46.536\nIn fact, it is task number two.\n\n398\n00:19:46.536 --> 00:19:48.055\nIt's search memory is zero, so\n\n399\n00:19:48.055 --> 00:19:50.937\nit's process ID number one is\nthe actual process ID number.\n\n400\n00:19:50.937 --> 00:19:53.028\nIf I go into my activity monitor,\n\n401\n00:19:53.028 --> 00:19:56.103\nwhich I promise I can get\nto here in just a moment.\n\n402\n00:19:56.103 --> 00:19:58.680\nYou don't realize how much you depend\non Spotlight until it's not there.\n\n403\n00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.342\n&gt;&gt; Until it's gone.\n\n404\n00:19:59.342 --> 00:20:01.022\n&gt;&gt; You just constantly use it.\n\n405\n00:20:01.022 --> 00:20:02.127\n&gt;&gt; I feel like a Cinderella song is\n\n406\n00:20:02.127 --> 00:20:02.941\ngonna start playing.\n\n407\n00:20:02.941 --> 00:20:05.112\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

What do they call it, a honey do list?\n\n421\n00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.439\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a honey do list [CROSSTALK].\n\n422\n00:20:43.439 --> 00:20:44.101\n&gt;&gt; Check that out.\n\n423\n00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:47.259\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it has a honey do list, right?\n\n424\n00:20:47.259 --> 00:20:51.403\nAnd that tells it all the things that it\nneeds to fire up and get up and running.\n\n425\n00:20:51.403 --> 00:20:54.352\nAnd you can see those\nthings right after it.\n\n426\n00:20:54.352 --> 00:20:58.636\nThe system log, so we can record when\nerrors happen, we get a log event for it.\n\n427\n00:20:58.636 --> 00:21:02.892\nThe kernel extension daemon,\nthe uninstall daemon, the event daemon,\n\n428\n00:21:02.892 --> 00:21:04.957\nall these other different things.\n\n429\n00:21:04.957 --> 00:21:09.348\nThese are all running in the background,\npower management,\n\n430\n00:21:09.348 --> 00:21:12.312\nall of these are really important stuff.\n\n431\n00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:14.761\nFUD, what is that one?\n&gt;&gt; FUD [LAUGH].\n\n432\n00:21:14.761 --> 00:21:16.960\n&gt;&gt; Fear, uncertainty and doubt or\n\n433\n00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.430\nis it the FUD daemon?\n\n434\n00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.450\nI don't know that one.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna stop there, I think.\n\n435\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.334\n&gt;&gt; I'll have to look that one up,\n\n436\n00:21:21.334 --> 00:21:22.144\nI'm not sure what it is.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n437\n00:21:22.144 --> 00:21:24.386\nwhen my computer stops working\nwith it its the FUD method.\n\n438\n00:21:24.386 --> 00:21:25.373\n&gt;&gt; It might be.\n\n439\n00:21:25.373 --> 00:21:26.708\nIt may well be.\n\n440\n00:21:26.708 --> 00:21:29.344\nSo all of this stuff though,\nlaunchd is firing up.\n\n441\n00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:34.098\nAnd we use these things all throughout the\nday, this is how we interact with systems,\n\n442\n00:21:34.098 --> 00:21:35.891\nso really, really important.\n\n443\n00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:38.505\nLaunchd can have problems.\n\n444\n00:21:38.505 --> 00:21:41.924\nIt can have problems where it's trying to\nload some other daemon that's damaged, or\n\n445\n00:21:41.924 --> 00:21:44.645\nthere's third party software\nthat's trying to load this damage.\n\n446\n00:21:44.645 --> 00:21:47.455\nAnd now it starts to have a failure.\n\n447\n00:21:47.455 --> 00:21:50.992\nSo when that happens,\nwe don't even make it to a log in window.\n\n448\n00:21:50.992 --> 00:21:55.068\nYou see the apple, the little bar starts\nto crawl across, and it stops dead.\n\n449\n00:21:55.068 --> 00:21:58.008\nSame kinda thing with the kernel\nextension, it'll start crawling and\n\n450\n00:21:58.008 --> 00:22:00.855\ndie, or you'll actually get in and\nyour hardware just won't work.\n\n451\n00:22:00.855 --> 00:22:05.920\nSo very similar troubleshooting as\nfar as the kernel versus launchd.\n\n452\n00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.562\nKinda troubleshoot them the same way.\n\n453\n00:22:07.562 --> 00:22:12.201\nIn fact, if I wanna troubleshoot\nlaunchd one of the first things I do,\n\n454\n00:22:12.201 --> 00:22:13.391\nis I do safe boot.\n\n455\n00:22:13.391 --> 00:22:19.127\nBecause not only does safe boot say only\nload the Apple approved kernel extensions,\n\n456\n00:22:19.127 --> 00:22:23.106\nsafe boot also tells launchd\nto only run Apple processes.\n\n457\n00:22:23.106 --> 00:22:27.253\nAnd so it won't run any third party\ndaemons that it may be set to start.\n\n458\n00:22:27.253 --> 00:22:28.669\n&gt;&gt; It's like a troubleshooting BOGO.\n\n459\n00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:30.458\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It certainly is,\n\n460\n00:22:30.458 --> 00:22:33.394\nI'll actually show you a third\nthing it can do in a minute.\n\n461\n00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:35.809\nSo it becomes a, what is it, like a TROGO.\n&gt;&gt; A TROGO.\n\n462\n00:22:35.809 --> 00:22:38.928\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Try one, get two.\n\n463\n00:22:38.928 --> 00:22:41.231\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It breaks down now.\n\n464\n00:22:41.231 --> 00:22:42.697\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We've ruined the shopping\n\n465\n00:22:42.697 --> 00:22:44.389\nmodel.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n466\n00:22:44.389 --> 00:22:45.621\n&gt;&gt; But basically if I\n\n467\n00:22:45.621 --> 00:22:49.080\nwanna troubleshoot launchd\nI kind of already am.\n\n468\n00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.081\nI'm booted into safe boot, which is\nwhy my Spotlight isn't working for me.\n\n469\n00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:57.111\nI'm logged in with safe boot which means\nI'm only running Apple approved kernel\n\n470\n00:22:57.111 --> 00:22:57.882\nextensions and\n\n471\n00:22:57.882 --> 00:23:01.930\nApple approved demons or services that\nare running to get my system up and going.\n\n472\n00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:03.490\nTroubleshooting both at once.\n\n473\n00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.777\nNow if you want to see that to do list.\n\n474\n00:23:05.777 --> 00:23:08.092\nRemember with kernel extensions I\nshowed you guys the folder where\n\n475\n00:23:08.092 --> 00:23:08.761\nthose files were.\n\n476\n00:23:08.761 --> 00:23:15.169\nWe can do the same thing with our,\nI keep forgetting.\n\n477\n00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:19.471\nIt's doing the web Spotlight search,\nwhich is effectively useless to me.\n\n478\n00:23:19.471 --> 00:23:21.166\nSo let me get back into my terminal here.\n\n479\n00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:25.937\nAnd in the terminal we can browse in and\nactually see where these things are.\n\n480\n00:23:25.937 --> 00:23:27.725\nNow there's a few different places.\n\n481\n00:23:27.725 --> 00:23:31.463\nThe official Apple ones\nare inside of /system.\n\n482\n00:23:31.463 --> 00:23:39.729\nIf I browse into\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons.\n\n483\n00:23:39.729 --> 00:23:40.554\nThere we go.\n\n484\n00:23:40.554 --> 00:23:43.886\nAnd it's D-A-E,\nspelled like the Old English way.\n\n485\n00:23:43.886 --> 00:23:45.511\nSo if I go into [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Ye olde daemon.\n\n486\n00:23:45.511 --> 00:23:47.938\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ye olde daemon.\n\n487\n00:23:47.938 --> 00:23:51.405\nI can look here and\nyou'll see mostly everything is com.apple,\n\n488\n00:23:51.405 --> 00:23:53.430\nthose are ones that are made by Apple.\n\n489\n00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:54.794\nSome of them are from Unix though.\n\n490\n00:23:54.794 --> 00:23:58.541\nSo you'll see other ones that\nhave more generic names.\n\n491\n00:23:58.541 --> 00:24:01.340\nSome of them,\nlike this one here for cups.org,\n\n492\n00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.676\nthat's the common Unix print service.\n\n493\n00:24:03.676 --> 00:24:07.472\nSo it sounds very Unix-y, Apple is\nthe primary sponsor of that project.\n\n494\n00:24:07.472 --> 00:24:10.583\nSo it's really almost\nentirely written by Apple.\n\n495\n00:24:10.583 --> 00:24:13.498\nBut you'll see all of those\ndifferent daemons right here, and\n\n496\n00:24:13.498 --> 00:24:17.490\nthese are their preference files for\nthem, the plists, the preference list.\n\n497\n00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:21.750\nTheir binaries are stored in other\nlocations like /bin or /sbin and different\n\n498\n00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:25.885\nplaces like that, but these are all the\nconfigurations that launchd is looking at.\n\n499\n00:24:25.885 --> 00:24:28.560\nlaunchd sees this in the plist file for\neach one.\n\n500\n00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.600\nIt'll say start this at boot, or\n\n501\n00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.800\ndon't start this at boot,\nit'll actually indicate it in there.\n\n502\n00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.400\nBut these are the Apple-approved ones,\nright?\n\n503\n00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.960\nThe third-party ones, they're not\ngoing to be in /System/Library.\n\n504\n00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.510\nThey're going to just be\nin straight up /Library.\n\n505\n00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:47.150\nAnd so if I go and take a look in there,\nit should be a smaller list, and\n\n506\n00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:52.530\nyou can see, like for me,\nI'm assuming that's Adobe Flash Player.\n\n507\n00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.820\nI've got the Apple server daemon.\n\n508\n00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:59.610\nThat is by Apple, but it's an app that\nI install from the App Store, and\n\n509\n00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:03.755\nso it shows here as third-party\neven though it's Apple.\n\n510\n00:25:03.755 --> 00:25:07.260\nSplashtop Streamer is a little program\nthat I use to be able to remotely view\n\n511\n00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.150\nmy screen when I'm on\na different computer.\n\n512\n00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:12.150\nSo these are things that I installed and\n\n513\n00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:16.440\nany one of them could derail my system\nfrom being able to log in, right?\n\n514\n00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.140\nAnd so, I might wanna disable these,\nwell I did disable them.\n\n515\n00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:25.450\nWhen I booted into safe boot, my Splashtop\nand my VNC, neither one launched.\n\n516\n00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.970\nNormally, I would see up at the top,\n\n517\n00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:34.170\nup here in my little bar, I would see\nwhat looks like a splash of paint,\n\n518\n00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:39.110\nwhich is the Splashtop icon, and I would\nsee the VNC in a box, which is its icon.\n\n519\n00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:40.281\nNeither one's up here.\n\n520\n00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:42.780\nYour daemons didn't load, so\nthe software doesn't work,\n\n521\n00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.080\nthat means their menu bar\nitem doesn't show up.\n\n522\n00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.170\nSo I know those didn't boot,\neven though they normally would,\n\n523\n00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.700\nthat's what safe boot does, so\na great way to troubleshoot that.\n\n524\n00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.591\nNow, I know I'm running short on time,\nbut I wanna show one more thing.\n\n525\n00:25:55.591 --> 00:26:00.091\nThis probably won't be on the test but\nis really handy for real life,\n\n526\n00:26:00.091 --> 00:26:04.143\nthe test focuses a lot on,\nhere's a Mac running High Sierra.\n\n527\n00:26:04.143 --> 00:26:06.942\nBut there's some scenarios\nthat happen when you have\n\n528\n00:26:06.942 --> 00:26:09.640\na Mac that's been upgraded to High Sierra.\n\n529\n00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.480\nIf you have an older piece of Mac hardware\nthat's been upgraded several times,\n\n530\n00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.320\nMacs didn't always use\nthese launch statements.\n\n531\n00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.460\nIn fact, they use to use what\nwere called Startup Items, and\n\n532\n00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:24.075\nApple has told all the developers\nout there, stop using Startup Items.\n\n533\n00:26:24.075 --> 00:26:25.144\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Big bad.\n\n534\n00:26:25.144 --> 00:26:26.401\n&gt;&gt; And if you use Startup Items,\n\n535\n00:26:26.401 --> 00:26:28.860\nwe won't approve your\napp in our App Store.\n\n536\n00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.440\nBut you can still use Startup Items if\nyou're distributing your application\n\n537\n00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.360\noutside of the App Store,\nwhich most developers do.\n\n538\n00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.804\nSo if you're having a problem and\nyou boot to safe boot,\n\n539\n00:26:37.804 --> 00:26:40.000\nit's actually stopping\nthe Startup Items also.\n\n540\n00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.300\nBut they're stored in a different place,\nso I just wanna show you that again.\n\n541\n00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.623\nI don't think it will be on the exam,\nbut instead of going to\n\n542\n00:26:46.623 --> 00:26:51.910\n/Library/LaunchDaemons, you can\ngo to /Library/StartupItems.\n\n543\n00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.880\nAnd see how that folder's still there?\n\n544\n00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.020\nApple's telling us not to use it but\nit's still there, it's for\n\n545\n00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:56.970\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n546\n00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.650\nThey don't wanna break\nthe older software just yet.\n\n547\n00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:03.165\nEventually this folder will go away,\nbut as long as it exists you may wanna\n\n548\n00:27:03.165 --> 00:27:06.298\ntake a look in there and\nsee if anything's in it, mine's empty.\n\n549\n00:27:06.298 --> 00:27:09.811\nIf I look at the system version of\nthat It should be empty as well,\n\n550\n00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:12.410\nApple's moved all their stuff out of it.\n\n551\n00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:14.310\nSo it's worth a glance, though.\n\n552\n00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.400\nIf you have a Mac that's been\nupgraded from previous versions,\n\n553\n00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.160\nit may have third-party software that's\ncreated some Startup Items in there.\n\n554\n00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.650\nSo if you're trying to disable and\nif you've booted the recovery and\n\n555\n00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:24.980\nyou're trying to dig\nsomething out of there and\n\n556\n00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.890\ndelete file,\ncheck those directories as well.\n\n557\n00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.226\nThey do hang about.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don,\n\n558\n00:27:30.226 --> 00:27:33.671\nI know we didn't get to the fifth stage,\nor phase as we like to call it, but\n\n559\n00:27:33.671 --> 00:27:35.393\nI know we can just make another show,\n\n560\n00:27:35.393 --> 00:27:37.262\nso that's what we're gonna do.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n561\n00:27:37.262 --> 00:27:41.008\n[LAUGH] So thanks for dropping by,\nanything you wanna leave us with before we\n\n562\n00:27:41.008 --> 00:27:42.741\ncall this one a show?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n563\n00:27:42.741 --> 00:27:44.820\nwe do have one more phase,\nthe login window.\n\n564\n00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.410\nWe'll talk about it, it sounds boring,\nbut there's actually a good bit to it.\n\n565\n00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.880\nSo we'll get a chance to get it, and then\nthere's a handful of other troubleshooting\n\n566\n00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.810\ntools that I wanna show you guys that\naren't necessarily tied to a particular\n\n567\n00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.320\nphase, but are pretty darn handy.\n\n568\n00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.510\nSo in the next episode we'll cover phase\nfive, and I'll throw in those other tools,\n\n569\n00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:03.210\nso definitely tune in for that one.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don, thanks again for\n\n570\n00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:03.810\njoining us.\n\n571\n00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.644\nAnd thank you good folks out there for\nwatching.\n\n572\n00:28:05.644 --> 00:28:09.350\nBut as we've said it's time for us to\ncall it a day, signing off for ITProTV,\n\n573\n00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.930\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt; I'm Don Pezet.\n\n574\n00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.138\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n575\n00:28:14.138 --> 00:28:20.786\n[MUSIC]\n\n576\n00:28:20.786 --> 00:28:22.909\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Daniel Lowrie and\n\n6\n00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:21.566\nin today episode we continue on\nwith more in our ECSB series.\n\n7\n00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.482\nJoining us yet again for\na part three and system troubleshooting,\n\n8\n00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:25.960\nI know, the fun never ends.\n\n9\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.410\nOur good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.360\nDon, we're glad to have you yet\nagain, how's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.320\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back,\n\n12\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.195\nDaniel, and my chance to redeem myself-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:34.386\n&gt;&gt; Our troubleshooting\n\n14\n00:00:34.386 --> 00:00:35.443\nin the boot process.\n\n15\n00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:40.094\nIn the first couple of episodes [LAUGH]\nwe've been covering the five phases of\n\n16\n00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:43.146\nthe boot process,\nwe talked about the firmware,\n\n17\n00:00:43.146 --> 00:00:45.414\nthe booter, the kernel, launch D.\n\n18\n00:00:45.414 --> 00:00:48.606\nAnd now we're ready to talk about\nthe log in window which sounds like\n\n19\n00:00:48.606 --> 00:00:52.500\none of the more boring ones, but\nis actually pretty darned important.\n\n20\n00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.524\nSo we're gonna get a chance to see\nhow it works and what it does and\n\n21\n00:00:55.524 --> 00:00:58.829\nthen I had a few other troubleshooting\ntools that I wanna highlight and\n\n22\n00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.371\nshow because they're pretty handy and\nthey span across all of the phases.\n\n23\n00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:04.236\nSo we'll do that here in\nthis episode as well.\n\n24\n00:01:04.236 --> 00:01:05.316\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's funny, Don,\n\n25\n00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:07.575\nyou started talking about the fifth phase,\nthe login phase.\n\n26\n00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:10.417\nI'm thinking, I forgot my password and\n\n27\n00:01:10.417 --> 00:01:12.350\nthat's the only thing.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n28\n00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.652\n&gt;&gt; But I'm sure there's more to it than\n\n29\n00:01:13.652 --> 00:01:16.518\nthat, so without further ado I'll kick it\nback to you and you tell us what's up.\n\n30\n00:01:16.518 --> 00:01:17.479\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n31\n00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.443\nthe login window is pretty darn important,\n\n32\n00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:25.530\nbecause if you can't get to the login\nwindow, you can't run, right?\n\n33\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.490\nBut this one is actually\na lot easier to break,\n\n34\n00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.730\nbecause it's built around\nthe idea of permissions, right?\n\n35\n00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.300\nWhen I fire up a computer, so\nif I take a look at my Mac here,\n\n36\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.460\nI'm at the login screen and it's just\nsitting here asking me for a password.\n\n37\n00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.330\nNow technically there's two different\nlogin screens that happen in MacOS.\n\n38\n00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.560\nIf you have File Vault turned on,\nyou see a File Vault log in screen and\n\n39\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.330\nyou provide it credentials which are used\nto unlock your encrypted hard drive.\n\n40\n00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.430\nAnd by the time it gets to the regular\nlog in window, which is this one,\n\n41\n00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.040\nit's already got your credentials,\nso it passes you right through.\n\n42\n00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.650\nYou don't even see this log in window,\nbut it does run,\n\n43\n00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.530\nit is in the background, right?\n\n44\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.650\nIf you have File Vault turned off,\nyou power on, you see the Apple logo, and\n\n45\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.860\nthen you're brought to this login window\nand it does ask for a password, cuz it\n\n46\n00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.020\ndoesn't have your credentials unless you\nenabled auto-login and stored them, right?\n\n47\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.404\nSo it's just sitting here waiting.\n\n48\n00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:21.320\nWhen this login window runs,\nit's a program.\n\n49\n00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.244\nIt's a program that's\nrunning on your system.\n\n50\n00:02:23.244 --> 00:02:27.180\nAnd it's running with root privileges.\n\n51\n00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.820\nIn other words,\n\n52\n00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.410\nit's running at the highest elevated\nprivileges possible on the system.\n\n53\n00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.130\nSo this window,\nit could do a lot of damage.\n\n54\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.320\nWell, there's only so\nmuch we can do from here.\n\n55\n00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.650\nI can type in my password to log in.\n\n56\n00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.838\nIf I had more than one user,\nI could hit the back arrow and\n\n57\n00:02:42.838 --> 00:02:44.293\nchange to a different user account.\n\n58\n00:02:44.293 --> 00:02:46.702\nI can shutdown, restart,\nor go to sleep and\n\n59\n00:02:46.702 --> 00:02:51.110\nthat's pretty much the extent of\nthe damage that I can do from this screen.\n\n60\n00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.707\nSo it's pretty safe for\nthis to run as root.\n\n61\n00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:57.550\nThe reason it runs as root is that\nI'm gonna provide it credentials.\n\n62\n00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.020\nI'm gonna type in my password.\n\n63\n00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.990\nAnd when I do that, the log-in window\nis going to switch its identity.\n\n64\n00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.750\nAnd it's gonna say,\n\n65\n00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.500\nI'm not running as root anymore,\nnow I'm running as Don Pezet, right?\n\n66\n00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.470\nThe moment I press Enter,\nlog-in window changes its identity and\n\n67\n00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.170\nnow it's Don Pezet.\n\n68\n00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.750\nAnd now any program that I run\nIs gonna be run as Don Pezet.\n\n69\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.540\nThe window manager is now\nbeing powered by that, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.440\nAnd when I login,\nthe login window is now running as me.\n\n71\n00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.810\nAnd it looks at my profile and it says,\n\n72\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.900\nokay, what programs did you\nhave open in your last session?\n\n73\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.250\nA let me reopen them.\n\n74\n00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.666\nHere, Google Chrome came on.\n&gt;&gt; It's very nice,\n\n75\n00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:45.371\nactually, I love this feature.\n&gt;&gt; It is, especially if you have a power\n\n76\n00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:47.995\nout, everything just pops\nback the way you want it.\n\n77\n00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:50.250\nIt can be problematic too, though, right?\n\n78\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.140\nLet's say there's something\nwrong with Google Chrome, and\n\n79\n00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.020\nevery time I log in,\nit auto launches Google Chrome and\n\n80\n00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.029\nmy computer reboots.\n&gt;&gt; Fun.\n\n81\n00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:00.512\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then, I log in again and\n\n82\n00:04:00.512 --> 00:04:02.520\nit launches Chrome and it reboots, right?\n\n83\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.510\nI've had this happen, not with Chrome,\nbut with other programs.\n\n84\n00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.091\nSometimes, the nice, convenient, features\ncan be the cause of all your problems.\n\n85\n00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:10.603\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n86\n00:04:10.603 --> 00:04:12.850\n&gt;&gt; That's certainly just happened.\n\n87\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.110\nWell, it's the log in window\nthat's doing this, right?\n\n88\n00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.690\nThe log in window, it collected your\nuser identity, your credentials.\n\n89\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.770\nIt's a token-based system.\n\n90\n00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.182\nSo, it's got your user token.\n\n91\n00:04:22.182 --> 00:04:26.040\nAnd now it's attaching it\nto every program I run.\n\n92\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.917\nSo if I pull up the Activity Monitor,\nand my spotlight's working now,\n\n93\n00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:31.349\ncuz I'm out of safe boot.\n\n94\n00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.533\nIf you watch part two you'll know\nI was frustrated about that.\n\n95\n00:04:33.533 --> 00:04:37.107\nBut if I pull up the Activity Monitor and\nI come in here and\n\n96\n00:04:37.107 --> 00:04:40.225\nstart to look at the programs\nthat I'm running,\n\n97\n00:04:40.225 --> 00:04:44.502\nI can see here in the beginning\nthings like launchd and the kernel.\n\n98\n00:04:44.502 --> 00:04:46.189\nSee how they run as root?\n\n99\n00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:47.641\nThey run as the root user.\n\n100\n00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:49.161\nThose are system services.\n\n101\n00:04:49.161 --> 00:04:51.154\nWe need them to run as root.\n\n102\n00:04:51.154 --> 00:04:55.450\nBut if I start following the PID numbers,\nand I go down.\n\n103\n00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.960\nThey increase as each program runs,\nuntil I get to the loginwindow.\n\n104\n00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.750\nAnd here's the login window.\n\n105\n00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.080\nProcess ID 96.\n\n106\n00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.590\nAnd see how it says it's\nbeing run by D Pezet.\n\n107\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.310\nThat's because I just logged in.\n\n108\n00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.510\nIt was being run as root until I\nlogged in and now it switched.\n\n109\n00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.210\nAnd now it's being run as me.\n\n110\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.880\nIf I had fast user switching enabled,\nand I had more than one account,\n\n111\n00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.850\nI would actually see two login windows.\n\n112\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.993\nOne that's still being run by root, run by\nroot, because someone else could log into\n\n113\n00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:31.151\nthe system, and then one that's being run\nby me, because I'm currently logged in.\n\n114\n00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:36.140\nSo you might have multiple login windows\ndepending on how your system is set up,\n\n115\n00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.489\nbut that one is mine.\n\n116\n00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:40.560\nThis is my login window, there are many\nlike it, but this one is mine.\n\n117\n00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.015\n&gt;&gt; This one is mine, that's right.\n\n118\n00:05:42.015 --> 00:05:46.560\n[LAUGH] So now whenever I run a program,\nwhich I have to move the higher process\n\n119\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.020\nIDs, because most of the others\nare things that came up when we booted.\n\n120\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.810\nAnd so now when I look down here I start\nto see things like the Activity Monitor\n\n121\n00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.150\nwhich is running as me.\n\n122\n00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.810\nI should be able to find the Terminal,\nit's right there.\n\n123\n00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.850\nGoogle Chrome should be in here somewhere,\ndid I close it by accident?\n\n124\n00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.440\nI might've closed it by accident.\n\n125\n00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.190\nSpotlight, right, these are all\nthings that are being run as me, and\n\n126\n00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.010\nthe login window is what's managing that.\n\n127\n00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.680\nNow if every time I log in, Google Chrome,\nthere it is, Google Chrome is crashing,\n\n128\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.160\nbut it's set to auto start,\nthen I've got a real problem, right?\n\n129\n00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.770\nAnd this is a far more common issue than\n\n130\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.540\nany of the other troubleshooting\nscenarios we've let out so far.\n\n131\n00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.840\nAnd it is very unlikely\nto be a hardware problem.\n\n132\n00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.200\nThis is a software problem, right?\n\n133\n00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.180\nSo fortunately we've got an easy\nway to be able to stop those types\n\n134\n00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.584\nof things from firing up automatically.\n&gt;&gt; You buy a new Mac, right?\n\n135\n00:06:40.584 --> 00:06:41.103\n&gt;&gt; You could.\n\n136\n00:06:41.103 --> 00:06:41.639\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n137\n00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.532\n&gt;&gt; You could buy a new Mac,\n\n138\n00:06:42.532 --> 00:06:43.370\nthat would do it.\n\n139\n00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.300\nAlthough if you restore\na Time Machine backup and\n\n140\n00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.800\nthe program's still auto launching,\n\n141\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.660\nyou're right back where you started.\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n142\n00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.736\n&gt;&gt; So you've gotta plan accordingly.\n\n143\n00:06:50.736 --> 00:06:54.220\nBut we can set up these\na few different ways, right?\n\n144\n00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:00.661\nThe easiest way is to do what's called a,\nwell, this gets a little confusing,\n\n145\n00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:05.280\nbecause we saw safe boot\nin the last episode, right?\n\n146\n00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.400\nSafe boot was where I told the computer,\nwhen it boots up, don't load third party\n\n147\n00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:16.660\nkernel extensions and don't load\nthird-party launch team and services.\n\n148\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.380\nSo just kinda trying to keep\nit really small and narrow.\n\n149\n00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.790\nThat doesn't apply to user applications,\nright?\n\n150\n00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.150\nOur user applications\nare controlled in two places.\n\n151\n00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:32.640\nIf I go into my system preferences,\none place is in the user account window.\n\n152\n00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.550\nSo if I come into my Users &amp; Groups and\nI find my user account in here.\n\n153\n00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.980\nSo there's Don Pezet and\nI have Login Items right here.\n\n154\n00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.720\nThese things, there I can see\nGoogle Chrome and Resilio Sync,\n\n155\n00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.760\nITunesHelper, Moon, all these different\nprograms I run when I log in.\n\n156\n00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.313\nIf I can log in, I can always\ncome in here and remove items.\n\n157\n00:07:53.313 --> 00:07:56.981\nI don't want Chrome to launch when\nI log in, so I can pick Chrome,\n\n158\n00:07:56.981 --> 00:07:59.274\nI can hit that minus, I can knock it out.\n\n159\n00:07:59.274 --> 00:08:00.214\nDon't hit Hide.\n\n160\n00:08:00.214 --> 00:08:01.320\nThat just hides it from the menu bar.\n\n161\n00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.306\nIt doesn't do you any good.\n\n162\n00:08:02.306 --> 00:08:07.020\nYou hit the minus to actually remove it\nfrom the list in order to take that out.\n\n163\n00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.740\nIf I can't even log in,\nI can't get to this tool.\n\n164\n00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.625\nThat doesn't help me.\n\n165\n00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:14.405\nIf you had terminal access, or\nif you can log in as another user,\n\n166\n00:08:14.405 --> 00:08:16.160\nyou might be able to fix this.\n\n167\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.110\nNow, if I log in as another user, you\nactually don't see the log in IM screen\n\n168\n00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.900\nfor other users, even if you're\nan administrator, if you're unlocked and\n\n169\n00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.540\neverything you don't see\nother users log in IMs.\n\n170\n00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.010\nBut you could go into the terminal and\nfind it.\n\n171\n00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.680\nThese guys are hidden away usually\nin what are called launch agents.\n\n172\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.970\nI say usually cuz they're\nnot always a launch agent.\n\n173\n00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.900\nIn fact, here, let's see if these show up.\n\n174\n00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.580\nI know that Chrome was set to auto-launch,\nright?\n\n175\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.957\nSo is that a launch agent?\n\n176\n00:08:41.957 --> 00:08:43.210\nWell, we'll find out.\n\n177\n00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:48.606\nI can browse on the hard drive and I can\ngo into /Library/, let's see it'll be,\n\n178\n00:08:48.606 --> 00:08:52.482\nactually I need to look at the user\ncuz it's a per user basis.\n\n179\n00:08:52.482 --> 00:08:56.134\nSo, remember that there's\nmore than one library,\n\n180\n00:08:56.134 --> 00:09:01.446\nthere's four domains, we saw that way\nback in the beginning of the series,\n\n181\n00:09:01.446 --> 00:09:06.011\nthe user library is stored in\nthe users home folder, so if I go into\n\n182\n00:09:06.011 --> 00:09:11.990\n/users/deposit/Library/LaunchAgents, that\nfolder right there.\n\n183\n00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:17.600\nLaunch agents are programs that start when\nyou boot up, all right or when you log in.\n\n184\n00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.133\nAnd so that's what I'm seeing right here\nis there's something from google.com.\n\n185\n00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:24.730\nKeystone, maybe that's keystone agent?\n\n186\n00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.110\nI don't know what that is, but it's some\nkind of launch agent that Google has.\n\n187\n00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.930\nWhich, it may be what's launching Chrome\nor this may be some other Google service.\n\n188\n00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.147\nBut I'm gonna assume it's Chrome,\ncuz I don't see anything else running, but\n\n189\n00:09:35.147 --> 00:09:36.054\nit's a launch agent.\n\n190\n00:09:36.054 --> 00:09:38.760\nThere were other items in my\nstartup though, like Moom, right?\n\n191\n00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.771\nMoom is my little windows resizing utility\nthat I installed from the App Store.\n\n192\n00:09:42.771 --> 00:09:44.590\nIt's not showing up here\non the launch agents.\n\n193\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.260\nAnd so, it's launching some other way.\n\n194\n00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.840\nWhen you go into that settings screen,\nand you go into your users groups and\n\n195\n00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.280\nyou pull up your logging items,\nyou see everything there, right?\n\n196\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.970\nHere, it's not a guarantee\nthat you're going to spot it.\n\n197\n00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.330\nAnd it might not be in this library.\n\n198\n00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.110\nIt could be in one of the other libraries.\n\n199\n00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.790\nIt could be a global one,\nthat's sets up startup for\n\n200\n00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.660\nevery user that logs into this system.\n\n201\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.746\nSo then you'd have to go and\ncheck out /Library/LaunchAgents.\n\n202\n00:10:09.746 --> 00:10:13.080\nThese things shouldn't be so hard to say.\n\n203\n00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.010\nAnd when I look in there I see my\nlittle VNC server control panel,\n\n204\n00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:22.330\nmy Splashtop Streamer, which those\nare all running if I zoom in here.\n\n205\n00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.540\nThere's my Splashtop Streamer and\nVNC, there's those two.\n\n206\n00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.273\nI didn't see those in my\nlog in items earlier.\n\n207\n00:10:28.273 --> 00:10:33.400\nThey're here in these\nlaunch agents folder.\n\n208\n00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.720\nSo, there's different places to go.\n\n209\n00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.687\nAnd that makes troubleshooting\nthis stuff super annoying, right?\n\n210\n00:10:38.687 --> 00:10:42.975\nIf Chrome was crashing before I log in and\nI wanna remove this stuff.\n\n211\n00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:44.115\n&gt;&gt; Where the heck is it hiding?\n\n212\n00:10:44.115 --> 00:10:46.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a pain right?\n\n213\n00:10:46.335 --> 00:10:51.725\nSo what we can do is, instead of safe\nboot like we did in the last episode,\n\n214\n00:10:51.725 --> 00:10:54.015\nwe can do what's called safe mode.\n\n215\n00:10:54.015 --> 00:10:56.704\nSafe mode, and safe boot,\nthey sound pretty darn similar right?\n\n216\n00:10:56.704 --> 00:10:58.226\n&gt;&gt; So, you're trying to confuse me,\n\n217\n00:10:58.226 --> 00:10:59.837\nthough?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes I am.\n\n218\n00:10:59.837 --> 00:11:00.425\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n219\n00:11:00.425 --> 00:11:02.470\n&gt;&gt; Safe boot says,\n\n220\n00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.380\ntell the kernel not to load any\nthird party kernel extensions and\n\n221\n00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.555\ntell launchd,\nnot to launch any third party daemons.\n\n222\n00:11:08.555 --> 00:11:15.622\nSafe mode tells the log in window\nnot to launch any log in items.\n\n223\n00:11:15.622 --> 00:11:20.360\nAll right, it's a different concept,\nbut it's actually done the same way.\n\n224\n00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:26.110\nYou hold the shift key, but you hold\nthe shift key while logging in, right?\n\n225\n00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:30.698\nWith safe boot, I hold shift while I boot\nit, because I'm talking to the kernel, and\n\n226\n00:11:30.698 --> 00:11:31.420\nto launchd.\n\n227\n00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.928\nYou got to do that early on.\n\n228\n00:11:33.928 --> 00:11:36.820\nBut log in window, you can talk\nto it whenever you want, right?\n\n229\n00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.000\nAll I have to do is log out, so\nif I come up here and I'll log out.\n\n230\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.212\nAnd when I log out,\nI'm going to log out, there we go.\n\n231\n00:11:46.212 --> 00:11:50.165\nI'm gonna get to my log in screen,\nI'm gonna type my password,\n\n232\n00:11:50.165 --> 00:11:52.421\ndon't hold shift here, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n\n233\n00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:53.468\n&gt;&gt; So, if you're trying\n\n234\n00:11:53.468 --> 00:11:56.998\nto do safe boot and safe mode, you're\nholding shift at the very beginning,\n\n235\n00:11:56.998 --> 00:12:00.526\nby the time you get here, you have to let\ngo of shift to type in your password,\n\n236\n00:12:00.526 --> 00:12:03.166\nunless you have an all capital password.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah then you're good to go.\n\n237\n00:12:03.166 --> 00:12:04.895\n&gt;&gt; Then it works out, but I do not.\n\n238\n00:12:04.895 --> 00:12:08.459\nSo you can let go of shift,\nyou can type in your password,\n\n239\n00:12:08.459 --> 00:12:13.141\nand once you've typed in your password,\nnow you can hold shift again, and\n\n240\n00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:17.280\nwhile you're holding shift\nclick the arrow to log in.\n\n241\n00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.480\nAnd that's gonna do a safe mode log in,\nright?\n\n242\n00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.743\nNow, when I did safe boot in the last\nepisode, there was a little red note in\n\n243\n00:12:25.743 --> 00:12:29.277\nthe top right corner that said safe mode,\nor safe boot sorry.\n\n244\n00:12:29.277 --> 00:12:30.810\nI knew I was in safe boot.\n\n245\n00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.830\nYou don't get that for safe mode.\n\n246\n00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:38.640\nWhen I come in here, it didn't tell\nme that I'm in safe mode all right?\n\n247\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.930\nBut visually I can look,\nChrome didn't launch, and\n\n248\n00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.070\nthe terminal didn't launch right?\n\n249\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.020\nThose launched earlier they came up,\nthey're part of what I told it to run.\n\n250\n00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:54.310\nAnd if I look up here at my top menu bar,\nI can see that Moom is gone.\n\n251\n00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.300\nIt had a grey M icon, it didn't launch.\n\n252\n00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.090\nMy scroll reverser, my track ball,\nit's a double arrow that was up there.\n\n253\n00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.811\nThat's gone,\nthose log in items didn't run.\n\n254\n00:13:03.811 --> 00:13:06.152\nBut look at Splashtop and VMC,\n\n255\n00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:08.613\nthey're still there.\n&gt;&gt; They're there.\n\n256\n00:13:08.613 --> 00:13:10.139\n&gt;&gt; Those launch agents,\n\n257\n00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:14.850\nlog in window didn't trigger those,\nor safe mode ignored those.\n\n258\n00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.069\nSo sometimes programs sneak through,\n\n259\n00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:21.370\nsome of them if you guys have watched\na lot of my shows, you might know my crazy\n\n260\n00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.454\nrelationship with Wunderlist.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n261\n00:13:23.454 --> 00:13:25.550\n&gt;&gt; Wunderlist is my to do list.\n\n262\n00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.010\nI love it, I use it for everything.\n\n263\n00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.650\nI would not be able to keep\ntrack of things without it.\n\n264\n00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.872\nI cannot, for the life of me,\nfigure out how it starts up.\n\n265\n00:13:33.872 --> 00:13:34.521\n&gt;&gt; It's good.\n\n266\n00:13:34.521 --> 00:13:36.675\nLooks deep into the system, does it?\n&gt;&gt; It does\n\n267\n00:13:36.675 --> 00:13:37.215\nsome magic.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n268\n00:13:37.215 --> 00:13:38.984\n&gt;&gt; If there's no kernel extension,\n\n269\n00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:42.480\nthere's no launch agent,\nthere's no launch daemon.\n\n270\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.250\nI don't know how it starts up.\n\n271\n00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.310\nThe interesting part here is that.\n&gt;&gt; The Wunderlist root kit.\n\n272\n00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.898\n&gt;&gt; Even the Wunderlist people don't know\n\n273\n00:13:48.898 --> 00:13:51.166\nhow it starts up because if\nyou go into the preferences.\n\n274\n00:13:51.166 --> 00:13:52.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n275\n00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.829\n&gt;&gt; It's got a preference in here that says\n\n276\n00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.250\nopen Wunderlist at startup.\n\n277\n00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:59.632\nAnd you'll notice, I've unchecked it.\n\n278\n00:13:59.632 --> 00:14:02.550\nAnd it's still starts up.\n\n279\n00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:07.080\nSo, it does some magic right, so every now\nand then you get a program like this that\n\n280\n00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.380\nis just a stinking nightmare, and the only\nsolution there is just delete the program.\n\n281\n00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.470\nIf I go into the slash applications\nfolder and delete Wunderlist app,\n\n282\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.170\nit's not gonna start when I boot.\n\n283\n00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.930\nThe binaries have to be there, so\n\n284\n00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.920\nsometimes you have to get a little\naggressive with these, but typically,\n\n285\n00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.810\nif something is auto launching when you\nlog in, you just log in in safe mode.\n\n286\n00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:31.540\nHold shift, click that arrow, you'll\nlog in and those programs don't launch.\n\n287\n00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.079\nYou can fix the problem,\nuninstall it, reinstall it,\n\n288\n00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:33.912\nwhatever it is you need to do.\n\n289\n00:14:33.912 --> 00:14:36.787\nAnd then all you have to do is log out and\nlog back in again and\n\n290\n00:14:36.787 --> 00:14:38.500\nyou'll be back in business.\n\n291\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.040\nSo if I log out,\nwhich I will do presently.\n\n292\n00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:47.394\nAnd one of these days I will figure\nout how Wunderlist is launching.\n\n293\n00:14:47.394 --> 00:14:49.500\nBecause whatever they're doing is crazy.\n\n294\n00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.499\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and log in, and\nthis time I didn't hold shift, and so\n\n295\n00:14:53.499 --> 00:14:57.437\nit's gonna say, look you have some\nlog in items, so I'll go ahead and\n\n296\n00:14:57.437 --> 00:15:00.466\ntrigger those and let those come up,\nand do their thing.\n\n297\n00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:05.080\nAnd so here it's going, there's Chrome\nthat didn't launch a few minutes ago.\n\n298\n00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.589\nI don't know if I properly\nexited the terminal or not, so\n\n299\n00:15:07.589 --> 00:15:09.644\nI don't know if the terminal\nis gonna turn up.\n\n300\n00:15:09.644 --> 00:15:13.470\nBut if I look up here in my bar,\nI can see that moon.\n\n301\n00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.060\nThere's that M icon that I mentioned and\nmy double sided arrow for\n\n302\n00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.440\nthe scroll reverser.\n\n303\n00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.670\nThose programs are now launching because\nthat's part of what log in window does.\n\n304\n00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.950\nSo as far as troubleshooting it,\nit's pretty straightforward, except for\n\n305\n00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.000\nthose weird programs\nthat might sneak through.\n\n306\n00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.137\nJust be aware.\n&gt;&gt; You got to love those one offs,\n\n307\n00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:30.050\ndon't you, Don?\n\n308\n00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.250\nIt's always a mystery when you\nare playing with computers.\n\n309\n00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.910\nThat being said, Don, you did mention at\nthe beginning of the show that after we\n\n310\n00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:38.070\ngot through the five phases, which we\nhave successfully done, very good,\n\n311\n00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:42.030\nthat there were some other things that we\nmight wanna take a look at that could help\n\n312\n00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.118\nus with troubleshooting as well.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n313\n00:15:44.118 --> 00:15:47.019\nlet's recap some of the tools that\nI used through all this, right?\n\n314\n00:15:47.019 --> 00:15:49.290\nWe started with hardware diagnostic.\n\n315\n00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.870\nYou can boot your computer up while\nholding the letter D on your keyboard.\n\n316\n00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.412\nAnd that will run the hardware\ndiagnostic and test your hardware.\n\n317\n00:15:55.412 --> 00:15:59.666\nOne thing I didn't show when we talked\nabout that was that if you think for\n\n318\n00:15:59.666 --> 00:16:03.574\nsome reasons that the diagnostic\nsoftware is messed up Then you can\n\n319\n00:16:03.574 --> 00:16:05.830\nactually hold Cmd+D while you boot.\n\n320\n00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.690\nAnd if you do that, it'll try and load\nthe hardware diagnostic from the Internet.\n\n321\n00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:12.220\nBut that requires you to have\na valid network connection and\n\n322\n00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.520\nyour network adapter to be working.\n\n323\n00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.950\nAnd if you're running\nthe hardware diagnostic,\n\n324\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.300\nyou might not have either of those,\nso not incredibly useful.\n\n325\n00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.278\nThat's probably why I didn't mention it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n326\n00:16:20.278 --> 00:16:21.273\n&gt;&gt; But just be aware.\n\n327\n00:16:21.273 --> 00:16:24.200\nBut hold D while you boot\nruns a hardware diagnostic.\n\n328\n00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.400\nGreat way to check the built-in hardware.\n\n329\n00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.260\nIt won't check your external peripherals,\nbut\n\n330\n00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.490\nit will check what's\nbuilt into your hardware.\n\n331\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.550\nWe talked about booting to recovery,\nright?\n\n332\n00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:39.420\nThat you can hold Cmd+R while booting\nto get to your recovery partition.\n\n333\n00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.640\nAnd that's a great way to reinstall\nthe OS or restore from Time Machine,\n\n334\n00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.670\naccess the Disk Utility,\nall of those things.\n\n335\n00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.720\nYou can boot holding the Option key, and\n\n336\n00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.460\nthat will let you pick USB media,\nif you wanna boot off of that.\n\n337\n00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.352\nWe did that in part one.\n\n338\n00:16:53.352 --> 00:16:56.970\nOr if you wanna boot from the recovery\non your Time Machine disk,\n\n339\n00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.250\nyou can boot that way.\n\n340\n00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.229\nRight, there's another\ntechnique that's available.\n\n341\n00:17:00.229 --> 00:17:04.790\nWe talked about a safe boot, which was\nholding Shift down while we booted up to\n\n342\n00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:08.791\ntell the kernel not to load kernel\nextensions from third parties and\n\n343\n00:17:08.791 --> 00:17:12.360\nto tell launchd not to\nlaunch third party services.\n\n344\n00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.577\nAnd we talked about Safe mode,\nwhich was holding Shift while we log in to\n\n345\n00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:21.091\nstop programs from running the moment\nwe log in, to help us get around that.\n\n346\n00:17:21.091 --> 00:17:25.741\nSo those are all tools that we covered\nalong with a particular phase, right?\n\n347\n00:17:25.741 --> 00:17:29.239\nBut there's a few other tools that\nare super handy that don't align with\n\n348\n00:17:29.239 --> 00:17:31.420\na particular phase, all right?\n\n349\n00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.890\nOne of them that I found\npretty useful over the years\n\n350\n00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.940\nis booting into what's\ncalled verbose mode, right?\n\n351\n00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.308\nWhen I boot up a Mac, or you or\nanybody, what do you see?\n\n352\n00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:41.171\nYou see a black screen, and\n\n353\n00:17:41.171 --> 00:17:45.680\nthen you see an Apple with a white\nbar going across it, right?\n\n354\n00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:51.210\nThat white bar technically is representing\nthe firmware cuz you never see that.\n\n355\n00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:56.440\nYou're seeing the boot happen,\nyou're seeing the kernel load.\n\n356\n00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.250\nAnd then you're seeing launchd do stuff.\n\n357\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.040\nAnd then it's really login window,\n\n358\n00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.800\nthat phase before you actually see\nanything besides just an apple with a bar.\n\n359\n00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.700\nIf you boot in verbose mode, instead\nof showing you the apple with the bar,\n\n360\n00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.830\nyou'll see text scrolling\nacross the screen, right?\n\n361\n00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:15.408\nIf you boot a Mac, and you see the apple,\nthe little white bar is going across and\n\n362\n00:18:15.408 --> 00:18:19.260\nthen it just stops, stops and\nsits there, 15 minutes, 30 minutes,\n\n363\n00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.730\nan hour, two hours, just sits there.\n\n364\n00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:25.530\nIt's hung up on something, but because\nthere's four different phases hidden\n\n365\n00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.780\nbehind that little apple,\nyou don't know where it is, right?\n\n366\n00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.840\nIf you boot in verbose mode, you'll see\nthe text rolling across the screen and\n\n367\n00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.220\nyou can spot where it gets stuck.\n\n368\n00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.180\nSo let me show you that.\n\n369\n00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.680\nI'm gonna take this Mac.\n\n370\n00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.450\nAnd whoops, I'm gonna zoom it out so we\ncan kinda see this a little better here.\n\n371\n00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.310\nAnd whoops, or I'm not, I'm gonna-\n&gt;&gt; You go crazy-\n\n372\n00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.472\n&gt;&gt; Crazy things, yeah,\n\n373\n00:18:45.472 --> 00:18:47.890\n[LAUGH] I don't know what I am doing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n374\n00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:48.710\n&gt;&gt; Forgetting how I'm zoomed\n\n375\n00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:49.740\nin is what I'm doing.\n\n376\n00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.570\nSo let me go ahead and shut this down.\n\n377\n00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.950\nAnd once I shut it down,\nyou do the power off for this.\n\n378\n00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:00.230\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nboot while holding Cmd+V.\n\n379\n00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.510\nCmd+V for verbose, right?\n\n380\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.610\nCmd+R was recovery mode,\nCmd+V is verbose, right?\n\n381\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.180\nSo Daniel, if you can let me\nknow when that light goes off.\n\n382\n00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.220\n&gt;&gt; No problem.\n\n383\n00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.450\n&gt;&gt; And when we boot verbose,\n\n384\n00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.354\nif you've ever run Unix or Linux,\nthis will look familiar to you as you're\n\n385\n00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:18.440\nactually seeing the kernel do its work and\nrun programs.\n\n386\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:23.080\nSo I'm holding Cmd+V, I'm pressing that\npower button, and it's gonna boot up.\n\n387\n00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:27.460\nAnd now it's gonna show me what's\ngoing on instead of a pretty apple.\n\n388\n00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.200\nSo there it goes, and\nit's gonna move pretty quick, right?\n\n389\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.571\nToo fast for us to read.\n&gt;&gt; This is super helpful, yeah.\n\n390\n00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you'll hear a lot of people say,\n\n391\n00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.690\nhow am I supposed to make sense of this,\nright?\n\n392\n00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:42.590\nBut remember, if it locks up,\nif it freezes somewhere, the text freezes.\n\n393\n00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.030\nIt sticks, right?\n\n394\n00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.330\nNow it did finally show me the apple, but\ndid you see how fast that bar went across?\n\n395\n00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.670\nCuz it's already done all the work and\n\n396\n00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.200\nthat was just it loading log in window,\nright?\n\n397\n00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.810\nSo I would know there was a problem\nwith log in window if I didn't see this,\n\n398\n00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.600\nthe actual log in field that I've got now.\n\n399\n00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.370\nBut that will show me,\nnot so much firmware.\n\n400\n00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.060\nYou do actually get a little bit of\nfirmware information at the beginning of\n\n401\n00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.930\nit, but you see the booter do its job.\n\n402\n00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.730\nYou see the kernel load.\n\n403\n00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:14.010\nYou see launchd load, and all of the\nservices that launchd loads after that.\n\n404\n00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.030\nYou see all the kernel\nextensions that get loaded.\n\n405\n00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.130\nAnd then you see the handoff\nover to login window.\n\n406\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.800\nSo you can figure out which\nphase something went wrong on.\n\n407\n00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.421\nNow booting in verbose mode like I just\ndid doesn't actually change the boot\n\n408\n00:20:26.421 --> 00:20:27.540\nprocess at all.\n\n409\n00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.820\nIt's all the normal boot, so if I log in\nright now everything works like normal or\n\n410\n00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.320\neverything's broken like normal\ndepending on what status I'm in.\n\n411\n00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.810\nBut I don't have to worry about\nwith safe mode or safe boot.\n\n412\n00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:38.635\nIf I do safe boot,\n\n413\n00:20:38.635 --> 00:20:42.170\nI've got to reboot before I load\nall the kernel extensions again.\n\n414\n00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.860\nHere it's a normal boot.\n\n415\n00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.992\nIt's what we see what was going on.\n&gt;&gt; Just giving you more information, so\n\n416\n00:20:46.992 --> 00:20:49.300\nyou can maybe have a better\nidea of what's happening.\n\n417\n00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.580\n&gt;&gt; And hopefully pinpoint.\n\n418\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.280\nAnd I find it incredibly useful for\nfreezes.\n\n419\n00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.040\nWhen that bar freezes and it's not moving\nany further, you just look at the last\n\n420\n00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.870\nline of text on the screen, and\nthat'll tell you what it was doing.\n\n421\n00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.900\nAnd now you can say,\nall right, that's my problem.\n\n422\n00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.970\nHow do I fix that, right?\nJust kinda helps you to figure that out.\n\n423\n00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.565\nI have had, and this next tool I'm\ngonna show you is a little weird.\n\n424\n00:21:08.565 --> 00:21:12.772\nI've had some weird situations that I've\nhad to deal with over the years, and\n\n425\n00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.999\nthat's not even involving computers.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n426\n00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:17.264\n&gt;&gt; But in the world of computers,\n\n427\n00:21:17.264 --> 00:21:22.160\nI've had some weird permissions\ntype issues or a failed upgrade.\n\n428\n00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.030\nHere, I'll give you a great example cuz\nthis actually happened just a month or\n\n429\n00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:25.860\ntwo ago.\n\n430\n00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:30.192\nI was upgrading a system,\nI'm saying I, someone else,\n\n431\n00:21:30.192 --> 00:21:32.600\nI have a friend.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this guy I know.\n\n432\n00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.740\n&gt;&gt; Who was upgrading the system,\n\n433\n00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:38.090\nthey were upgrading from\nSierra to High Sierra and\n\n434\n00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:44.430\nthe upgrade was almost done and\nthe system failed, it froze, right?\n\n435\n00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.630\nAnd when they went to reboot,\nit booted up.\n\n436\n00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.010\nThey were able to log\nin with their account,\n\n437\n00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.290\nbut they weren't\nan administrator any more.\n\n438\n00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.514\nAnd if you went into the system\npreferences and pulled up users and\n\n439\n00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:58.269\ngroups, they saw the user accounts for\ntheir family and\n\n440\n00:21:58.269 --> 00:22:00.034\nnone of them were administrators.\n\n441\n00:22:00.034 --> 00:22:02.363\nThere were no administrators\non the system any more.\n\n442\n00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.566\nPretty weird, it shouldn't happen.\n&gt;&gt; Is that even possible I mean other than\n\n443\n00:22:06.566 --> 00:22:10.280\nroot, was root still an administrator?\n&gt;&gt; It shouldn't be possible, right?\n\n444\n00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.490\nRoot was still an administrator.\n\n445\n00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.510\nWhat's the root account's password?\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question.\n\n446\n00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.550\n&gt;&gt; We don't know, and\n\n447\n00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:20.250\nyou can't use the sudo command if\nyou're not an administrator, so\n\n448\n00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:24.400\nyou're effectively locked\non your own machine, right?\n\n449\n00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.730\nAnd what happens is when you run\nthe initial configuration wizard,\n\n450\n00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:34.510\nwhen you fire up MacOS the first time,\nthe first user account you create is root.\n\n451\n00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.710\nWell, when you do an upgrade,\n\n452\n00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:40.775\nduring the upgrade your user accounts\nare not an administrator any more.\n\n453\n00:22:40.775 --> 00:22:44.280\nThey're regular users, and when\nthe upgrade finishes it then makes you\n\n454\n00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.630\nadministrators in the new system,\nagain, right?\n\n455\n00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:50.440\nIf the upgrade gets interrupted,\nthat might not happen.\n\n456\n00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:55.390\nAnd so the official Apple stance\nis restore the Time Machine.\n\n457\n00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.090\nYou should have taken\na backup before the upgrade.\n\n458\n00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.840\nThis particular person hadn't done that.\n\n459\n00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.641\nThey didn't have a Time Machine back up,\nI asked.\n\n460\n00:23:01.641 --> 00:23:07.676\nAnd just reinstalling the OS isn't enough.\n&gt;&gt; This person's name wasn't John Lezett,\n\n461\n00:23:07.676 --> 00:23:11.510\nwas it?\n&gt;&gt; I don't think you know them, actually.\n\n462\n00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.409\n&gt;&gt; I thought it was you.\n\n463\n00:23:13.409 --> 00:23:15.960\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't me this time.\n\n464\n00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.850\nI've done other far dumber things.\n\n465\n00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.160\nBut a failed upgrade,\n\n466\n00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.230\nthat was an example where what tool\ndo you use to troubleshoot that?\n\n467\n00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.813\nNobody's an admin, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n468\n00:23:24.813 --> 00:23:27.262\n&gt;&gt; So it turns out what you can do is\n\n469\n00:23:27.262 --> 00:23:30.654\nthere is a way to access\nthat root account,\n\n470\n00:23:30.654 --> 00:23:34.637\neven though you don't know its password.\n&gt;&gt; I'm all ears.\n\n471\n00:23:34.637 --> 00:23:39.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that is you can boot it into\n\n472\n00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.870\nwhat's called single user mode\n&gt;&gt; Single user mode is very special mode\n\n473\n00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.590\nthat Apple doesn't put a lot\nof documentation out there on.\n\n474\n00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.960\nIt boots up the Mac just\nto the command line.\n\n475\n00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.421\nThat's why Apple doesn't talk about it,\nand doesn't load a GUI at all.\n\n476\n00:23:52.421 --> 00:23:57.061\nJust takes you right to the command\nline and logs you in as root, and so\n\n477\n00:23:57.061 --> 00:24:00.190\nyou now have root terminal\naccess on that Mac.\n\n478\n00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.830\nAnd you can mount the file system and\ngo in and change permissions,\n\n479\n00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.950\ntweak things and fix stuff,\nand recreate permissions.\n\n480\n00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.650\nWhatever it is you need to do.\n\n481\n00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.400\nIt's hard, it's not user-friendly.\n\n482\n00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.520\nYou are in the Unix world at that point.\n\n483\n00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.720\nYou're not in the Mac OS world.\n\n484\n00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.680\nBut it is a tool that I've used\nbefore in a couple of scenarios and\n\n485\n00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.770\nthat was one scenario where I used\nit that you could go in there and\n\n486\n00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:25.700\nthere's a way to basically tell the Mac\nto rerun the initial setup wizard and\n\n487\n00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.120\nit'll reflag a user as an admin and then\nyou can give yourself permissions again.\n\n488\n00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.280\nSo let me show you how that works.\n\n489\n00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.810\nHopefully, you don't have to use it but\nbooting in verbose mode,\n\n490\n00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:41.150\nthat was really easy, single user mode,\nyou boot while holding Cmd + S.\n\n491\n00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:45.682\nI was booting holding Cmd + R for\nrecovery, V for verbose,\n\n492\n00:24:45.682 --> 00:24:48.050\nS for single user, all right.\n\n493\n00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.040\nAnd then you let me know\nwhen that light is out,\n\n494\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:50.610\nit's out?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n495\n00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:51.962\n&gt;&gt; Well, that was fast.\n\n496\n00:24:51.962 --> 00:24:53.481\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna hold Cmd + S,\n\n497\n00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:56.530\nI'm gonna hit that power button and\nI'm gonna watch.\n\n498\n00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.430\nNow, this is going to look different\n\n499\n00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:04.250\nthan what you would normally see in a boot\nbecause it's very different, right?\n\n500\n00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.440\nIt looks like vobose mode.\n\n501\n00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:05.990\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n502\n00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.092\nI see the text going across, oops,\n\n503\n00:25:08.092 --> 00:25:09.810\nI still was holding Cmd + S.\n\n504\n00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:13.548\nSo int boots and let me zoom in on this so\nyou can see what it's doing,\n\n505\n00:25:13.548 --> 00:25:15.000\ncuz that is microscopic.\n\n506\n00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.360\nThere we go.\n\n507\n00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.850\nAnd so it's booting and\n\n508\n00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.730\nI can actually see some of the things\nthat I've been talking about,\n\n509\n00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:29.382\nlike, where's my mouse in this thing?\n&gt;&gt; There is no mouse in this thing.\n\n510\n00:25:29.382 --> 00:25:29.951\n&gt;&gt; There is no mouse,\n\n511\n00:25:29.951 --> 00:25:30.850\nI'm booted at command line.\n\n512\n00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.720\nSo important tech tip there.\n\n513\n00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.864\nSo you can see, though,\nif you kinda read up a few lines,\n\n514\n00:25:36.864 --> 00:25:38.766\nDarwin Bootstrapper Version 5.2.0, right?\n\n515\n00:25:38.766 --> 00:25:43.650\nThat's where the booter found the EFI for\nDarwin and\n\n516\n00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:48.540\ncalled the Darwin kernel and\nstarted it up, right?\n\n517\n00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.385\nThat's where it's going and\nI can see that it's firing up my system.\n\n518\n00:25:51.385 --> 00:25:56.750\ncom.apple.xpc.launchd is showing\nthere us process ID 1, right?\n\n519\n00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:00.579\nThere is it launching, I see a few\nother little information there and\n\n520\n00:26:00.579 --> 00:26:05.480\nthen I see a message telling me that it's\nmounted the hard drive as read only.\n\n521\n00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.100\nSo I can browse the hard drive but\nI can't change anything.\n\n522\n00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.450\nAnd then it says, if you want to mount\nat read-write, here is the command.\n\n523\n00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:17.044\nYou need to run sbin/mount -uw forward\n/ that remounts it as read-write and\n\n524\n00:26:17.044 --> 00:26:19.770\nnow you have access to the hard drive.\n\n525\n00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:20.900\nOkay?\n\n526\n00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.583\nAnd not only do you have access to the\nhard drive, we'll see if whoami will work,\n\n527\n00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:29.160\nI'm logged in as root,\nthis account whose password we don't know.\n\n528\n00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.650\nI'm now logged in as that user and it's\na little out of the scope of the show,\n\n529\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.310\nyou actually can set the password for\nthe root accounts, so you do know it.\n\n530\n00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.213\nApple typically doesn't want you logging\nin as that account cuz it can create a bit\n\n531\n00:26:39.213 --> 00:26:40.280\nof a security vulnerability.\n\n532\n00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.970\nBut there are ways to set it.\n\n533\n00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.370\nAs it stands, though,\nI'm now into the system and\n\n534\n00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.700\nI'm able to get in there and work.\n\n535\n00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:51.302\nAnd if I mount that file system\nas read-write, I can run that\n\n536\n00:26:51.302 --> 00:26:57.920\n/sbin/mount -uw and\nthen a forward / to remount it.\n\n537\n00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:03.970\nThey recommend doing a file system check\nand the reason is if there was any damage\n\n538\n00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:07.250\nto the file system, if it was shut down\nimproperly, you should do a check on it.\n\n539\n00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:12.380\nI ran it in, let's see,\nit just double checked to make\n\n540\n00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:16.430\nsure it wasn't in the process of applying\nfile vault, cuz that creates a problem.\n\n541\n00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.370\nThat was fine and\nit looks like it updated it.\n\n542\n00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.240\nLet me just verify that\nupdate actually did happen.\n\n543\n00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.609\nAnd we can see that, yes, so\nit is read-write now, it doesn't say,\n\n544\n00:27:25.609 --> 00:27:28.590\nnormally it says read only write there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n545\n00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.078\n&gt;&gt; So now I can browse in and\n\n546\n00:27:31.078 --> 00:27:36.560\nsee those files, see this system and\nlocate things like launch agents and\n\n547\n00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.820\nKernel extentions and delete those out and\ndo whatever that's I need.\n\n548\n00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:44.130\nIt's straight-up command line and it's\nreally small if you have a retina screen\n\n549\n00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.720\nbecause of the high resolution and\nthese are tiny, tiny letters.\n\n550\n00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.970\nBut you can get in there and\nhopefully recover your system.\n\n551\n00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:50.920\nIt's a neat tool.\n\n552\n00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.430\nHopefully, you never have to use it but\nit is pretty useful.\n\n553\n00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, desperate times call for\n\n554\n00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:59.710\ndesperate measures from time to time, so\nit's another tool to put in your toolkit,\n\n555\n00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.190\nyou never know when you're gonna\nneed this and this is a very,\n\n556\n00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.480\nvery handy one because when you\nlogin in the single user mode,\n\n557\n00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:10.430\nas Don has illuminated us, full\ncapability to do whatever you need to do,\n\n558\n00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.370\nmake the changes necessary,\nhopefully fix your problem and\n\n559\n00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.600\nlog back out, log back in as normal and\ngo back to a normal system.\n\n560\n00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.540\nDon, we've gone through a lot\nof troubleshooting when it\n\n561\n00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.120\ncomes to our system.\n\n562\n00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.440\nAnything else you wanna leave us with,\ntips,\n\n563\n00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.580\ntricks, whatever before we call it a day?\n&gt;&gt; We've got\n\n564\n00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.220\nscattered troubleshooting\nthroughout this whole series.\n\n565\n00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.800\nThere's different tools for different\nareas but as far as the boot process and\n\n566\n00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.200\nthe main things that would stop you from\njust being able to get into the Mac,\n\n567\n00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.420\nthose are it.\n\n568\n00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.990\nIf I'm able to get into the Mac,\n\n569\n00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:39.901\nI usually don't use any of\nthe tools that we've just saw.\n\n570\n00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.020\nI'll run Disk Utility\nright inside of Mac OS or\n\n571\n00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:47.830\nI'll go into the event logs,\nevent monitor, because from there,\n\n572\n00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:51.820\nyou can see log information and search and\nlook for errors and find and fix things.\n\n573\n00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.620\nSo there's plenty of other tools\nonce you're able to get in.\n\n574\n00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.470\nBut if you can't even get in,\nthose tools are no good to use.\n\n575\n00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:02.300\nSo those are all pretty handy things and\nthere's other tools like\n\n576\n00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.808\nbooting into target mode by holding Cmd\n+ T, those are handy and a few others.\n\n577\n00:29:06.808 --> 00:29:09.740\nBut the ones that I've shown you\nare pretty much the tools of the trade you\n\n578\n00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.740\nneed for getting a Mac back up and\n\n579\n00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.630\nrunning.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n580\n00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.380\nWell, Don, thanks so\nmuch for dropping by and\n\n581\n00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.410\nteaching us what we would do when things\ngo wrong inside of our Mac systems.\n\n582\n00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.520\nBut looks like we're out of time for this\nepisode, so we're gonna call it a show.\n\n583\n00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.930\nThank you good folks out there for\nwatching.\n\n584\n00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:26.150\nWe always appreciate you joining us but\nsigning off for ITProTV,\n\n585\n00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.186\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n586\n00:29:28.186 --> 00:29:29.380\nI'm Don Pesset.\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n587\n00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.701\n[MUSIC]\n\n588\n00:29:32.701 --> 00:29:38.378\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
