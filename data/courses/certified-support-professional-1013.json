All right,\n\n7\n00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.220\nwell the Apple Certified Support\nProfessional is designed to\n\n8\n00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.410\nbasically introduce or not so\nmuch introduce but to help people that\n\n9\n00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.650\nare working in environments where\nyou support Apple computers, right.\n\n10\n00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.000\nAnd we were specifically talking\nabout macOS systems, not so much iOS,\n\n11\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.761\nlike iPads and iPhones but people that are\nsupporting iMacs, Mac Minis, MacBook Pros,\n\n12\n00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:38.730\nMacBook Airs, those type of devices they\nall run the macOS operating systems.\n\n13\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.770\nAnd if you're the one responsible for\nhelping those people, you need to\n\n14\n00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.380\nknow the ins and outs, different services\nand software that are part of it and\n\n15\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.990\nthe ways to be able to maintain, manage,\nand troubleshoot those systems and that's\n\n16\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.880\nwhat this series is really all about.\n&gt;&gt; Now you already mentioned a few people,\n\n17\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.210\nbut who else is the show targeted towards?\n&gt;&gt; Well, so\n\n18\n00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.490\nthe main target audience are for\npeople that are already working in IT,\n\n19\n00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.730\nthat are supporting\nnetworks in that have Macs,\n\n20\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.960\nbut I find that it actually works out\nwell for a lot of other people as well.\n\n21\n00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.040\nIt's great for people that are just\ngetting started with macOS.\n\n22\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.380\nI know it's targeted to people\nthat are already in IT but\n\n23\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.320\nhonestly, our first episodes are going\nto be how to get macOS installed and\n\n24\n00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.618\nwe're gonna walk through that process.\n\n25\n00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:19.830\nAnd we will do simple things like how\nto change the wallpaper background or\n\n26\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.100\nwhatever, but that's the most people\nare able to figure out on their own.\n\n27\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.910\nSo, if you're an IT enthusiast and\nyou wanna\n\n28\n00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.840\nget into professionally supporting Mac\nnetworks this is a great place to do it.\n\n29\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.850\nIt's also good for\nWindows system administrators, maybe\n\n30\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.480\nyou work in a Microsoft environment and a\ncouple of your employees now have Macs or\n\n31\n00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.030\na lot of your employees now have Macs,\nright.\n\n32\n00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.790\nThat how it works, they kinda get\na foothold and start to grow and\n\n33\n00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.650\nnow you find yourself in a situation where\nyou are very use to Windows administration\n\n34\n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.130\nbut you've got Macs you\nneed to support as well.\n\n35\n00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.020\nWe tackle that here and\nin fact we have another course is called,\n\n36\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.610\nMac Integration Basics,\nthat really helps with getting Macs to\n\n37\n00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.040\nplay nice with Windows but in this show\nwe're focused entirely on macOS and so\n\n38\n00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.040\nit can help really a large audience.\n&gt;&gt; Is there a certification available for\n\n39\n00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.730\nthe course?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, right, so\n\n40\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.780\nthe title of the course is\nthe Apple Certified Support Professional,\n\n41\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.630\nwhich is ACSP and that directly aligns\nwith Apple's ACSP certification.\n\n42\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.280\nNow there used to be two different\nACSPs that you could get,\n\n43\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.200\nthere was one for the,\nback then it was called OS 10,\n\n44\n00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.119\nso there's the OS 10 support\nessentials and OS 10 server essentials.\n\n45\n00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.950\nWell Apple did away with server\nessentials, now there's just one and\n\n46\n00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.690\nOS 10 got renamed macOS and now we\njust have macOS Support Essentials and\n\n47\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.020\nyou'll hear some people\nstill refer to it that way.\n\n48\n00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.390\nIf you take the official course at\nan Apple training center they call\n\n49\n00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.670\nit macOS Support Essentials, but\n\n50\n00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.326\nwe're tailored towards that certification,\nthe Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n51\n00:02:45.326 --> 00:02:47.290\nYou take this course you\nlearn all the material,\n\n52\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.490\nyou can go to an Apple training center,\nand\n\n53\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.450\nfrom there you can get the certification.\n&gt;&gt; So, in depth\n\n54\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.440\nnow what topics are covered in the course?\n&gt;&gt; The course covers a lot of stuff I\n\n55\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.320\nmentioned that we install macOS, right,\nso we would kind of start off there.\n\n56\n00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.590\nAnd I know some of you\nare probably thinking, boy,\n\n57\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.120\nthat's really easy just installing it but\n\n58\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.190\nthere's actually a number of different\nways that macOS can be installed and a lot\n\n59\n00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.350\nof different things that we need to think\nabout as we're doing that installation.\n\n60\n00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.740\nSo we get a chance to see that, we'll\nalso see how to support user accounts and\n\n61\n00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.280\nmultiple user accounts.\n\n62\n00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.350\nHow to configure networking,\nhow to configure network sharing and\n\n63\n00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.600\nexchanging information between our Macs.\n\n64\n00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.840\nWe'll see system troubleshooting,\n\n65\n00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.770\nwe'll talk about some of the other\nservices that are kinda hidden away in\n\n66\n00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.180\nthe background that we might use\nas part of the administration.\n\n67\n00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.430\nWe'll take a good look at iCloud,\nbecause that's become so important.\n\n68\n00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.730\nWe'll take a good look at Time Machine,\nthe ways that we can back up our Macs and\n\n69\n00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.610\nrestore them very easily and ways that we\ncan even centrally manage that beyond what\n\n70\n00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.930\na normal consumer would have we can\nactually set up a Time Machine server.\n\n71\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.680\nSo, we get a chance to see a lot of\nthe different tools that are available for\n\n72\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.860\nour Macs and keeping it up and\noperational and running nice and smoothly.\n\n73\n00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.090\nAnd then we kind of end the series talking\na little bit more about troubleshooting,\n\n74\n00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.050\ntroubleshooting hardware that we've\nadded and other resources on the system.\n\n75\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.100\nLastly, I just wanna mention\nthat we do highlight security\n\n76\n00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.635\nreally all throughout the series there's\nall sorts of security features built into\n\n77\n00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:07.970\nmacOS that we need to be aware of and\nwe'll learn about them right here.\n\n78\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.882\nAnd I keep saying macOS, we're\nactually focused on macOS High Sierra,\n\n79\n00:04:12.882 --> 00:04:16.839\nthis is the version that's\nfocused on macOS 10.13.\n\n80\n00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.106\nIf you've watched a previous\nversion of this show,\n\n81\n00:04:19.106 --> 00:04:21.165\nwe've done it for\neach of the versions before,\n\n82\n00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:24.768\nthere's always new features that get snuck\nin and so while we don't call out the new\n\n83\n00:04:24.768 --> 00:04:27.963\nfeatures specifically, they're kinda\nsprinkle throughout the series\n\n84\n00:04:27.963 --> 00:04:30.531\nthings that are unique to High Sierra.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Don, now if\n\n85\n00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:34.119\nApple Certified Support Professional\nsounds like a show you'd be interested in\n\n86\n00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:37.775\nand you should be, make sure you check out\nall the episodes in the course library.\n\n87\n00:04:37.775 --> 00:04:41.075\nAnd thank you for watching ITPRO.TV,\nit is binge worthy.\n\n88\n00:04:41.075 --> 00:04:47.802\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
