Certified\nSupport Professional or ACSP.\n\n4\n00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,656\nThe ACSP certification has been around for\nquite awhile with Apple and\n\n5\n00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:17,622\nit's designed for\n\n6\n00:00:17,622 --> 00:00:22,320\ntechnicians that are working in business\nenvironments where you're supporting.\n\n7\n00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,950\nApple computers, right, be they laptops,\nor desktops mostly, but\n\n8\n00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,520\na little bit of mobile, iPad,\niPhone type environments, but for\n\n9\n00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,490\nthe most part we're focusing on\nthe Mac OS ten side of things,\n\n10\n00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,130\nright, that operating system that we\nstill run on laptops and desktops.\n\n11\n00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,640\nACSP is not really designed for\na home user, right,\n\n12\n00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,180\njust a person who's got a single Mac or\ncouple Mac's home and that's it.\n\n13\n00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,790\nWe're really talking about businesses.\n\n14\n00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,820\nWhat do businesses go through\nwhen they deploy Macs, right?\n\n15\n00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,100\nAnd it kind of boils down\nto two different things.\n\n16\n00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,370\nOne is just supporting the native\nenvironment inside of Mac OS ten and\n\n17\n00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,640\nthen the other side is getting it to\ninteract with non-Apple operating systems.\n\n18\n00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,520\nIf you've got Linux systems or\n\n19\n00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,942\nMicrosoft Windows system, you gotta\nget the two to talk to each other.\n\n20\n00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:11,790\nThe ACSP is a nice certification\nthat covers a lot of that.\n\n21\n00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,210\nFrom basic installation which is where\nwe're gonna start, all the way up\n\n22\n00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,050\nto more advanced things like security and\nenforcing policy across your network.\n\n23\n00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,530\nIt's a really cool certification,\ncovers really practical skills.\n\n24\n00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,110\nAll too often we see technical\ncertification that are out there that\n\n25\n00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,740\ncover things that are Esoteric, or\n\n26\n00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,070\nthings that you aren't going to\nimplement in real life land very much.\n\n27\n00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,220\nBut this one, the ACSP, covers real\nworld activities that you can expect to\n\n28\n00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,640\nperform if you're supporting\nApple devices in your network.\n\n29\n00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,938\nThe exam itself is pretty straightforward.\n\n30\n00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,750\nWhat we're gonna be doing\nin this IT Pro TV series,\n\n31\n00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:52,410\nis covering all of the exam objectives\nthat are covered on the actual ACSP exam.\n\n32\n00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,310\nNow before I jump into those objectives,\nlet's talk a little bit about that exam.\n\n33\n00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,000\nUnlike the entry level\nApple certifications,\n\n34\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,050\nlike the Apple Certified Associate or\nACA, those certifications.\n\n35\n00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,350\nThose, you could take those exams at\na Pearsonvue center anywhere you wanted.\n\n36\n00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,220\nYou could actually take\nthem from your desktop.\n\n37\n00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,820\nYou can just go online and take the exam.\n\n38\n00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,610\nFor this one.\n\n39\n00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,010\nFor ACSP, you have to take it at\nan Apple-authorized training center,\n\n40\n00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,290\nan AATC, all right?\n\n41\n00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,790\nYou've gotta locate an AATC near you.\n\n42\n00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,855\nNow, most of the AATCs do run the course.\n\n43\n00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:26,435\nCourse for this certification.\n\n44\n00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:30,345\nThe official course, if you wanna take it,\nis the Yosemite 101 course.\n\n45\n00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:32,674\nBefore that it was the Mavericks 101.\n\n46\n00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:35,435\nThey always name it after\nthe OS it's based on.\n\n47\n00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:39,387\nIt's a great course, it takes usually\nfive days, and you take it in the AATC.\n\n48\n00:02:39,387 --> 00:02:43,705\nWe're gonna cover the same exact content\nhere, the advantage being you can do it at\n\n49\n00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,000\nyour own pace, and get ready for\nthe exam the same way.\n\n50\n00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,140\nBut either way, whether you do the\nofficial course or you watch our shows,\n\n51\n00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,650\nif you wanna get the certification,\nyou've got to take the test at an AATC,\n\n52\n00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,190\nwe don't have any way to\nadminister that to you guys.\n\n53\n00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,830\nYou've got to locate one that's near you,\nif you're like me, the nearest one is\n\n54\n00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,730\nabout two hours away, so I've got\nto hop in the car and drive a bit.\n\n55\n00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,040\nBut you go down there and\nyou can take the exam.\n\n56\n00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,730\nThe exam is a multiple place exam,\nfor the most part.\n\n57\n00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,250\nThere are some drag and drop and\nsome what are called hot spot questions,\n\n58\n00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,980\nwhere they show you a picture and\nyou have to click on an area.\n\n59\n00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,330\nClick on the icon that will take you to a\nutility that can perform this action, and\n\n60\n00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,440\nyou gotta click on the right icon.\n\n61\n00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,060\nThat kind of thing.\n\n62\n00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,440\nDrag and drop will be,\nhere's a list of events,\n\n63\n00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,490\ndrag them and put them in the right order.\n\n64\n00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,780\nIt's pretty straightforward questions,\nno real trick questions, or anything.\n\n65\n00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,680\nYou know what you need to do.\n\n66\n00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,870\nYou answer the question.\n\n67\n00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,170\nAnd you move on.\n\n68\n00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,810\nIt is a big exam.\n\n69\n00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,500\nIt's 80 questions or around 80 questions.\n\n70\n00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,800\nAnd you get two hours to do it in, so\nthat's about a minute and a half per\n\n71\n00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,530\nquestion, which is a pretty decent amount\nof time, if you know what you're doing.\n\n72\n00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,840\nIf you know the content, you won't have\nany problem finishing in time, but\n\n73\n00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,900\nif you have to deliberate on a lot of the\nquestions, you'll run out of time fast and\n\n74\n00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,890\nthat's unfortunate because any question\nyou don't get to is marked wrong, right?\n\n75\n00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,350\nYou don't get credit for those questions.\n\n76\n00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,500\nAll right, as far as taking the exam.\n\n77\n00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,580\nFinding your local AATC,\nthat's a big part of it.\n\n78\n00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,140\nAnd you can go to Apple's website and\n\n79\n00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,320\nthey have where you can\npull that information up.\n\n80\n00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,720\nIn fact, if you haven't been\nto Apple's website yet,\n\n81\n00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,930\nthat's a great place to start\nlearning about this certification.\n\n82\n00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,233\nYou can go to\ntraining.Apple.com/certification,\n\n83\n00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:21,070\nall right?\n\n84\n00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,220\nThat'll take you to the certification\npage, and you'll find in there where\n\n85\n00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,260\nthey've got certifications for creative\nprofessionals like graphics design.\n\n86\n00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,526\nAnd IT Professionals and,\nthey've got the Maverick 10.9 and\n\n87\n00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:36,040\nthe Yosemite 10.10 certifications up now.\n\n88\n00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,800\nThe Yosemite stuff at the time of\nthis taping is not all done yet.\n\n89\n00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,940\nThey're still in the works of creating it.\n\n90\n00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,300\nBut as soon as it's all done,\n\n91\n00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,910\nthey'll phase out the 10.9 certifications\nand you'll see that go away.\n\n92\n00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,870\nIf you go to the webpage and you don't\nsee 10.9 don't don't be surprised.\n\n93\n00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,510\nNow, when we go into 10.10, you'll\nsee a few of the certifications that\n\n94\n00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,910\nare available, and\nthey're only listing three.\n\n95\n00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,890\nThere's actually four.\n\n96\n00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,370\nThe fourth one's not done as of today.\n\n97\n00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,980\nThere's the Apple Certified Associate for\nMac Management Basics, which is for\n\n98\n00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,260\njust the basic administration\nof an Apple device.\n\n99\n00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,370\nThat exam is really straightforward, and\n\n100\n00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,530\nif you're just getting started with this,\nthat's really where you should start.\n\n101\n00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,470\nHere at IT Pro TV, we've already taped the\nseries from Mac Management Basics, we did\n\n102\n00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:25,030\nit for 10.9, but there's no significant\nchanges to that exam from 10.9 to 10.10.\n\n103\n00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,690\nIf you study the 10.9 material, you can\ntake either the 10.9 or the 10.10 exam and\n\n104\n00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,000\nyou'll do just fine.\n\n105\n00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,720\nIt's an inexpensive exam,\nit's $65 to take it.\n\n106\n00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,930\nAnd you can take it.\n\n107\n00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,680\nFrom your own desk you don't\nhave to travel anywhere, so\n\n108\n00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,410\nif your just getting started with Apple\nthat's really where you should start,\n\n109\n00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,210\nall right, the Apple Certified Associate\nfor Mac integration,\n\n110\n00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,140\nthat's getting your Macs to work\ntogether with Windows machines.\n\n111\n00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,010\nThere's a lot of Microsoft Windows\nmachines out there in\n\n112\n00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,550\nbusiness environments.\n\n113\n00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,290\nYou need to get them to\ntalk to each other and\n\n114\n00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,410\nexchange information and that's all that\nwhat that certification is all about.\n\n115\n00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,970\nIt covers some really great stuff.\n\n116\n00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,490\nAgain, we've already taped that series.\n\n117\n00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,080\nWe did it under 10.9,\n\n118\n00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,240\nbut no significant changes, there's a few\nlittle things that have been added.\n\n119\n00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,230\nWe're actually going to record some extra\nvideos to correct for those, but for\n\n120\n00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:16,780\nthe most part it's the same, next is the\nApple Certified Support Professional and\n\n121\n00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,480\nthat's this series that you're\nabout to watch, all right.\n\n122\n00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,710\nThat's the first of the upper\nlevel certifications.\n\n123\n00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,230\nThese are where things start to\nget a lot harder, all right.\n\n124\n00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,080\nThese first two exams,\nthey're pretty easy.\n\n125\n00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,830\nMost people should be able to study and\npass those exams in about a week really.\n\n126\n00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,960\nIf you watch the series and\nhit the book, and\n\n127\n00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,380\nthe book is free you can\ndownload it right from.\n\n128\n00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:37,920\nTheir website.\n\n129\n00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,640\nThat's the book for\nthose guys right there.\n\n130\n00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,530\nYou can download it, study, it should take\nyou a week, maybe two weeks to get ready,\n\n131\n00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,880\nget those certifications and\nhave them on your resume.\n\n132\n00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,530\nBut for\nthe the ASCP it's a lot more material.\n\n133\n00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,980\nIt's a big exam.\n\n134\n00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,630\nIt's a ton of information.\n\n135\n00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,190\nAnd this one's gonna require\na lot more work, all right?\n\n136\n00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,260\nIf you're just getting started,\nstart with these two guys here,.\n\n137\n00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,300\nThere's a lot of overlap.\n\n138\n00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,660\nThe things that you learn here,\nyou'll see again, is ACSP, so\n\n139\n00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,030\nhaving that under your belt, already\nhaving that knowledge is pretty handy.\n\n140\n00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,260\nNow, there's another\nlevel up above this one.\n\n141\n00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,340\nThe ACTC, that's not showing up here.\n\n142\n00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,260\nThat's an Apple Certified\nTechnical Coordinator.\n\n143\n00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,160\nAnd the only reason it's not showing\nup is the 10.10 version is not out yet.\n\n144\n00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,070\nIf I go back to the 10.9 page,\nyou'll see the ACTC right there.\n\n145\n00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,660\nAll right?\n\n146\n00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,790\nI'm gonna use this page for a minute just\nto kind of show you guys how this works,\n\n147\n00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:29,940\nbut basically,\nthe ACSP is where you start, all right.\n\n148\n00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,100\nThe earlier exams, the ACA's,\nthose are not prerequisites.\n\n149\n00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,950\nYou don't have to do those, if you\ndon't wanna do the ACA's, fine, don't.\n\n150\n00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,450\nJust skip right past them.\n\n151\n00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,640\nIf you already have that knowledge and\nyou're ready to move up to the next level,\n\n152\n00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,770\nthen you don't have to bother with it,\nI encourage people to do it but,\n\n153\n00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,520\nit's not a requirement.\n\n154\n00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,880\nThen, the ACSP, that's that first step for\nthe higher level certification.\n\n155\n00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,430\nIt's one show or this series that\nwe're about to do and one exam.\n\n156\n00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,885\nThe exam is the OS 10 or OS X Support,\nthe Essentials 10.10 exam.\n\n157\n00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:03,856\nIt says, 10.9.\n\n158\n00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:05,000\nAnd, it tells you right there.\n\n159\n00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,130\nAvailable only at Apple-authorized\ntraining centers.\n\n160\n00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,040\nAnd if you click on that link,\n\n161\n00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,740\nit will take you where you\ncan find a one near you.\n\n162\n00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,620\nNow they do have the official\nMavericks 101 course, but\n\n163\n00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,670\nthis is what I wanted to point you guys to\nright here, the Exam Preparation Guide.\n\n164\n00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:22,700\nThe Exam Prep Guide has a lot of\ninformation to get you ready for the exam.\n\n165\n00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,542\nAnd the main thing is let me go back to\n10.10 here we go the main thing is when we\n\n166\n00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:31,958\ngo to that Exam Prep Guide, it's a PDF,\nyour machine will download it and\n\n167\n00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,870\nyou'll pull it up here.\n\n168\n00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,000\nIt'll tell you what to expect on the exam.\n\n169\n00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,790\nA lot of the stuff that I've\nbeen saying right here,\n\n170\n00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,090\nthat you've got the entry-level certs,\nand the higher-level certs.\n\n171\n00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,480\nIt'll tell you in here how many\nquestions the exam is, 80 questions,\n\n172\n00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,680\nyou've got to score a 73% to pass.\n\n173\n00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,010\nGeneral information that you'll\nwant to know to be prepared.\n\n174\n00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,370\nBut the most important\npart is right down here.\n\n175\n00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,040\nWhere it goes into the exam objectives.\n\n176\n00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,370\nThe exam, is broken up across\neight different knowledge areas.\n\n177\n00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,350\nPart one is installation and\nconfiguration.\n\n178\n00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,910\nWhat does it take just\nto install Yosemite, and\n\n179\n00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,990\ndo a basic configuration to get it up and\noperational?\n\n180\n00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,470\nThat's the first part.\n\n181\n00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,340\nAnd then they list all\nthe things you should know.\n\n182\n00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,460\nRead through these.\n\n183\n00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,130\nDo you already know all of these?\n\n184\n00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,400\nIf you already know how to\ndo all of these things,\n\n185\n00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,530\nthen you can skip past this section and\ngo to the next one.\n\n186\n00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,860\nOr if you need a refresher,\nif you don't know some of these things,\n\n187\n00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,840\nthen go ahead and watch it.\n\n188\n00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,210\nWatch that show or a couple of shows and\n\n189\n00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,070\nwe'll cover that content\nas we move through it.\n\n190\n00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,420\nAfter that it starts to\nmove into other areas.\n\n191\n00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,470\nLike, if I can scroll down and find it.\n\n192\n00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,680\nThey have like some review and\npractice questions too,\n\n193\n00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,880\nwhich is kind of nice if\nyou're getting ready.\n\n194\n00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,170\nPart two is user accounts.\n\n195\n00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,940\nWe start breaking down the different\ntypes of user accounts in Mac OS,\n\n196\n00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,520\nand how to create them,\nhow to disable them.\n\n197\n00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,990\nAnd all the various things that\nare involved in managing that.\n\n198\n00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,770\nNow, when we talk about managing user\naccounts, they might be local accounts,\n\n199\n00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,400\non your individual machine, but\n\n200\n00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,280\nthey might also be network accounts\non a machine that running OSX server.\n\n201\n00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,650\nThere's different types of accounts\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n202\n00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,460\nAnd then there's also some underlying,\n\n203\n00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,270\nhidden accounts like\nthe root user account.\n\n204\n00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,650\nWe talk about those,\nit's pretty good stuff, right?\n\n205\n00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,840\nThings that you will\nencounter in real life.\n\n206\n00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,350\nAnd so it breaks all those down.\n\n207\n00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,290\nAnd you start to see that information,\nnow for the ACSP,\n\n208\n00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,010\nyou don't see a lot of server items right?\n\n209\n00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,290\nWe'll mention that yeah there's user\naccounts if you have OSX server.\n\n210\n00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,125\nBut we're gonna work with the local.\n\n211\n00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,335\nCouple of accounts here in ACSP.\n\n212\n00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:29,465\nFor those of you moving to the next level,\nthe Apple Certified Technical Coordinator,\n\n213\n00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:32,225\nthat's where the server\ninformation comes in.\n\n214\n00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:37,243\nAnd let me go back to that page\nthat was the, the 10.9 page.\n\n215\n00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:41,675\nI'm just gonna jump back to that one to\nshow you guys how these stack together.\n\n216\n00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:45,400\nThe ACA, that was not a prerequisite.\n\n217\n00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,860\nForgetting the ACSP.\n\n218\n00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,800\nYou don't have to do the ACA's,\nyou can skip past them, and do the ACSP.\n\n219\n00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,500\nBut if you want your\nApple Certified Technical Coordinator,\n\n220\n00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,350\nif you want to get the ACTC,\nyou have to get the ACSP first.\n\n221\n00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,580\nThe ACSP is that first step on\nthat advanced level certification.\n\n222\n00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,760\nYou've got to do the ACSP first.\n\n223\n00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,450\nOnce you've passed it,\nthen you do the ACTC.\n\n224\n00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,840\nAnd when you've passed both,\n\n225\n00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,330\nthat's when you're awarded\nthe Apple Certified Technical Coordinator.\n\n226\n00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,330\nAnd if you look at the two courses,\nyou've got this Mavericks 101.\n\n227\n00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,022\nAnd you've got the Mavericks 201.\n\n228\n00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:22,140\nThe 101 is what we're gonna\nbe covering here in ACSP.\n\n229\n00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,396\nThat's the.\nThe OSX Support Essentials, and\n\n230\n00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:26,925\nwe're doing 10.10, all right.\n\n231\n00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:31,685\nThe other one is OSX Server Essentials\n10.10, all right.\n\n232\n00:11:31,685 --> 00:11:33,585\nThat's why we move the server stuff off.\n\n233\n00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:37,015\nIf you watch the ACSP show, and you're\nlike, man, that was a good show, but Don,\n\n234\n00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:39,265\nyou didn't cover any server stuff,\nare you scared?\n\n235\n00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,215\nWell, no, not scared, I promise.\n\n236\n00:11:41,215 --> 00:11:44,825\nWell, maybe a little, but we moved it off\nto another show, right, cuz it's covered\n\n237\n00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:48,700\nin that OSX server essentials, so\nthat's what we're gonna tackle.\n\n238\n00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,970\nThe two combined, it's two exams.\n\n239\n00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,940\nYou pass them both and you get your ACTC.\n\n240\n00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,200\nThat's usually the certification\nthat people are reaching out for\n\n241\n00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,650\nACST looks good on your resume,\nit'll help you get in and get that job.\n\n242\n00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,160\nACTC is when you really show that\nyou have expert level knowledge\n\n243\n00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,150\nof implementing max in\na business environment.\n\n244\n00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,200\nIn a home environment,\nyou're not gonna have a server, but\n\n245\n00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,400\nin a business environment, you will and\nthat server knowledge is really important\n\n246\n00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,470\nand so that ACTC is a great\ngoal to reach out for, right?\n\n247\n00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,590\nThat's not what we're covering in\nthis show, we're doing ACSP, so\n\n248\n00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,820\nlet's talk a little bit about some of\nthe things that were covered in there.\n\n249\n00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,370\nWe are gonna talk about installation and\nconfiguration, right?\n\n250\n00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,570\nWe already saw that.\n\n251\n00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,760\nWe are going to talk about,\nuser accounts, and the user accounts\n\n252\n00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,510\nthat are on the system, the pre-built ones\nas well as ones that we make ourselves.\n\n253\n00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,500\nWe are gonna look at the file system,\nthat mac OS uses.\n\n254\n00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,370\nAs far as the Apple\nsupported ones like HFS,\n\n255\n00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,600\nas well as third party ones like NTFS, and\nCDFS, and we'll get a chance to see those.\n\n256\n00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,550\nWe're gonna take a look\nat data management.\n\n257\n00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,490\nAs far as things that we can do with the\ninformation we store on our hard drives.\n\n258\n00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,450\nYosemite introduced\nsome really cool stuff.\n\n259\n00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,970\nLike universal tagging.\n\n260\n00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,890\nAnd if you haven't used that yet\nit's really cool.\n\n261\n00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,160\nWe'll get a chance to see some of those.\n\n262\n00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,590\nWe're gonna talk about applications and\nprocesses.\n\n263\n00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,190\nHow do we install applications and\nkeep them updated.\n\n264\n00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,770\nAnd how do we control the applications?\n\n265\n00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,240\nIf we have one start to run wild and\n\n266\n00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,050\neat up all of our CPU,\nhow do we even know that happens?\n\n267\n00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,640\nWe'll get a chance to see that and\nhow to with them.\n\n268\n00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,840\nWe're gonna do network configuration.\n\n269\n00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,500\nIn this day and\n\n270\n00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,900\nage it's a rare computer that isn't\nat least connected to the Internet.\n\n271\n00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,400\nBut more importantly, I wanna\nconnect your computers together, so\n\n272\n00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,990\nthey can exchange information.\n\n273\n00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,770\nWe'll get a chance to\nsee that in networking.\n\n274\n00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,060\nWe'll also see system management.\n\n275\n00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,290\nSystem management ranges from\nkeeping our systems up to date,\n\n276\n00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,500\nas well as controlling\ntheir configuration.\n\n277\n00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,670\nWe'll get e few examples there to see how\nto keep our systems nice and clean and\n\n278\n00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,210\noperating smoothly.\n\n279\n00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,990\nThen we wrap up the series\ntalking about security, and\n\n280\n00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,240\nit's actually a part of system management.\n\n281\n00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,580\nWe'll see the firewall, the gatekeeper,\n\n282\n00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,050\nsome of the other applications\nthat Apple builds in.\n\n283\n00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,650\nTo keep your computer safe, so that you\ndon't have to worry about viruses and\n\n284\n00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,280\nall that mess, but the other guys do.\n\n285\n00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,880\nThat's the general range of topics\nthat we're gonna be covering.\n\n286\n00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,675\nRemember that ASCP is focused on Yosemite\nitself, on the operating system.\n\n287\n00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:09,425\nVersus, the ACTC which moves\nto the server side and\n\n288\n00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:13,615\nnow starts to get a little more different,\nblended services across the network.\n\n289\n00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:17,345\nTwo kind of different areas\nthat we're gonna jump into.\n\n290\n00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:20,992\nWell all of that sounds excited and\ninteresting to you,\n\n291\n00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:26,280\nthen you're in the right place, stay\ntuned, our ACSP series is starting next.\n\n292\n00:14:26,280 -->

of our\n\n6\n00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,810\nACSP series our Apple Certified\nSupport Professional series and\n\n7\n00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,170\nwe're really excited about this one.\n\n8\n00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,400\nI know we did the ACA training a few\nmonths back, and our viewers really\n\n9\n00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,350\nenjoyed it, so we're continuing on\nwith the more advanced training today.\n\n10\n00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,770\nAnd in fact we're diving right\ninto the very beginning with part\n\n11\n00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,930\none of the objectives.\n\n12\n00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,801\nNow if you don't have the exam\nobjectives in front of you,\n\n13\n00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:12,571\nyou can always go to Apple's website at\ntraining.apple.com//certification and\n\n14\n00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:17,642\nyou can download the exam prep guide for\nthis exam the ACSP 10.10 exam.\n\n15\n00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:18,339\nAll right.\n\n16\n00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:20,275\nAnd in there it will have all\nthe information as far as\n\n17\n00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:21,200\nwhat's being covered.\n\n18\n00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,730\nIn fact,\nlet me pull this thing up here real quick.\n\n19\n00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,870\nI've got that guide right\nhere in front of me.\n\n20\n00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,630\nIf you pull it up and jump into the guide,\n\n21\n00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,960\nwhat you'll see is\na section labeled Part One.\n\n22\n00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,450\nAnd it will list all of the different\nthings that were covered.\n\n23\n00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,610\nAnd so here we are in Part One,\ninstallation and configuration.\n\n24\n00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,870\nNow normally when we film\nshows here at ITProTV,\n\n25\n00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,300\nwe try to keep one\nepisode to one objective.\n\n26\n00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,240\nWe try and match those up together.\n\n27\n00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,250\nBut Apple divides it up into so\nmany objectives, and so many of them would\n\n28\n00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,405\ntake just two minutes to cover, we're\ngonna combine objectives into the show.\n\n29\n00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,850\nSo in this particular show,\n\n30\n00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,630\nwe're gonna tackle things you\nneed to do before you install.\n\n31\n00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,070\nSo all the prep work and\n\n32\n00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,440\nthings we need to know before we\nactually do that Yosemite install.\n\n33\n00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,630\nIn our next episode we'll\nactually do the install.\n\n34\n00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,930\nIn a third one, we'll actually\ndo the upgrades and migrations.\n\n35\n00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,781\nSo we're kind of dividing it up into three\ndifferent pieces to cover all of these\n\n36\n00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:17,996\ndifferent objectives.\n\n37\n00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:22,790\nNow if you study the 10.9 process,\nnot very much has changed.\n\n38\n00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,130\nBut there are some key things that have\nchanged that may show up on the exam.\n\n39\n00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,430\nAnd one of the important ones is\nthe very first thing that I wanna\n\n40\n00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,790\ntalk about which is.\n\n41\n00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,515\nHow do you know if you can even\ninstall Yosemite on your hardware?\n\n42\n00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:34,310\nRight.\n\n43\n00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,210\nThere's a couple things we need to be\naware of before we even consider it.\n\n44\n00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,410\nJust because Apple released a new\noperating system doesn't mean you need to\n\n45\n00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,420\njump right out and install it today.\n\n46\n00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,320\nThere are reasons why you might wait.\n\n47\n00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,610\nNow, I will say that with Apple products\nthey have a faster adoption rate of new\n\n48\n00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,370\nversions of software than any other\nvendor that's out there, right.\n\n49\n00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,880\nIt's not even close to comparison.\n\n50\n00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,390\nFor example, when Apple releases a new\nversion of iOS for their iPhones and\n\n51\n00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,187\niPads, they'll have a 50% to 60%\nadoption rate within a matter of months\n\n52\n00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:07,420\nversus Microsoft.\n\n53\n00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,820\nWhen they release a new\nversion of Windows,\n\n54\n00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,150\nit takes them years to\nget even close to 50%.\n\n55\n00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,710\nSo, it's not even a close\ncomparison between the vendors.\n\n56\n00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,710\nPeople are excited to run the new\nversions of Mac unless they come out, but\n\n57\n00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,740\nthere's some things that could stop us.\n\n58\n00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,080\nThe first thing that could stop us is our\nhardware right, we all know that Mac OS\n\n59\n00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,173\nwill only run on Apple hardware, if\nyou're running it on non-Apple hardware,\n\n60\n00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:37,628\nit's either extremely old, like the really\nold clones which Yosemite won't run on.\n\n61\n00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:40,840\nOr you're [LAUGH] running on a Hackintosh,\nwhich is not covered on the exam.\n\n62\n00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,960\nSo we're not gonna worry about those.\n\n63\n00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,410\nSo step one we need to make\nsure we have Apple hardware.\n\n64\n00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,330\nStep two, we need to make sure\nthe hardware is on Apple's supported list.\n\n65\n00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,190\nEvery time Apple releases a new\nversion of their operating system,\n\n66\n00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,300\nthey always post a list to specify\nwhat hardware can run it, all right.\n\n67\n00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,670\nAnd you can pull it right\noff of Apple's website.\n\n68\n00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,560\nI've got the website pulled up somewhere.\n\n69\n00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,420\nHere we go.\n\n70\n00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,710\nThey put out a little\nknowledge based article.\n\n71\n00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,410\nThis is the one, and I'll put\nthe link to this in the show notes so\n\n72\n00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,700\nyou guys can have it, but basically\nthis is the how to install all OS 10 or\n\n73\n00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,200\nOS X Yosemite on your Mac.\n\n74\n00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,260\nAnd right here, before you begin.\n\n75\n00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,670\nBefore you even think about starting,\nis your hardware in this list?\n\n76\n00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,270\nAll right.\n\n77\n00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,313\nNow, if you look the oldest\nhardware supported,\n\n78\n00:04:24,313 --> 00:04:29,246\nthey've got the iMacs from mid 2007 and\nthe MacBook Pros from mid 2007.\n\n79\n00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:31,913\nIf you've got a device that was\nmanufactured prior to that,\n\n80\n00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:33,750\nit's not supported, all right.\n\n81\n00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,880\nEven some of the devices that were\nmanufactured in 2007 are not supported.\n\n82\n00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,320\nNow that is eight years ago.\n\n83\n00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,290\nThat's a long time.\n\n84\n00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,960\nSo Apple is doing their best to go\nback a good ways for hardware but\n\n85\n00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,290\nthey can't go back forever.\n\n86\n00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,260\nSo if you've got hardware that is not\non this list you will not be able to\n\n87\n00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,160\nrun Yosemite.\n\n88\n00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,440\nSo you can stop right there,\nskip the rest of the module, right.\n\n89\n00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,950\n[LAUGH] No way to install it on those.\n\n90\n00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,030\nAll right, but if you're hardware\nis on the list you'll be fine.\n\n91\n00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,290\nNow one problem I have is\nthat I know my laptop,\n\n92\n00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,260\nI know exactly which one\nof these my laptop is and\n\n93\n00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,400\nwhether I fit into this, but for a lot\nof people they don't necessarily know.\n\n94\n00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,240\nYou get a laptop and you're like well,\nis this mid-2007 or is it early 2008?\n\n95\n00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,510\nI don't know.\n\n96\n00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,720\nSo we need to go into a little information\ngathering on our hardware to make sure\n\n97\n00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,960\nwe're in good shape.\n\n98\n00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,760\nAnd so we're gonna see that here in\nthis episode, as we go through and\n\n99\n00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,220\ndo that and a basic information gathering.\n\n100\n00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,944\nAll right.\n\n101\n00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:27,970\nA few things to keep in mind, things\nthat they don't mention on this page.\n\n102\n00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,300\nMaybe they do mention it.\n\n103\n00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,020\nThey do,\nif I scroll down a bit you'll see it.\n\n104\n00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,180\nThis is the easiest way to\ntell if you can do the update.\n\n105\n00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,270\nIf your device is listed right here,\nyou'll be good.\n\n106\n00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,880\nBut they have a little bit\nmore down here at the bottom,\n\n107\n00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,160\nwhich basically says some of\nthe generic requirements.\n\n108\n00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,440\nYou need to have at least two gigs of RAM.\n\n109\n00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,880\nIf you have less than two gigs of memory,\n\n110\n00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,630\neven if your device is in this list up\nhere, it won't be supported, all right.\n\n111\n00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,630\nSo you've gotta have two gigs of RAM.\n\n112\n00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,500\nYou need to have eight gigs or\nmore of available disk space.\n\n113\n00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,920\nJust doing the installation takes\nabout eight gigs of space and\n\n114\n00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,700\nyou'll probably need a little\nmore to finish it off.\n\n115\n00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,040\nBut you'll need at least that\nmuch room on your device.\n\n116\n00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,800\nAnd then the other thing is if your\ndevice is in this list up above\n\n117\n00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,840\nIt should already be running\non of the modern OS's, right.\n\n118\n00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,000\nSo they draw the line at Snow Leopard,\nwhich is version 10.6.8.\n\n119\n00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,100\nIf you're running an earlier\nversion of Mac OS,\n\n120\n00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,325\nif you're just running 10.6 or something\nlike that, you need to upgrade to\n\n121\n00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:33,100\n10.6.8 first before you can\nupgrade to Yosemite, all right.\n\n122\n00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,190\nSo there's not a direct upgrade\nfrom OS's prior to that.\n\n123\n00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,590\nWell If you're running\nan OS prior to that,\n\n124\n00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,410\nthen your hardware is probably not on this\nlist anyway, so it's not likely an issue.\n\n125\n00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,690\nBut I think there is at least one\ncombination where you can have that,\n\n126\n00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,400\nand you just have to do a stepped\nupgrade or a clean install, right.\n\n127\n00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,710\nYou don't have to do an upgrade.\n\n128\n00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,300\nAn upgrade is nice, because it preserves\nall of your user settings, and\n\n129\n00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,090\nyour applications and all that.\n\n130\n00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,790\nBut you could choose to just\nformat your hard drive and\n\n131\n00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,850\ndo a fresh new clean install.\n\n132\n00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,520\nI know I like to do that from time to\ntime just to keep my system clean.\n\n133\n00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,880\nI acquire so much junk software.\n\n134\n00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,280\nI shouldn't say junk, just software\nI tried out and then forgot about.\n\n135\n00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,200\nYou leave it laying around and\nyou've got preferences for\n\n136\n00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,930\nit and some nice little\nformat you can start fresh.\n\n137\n00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,960\nBut it's up to you.\n\n138\n00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,810\nYou don't necessarily have to do that.\n\n139\n00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,550\nAll right.\n\n140\n00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,960\nSo we need to make sure that\nour hardware is supported.\n\n141\n00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,590\nIf we're in the list that's great.\n\n142\n00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,230\nBut how do I know how much memory I have?\n\n143\n00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,830\nWhen you buy a laptop you\nbuy a desktop you pick\n\n144\n00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,840\non the website how much\nmemory you wanna have.\n\n145\n00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,280\nAnd maybe you pick two gigs.\n\n146\n00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,620\nMaybe you only pick one gig.\n\n147\n00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,720\nIt's up to you, right.\n\n148\n00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,560\nOr maybe you bought it as a refurb and\nit was modified when they repaired it.\n\n149\n00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,980\nYou don't know how much memory it has.\n\n150\n00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,490\nSo we may need to dive into the system and\n\n151\n00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,700\ndetermine that from Mac OS itself,\nall right.\n\n152\n00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,340\nAnd fortunately,\nit's pretty easy to do that.\n\n153\n00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,150\nWe got a couple of tools available\nin the OS that'll give us\n\n154\n00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,530\nall the information that we need.\n\n155\n00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,353\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at some of that, right.\n\n156\n00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:56,138\nHow do we find out whether or\nnot we've got that?\n\n157\n00:07:56,138 --> 00:07:59,382\nAnd if you're following along\nthe official objectives,\n\n158\n00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:03,684\nwhat we just saw was State the minimum\nhardware and software requirements for\n\n159\n00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,356\ninstalling Mac OS Yosemite.\n\n160\n00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:06,360\nThat's what just saw.\n\n161\n00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,170\nI guess I could stop being lazy and\nactually pull up my objectives.\n\n162\n00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,690\nHere we go.\nThe problem with the objectives is that\n\n163\n00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,620\nthey're kind of out of order so I don't\nnecessarily know exactly where that one is\n\n164\n00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,850\nbut it's in here somewhere\nin this giant list of stuff.\n\n165\n00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,160\nBut what we're going to talk about now is\nhow can we actually get that information\n\n166\n00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,300\nif we don't have it.\n\n167\n00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,020\nAnd it's pretty easy to do that.\n\n168\n00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,090\nLet me get rid of all my windows here.\n\n169\n00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,550\nIf I'm sitting down on\na computer running Mac OS,\n\n170\n00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,480\nthere's two places I can go to get\nall the information that I need.\n\n171\n00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,050\nThe first place is right\nhere under my Apple menu.\n\n172\n00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,170\nIf you go in your Apple menu and\n\n173\n00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:44,330\ngo to about this Mac,\nyou'll get some really good data.\n\n174\n00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,700\nThe first thing is it'll tell\nyou what OS you're running.\n\n175\n00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,470\nAnd I'm already running Yosemite, but\n\n176\n00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,830\nif you're running 10.9.2 or 10.6.8 or\nwhatever it'll say right here.\n\n177\n00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,110\nIt'll say the codename, so\nmaybe you're running Leopard or\n\n178\n00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,120\nMountain Lion or Snow Leopard or\nwhatever, it'll say that codename.\n\n179\n00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,980\nAnd then you'll have\nthe actual version number,\n\n180\n00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,100\nwhich can be a little\nmore useful sometimes.\n\n181\n00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:13,050\nBecause if I say I'm running,\nmaybe I say that I'm running Mavericks,\n\n182\n00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,780\nall right, let's go with that one, I'm\ntrying to think of a good example here.\n\n183\n00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,200\nI might be running Mavericks but it might\nbe 10.9 stock, it might be 10.9.1, 10.9.2,\n\n184\n00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,420\nand that can have a little bit of\na barring on our install in some cases.\n\n185\n00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,530\nEspecially with the older\nones where you've got to\n\n186\n00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,830\nhave 10.6.8 specifically\nto do that upgrade.\n\n187\n00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,230\nBut the other thing is\nwe get the nice name.\n\n188\n00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,910\nThey call it the friendly name for\nour laptop or desktop.\n\n189\n00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,130\nSo I can see mine is a Macbook Pro retina,\n13 inch late 2013.\n\n190\n00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,100\nOkay, it's good that they have that\nbecause if I think about it, I know mine's\n\n191\n00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,120\na 13 inch laptop and I know it's a MacBook\npro and I know it's a retina display.\n\n192\n00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,430\nThose are the things I know,\nbecause I look at the thing.\n\n193\n00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:59,400\nBut I bought this laptop in, I want to say\nit was May of 2014, so I got this about,\n\n194\n00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,670\nI guess it's about nine months ago now, so\nin May of 2014 is when I got this laptop.\n\n195\n00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,880\nWell I don't think of it\nas a late 2013 model,\n\n196\n00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,550\nto me I got it in the summer of 2014.\n\n197\n00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,930\nSo being able to recognize\nwhat that friendly name is,\n\n198\n00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,640\nis going to help me match\nthat up with the website.\n\n199\n00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,420\nSo now I know I got a MacBook Pro Retina\n13 inch, late 2013.\n\n200\n00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,811\nAnd when I go back to Apple's website.\n\n201\n00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:25,988\nAnd I look at this list,\nI can say well I've got a Macbook Pro,\n\n202\n00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:28,850\nand they're telling me mid to late 2007 or\nnewer.\n\n203\n00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:34,600\nI'm definitely within that range, so\nI'm covered, I'll be able to run it.\n\n204\n00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,180\nThe other thing is,\nwe can see how much memory we have.\n\n205\n00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,940\nRemember, we've got to have at least\ntwo gigs of memory to do the install.\n\n206\n00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,570\nI can see right here I've got\nsixteen gigs so I'm covered.\n\n207\n00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,650\nIf you've got two gigs,\nyou're covered there too.\n\n208\n00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,330\nYou just have to have enough memory for\nthat install.\n\n209\n00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,700\nSo good stuff there.\n\n210\n00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,110\nThere is another nice thing that's on\nthere, you'll see you serial number.\n\n211\n00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,540\nThe serial number for an Apple device,\n\n212\n00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,810\nif it's on a laptop, is actually\nprinted on the bottom of the laptop.\n\n213\n00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,570\nIt's usually written in\na really light color.\n\n214\n00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,040\nLike a white ink on your gray laptop,\nso it's hard to see but it is there.\n\n215\n00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,370\nYou can find that serial number.\n\n216\n00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,320\nIf you've got a Mac mini or\na Mac Pro, a desktop unit.\n\n217\n00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,460\nWell it's printed on those too but\nyou probably stuck it under your desk or\n\n218\n00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,410\nsomewhere where it's hard to see.\n\n219\n00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,250\nSo it's nice to be able\nto get at that here.\n\n220\n00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,450\nNow why would I need my serial number?\n\n221\n00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,210\nWell there's two reasons.\n\n222\n00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,430\nOne If you go into here and\nit doesn't have the friendly name.\n\n223\n00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,170\nIf you are running an older OS,\nit might not have a friendly name.\n\n224\n00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,320\nIn which case,\nyou can take that serial number, and\n\n225\n00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,780\nyou can go to Apple's website and\nplug that in.\n\n226\n00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,440\nIt will tell you what it is.\n\n227\n00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,820\nYou can find one way or another.\n\n228\n00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,370\nThe other thing is if,\n\n229\n00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,280\nyou're not sure of how much memory\nthis unit was supposed to have.\n\n230\n00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,770\nIt might be saying that its\nonly got one gig of RAM, but\n\n231\n00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,670\nyou know it's supposed to have two.\n\n232\n00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,560\nMaybe you've got some memory that's\nfailing, and it's not showing up.\n\n233\n00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,510\nYou could plug your serial number into\nApple's website, and it will tell you\n\n234\n00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,960\nhow much memory you were supposed to have,\nor how much it shipped with.\n\n235\n00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,640\nYou can kind of figure out from there.\n\n236\n00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,830\nThose are reasons you might need the\nserial number I guess the third reason is\n\n237\n00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,140\nif you call Apple for help.\n\n238\n00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,310\nIf you call them for help and say hey can\nI install Yosemite on this device and\n\n239\n00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,290\nthey'll say well give me\nyour serial number and\n\n240\n00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,000\nyou provide the serial number and\nthen they'll tell you.\n\n241\n00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,400\nIt's very easy to pull tat up so\nthat information is all right there too.\n\n242\n00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,530\nAll right, so\nlot's of good data to be found.\n\n243\n00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,990\nBut there are other things.\n\n244\n00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,740\nLike we mentioned that you need to\nhave at least 8 gigs of hard drive\n\n245\n00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,080\nspace available.\n\n246\n00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,670\nDoes this tell me?\n\n247\n00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,840\nNo.\nThat's information that's not found\n\n248\n00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,920\nhere, right?\n\n249\n00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,340\nSo instead what I need to do is, I need to\nlook at my storage and I'm on my Overview\n\n250\n00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,710\ntab, but you'll see where we've got\nDisplays and Storage and here I can see my\n\n251\n00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,370\nstorage and now I can get an idea\nof how much space I have available.\n\n252\n00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,850\nI have a 500 gig hard drive, and\n\n253\n00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,850\nI can see that I'm using\na little less than half of it.\n\n254\n00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,160\nI have plenty of space.\n\n255\n00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,660\nYou are just looking for\nthis free number right here.\n\n256\n00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,830\nYou want it to be greater than eight gigs.\n\n257\n00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,730\nOther ways, you can just pull up\nthe properties for your hard drive.\n\n258\n00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,040\nRight click or do a command i.\n\n259\n00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,010\nYou can go in here and\npull up the information for it.\n\n260\n00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,990\nWhen you do that, it will show you\nexactly how much space is available.\n\n261\n00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,980\nSo that's this get info.\n\n262\n00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,070\nI always do command i so\nI had to hunt for that option there, but\n\n263\n00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,410\nyou'll see right in here 288 gigs free.\n\n264\n00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,240\nWhy is that number different?\n\n265\n00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,970\nThat's interesting.\n\n266\n00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,370\nBut I've got 288 gigs available\nover here on the left, and\n\n267\n00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,350\nover here on the right\nit's only 212 gigs free.\n\n268\n00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,540\nA little bit of a disparity\nbetween the two numbers,\n\n269\n00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,100\nbut either way it's more than eight gigs.\n\n270\n00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,370\nActually a big disparity\nbetween the numbers.\n\n271\n00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,150\nInteresting.\n\n272\n00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,060\nOh well.\n\n273\n00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,160\nThis one might not be counting\nstuff in my recycle bin, and\n\n274\n00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,580\nthis one might be counting it or\nvice versa.\n\n275\n00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,120\nI don't know.\n\n276\n00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:35,520\nAll right, so a lot of the information we\nwant can be obtained from right there.\n\n277\n00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,100\nIf you're on the phone\nwith tech support though,\n\n278\n00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,910\nif you're on the phone\nwith like AppleCare,\n\n279\n00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,270\na lot of times they'll ask you to\nuse a different utility though.\n\n280\n00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,800\nThere's the system information utility.\n\n281\n00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,500\nIf you go into to, well,\nif we want to browse to it,\n\n282\n00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,080\nit's in our Applications folder.\n\n283\n00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,250\nIf you go under Applications,\nand Utilities.\n\n284\n00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,990\nSo inside of Applications I'm going\nto go into my Utilities folder.\n\n285\n00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,500\nAnd inside of Utilities you'll\nfind System Information.\n\n286\n00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,720\nThat guy right there.\n\n287\n00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,460\nAnd that one can give you a ton of\ninformation about your computer.\n\n288\n00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,950\nNow if you're going to call Apple,\na lot of times they'll have you come here.\n\n289\n00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,270\nBecause you can actually export this and\nsend it to them.\n\n290\n00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,480\nAnd they can pull up all sorts\nof good data about your system.\n\n291\n00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,080\nBut for us there's two main\nthings that we want, and for\n\n292\n00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,160\nright now it's this hardware overview\nis what I'm concerned about, but\n\n293\n00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,270\nlater on in the show we'll take\na look at the software overview too.\n\n294\n00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,540\nBut on the hardware side you get the same\nbasic information that was under the Apple\n\n295\n00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,450\nmenu, when we clicked on the Apple\nmenu and went to About This Mac.\n\n296\n00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,240\nI see that same data.\n\n297\n00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,350\nI've got my serial number,\nI've got my memory, right?\n\n298\n00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,520\nMy processor.\n\n299\n00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,290\nI don't have my friendly name for\nthis hardware, right?\n\n300\n00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,580\nBut it's got that model identifier,\nthat's where the friendly name comes from.\n\n301\n00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,280\nSo you've got that same basic information\nin a slightly less user friendly format\n\n302\n00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,040\nbut designed to be easy\nto hand off to support.\n\n303\n00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,580\nAnd if you expand out hardware you can\nlook down the list and find storage.\n\n304\n00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,250\nAnd you can find that information\nabout the storage right there.\n\n305\n00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,090\nNow let's see if my laptop\nis affected by this.\n\n306\n00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,360\nThere is actually a little bug in\nthe system information utility.\n\n307\n00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,770\nLet's see.\n\n308\n00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,130\nOh, my laptop's not affected by it.\n\n309\n00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:06,940\nAll right.\n\n310\n00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,920\nThere are some laptops that\nare affected by a bit of a bug on this.\n\n311\n00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,220\nWhere if you launch it,\nthis might look just blank white and\n\n312\n00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,850\nyou don't see anything.\n\n313\n00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,070\nAnd then if you resize your\nwindow all the letters run\n\n314\n00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,000\nvertically right down\nthe side as one letter.\n\n315\n00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,980\nIf you have that happen, if you can't\nsee the information that's in there,\n\n316\n00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,420\njust drag your window as wide as you can.\n\n317\n00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,810\nThere's something about the scaling.\n\n318\n00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,918\nI think it effects certain graphics cards.\n\n319\n00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:33,970\nIt's not affecting mine here, but\nIt will make that kind of render weird and\n\n320\n00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,880\nthat'll happen.\n\n321\n00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,560\nI find it really happens if you\nhave an external monitor hooked up,\n\n322\n00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,100\nit almost always happens there.\n\n323\n00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,670\nSo, if you see that, just stretch\nout that window a little bit wider.\n\n324\n00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:44,780\nAll right, but looking at this,\n\n325\n00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,580\nI can see all the information that I\nneed right here, I can get all of that.\n\n326\n00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,224\nAnd we're going to come back\nto this software one later,\n\n327\n00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:53,102\nbecause there's some great data\nin here about our software.\n\n328\n00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:55,939\nNot just the version that we're running,\nalthough that is here but\n\n329\n00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:58,545\ninformation about the applications\nthat we've installed.\n\n330\n00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:01,411\nBecause you may have installed\na lot of third party applications.\n\n331\n00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:05,613\nThen we've got to be aware of how\nthose are going to affect our upgrade.\n\n332\n00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:09,456\nAll right, so those are some of the places\nthat we can go to get that information and\n\n333\n00:16:09,456 --> 00:16:12,450\nfind out whether or\nnot we can run Yosemite.\n\n334\n00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,190\nIn my case I can run it,\nso I want to do it.\n\n335\n00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,362\nI wanna go ahead and upgrade.\n\n336\n00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:19,050\nI wanna get that loaded on my system,\nall right?\n\n337\n00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:23,330\nWell, Apple has four\nthings that they recommend\n\n338\n00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,570\neverybody do prior to an upgrade.\n\n339\n00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,690\nSo if Yosemite came out and\nyou're ready to pull the trigger,\n\n340\n00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,270\nyou're ready to install it, there's\nfour things they want you to do first.\n\n341\n00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,690\nThey are pretty important.\n\n342\n00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,660\nThe first one is check for updates.\n\n343\n00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,710\nMake sure that your current\noperating system is up to date\n\n344\n00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,620\nbecause what'll happen is,\nlet's say you're running Mavericks.\n\n345\n00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,840\nWhen they created Yosemite, they said all\nright we need to import some features from\n\n346\n00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,810\nMavericks and there's some features that\njust aren't coming over quite right.\n\n347\n00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,820\nAnd maybe if we make\na change to Maverick's and\n\n348\n00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,650\nfix it, then it'll come\nover on Yosemite just fine.\n\n349\n00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:01,790\nSo they pushed out an update to Mavericks\nthat fixes the upgrade problem.\n\n350\n00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,000\nIf you don't have that update,\nthen your upgrade will have problems.\n\n351\n00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,950\nIf you do that with the update,\nyour upgrade will go fine.\n\n352\n00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,610\nSo you just do your updates.\n\n353\n00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,000\nWell, it's super easy on a Mac.\n\n354\n00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,640\nAll we have to do,\n\n355\n00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,500\nhere I'll do it on mine cuz I can't\nremember the last time I did my updates,\n\n356\n00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,330\nyou just go to your Apple menu up top and\nyou go to your system preferences.\n\n357\n00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,690\nAnd inside of system preferences, there’s\na few ways to do this that are easier, but\n\n358\n00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,470\nbasically we wanna go into our app store,\nand\n\n359\n00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,430\nin our app store you’ve got\nthe Check Now for updates.\n\n360\n00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,526\nSo I can see the last time\nmine was checked was today, so\n\n361\n00:17:34,526 --> 00:17:38,000\nI’ve actually checked recently, but\nyou can go in here and hit Check Now.\n\n362\n00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,820\nNow if you’re running an older OS,\nthe updates might not be fully\n\n363\n00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,750\nintegrated into the app store yet, and\non those you go to your Apple menu, and\n\n364\n00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,570\nyou'll actually see a system update\nlink right here under the menu, and\n\n365\n00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,880\nyou'll be able to choose that and\ndo the system update.\n\n366\n00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,110\nOn older OSs, like previous to Mavericks,\nyou go to Apple menu, and system update.\n\n367\n00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,340\nIn newer OSs,\nyou go into your system preferences, and\n\n368\n00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,200\ninto the App Store icon, and\nhit that check now, all right?\n\n369\n00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,010\nIt's gonna reach out and it's gonna check\nfor any updates that are out there.\n\n370\n00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,890\nSo mine's going out there and\nlooking for some updates,\n\n371\n00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,320\nand we'll see if it has any, all right?\n\n372\n00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,870\nNow if there are updates,\nyou need to apply them,\n\n373\n00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,930\napply all the updates that are available\nprior to doing the upgrade.\n\n374\n00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,610\nNow for the most part, every upgrade\nyou need should be right here, or\n\n375\n00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,380\nevery update.\n\n376\n00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,830\nAnd so you get the updates and\nyou're in business.\n\n377\n00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,260\nBut there are some updates\nthat may not show up in here.\n\n378\n00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:32,940\nAll right?\n\n379\n00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,470\nIn particular, firmware updates.\n\n380\n00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,280\nAnd that's the number two thing\nthat Apple wants you to do.\n\n381\n00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,370\nSo number one,\ndo your system updates like I just did.\n\n382\n00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,980\nNumber two, do your firmware updates.\n\n383\n00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,250\nNow, firmware updates\nare a little bit more difficult.\n\n384\n00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:47,850\nRight?\n\n385\n00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,940\nWith firmware updates, when you\nbought your laptop or your desktop,\n\n386\n00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,800\nApple has already applied the firmware\nupdates up to the point of purchase.\n\n387\n00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,110\nSo you should be good for\nanything up to that point.\n\n388\n00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:03,060\nBut anything that's come out since\nthen you may need to manually apply.\n\n389\n00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,880\nSo we need to go and\n\n390\n00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,150\ncheck Apple's website to see if\nthere's been any firmware updates.\n\n391\n00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:07,710\nRight?\n\n392\n00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,570\nIf we wanna do that,\nwe need to go to Apple's website.\n\n393\n00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,280\nWhoop, which is not there.\n\n394\n00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,430\nWe need to go to, where did I\nput Apple's website, here we go.\n\n395\n00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,630\nWe need to go to Apple's website and\nwe need to go to their download section.\n\n396\n00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,930\nThe URL is support.apple.com/downloads.\n\n397\n00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,811\nWhen you go into your downloads section,\nit's gonna show you downloads for\n\n398\n00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:31,270\nevery apple product.\n\n399\n00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:36,330\nIt's a ton of stuff and so you'll see\nI've got some time server update for\n\n400\n00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,980\nMountain Lion and\nthere's some Maverick updates.\n\n401\n00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,630\nSo there's a lot of different\nthings that'll be thrown in here\n\n402\n00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,230\nthat don't necessary pertain\nto what you're doing.\n\n403\n00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,700\nI'm looking for\nfirmware updates for my laptop.\n\n404\n00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,390\nSo I'm going to go up here\nto browse my product,\n\n405\n00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,270\nand I'm gonna tell it what I've got.\n\n406\n00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,270\nYou'll see up here we've got\nMac notebooks, Mac desktops,\n\n407\n00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,100\nyou've got Quicktime, Safari,\niPhone, all those other ones.\n\n408\n00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,290\nI've got a Mac notebook,\nso I'll choose that.\n\n409\n00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,110\nAnd now it's gonna display some of\nthe updates that area available for\n\n410\n00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,770\nMac notebooks.\n\n411\n00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:09,140\nNow these are for\nall of the Mac notebooks.\n\n412\n00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,250\nSo these might include some that\naren't mine, like these Macbook Airs.\n\n413\n00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,100\nWell, I've got a Macbook Pro.\n\n414\n00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,620\nThat's not what I need.\n\n415\n00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,200\nSo you can go through and browse this way.\n\n416\n00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,450\nBut it's kind of annoying.\n\n417\n00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,550\nSo you'll usually wanna go ahead and\ndo a search.\n\n418\n00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,550\nAnd what I like to do is I like to\ntake the friendly name of my system.\n\n419\n00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:29,110\nSo I'm just gonna go to About this Mac,\nand I'll copy my friendly name and\n\n420\n00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,220\nthat's what I usually search with.\n\n421\n00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,710\nAnd so, if I go back here and\npunch into search downloads,\n\n422\n00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,570\nI'll just paste that,\nbecause with each download,\n\n423\n00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,600\nit will list the affected systems and\nthis is what it will list for your system.\n\n424\n00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,890\nSo when I do a search here, now it's\nsearching for my laptop specifically.\n\n425\n00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,660\nAnd the only updates I should\nsee should pertain to my laptop.\n\n426\n00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,410\nNow there's three main types of\nupdates that I'm looking for.\n\n427\n00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,910\nThe main one is called a software update.\n\n428\n00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,720\nAnd so I can see right here,\nMacbook Pro Retina, 13 inch,\n\n429\n00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,599\nlate 2013 software update 1.0.\n\n430\n00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,330\nNow 1.0 is a pretty low number.\n\n431\n00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,260\nSo my laptop likely\nshipped with this already.\n\n432\n00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,923\nBut if I saw a 1.1 or a 1.2 or\na 2.0, I'd probably need that.\n\n433\n00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:12,830\nWell you can click on it and it will take\nyou in to get some information on it and\n\n434\n00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,067\nI can see the post date.\n\n435\n00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:19,620\nThis was posted October 22, 2013, and\nI know I got my laptop in May of 2014,\n\n436\n00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,940\nso I should have that update,\nI should be in good shape there.\n\n437\n00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,570\nIf you're unsure you can always go and\nreinstall it.\n\n438\n00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,420\nIt doesn't hurt to install it a second\ntime it just takes a little bit\n\n439\n00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,250\nof time right?\n\n440\n00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,410\nSo never hesitate to go and\nreinstall them.\n\n441\n00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,650\nNow that's one type of update the other\ntwo updates that you'll see are,\n\n442\n00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,020\nlet me see if I can find them, EFI and\nSMC and there we go I've got both of mine.\n\n443\n00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,830\nSo here's my\nMacBook Pro Retina EFI update.\n\n444\n00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,500\nThat is your,\nEFI is like a replacement for BIOS.\n\n445\n00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,780\nWe used to have BIOS that would boot your\nsystem up in the very beginning, and\n\n446\n00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,780\nnow we have this enhanced firmware image,\nthis EFI stuff.\n\n447\n00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,370\nAnd what it does is give you\na lot of new features and\n\n448\n00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,470\nsecurity at the boot loader level.\n\n449\n00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,325\nSo there is an EFI update.\n\n450\n00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:05,401\nSo version 1.1.\n\n451\n00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:06,180\nAll right.\n\n452\n00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,910\nSo I should download and apply that.\n\n453\n00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,890\nAnd then I've got my Macbook Pro SMC,\nwhich is a micro controller update.\n\n454\n00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,420\nAnd that's basically like a firmware for\nthe motherboard.\n\n455\n00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,770\nAnd so when we talk about firmware that's\ntypically the actual one that we want.\n\n456\n00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,319\nAnd so I can see a Macbook Pro Retina SMC\nupdate version 1.2.\n\n457\n00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,435\nI should get that and\nactually now that I look at it,\n\n458\n00:22:28,435 --> 00:22:33,480\nthis up here is my EFI update version 1.1,\nhere's EFI update version 1.2.\n\n459\n00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,050\nSo, I need to make sure I\nactually apply the newest one,\n\n460\n00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,850\nthat 1.2 right there would be\nnewer than the other ones.\n\n461\n00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,140\nBe careful about that if\nthere's been more than one.\n\n462\n00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,600\nBut those are the three things\nthat you're looking for.\n\n463\n00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,460\nThe software update,\nthe EFI update, and the SMC update.\n\n464\n00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,091\nThose three things apply them to get your\nsystem all the way up to date before doing\n\n465\n00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:53,851\nan upgrade.\n\n466\n00:22:55,313 --> 00:22:56,116\nAll right.\n\n467\n00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:59,300\nNow that's two of the things\nApple wants to do.\n\n468\n00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,380\nSoftware updates and firmware updates.\n\n469\n00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,700\nWhat are the other two?\n\n470\n00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,130\nWell the other two are somewhat optional.\n\n471\n00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,442\nThey based on around backing up.\n\n472\n00:23:08,442 --> 00:23:13,100\nYou wanna make sure that if something\ngoes wrong during the upgrade,\n\n473\n00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,440\nyou don't lose data.\n\n474\n00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,400\nThings can go wrong.\n\n475\n00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,670\nThey don't go wrong often.\n\n476\n00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,370\nBut they do, sometimes.\n\n477\n00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:23,220\nAnd when it happens you might have to\nerase your computer and do a fresh and\n\n478\n00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,060\nclean install.\n\n479\n00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,890\nOr maybe you didn't intend to\ndo a fresh and clean install.\n\n480\n00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,610\nYou didn't intend to do a format,\nbut it did it by accident.\n\n481\n00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,960\nLike you've re-partitioned.\n\n482\n00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,930\nWell, those are things that\ncan happen by accident.\n\n483\n00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,500\nYou can lose your data, it's really bad.\n\n484\n00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,230\nSo number three on our required items.\n\n485\n00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,450\nDo a backup.\n\n486\n00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,490\nBackup all of your data.\n\n487\n00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,470\nYou can use Time Machine,\nright, built right into Mac OS.\n\n488\n00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,300\nYou can use iCloud, you can use\nany third party backup software.\n\n489\n00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,530\nYou can use CD or DVD discs.\n\n490\n00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,190\nYou can use an external drive.\n\n491\n00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,410\nBack up your data, right.\n\n492\n00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,903\nAt least your documents folder but\n\n493\n00:23:54,903 --> 00:23:57,123\ntypically your whole user\nprofile you want to get.\n\n494\n00:23:57,123 --> 00:24:00,176\nIf you're using Time Machine,\nyou've got all that.\n\n495\n00:24:00,176 --> 00:24:03,138\nSo backup your user data.\n\n496\n00:24:03,138 --> 00:24:06,178\nThe fourth one is backup settings.\n\n497\n00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:10,240\nThere are system settings or\npreferences that may be important to you.\n\n498\n00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,940\nAnd while Time Machine does back those up,\n\n499\n00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,240\nit only restores those when\nyou're doing a complete restore.\n\n500\n00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,100\nSo if I have a backup under Mavericks and\n\n501\n00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,840\nnow I'm running Yosemite,\nif those settings didn't come over I can't\n\n502\n00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,430\nbring them back from Time Machine without\nrolling back to Mavericks again, right?\n\n503\n00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,077\nAnd we don't necessarily want that.\n\n504\n00:24:28,077 --> 00:24:31,860\nSo there's not really a great way\nto bring those preferences over.\n\n505\n00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,530\nWell, we'll see in a later\nepisode when we do an upgrade,\n\n506\n00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:37,740\nthe installer is great about\ngrabbing all those preferences.\n\n507\n00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,020\nSo, the odds are they'll come over just\nfine, no problems whatever, right?\n\n508\n00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,150\nBut, if there is some preferences or some\nsystem settings that really important to\n\n509\n00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,540\nyou that you know you want, it's a good\nidea to document them, all right?\n\n510\n00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,440\nAnd I mean break out a pencil and paper or\n\n511\n00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,580\nyou can create a text document and\nwrite them down.\n\n512\n00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,000\nWrite down all those settings that you\nmodified, those things that you changed.\n\n513\n00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,800\nSo that when you do the upgrade\nif some of them didn't come over,\n\n514\n00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,030\nat least you know what they were.\n\n515\n00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:06,072\nNow you can redo them and you can put\nthose changes back in, all right?\n\n516\n00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:10,430\nSo item number 3 was backup my data.\n\n517\n00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:15,215\nItem number 4 is backup, or document\nmy settings, my preferences, right?\n\n518\n00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:17,450\nTo make sure that we're all good.\n\n519\n00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,988\nSo prior to doing an upgrade\nthose are the four items, right?\n\n520\n00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:23,520\nDo a software update of my system.\n\n521\n00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,680\nDo a firmware update of my system.\n\n522\n00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,160\nBack up my user data.\n\n523\n00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,202\nAnd back up my settings or\ndocument my settings.\n\n524\n00:25:31,202 --> 00:25:34,690\nAll right, with all that in mind,\nwith all that done.\n\n525\n00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,948\nNow, we're ready to go ahead and move\nforward and start to do an upgrade, right?\n\n526\n00:25:36,948 --> 00:25:38,770\nOr get that in place.\n\n527\n00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,790\nSo, now, we're ready to move\ninto that next step, all right.\n\n528\n00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:45,150\nBut, looking at the clock, I'm a little\nshort on time on this segment,\n\n529\n00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,730\nso let's stop here and take a break.\n\n530\n00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,210\nAnd when we get back,\n\n531\n00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:52,270\nwe're gonna jump into getting ready\nto do the actual install or upgrades.\n\n532\n00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,655\nSo, stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n533\n00:25:53,655 --> 00:25:57,300\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n534\n00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:02,647\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n535\n00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:05,599\nSo, now we've determined\nthat our laptop or\n\n536\n00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,560\ndesktop is ready to be\nupgraded to Yosemite.\n\n537\n00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,090\nWe've met all of the minimum requirements,\nwe've done our four recommended steps,\n\n538\n00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,250\nwe're ready to go.\n\n539\n00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,527\nThe next thing we need to do, is to\nsecure the installation media, right?\n\n540\n00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:18,819\nWe need to to get a copy of Yosemite.\n\n541\n00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:21,044\nIf you buy a new Apple laptop or desktop,\n\n542\n00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:24,656\nit's gonna come with Yosemite\nalready installed on it, right?\n\n543\n00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:26,148\nSo, problem solved, done.\n\n544\n00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:27,083\nRight, shortest episode ever.\n\n545\n00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:32,220\nBut if you're upgrading,\nyou need to get a copy of Yosemite.\n\n546\n00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,881\nApple no longer distributes their\noperating systems on DVDs like they used\n\n547\n00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:38,320\nto, mostly because the OS\njust got too large, but\n\n548\n00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,370\nalso because they really don't need to.\n\n549\n00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,199\nNow that they have the Apple or\nthe Mac App Store,\n\n550\n00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:48,090\nyou can just go right in there, and you\ncan download Yosemite as a free upgrade.\n\n551\n00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,340\nIt's free, they don't charge any extra for\nit, and you can do the upgrade.\n\n552\n00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,380\nThe problem is you might not be upgrading\nthe machine where you download Yosemite.\n\n553\n00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,570\nIf you need to upgrade 10 machines you\ndon't necessarily want to go to all 10 and\n\n554\n00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,130\ndo those upgrades separately,\nhaving them all download a full copy.\n\n555\n00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,810\nSo you might wanna make your own\nexternal installation media.\n\n556\n00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,060\nAnd this is a pretty common thing for\nbusinesses.\n\n557\n00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,730\nIf you're a home user and\nyou have two or three devices, yeah,\n\n558\n00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,560\nyou just go into the App Store and\ndo the update and you're done.\n\n559\n00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,406\nBut if you are in a business environment,\nif you have a lot of computers that you\n\n560\n00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:23,204\nare working with,\nyou will probably do something like,\n\n561\n00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:26,980\ngrab a little USB thumb drive and\nput the Yosemite installer on here.\n\n562\n00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,406\nThen, you can go to any Mac, boot off\nthis installer; and install Yosemite and\n\n563\n00:27:31,406 --> 00:27:32,080\noff you go.\n\n564\n00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,039\nYou do your upgrade and so on.\n\n565\n00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,760\nSo, pretty hand to have\nphysical installation media.\n\n566\n00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,188\nBut Apple requires you\nto make it yourself.\n\n567\n00:27:39,188 --> 00:27:42,942\nAll right, well, let's take a look\nat the automatic way first for\n\n568\n00:27:42,942 --> 00:27:44,490\ngetting the installation media and\n\n569\n00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,622\nthen we'll take a look at building\nthis USB key and getting it ready.\n\n570\n00:27:48,622 --> 00:27:51,010\nAll right,\nnow I mentioned that the installer itself,\n\n571\n00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,710\nwe can just get that right\nfrom the Mac App store.\n\n572\n00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,360\nSo let me show you that here,\nI'll take my laptop and\n\n573\n00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,210\nI'm gonna fire up my App Store\nwhich I'm sure I can get into here.\n\n574\n00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,390\nThere we go.\n\n575\n00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,260\nAnd when you go into the app store if you\ndon't have Yosemite installed already it\n\n576\n00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,150\nwill probably be recommended\nright here in the main homepage.\n\n577\n00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,300\nUsually it pops up right\nthere towards the top.\n\n578\n00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,360\nBut if it doesn't you can just\ndo a quick search for Yosemite.\n\n579\n00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,360\nAnd it should turn up right\nthere towards the top.\n\n580\n00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,200\nOkay.\n\n581\n00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,080\nNow, if you're running Mavericks or\none of the older OSs, and you've never\n\n582\n00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,095\ndownloaded Yosemite before, then you'll\nsee a little button here, that'll say get.\n\n583\n00:28:28,095 --> 00:28:29,530\nThat you can get it, right.\n\n584\n00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,440\nIt's a free download.\n\n585\n00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,135\nSo they say get.\n\n586\n00:28:31,135 --> 00:28:33,620\nAnd you can download and have it, right?\n\n587\n00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,088\nIf you've already downloaded it\non at least one other computer,\n\n588\n00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:40,470\nthen it's gonna change, and it's gonna\nsay download, instead, all right?\n\n589\n00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,465\nSo either way,\nwhether it says get or download,\n\n590\n00:28:42,465 --> 00:28:44,762\nit's really gonna do the same basic thing,\nall right.\n\n591\n00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:48,500\nNow, when you hit get,\nit will then change to say Install.\n\n592\n00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,486\nAnd you can go ahead and\nhit install and it's gonna do that.\n\n593\n00:28:50,486 --> 00:28:56,550\nWell, the idea is, for a home user, they\nwanna install it right here on their Mac.\n\n594\n00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,492\nRight on the Mac that they are on\nright now, but in a business,\n\n595\n00:28:59,492 --> 00:29:02,110\nI'm trying to get ready to\ninstall this on other Macs.\n\n596\n00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,495\nSo I need to make an installation media.\n\n597\n00:29:03,495 --> 00:29:06,630\nWell, if I've already downloaded this on\nanother Mac, I can go to that Mac and\n\n598\n00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,116\nmake the installation media there.\n\n599\n00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:13,450\nBut if I want it local, I can go ahead and\nhit that download or install.\n\n600\n00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,770\nNow quick word of advice.\n\n601\n00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:18,510\nIf it does say install,\nwhen you hit install, it's gonna try and\n\n602\n00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,980\ninstall it right here on this Mac.\n\n603\n00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,530\nAnd like me, I've already got it.\n\n604\n00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,400\nSee how it's telling me\nI've already got it?\n\n605\n00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,900\nSo you can hit continue and\nit's gonna download it.\n\n606\n00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,770\nIf it launches the installer and you don't\nwant to install, you can just hit cancel.\n\n607\n00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:37,840\nAnd that will cancel the installer but\nleave the installation media behind.\n\n608\n00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,660\nAnd that's really what we want anyway.\n\n609\n00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,310\nSo if you're on a machine\nrunning Mavericks and\n\n610\n00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:44,490\nyou don't wanna upgrade it, you still\ncome in here and you hit install.\n\n611\n00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,660\nBut when that first screen comes\nup that says installing Yosemite,\n\n612\n00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,480\nyou just hit cancel.\n\n613\n00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,870\nYou just close it, right?\n\n614\n00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,240\nNow you've got the installation media but\nyou didn't do the install.\n\n615\n00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,280\nAll right,\nnow mine's starting to download and\n\n616\n00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,710\nI'm not gonna see a whole\nlot of information here.\n\n617\n00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,460\nBut it is actually downloading.\n\n618\n00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,180\nThe file that it's downloading is\ngoing into your applications folder.\n\n619\n00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:08,610\nAnd so I can browse into my applications,\nI'll go into applications over here and\n\n620\n00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:14,360\nwhat I'm looking for is an application\ncalled Install Mac OS X Yosemite.\n\n621\n00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:14,970\nAll right?\n\n622\n00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,847\nAnd I don't see it yet so\nit hasn't actually started.\n\n623\n00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:21,359\nIf you're like me then my laptop\nshipped with Mavericks and so\n\n624\n00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,782\nI had a install OS X Mavericks and\nwhen you hit this download,\n\n625\n00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:29,200\nnow you'll get an install\nOS X Yosemite also.\n\n626\n00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,240\nAnd you can keep them both.\n\n627\n00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,880\nThey're kind of big.\n\n628\n00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,150\nThey're about 6gb in size.\n\n629\n00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,266\nSo they do take up a bit of hard drive\nspace, I try not to waste space so\n\n630\n00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:38,205\nI removed mine, and many people do that.\n\n631\n00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:41,348\nSo, Because I've removed mine,\nit's gonna have to download them again,\n\n632\n00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:44,147\nwhich is what it's supposed to be\ndoing here in the background, but\n\n633\n00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:45,640\ninstead it's just sitting there.\n\n634\n00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,761\nSo, I planned for this possibility, right.\n\n635\n00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:52,420\nI got an external hard drive\nattached to my system.\n\n636\n00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,040\nI've already got this downloaded over\nthere, so I'm just gonna reach over and\n\n637\n00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,480\ngrab it from there, I save everything,\nI'm like a data pack rat.\n\n638\n00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,850\nAnd so here you can see my install\nOS X Mavericks, install OS X Yosemite.\n\n639\n00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,700\nI want Yosemite, so I'm just gonna go and\npaste that in here.\n\n640\n00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,893\nIt doesn't matter that\nit's trying to download,\n\n641\n00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:12,220\nit'll actually see that it's the same\nfile, and won't download it again.\n\n642\n00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,907\nIt'll just show it as already being\ndone whenever it sorts itself.\n\n643\n00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:21,450\nBut see how it's 5.17gb in size,\nthat's a decent bit of space, right?\n\n644\n00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,910\nSo you probably don't want to\nleave it laying around for\n\n645\n00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,160\ntoo terribly long if your hard\ndrive space is at a premium.\n\n646\n00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,590\nIf you've got a ton of hard drive space\n\n647\n00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,890\nthen it doesn't matter you\njust leave it there, right?\n\n648\n00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,560\nThat is the installer.\n\n649\n00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,920\nAnd like a lot of software that\nyou download, it's in a DMG file.\n\n650\n00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,110\nIt's an application, but\n\n651\n00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:41,270\nit's really a DMG on the back end that\nstores all of the OS X installation files.\n\n652\n00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:45,250\nAnd if you were to double click on it,\nit starts the installation.\n\n653\n00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,310\nIt starts to install\nYosemite on this machine.\n\n654\n00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,260\nAnd if that's what you want, you're ready.\n\n655\n00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,600\nIt's downloaded,\nyou're ready for the install.\n\n656\n00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,227\nOkay.\n\n657\n00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:55,627\nBut if you're not\ninstalling on this machine,\n\n658\n00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:59,475\nif you're installing on some other\nmachine, we need to not do the install.\n\n659\n00:31:59,475 --> 00:32:02,435\nAnd instead create an installation media.\n\n660\n00:32:02,435 --> 00:32:06,293\nAnd that process is a little unintuitive,\nso I wanna show that to you guys here,\n\n661\n00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:06,880\nall right.\n\n662\n00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,670\nSo now I've got my install OSX UsME.\n\n663\n00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,510\nOne other thing I do wanna mention.\n\n664\n00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,870\nI've had problems with the download,\n\n665\n00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,260\nwhich actually you guys can\nsee I'm having right now.\n\n666\n00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,130\nI'm on a 40 megabit\nfiber-optic connection here.\n\n667\n00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,060\nWe're on a Metro-E connection.\n\n668\n00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,140\nSo I've got a great internet connection.\n\n669\n00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,642\nAnd if this thing would\never start downloading,\n\n670\n00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:25,390\nit will actually download really, fast.\n\n671\n00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,800\nBut it hasn't started.\n\n672\n00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,850\nThat happens.\n\n673\n00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:32,010\nSo sometimes what you have to do is\nbasically cancel out of the app store and\n\n674\n00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,730\ngo in and repeat the process.\n\n675\n00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,390\nSometimes you have to log\nout of the app store and\n\n676\n00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:38,100\nlog back in before it gets happy and\ndoes the download.\n\n677\n00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,450\nThe other problem I've had a lot of\ntimes where the download interrupts,\n\n678\n00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,633\nwhere it will get 10% done and\nstop, right.\n\n679\n00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,650\nIf that happens, clicking download here\nagain a lot of the times will start\n\n680\n00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,650\nit over from the beginning\nwhich we don't want.\n\n681\n00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:56,970\nSo if your download ever gets frozen, what\nyou can do is you can close the app store\n\n682\n00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:01,210\nan then browse in applications and you'll\nsee the partially downloaded file, and\n\n683\n00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,690\nif you double click on it it'll\nstart the download again.\n\n684\n00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,180\nBut it will resume where it left off.\n\n685\n00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,420\nSo the first time that I\ndownloaded Yosemite there were so\n\n686\n00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,340\nmany people hammering Apple servers\nthat it was really a problem.\n\n687\n00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,910\nI had to go and\ndo that maybe eight times nine times.\n\n688\n00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,850\nTo get it fully downloaded.\n\n689\n00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,150\nIt would pause and I would just come\nin here and double click on it.\n\n690\n00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,180\nAnd it would resume.\n\n691\n00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,850\nSo you may need to do that too\nto get it initially downloaded.\n\n692\n00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,560\nAnd that's why I like to\nsave a copy of these.\n\n693\n00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,760\nI don't want to be in a hurry and say,\nboy I really need that installer.\n\n694\n00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,830\nLet me go wait for\nthe download, all right.\n\n695\n00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,930\nSo better to keep a copy\nof it on hand somewhere,\n\n696\n00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,230\nand I have this removable drive\nwhere I keep it, all right.\n\n697\n00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,360\nSo now that I've got it I know\nI can double click on that and\n\n698\n00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,750\nstart the install on this machine.\n\n699\n00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:45,200\nSo I could just take that file and copy\nit to any Mac that I wanted, stick it in\n\n700\n00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,812\nthe application folder and run it and then\nthat would start the install there too.\n\n701\n00:33:48,812 --> 00:33:51,000\nAll right, so\nthat's one way of doing the install right,\n\n702\n00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,410\nespecially with an upgrade\nthat works really well.\n\n703\n00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:56,280\nBut, what if I wanted to do a fresh and\nclean install,\n\n704\n00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,980\nI want to format the whole system.\n\n705\n00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,280\nI don't want to rely on\nwhatever OS is on there.\n\n706\n00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,570\nwell I can't copy this to\nthe applications folder and\n\n707\n00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,390\nrun it that way if I wanna do a fresh and\nclean install.\n\n708\n00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,350\nSo I really need to create\na USB installation media.\n\n709\n00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,840\nSomething like this thumb drive,\nall right.\n\n710\n00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,548\nSo let's see the process for that.\n\n711\n00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:13,820\nBasically, I'm gonna\ntake this thumb drive,\n\n712\n00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,520\nI'm gonna stick it on the computer here,\nand I got this from our producer, right,\n\n713\n00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,030\nbefore the show so\nI really have no idea what's on it and\n\n714\n00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:27,050\nI wanna just plug that in here and it'll\ndetect, there it is right there, JUMPER.\n\n715\n00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,380\nSo that's that USB drive and\nit's always best to go ahead and\n\n716\n00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,630\nformat the drive before you create\nan installation media on it, right.\n\n717\n00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,510\nThis came from Nate and\nNate uses a Windows machine over there.\n\n718\n00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:42,220\nSo it's probably formatted\nNTFS Which a Mac can read but\n\n719\n00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,890\nit can't write to by default.\n\n720\n00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:46,500\nSo it's not going to help me\nmuch to have an NTSF anyway.\n\n721\n00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,600\nSo I'm going to format it to\nmake it the Apple file system.\n\n722\n00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,480\nSo I'm just gonna get\ninto my disk utility.\n\n723\n00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:58,030\nWhich we could go into our applications\nfolder and into the utilities folder.\n\n724\n00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,520\nYou'll find the disk utility in there.\n\n725\n00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,090\nI just use spotlight to\npull it up real quick.\n\n726\n00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,260\nI'll go into my disk utility.\n\n727\n00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,720\nThere's jumper.\n\n728\n00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,780\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm gonna\nchoose the USB drive itself.\n\n729\n00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,720\nWe need to format it.\n\n730\n00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,025\nAnd to make things work properly,\n\n731\n00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:16,190\nwe need to format it as a single\npartition and make it HFS plus.\n\n732\n00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:20,960\nThe journal file system that\nApple created for Mac OS.\n\n733\n00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,870\nYou can do different partition schemes and\nso on.\n\n734\n00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,990\nBut if you want it to be nice and\nsmooth, things work the right way.\n\n735\n00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,218\nThen I encourage you to do one partition,\nformatted HFS.\n\n736\n00:35:30,218 --> 00:35:35,740\nSo I'm gonna go over here to the Partition\nside, and I can see sure enough, there's\n\n737\n00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,560\nthat one partition and it is NTFS, so\nI'm gonna have to repetition this thing.\n\n738\n00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,120\nI'm just going to choose one partition,\nand it's calling it untitled one,\n\n739\n00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,130\nI'm just gonna call this thumb drive or\nsomething.\n\n740\n00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,950\nIt's gonna make me go all capital\nbecause it's set to Microsoft FAT.\n\n741\n00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:56,390\nLet me change that to\nMac OS extended journal and\n\n742\n00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,110\nnow I can call it my thumb drive.\n\n743\n00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,810\nJust so I can remember what that is,\nright, or USB drive, or\n\n744\n00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,660\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n745\n00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,080\nI'm gonna call mine thumb drive,\nall right?\n\n746\n00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,090\nOne partition MAC OS extended,\nthat's that HFS file system and\n\n747\n00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,880\nit's a 32 gig drive, plenty of space.\n\n748\n00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,520\nThe install file you guys saw a moment\nago was 5.17 gigabytes in size and\n\n749\n00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,140\nApple says that the installation media\nneeds to really be about 8 gigs in size.\n\n750\n00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,630\nAnd that's because some of the contents\nare gonna get decompressed.\n\n751\n00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,920\nSo it will get larger.\n\n752\n00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,480\nAnd you can't really find a 5 gig\nUSB installation media anyway.\n\n753\n00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,490\nThey normally jump from 4 to 8 gigs.\n\n754\n00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,470\nSo 8 gigs is what you need to look for.\n\n755\n00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,590\nNow, I'm doing this on a thumb drive.\n\n756\n00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,620\nYou could do this on\nan external hard drive too.\n\n757\n00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,830\nI've got a Thunderbolt hard drive right\nhere that I'm using for my other storage.\n\n758\n00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,560\nI could use that, I just don't wanna\nlose the other data I have on there, so\n\n759\n00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,640\nI'll use this thumb drive instead.\n\n760\n00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,060\nI'll go ahead and hit apply and\nthat's gonna format,\n\n761\n00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,110\nit's warning me I'm gonna lose all\nmy data but I'm okay with that.\n\n762\n00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,120\nThere we go.\n\n763\n00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,260\nAnd now it's going to be ready, all right.\n\n764\n00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,730\nThe next thing is I need to get\nthe Yosemite installer on there and\n\n765\n00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,760\nunfortunately it's not as easy as\ndragging and dropping that file.\n\n766\n00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,880\nIf I'm not going to boot off the disk,\n\n767\n00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,050\nif I just wanna take\nthis to another computer.\n\n768\n00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:10,430\nAnd run the installation from there,\nright, not booting off of the thumb drive.\n\n769\n00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,690\nThen yeah, I can drag and\ndrop it on there and off I go, right.\n\n770\n00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,580\nBut if I wanna boot from the USB drive,\n\n771\n00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,540\nthere's actually a little script\nthat I have to run, right.\n\n772\n00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,470\nSo let me show you guys that\nnow that this is prepared.\n\n773\n00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,670\nBefore we run the script there's\ntwo things that we need to know.\n\n774\n00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,210\nWhen need to know where our\nYosemite installer is and\n\n775\n00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,990\nwhere our thumb drive got mounted to.\n\n776\n00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,640\nAll right.\n\n777\n00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,940\nSo let me show you how to find those out.\n\n778\n00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,440\nI'm going to bring up my terminal.\n\n779\n00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,370\nAll right.\n\n780\n00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,200\nSo here I am in my terminal.\n\n781\n00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,380\nAnd I'm just gonna take\na look at two things.\n\n782\n00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,750\nFirst I want to find my installer.\n\n783\n00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,000\nNow, the installer,\nyou can browse and find it, right.\n\n784\n00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,110\nIt should be in your applications folder.\n\n785\n00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:51,460\nAnd so I'm just going to do a quick ls\nof the applications folder I'm gonna\n\n786\n00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,740\npull up a list and\nI'm gonna look for install star,\n\n787\n00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:59,460\nanything that starts with the word install\nand I can see that it's not there.\n\n788\n00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:06,930\nIs odd, I'm gonna go to the GUI and\njust verify that I didn't screw that up.\n\n789\n00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:11,070\nSo it should be called install OS X or\nOS10 Yosemite.\n\n790\n00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,650\nIn my applications folder.\n\n791\n00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,860\nThat was odd that that didn't show up.\n\n792\n00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,470\nLet me try that again.\n\n793\n00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:18,120\nAlright so\nwe're just going to look through here and\n\n794\n00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,930\nsee if we can't find it this way.\n\n795\n00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:21,680\nYeah there it is.\n\n796\n00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,390\nFor some reason it didn't like\nmy little wild card there but\n\n797\n00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,580\nI can see it right here.\n\n798\n00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,290\nInstall OSX Yosemite.app.\n\n799\n00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,760\nNow, that's the reason I wanted\nto pull it up from the terminal.\n\n800\n00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,520\nIs that .app bit right there.\n\n801\n00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,130\nWhen we see an application,\n\n802\n00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:37,970\nthere's actually a file extension\nattached to it that we don't see.\n\n803\n00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,270\nOur graphical user\ninterface hides it from us.\n\n804\n00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,760\nThe name is a little bit different than\nwhat we see in the GUI in the finder.\n\n805\n00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,040\nSo here I can see install\nOS X Yosemite.app.\n\n806\n00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,980\nAll right, and it's right there\nin my applications folder.\n\n807\n00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,810\nThe other thing I need to know\nis where my thumb drive went.\n\n808\n00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,450\nWhen you plug a thumb drive in,\n\n809\n00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,830\nit's normally gonna mount\ninside of the volumes folder.\n\n810\n00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,580\nAnd so if we pull up a directory inside of\nthere I can see right here, thumbdrive.\n\n811\n00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,830\nThat's what I called\nthe name of that drive.\n\n812\n00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:07,920\nSo it's mounted it \\volumes\\thumbdrive,\nall right.\n\n813\n00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,990\nThose are the two pieces of information I\nneed and now I can create the installment.\n\n814\n00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,560\nNow the command I'm gonna\nrun is a really long one so\n\n815\n00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,050\nlet me move my terminal around.\n\n816\n00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,300\nThe command's actually\nreally not that bad at all.\n\n817\n00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:24,420\nIt's just the paths that I'm gonna\nhave to put in there will make it look\n\n818\n00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,470\nlong, ll right.\n\n819\n00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:28,660\nThe way the command works is like this.\n\n820\n00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,190\nI need to run it as an administrator,\nso I'm gonna start by saying sudo.\n\n821\n00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,810\nNormally when you run\na command it runs as you.\n\n822\n00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:39,980\nSo if I'm Don Pezet, right, so\nif I do a who am I I'm D Pezet,\n\n823\n00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,350\nand if I run a command\nit's gonna run as me.\n\n824\n00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:47,770\nBut if I wanna run it as an administrator,\nI need to use the super user do command.\n\n825\n00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,850\nSudo.\n\n826\n00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:52,070\nAnd so when I say sudo it's gonna run\nsomething a little more advanced.\n\n827\n00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,997\nLike, if I run ls, that's running as me.\n\n828\n00:39:54,997 --> 00:39:58,979\nIf I run sudo ls,\nit's running as an administrator.\n\n829\n00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,976\nAnd see how it's prompting me for\na password?\n\n830\n00:40:00,976 --> 00:40:04,401\nIt wants my administrative password for\nthe system.\n\n831\n00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:05,282\nAnd now it's running it.\n\n832\n00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:07,525\nAnd see how it even laid it\nout a little bit differently?\n\n833\n00:40:07,525 --> 00:40:09,910\nBecause it's now running\nas that administrator.\n\n834\n00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,510\nAll right.\n\n835\n00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,170\nSo interesting little command there.\n\n836\n00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,605\nSo to create this installer, I need to do.\n\n837\n00:40:13,605 --> 00:40:15,865\nDo that.\nSo I'm going to do pseudo and\n\n838\n00:40:15,865 --> 00:40:18,595\nthen I need to point to the app, right?\n\n839\n00:40:18,595 --> 00:40:23,785\nTo the Mac Installer and\na script inside of that app, right?\n\n840\n00:40:23,785 --> 00:40:29,333\nSo I'm basically pointing\nto a script first, right?\n\n841\n00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:34,295\nThen I'm going to tell it the volume\nI'm installing to, right?\n\n842\n00:40:34,295 --> 00:40:36,725\nMy USB drive, okay?\n\n843\n00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:41,460\nAnd then lastly,\nI'm going to tell it an action to perform.\n\n844\n00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,090\nCreate my installation right?\n\n845\n00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,660\nThose are the three things\nI'm going to provide.\n\n846\n00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,870\nThe command is made up of\nbasically four pieces.\n\n847\n00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,860\nBut when I write it out, it's going to\nbe really long because of the path.\n\n848\n00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,720\nLet's see the full layout here.\n\n849\n00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,740\nFirst off,\nI need to point to the script, and\n\n850\n00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,350\nthe script is actually\ninside of the installer.\n\n851\n00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,940\nSo I'm going to say pseudo and then I'm\ngoing to point to that installer, and\n\n852\n00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,170\nyou can use the tab auto complete to\nmake this a little bit easier, so\n\n853\n00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,990\nyou don't have to type it all the way out.\n\n854\n00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,580\nThe other thing is,\nthere's spaces in the file name, and\n\n855\n00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,270\nnotice how it puts a backslash\nbefore every space?\n\n856\n00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:18,770\nThat's called escaping the character so\nthat it knows that's all one file name,\n\n857\n00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,230\nand if you do tab auto complete,\nit will do that for you.\n\n858\n00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,840\nSo, again making life a little easier.\n\n859\n00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,650\nNow inside of that, I'm looking for\nthe contents folder.\n\n860\n00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,250\nAnd then the resources folder.\n\n861\n00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:36,410\nAnd it's inside of there that there's\na script called create install media.\n\n862\n00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,740\nThat's the script that I want to run.\n\n863\n00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:44,850\nThe script requires to\nknow where to install to.\n\n864\n00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:49,090\nSo I'm going to have to tell it dash,\ndash, volume.\n\n865\n00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,310\nThough notice there's two dashes there.\n\n866\n00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,810\nI guess it's kind of\nhard to see on my screen.\n\n867\n00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,000\nLet me resize that a little bit.\n\n868\n00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,450\nThere we go.\nSo you can see dash, dash, volume.\n\n869\n00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,670\nAnd then the name of the volume.\n\n870\n00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:06,350\nNow, mine was mounted to slash\nvolumes slash thumb drive.\n\n871\n00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,820\nAll right?\nSo I'm telling it the volume I want to\n\n872\n00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:13,226\ninstall to, and\nthen I need to tell it what to do.\n\n873\n00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:16,400\nAnd what to do is to put\nthe Yosemite installer\n\n874\n00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,610\non there as an installable media.\n\n875\n00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,960\nAnd so I need to say dash,\n\n876\n00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,030\ndash \"applicationpath\" and\npoint it to the installer.\n\n877\n00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,570\nNow the installer is the same\nas what was up here.\n\n878\n00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:32,550\nI can actually just copy and paste,\nbut I'm going to stop with \".app\".\n\n879\n00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,510\nI don't need any more than that.\n\n880\n00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:39,260\nI'm pointing to the installer itself,\nnot the script inside of it.\n\n881\n00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,400\nAll right?\n\n882\n00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,250\nAnd I can stop there but it's going to\ngive me some prompts on the screen and\n\n883\n00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,130\na lot of data I don't\nnecessarily want to see.\n\n884\n00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,560\nSo I'm going to add one more thing to it,\nwhich is dash dash no interaction, right?\n\n885\n00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,370\nI don't want any questions, just do it.\n\n886\n00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,400\nMake the installation media.\n\n887\n00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,300\nThe questions really don't\nhave any answers anyway,\n\n888\n00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,090\nyou just hit enter on them.\n\n889\n00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:00,340\nSo I'll do no interaction and\nit's going to create them.\n\n890\n00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,840\nSo really long command.\n\n891\n00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,350\nAnd I'll put this in the show notes, so\n\n892\n00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,620\ndon't feel like you got to\nscribble this all down right now.\n\n893\n00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,300\nBut that's basically it.\n\n894\n00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,300\nAnd what it's going to do is just\ngrab that installation media and\n\n895\n00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:15,990\nit's going to create a bootable partition\non that USB drive with Yosemite and\n\n896\n00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,910\nthe Yosemite installer on there.\n\n897\n00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,710\nAnd we can do recoveries and\ninstallations from that USB key.\n\n898\n00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:25,402\nAnd that is super handy, because if\nyou're replacing the hard drive in a Mac,\n\n899\n00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,980\nif your hard drive go bad,\nthere's no OS on there to boot up off of.\n\n900\n00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,430\nYou've got to boot up\noff of something else.\n\n901\n00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,440\nAnd we can use this USB media for that.\n\n902\n00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,140\nAll right now I ran a pseudo command a\nminute ago, so it's probably not going to\n\n903\n00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,980\nask me for my password again unless I talk\ntoo long, but if this is the first one\n\n904\n00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,350\nyou've run it will ask for that\npassword and you'll have to provide it.\n\n905\n00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:46,570\nAnd it looks like I got an error.\n\n906\n00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,670\nWhat's my error here?\n\n907\n00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:53,490\nIt's telling me that I've got my syntax\nwrong so I must have a typo in here.\n\n908\n00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,490\nLet me see if I can spot my typo.\n\n909\n00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,650\nUnfortunately the longer a command,\nthe more likely you'll have a typo.\n\n910\n00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:03,180\nI know for all my paths, that I use\ntab autocomplete so I should be safe.\n\n911\n00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,640\nIt gives you the usage here and so\nI can just kind of look here and\n\n912\n00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,320\nsee where my mistake is.\n\n913\n00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,350\nSo here's the script, create install\nmedia, that's what I called.\n\n914\n00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,110\nAnd it's telling me I need\nto provide --volume and\n\n915\n00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,695\nthe path of the volume to convert,\nand I did that.\n\n916\n00:44:17,695 --> 00:44:20,909\n--volume, and\nI pointed to /volume/thumbdrive.\n\n917\n00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:26,220\nThen we've got --applicationpath, and\nthat's pointing to the Yosemite installer.\n\n918\n00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,830\nAnd sure enough, I did that.\n\n919\n00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,220\nAnd actually, it looks like my\nnointeraction tag is not supported.\n\n920\n00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,385\nNo, it's right here.\n\n921\n00:44:32,385 --> 00:44:37,281\n--nointeraction, erase\nthe disk without prompting.\n\n922\n00:44:37,281 --> 00:44:40,080\nSo based on that, I don't see my mistake.\n\n923\n00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:42,170\nWhat did I do wrong here?\n\n924\n00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:44,410\nLet me just double check one more time.\n\n925\n00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:49,870\nAnd well, let me just double check\n\n926\n00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,730\non the volume, I put a trailing slash\non the volume, it might not like that.\n\n927\n00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,790\nSo let me remove that and\nsee if that's what my problem is.\n\n928\n00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,110\nWe'll go ahead and\nget rid of that and nope.\n\n929\n00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:05,682\nAll right, so it's giving me a complaint\non the arguments, so dash dash volume,\n\n930\n00:45:05,682 --> 00:45:11,090\nall right let me see if I can spot\nmy problem here, and oh Carlton in\n\n931\n00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,870\nthe chatroom, he just posted there, I've\napparently spelled application path wrong.\n\n932\n00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:15,800\nSo, let me spell that.\n\n933\n00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,230\nThank you, Carlton.\n\n934\n00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,490\nLet me go back here, and sure enough.\n\n935\n00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,660\nYeah, I'm missing a 'p' in application.\n\n936\n00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,200\nSo, there we go.\n\n937\n00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,860\nSo now, I should be good.\n\n938\n00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,780\nWe are our own worst enemy.\n\n939\n00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,080\nI was able to tab auto complete\nmost of the command and\n\n940\n00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,820\nthe little parts that I typed,\nI managed to spell wrong.\n\n941\n00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,540\nSo if we run that.\n\n942\n00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,320\nThere we go.\n\n943\n00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,030\nNow we see some action.\n\n944\n00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:37,000\nIt's erasing the USB drive.\n\n945\n00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,580\nI already erased it when I formatted it,\nbut it does it again.\n\n946\n00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,500\nSo it's erasing it, and\nnow it's laying over there.\n\n947\n00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,060\nNow, I'm using a USB 3.0 disc.\n\n948\n00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,070\nThis will happen really fast.\n\n949\n00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,990\nIf you're using a USB 2.0 It might\ntake a little while longer, right?\n\n950\n00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:55,200\n5 gigs over USB 2 can take a good ten\nminutes so you might have to wait a bit.\n\n951\n00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,180\nThis ones going to churn along.\n\n952\n00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:01,140\nNow once it's done copying, then it\nhas to, they do what's called blessing\n\n953\n00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,500\nthe partition which we'll talk\nabout in another episode.\n\n954\n00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,300\nWhere they make it bootable and\nthen I'll have a bootable USB drive\n\n955\n00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,270\nthat I can do my installs from,\nmy upgrades from, and my recoveries from.\n\n956\n00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,720\nIt's a great thing to have handy,\nstick a label on it.\n\n957\n00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,970\nAnd say Yosemite installer and\njust hang it on your desk so\n\n958\n00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:21,530\nyou remember you've got it and\nnow you're ready to go, all right?\n\n959\n00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,320\nSo, we'll let that run and\nwe'll let it complete.\n\n960\n00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,270\nAll right, so up until this point,\nlet's see what all we've talked about.\n\n961\n00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,470\nWe took a look at our system\nto find out whether or\n\n962\n00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,250\nnot it was even able to upgrade.\n\n963\n00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,480\nWas our hardware supported, right?\n\n964\n00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,650\nThen, we went through our four steps for\ndoing an upgrade, right?\n\n965\n00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:38,750\nDo you guys remember those?\n\n966\n00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,280\nWe did the software updates.\n\n967\n00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,799\nThis firmware updates and\nthen we check to back up our own data and\n\n968\n00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:48,160\nthe backup our documents,\nout system settings.\n\n969\n00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,240\nAnd then right here,\nwe took a look at the installation media.\n\n970\n00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,580\nAnd if I was installing right here on this\nsystem, I'd just go to the app store,\n\n971\n00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,930\ndownload it right there and do the\ninstall, this system would be upgraded.\n\n972\n00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:59,940\nBut if I wanted to do\nthis on other systems,\n\n973\n00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,270\nI need to create\nthe installation media here.\n\n974\n00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,860\nAnother word of advice here is\nsomething I didn't mention on this,\n\n975\n00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,600\nthat create installation\nmedia command that I'm using?\n\n976\n00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,230\nIt relies on some features, so\nwhen you look at that command,\n\n977\n00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,520\nthe script right here that I called,\n\n978\n00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:20,250\nit relies on some features that were\nintroduced in Mac OS 10.7, all right?\n\n979\n00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:25,100\nSo if you're running 10.6.8 remember\nthat you can upgrade to Yosemite 10.6.8,\n\n980\n00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,667\nbut the create install command\ndoesn't work in 10.6.8.\n\n981\n00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:33,120\nSo you have to have 10.7 or\nhigher to do that.\n\n982\n00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,520\nSo if you're trying to run this and\n\n983\n00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,370\nit's just not working, it might be\nthat you're on a 10.6.8 machine.\n\n984\n00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:39,950\nSo double check that, too.\n\n985\n00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:41,040\nBut otherwise you can create this.\n\n986\n00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,660\nAnd you can create it from any machine.\n\n987\n00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,800\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n988\n00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,430\nSo I'm creating it here on my laptop.\n\n989\n00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,924\nI can then take this installation\nmedia and go to a 10.6.8 machine and\n\n990\n00:47:48,924 --> 00:47:49,709\ndo the install.\n\n991\n00:47:49,709 --> 00:47:50,872\nIt will be just fine.\n\n992\n00:47:50,872 --> 00:47:55,492\nIt's just I can't run this script\nright here from the 10.6.8 machine.\n\n993\n00:47:55,492 --> 00:47:58,443\nNow I shouldn't have said\nthat this will scream,\n\n994\n00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:01,122\nbecause it's seeming\nto take its time here.\n\n995\n00:48:01,122 --> 00:48:04,490\nSo, normally this goes pretty fast.\n\n996\n00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,490\nMine's just kind of churning along and\nwaiting, and\n\n997\n00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,190\nI won't bore you guys to\ndeath with waiting on that.\n\n998\n00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:12,990\nOnce the installation media is done\nthough, now we're ready to go and\n\n999\n00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,340\nupgrade our other systems.\n\n1000\n00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:19,670\nBut for this episode, I wanted to tackle\nall of the things that are involved in\n\n1001\n00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,860\npreparing for the upgrade or\nthe installation.\n\n1002\n00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,820\nIn the next episode, we'll actually\ndo the upgrades and installs.\n\n1003\n00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:30,580\nRight here, that's a pretty\ngood spot to wrap up the show.\n\n1004\n00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,230\nRemember, the word application\nhas two P's in it.\n\n1005\n00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:35,920\nWord to the wise,\nI'll put that in my memory bank too.\n\n1006\n00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,860\nAnd otherwise, pretty straightforward\nprocess to get ready for an upgrade.\n\n1007\n00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:43,820\nNow, some of this seemed kind of\nredundant and common sense to you guys.\n\n1008\n00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:48,720\nWell, that's true, a lot of this is common\nsense, but it's all testable material, so\n\n1009\n00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,890\nexpect to see that\ninformation on the exam.\n\n1010\n00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,350\nActually, I stalled just long enough,\nthat it actually finished.\n\n1011\n00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:59,030\nIf we take a look at my system, you'll\nsee where it has Making disk bootable.\n\n1012\n00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:01,270\nThat's where it blessed the partition.\n\n1013\n00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:05,340\nNow, it's able to be booted and then,\nit copied the boot files and it's done.\n\n1014\n00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,700\nNow, I've got that installation media and\nit's ready to rock.\n\n1015\n00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,410\nAnd if I get out of here and\nlook at my desktop,\n\n1016\n00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:17,170\nI now have a USB drive that's called,\nInstall OS X Yosemite.\n\n1017\n00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,320\nBuilt off of that installer image.\n\n1018\n00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,760\nAnd if I go into it,\nit's got the installer.\n\n1019\n00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,560\nIt looks like we just dragged it and\ndropped it on there.\n\n1020\n00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,970\nBut it actually did a little more\nbecause it made the disk bootable.\n\n1021\n00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:29,840\nAnd that key piece that we need.\n\n1022\n00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,460\nThat's why we have that\ninstallation script.\n\n1023\n00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:37,050\nAll right, well that's a pretty\ngood spot to wrap up this show.\n\n1024\n00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,600\nRemember in the next episode,\n\n1025\n00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,200\nwe're going to take a look at\nactually installing Yosemite and\n\n1026\n00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,800\nwe'll go two different routes, we'll do\nan upgrade as well as a clean install.\n\n1027\n00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,430\nSo we'll get to see both methods\nof getting that on a system.\n\n1028\n00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:50,710\nWe'll upgrade a Mavericks System so\nwe can see bringing over our user data.\n\n1029\n00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:53,100\nIt's a pretty painless process.\n\n1030\n00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,160\nBut for this episode,\nwe'll wrap it up, keep in mind,\n\n1031\n00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,360\nif you have any questions on anything we\ncovered you are always welcome to ask.\n\n1032\n00:50:00,360 -->

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:38,870\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,711\nI'm your host,\n\n7\n00:00:39,711 --> 00:00:44,890\nDon Pezet, back again with another episode\nof Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n8\n00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,790\nToday we're going to be jumping\nright back into installation.\n\n9\n00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,030\nAnd I know in our previous episode\nit was all about getting prepared,\n\n10\n00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,290\nall the stuff you need to have in\norder to get your install running.\n\n11\n00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,320\nToday, we're actually\ngoing to do the install.\n\n12\n00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,800\nNow for most people the installation takes\na really straightforward and easy path.\n\n13\n00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,710\nIf you have a Mac it came with\nMac OS already installed.\n\n14\n00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,820\nApple does not sell hardware\nwithout Mac OS on it.\n\n15\n00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,090\nSo if you buy a PC or a laptop, or\n\n16\n00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,570\nwhatever from them,\nit's going to have Mac OS on it.\n\n17\n00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,940\nSo for most people,\nyou don't do a fresh install of Mac OS, or\n\n18\n00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,530\nYosemite, you'll do an upgrade\nto Yosemite, all right?\n\n19\n00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,375\nAnd the upgrade process is\nsuper easy let me show you.\n\n20\n00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,055\nFor most people,\n\n21\n00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,135\nthey might be on a machine like this\none that's running Mavericks, right?\n\n22\n00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:36,215\nAnd remember, to upgrade to Yosemite,\nyou've got to be on 10.6.8 or higher.\n\n23\n00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:40,605\nSo you can't be too old on your system,\nand your hardware has to be supported.\n\n24\n00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:43,985\nWell, assuming that you meet\nthose criteria, for most people,\n\n25\n00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:46,270\nthey simply go into the app store.\n\n26\n00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,470\nAnd in the app store, they'll find\nYosemite in there as an update.\n\n27\n00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,620\nNow it may show up under your updates.\n\n28\n00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,890\nI don't know if that's\nwhat's showing up here.\n\n29\n00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,530\nOh it is.\n\n30\n00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,650\nSo for me,\nit's actually showing up under my updates.\n\n31\n00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,700\nIf it doesn't, you might just\nhave to search for Yosemite and\n\n32\n00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,160\nit'll turn up right there.\n\n33\n00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,650\nAnd you can choose to do the update.\n\n34\n00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,050\nSo I've got this message\nright here in my app store,\n\n35\n00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,050\ntelling me I need to update and\nI can do it.\n\n36\n00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,830\nSo I can hit download and we go.\n\n37\n00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,480\nNow, with some updates,\nlike this software update right down here,\n\n38\n00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,490\nyou can just hit the update,\nit downloads it and applies it.\n\n39\n00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,460\nWith the Yosemite, it will download it,\nand it will launch the upgrade wizard.\n\n40\n00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,350\nThe little menu screen that you have\nto navigate through to do the upgrade.\n\n41\n00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,020\nSo it's a little different\nthan the normal one.\n\n42\n00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,420\nA normal update like the ones down here\nwe would expect to be no interaction.\n\n43\n00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,810\nThey just automatically install and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n44\n00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,110\nBut with Yosemite, it does ask some\nquestions and on the exam, they want you\n\n45\n00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,786\nto be familiar with what those questions\nare and how you need to answer them.\n\n46\n00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:47,290\nNow, I want to show you guys an upgrade\nfirst because the upgrade asks the least\n\n47\n00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,280\namount of questions and\nthen we'll go into a fresh install and\n\n48\n00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,550\nsee some of the additional questions\nthat we have to answer and\n\n49\n00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,990\nwhat their impact is on our installation.\n\n50\n00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,304\nSo, for this one,\nI can go ahead and hit download and\n\n51\n00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:01,260\nit's going to download that installer and\nit's going to run it.\n\n52\n00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,100\nNow, to save some time,\nI've already downloaded it.\n\n53\n00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,840\nWhen it downloads,\n\n54\n00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,920\nit just throws it into your applications\nfolder and you'll find it right in there.\n\n55\n00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,950\nInstall OSX or OS 10 Yosemite.\n\n56\n00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,000\nSo you will see it right there.\n\n57\n00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,530\nNow, all the installer does\nis is it just runs this.\n\n58\n00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,150\nSo if I were to hit download in\nthe app store it would download it and\n\n59\n00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,260\nthen it would run this.\n\n60\n00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,080\nIf it's in the process of downloading\nyou'll see the icon here.\n\n61\n00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,770\nIt will have a little download bar on\nit to show the status of the download.\n\n62\n00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,510\nYou've got to wait for it to be done.\n\n63\n00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,030\nBut once it's done you can run it and\n\n64\n00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,420\nyou'll see this screen right here,\nall right.\n\n65\n00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,500\nThis is the Yosemite upgrade wizard and\nIt's really straight forward.\n\n66\n00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,920\nIt's letting me know that it's\nabout to install OS X 10.10 and\n\n67\n00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,490\nI could hit continue.\n\n68\n00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,970\nI have to sign off on a license agreement,\nright,\n\n69\n00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,850\nthey have all the various\ninformation that pertains to this,\n\n70\n00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,250\nwhich I've read thoroughly and\nagree on every single clause.\n\n71\n00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,280\nActually I don't know that I've\never actually read that thing.\n\n72\n00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,740\nBut I'll go ahead and agree to it anyway\nbecause that's the society we live in.\n\n73\n00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,790\nAnd now it's ready to do the upgrade.\n\n74\n00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,170\nNow, notice it's not really\ngiving me a choice here.\n\n75\n00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,490\nThis looks like a choice screen.\n\n76\n00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,370\nSometimes if you have more than one hard\ndrive you can pick where you want to\n\n77\n00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,570\ninstall Yosemite.\n\n78\n00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,230\nBut because this is\nan upgrade it looks for\n\n79\n00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,640\nthe currently running OS, finds where it's\ninstalled, and it shows me a hard drive.\n\n80\n00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,290\nSo I don't actually click on that.\n\n81\n00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,280\nIt doesn't do anything, I just see\nthe hard drive and I click Install, right?\n\n82\n00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,140\nSo it's really not a question at all.\n\n83\n00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,730\nWhen I hit Install,\nI do have to be an administrator, so\n\n84\n00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,920\nI'll provide my password.\n\n85\n00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,250\nAnd now it doesn't.\n\n86\n00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,730\nSo it really isn't very\nquestion rich at all.\n\n87\n00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,120\nWe just hit next a few times,\npunch in our password, and off it goes.\n\n88\n00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,000\nBecause this is an upgrade,\nit's going to preserve my settings.\n\n89\n00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,040\nSo anything I've done to customize\nthis computer will still be there.\n\n90\n00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,720\nFor example, I've installed some\napplications or at least I think I have.\n\n91\n00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,570\nSo if we look in my Applications\nhere I can see, yeah,\n\n92\n00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,620\nthere's the little Write program\nthat I like to take notes in.\n\n93\n00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,290\nI've probably installed some other\nstuff on here, nothing too crazy.\n\n94\n00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,930\nBut any customizations that you might have\ndone, any preferences that you changed.\n\n95\n00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,280\nSo for example if I went into my System\nPreferences and I made some changes to.\n\n96\n00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,350\nActually here,\nlet me make some changes in Finder.\n\n97\n00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,870\nI always change some things in\nFinder when I work on these systems.\n\n98\n00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,550\nSo if I go into my Finder Preferences,\n\n99\n00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,660\nwhich I'm having a hard time clicking on,\nthere we go.\n\n100\n00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,830\nI might choose to show hard drives on\nmy desktops and connected servers.\n\n101\n00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,730\nI might choose to change my\nsidebar a little bit to include or\n\n102\n00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,820\nexclude some things.\n\n103\n00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,750\nThese are all personal settings that I\nmight choose to put on here to change\n\n104\n00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,600\nthe way that the finder works, right?\n\n105\n00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,220\nAll of this is going to come\nalong with the upgrade, right?\n\n106\n00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,400\nThe upgrade doesn't lose my settings,\nthat's the nice part of doing an upgrade.\n\n107\n00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,020\nWe do a clean install,\nwe do lose those settings and\n\n108\n00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,890\nthat's not necessarily\nsomething that we want.\n\n109\n00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,960\nWe want to talk about recovery installs\nlater on, probably in the next episode.\n\n110\n00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,070\nAnd they're kind of an exception\nto that but for the most part,\n\n111\n00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,570\nwhen you boot from installation media,\nyou're going to lose your settings.\n\n112\n00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,130\nWith this upgrade, we're not.\n\n113\n00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,430\nAll right, let me make another change,\nI don't think it's too late for\n\n114\n00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,130\nme to make changes.\n\n115\n00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,290\nI can change like my desktop wallpaper,\nright.\n\n116\n00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,970\nSo if I change that to something else,\nall right,\n\n117\n00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,510\nlet's see if we can't find something fun.\n\n118\n00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,800\nIf it will let me.\n\n119\n00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,480\nMaybe it's too late.\n\n120\n00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,410\nNope, there we go.\n\n121\n00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,480\nSo maybe I'll go to one of\nthese little space scenes, so\n\n122\n00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,970\nthere I've got my space wallpaper set,\nthis thing is ready to do the install, so\n\n123\n00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,630\nnow it's telling me to restart.\n\n124\n00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,230\nSo I'll go ahead and hit restart.\n\n125\n00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,340\nIt's going to reboot, it's not actually\ndone with the install though, so\n\n126\n00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,770\nwhen I give it a reboot here,\n\n127\n00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,450\nI'll just hit close other applications,\nand now it's going to reboot the system.\n\n128\n00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,360\nWhen it reboots, it's going to\nactually perform the upgrade.\n\n129\n00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,000\nSo it's going to copy some\nmore files over, get it ready,\n\n130\n00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,680\nand then boot the system.\n\n131\n00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,370\nSo this reboot that it does\nright here is going to take\n\n132\n00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,990\nlonger than a normal boot up would.\n\n133\n00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,670\nMost of the time you boot up and\nit's done in a matter of seconds.\n\n134\n00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,660\nThis one is going to take longer\nbecause it's copying those files.\n\n135\n00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,650\nBut when it's done,\nI'll be running Yosemite.\n\n136\n00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,000\nI was running Mavericks, 10.9.\n\n137\n00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,690\nNow I'm running Yosemite, 10.10.\n\n138\n00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,510\nAnd all of my settings and\napplications should still be there.\n\n139\n00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,940\nMy space wallpaper,\nmy finder preferences should be changed,\n\n140\n00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,220\nmy note taking write application\nshould still be there.\n\n141\n00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,590\nSo those programs should be there\njust like they were before.\n\n142\n00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,280\nThis is the easiest type of install.\n\n143\n00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,850\nNow, as a learning tool\nthat's not very good.\n\n144\n00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,430\nBecause all I did was\nclick next a few times.\n\n145\n00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,750\nSo what did we really learn there?\n\n146\n00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,670\nWell, we didn't learn anything we\ndidn't see in the first episode.\n\n147\n00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,430\nWhere things are different\nare where we do a clean install.\n\n148\n00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,460\nWhen you do a clean install\nyou get a lot more choices.\n\n149\n00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,670\nNow, when would we do a clean install?\n\n150\n00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,400\nMaybe I've had my Mac for a few years and\n\n151\n00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,190\nit's got kind of junked up with\nsoftware and it's running a lot slower.\n\n152\n00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,370\nI'm starting to see the spinning color\nwheel a lot more frequently than I\n\n153\n00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:47,926\nused to.\n\n154\n00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,489\nMaybe I had a failed hard drive, and\nI had to replace the hard drive.\n\n155\n00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,399\nAnd now I've got a completely blank one.\n\n156\n00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,736\nThese are times where we might\nchoose to do a clean install.\n\n157\n00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:59,787\nA clean install would give us a fresh and\nclean installation of Yosemite,\n\n158\n00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:02,940\nthat just has the stuff straight\nfrom the Apple factory.\n\n159\n00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,300\nIt will run super fast and\nit will run at a nice blazing speed for\n\n160\n00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,669\nus, and\nthen we can customize it from there.\n\n161\n00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,230\nMy system just rebooted and\nhere's that long boot I was talking about.\n\n162\n00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,700\nSee how, it says it's\nInstalling on my Macintosh HD,\n\n163\n00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,320\nand it's gonna take about 18 minutes.\n\n164\n00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,770\nSo, now it's actually doing that upgrade.\n\n165\n00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,640\nNow, I don't wanna sit here for\n18 minutes.\n\n166\n00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,188\nMostly cuz I can't think of 18\nminutes of stuff to talk about.\n\n167\n00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:30,240\nSo instead, [LAUGH] what we'll do is\nwe'll jump over to a clean install\n\n168\n00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,580\nwhile this is running, and\nthen when it's done we'll come back and\n\n169\n00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,670\ntake a look at it and\nsee where it's at, all right?\n\n170\n00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,650\nSo, I'm just gonna leave that\nrunning in the background.\n\n171\n00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,710\nThat'll be something for\nus to jump back to.\n\n172\n00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,360\nBut, in the meantime I wanna\nshow you a clean install.\n\n173\n00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,260\nNow, if we're gonna do a clean install,\nwhere's that come from?\n\n174\n00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,330\nWell, a clean install, if you lost your\ndrive, then your hard drive is blank.\n\n175\n00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,240\nAnd you've gotta get that Yosemite\ninstallation from somewhere.\n\n176\n00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,050\nSo you'll need some kind\nof USB bootable media, or\n\n177\n00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,370\nan external hard drive of some sort,\nor an internal hard drive,\n\n178\n00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,000\nif you have another one that has\nthe Yosemite installation data on it.\n\n179\n00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,950\nIn the first episode we talk about, how to\ncreate that removable installation media?\n\n180\n00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,950\nSo you go to another Mac somewhere,\nand you create one.\n\n181\n00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,740\nIf you only have one Mac and that's it,\nit's a good idea to go ahead and create\n\n182\n00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,820\nthat removable media installation right\nnow, while you're not having a problem.\n\n183\n00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,100\nThat way when the day comes that you\ndo have a problem, you've got it.\n\n184\n00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,960\nIf you lost your hard drive and you only\nhad one Mac, you don't have a way to make\n\n185\n00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,240\nthat removable media, and\nnow you're kind of in trouble.\n\n186\n00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,600\nSo, that's where you have to basically\ntake your computer down to the Apple\n\n187\n00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,420\nstore, and\nthey'll take care of it for you.\n\n188\n00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,700\nIt's easy to have them fix it for you,\n\n189\n00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,115\nbut there's the inconvenience\nof having to go down there.\n\n190\n00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:42,565\nIf you've already got your removable\nmedia, you're in good shape.\n\n191\n00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:44,865\nSo what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna take a virtual machine,\n\n192\n00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:47,705\nthat I have here that has\na completely blank hard drive.\n\n193\n00:09:47,705 --> 00:09:52,795\nThat has absolutely no installation on\nit whatsoever, hard drive is blank.\n\n194\n00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:56,615\nAnd I've added my\ninstallation media to it.\n\n195\n00:09:56,615 --> 00:09:59,795\nAnd I wanna boot that system\nup into a clean install.\n\n196\n00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:03,600\nBut when I boot it up, the Mac is gonna\nsee that the hard drive is empty.\n\n197\n00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,060\nIt's gonna see there's nothing on there.\n\n198\n00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,185\nAnd it's gonna see that USB media, and\n\n199\n00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:10,220\nit's gonna know to boot\noff of the USB media.\n\n200\n00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,140\nSo, in the case of a failed hard drive,\nit's really just a matter of\n\n201\n00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,220\nputting the new hard drive in,\nplugging in your installation media.\n\n202\n00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,620\nAnd then booting the system up, and\n\n203\n00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,200\nit'll go right into the installer and\noff you go.\n\n204\n00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,740\nBut, remember that scenario\nI mentioned earlier.\n\n205\n00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,380\nWhat if my computer is just really\njunked up after years of use, and\n\n206\n00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,660\nit's got a good O/S on there,\nit's got a good hard drive.\n\n207\n00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,950\nBut, I wanna wipe it all out.\n\n208\n00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,920\nWell, when you boot your computer up it's\ngonna see that installation on the hard\n\n209\n00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,310\ndrive and it's gonna boot from that.\n\n210\n00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,730\nSo, we have to tell our Mac\nto boot from removable media.\n\n211\n00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,928\nThe easiest way to do that is\nwhen you're booting up your Mac,\n\n212\n00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:47,820\nwhen you hit that Power button,\nhold down the Option key on your keyboard.\n\n213\n00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,560\nOr if you're using a Windows\nkeyboard it would be the Alt key.\n\n214\n00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,942\nBut the Option key,\nif you hold the Option key while you boot.\n\n215\n00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:57,100\nWhat's gonna happen is,\nit's gonna start to boot,\n\n216\n00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,380\nit'll see you are holding down that key,\nand then it will display a boot menu.\n\n217\n00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,780\nAnd the boot menu will show your\ndifferent hard drives, all right?\n\n218\n00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,320\nYou'll see your internal hard drive,\nyou'll see your external hard drives if\n\n219\n00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,390\nyou have them, you'll see your USB keys\nif you've got them, your CD or DVD drive,\n\n220\n00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,710\nyour super drive.\n\n221\n00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,840\nYou'll see each of those on the screen,\nand you can pick what you boot from.\n\n222\n00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,255\nYou don't wanna oot from\nyour regular Mac OS install,\n\n223\n00:11:18,255 --> 00:11:20,210\nbecause that's the one that's jumped up.\n\n224\n00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,810\nYou wanna boot from your install media.\n\n225\n00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,960\nSo you'd hold down that Option Key,\nand you'd pick the install media.\n\n226\n00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,820\nWith a blank hard drive\nthe install media is,\n\n227\n00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,219\nall that's there so it's automatically\n\n228\n00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:42,730\ngonna boot from it spend\na ton of time on it here.\n\n229\n00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,230\nBut for\nmost people holding down the Option key or\n\n230\n00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,850\nthe Alt key, that's the one\nthat's gonna do what we need.\n\n231\n00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,980\nAll right, so I'm gonna take this\nother machine, which I've got parked\n\n232\n00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,570\naround here somewhere,\nlet me figure out what I've done with it.\n\n233\n00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,658\nAnd here we go, it's this guy right here.\n\n234\n00:11:57,658 --> 00:12:01,575\nSo, I'm gonna fire up this machine, and\nlike I said, it's completely blank.\n\n235\n00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:03,520\nIts hard drive is completely blank.\n\n236\n00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,390\nSo when the system boots up, it sees\nthis blank hard drive and then it says,\n\n237\n00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,110\nwell there's gotta be something else.\n\n238\n00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,130\nAnd it looks, and\n\n239\n00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,300\nit finds the installation media\nthat I've attached to it.\n\n240\n00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,730\nSo, it's looking for it right now,\n\n241\n00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,970\nthat's why it's kind of stalled right\nthere at that little white dot.\n\n242\n00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,010\nAnd then it's gonna find it, and\nit'll boot off of that installation media.\n\n243\n00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:26,640\nAnd when it does that, it's gonna take\nme into the full Mac OS Installer.\n\n244\n00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,420\nWe saw the Upgrade Installer a minute ago,\n\n245\n00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,100\nand with the Upgrade Installer,\nit really didn't have a lot of questions.\n\n246\n00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,440\nWe just hit Next a handful of times and\nthat was the end of it.\n\n247\n00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,200\nBut here we're gonna see more.\n\n248\n00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,115\nMost importantly, we're gonna have\nthe option to partition our hard drive.\n\n249\n00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:42,385\nLet's talk about that.\n\n250\n00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:45,203\nThe default, when you do an install,\n\n251\n00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:49,465\nis it will take the whole hard drive and\napply it to Mac OS.\n\n252\n00:12:49,465 --> 00:12:51,575\nOne big hard drive partition and\nthat's it.\n\n253\n00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:55,265\nAnd it will mount it in\nyour main hard drive, so\n\n254\n00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:58,560\nit's just your /folder,\nyour root of your hard drive.\n\n255\n00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,930\nThis is what we normally\ncall the Macintosh HD,\n\n256\n00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,400\nthat's the name that it assigns\nto it by default, and that's it.\n\n257\n00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,360\nBut, if we're doing\nthe clean install ourselves,\n\n258\n00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,790\nwe can actually choose to divide\nour hard drive up into partitions.\n\n259\n00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,500\nAnd if we do that we have little bit\nmore control over what's gonna happen.\n\n260\n00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,620\nAnd in the exam objectives,\nApple calls this out, and\n\n261\n00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,290\nthey say you've got understand\nthe different pros and\n\n262\n00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,620\ncons, of doing a single drive\nversus multiple partitions.\n\n263\n00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,150\nSo, let's talk a little about\nwhy we do one over the other?\n\n264\n00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:35,770\nIf you do a single partition, right, that\nis the easiest for the end user, right?\n\n265\n00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,250\nThe end user just has one drive,\nall their documents,\n\n266\n00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,270\ntheir operating system, everything\nthey need is right there in one drive.\n\n267\n00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,350\nWhen they navigate in finder,\n\n268\n00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,006\nthey just go the the one drive\neverything's there, all right?\n\n269\n00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:51,200\nFor the tech support guy,\nthat can be a little more challenging.\n\n270\n00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,220\nCuz now we have user files that are mixed\ntogether with operating system files all\n\n271\n00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,650\non the same drive.\n\n272\n00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,860\nAnd as those user files get bigger and\n\n273\n00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,930\nbigger, they can start to interfere\nwith the operating system files.\n\n274\n00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,090\nIf we fill up the hard\ndrive with user files,\n\n275\n00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,000\nfor example, the operating\nsystem starts to have problems.\n\n276\n00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,990\nSo, it's not the greatest from that\nperspective, but for the end user,\n\n277\n00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,700\nit's the easiest and\nit works fine for most of us.\n\n278\n00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,840\nAs long as you don't\nfill up your hard drive,\n\n279\n00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,260\nit's actually pretty difficult\nto do any damage to it.\n\n280\n00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,720\nAnd so, at least 90%,\n\n281\n00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,520\nprobably more of people, are using just\nthe single volume install, all right?\n\n282\n00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,420\nSo that's typically what we'll go with.\n\n283\n00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,600\nBut, if you divide your hard drive up,\nyou can do some neat stuff.\n\n284\n00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,180\nOne thing that's pretty popular,\nis to divide the hard drive in half.\n\n285\n00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,200\nSo it's still one physical hard drive,\nright?\n\n286\n00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,440\nIf the hard drive goes bad\nyou lose the whole thing.\n\n287\n00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,940\nBut if we divide it up into logical\nvolumes, we can have one volume, or\n\n288\n00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,490\none partition,\nwhich is where our operating system is.\n\n289\n00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,030\nThat's where we put Mac OS, right?\n\n290\n00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,340\nAnd then we have another partition, and\nthat's where we put our user stuff.\n\n291\n00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,890\nOur documents, our pictures, our videos,\nour applications if we want, or\n\n292\n00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,600\nwe can leave those on the other drive.\n\n293\n00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,130\nBy separating it out like this,\nit makes it really easy for\n\n294\n00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,840\nus to redo the operating system.\n\n295\n00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,630\nIf we wanna go on a format and\nwipe out that operating system partition,\n\n296\n00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,100\nwe can, and all of our user data is safe,\non this other partition.\n\n297\n00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,170\nSo, we get a little bit\nof flexibility there.\n\n298\n00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:18,590\nAlso, if we fill up that drive that has\nour user data on it, well, it's full.\n\n299\n00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,750\nBut the operating system has its\nown drive, its own partition, and\n\n300\n00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,530\nso it's not out of space,\nit continues to run fine.\n\n301\n00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,900\nSo it gives us a little bit\nmore safety and security,\n\n302\n00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,180\nand it makes it easy to\nidentify where our data is.\n\n303\n00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,350\nMy user data is on this other volume,\nnot on the local,\n\n304\n00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,370\nwhere the operating system is.\n\n305\n00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,040\nIt's separated out.\n\n306\n00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,940\nAnother advantage of going\nwith multiple volumes is,\n\n307\n00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,240\nif you wanna do dual booting, right?\n\n308\n00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,350\nLike with Boot Camp.\n\n309\n00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,150\nIf you install Boot Camp on your system.\n\n310\n00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,590\nAnd we're gonna do an episode\non Boot Camp later on.\n\n311\n00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,050\nBoot Camp will allow you to run\nWindows side-by-side with Mac OS.\n\n312\n00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,521\nYou can't run them both at the same time.\n\n313\n00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:53,618\nIt's one or the other.\n\n314\n00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,629\nWhen you boot the computer up,\nyou'll pick.\n\n315\n00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:58,433\nDo you wanna boot to Mac OS, or\ndo you wanna boot to Windows?\n\n316\n00:15:58,433 --> 00:15:59,010\nAll right?\n\n317\n00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,051\nAnd the two need to be separate, and\n\n318\n00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:04,420\ncreating separate\npartitions will allow that.\n\n319\n00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,380\nThe other thing is with Macs we\nalways want to format those hard\n\n320\n00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,420\ndrives as HFS, right?\n\n321\n00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,970\nAs that journaled file system.\n\n322\n00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,200\nThat's what we want.\n\n323\n00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,010\nWindows doesn't recognize that.\n\n324\n00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,610\nAnd with Windows, we always wanna\nformat the hard drives as NTFS.\n\n325\n00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,200\nRight?\n\n326\n00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,070\nThat's the Windows file system.\n\n327\n00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,080\nMac doesn't like that, right?\n\n328\n00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,480\nSo, by doing separate volumes,\nseparate partitions,\n\n329\n00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,650\nthey can format the drives however they\nwant and it doesn't affect the other one.\n\n330\n00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:32,140\nBut it might not be Windows, you might\nwant to boot more than one copy of Mac OS.\n\n331\n00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,850\nMaybe you've got one copy of\nMac OS that you use for work,\n\n332\n00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,000\nand when you boot up to that,\nit's all work stuff.\n\n333\n00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,120\nWork applications and that's it.\n\n334\n00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,300\nBut then you've got another installation\nof Mac OS, that when you boot to it,\n\n335\n00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,450\nit's your personal stuff.\n\n336\n00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,595\nYou've got video games, things like that.\n\n337\n00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:45,565\nPut that in there.\n\n338\n00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:48,355\nNow when you boot up you just want\nto choose which volume you boot to.\n\n339\n00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:51,455\nAnd so you hold that alt key\nlike I described earlier and\n\n340\n00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,205\nyou pick between the two volumes.\n\n341\n00:16:53,205 --> 00:16:56,585\nThat's some of the power we get\nby dividing our hard drive up\n\n342\n00:16:56,585 --> 00:16:58,205\ninto multiple volumes.\n\n343\n00:16:58,205 --> 00:17:00,425\nKey thing to remember for the exam though.\n\n344\n00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:03,780\nDividing them up into virtual or\nlogical volumes like this.\n\n345\n00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,230\nDoes not provide a backup functionality.\n\n346\n00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,320\nSo if you're thinking about dividing\nyour hard drive in half, and\n\n347\n00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,430\nusing half for time machine, and half for\nyour regular OS, that's a bad idea, right?\n\n348\n00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,590\nI don't think it'll\nactually let you do that.\n\n349\n00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,130\nBut, the problem is,\nif you lose the physical hard drive,\n\n350\n00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,340\nyou lose all the volumes.\n\n351\n00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,020\nIt's not like you have one volume that\nwill survive, and the other one dies.\n\n352\n00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,570\nYou lose them all.\n\n353\n00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:25,530\nSo, for things like time machine and\nbackup it needs to be an external or\n\n354\n00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,370\nsecondary drive,\nnot the main drive where your data is.\n\n355\n00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,930\nAll right, well on this system it booted\nup, and it took me to this screen.\n\n356\n00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,610\nAnd normally there's some\nlittle words like welcome or\n\n357\n00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,490\nwhatever that are floating by.\n\n358\n00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,475\nI think I talked so\nlong that they all floated away.\n\n359\n00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:44,020\n[LAUGH] But basically it's just asking\nme what language I want to speak and\n\n360\n00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,610\nit's given me the list of different,\noh there they are they magically appeared.\n\n361\n00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,300\nSo there's all the,\nall the words right there and\n\n362\n00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,950\nwe can kinda pick what\nlanguages we want to speak.\n\n363\n00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,040\nI'm going to stick with English\njust to stay out of trouble here.\n\n364\n00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,540\nIf I pick another language I might\nnot be able to complete the wizard.\n\n365\n00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,920\nAnd then it brings me to the installer.\n\n366\n00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,410\nNow there's a lot of things you can\ndo from the installer in here, but\n\n367\n00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,250\nthese are the four main\nitems that we can pick from.\n\n368\n00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,470\nThe first one is restore\nfrom a time machine backup.\n\n369\n00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,800\nIf my computer is messed up, and\n\n370\n00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,100\nI have to replace the hard drive,\nwell I just lost all my data.\n\n371\n00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,230\nBut if I've got a time machine backup,\n\n372\n00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,770\nI can just restore from the time machine\nbackup, and I'll be in business.\n\n373\n00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,620\nI booted off my install media.\n\n374\n00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,340\nI hook up whatever drive has my\ntime machine backup, and I restore.\n\n375\n00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:29,870\nRight?\n\n376\n00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,780\nAnd we'll time machine.\n\n377\n00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,370\nWe'll have a dedicated episode for\nthat one too.\n\n378\n00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,520\nWe've got install OSX and\nthat's what I want.\n\n379\n00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,400\nRight?\nThat's the one that's going\n\n380\n00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,590\nto actually install the Operating System\non the drive and that'll put it in place.\n\n381\n00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,470\nSo it can give me a nice,\nfresh, clean install from Apple.\n\n382\n00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,250\nNow it also can upgrade.\n\n383\n00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,080\nSee how it's got that option?\n\n384\n00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,426\nSo if I'm gonna be picking a drive\nthat already has Mac OS on it,\n\n385\n00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:54,430\nit's gonna upgrade it.\n\n386\n00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,780\nAnd that might not be what I want.\n\n387\n00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,880\nI might want a fresh and clean install.\n\n388\n00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,550\nAnd I'll show you how to get\naround that in just a moment.\n\n389\n00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,020\nWe've got Get Help Online.\n\n390\n00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,210\nNow be careful with this one.\n\n391\n00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,820\nWhat it does is it launches Safari, and\n\n392\n00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,490\nit goes to Apple's website\nto the help documentation.\n\n393\n00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,770\nThat means you have to\nhave a network connection.\n\n394\n00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,120\nIf you're not plugged into the network,\nor you're not on a wireless network or\n\n395\n00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,720\nwhatever, you might not be able to\nget to it, and if you just booted\n\n396\n00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,760\nfrom your install media, you very well\nmay not have network connectivity.\n\n397\n00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,170\nSo you may not be able\nto get to that site.\n\n398\n00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,010\nThe last one is Disk Utility.\n\n399\n00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,000\nAnd this is the one we can use\nto look at our hard drives and\n\n400\n00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,910\npartition them if we want.\n\n401\n00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,040\nNow there's two reasons we go\ninto the Disk Utility here.\n\n402\n00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,640\nThe first reason is if\nwe want to partition.\n\n403\n00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,720\nIf we want to divide our hard drive up,\nwe can go right in there and do it.\n\n404\n00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,410\nThe second reason is,\nif I've already got a Mac install.\n\n405\n00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,020\nIf I already have Mac OS installed and\nI don't want it to upgrade, I can got\n\n406\n00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,750\ninto the Disc Utility and I can erase\nthe disc which will stop the upgrade.\n\n407\n00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,950\nRight now it will be a clean install.\n\n408\n00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,870\nLet's take a look at that process.\n\n409\n00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,870\nSo if I launch my Disc Utility so I'm just\ngoing to select that and hit continue.\n\n410\n00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,610\nIt's going to show my hard drive and\n\n411\n00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,900\nI've got a hard drive that's in here that\nis, I think 60 gigs or apparently 43 gigs.\n\n412\n00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,220\nThere's an odd size for\nit's pick, but that's what I got.\n\n413\n00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,070\nSo, I've got this 43-gig hard drive\nup here and there's my Macintosh HD.\n\n414\n00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,070\nNow if I go in here and look at what I've\ngot, it's kind of showing the drive.\n\n415\n00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,520\nI can see my installer over here, right?\n\n416\n00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,910\nMy OS X install ESB,\nmy OS X base system, right?\n\n417\n00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,380\nThese are my installation\ndisks that I've got.\n\n418\n00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,100\nBut the hard drive itself is right here.\n\n419\n00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,720\nSo I can see that drive.\n\n420\n00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,320\nAnd if it's already got\nMac OS installed on it and\n\n421\n00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,010\nI just want to start from scratch,\nthen I can go to erase.\n\n422\n00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:47,910\nAnd I can choose the format type and\npartition name, and I can hit erase.\n\n423\n00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:52,220\nAnd that's going to wipe out,\nall the stuff that was on that drive and\n\n424\n00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,380\nnow when I do my install,\nit will be a fresh and clean install.\n\n425\n00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,540\nIf I don't erase it,\n\n426\n00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,010\nit's gonna do an upgrade of\nwhatever is in there on the system.\n\n427\n00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,670\nThat means it's gonna\npreserve all of my settings.\n\n428\n00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,920\nNow, if I wanna do multiple partitions,\nmaybe I decide,\n\n429\n00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,950\nhey, I wanna have Mac OS and Windows.\n\n430\n00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:16,320\nOr, I wanna have Mac OS on one partition\nand my user data on another data, right?\n\n431\n00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,600\nIf I want that,\nthen I need to divide this drive up.\n\n432\n00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,820\nAnd to do that, I need to click\non the physical drive itself.\n\n433\n00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,590\nWhen I click on the physical drive,\nthe partition button will appear, right?\n\n434\n00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,630\nYou know you're in the wrong spot\nif you don't see partition, right?\n\n435\n00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,260\nIf I'm on this actual partition,\nthe button's gone.\n\n436\n00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,080\nBut if I click on the physical drive,\n\n437\n00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,180\nthe partition button appears, and here's\nwhere I can go in and divide my drive up.\n\n438\n00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,190\nThey currently Al,\nis that I've got McIntosh ADAD and\n\n439\n00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,210\nit fills up the whole drive.\n\n440\n00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:48,240\nOkay, I can change that and\npick how many partitions I want, up to 16.\n\n441\n00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,910\nWell if I just want to have\nthe Operating System and the user space,\n\n442\n00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,820\nI can choose two partitions and now\nit's going to divide them up like that.\n\n443\n00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,690\nWell, I need to give them names so that I\ncan kind of recognize what they are and\n\n444\n00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,490\nif you take a look at them,\nis naming them Untitled 1 and Untitled 2,\n\n445\n00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,600\nthat's a little confusing, right?\n\n446\n00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:13,210\nSo, I'll take Untitled 1, and I'll\njust call that my Operating System HD,\n\n447\n00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:19,780\nall right, and I'll call my other one,\nI'll call that one User Data.\n\n448\n00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,550\nYeah, User Data is fine.\n\n449\n00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,000\nUser Data HD.\n\n450\n00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,390\nSo now I've got these two hard drives,\nthey're virtual hard drives,\n\n451\n00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,480\nthere's one physical hard drive, but\nnow I've got these two locations.\n\n452\n00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,210\nNow If you look at it,\nit divided it in half equally.\n\n453\n00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,030\nI might not want that.\n\n454\n00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,040\nWell here my job is pretty small so\nI will.\n\n455\n00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,360\nBut if you've got a terabyte drive,\n\n456\n00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,000\nyou don't need to assign 500 gigs\nto your Operating System, right.\n\n457\n00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,020\nMac OS, it'll run fine in 20,\n40 gigs, whatever.\n\n458\n00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,030\nSo maybe you just set 100 gigs aside for\nit.\n\n459\n00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,070\nAnd you set 900 gigs aside for\nyour user data, right,\n\n460\n00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,630\nthat's where the bulk of your\ninformation is going to be.\n\n461\n00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,360\nSo you can change these sizes right\nover here to make it larger and smaller.\n\n462\n00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,110\nOr, you can just use this arrow right\nhere and you can drag it up and down.\n\n463\n00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,140\nBe careful though, you do need to\nmake sure you have enough room for\n\n464\n00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,190\nthat Operating System.\n\n465\n00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,010\nOtherwise, it's not going to\nbe able to install, right?\n\n466\n00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,500\nApple recommends that you have at least\neight gigabytes of space set aside for\n\n467\n00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,810\nthe Operating System.\n\n468\n00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,830\nI usually recommend that you go a little\nbit more than that, so we'll try and\n\n469\n00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:23,050\nset it,\nhere I'll just set it to 20 gigs even.\n\n470\n00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,820\nThere we go, and that'll leave 23 gigs for\nmy user drive, all right.\n\n471\n00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,430\nNow this user drive,\nmaybe I put my user data there,\n\n472\n00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,340\nthat's fine or\nmaybe I use this for Windows.\n\n473\n00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,490\nAnd later, I go and\ninstall Windows on it, using Boot Camp.\n\n474\n00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,830\nOr I can come back and install a second\ncopy of Mac OS on this other partition.\n\n475\n00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,900\nNow I've got that capability.\n\n476\n00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,093\nAll right, now it hasn't\nactually applied any of this yet.\n\n477\n00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,795\nSo once you get it set the way\nthat you want, you hit apply.\n\n478\n00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:52,441\nAnd now, it's gonna partition it out.\n\n479\n00:23:52,441 --> 00:23:55,103\nSo it's warning me, I'm gonna lose\nall the data that's on the drive.\n\n480\n00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:58,199\nAnd it's going to create these two\nnew partitions, so I'll go ahead and\n\n481\n00:23:58,199 --> 00:23:59,990\nhit partition and it's going to do that.\n\n482\n00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,630\nIt usually doesn't take too\nterribly long and when it's done,\n\n483\n00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,440\nI should see my two new discs\nright here and there they are.\n\n484\n00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,100\nOperating system HD and\nuser data HD, right?\n\n485\n00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,530\nBoth right in place.\n\n486\n00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,270\nOnce you've got your disc set the way\nthat you want, you go ahead and\n\n487\n00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:20,220\nget out of the disc utility, I am\ngoing to quit out of the disc utility.\n\n488\n00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,240\nAnd now back on the main screen,\nI can go to Install OSX and\n\n489\n00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,560\nwe're going to see these drives that\nwe can pick from for the install.\n\n490\n00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,120\nNow from this point out,\n\n491\n00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,940\nit's pretty similar to the upgrade\nthat we saw a moment ago.\n\n492\n00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,610\nIf I hit Continue,\nit's going to move forward and\n\n493\n00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,230\nI'll get my screen just like\nwe saw with the upgrade.\n\n494\n00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,350\nI'll get my End User License Agreement,\nwhich I'll agree to blindly.\n\n495\n00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,400\nThere we go, and\nnow I can pick from the hard drives.\n\n496\n00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,680\nNow I see my installation\nmedia right there.\n\n497\n00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,170\nI can't install that, right,\nthat's my installation media.\n\n498\n00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:57,810\nBut now I see Operating System HD and\nUser Data HD and\n\n499\n00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,138\nI can pick where I want to install it.\n\n500\n00:25:00,138 --> 00:25:04,080\nI'm going to on Operating System HD so\nI'll choose that one If I was coming back\n\n501\n00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,120\nand installing a second copy of Mac OS,\nI would pick this other drive, but\n\n502\n00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,160\nin my case, I want that for user data,\nso I am just going to leave it be and\n\n503\n00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,540\nI'll choose my operating system HD and\nI'll hit install.\n\n504\n00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,050\nAll right?\n\n505\n00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,940\nThere it goes,\nnow it's going to launch the installer and\n\n506\n00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,520\nit's going to run through that process.\n\n507\n00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,700\nNow the upgrade, it rebooted and\nit said it was going to take 18 minutes,\n\n508\n00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,670\nwhile here it's actually copying the data\nfrom my install media over to the drive\n\n509\n00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:33,090\nand a fresh install is a lot\nfaster than an upgrade.\n\n510\n00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,400\nIt's not having to preserve my\nsettings and update file permissions.\n\n511\n00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,970\nSo we'll find this process\ngoes a lot more quickly.\n\n512\n00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,710\nThat being said, it's going to take longer\nthan I want to wait, so what we'll do is,\n\n513\n00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,680\nwe'll stop here and take a break.\n\n514\n00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,630\nAnd during the break, this install\nwill finish, the upgrade will finish,\n\n515\n00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,990\nand we'll pick back up and\ntake a look at what happened and\n\n516\n00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,130\ngive us a chance to see\nthat finished product.\n\n517\n00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,790\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n518\n00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,232\nWe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n519\n00:25:57,232 --> 00:25:57,974\n[SOUND]\n\n520\n00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:04,755\n[MUSIC]\n\n521\n00:26:04,755 --> 00:26:07,000\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n522\n00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,900\nSo during our nice long break there,\nthe installation finished and\n\n523\n00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,830\nthe upgrade finished.\n\n524\n00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,340\nNow we're ready to\ncomplete those processes.\n\n525\n00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,990\nLet's pick back up with the one we\nstarted with, which was the upgrade.\n\n526\n00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,840\nSo I had a Mavericks machine.\n\n527\n00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,590\nI did the upgrade.\n\n528\n00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,110\nIt rebooted and it sat at that screen.\n\n529\n00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,690\nIt told me it had 18 minutes remaining.\n\n530\n00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,060\nSo I sat there, sure,\nfor about 18 minutes.\n\n531\n00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,420\nIt was pretty accurate.\n\n532\n00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:27,985\nAnd then it rebooted.\n\n533\n00:26:27,985 --> 00:26:30,075\nAnd now here's what I'm presented with.\n\n534\n00:26:31,115 --> 00:26:36,155\nIn Yosemite, Apple is really\npushing the iCloud integration so\n\n535\n00:26:36,155 --> 00:26:39,775\nif you hadn't already attached your\nsystem to iCloud during the, or\n\n536\n00:26:39,775 --> 00:26:42,975\nbefore the upgrade,\nit's going to ask you to do it now.\n\n537\n00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:43,895\nYou don't have to, right?\n\n538\n00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:45,955\nYou don't have to use their web services.\n\n539\n00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:49,885\nIt just kind of warns you that there's\nsome things that won't be available if\n\n540\n00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:51,075\nyou don't sign up for iCloud.\n\n541\n00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:53,620\nSome features like 'Find My Mac' and\n\n542\n00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,240\nstuff that really require that\niCloud integration in your Apple ID.\n\n543\n00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,500\nWell, I'm going to say don't sign in,\nand I'll just continue.\n\n544\n00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,300\nIt's going to warn me, are you sure?\n\n545\n00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,570\nHere's you chance, you could get it.\n\n546\n00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,466\nYou could back up your iTunes library,\nit'd be awesome.\n\n547\n00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:07,831\nI don't care.\n\n548\n00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,420\nSo we'll go ahead and move forward.\n\n549\n00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,540\nIts going to ask if we want to report\ndiagnostic information back to Apple,\n\n550\n00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,370\nyou can choose to do that or not.\n\n551\n00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,610\nThis computer is going to go away soon,\nso I'll turn that off.\n\n552\n00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,990\nAll right, and\nthen it's going to finish the set up.\n\n553\n00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:26,950\nNow, this was an upgrade on this machine,\nor lets see, did I get the right one?\n\n554\n00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,730\nYes, so this was an upgrade.\n\n555\n00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,820\nSo I finished the upgrade, and\n\n556\n00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,160\nthen now we're going to see\ndifferent settings in place.\n\n557\n00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,830\nWhen it comes up, I can see that\nit launched the app store for me.\n\n558\n00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,540\nRight.\n\n559\n00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,000\nBut I noticed that some of my\npreferences aren't quite right.\n\n560\n00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,570\nI've got this Yosemite wall paper now.\n\n561\n00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,700\nWell, I had set a space wall\npaper prior to doing the upgrade.\n\n562\n00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,250\nIt changed me to the Yosemite wall paper.\n\n563\n00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,878\nSo it does actually change that.\n\n564\n00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:53,180\nAnd I have a little bit of frustration\npoint with this on my own laptop that I\n\n565\n00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,610\nuse multiple monitors and it seems like\nI constantly end up back with this\n\n566\n00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,550\nmountain wallpaper over and over again.\n\n567\n00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,550\nBut other things like my applications\nshould still be there, so\n\n568\n00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,270\nwe'll go in and\nmake sure my application is there.\n\n569\n00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,050\nThe little write program that I use,\nthere it is.\n\n570\n00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,650\nSo I can see that still in place.\n\n571\n00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,550\nMy other preferences are still in place.\n\n572\n00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,990\nI see my hard drive right here in finder.\n\n573\n00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,430\nSo, everything's there like we had before.\n\n574\n00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:19,240\nThe upgrade doesn't lose my data, it\njust puts the operating system in place.\n\n575\n00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,570\nSo, upgrades, really straight forward.\n\n576\n00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,590\nOn the install though,\nit's a little bit different, right, so\n\n577\n00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,230\nthis is the machine that I upgraded\nfrom Mavericks to Yosemite.\n\n578\n00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,880\nIf I jump to the machine that I\nwas doing a fresh install well,\n\n579\n00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,100\nit copied all the files.\n\n580\n00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,020\nIt rebooted, and\n\n581\n00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,340\nnow that it's come up it's got more\nquestions than what the upgrade did.\n\n582\n00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:41,970\nAll right?\n\n583\n00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,730\nFirst it's asking me what region I'm in.\n\n584\n00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,190\nAnd it's asking for\nthe region here for a few reasons.\n\n585\n00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,520\nIt's trying to set your locality for\ncurrency representation.\n\n586\n00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,400\nBut it's also trying to\nfigure out your time zone.\n\n587\n00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,790\nSo we'll see some time questions that'll\nbe tailored to the country that we\n\n588\n00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,960\npick from this list.\n\n589\n00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,110\nSo I'll go ahead and\nchoose the United States and continue.\n\n590\n00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,830\nNow it's going to ask about my keyboard.\n\n591\n00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,210\nIt needs to make sure it understands\nwhat keys you've got on your keyboard.\n\n592\n00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,690\nAnd if you have an Apple authorized\nkeyboard, it'll normally auto-detect it.\n\n593\n00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,290\nYou don't have to worry about this.\n\n594\n00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,470\nI'm on a virtual machine, though.\n\n595\n00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,040\nSo it's seeing a virtual keyboard,\nso I'll tell it that I've got U.S.\n\n596\n00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,250\nNow it probably will recognize\nyour keyboard just fine.\n\n597\n00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,700\nBut if it doesn't,\n\n598\n00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,350\non the next screen it'll ask you to\npress a few keys on the keyboard.\n\n599\n00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:28,710\nLike it'll say press the key immediately\nto the right of the Shift key on the left.\n\n600\n00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,060\nI guess that's kind of confusing.\n\n601\n00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,580\nOr press the key to the left\nof the Shift key on the right.\n\n602\n00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,490\nIt will ask you to press a few keys and\n\n603\n00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,910\nfrom that it'll figure out\nexactly what keyboard you've got.\n\n604\n00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,858\nIn my case,\nit'll figure it out from there.\n\n605\n00:29:40,858 --> 00:29:42,886\nAll right?\n\n606\n00:29:42,886 --> 00:29:46,050\nNow it's going to launch\nthe transfer wizard.\n\n607\n00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,870\nWhen you do an upgrade,\nit doesn't launch the migration\n\n608\n00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,800\nassistant because it knows to migrate\nthe data from your own system.\n\n609\n00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800\nYou're on the system.\n\n610\n00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,270\nThere's not much to migrate.\n\n611\n00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:58,760\nBut when you're doing a brand new Mac or\na brand new install it says hey,\n\n612\n00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,850\nyou might have data on another system,\nwe can bring it in.\n\n613\n00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,670\nAnd it's just offering up some\ndifferent possibilities here.\n\n614\n00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,680\nI can bring it in from another Mac,\nall right.\n\n615\n00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,270\nIf I've got another Mac on my network,\nmy old one, right, or\n\n616\n00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,780\nmaybe I'm replacing it with a new Mac, I\nmight want to bring my data over from it.\n\n617\n00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,760\nWell if that other Mac\nis sitting there and\n\n618\n00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,050\nit still works,\nthere's a few options that I can do there.\n\n619\n00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,930\nI can copy directly form\nit via the network, or\n\n620\n00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,980\nif it's a Macbook, you can put it\ninto what's called target mode.\n\n621\n00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,330\nIn disc target mode,\nyou boot up holding t on the keyboard.\n\n622\n00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:35,280\nYou go into target mode, it turns your Mac\nBook into a giant removable hard drive.\n\n623\n00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,230\nAnd you can stick it on your new Mac and\nit'll migrate your user settings over.\n\n624\n00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,750\nYour preferences, you applications,\nit'll bring that stuff over and\n\n625\n00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,020\nget the new system set up the way\nthat you had on the old one.\n\n626\n00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,880\nIt's like doing upgrade but\nmoving to a new computer.\n\n627\n00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,820\nAll right?\n\n628\n00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,690\nIf your old Mac is dead, if that's\nwhy you're buying this new one, or\n\n629\n00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,630\nin my case where I had to\nreplace the hard drive, right?\n\n630\n00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,690\nSo it's a completely blank hard drive,\nit's not going to be able to migrate those\n\n631\n00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,970\nsettings, so instead I can\nprovide a time machine backup and\n\n632\n00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,220\nit will migrate the settings\nfrom the time machine backup,\n\n633\n00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,330\nso that's another source of that data and\nthen the last source that we have is,\n\n634\n00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,680\nif I just take the hard\ndrive out of the old Mac.\n\n635\n00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,810\nMaybe the old Mac won't\neven power on anymore.\n\n636\n00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:15,060\nAnd so I can open it up,\ntake out my toolkit, crack it open.\n\n637\n00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:18,810\nGet the hard drive out and\nstick the hard drive into this computer.\n\n638\n00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,300\nAnd we can choose that as the startup\ndisk to be able to load that data from.\n\n639\n00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,050\nSo you've got a few\ndifferent options there for\n\n640\n00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,960\nmigrating your settings\nover from a separate PC.\n\n641\n00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,810\nAnother option is from Windows.\n\n642\n00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,320\nIf you want to migrate from Windows.\n\n643\n00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,600\nNow, if we choose this one it does\nlaunch into a different installer\n\n644\n00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,540\nbecause we've got to go\nto the Windows side and\n\n645\n00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,200\nrun a little program that we\ndownload from Apple's website.\n\n646\n00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,240\nAnd it will give you all\nthe instructions to do that.\n\n647\n00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,644\nIf I hit continue it will give us\nthe steps here, and it's looking for\n\n648\n00:31:43,644 --> 00:31:46,180\nthat PC but\nsee right here it's giving an address.\n\n649\n00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:51,944\nIt says you need to go to your PC and\ngo to www.apple.com/migrate-2-mac,\n\n650\n00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:55,648\nand there will be a little\nprogram on there you run.\n\n651\n00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,364\nAnd it will make your Mac find it, so\n\n652\n00:31:57,364 --> 00:31:59,655\nthis source will all of\nthe sudden light up, and\n\n653\n00:31:59,655 --> 00:32:03,630\nthen that program will handle exchanging\nthe data between the two systems.\n\n654\n00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,370\nIt uses the Bonjour protocol, so\nit's almost completely automatic,\n\n655\n00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:10,260\nassuming the two systems are right\nthere on the same network.\n\n656\n00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,250\nAnd it runs pretty well and\nmigrates that data over.\n\n657\n00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,080\nAll right.\n\n658\n00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,930\nIn my case though, I don't have another\nsystem to bring settings over, so\n\n659\n00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,550\nI'm just going to say don't\ntransfer any information.\n\n660\n00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,420\nIf this is a true clean install,\n\n661\n00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,490\nyou probably don't wanna transfer any\ninformation, you wanna start fresh.\n\n662\n00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,220\nSo I'll hit continue.\n\n663\n00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,100\nAnd here it's gonna apply\nme with an Apple ID login.\n\n664\n00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,410\nI'm not going to sign in.\n\n665\n00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,270\nIn real life land you may\nwell choose to do that.\n\n666\n00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,300\nIf you're going to be setting up iCloud,\nthat kind of support.\n\n667\n00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,640\nIf this is gonna be used by\nother people in your company,\n\n668\n00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,910\nyou don't necessarily know their ID.\n\n669\n00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,778\nSo you wouldn't sign in there either.\n\n670\n00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,910\nAll right, I'll go ahead and skip that.\n\n671\n00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,510\nAnd that should be all that it needs.\n\n672\n00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,180\nI can't remember any other questions.\n\n673\n00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,090\nTerms and Agreement, when we installed it,\n\n674\n00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,650\nwe had to accept an end\nuser license agreement.\n\n675\n00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,840\nBut Apple knows that this computer\nmay now be provided to somebody else.\n\n676\n00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,720\nNow it's the end user, and so,\nthis is the end user terms and\n\n677\n00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,070\nconditions that they need to agree to.\n\n678\n00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:05,900\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nagree to it here myself, all right.\n\n679\n00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,790\nAnd now that that's done,\nwe can create our first user account.\n\n680\n00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,120\nYou need to have a user\naccount on the system.\n\n681\n00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,330\nNow keep in mind that this account is\ngoing to be an administrator, right.\n\n682\n00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:17,010\nWe have two different types of\nuser accounts for most people,\n\n683\n00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,650\nwhere you have the administrator and\nthe regular user.\n\n684\n00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:23,290\nMost of your regular employees you\nwant to have regular user accounts.\n\n685\n00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,860\nFor the first administrator account,\nI normally create a generic one.\n\n686\n00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,270\nOne that we use for\nthings like the help desk.\n\n687\n00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:31,360\nSo I'm just gonna put in here help desk,\nright.\n\n688\n00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,850\nSo that account will be here and\nI'll put in a password that I know.\n\n689\n00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,020\nAnd that way,\n\n690\n00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,380\nshould the help desk ever need to gain\nadministrative access to this machine\n\n691\n00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,360\nthey'll have a built in administrator\naccount right here that they can use.\n\n692\n00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,760\nAll right.\n\n693\n00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,670\nIt's going to detect my time zone\nbased on my current location.\n\n694\n00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,190\nThat's fine.\n\n695\n00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,910\nBut if you want to manually choose\na time zone you can uncheck that and\n\n696\n00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,920\non the next screen you'll be\nable to choose the time zone.\n\n697\n00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,080\nI'm just going to leave it checked and\ncontinue.\n\n698\n00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,400\nAnd now we should be good to go.\n\n699\n00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,790\nAll right, our diagnostic and\nusage screen there,\n\n700\n00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,110\nwe just say whether we want\nto report that back to Apple.\n\n701\n00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,986\nMy computer is gonna get wiped here before\ntoo long so I'm gonna turn those off.\n\n702\n00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,219\nAnd there it goes for the initial setup,\nit's creating your user profile for\n\n703\n00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:15,979\nthat account we just made, we'll probably\nneed to follow this up though and\n\n704\n00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:17,630\ncreate other accounts.\n\n705\n00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,880\nBut now that it's done,\nhere it is, it's fired up,\n\n706\n00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,184\nI still have my installation media sitting\nright there that I installed from,\n\n707\n00:34:23,184 --> 00:34:26,561\nI can get rid of that now, I'm done with\nit, I'll just throw that in the trash.\n\n708\n00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:32,433\nAll right, and now I've got a fresh clean\ninstallation of Yosemite and I can go in\n\n709\n00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:36,320\nand start to customize things, get it\nset up the way that I want, all right.\n\n710\n00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,140\nI am still logged in as that\nadministrator account though.\n\n711\n00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:42,140\nSo, one of the first steps that I would do\nis to jump into my system preferences and\n\n712\n00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,200\ngo down to users and groups, and\nin here you'll see that account we made.\n\n713\n00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,100\nAnd see how it shows administrator?\n\n714\n00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,700\nWe probably want to add a new account.\n\n715\n00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,860\nSo I'm just gonna hit the unlock\nbutton there in the plus.\n\n716\n00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,540\nAnd I'll add in a new account for\nmyself, right, Don Pezet and\n\n717\n00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,220\nI'll just make myself a standard user,\nright, nothing special there.\n\n718\n00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,040\nAnd I'm not gonna use iCloud for this one.\n\n719\n00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,220\nSo I'll punch in a password here locally.\n\n720\n00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,850\nI'll get that account created.\n\n721\n00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:13,130\nAnd now the computer is ready\nto turn over to the end user.\n\n722\n00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,610\nAnd I can tell the end user,\nhey, log in as Don Pezette.\n\n723\n00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,710\nHere's your password.\n\n724\n00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,310\nAnd now you've got access to your system.\n\n725\n00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:24,050\nNot too terribly a painful process\nto get it set up and installed.\n\n726\n00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:28,070\nNow for those of you that are interested,\nback in the ACA shows and\n\n727\n00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,340\nwe're gonna see this in the ACTC show.\n\n728\n00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:34,590\nWe can do automated employments of\nMac OS where it's preconfigured,\n\n729\n00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,230\nit's already got user accounts created or\n\n730\n00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,880\nit's already joined to a directory, it's\nalready got certain software installed.\n\n731\n00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,460\nYou can do some really cool\nautomated deployments.\n\n732\n00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,900\nWe're not going to cover that here,\nbut we will see that in later series.\n\n733\n00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,480\nOr if you're in a hurry, we already\ncovered that back in the ACA series so\n\n734\n00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,610\nyou can jump over and catch it there.\n\n735\n00:35:52,022 --> 00:35:55,980\nAll right, but as far as the install and\nthe upgrades go, that's it.\n\n736\n00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,090\nPretty straight forward process and\n\n737\n00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,530\nI don't think we did anything in here that\nwas rocket science or really challenging.\n\n738\n00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,690\nFor the most part it was clicking next a\nbunch of times and off you go, all right.\n\n739\n00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,910\nFor the exam and\ncouple of key things to remember,\n\n740\n00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,320\nupgrading to Yosemite remember\nthe minimum requirements right.\n\n741\n00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,900\nThat was covered in the first show.\n\n742\n00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,010\nThe second thing, remember that having\nthat installation media is really,\n\n743\n00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:20,550\nreally handy for doing clean installs,\npartitioned installs,\n\n744\n00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,290\nmanual upgrades like that, having that\ninstallation media is really convenient.\n\n745\n00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,710\nAnd we showed how to make\nthat in the first episode.\n\n746\n00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:30,310\nFor doing an upgrade though, most people\nare just gonna run the upgrade file.\n\n747\n00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,100\nDo an in place upgrade, you don't\nneed installation media for that.\n\n748\n00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,380\nYou just use the download\nlink in the App Store.\n\n749\n00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,230\nOff you go pretty straight forward there.\n\n750\n00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,640\nI also talked about\nthe migration assistant, right.\n\n751\n00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,000\nWe got a chance to see that where we could\nbring our data over from other Macs or\n\n752\n00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,840\nwe could bring it over from a Windows PC,\nright now functionality is there and\n\n753\n00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,580\nworks pretty well.\n\n754\n00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,940\nIt will help you get your data on\nthe new machine and get up and running.\n\n755\n00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,500\nNow Apple's trying to remove that\napprehension people have like how am I\n\n756\n00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,780\ngoing to buy a new computer cuz this\ncomputers built exactly the way I want it\n\n757\n00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,770\nwell, here's your chance to move\nthose settings over, and get running.\n\n758\n00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,490\nAll right.\n\n759\n00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:07,570\nWell, that's a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap up this show.\n\n760\n00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,550\nWe've covered installation and upgrading.\n\n761\n00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,180\nI know it wasn't the most\nterribly exciting thing.\n\n762\n00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,920\nWe are gonna see some neater things\nas they show progresses on, and\n\n763\n00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,550\nwe move into more advanced topics.\n\n764\n00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,990\nBut you gotta start somewhere.\n\n765\n00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,530\nInstallation upgrades\nare a great place for it.\n\n766\n00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,650\nAll right, let me remind you guys if\nyou have questions on any of this\n\n767\n00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,660\nyou are always welcome to ask.\n\n768\n00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,830\nLive during the show you can post\ninto our chat room at itpro.tv/live\n\n769\n00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,040\nyou'll

00:00:38,490\nWelcome back,\nto another episode of IT pro tv.\n\n4\n00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,510\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,848\nBack again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n6\n00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:47,980\nToday we're gonna be jumping\ninto operating system recovery,\n\n7\n00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,510\nwhich is one of those topics that we need\nto be aware of if we're supporting Macs,\n\n8\n00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,510\nbut hopefully we never have to use, right.\n\n9\n00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,740\nOS recovery, that means something\nis going wrong with Mac OS.\n\n10\n00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,640\nThings are not working the way\nthey're supposed to work, and\n\n11\n00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,520\nwe've got to find some way to recover it.\n\n12\n00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,750\nWell, to better understand this let's talk\nabout some of the symptoms that might be\n\n13\n00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,920\nleading to this type of needing, right.\n\n14\n00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,410\nMaybe you have a computer that's been\nrunning Yosemite for months or years.\n\n15\n00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,540\nThings have been running fine.\n\n16\n00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,040\nIn for a long time, and\n\n17\n00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,090\nall of a sudden you're starting to\nsee some erratic behavior, right.\n\n18\n00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,220\nMaybe certain files are missing\nfrom your hard drive that you\n\n19\n00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,760\nknow were there yesterday.\n\n20\n00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,970\nOr maybe the files there, but when you try\nand open them they're corrupted, right.\n\n21\n00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,680\nMaybe you're seeing that spinning color\nwheel a lot more than you used to.\n\n22\n00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,742\nJust throughout the day this constantly\nspinning color wheel really slow system,\n\n23\n00:01:39,742 --> 00:01:40,780\nall right.\n\n24\n00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,790\nMaybe your computer's\noccasionally freezing.\n\n25\n00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,150\nYou're working and all of a sudden\nit just stops responding and\n\n26\n00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,950\nyou have to re-boot, all right.\n\n27\n00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,180\nThese are all symptoms that could\nindicate a problem with MacOS.\n\n28\n00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,190\nAn actual operating system\nissue on your computer.\n\n29\n00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,780\nRight.\nNow those are the symptoms,\n\n30\n00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,840\nwhat are some of the causes?\n\n31\n00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,950\nWell, there's any number of\nthings that can cause this.\n\n32\n00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,800\nIt could be failing memory, right.\n\n33\n00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,190\nThe RAM sticks inside of your\ncomputer can go bad over time.\n\n34\n00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,420\nMore commonly though\nit's failing hard drive.\n\n35\n00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,304\nAs your hard drive starts to fail,\nyou'll lose one sector and\n\n36\n00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:14,780\nthen another sector and then another.\n\n37\n00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,780\nA hard drive never loses just one sector.\n\n38\n00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,810\nIt always starts to spread,\nand it gets worse and\n\n39\n00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,150\nworse and worse until the hard drive\nbecomes completely unreliable, all right.\n\n40\n00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,410\nWhat happens is, when Yosemite runs,\n\n41\n00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,720\nit tries to load its files\noff of the hard drive.\n\n42\n00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,690\nIf the files are bad on the hard drive,\nas soon as it reads them,\n\n43\n00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,010\nthey're already bad and\nit's not gonna work right.\n\n44\n00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,880\nIf it's the memory that's bad,\nwhen Yosemite reads a file off of the hard\n\n45\n00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,270\ndrive it copies it into\nRAM to work with it.\n\n46\n00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,890\nAnd so when it first copies it in\nthere it thinks everything's fine and\n\n47\n00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,960\nthen when it goes back to re-read the file\nfrom RAM, now the file is damaged in RAM.\n\n48\n00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,740\nRight.\n\n49\n00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,940\nThat's even harder to track down cuz\nthe error will usually be different every\n\n50\n00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,570\nsingle time.\n\n51\n00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,630\nIt's really difficult to track those down.\n\n52\n00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,790\nBut at the end of the day they really end\n\n53\n00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,630\nup causing a problem with\nthe operating system.\n\n54\n00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,880\nSo even if I go back and\nI fix the RAM chip, I replace it.\n\n55\n00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,420\nOr I replace the hard drive and\nI clone the drive over.\n\n56\n00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,510\nWhen I do that I may still have\ncorrupted files on the drive.\n\n57\n00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,220\nAnd so we need to be able to fix that,\nand that's where OS recovery comes in.\n\n58\n00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,647\nRight.\n\n59\n00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:17,322\nApple has a collection of utilities\nthat are available for us to try and\n\n60\n00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,787\nrecover systems that are experiencing\nthese kind of problems.\n\n61\n00:03:19,787 --> 00:03:21,714\nIf you can't boot your computer up.\n\n62\n00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:24,135\nIf you do boot up but it freezes a lot.\n\n63\n00:03:24,135 --> 00:03:24,953\nOr it locks up.\n\n64\n00:03:24,953 --> 00:03:26,102\nOr your files are missing.\n\n65\n00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:30,560\nWe need some way to be able to access\nour system to fix the problem.\n\n66\n00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,820\nThat doesn't require us using\nthe operating system that is the problem.\n\n67\n00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,460\nRight.\n\n68\n00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,860\nSo, we have a few mechanisms for\nit, and it's changed a good bit\n\n69\n00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,400\nover the years to try and become\na lot more simple than it used to be.\n\n70\n00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,010\nWell, inside of Yosemite the options are\nactually a little different than what we\n\n71\n00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,540\nhad before.\n\n72\n00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,340\nLet's cover the old way first.\n\n73\n00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,421\n[COUGH] In the olden days, right,\nunder lion, so it was really just two,\n\n74\n00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,970\nthree years ago.\n\n75\n00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,910\nUnder Mac OS X Lion, you actually have\nwhat was called the Recovery Assistant.\n\n76\n00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,065\nAnd if you never heard of this,\nlet me bring up the webpage for it here.\n\n77\n00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:05,100\n[COUGH] I've got Apple's page pulled up.\n\n78\n00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,630\nHere's their\nOS X: About Recovery Disk Assistant.\n\n79\n00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,290\nSo the Recovery Disk Assistant was\na little disk that you could make and you\n\n80\n00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,680\ncould burn it to a DVD, but more commonly\nyou used a USB thumb drive, right.\n\n81\n00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,555\nSo you take a little thumb\ndrive you format it,\n\n82\n00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:21,590\nyou throw the recovery\ndisk assistant on there.\n\n83\n00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:25,566\nAnd you boot the computer up, and\nit would boot this recovery menu.\n\n84\n00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,429\nAnd the recovery menu would let\nyou get to the disk utility.\n\n85\n00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:29,467\nIt would let you get to\nthe startup program.\n\n86\n00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:32,056\nYou will be able to modify what\ndisc was booting, things like that.\n\n87\n00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:34,285\nBasic tools you needed to recover system.\n\n88\n00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:35,927\nDoesn't really need all right.\n\n89\n00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:40,021\nBut if you go to build\na recovery disk assistant today,\n\n90\n00:04:40,021 --> 00:04:45,272\none of the things you'll notice is\nthat it sure does talk about Lion and\n\n91\n00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:48,800\nMountain Lion quite a bit, all right.\n\n92\n00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,770\nAnd it doesn't really mention Yosemite.\n\n93\n00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,270\nThe reason is, all of the utilities\nthat were present in the disk assistant\n\n94\n00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,380\nare now part of just the regular\ninstallation media for Yosemite.\n\n95\n00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,710\nSo if you've created an external\ninstallation media for\n\n96\n00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,140\nYosemite, you can boot off of that, and\n\n97\n00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,100\nyou have access to everything\nthe Recovery Disk Assistant did, too.\n\n98\n00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,010\nSo we don't really need a dedicated\nrecovery disk assistant for\n\n99\n00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,510\nYosemite or even Mavericks for\nthat matter.\n\n100\n00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,900\nSo if you read this article, and I'll post\nthe links for this in the show notes, but\n\n101\n00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,820\nif you read it and you get down to\nthe bottom, and you go to download\n\n102\n00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,960\nthe recovery assistant, you'll notice\nthat it's branded for Lion, all right.\n\n103\n00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,300\nAnd if you search Apple site, there is no,\n\n104\n00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,330\nYosemite or Mavericks download for\nit, all right.\n\n105\n00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,935\nSo you might ask yourself, well wait a\nminute Don, it was really nice having that\n\n106\n00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:45,730\nlittle media, that key that I could\npunch into a computer and boot from it.\n\n107\n00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,940\nNow I don't have that.\n\n108\n00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,010\nWell, you do right,\nit's just the install media.\n\n109\n00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,990\nYou make that installation media like\nwe showed in the very first episode of\n\n110\n00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,860\nthis series.\n\n111\n00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,879\nYou boot off of that and\nyou'll have access to the same utilities.\n\n112\n00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,970\nAll right.\nLet's go worst case scenario.\n\n113\n00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,080\nWhat if you didn't make\nthe installation media?\n\n114\n00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,820\nWell, that's the part where we're\nactually covered really well.\n\n115\n00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,000\nIf your mac is running Mavericks or\nYosemite,\n\n116\n00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,510\nright if you're in 10.9 or 10.10,\nwhen you bought that computer from Apple,\n\n117\n00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,070\nthey did two things to make it where\nyou shouldn't need that key, all right.\n\n118\n00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,370\nThe first thing is the recovery\nutility in that installation media\n\n119\n00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,410\nis actually a hidden partition on\nthe hard drive of your computer already.\n\n120\n00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,030\nRIght.\n\n121\n00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,210\nSo, it's already stored,\njust hidden on your computer.\n\n122\n00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,640\nAnd if you need to access recovery,\nyou don't need a USB key for it.\n\n123\n00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,940\nIt's right there on the drive.\n\n124\n00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,180\nSo if you had some memory that was going\nbad, and you've replaced the memory.\n\n125\n00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,540\nThey've fixed that, and now there's\nsome file corruption on your system, or\n\n126\n00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,620\nyour operating system files\nare a little corrupted.\n\n127\n00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,090\nWell you can just reboot your mac and\nboot your recovery.\n\n128\n00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,140\nThe way you do it by holding\ncommand R while you boot.\n\n129\n00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,340\nYou basically hit power on your keyboard\nwhile you’re holding command R and\n\n130\n00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,620\nyou wait until the little gray apple\nsymbol appears when you see that apple\n\n131\n00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,260\nlogo you can let go, and at that\npoint it’s gonna boot your recovery.\n\n132\n00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,300\nIt’ll look for that hidden partition on\nthe drive, and it will boot from that.\n\n133\n00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,190\nAll right, now in the official Apple\ntextbooks, in their information, they tell\n\n134\n00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,610\nus that the recovery partition is hidden\nand command R is the way you get to it.\n\n135\n00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,710\nBut I'll tell you in real life land,\nif you boot up your system and\n\n136\n00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,060\nyou just hold the Alt or the option key.\n\n137\n00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,320\nThe option key that we used to pick\nwhich partition we're gonna boot from,\n\n138\n00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,780\nyou'll find that on most computers\nit's not actually hidden.\n\n139\n00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,170\nIt's hidden when you\nfully boot into Mac OS.\n\n140\n00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,640\nBut when you hold the option key and\n\n141\n00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,980\nboot, you'll usually see it listed right\nalong with your other drives, right.\n\n142\n00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,680\nI use Boot Camp on my Mac.\n\n143\n00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,210\nSo when I boot up, I have my Mac partition\nand I've got my Windows partition.\n\n144\n00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,610\nAnd when I hold option and boot up for\n\n145\n00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,540\nthat, I see the recovery\npartition there also, right.\n\n146\n00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,360\nSo it's not always hidden.\n\n147\n00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,247\nBut on the exam, if you get any questions,\nyes, it's hidden, right.\n\n148\n00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:52,279\nThat's how it is in\nthe official text books.\n\n149\n00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,904\nIn real life, it's a little bit different.\n\n150\n00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:56,824\nSo, if you want to boot into recovery...\n\n151\n00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:59,384\nYou just hold Cmd+R while you boot.\n\n152\n00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:03,698\nCmd+R, push your power button,\nonce you see that grey logo, you let go,\n\n153\n00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:05,995\nand it's gonna boot to that recovery.\n\n154\n00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:06,510\nRight.\n\n155\n00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,900\nAnd when you get into it,\n\n156\n00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,380\nyou'll notice it's the same as if you\nbooted off of that install media.\n\n157\n00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,340\nYou'll get the same screens,\nthe same data, so there's no difference.\n\n158\n00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,790\nIt's just loaded locally on a drive.\n\n159\n00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,850\nNow, you might have spotted\nthe problem in this.\n\n160\n00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,690\nWhat if my hard drive fails?\n\n161\n00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,668\nIf my hard drive fails and\nmy data's corrupt on the hard drive.\n\n162\n00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:28,330\nAm I gonna be able to do command R\nto boot to the recovery partition?\n\n163\n00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,730\nWell, no.\n\n164\n00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,700\nIt's damaged.\n\n165\n00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,120\nIf you replaced it, now it's\na blank hard drive that's in there.\n\n166\n00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,410\nYou don't have the recovery partition.\n\n167\n00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:34,910\nIt's gone.\n\n168\n00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,990\nOr if somebody got creative and\n\n169\n00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,680\nwent into disk utility and\nwiped out the recovery partition.\n\n170\n00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,180\nHate it when people do that.\n\n171\n00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,710\nIf they wiped it out, it's gone.\n\n172\n00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,880\nThat command R is not going to work for\nyou.\n\n173\n00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,280\nSo what do you do there?\n\n174\n00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,080\nWell all the newer Macs if your Macs\nship with Mavericks or Yosemite,\n\n175\n00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,420\nit's pretty much a guarantee\nthat it's on there.\n\n176\n00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,070\nBut even if it was running Lion or\n\n177\n00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,110\nMountain Lion as long as you've\ndone all of your updates.\n\n178\n00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,420\nWait let me clarify this.\n\n179\n00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,610\nThe Lion one's won't do it.\n\n180\n00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,400\nBut the Mountain Lion one.\n\n181\n00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,790\nIf your systems ship with Mountain Lion\nand you've done all your updates.\n\n182\n00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,530\nThey've actually added support for\n\n183\n00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,490\na neat feature,\nwhich is called internet recovery.\n\n184\n00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,580\nDo I have that.\n\n185\n00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,150\nDo I have that webpage pulled up here?\n\n186\n00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,690\nI may or may not.\n\n187\n00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:19,800\nOh, yes, yes I do.\n\n188\n00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,140\nAll right. Here.\nSo I've got Apple's page pulled up for it.\n\n189\n00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,010\nThis is on their regular recovery page,\nwhere it talks about OSX recovery.\n\n190\n00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,340\nThey talk about command R.\n\n191\n00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:27,850\nRight there, right.\n\n192\n00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,790\nYou press that while you boot but\nthey all so talk about internet recovery.\n\n193\n00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,990\nIf you boot a modern Mac,\nreally any Mac made in the last two\n\n194\n00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,620\nyears should be like this,\nif it has a completely blank hard drive,\n\n195\n00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,260\nthe bios of the mac will\nlook to the internet.\n\n196\n00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,100\nIt will look for a network connection,\nit will reach out there\n\n197\n00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,010\nacross the internet and it will load\nrecovery right from Apple servers.\n\n198\n00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,000\nSo you can have a completely blank hard\ndrive and it'll still load recovery.\n\n199\n00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,030\nNow it does require internet access.\n\n200\n00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,700\nIf you have a physical network jack\non your Apple and it's plugged in,\n\n201\n00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,650\nit'll detect that and it'll run just fine.\n\n202\n00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,640\nBut if you're on a laptop like mine that\ndoesn't have a physical network jack,\n\n203\n00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,760\nwell I guess I could throw my\nThunderbolt adapter on there, right.\n\n204\n00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,070\nBut, if you don't it'll\ndisplay a wireless screen and\n\n205\n00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,800\nlet you pick your wireless network.\n\n206\n00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,290\nThe bias actually has\nthe wireless selection utility.\n\n207\n00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,550\nSo you can connect to a wireless network\nand then it will reach out to Apple and\n\n208\n00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,000\nit will load recovery right from them.\n\n209\n00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,920\nThat's why Apple doesn't make the recovery\ndisk assistant for Yosemite and Mavericks.\n\n210\n00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,710\nThat's what we don't have that.\n\n211\n00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,290\nThat's why when you go to download it,\n\n212\n00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,470\nyou just see a lion because\nyou don't need it anymore.\n\n213\n00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,190\nSo on the newer systems\nyou just boot with CMD-R.\n\n214\n00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,160\nAnd if the hard drive is intact,\nit'll load recovery from the hard drive.\n\n215\n00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,860\nIf the hard drive is not intact,\nit'll reach out to Apple and\n\n216\n00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,730\nit'll load recovery from Apple.\n\n217\n00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,580\nAssuming you have an internet connection.\n\n218\n00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,430\nIf the hard drive is not intact and\nyou don't have an Internet connection.\n\n219\n00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,030\nThen you're kind of in\ntrouble at that point.\n\n220\n00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,230\nThat's where you need\nthat installation media.\n\n221\n00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,440\nYou make that USB key with\nthat installation media and\n\n222\n00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,610\nyou boot off of that.\n\n223\n00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,580\nIf you don't have any of those\nit's time to hop in your car and\n\n224\n00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,380\ndrive down to your local Apple store.\n\n225\n00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,290\nThey can fix it pretty quickly for\nyou right there.\n\n226\n00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,980\nThose are the options we have available.\n\n227\n00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,380\nRegardless of which method we use when\nyou boot a computer into recovery,\n\n228\n00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,540\nyou're gonna see something a little bit\ndifferent than the normal installer.\n\n229\n00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,890\nEven if you're using the installation\nmedia, it's gonna look different.\n\n230\n00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,990\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n231\n00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:28,980\nI've got a, well, shoot,\nI thought I had a system booted up.\n\n232\n00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,730\nHere we go.\nI've\n\n233\n00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,640\ngot the systems booted up\ninto recovery right here.\n\n234\n00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,540\nLet me see if I can make\nthis a little bigger.\n\n235\n00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,710\nI don't know if it's going\nto respond to this too well.\n\n236\n00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,090\nIt's a little bit bigger.\n\n237\n00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,300\nHere I have the system\nbooted into recovery.\n\n238\n00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,120\nAnd when you boot up,\nyou're going to see a message like this.\n\n239\n00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,930\nAnd it says, to set up the installation\nof OS X, press continue.\n\n240\n00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,680\nWell, I don't want to do an install,\nright?\n\n241\n00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,580\nWell, you actually could choose to\ndo an install if you wanted, and\n\n242\n00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,840\nit'll replace the operating system files,\nbut we don't necessarily want that.\n\n243\n00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,710\nWe might want to use some\nother troubleshooting tools.\n\n244\n00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,140\nAnd it tells you right here,\nto repair your disk using Disk Utility,\n\n245\n00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,980\nrestore your computer from Time Machine\nbackup, and so on, use the menu up top.\n\n246\n00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,750\nAnd you'd be surprised how many people\nnever even noticed the menu up top.\n\n247\n00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,440\nWhen you boot to recovery.\n\n248\n00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,760\nYou got a menu up here, and\n\n249\n00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,131\nunder the menu you'll see a Utilities\nmenu that you can drop down.\n\n250\n00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:20,627\nYou can try and drop down.\n\n251\n00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:21,451\nThere we go.\n\n252\n00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:26,455\nYou'll see a couple of neat utilities that\nare right here that we have access to.\n\n253\n00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,065\nOkay?\n\n254\n00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:31,245\nSo if you're just trying to see if\ncertain files are there on the system,\n\n255\n00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:32,625\nyou could fire up Terminal.\n\n256\n00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:36,085\nAnd jump in there and browse the files,\nreset file permissions,\n\n257\n00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:38,555\ndo all the various things that\nyou can do from the terminal.\n\n258\n00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:41,055\nAnd you can do this\nwithout doing a reinstall.\n\n259\n00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,050\nYou can go into the disk utility and\n\n260\n00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,580\nyou can check to make sure\nyour disks are present.\n\n261\n00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,820\nAnd if they aren't present\nyou can format them but\n\n262\n00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,800\nif they are present you can check and\nsee if they need a repair, right.\n\n263\n00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,080\nNow this is a pretty common one for me.\n\n264\n00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,810\nI'll go into disk utility and\nI'll pick the disk.\n\n265\n00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,830\nSo, maybe i'll take operating\nsystem hard drive here.\n\n266\n00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,060\nSo, I'll pick it.\n\n267\n00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,150\nAnd then down here you'll see\nverify disk and repair disk.\n\n268\n00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,330\nVerify disk permissions and\nrepair disk permissions.\n\n269\n00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,060\nSo if I think there's\nsome corruption on there.\n\n270\n00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,910\nI can do a quick scan.\n\n271\n00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,590\nI'll hit verify disk and it will scan it.\n\n272\n00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,295\nAnd if it sees corruption on there it\nwill tell me, ooh, there's some problems.\n\n273\n00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:19,545\nWe need to run a repair.\n\n274\n00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:23,455\nThis repair button will light up and\nI'll be able to hit the repair, all right.\n\n275\n00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:25,415\nSame thing goes for permissions.\n\n276\n00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:29,555\nUsually the permission errors will kick in\nbefore the file errors, so that's where\n\n277\n00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:32,705\nyou'll see your problem first, but\nin my case, everything tested out okay.\n\n278\n00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:33,825\nI can still hit repair.\n\n279\n00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:35,635\nIt's not going to do anything,\nbut I can hit it.\n\n280\n00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,190\nI'm can verify disk permissions.\n\n281\n00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,140\nI'm just going to check to make sure\npermissions are set properly there.\n\n282\n00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,610\nAnd, if they are,\nthen I won't need to do anything.\n\n283\n00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,580\nIf they aren't I can hit repair disk\npermissions, and it will fix those.\n\n284\n00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,880\nQuick and easy, then I just boot\nmy computer up like normal, and\n\n285\n00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,980\nI'm back in business.\n\n286\n00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,780\nRight?\nThat's\n\n287\n00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,340\npart of what the recovery\npartition gives us access to.\n\n288\n00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,200\nAnd that recovery disk assistant was\nwhat we used back in the lion days,\n\n289\n00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,920\nthe early mountain lion days\nto be able to boot up and\n\n290\n00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,750\naccess them, assuming that you didn't\nhave media installation handy.\n\n291\n00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,930\nSo, it's going to run around and\ncheck all that stuff.\n\n292\n00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,530\nNow, in the meantime,\nsee how if I move this out of the way,\n\n293\n00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,520\nthe installer has kind of disappeared.\n\n294\n00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,650\nAs soon as this is done, I'll be able\nto go back to the installer, and\n\n295\n00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,910\nI got some other options there\nthat I want to point out too.\n\n296\n00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,100\nAnd I guess while I'm waiting on this, I\nguess I'm kind of trapped in this utility,\n\n297\n00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,930\nso I'm stuck waiting.\n\n298\n00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,410\nLet's talk about some of the other things.\n\n299\n00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,880\nIf I drop to the terminal, I can access\nother volumes that are on my system, I can\n\n300\n00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,830\nbrowse around and look for files, I can do\nquick backups if I want from the terminal,\n\n301\n00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,590\nso there's some flexibility there.\n\n302\n00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,640\nThere was also an other menu item that\nwe haven't talked about in any of our\n\n303\n00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,630\nshows yet.\n\n304\n00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,480\nIt was the firmware password utility.\n\n305\n00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,560\nYou can set a firmware password on\nyour Mac so when someone pushes power,\n\n306\n00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,750\nthey have to provide a password before\nit even loads the operating system.\n\n307\n00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,210\nIt doesn't even load the OS.\n\n308\n00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,720\nYou have to provide a firmware password.\n\n309\n00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,100\nIf somebody sets one of those, or\n\n310\n00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,050\nif you want to set one, you can use\nthat firmware password utility.\n\n311\n00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:11,080\nYou can use it to reset the password as\nwell as to change it to something else or\n\n312\n00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,885\ndisable it.\n\n313\n00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:15,035\nTurn it on, turn it off, you do all that\nfrom that firmware password utility.\n\n314\n00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:17,025\nIt's a pretty nice thing to have.\n\n315\n00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:19,035\nIt kicks in, like if you boot the Mac and\n\n316\n00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:21,535\nyou hold down the alt key\nto get to drive selection\n\n317\n00:15:21,535 --> 00:15:25,215\nyou still have to do your firmware\npassword to be able to access that screen.\n\n318\n00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:29,685\nSo it stops people from bypassing your\nOS and booting from removable media or\n\n319\n00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:30,265\nsomething like that.\n\n320\n00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:38,390\nSo If you guys are familiar with the whole\nEdward Snowden data leak that happened.\n\n321\n00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,820\nRight?\nHe was the private contractor here in\n\n322\n00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,570\nthe US that leaked a ton\nof government data.\n\n323\n00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,910\nIf they had had a firmware\npassword on a Mac.\n\n324\n00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,690\nIf that was the system they were using,\nwhat.\n\n325\n00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,000\nWhat he did wouldn't have been possible.\n\n326\n00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,660\nCuz he booted off of a disk to load\nhis own private OS to send data out.\n\n327\n00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,468\nSo these are simple precautions that we\ncan take to protect from things like that.\n\n328\n00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:58,132\nNow in his case, I think he was on a PC.\n\n329\n00:15:58,132 --> 00:15:59,839\nAnd they don't really have\nthis functionality in a PC.\n\n330\n00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,586\nSo.\nNot quite the same.\n\n331\n00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,490\nAll right, so it finished.\n\n332\n00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,243\nIt finished it's little permissions check.\n\n333\n00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:07,740\nLooks like everything came back good.\n\n334\n00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,270\nWe did get some differences.\n\n335\n00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,560\nSo it found where my user differs\non certain folders in here, and\n\n336\n00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,510\nit looks like my display policy.\n\n337\n00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,140\nSo there's something that's not quite\nright for permissions that it found.\n\n338\n00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,930\nI can go ahead and hit Repair\nDispermissions, and it will fix those.\n\n339\n00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,990\nSo we'll let it repair.\n\n340\n00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,320\nThe repair should happen pretty quick.\n\n341\n00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,100\nI say that, and then it tells me\nit's gonna take one minute, but\n\n342\n00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,720\nit'll run through and fix those.\n\n343\n00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,880\nRemember that underneath\nthe hood in Mac OS,\n\n344\n00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,890\nit's running BSD which is a Unix\nbased operating system, and\n\n345\n00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,140\nUnix based operating systems are made\nup of millions of little files.\n\n346\n00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,730\nAnd so these file operations can\ntake a while because of that,\n\n347\n00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,660\njust the sheer quantity of files.\n\n348\n00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,510\nSo we'll let that run while it repairs.\n\n349\n00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,550\nI could stop it but I don't want to\ndamage my system and make it not boot.\n\n350\n00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,270\nYou'll see it's just going through and\n\n351\n00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:58,360\nrepairing those four different\nfolders it identified up there.\n\n352\n00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,660\nAnd as soon as they're done,\nwe'll be ready to rock.\n\n353\n00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,080\nNow what I want to do after this,\nis after I get out of the Disk Utility,\n\n354\n00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,300\nI'm gonna go and hit the install\nbutton like I'm gonna do an install.\n\n355\n00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,940\nBut when we do an install,\nthe options are a little bit\n\n356\n00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,210\ndifferent as far what we want to achieve\nthan when we do a normal install, and\n\n357\n00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,200\nthat's what I want to highlight.\n\n358\n00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,750\nOh, here.\nIt just finished.\n\n359\n00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,720\nAll right.\nSo it finished repairing\n\n360\n00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,280\nthose permissions.\n\n361\n00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,750\nAnd I'll just get out of the Disk Utility.\n\n362\n00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,540\nOnce I'm out of the Disk Utility,\nI'm back into my installer.\n\n363\n00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,850\nAnd up here under the Utilities menu,\n\n364\n00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,740\nthere's that firmware password\nutility I was talking about.\n\n365\n00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,530\nSo you can jump in there and\nturn the password on.\n\n366\n00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,440\nTurn the password off.\n\n367\n00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,300\nIt's all right there.\n\n368\n00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,410\nI am going to hit continue though.\n\n369\n00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,240\nAnd I'll sign off on my\nlicense agreement again.\n\n370\n00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,630\nThis gets a little repetitive.\n\n371\n00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,620\nAll right.\n\n372\n00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,710\nAnd now it's asking me what\ndisk I want to install on and\n\n373\n00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,100\nI see all these different disks, right?\n\n374\n00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,920\nI've got my operating system hard drive,\nmy user data hard drive, my installer,\n\n375\n00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,622\nI don't want to go there.\n\n376\n00:17:49,622 --> 00:17:53,430\nI'm gonna pick the operating system\nhard drive and I'll hit continue, and\n\n377\n00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,890\non this next screen it's\ngoing to start the install.\n\n378\n00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,590\nNow, when I started that install,\nam I about to lose all my data?\n\n379\n00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,180\nWell no, what it's actually doing is\n\n380\n00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,800\nreplacing all of\nthe operating system files.\n\n381\n00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,670\nIf any of the operating\nsystem files we damaged,\n\n382\n00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,530\nit's gonna replace those with good clean\nones right out of our recovery partition.\n\n383\n00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,110\nAll right?\n\n384\n00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,230\nOr from our reinstallation media\nif that's where we're coming from.\n\n385\n00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,430\nSo it's gonna replace those and\nget them in place.\n\n386\n00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,210\nAll right so\nwe'll leave that one churning along.\n\n387\n00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,460\nAnd I do wanna show you\nguys one more thing.\n\n388\n00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,230\nRight there I did\nthe boot off of recovery.\n\n389\n00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,160\nLet me show you what happens if you\nboot up the installation media.\n\n390\n00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,480\nWhen you boot off the installation\nmedia it detects that you've\n\n391\n00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,480\nalready got an OS on the drive and\nit changes the menu items a little bit.\n\n392\n00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,600\nIn the previous episode I showed doing\nan install in a new machine, and\n\n393\n00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,500\nwe booted off the installation media and\ndid the whole install.\n\n394\n00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,100\nBut I didn't dive into all the different\nmenu items because we weren't\n\n395\n00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,610\ntalking about recovery then.\n\n396\n00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,400\nWhen it comes to recovery for me, I almost\nalways boot off of the installation media\n\n397\n00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,150\nbecause it's got some\nneat utilities in there.\n\n398\n00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,250\nSo let me show you those\nright here on this machine.\n\n399\n00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,890\nSo here's another machine that I\nbooted off my installation media.\n\n400\n00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,480\nI popped my USB key in there I held\ndown my Alt key while I booted, and\n\n401\n00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,330\nI chose this installation\nmedia to boot from.\n\n402\n00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,140\nAnd when it came up, I get this menu here.\n\n403\n00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,560\nActually, I'm lying.\n\n404\n00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,500\nI did hold down Cmd+R\nwhen I booted this one.\n\n405\n00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,030\nSo I held down Cmd+R and\nit booted off that installation media.\n\n406\n00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,160\nBut what you'll see are some\nslightly different menu items.\n\n407\n00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,390\nNow Disk Utility, right, Get Help Online.\n\n408\n00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,570\nThose are ones that we saw\nbefore in earlier episodes, but\n\n409\n00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,770\nhere I've got restore from time machine,\nand reinstall OS X.\n\n410\n00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,370\nRestore from time machine, that's going\nto basically allow to hook up an external\n\n411\n00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,190\nhard drive and recover our date,\nbringing in our system from that way.\n\n412\n00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,220\nReinstall OS X, that's going to copy\nover our operating system files and\n\n413\n00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,560\nput them in place so\nwe can boot our system.\n\n414\n00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:49,840\nSo we've got that option here and\nit says, reinstall a new copy of OS X.\n\n415\n00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,430\nBut it is installing on top of your\nexisting copy, if you want to do a true\n\n416\n00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,010\nreinstall you need to go to disk\nutility and format your drive first.\n\n417\n00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,710\nThat way it doesn't\nbring in your old data.\n\n418\n00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,760\nSome of the other things that\nare different is if I go up\n\n419\n00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,850\nunder the utilities menu, notice how\nI've got my Firmware Password Utility,\n\n420\n00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,900\nI've got Terminal, but\nI've also got Network Utility.\n\n421\n00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,830\nI didn't see the Network Utility a few\nmoments ago because I was booting to\n\n422\n00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,150\nrecover off a local hard drive so\nit didn't need network access.\n\n423\n00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,430\nThen here it's got the network utility.\n\n424\n00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,020\nAnd I can go into that, and\nit lets you do some simple tests.\n\n425\n00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,000\nYou can see if you're\ngetting an IP address,\n\n426\n00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,600\nyou can do pings, lookups, trace routes.\n\n427\n00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,490\nSo you've got a few options here to be\nable to check your network connectivity,\n\n428\n00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,710\nwhich can be pretty handy too.\n\n429\n00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,960\nSo there's a lot of neat\nutilities that are built in here\n\n430\n00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,590\nto help with recovery of the system.\n\n431\n00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,030\nBut for most of us, we're really\ngoing to be doing one of two things.\n\n432\n00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,500\nEither reinstalling OS X to repair\nour operating system files, or\n\n433\n00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,900\nrestoring from Time Machine\nto repair our files, right?\n\n434\n00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,290\nIf there is disk corruption, it probably\nhasn't just affected the operating system.\n\n435\n00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,510\nIt's probably affected your\npersonal files too, so\n\n436\n00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,510\nrestoring from Time Machine\nis one of the best options.\n\n437\n00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,430\nAnd just a personal word of advice,\nyou never\n\n438\n00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,000\nwant to rely on a hard drive that's\ntested with a failure at some point.\n\n439\n00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,580\nIf a hard drive had a single sector fail,\nwell Mac OS is smart it will flag it as\n\n440\n00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,430\nbad sector and it won't write to it\nanymore, it will write to other sectors.\n\n441\n00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,820\nBut you never have just one sector fail,\nit will start to spread,\n\n442\n00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,020\nit may not spread right away it may\ntake a few days, weeks, months.\n\n443\n00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,340\nBut it will spread and\nthat drive will fail.\n\n444\n00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,780\nBetter to replace it on your\nschedule than to replace it\n\n445\n00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,020\nwhenever that hard drive chooses to fail\nand you know you are busy at work and\n\n446\n00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,380\nyou're trying to get things done and\nthe hard drive is dead.\n\n447\n00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,860\nAll right, so better to replace\nthose things ahead of time.\n\n448\n00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,000\nAll right so recovering our systems,\npretty straight forward.\n\n449\n00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,430\nA lot of good stuff is built in.\n\n450\n00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,350\nSo let me just recap these.\n\n451\n00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:42,680\nFor Mountain Lion and earlier we\nhave the recovery disk assistant.\n\n452\n00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,560\nWe download that utility from Apple.\n\n453\n00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,310\nYou run it.\n\n454\n00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,660\nYou point it at a USBP and\nit will make your recovery disk assistant.\n\n455\n00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,050\nThat's good for Mountain Lion and earlier.\n\n456\n00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,050\nFor mavericks and\nYosemite boot with command R.\n\n457\n00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,120\nThe recovery partition is\nalready on the hard drive.\n\n458\n00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,420\nIf the hard drive is damaged\nwe have Internet recovery.\n\n459\n00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,020\nYou boot holding Cmd+R, it won't\nfind recovery on the hard drive and\n\n460\n00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,160\nit'll go out to the Internet instead.\n\n461\n00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,220\nAnd pull it right from Apple.\n\n462\n00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,490\nAll right.\n\n463\n00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,100\nThen the other option was to boot from\nthe installation media which was the last\n\n464\n00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,010\nthing that I did.\n\n465\n00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,270\nI booted with Cmd+R with\nthe installation media in and\n\n466\n00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,480\nit pulled the recovery\npartition from there.\n\n467\n00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,650\nAnd I've got the option\nto reinstall DOS and\n\n468\n00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,410\nall the various other things that we need.\n\n469\n00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,050\nAll right.\n\n470\n00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,480\nRemember that if you're doing Internet\nrecovery and it's connecting to Apple and\n\n471\n00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,770\ndo reinstall DOS, it's over five gigs\nof data that it's gotta download and\n\n472\n00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,680\nthat's gonna take a while.\n\n473\n00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680\nIf you're doing it off of\nyour installation media,\n\n474\n00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,980\nit's much faster and so\nthat's what I recommend.\n\n475\n00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,420\nBut for the exam, you need to be familiar\nwith each of the different options and\n\n476\n00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,500\nthose are what we've just seen.\n\n477\n00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,420\nAll right.\nAlso\n\n478\n00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,160\nkeep in mind that there's always that\nmenu bar up at the top of the screen.\n\n479\n00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,060\nSo if you don't see an option\nin the utilities that are being\n\n480\n00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,220\ndisplayed in the main part of the screen,\nlook up to the menu.\n\n481\n00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,750\nRight?\nUp in the menu you'll have that utilities\n\n482\n00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,460\ndrop down and there's more\nstuff stashed away under there.\n\n483\n00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,690\nAll right.\n\n484\n00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,210\nSo that's basically it for OS recovery.\n\n485\n00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,510\nNot a terribly difficult thing.\n\n486\n00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,720\nIn typical Apple style they try\nto make it easy and painless.\n\n487\n00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,772\nAnd in this case, it is.\n\n488\n00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:11,530\nAll right, well let me remind you guys,\n\n489\n00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,917\nif you

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,800\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,342\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\n\n7\n00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:44,470\nback again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n8\n00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,758\nNow, in our previous episodes we've\nbeen taking a look at getting Yosemite\n\n9\n00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:53,180\ninstalled on a new Mac, or on an existing\nMac, and we took a look at upgrades and\n\n10\n00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,180\nclean installs and so on.\n\n11\n00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,710\nAnd what we want to take a look at now,\n\n12\n00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,640\nis the initial configuration that we\nperform once a system is installed.\n\n13\n00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,960\nSo, once we've installed Yosemite,\nthe default out of the box experience,\n\n14\n00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,720\nit may be okay for us, but there might\nbe some things that we need to tweak.\n\n15\n00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,270\nAnd so Apple, for the exam objectives,\n\n16\n00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,120\nthey call out a couple of specific\nareas we need to address.\n\n17\n00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,620\nThe first area is migrating our user data.\n\n18\n00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,950\nWe might have an old computer\nthat we're replacing.\n\n19\n00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,960\nWe need to get our user data off of it,\nright?\n\n20\n00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,080\nIf we did an upgrade, then we've already\ngot our user data here, we skip this step.\n\n21\n00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,101\nBut if our user data was an an old\ncomputer or a separate system,\n\n22\n00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:33,010\nwe need to go and gather the data\nfrom there and bring it over.\n\n23\n00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,720\nSo that's gonna require a little bit\nof extra effort on our part, right?\n\n24\n00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,290\nNow that's one part of the mix of\nwhat we're going to see today.\n\n25\n00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,010\nThe other things that Apple calls\nout are configuring networking.\n\n26\n00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,640\nWe need to get our Mac connected to the\nnetwork so we can do automatic updates and\n\n27\n00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,260\nbrowse the Internet.\n\n28\n00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,400\nWe also need to create user accounts.\n\n29\n00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,130\nIf we had separate user accounts on our\nsystem before we'll need them now, or\n\n30\n00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,690\nif this is a new machine we may choose\nto create those separate user accounts.\n\n31\n00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,340\nI know in the installation episode\nI created a generic account\n\n32\n00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,870\ncalled Help Desk.\n\n33\n00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,140\nSo I probably need to come back and\ncreate more user accounts for\n\n34\n00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,050\neach of the users that\nare gonna login to the system.\n\n35\n00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,240\nAnother thing we need to do is just\nto adjust our general preferences, so\n\n36\n00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,327\nwe're gonna take a little tour of\nthe System Preferences screen, and\n\n37\n00:02:13,327 --> 00:02:15,130\nwhat some of those general settings do.\n\n38\n00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,420\nAnd then lastly we're gonna\ntalk about software updates.\n\n39\n00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,786\nApple is really good about pushing out\nsecurity fixes and software updates for\n\n40\n00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:25,407\ntheir software, you need to make sure\nthat's enabled, that you're doing that and\n\n41\n00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:27,710\nletting those automatic checks and\nupdates happen.\n\n42\n00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,660\nThey're all important pieces\nof setting up a new computer.\n\n43\n00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:37,470\nAll right, well let's start off with\nmigrating our data from another system.\n\n44\n00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,104\nIf you had an old Mac, and\nyou just bought a new one,\n\n45\n00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:42,510\nyou need to be able to\nget your data moved over.\n\n46\n00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,837\nOr if you're coming from the Windows\nworld and you have a Windows 7 machine or\n\n47\n00:02:45,837 --> 00:02:46,810\nsomething like that,\n\n48\n00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,910\nand you want to bring your data over and\nthrow it onto the new one.\n\n49\n00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,370\nWell, we've got a simple process that\nenables us to do both of those and\n\n50\n00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,240\nit's called the Migration Assistant.\n\n51\n00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,120\nIn the initial episodes that we\ndid where we were installing,\n\n52\n00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,630\nyou guys saw the Migration Assistant and\n\n53\n00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,300\nI think I just skipped past it,\nI think I said Don't Migrate Data.\n\n54\n00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,020\nWell, the Migration Assistant does run\n\n55\n00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,370\nthe first time you boot\nafter doing an install.\n\n56\n00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,230\nBut that's not the only time you can run\nit, you can run it whenever you want.\n\n57\n00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,990\nIt's actually tucked away inside\nof your Applications folder\n\n58\n00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,480\nin the Utilities folder.\n\n59\n00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,400\nSo the Migration Assistant is there,\nwe can call it up and fire it at any time.\n\n60\n00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,093\nAnd you can run it more than once,\nmaybe you had more than one old Mac and\n\n61\n00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:26,425\nyou want to bring all of that data\ninto a single new one, right?\n\n62\n00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,710\nSo you can run the Migration Assistant\nmore than once and\n\n63\n00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,175\npoint to those different systems.\n\n64\n00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:32,005\nIt's a pretty neat little process.\n\n65\n00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:37,845\nNow, when you run the Migration Assistant,\nit will log you out of your Mac.\n\n66\n00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:40,824\nSo if you are in the middle of doing\nsomething, you've got a bunch of documents\n\n67\n00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:42,922\nopen, make sure you save them\nfirst before you run it.\n\n68\n00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,204\nBut otherwise you'll run it, and\nit'll take you into this separate,\n\n69\n00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:49,543\nit's like a special user space where\nthe Migration Assistant runs, and\n\n70\n00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:51,800\nyou'll be able to gather your data,\nall right?\n\n71\n00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,550\nSo I want to show that to you guys.\n\n72\n00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,863\nAnd to do that, what I've got is here\nis a Yosemite install that I did this\n\n73\n00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:01,920\nmorning that is stock,\nI haven't done anything to mess with this.\n\n74\n00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,470\nI installed Yosemite and during the\ninstall I created that Help Desk account,\n\n75\n00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,260\njust like we did in that previous show.\n\n76\n00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,970\nSo here's a stock install that doesn't\nhave any of my settings, all right.\n\n77\n00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,680\nMeanwhile, right here\nI've got my old machine.\n\n78\n00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,240\nAnd this is running Mavericks,\nand it's got some customizations.\n\n79\n00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,540\nI've got my autobiography\nsitting here on the desktop,\n\n80\n00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,830\nwhich is the shortest autobiography ever.\n\n81\n00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,380\nWe've got a couple of\ncustom apps installed.\n\n82\n00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,490\nI've got my Write app installed down here.\n\n83\n00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,800\nI've got my Space wallpaper set, right?\n\n84\n00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,330\nSo, a couple of different\nthings going on here.\n\n85\n00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,080\nThis system has been customized.\n\n86\n00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,180\nWell, when I move to my new Mac,\nI don't want to have to redo all\n\n87\n00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,700\nthe customizations that I did, so\nI want to use the Migration Assistant.\n\n88\n00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,960\nNow the Migration Assistant\nhas two pieces.\n\n89\n00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,090\nThere's the source machine,\nthat's the machine that has your data.\n\n90\n00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,910\nAnd then there's the target machine,\n\n91\n00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,640\nthat's your new machine\nthat doesn't have the data.\n\n92\n00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,660\nYour target is always going to be\nYosemite, it's the new system.\n\n93\n00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,480\nSo I'm gonna go to my target and\nI'm gonna run that Migration Assistant.\n\n94\n00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,940\nNow if this is the first time I booted,\nit's already running.\n\n95\n00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,750\nBut if it's not the first time I've\nbooted, I just need to launch it.\n\n96\n00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,473\nAnd I can fire up my Finder, and\nI can go to Applications, and\n\n97\n00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:16,980\nI can find that Utilities folder in here.\n\n98\n00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,690\nAnd the Migration Assistant\nis sitting right here, right?\n\n99\n00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,870\nSo I'll go ahead and\nfire up that Migration Assistant, and\n\n100\n00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,830\nit's just gonna let me\nknow that it's gonna run.\n\n101\n00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,380\nIt says, All other apps will\nquit when you click Continue.\n\n102\n00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,120\nThat's that warning that\nit's gonna log us out.\n\n103\n00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,858\nAnd when I hit Continue, it's prompting\nfor administrative privileges, so\n\n104\n00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:35,340\nI'll give it my credentials.\n\n105\n00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,090\nAnd then it's gonna close everything and\ndump out to the Migration Assistant.\n\n106\n00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,870\nNow I'm up and\nI'm running the Migration Assistant.\n\n107\n00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,850\nNow it can bring data in from\nseveral different places.\n\n108\n00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,020\nI've already mentioned two.\n\n109\n00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,310\nIt can bring it in from another Mac,\nor it can bring it in from a PC.\n\n110\n00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,240\nBut there's actually a couple of\nother options that are in here.\n\n111\n00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,990\nWell, From a Windows PC,\nthat's all by itself.\n\n112\n00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,890\nNotice there's To another Mac.\n\n113\n00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:07,330\nThat's what you would pick on\nthe source machine, not on the target.\n\n114\n00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,650\nBut I'm on the target.\n\n115\n00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,480\nAnd so I can say From a Windows PC or\nFrom a Mac.\n\n116\n00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,310\nAnd if I say From a Mac, there's\nactually some other stuff listed here.\n\n117\n00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,390\nTime machine backup and startup disk.\n\n118\n00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,790\nSo what is all that?\n\n119\n00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:23,400\nWell, if I have another Mac and it's\non the same network as my current one,\n\n120\n00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,100\nso I've got my old Mac and my new Mac.\n\n121\n00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,220\nIf they're both on the same network,\nI can choose this.\n\n122\n00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,140\nThey'll find each other over the network,\nand copy my data over.\n\n123\n00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,640\nIt's the easiest way to do it.\n\n124\n00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,870\nThey can both be on\nthe same wireless network.\n\n125\n00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,770\nOr one can be on a wired network, and\none can be a on a wireless network.\n\n126\n00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,565\nAs long as it's the same IP subnet,\nthey'll find each other and communicate.\n\n127\n00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:49,140\nBut, what if you've got two Macs and\nthey're not on the same network?\n\n128\n00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,660\nWhat if one of them\nisn't booting up right?\n\n129\n00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,220\nOne's kind of failing so\nit's not connecting to the network.\n\n130\n00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,950\nWell, there's a few other options for us.\n\n131\n00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,640\nIf they both have a valid network cable or\na network card in them, you can use\n\n132\n00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,920\nan Ethernet crossover cable and just\nplug directly between the two computers.\n\n133\n00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,290\nYou plug one cable into the new Mac and\none cable into the old Mac, and\n\n134\n00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,920\nthey'll find each other\nover that crossover cable.\n\n135\n00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,240\nKeep in mind that a normal network cable,\n\n136\n00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,850\na normal Ethernet patch cable\nwill not work for that.\n\n137\n00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,650\nWhen you go computer-to-computer\nit's gotta be a crossover cable.\n\n138\n00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,410\nYou can also do FireWire.\n\n139\n00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,480\nIf both of your Macs,\nyour new one and your old one,\n\n140\n00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,170\nhave FireWire connectors on them,\nyou can run a FireWire cable from one\n\n141\n00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,950\nto the other, and they'll find each\nother over the FireWire connection.\n\n142\n00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,630\nThere is a third option which is a cool\none, and this is the startup disk one.\n\n143\n00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,100\nIf I can just make the hard drive of\nthat other Mac visible to this new Mac,\n\n144\n00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,340\nwe can import the data from there.\n\n145\n00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,324\nAnd there's a few ways that I can do that.\n\n146\n00:07:44,324 --> 00:07:49,016\nMethod number one, I could take the hard\ndrive out of my old Mac, take it apart,\n\n147\n00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:51,973\ntake the hard drive out,\nand put it in the new Mac.\n\n148\n00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:54,165\nIt'll see that drive and\nimport the data from there.\n\n149\n00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:55,673\nThe problem is.\n\n150\n00:07:55,673 --> 00:07:57,328\nMost Macs don't have room for that.\n\n151\n00:07:57,328 --> 00:08:00,113\nLike mine, I can't remove\nthe hard drive from this one.\n\n152\n00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,500\nAnd even if I open it up,\nthere's no room for me to add another one.\n\n153\n00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,090\nIt's a laptop, right?\n\n154\n00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,980\nSo that's not always an option.\n\n155\n00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:13,280\nI could use an external,\nthey call them sleds or drive bays\n\n156\n00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,940\nwhere you can hook up an external hard\ndrive via USB or Thunderbolt or whatever.\n\n157\n00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,560\nSo you could connect the drive\nthat way and it'll see it and\n\n158\n00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,410\nallow us to import the data.\n\n159\n00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,670\nBut most iMacs, most MacBooks, support\nbooting into what's called target mode.\n\n160\n00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,040\nAnd with target we don't\neven have to take it apart.\n\n161\n00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,600\nWhen you boot up your old Mac\nyou can hold down the letter T.\n\n162\n00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,930\nAnd when you're holding down T and\nyou boot up it will boot into target mode.\n\n163\n00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,570\nAnd basically it turns your entire\nMac into a big external hard drive.\n\n164\n00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,480\nAnd now you can hook it up via USB or\nFire wire or Thunderbolt.\n\n165\n00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,560\nWhatever you got.\n\n166\n00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,060\nYou hook it up to the system and\n\n167\n00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,500\nyour new mac will see that\nas an external hard drive.\n\n168\n00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,080\nAnd it will be able input\nthe data that way too.\n\n169\n00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,810\nSo, tons of options for how we can\nget that data off of the old Mac.\n\n170\n00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,470\nAll right.\nWell, I'm going to go ahead and\n\n171\n00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,090\nchoose from a Mac for right now.\n\n172\n00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,870\nAnd I'll go ahead and move forward.\n\n173\n00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,230\nAnd now it's looking for another Mac\non the network to import data from.\n\n174\n00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,730\nI'm going to jump over to my old Mac, and\n\n175\n00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,210\non my old Mac, I'm going to run\nthe migration assistant also.\n\n176\n00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,330\nNow the migration assistant\nis a part of Mac OS.\n\n177\n00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,395\nIt's been around for a long time, and\nas long as you've done your updates\n\n178\n00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:28,415\nIt'll be compatible with the newer\nversions of the migration assistant.\n\n179\n00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:29,765\nSo I'm on Mavericks.\n\n180\n00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:31,405\nThis is the Mavericks Migration Assistant.\n\n181\n00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,935\nBut because I've done my updates,\n\n182\n00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:36,135\nit's compatible with\nthe Yosemite Migration Assistant.\n\n183\n00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:41,024\nAnd so I can just hit Continue it's going\nto log me out just like the other system\n\n184\n00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:43,570\ndid so it's going to log me out.\n\n185\n00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,840\nBut this time when I get to the migration\nassistant, instead of saying I'm pulling\n\n186\n00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,070\ndata from another Mac I'm going to\nsay I'm sending data to another Mac.\n\n187\n00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,130\nAnd I'll hit continue on that.\n\n188\n00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,080\nIt's going to search the network for\nanother Mac.\n\n189\n00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,970\nAnd if I jump back to the first\none it's still searching, but\n\n190\n00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,020\nit's also seeing my other computer.\n\n191\n00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,170\nHere's my old computer, OSX client 2.\n\n192\n00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,900\nSo now I can select it,\nand I can hit Continue.\n\n193\n00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,300\nThat didn't show up until I started\nrunning the migration assistant over here.\n\n194\n00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,300\nYou've got to start it on both sides.\n\n195\n00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,340\nSo here I'm going to choose that old Mac,\nand I'll hit Continue, and\n\n196\n00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,580\nnow it's going to display a PIN number.\n\n197\n00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,510\nThis is important, right?\n\n198\n00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,380\nHow do we know that we're really\nconnected to that other client and\n\n199\n00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,930\nit's not somebody bringing up a malicious\nmachine coincidentally at the same time.\n\n200\n00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,750\nThe way we know is with\nthis number right here.\n\n201\n00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,500\nMy number,\nthis is dynamically generated so\n\n202\n00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,340\nyou won't usually get\nthe same number twice.\n\n203\n00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,020\nSo mine's 163650.\n\n204\n00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:46,740\nIf I look at my other Mac, it should\nbe showing 163650 also, all right?\n\n205\n00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,100\nI need to make sure those numbers match.\n\n206\n00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,090\nAnd if I look on my new Mac,\nsee how I can't click continue?\n\n207\n00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,550\nI have to go to my old Mac.\n\n208\n00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,790\nThe old Mac is the one that has my data,\nit's the sensitive one, right?\n\n209\n00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,060\nIt's the one if I lose that\ndata it would be really bad.\n\n210\n00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,400\nSo it's the one where I\nhave to click continue.\n\n211\n00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,460\nSo on my old Mac, I'll hit continue and\n\n212\n00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,010\nnow it's going to start that\nsynchronization between OSX Client 2,\n\n213\n00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,940\nmy old machine, and what's it's\njust calling the New Mac, right?\n\n214\n00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,680\nAnd if I jump over to my new Mac, it just\nshows that it's checking the client, and\n\n215\n00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,010\nit's getting ready to\nsynchronize that new data.\n\n216\n00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,760\nNow, once it's ready,\nit's going to give me a list of my data,\n\n217\n00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,050\nbecause I might not want\nto bring everything over.\n\n218\n00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,220\nI can pick and\nchoose what I want to bring.\n\n219\n00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,560\nMy applications, right?\n\n220\n00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,180\nSo all the programs that I've installed,\nthey can come over.\n\n221\n00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,810\nMy user account can come over.\n\n222\n00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,620\nAnd you'll see in here, I can pick my\ndesktop, my documents, my downloads.\n\n223\n00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,360\nSo it's all that information that I can\nbring over as part of my user account.\n\n224\n00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,710\nOther user accounts,\nif I have them, can come over.\n\n225\n00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,980\nNow, I've got a problem here.\n\n226\n00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,020\nI have an account called\nHelp Desk on my old machine and\n\n227\n00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,150\nI've got an account called\nHelp Desk on my new machine.\n\n228\n00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,660\nSo what do I want to do?\n\n229\n00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,290\nWell if I leave it checked on the next\nscreen it's going to ask me do I want to\n\n230\n00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,670\nreplace the user that already have or\ndo I want to skip this user?\n\n231\n00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,740\nWell in my case I'm going to go ahead and\nskip it.\n\n232\n00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,750\nI'm just going to uncheck that user and\nthat'll take care of that conflict.\n\n233\n00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,560\nBut I could choose to replace it.\n\n234\n00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,250\nIf I choose to replace it,\n\n235\n00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,320\nit's going to ask me what to do\nwith the existing user's data.\n\n236\n00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,430\nDo I just delete it because\nit's being replaced?\n\n237\n00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,770\nOr, do I move it to\na Deleted Items folder?\n\n238\n00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,450\nAnd you can do that to save it.\n\n239\n00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,010\nIf this is a new machine,\nthen you usually don't care and\n\n240\n00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,980\nyou just let it get replaced and\ndelete the data.\n\n241\n00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,040\nThere's other miscellaneous files and\nfolders that it's pulling.\n\n242\n00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,130\nThese are generally updates\nthat have applied or\n\n243\n00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,530\nother information that might have\nbeen copied down from Apple.\n\n244\n00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,340\nAnd lastly, computer and network settings.\n\n245\n00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,670\nNow some of the settings\nthat it's going to bring in.\n\n246\n00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,480\nAre things that\nare convenient to us right?\n\n247\n00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,370\nIf I had a static IP in the old\nsystem I want to bring that static IP\n\n248\n00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,720\nover to the new system.\n\n249\n00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,620\nOr if I had wi-fi password\nsaved on the old system\n\n250\n00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,350\nit'll bring them to the new system.\n\n251\n00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,200\nAnd then computer preferences\nthe things like my finder and\n\n252\n00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,500\nmy doc preferences and so on.\n\n253\n00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,510\nI'm going to leave all those selected.\n\n254\n00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,630\nAnd we'll hit Continue.\n\n255\n00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,920\nAll right now it's actually\ntransferring the data.\n\n256\n00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,740\nThe more data you have,\nthe longer this is going to take.\n\n257\n00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,510\nI don't have a terribly\nlarge amount of data so\n\n258\n00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,910\nthis'll happen in a matter of minutes.\n\n259\n00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,830\nBut if you've got 200 gigs of videos and\n30 gigs of mp3s or\n\n260\n00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,470\nyour iTunes library that stuff's\ngoing to take a little while to copy.\n\n261\n00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,360\nThis could take hours upon hours to\ncopy especially over a slow network.\n\n262\n00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,230\nIf you're using Fire Wire or\n\n263\n00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,640\nThunderbolt it actually goes pretty fast\nbut over a network it can be pretty slow.\n\n264\n00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,260\nSo that's going to run and\nit will churn through and it will finish.\n\n265\n00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,940\nWhen it's done,\n\n266\n00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,620\nI'll have a new user account on\nmy new computer called Don Pezet.\n\n267\n00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,040\nAnd when I log in, it'll have the same\npassword as it did on the old computer.\n\n268\n00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,480\nAnd when I get logged in,\nI'll see all my documents, my wallpaper,\n\n269\n00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,460\nall the various things that I wanted\nwill be brought over to the new system.\n\n270\n00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,820\nAlright, looks like it just finished and\nit's about to restart so I'll go ahead and\n\n271\n00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,230\nhit restart now and\nI'll let that happen, all right?\n\n272\n00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,740\nSo it's going to reboot and\nI should have my data.\n\n273\n00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,690\nNow on my old computer,\nif I go to the old computer,\n\n274\n00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,240\nit's going to say that the migration\nis complete and I can hit quit.\n\n275\n00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,920\nNow the old computer still\nhas my data on it so\n\n276\n00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,470\nif I log into the old computer,\nit's all still there.\n\n277\n00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,920\nThat's because if something\nwent wrong I still need\n\n278\n00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,770\nto be able to get to this, right?\n\n279\n00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,490\nIt's got my data on it.\n\n280\n00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,720\nI need to be able to recover it.\n\n281\n00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,580\nSo I can come over here and\nI can get to it.\n\n282\n00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,470\nBut since my old computer's no longer\nneeded I'm just going to shut it down.\n\n283\n00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,350\nSo I'll shut down my old computer.\n\n284\n00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,990\nWe're going to get rid of it.\n\n285\n00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,810\nMy new computer should have all my data.\n\n286\n00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,070\nAnd we'll verify that in just a moment.\n\n287\n00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,140\nNow, if you're bringing your\ndata over from Windows,\n\n288\n00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,790\nthe process is actually the same.\n\n289\n00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,020\nThe only challenge to bringing\nit over form Windows,\n\n290\n00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,380\nis that Windows doesn't have\nthe Mac Migration Assistant.\n\n291\n00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,350\nCan you imagine if Apple or Microsoft,\n\n292\n00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,470\nstarting packaging the Apple Migration\nAssistant in their software,\n\n293\n00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,460\nit would be like they are encouraging\npeople to leave Windows.\n\n294\n00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,220\nSo it doesn't have it, all right.\n\n295\n00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,560\nSo the only difference in the steps\nthat we have before going to Windows,\n\n296\n00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,800\nis that we need to go and\n\n297\n00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,310\ndownload the migration assistant\non our Windows machine, all right.\n\n298\n00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,610\nAnd it gives us a little URL to do that.\n\n299\n00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,010\nI'll put it in the show notes,\n\n300\n00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,348\nin fact, let me pull up my show notes and\nI'll show you guys the link.\n\n301\n00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:23,030\nLet's see, I believe it is this one.\n\n302\n00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,350\nI've got two links in the show\nnotes that I'll post.\n\n303\n00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:30,050\nOne that's to the description of how\nthe Migration Assistant works and\n\n304\n00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,550\none that's the download,\nthis is the download.\n\n305\n00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,920\nSo here's the download\nfrom Apple it's DL1557.\n\n306\n00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,566\nIf you're looking for that download link,\nI'll post it in the show notes.\n\n307\n00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:42,774\nBut you go here on your Windows machine\nand you hit download and it download this\n\n308\n00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:47,075\nclient to your Windows machine and you\nrun it and it is the migration assistant.\n\n309\n00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:51,265\nAnd after that the steps are the same\nas what we went through on the Mac.\n\n310\n00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:54,697\nOn the new Mac you say that you're\npulling from a Windows PC and\n\n311\n00:15:54,697 --> 00:15:57,450\nthen it starts searching the network.\n\n312\n00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,590\nThen you go to your old Windows machine\nand you run the migration assistant.\n\n313\n00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,270\nYou say you're going to a new Mac and\nit starts searching the network.\n\n314\n00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,590\nAnd they find each other and\n\n315\n00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,160\nthey display the numerical\ncode just like we saw before.\n\n316\n00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,440\nAfter that the process\nis exactly the same.\n\n317\n00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,220\nThe only difference is having to download.\n\n318\n00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,650\nAnd install these migration systems.\n\n319\n00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,880\nWhen that's done,\nit'll import all that data to the Mac.\n\n320\n00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,100\nNow, there's some things\nthat aren't compatible,\n\n321\n00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,330\nlike there's applications on\nWindows that won't run on Mac.\n\n322\n00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,040\nSo it's not gonna bring\nyour applications over.\n\n323\n00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:32,495\nThat's not gonna happen, but your\ndocuments, your web browser favorites,\n\n324\n00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:36,675\nyour wallpaper, your network settings,\nthose things can come over.\n\n325\n00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:38,945\nThose will be brought over and\ncreated on the new system.\n\n326\n00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:43,615\nYour user account name will be created on\nthe new system, but some things won't,\n\n327\n00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:44,655\nespecially your applications.\n\n328\n00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:47,575\nAll right,\nlet's go see how this thing has done.\n\n329\n00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:49,311\nIt says migration is complete.\n\n330\n00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,800\nAnd there we go.\n\n331\n00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,250\nSo here I am on my new Mac.\n\n332\n00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,250\nThis is OSX CLIENT 1.\n\n333\n00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,390\nRight there, that's my new Mac.\n\n334\n00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,280\nAnd before I only had a help desk account.\n\n335\n00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,770\nNow I can see I do have\na Don Pezet account.\n\n336\n00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,510\nAnd if I click on Don Pezet.\n\n337\n00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,950\nI can provide my password, which is the\nsame password that I used on my old Mac,\n\n338\n00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,770\nso it actually brought\nthose credentials over.\n\n339\n00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,350\nAnd now when I get logged in,\nthere's my space wallpaper.\n\n340\n00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,920\nI've got my write application\nright there that I like to use.\n\n341\n00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,790\nI've got my autobiography sitting\nright there on my desktop and\n\n342\n00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:28,000\nif I fire that up,\nit should have my data in there.\n\n343\n00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,420\nI will try and launch it,\nit's kind of running a little slow there.\n\n344\n00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,570\nOh, my write application,\nI purchased that in the app store and\n\n345\n00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,180\nit's telling me I need to sign in.\n\n346\n00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,340\nI haven't signed into the app\nstore on this new Mac so\n\n347\n00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,180\nI do need to get that set up.\n\n348\n00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,600\nBut it did bring the application over so\n\n349\n00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,160\nI won't have to redownload it,\nit's already there.\n\n350\n00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,210\nAnd all of it's settings and\n\n351\n00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,220\npreferences are already there,\nI just have to sign in to do it.\n\n352\n00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,350\nWhich I'll hold off on doing that.\n\n353\n00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,840\nIf I go into the Finder and I go into my\nown documents, I can see I've got some\n\n354\n00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,870\nnotes sitting there that were brought\nover from that old system, right?\n\n355\n00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,520\nAnd notice the dock.\n\n356\n00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,500\nOn a default install of Yosemite\nthere's a ton of stuff in the dock,\n\n357\n00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,120\na ton of stuff I don't use, right?\n\n358\n00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,200\nLike, there's the Maps and iBooks and\n\n359\n00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,210\nall of those other things,\nI never use those programs.\n\n360\n00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,800\nSo I remove them from the dock.\n\n361\n00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,640\nAnd I see they've been removed here.\n\n362\n00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,180\nAll those preferences\nhave been brought over.\n\n363\n00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,550\nSo the migration assistant,\nit's pretty easy to use, and\n\n364\n00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:23,090\na great way to get your Mac up and\nrunning really fast.\n\n365\n00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,080\nYou bring your settings over from the old\none so you don't have to repeat them here.\n\n366\n00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,880\nSo if you can use the migration assistant,\ngreat.\n\n367\n00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,570\nThat works out really well.\n\n368\n00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,090\nBut in a business, you often don't know\nwho's going to be using that Mac, right?\n\n369\n00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,240\nI don't know who to import the data from,\nso it's not always an option.\n\n370\n00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,980\nFor a home user, this is a great option.\n\n371\n00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,220\nFor business users,\nit's not always possible, right?\n\n372\n00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,990\nSo in the business world, we've gotta\ngo and do the configurations ourselves.\n\n373\n00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,170\nAnd that's what we're gonna see for\nthe rest of this episode.\n\n374\n00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,870\nWe're gonna walk through the initial\nconfigurations people would do.\n\n375\n00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,920\nIf they didn't import all their\nsettings from their old Mac.\n\n376\n00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,360\nAll right, well that's a pretty good\nspot for us to stop and take a break.\n\n377\n00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,100\nSo let's pause here for a breather.\n\n378\n00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,900\nWhen we get back, we'll start\nwalking through all of those initial\n\n379\n00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,990\nconfiguration settings and go from there.\n\n380\n00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,935\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n381\n00:19:10,935 --> 00:19:18,280\n[MUSIC]\n\n382\n00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,930\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n383\n00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,080\nSo, in the first segment,\nwe took a look at the migration assistant.\n\n384\n00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,460\nNow I want to look at something\nthat's similarly named,\n\n385\n00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,750\ncalled the setup assistant.\n\n386\n00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,550\nNow, if you're following along in\nthe Exam Objective Guide from Apple,\n\n387\n00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,480\nI'm gonna go a little out of order here,\n\n388\n00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,860\nbecause I'm trying to put\nthis in a more logical order.\n\n389\n00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,840\nBut I want to talk about\nthat Setup Assistant.\n\n390\n00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,610\nBecause unlike the migration Assistant,\n\n391\n00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,240\nyou only get one chance to\nrun the Setup Assistant.\n\n392\n00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,210\nThe first time you boot up Yosemite after\nan install, it runs the Setup Assistant.\n\n393\n00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,840\nIt asks you a few questions\nabout your configuration and\n\n394\n00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,680\nyou answer it right then.\n\n395\n00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,120\nWe saw it,\nin the installation episode earlier.\n\n396\n00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,270\nWell, you answer those questions and\n\n397\n00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,660\nafter that little assistant\nis done that's the end.\n\n398\n00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,690\nYou can't run it again unless\nyou do a reinstall, right?\n\n399\n00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,590\nWell, fortunately adjusting those setting\nis pretty easy without the assistant.\n\n400\n00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,500\nBut let's walk through the assistant\nreal quick so that we can see it,\n\n401\n00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,570\nand then what we'll do is we will take\na look at how to change those settings\n\n402\n00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,940\nwithout using the assistant afterwards.\n\n403\n00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,670\nAll right, the first time you\nboot up a system with Yosemite,\n\n404\n00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,780\nit's gonna ask you a couple of basic\nquestions that center around you.\n\n405\n00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,230\nSo it starts off with\nwhat country you're in.\n\n406\n00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,130\nAnd you're giving it a region so\n\n407\n00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,040\nthat it can setup the various\nlocality information for you.\n\n408\n00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,630\nSo what currency symbol you use,\nhow you write the time,\n\n409\n00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,350\nwhat language you should be in.\n\n410\n00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,670\nIt's trying to determine\nthat type of information.\n\n411\n00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,210\nIt displays the primary\ncountries by default.\n\n412\n00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:42,240\nBut if you click Show All it'll actually\nadd a lot more countries to the list.\n\n413\n00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,960\nSo if you're in a country\nthat Apple didn't deem\n\n414\n00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,740\nmajor enough to put in the list,\nwell, you are still there,\n\n415\n00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,710\nyou just have to check the little box,\nall right?\n\n416\n00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,060\nBut I'm here in the US, and\nI think that's what's chosen by default.\n\n417\n00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,830\nAnd so we'll just hit Continue.\n\n418\n00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,770\nAnd now it's gonna ask about my keyboard,\nagain thinking about localities.\n\n419\n00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,960\nNow, the keyboards that are in the list\nwere derived from my first choice.\n\n420\n00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,640\nI chose the United States.\n\n421\n00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,080\nIn the US there's really only\none keyboard that we use, but\n\n422\n00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,760\nin Canada they have a Canadian English and\na Canadian French keyboard, and so\n\n423\n00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,130\nyou might see those options\nhere on the list too.\n\n424\n00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,760\nThere's a Colemak layout and\nDvorak layout.\n\n425\n00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,020\nThese are different key arrangements\non keyboards you might have.\n\n426\n00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,590\nIf you happen to use an international\nkeyboard, though, you can put show all and\n\n427\n00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,280\nyou'll see the other ones in there, so you\ncan pick a French keyboard or whatever.\n\n428\n00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,940\nBased on what your needs happen to be.\n\n429\n00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,440\nAll right?\n\n430\n00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,990\nHere's the migration assistant.\n\n431\n00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,520\nIt gives us a chance to do a migration,\njust like we saw in the first segment.\n\n432\n00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,500\nWe know we can run this\nlater if we want to though.\n\n433\n00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,460\nI'm gonna choose don't transfer anything,\nbut\n\n434\n00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,970\notherwise I could do\nthe transfer right now.\n\n435\n00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,540\nOne of the nice things about\ndoing the transfer right now,\n\n436\n00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,180\nis that it will automatically\ncreate your user account.\n\n437\n00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,870\nIf I don't,\n\n438\n00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,210\nif I say don't transfer anything,\nI'm gonna have to create a user account.\n\n439\n00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,710\nAnd so that's what the next\nfew screens center around.\n\n440\n00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,230\nIn Yosemite there's that big push for\n\n441\n00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,820\niCloud services so\nit wants me to log in with my Apple ID.\n\n442\n00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,730\nI'm gonna say don't sign in for that.\n\n443\n00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,850\nIt will continue to harass you\nabout that iCloud ID though.\n\n444\n00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,050\nApple really wants you to use it.\n\n445\n00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,560\nIn a home environment you definitely will,\n\n446\n00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,470\nin a business environment you may or\nmay not.\n\n447\n00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,930\nAll right, so it's asking if I'm sure\nthat I actually wanna skip that and I do.\n\n448\n00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,160\nNow I get my licence agreement so\n\n449\n00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,990\nI'll sign off on that,\nnothing too spectacular there.\n\n450\n00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,410\nAnd now it's gonna have\nto create a user account.\n\n451\n00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,540\nSince I didn't import\nsettings from another Mac,\n\n452\n00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,890\nit doesn't have another user account for\nme.\n\n453\n00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,360\nSo I need to create one.\n\n454\n00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,790\nNow, I normally create one called help\ndesk or something of that nature.\n\n455\n00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,890\nA generic one.\n\n456\n00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,230\nAnd then I add my own\nuser accounts afterwards.\n\n457\n00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,450\nIt's up to you, how you wanna get that\nsetup for that initial user account.\n\n458\n00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,790\nSo I'll provide a password for it.\n\n459\n00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,470\nAnd it's setting the timezone based\non the locale that I picked earlier.\n\n460\n00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,460\nWe can always change that and\noverride it if we want to.\n\n461\n00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,680\nWe'll see that over there later.\n\n462\n00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,360\nAnd we'll continue on.\n\n463\n00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,010\nThat should be about it.\n\n464\n00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,620\nWe've got our diagnostic and\nuses information.\n\n465\n00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,510\nSo what it's saying here is,\nif you have a failure,\n\n466\n00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,050\ndo you want to report the error back to\nApple so that they can try to fix it?\n\n467\n00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,930\nAnd, do you want to report\njust general system usage.\n\n468\n00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,970\nApple actually tracks how people use\nthe system, what programs you use and\n\n469\n00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:20,510\nthings like that.\n\n470\n00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,285\nSo they can determine what features to\nkeep, what features to phase out and\n\n471\n00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:25,775\nwhat users are looking for.\n\n472\n00:23:25,775 --> 00:23:29,643\nIf you wanna participate in that you can,\nbut you don't necessarily have to.\n\n473\n00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:34,325\nAll right, and then that's all it needs.\n\n474\n00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:37,025\nNow it's setting up my Mac and\nI'm gonna jump in.\n\n475\n00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:40,158\nNow, there was one screen\nthat didn't turn up in here.\n\n476\n00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:44,700\nOn some Macs, if it does not automatically\nconfigure your network connection,\n\n477\n00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,725\nyou'll get another screen that will\nask about your network settings.\n\n478\n00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:50,152\nIt'll ask how you're connected.\n\n479\n00:23:50,152 --> 00:23:51,556\nWired or wireless?\n\n480\n00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:55,526\nIf you choose wireless, it will give\na screen that lists all the wireless that\n\n481\n00:23:55,526 --> 00:23:58,760\nare out there and\nlet you pick the one to connect to.\n\n482\n00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,130\nIf it's wired, it will give you\nthe option to select a static IP address.\n\n483\n00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,180\nYou manually enter in the IP address.\n\n484\n00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,960\nSo you may see a network screen also,\nin addition to what I just saw there.\n\n485\n00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,900\nNow, I didn't see it, and\nhad I thought about it.\n\n486\n00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,570\nYou can actually hit the back button a few\ntimes, and it will make it show up, but\n\n487\n00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,510\nby default it doesn't show up.\n\n488\n00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,050\nAll these settings can be adjusted after\nthe fact, so I'm not too worried about it.\n\n489\n00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,010\nAll right, so here I am,\nI'm booted into a fresh,\n\n490\n00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:28,550\nclean install of Yosemite, I just\ncompleted the set up assistant, right.\n\n491\n00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,740\nNow the set up assistant is gone for me.\n\n492\n00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,908\nI don't run it again.\n\n493\n00:24:31,908 --> 00:24:32,860\nIf I wanna go back and\n\n494\n00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,880\nadjust any of those other settings I\nneed to rely on my system preferences.\n\n495\n00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,930\nAll right, I'm gonna get rid of\nmy little install disk here so\n\n496\n00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,350\nwe'll just chuck that in the trash and\nnow I've got my basic install.\n\n497\n00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,940\nNow, I do wanna make one comment\nbefore I go too much further on this.\n\n498\n00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,460\nWe're about to go through a number\nof preference settings and if you're\n\n499\n00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,820\na home user, if this is your personal Mac,\nyou're gonna do these settings yourself.\n\n500\n00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,820\nIn a business environment though, you\nprobably aren't just setting up one Mac.\n\n501\n00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,640\nYou might have just bought\na batch of 100 Macs or 1000 Macs.\n\n502\n00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,400\nAnd you need to get all of these\nsettings configured, all right.\n\n503\n00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:11,070\nWell for\na home user you just do it by hand.\n\n504\n00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,920\nIt's one machine.\n\n505\n00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,870\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n506\n00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,410\nBut if you have 1000 Macs you don't\nwanna have to go through this\n\n507\n00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,430\nprocess 1000 times.\n\n508\n00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,970\nIt takes for ever.\n\n509\n00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,350\nSo you want a way to automate it.\n\n510\n00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,550\nIn the Apple world,\n\n511\n00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:26,850\nthey actually do have a way to automate\nthe setting of our preferences.\n\n512\n00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,190\nYou do it with a utility that's\ncalled the profile manager.\n\n513\n00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,300\nAnd we don't really cover\nthe profile manager in this show.\n\n514\n00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,410\nI know I did cover it in\nthe Apple management basics, or\n\n515\n00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,680\nMac management basics of the.\n\n516\n00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,350\nSo if you jump back to there we cover it.\n\n517\n00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,250\nBut we also cover it,\n\n518\n00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,420\nor will cover it, in the ACTC show where\nwe jump into a lot of the server stuff.\n\n519\n00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,660\nBut basically,\nif you install the OS X server utility.\n\n520\n00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,070\nIt has what's called\nthe profile manager in it.\n\n521\n00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,590\nAnd it lets you define a profile.\n\n522\n00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,810\nAnd all a profile is,\nis a collection of settings.\n\n523\n00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,450\nA collection of preferences.\n\n524\n00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,440\nAnd it stores them all in one file.\n\n525\n00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,550\nAnd you can take that one file, and\nyou can manually copy it to any Mac.\n\n526\n00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,230\nYou stick in on a USB key if you want,\nplug it into a MAC and double click on\n\n527\n00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:14,040\nthe file and it will automatically apply\nall the settings that are stored in it.\n\n528\n00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,870\nBut the real power of the profile manager,\nis it can do it automatically.\n\n529\n00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,800\nYou can have it set up on the profile\nmanager where when the clients connect,\n\n530\n00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,100\nthat it automatically pushes all those\nsettings over the network down to them and\n\n531\n00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,470\nit knocks it all out.\n\n532\n00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,250\nVery easy, very straightforward.\n\n533\n00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,400\nAnd if you wanna change those\nsettings down the road,\n\n534\n00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,760\nyou can change them on the server and\nall of your Macs will receive that change.\n\n535\n00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,810\nNow, the profile manager originally\nstarted out as a way to manage iPhones and\n\n536\n00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,840\niPads, mobile devices.\n\n537\n00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,380\nBut it was so successful that Apple\nbrought it over to support Mac OS,\n\n538\n00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,440\nthe desktop OS also.\n\n539\n00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,780\nAnd so it can do all of it.\n\n540\n00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,730\nIt's a full management solution for\nall of your Apple devices.\n\n541\n00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:59,150\niPhone, iPad, MacBooks, Mac Pros, iMacs.\n\n542\n00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,160\nThe whole list, right?\n\n543\n00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,080\nThe whole shooting gallery is\nwhat I was going to say there.\n\n544\n00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,700\nJust to make sure everyone knows I'm not.\n\n545\n00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,105\nAbout to cuss.\n\n546\n00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:07,840\n[LAUGH] So\n\n547\n00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,970\nthe whole thing you can manage right from\ninside the profile manager, all right.\n\n548\n00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,290\nNow, it's not part of\nthe scope of this show but\n\n549\n00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:19,055\nif you wanna mess around with it,\nthe OSX server.\n\n550\n00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,135\nIt's $20 in the app store.\n\n551\n00:27:21,135 --> 00:27:22,365\nAnd it's worth every penny.\n\n552\n00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:23,905\nIt does so much great stuff.\n\n553\n00:27:23,905 --> 00:27:28,155\nI'm really excited to get to that ACTC\nshow cuz I love working in the OSX Server.\n\n554\n00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:30,055\nIt has really cool things in there.\n\n555\n00:27:30,055 --> 00:27:33,015\nBut it's not that hard to work with.\n\n556\n00:27:33,015 --> 00:27:34,925\nIf you want you can go out,\nyou can buy it for 20 bucks.\n\n557\n00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:36,505\nInstall it on your machine.\n\n558\n00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:38,485\nActually, I think I have\nit running here on my,\n\n559\n00:27:38,485 --> 00:27:41,210\nI do have it running\nhere on my laptop here.\n\n560\n00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,830\nSo this is on my laptop,\nthe actual laptop I use for the show.\n\n561\n00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,760\nSo I've got OSX sever installed and\nif you bring it up the first time,\n\n562\n00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,050\nyou'll see a screen like this.\n\n563\n00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,940\nIt'll list the information\nabout your laptop.\n\n564\n00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,950\nAnd in these services, you'll see\nthe profile manager right there.\n\n565\n00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,670\nAnd the profile manager,\nyou can turn it on right here,\n\n566\n00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,200\njust by flipping that little switch.\n\n567\n00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,290\nAnd it takes a moment to get started.\n\n568\n00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:06,100\nAnd that's gonna fire up\nthat Profile Manager.\n\n569\n00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,580\nAnd then as soon as it's running,\na link is going to appear down here,\n\n570\n00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,170\non the bottom part of the screen.\n\n571\n00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,070\nThat's gonna take me to a web page.\n\n572\n00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,180\nThere it is.\n\n573\n00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,060\nOpen profile manager.\n\n574\n00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,720\nAnd so I'll click that,\nand it's gonna take me in.\n\n575\n00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,000\nAnd, I don't have a valid certificate,\nso I'll just have to say it's okay.\n\n576\n00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,730\nAnd it's gonna take me\ninto the profile manager.\n\n577\n00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,140\nNow, the webpage is not particularly fast.\n\n578\n00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,590\nBut that's ok, it does its job.\n\n579\n00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,824\nI guess I do need to get logged in.\n\n580\n00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:35,525\nSo let me get logged into this thing.\n\n581\n00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:37,250\nSee if I can remember my password.\n\n582\n00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,390\nAnd when you're logged\ninto the profile manager,\n\n583\n00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,830\nbasically what you do is you\ncreate collections of settings for\n\n584\n00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,530\ngroups or users or equipment,\nyou've got a ton of flexibility in here.\n\n585\n00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,240\nAnd if you want everybody to have\nthe same settings you can just go into\n\n586\n00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,470\nthis everyone.\n\n587\n00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,820\nAnd inside of the settings for\n\n588\n00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,740\nthem you'll be able to configure\nexactly what you want.\n\n589\n00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,190\nYou can export that as a profile.\n\n590\n00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,510\nAs one of those files\nthat I was talking about.\n\n591\n00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,810\nAnd the files are pretty recognizable.\n\n592\n00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,960\nThey'll have a name,\nyou can call them whatever you want.\n\n593\n00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,680\nAnd then they end in .mobileconfig, right.\n\n594\n00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,390\nIt's a long file extension,\nbut .mobileconfig.\n\n595\n00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,120\nAnd it was called mobileconfig originally\nbecause it was mobile devices,\n\n596\n00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,550\niPhone, iPad.\n\n597\n00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:20,310\nIt's still called mobileconfig,\nmostly for backwards compatibility,\n\n598\n00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,930\nbut also because it's a configuration\nthat is truly mobile.\n\n599\n00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,020\nYou can move it to any machine.\n\n600\n00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,770\nYou double-click on the file and\nit installs.\n\n601\n00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:31,310\nAnd just to kinda give you guys\nan example, if I go under my settings.\n\n602\n00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,020\nI'll just edit that here.\n\n603\n00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,220\nYou can see some of\nthe things we can configure.\n\n604\n00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,870\nThere are settings that apply to OSX or\nOS10 and iOS.\n\n605\n00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,690\nAnd so you see all these kinds of general\nsettings in here like our networking,\n\n606\n00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,080\nVPN certificates, and so on.\n\n607\n00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,720\nYou'll see settings that\napply just to IOS and\n\n608\n00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,070\nsettings that just apply\n[COUGH] to OSX on the desktop.\n\n609\n00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,940\nSo I see those settings\nare right down there.\n\n610\n00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,310\nAnd an administrator can go through and\nset everything the way they want.\n\n611\n00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,060\nYou know,\nmaybe you want a particular printer setup.\n\n612\n00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,700\nSo you can go in here.\n\n613\n00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,710\nYou can define a printer that you\nwant to be added to that list.\n\n614\n00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,970\nSo I'll add Tim's printer, all right.\n\n615\n00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,330\nSo I'm gonna add Tim's printer here.\n\n616\n00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,490\nThis one's gonna be available.\n\n617\n00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,100\nIt won't show up as the default yet,\nthere we go.\n\n618\n00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,970\nI'll make it the default.\n\n619\n00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,850\nSo now any machine that has\nthis profile applied to it will\n\n620\n00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:24,300\nautomatically show Tim's printer, and\nit will be their default printer.\n\n621\n00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,460\nAnd I can take this file and\ncopy it to those machines,\n\n622\n00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,430\nor I can push it over the network to those\nmachines if I have OpenLDAP running, and\n\n623\n00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,900\nthey'll automatically get this setting.\n\n624\n00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,120\nSo now, I've got a thousand Macs,\nthat all have Tim's printer.\n\n625\n00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,580\nAnd we can them out of paper\nin just a moment's notice.\n\n626\n00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,010\nSo that's the power of\nthe profile manager.\n\n627\n00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,518\nReally cool stuff.\n\n628\n00:30:41,518 --> 00:30:43,710\nIf you wanna get a chance\nto see it in action,\n\n629\n00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,020\njump over to the Mac\nmanagement basic show.\n\n630\n00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,830\nPart of the Apple Certified Associate,\nor ACA series.\n\n631\n00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,120\nWe've already covered it there in basic.\n\n632\n00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,690\nSo I show how it's used and\nhow it's deployed.\n\n633\n00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,110\nIf you stay tuned, down the road\nwe're going to record the ACTC,\n\n634\n00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,410\nthe Apple Certified Technical Coordinator.\n\n635\n00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:05,340\nWe'll go far more in depth on\nthe profile manager, how it works and\n\n636\n00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,210\nhow you can use it in large environments.\n\n637\n00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,680\nSo, really cool stuff there.\n\n638\n00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,470\nI wanted to mention that here.\n\n639\n00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,630\nBecause on the exam, they do mention\nthe Profile Manager, that it exists.\n\n640\n00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:19,200\nYou need to know the concept of\nwhat the Profile Manager is.\n\n641\n00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,250\nBut on the ACSP exam, they don't\nexpect you to know how to use it,\n\n642\n00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,930\nto know how to set it up, or\nconfigure it or whatever.\n\n643\n00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,810\nThey just want you to know that it\ncan create a file that ends in dot\n\n644\n00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,510\nmobile config.\n\n645\n00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:33,330\nAnd if you double click on it, it can\napply all the settings that we are about\n\n646\n00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,780\nto talk about here in the rest\nof the show in one fell swoop.\n\n647\n00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,028\nIt definitely makes life easier,\nall right.\n\n648\n00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:42,710\nThat's the profile manager.\n\n649\n00:31:45,031 --> 00:31:48,791\nAssuming I don't have a profile, though,\nI'm gonna need to go through and\n\n650\n00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,161\ndo these settings myself.\n\n651\n00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:54,097\nAnd I might need to override some of\nthe settings from the setup assistant.\n\n652\n00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:56,825\nOr there might be settings that weren't\nin the setup assistant that I need\n\n653\n00:31:56,825 --> 00:31:57,405\nto configure.\n\n654\n00:31:57,405 --> 00:32:00,690\nAnd we can find all of those\nin our system preferences.\n\n655\n00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,300\nAll right.\n\n656\n00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,280\nSo let's start there.\n\n657\n00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,550\nI'm gonna go up to my Apple menu.\n\n658\n00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,770\nAnd I'll go to System Preferences.\n\n659\n00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,470\nAnd let's talk a little\nbit about this screen.\n\n660\n00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,900\nYou know,\nwhat we're looking at right here.\n\n661\n00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,940\nThe setup screen, or\n\n662\n00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,830\nthe System Preferences screen,\nit's actually divided up into sections.\n\n663\n00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:21,090\nDepending on your computer,\nyou might see four sections,\n\n664\n00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,380\nyou might see five sections, there can be\na little bit of variation depending on\n\n665\n00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:29,050\nwhat you've got on your system, all right?\n\n666\n00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:33,110\nThe first section that you see,\nlet me get the official Apple names for\n\n667\n00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,390\nthese so\nI make sure I don't screw it up here.\n\n668\n00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:38,877\n[LAUGH] The first section you see,\nis what's called the personal section,\n\n669\n00:32:38,877 --> 00:32:39,800\nall right?\n\n670\n00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,170\nSo this first little divider,\nsee how we've got these lines, and\n\n671\n00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,710\nit's like a light grey here, then a dark\ngrey, then a light grey, then a dark grey.\n\n672\n00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,160\nSo the first one, that light grey section,\nthat's called personal.\n\n673\n00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,545\nAnd these are settings that\neffect your user experience.\n\n674\n00:32:53,545 --> 00:32:55,375\nUse and end user, all right?\n\n675\n00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:56,719\nIf you were to logout and\n\n676\n00:32:56,719 --> 00:33:00,255\nlogin as a different user these\nsettings wouldn't carry over.\n\n677\n00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:03,965\nThese settings apply to you\nas the end user, all right?\n\n678\n00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:06,720\nAnd it's things like our desktop and\nscreensaver.\n\n679\n00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,380\nIf I don't like that mountain wallpaper, I\ncan click on Desktop and Screensaver, and\n\n680\n00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,440\nI can go in here and\nI can change to a different desktop.\n\n681\n00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,460\nI can make it this crazy grass\nplateau thing, or something else.\n\n682\n00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,400\nSo, I can pick something that\nmakes me happy, all right?\n\n683\n00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,990\nWell we can go back to\nthe old Maverick's paper.\n\n684\n00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,650\nI can also pick other things like\nmy screen saver settings and again,\n\n685\n00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,530\nthese are applying to me as\nthe logged in user, right?\n\n686\n00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,030\nSo that's the personal section.\n\n687\n00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,710\nSome important ones that are in here.\n\n688\n00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,170\nLanguage and region.\n\n689\n00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:40,270\nIf we've changed our language or region\nfrom when we were in the Setup Assistant,\n\n690\n00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,510\nmaybe I've moved.\n\n691\n00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,780\nSo now I want to go in and update that.\n\n692\n00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,430\nI can go into Language and Region and\n\n693\n00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:48,500\nwe can update those settings that\nwere determined during the install.\n\n694\n00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,470\nDuring the install it'll\nonly let me pick one region.\n\n695\n00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,300\nMaybe I travel a lot.\n\n696\n00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,720\nMaybe I spend some of my time\nhere in the United States and\n\n697\n00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,280\nsome of my time in Quebec.\n\n698\n00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,180\nSo I need French Canadian\nas well as regular English.\n\n699\n00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,060\nSo I can come in here, and\n\n700\n00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,560\nI can add in additional languages and\nwe can start to customize that.\n\n701\n00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,650\nSo I can add in French, so\nI'll have this extra language.\n\n702\n00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,800\nAll right, it's asking me which one's\ngonna be my primary, I'll stick with\n\n703\n00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,050\nEnglish, as my primary, but I'll be\nable to switch to French if I need to.\n\n704\n00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:21,180\nAnd then for my region,\nI can quickly jump around there too.\n\n705\n00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,300\nSo I can go to the Americas and\nI can pick Canada.\n\n706\n00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,900\nAnd now I've got my Canadian region set.\n\n707\n00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,760\nAnd you'll notice the way that my time and\n\n708\n00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,360\ndate have been represented has changed\naround to reflect that new region.\n\n709\n00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,020\nNow if I were to pick somewhere like\nFrance, so I go to Europe, and France.\n\n710\n00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,920\nThere we go.\n\n711\n00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,760\nIn France they use the 24\nhour time by default, and so\n\n712\n00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,990\nit reflects that now as my new option.\n\n713\n00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,770\nThat's a default, and\nI can change that if I need.\n\n714\n00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,030\nSo I can go through and\ncustomize all this pretty easy.\n\n715\n00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:54,200\nNow I don't wanna do that because\nI don't wanna mess with that.\n\n716\n00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,840\nLike a French keyboard isn't a QWERTY\nkeyboard it's an AZERTY keyboard it's that\n\n717\n00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,680\nA, Z, E, R, T, Y, at the top.\n\n718\n00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,280\nSo, I'm just going to put\nthat back to the US so\n\n719\n00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,920\nI don't have to mess with the keyboard.\n\n720\n00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,880\nAnd actually you know,\n\n721\n00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,900\nI'm not sure that the keyboard\nsetting truly comes from there.\n\n722\n00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:13,230\nThere's another area, if I go back here.\n\n723\n00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,310\nIn the next section for keyboard.\n\n724\n00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:19,290\nAnd if I go into keyboard, let's see,\ncan I define my region in here.\n\n725\n00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:19,990\nNo I can't.\nAll right, so\n\n726\n00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,100\nit does come from the other side.\n\n727\n00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,210\nSo that would've effected my\nkeyboard if I had changed that.\n\n728\n00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,010\nSo that's the first band.\n\n729\n00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,770\nThat's the personal settings.\n\n730\n00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,540\nThe next band that's in here,\nif we go past personal, is hardware.\n\n731\n00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:38,330\nUnlike personal, the hardware setting\nwill typically effect the whole machine.\n\n732\n00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,890\nSo if I log out and somebody else logs in,\nthese hardware settings can carry over.\n\n733\n00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,720\nSo I've gotta be a little\nmore careful on these.\n\n734\n00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,770\nAnd here's where we'll see\nthings like our displays,\n\n735\n00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,460\nwhere we can set our screen resolution or\nif we have multiple monitors we can manage\n\n736\n00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,430\nthose settings,\nwe've got our keyboard and mouse.\n\n737\n00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,576\nThe one I normally go to is energy saver,\n\n738\n00:35:55,576 --> 00:35:58,559\nI might want my computer to\ntake a little longer before.\n\n739\n00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,640\nBefore it goes to sleep, or a little\nless time before it goes to sleep.\n\n740\n00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,500\nOr when that display sleep kicks in or\nwhatever.\n\n741\n00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,070\nWe can jump in here and\ncustomize that based on our needs.\n\n742\n00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,300\nGot our track pad settings,\nour printers, right?\n\n743\n00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,710\nSo if I wanted to add in printers,\nI could punch those in right here,\n\n744\n00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,320\nall based on what I'm trying to achieve,\nright?\n\n745\n00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,280\nSo that's the hardware section.\n\n746\n00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,690\nThe next one in our list\nis internet unwireless.\n\n747\n00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,630\nThat's the section right here.\n\n748\n00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,410\nThis one's been growing\nover the last few years.\n\n749\n00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:31,620\nIt used to be that there was just\ntwo places in here that I would go.\n\n750\n00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,340\nNetwork, for\nconfiguring my physical network adapter,\n\n751\n00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,970\nwhich we'll see a little bit later.\n\n752\n00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:39,280\nAnd sharing where I can figure\nif I was sharing a folder or\n\n753\n00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,480\nif I was part of an open\ndirectory deployment, right?\n\n754\n00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,940\nSo we go in and\nset those settings in those areas.\n\n755\n00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,357\nBut we've seen some new\nones creep up like iCloud.\n\n756\n00:36:48,357 --> 00:36:52,735\nAll right, if we're going to be using\niCloud as our cloud storage solution and\n\n757\n00:36:52,735 --> 00:36:56,385\nour apps synchronization solution,\nwe need to go in here to iCloud and\n\n758\n00:36:56,385 --> 00:36:57,705\nconfigure those settings.\n\n759\n00:36:57,705 --> 00:37:01,685\nYou sign in with your Apple ID and\nyou specify what you want to synchronize.\n\n760\n00:37:01,685 --> 00:37:04,785\nBut, right next to it is\ninternet accounts, and\n\n761\n00:37:04,785 --> 00:37:07,435\nthis applies to a lot\nmore than just iCloud.\n\n762\n00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:10,800\nWe'll see Facebook,\nTwitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo,\n\n763\n00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,920\nwe can connect to these other vendors for\nemail, calendar, contacts.\n\n764\n00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,600\nRight?\nContacts are a big part because if you're\n\n765\n00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,310\nusing FaceTime and\nyou want to be able to reach out to people\n\n766\n00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,040\nyou need to have them\nin your contact list.\n\n767\n00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,090\nSo each of these can be added\nas an internet account.\n\n768\n00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:29,560\niCloud is listed under here also, and\nthat's part of the storage stuff.\n\n769\n00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,460\nIt'll be added automatically\nas part of that.\n\n770\n00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,920\nBut also if you've got the old MobileMe\nemail, or if you're using iCloud for\n\n771\n00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,010\nyour email service, it'll add that in too.\n\n772\n00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,640\nSo those are some areas that\nwe might need to go in and\n\n773\n00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,140\nset up in the internet and\nwireless section.\n\n774\n00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,160\nAll right, the last one that's displayed\non my screen is this bottom one here, and\n\n775\n00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,970\nthat is the system section.\n\n776\n00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,120\nUnder system, are where we have\nthings that an administrator\n\n777\n00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,340\nwould normally have to deal with.\n\n778\n00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,850\nSo your average end user won't\nhave to mess with this stuff.\n\n779\n00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,560\nIt's down here,\nit's things like users and groups.\n\n780\n00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,780\nWe can create additional user accounts or\ngroups for those users.\n\n781\n00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,220\nWe can set up our App Store updating.\n\n782\n00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,860\nThis is not our login for\nthe App Store, the Apple ID.\n\n783\n00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,590\nIf you click on that,\nit's really pertaining to system updates.\n\n784\n00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,570\nDo I automatically check for updates?\n\n785\n00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,760\nIf I find updates, do I download them?\n\n786\n00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,650\nDo I install them?\n\n787\n00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,850\nI might want to go ahead and install them.\n\n788\n00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:27,120\nIf I install app updates, do I stop there,\nor do I install OS X updates also?\n\n789\n00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,110\nSo I pick and choose based on what it is\nthat I need, and I can force an update.\n\n790\n00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:34,600\nThis is stuff that a system administrator\nwould do, not your average end user.\n\n791\n00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,800\nThat's why this is called the system\nsection, you'll also see things date and\n\n792\n00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,270\ntime, your startup disk, what hard drive\nyou boot to, setting up time machine and\n\n793\n00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,300\ngetting your backups configured.\n\n794\n00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,570\nThe only one that doesn't quite fit\nin my opinion is accessibility.\n\n795\n00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,340\nRight?\nAccessibility is typically\n\n796\n00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,515\nan end user decision.\n\n797\n00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:55,485\nSo why is it put here?\n\n798\n00:38:55,485 --> 00:38:58,925\nWell, first off if you're not familiar\nwith accessibility, these are features\n\n799\n00:38:58,925 --> 00:39:03,045\nthat make the computer easier to use for\nsomeone that has a disability.\n\n800\n00:39:03,045 --> 00:39:06,225\nIf you have a visual impairment or\na hearing impairment or\n\n801\n00:39:06,225 --> 00:39:08,375\na motor skills limitation, right?\n\n802\n00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:10,820\nthat's becoming unfortunately more and\nmore common.\n\n803\n00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,770\nWell if you've got that issue, you might\nnot be able to properly use Mac OS the way\n\n804\n00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,450\nthat it's set up and you can go into\naccessibility and configure that.\n\n805\n00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,720\nWell, it seems like that would\nbe an end user thing, right?\n\n806\n00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,870\nAs my user account,\nif I am visually impaired,\n\n807\n00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,430\nI might need to set a high contrast view,\nright?\n\n808\n00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,480\nBut if another viewer logs in,\nthey don't need that.\n\n809\n00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,550\nSo, why is it down here in System?\n\n810\n00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:36,520\nWell, the reason is we need this\nto apply to the logon screen also.\n\n811\n00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,735\nThe logon screen prior to a user\neven logging into the system.\n\n812\n00:39:39,735 --> 00:39:43,205\nAnd so for that you need an administrator.\n\n813\n00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:46,255\nYou need something because that's\nnow affecting the system as a whole,\n\n814\n00:39:46,255 --> 00:39:47,755\nnot just somebody who is logged in.\n\n815\n00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:50,923\nSo that's why it's buried\ndown here under System.\n\n816\n00:39:50,923 --> 00:39:55,540\nAll right, now, I said there was five\ndifferent sections of system preferences.\n\n817\n00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,860\nI only see four.\n\n818\n00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,300\nWhat's the fifth one?\n\n819\n00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,950\nWell, the fifth one is\nThird-Party utilities.\n\n820\n00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:06,350\nWhen you install Third-Party Software,\nsometimes they will attach a preferences\n\n821\n00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,250\npanel in here too, or\nthey call it a preferences pane.\n\n822\n00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:13,070\nWell, if you do that,\na fifth little segment will show up, and\n\n823\n00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,780\nlet me show you an example.\n\n824\n00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,040\nThere's a utility I use called SwitchResX.\n\n825\n00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:21,210\nIt lets me manually set\nthe screen resolution.\n\n826\n00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,430\nReally handy on multi-monitor installs and\nstuff.\n\n827\n00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,970\nSo if I install SwitchResX,\nit has a preference pane for itself.\n\n828\n00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,120\nIt doesn't have to be a complex\nutility like this either, though.\n\n829\n00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:38,310\nEven simple ones like the Logitech driver\nfor your track ball or my track ball here.\n\n830\n00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,500\nIf I were to install\nthe actual Logitech driver,\n\n831\n00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,690\nit installs a little Third-Party pane.\n\n832\n00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:46,720\nSo, over time as you add more and\nmore peripherals,\n\n833\n00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,700\nyou may find that you end up with four or\nfive, maybe more,\n\n834\n00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,310\nof these third-party preferences and\nthey'll all fit there in that fifth one.\n\n835\n00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,170\nAnd apparently it's not\ngonna let me download.\n\n836\n00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,140\nOh sorry, I'm being impatient.\n\n837\n00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,130\nIt is downloading.\n\n838\n00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,840\nSo here,\nwe'll just install SwitchResX real quick.\n\n839\n00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,380\nHere we go, and when I install it see how\nI can install it for the user only or\n\n840\n00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,900\nfor all users of the computer.\n\n841\n00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,020\nI'm gonna install it for everybody.\n\n842\n00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,080\nI'm gonna go crazy on this one.\n\n843\n00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,990\nSo I'll punch in my\nAdministrator Password.\n\n844\n00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:19,670\nThere we go.\n\n845\n00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:25,537\nAnd now, when I go back to my preferences,\n\n846\n00:41:25,537 --> 00:41:29,710\nmy System Preferences here,\nlet me resize this window.\n\n847\n00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,140\nOops.\n\n848\n00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,040\nIt's actually not gonna let me resize it,\nis it?\n\n849\n00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,100\nNow, shoot, now I've got all sorts of\nmenus coming up here for that software.\n\n850\n00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,310\nLet me just clear that real quick.\n\n851\n00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,930\nAll right, great.\n\n852\n00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,995\nWonderful.\nThat's exactly what I wanted.\n\n853\n00:41:42,995 --> 00:41:45,820\n[LAUGH] Well,\nas soon as I get all this cleared out.\n\n854\n00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,690\nThere we go.\n\n855\n00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:47,540\nAll right.\n\n856\n00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,970\nSo, now I can see,\nI've got my four panes up here, I've got\n\n857\n00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,950\nmy Personal, my Hardware,\nInternet and Wireless system, and now\n\n858\n00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:01,310\nI've got this fifth one down here at the\nbottom, that just has SwitchResX in it.\n\n859\n00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,010\nThat's that Third-Party.\n\n860\n00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:03,900\nAll right.\nSo you may or\n\n861\n00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,200\nmay not have anything in there.\n\n862\n00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,471\nIf it's empty,\nit just doesn't even show up.\n\n863\n00:42:08,864 --> 00:42:13,550\nAll right, now those are our System\nPreferences and kinda how they lay out.\n\n864\n00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,998\nI want to go into a few of them especially\non the networking side to tackle how that\n\n865\n00:42:16,998 --> 00:42:20,240\ngets configured, but this is a pretty\ngood spot to stop and take a break, so\n\n866\n00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,121\nwhy don't we pause here,\nwe'll take a break and when we get back,\n\n867\n00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:25,610\nwe'll jump into network configurations,\nafter this.\n\n868\n00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:33,180\n[MUSIC]\n\n869\n00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,000\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n870\n00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,490\nSo out of the system preferences that we\njust took a look at, the only one that\n\n871\n00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:42,570\nApple really calls out specifically\nin the exam objectives is Networking.\n\n872\n00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:46,740\nWhen you fire up your Mac, hopefully your\nsystem automatically configures itself for\n\n873\n00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,060\nwired or wireless and you're in business.\n\n874\n00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,450\nBut often times we've got to go in and\nprovide a little more information.\n\n875\n00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,250\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n876\n00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,400\nIf you're dealing with a wireless network,\n\n877\n00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,170\nthe setup doesn't even really\nrequire the system preferences.\n\n878\n00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:03,830\nYou'll have up in your menu bar\na little icon for wireless.\n\n879\n00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:06,290\nSo I see this little\nWireless Symbol up here.\n\n880\n00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,410\nAnd you can click on it and it'll show\nall the different Wireless Networks that\n\n881\n00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:12,770\nare in range and you can choose one and\nget connected to it.\n\n882\n00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:17,320\nAnd when you connect, if it's a secured\nnetwork, see these little lock symbols?\n\n883\n00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,550\nIf it's a secured network,\nyou'll get prompted for credentials, and\n\n884\n00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,915\nyou'll have to punch in your\nkey to be able to access it.\n\n885\n00:43:22,915 --> 00:43:25,175\nIf it's an unsecured network.\n\n886\n00:43:25,175 --> 00:43:26,035\nWell, that one's a printer.\n\n887\n00:43:26,035 --> 00:43:28,845\nI guess that doesn't really count but\nif it was an unsecured network,\n\n888\n00:43:28,845 --> 00:43:31,855\nyou'd be able to connect right to it,\nand that's the end of it.\n\n889\n00:43:31,855 --> 00:43:36,225\nSo, if you're using a Wireless Network,\nthe setup couldn't be easier.\n\n890\n00:43:36,225 --> 00:43:39,445\nBut we can configure this through\nthe System Preferences Screen,\n\n891\n00:43:39,445 --> 00:43:41,290\nalso this is not the only way to go.\n\n892\n00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:45,210\nAnd the other thing is that when we\ngo in here, this is all Wireless.\n\n893\n00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,770\nWhat about wired?\n\n894\n00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:51,480\nIf all you have is a wired connection you\ndon't even see that wireless symbol so for\n\n895\n00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,330\nexample, my other machine that I was using\nearlier it only has a wired connection.\n\n896\n00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,580\nSo when I look up here in the menu bar.\n\n897\n00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:03,150\nI've got no wireless\nsymbol up here at all.\n\n898\n00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,670\nIt's just that's it.\n\n899\n00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,350\nSo, you may not see\nthe network configuration item\n\n900\n00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,630\nin that menu bar by default.\n\n901\n00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,020\nSo, instead we go to\nour system preferences.\n\n902\n00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:20,120\nAnd in our system preferences, we go down\nhere to our internet and wireless section.\n\n903\n00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,140\nWe go under network, so\nthis little blue globe looking icon.\n\n904\n00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,390\nThat's where we configure our network.\n\n905\n00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,690\nWhen you go in there,\n\n906\n00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:30,260\nwhat you're going to see is a list\nof all of your network adapters.\n\n907\n00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:33,370\nNow I'm pulling up my laptop and\nI do weird things on my laptop.\n\n908\n00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:37,990\nSo I have a lot more network adapters\nthen what your average user would have\n\n909\n00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,740\nbecause I, and not a standard use case.\n\n910\n00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,310\nBut if we take a look at this machine\nhere, just to get an example.\n\n911\n00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,210\nWhen you go into your\nSystem Preferences and\n\n912\n00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:50,590\nyou go into Network, you'll probably\nonly see one or two adapters over here.\n\n913\n00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:54,870\nHere's a wired adapter, so\nI see the greater than,\n\n914\n00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,800\nless than symbol with the dots between it.\n\n915\n00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,180\nAnd I've got a Bluetooth adapter,\nor Bluetooth personal area network.\n\n916\n00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,250\nSo it's got the Bluetooth\nsymbol right there.\n\n917\n00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,360\nYou might see other things, though.\n\n918\n00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,550\nYou might see Firewire.\n\n919\n00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,860\nYou might see your wireless adapter or\nothers.\n\n920\n00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:12,430\nAnd if you look at my list, I've got\na Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter connected.\n\n921\n00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:14,400\nThat's the one that's on\nthe side of my laptop.\n\n922\n00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,980\nHere, it's, there we go.\n\n923\n00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,125\nIt's one of these little jobs that\nit's Thunderbolt on one side and\n\n924\n00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:22,280\nRJ-45 on the other.\n\n925\n00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,580\nSo that's what I'm actually\nstreaming my video on, so\n\n926\n00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,520\nI don't want to unplug that or\nI'll lose my desktop share.\n\n927\n00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,330\nSo I'm seeing that Thunderbolt adaptor.\n\n928\n00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:33,660\nI need that because my laptop doesn't\nhave a physical Ethernet port, so\n\n929\n00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,150\nI use the Thunderbolt adaptor to get that.\n\n930\n00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,590\nNext you see my Wi-Fi.\n\n931\n00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,260\nThat's my wireless adapter.\n\n932\n00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,820\nAnd my wireless adapter is on right now.\n\n933\n00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,520\nSo is my wired adapter.\n\n934\n00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,580\nTechnically they're both connected.\n\n935\n00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,100\nBut your Mac will\nprioritize the wired one.\n\n936\n00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,120\nEven though they're both connected,\n\n937\n00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,850\nI'm actually using the wired\nconnection unless I lose it.\n\n938\n00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,130\nThen it will switch over to the wireless.\n\n939\n00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,870\nThe other ones that I'm seeing.\n\n940\n00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,300\nWell, I've got my old Samsung phone.\n\n941\n00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,910\nWhich I guess I can go ahead and\nremove that.\n\n942\n00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:03,150\nI don't need that anymore.\n\n943\n00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:07,790\nIf you're doing tethering to a phone,\nto be able to place calls through it or\n\n944\n00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:10,610\naccess the internet while you're\ntraveling, it'll show up in here.\n\n945\n00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:11,690\nAnd that's exactly what that is.\n\n946\n00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,020\nThat's my old phone.\n\n947\n00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,610\nAnd I can actually remove that one.\n\n948\n00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,120\nAll right.\n\n949\n00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:20,930\nThen I've got a USB network adaptor or\na USB phone, I'm not sure, and\n\n950\n00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:25,560\nit's actually trimming off that name so\nI can't see [LAUGH] exactly what it is.\n\n951\n00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,210\nI don't think it'll let me\nresize this window either.\n\n952\n00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,070\nYeah so,\nI'm not sure what that one is, but\n\n953\n00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,010\nI must have tethered to something else.\n\n954\n00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,140\nApparently I get around,\nI tether to all sorts of stuff.\n\n955\n00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,670\nI'll go ahead and remove it too.\n\n956\n00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,370\nHere's another USB Ethernet adaptor.\n\n957\n00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:41,060\nIt's one that's under the podium\nhere that I use from time to time so\n\n958\n00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,050\nit's showing up.\n\n959\n00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:46,010\nSo you can end up with quite a bit in\nhere, and you might need to clean it up.\n\n960\n00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:49,020\nYou can just use the little plus and\nminus symbols at the bottom.\n\n961\n00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,250\nTo remove those, all right.\n\n962\n00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,990\nSo some of these I may just\nnot need anymore at all, and\n\n963\n00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,380\nyou just go through and\nknock them all out.\n\n964\n00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:57,130\nAll right.\n\n965\n00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:00,370\nI've also got my Bluetooth\npersonal area network there.\n\n966\n00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,550\nI've got a Thunderbolt\nbridge of some sort.\n\n967\n00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,130\nOh, that's my old docking\nstation showing up right there.\n\n968\n00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,760\nSo you'll see different things that\nturn up for network communications.\n\n969\n00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,550\nIf it's a wired connection,\nthe setup is really easy.\n\n970\n00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:16,040\nMost networks use something called DHCP,\n\n971\n00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,310\nthat's dynamic host\nconfiguration protocol.\n\n972\n00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:24,110\nAnd that means when a host or\na computer plugs in, it asks the network,\n\n973\n00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:26,220\nit says hey network, I need some settings.\n\n974\n00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,480\nCan somebody give me an address and\nsome other configuration settings?\n\n975\n00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,700\nAnd a DCP server out on the network\nwill hear that, and reply back, and\n\n976\n00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,220\nsay hey, yeah.\n\n977\n00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,540\nWelcome to the network,\nuse this IP address, this subnet mask,\n\n978\n00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,375\nuse all this data and\nyou'll get connected just fine.\n\n979\n00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:40,571\nAnd you'll see that's what mine's doing.\n\n980\n00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:45,736\nI set use DHCP and\nit got all of its information just fine.\n\n981\n00:47:45,736 --> 00:47:46,686\nAll right.\n\n982\n00:47:46,686 --> 00:47:49,887\nBut not every network uses DHCP.\n\n983\n00:47:49,887 --> 00:47:50,797\nSo if we don't,\n\n984\n00:47:50,797 --> 00:47:55,290\nour laptop won't get its settings and\nI'll have to manually put them in.\n\n985\n00:47:55,290 --> 00:48:00,310\nSo you might need to come in here and\nadjust that to say manual.\n\n986\n00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,120\nInstead of use DHCP,\nwe'll say do a manual configuration and\n\n987\n00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,680\nnow you can manually specify those values.\n\n988\n00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,660\nYou can put in your IP address.\n\n989\n00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,091\nYou're subnet mask and your router.\n\n990\n00:48:11,091 --> 00:48:15,770\n[COUGH] Now those are the three\npieces you have to provide.\n\n991\n00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:19,470\nBut for most of us, there's one\nmore thing you're going to want,\n\n992\n00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:20,670\nand it's a DNS server.\n\n993\n00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,125\nAnd note notice how the DNS server is\ngrayed out here, you can't change it?\n\n994\n00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:28,715\nThe reason is you can have\nmore than one DNS server and\n\n995\n00:48:28,715 --> 00:48:31,425\nso they didn't wanna do\na bunch of blanks right here.\n\n996\n00:48:31,425 --> 00:48:34,225\nInstead, they made it\nwhere you click advanced.\n\n997\n00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:35,785\nAnd in the advanced screen.\n\n998\n00:48:37,525 --> 00:48:38,660\nNow it's gonna get mad at me, shoot.\n\n999\n00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:42,585\n[LAUGH] I'm doing this\non my actual laptop,\n\n1000\n00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:44,335\nlet me just jump over to this other one.\n\n1001\n00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:46,150\nSo if I go here into this one and\n\n1002\n00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:49,810\nI'll switch it to a manual address and\nI'll just punch in a fake address.\n\n1003\n00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:53,763\nI don't wanna change my address\nbecause I'll lose my screen share, but\n\n1004\n00:48:53,763 --> 00:48:54,929\nI'll go ahead and apply that.\n\n1005\n00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:58,331\nSo here, this one now has this\nmanually assigned address and\n\n1006\n00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:01,310\nsee how my DNS servers are now blank.\n\n1007\n00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:06,650\nI can go into advanced and in the advanced\nscreen I've got a DNS tab right there.\n\n1008\n00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:11,070\nAnd in my DNS tab I can add in\nwhatever servers I wanna use.\n\n1009\n00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,820\nAnd maybe they're the ITProTV servers.\n\n1010\n00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:19,298\nMaybe they're Google's\nservers which are 8.8.8.8.\n\n1011\n00:49:19,298 --> 00:49:22,110\nAnd 8.8.4.4.\n\n1012\n00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,638\nMaybe I use level threes.\n\n1013\n00:49:23,638 --> 00:49:25,295\nWhich are 4.2.2.1.\n\n1014\n00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,280\nRight, you can enter in as\nmany DNS servers as you want.\n\n1015\n00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,140\nIt's only gonna use the first one.\n\n1016\n00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,660\nBut if the first one is unavailable,\nit'll go to the second one.\n\n1017\n00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,400\nIf the first two are unavailable,\nit'll go to the third one.\n\n1018\n00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,680\nSo it doesn't really pay\nto enter a ton in here,\n\n1019\n00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,360\nbecause they're not all going to fail.\n\n1020\n00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,000\nBut you can enter in as many as you want.\n\n1021\n00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,140\nThat is really the other setting\nthat we need to have in place,\n\n1022\n00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,410\nbecause otherwise you won't be able to\nfire up a web browser type in a name,\n\n1023\n00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:50,890\nyou'll have to type in an IP.\n\n1024\n00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,980\nYou've gotta have those DNS servers.\n\n1025\n00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,510\nAnd now they're listed here\nseparated by commas, and\n\n1026\n00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:58,990\nthat's the reason why we can't\nenter it here on this screen.\n\n1027\n00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:01,340\nBut that's a manual IP\naddress setting right there,\n\n1028\n00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,380\nwe just punch in our values and off we go.\n\n1029\n00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:08,310\nIf we accidentally pick\na value that's already in use.\n\n1030\n00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,740\nSo like I know that .2 is already in\nuse on this network, and I apply it.\n\n1031\n00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:16,640\nThe Mac, didn't complain,\nwell eventually I'll get a collision and\n\n1032\n00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,240\nit won't work, and there we go.\n\n1033\n00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,400\nWe get a message that'll say\nanother device is using that IP.\n\n1034\n00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,866\nAnd while that happens, it's gonna\nstop my network adapter from working.\n\n1035\n00:50:25,866 --> 00:50:27,640\nAnd I'll have to come back in here and\n\n1036\n00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,090\nchange that to a different address\nbefore I'm able to communicate, right.\n\n1037\n00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:35,060\nSo it does a little bit of checking for\nyou to make sure you pick a good address.\n\n1038\n00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,899\nAnd if you put something invalid in there,\nright?\n\n1039\n00:50:37,899 --> 00:50:41,728\nSo if I maybe add an extra number and\napply it, it'll notice that's not a valid\n\n1040\n00:50:41,728 --> 00:50:45,051\naddress and it'll tell you, so\nit does some good checking on that.\n\n1041\n00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:49,500\nNow on the wired side,\nit's pretty straightforward, right?\n\n1042\n00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,290\nNothing too crazy there.\n\n1043\n00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,850\nOn the wireless side though,\n\n1044\n00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:56,370\nwe have an extra layer on top of\nthat that we have to worry about.\n\n1045\n00:50:56,370 --> 00:51:00,170\nSo I jump back over here to my machine,\nwhich is\n\n1046\n00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:05,160\napparently still stuck\ncomplaining about that address.\n\n1047\n00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,210\nWell, that's gonna make things difficult.\n\n1048\n00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,180\nI'll tell you what,\ngive me just a second and\n\n1049\n00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:15,430\nI'm gonna reset this adapter on my\nsystem so that it will stop complaining.\n\n1050\n00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:17,200\nOr you know, here's a good way to do it.\n\n1051\n00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,150\nBasically it's dealing with\nthat invalid address and\n\n1052\n00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,760\nit doesn't seem to be\nable to get over that.\n\n1053\n00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,237\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\njust gonna turn my WiFi off,\n\n1054\n00:51:25,237 --> 00:51:26,990\nwhich will make that adapter shut off.\n\n1055\n00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,370\nAnd that should make that\nerror message go away for me.\n\n1056\n00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:29,982\nWe'll give that just a second.\n\n1057\n00:51:29,982 --> 00:51:31,930\nAnd apparently not.\n\n1058\n00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:35,260\nApparently it's deciding that's\njust what it's gonna do.\n\n1059\n00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,344\nWell great.\nAll right.\n\n1060\n00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:37,472\nGive me just a minute.\n\n1061\n00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:39,350\nI'm gonna reset my laptop and\nthen we'll go in there and\n\n1062\n00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,780\ntake a look at those wireless settings.\n\n1063\n00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:43,940\nThe main thing I wanna show you is you\nhave to pick a wireless network and\n\n1064\n00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,470\nyou have to provide security credentials.\n\n1065\n00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,261\nSo I do want you guys to see that.\n\n1066\n00:51:46,261 --> 00:51:48,097\nBut give me just a moment\nto reset this and\n\n1067\n00:51:48,097 --> 00:51:50,423\nthen we'll get a chance to\nsee it right after this.\n\n1068\n00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:57,045\n[MUSIC]\n\n1069\n00:51:57,045 --> 00:51:58,650\nAll right, sorry about that guys.\n\n1070\n00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:02,240\nI just had to force quit out of my\nsystem preferences screen there.\n\n1071\n00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,670\nFor whatever reason it\nkinda got locked up there.\n\n1072\n00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:05,860\nThat does happen.\n\n1073\n00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:09,880\nIf you don't know how to do that,\nbasically you just go down here to your\n\n1074\n00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,380\ndock and\nyou find the program that's locked up.\n\n1075\n00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,152\nMine was system preferences.\n\n1076\n00:52:13,152 --> 00:52:16,253\nAnd if you control click or\nright click on it,\n\n1077\n00:52:16,253 --> 00:52:19,230\nyou'll see in there a force quit option.\n\n1078\n00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:20,470\nAnd if you don't see it,\n\n1079\n00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:25,690\nI've just got regular quit there, what you\ncan do is you can hold the option key and\n\n1080\n00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:28,780\nit changes quit to force quit,\nand that'll knock it out.\n\n1081\n00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,710\nSo that's exactly what I did.\n\n1082\n00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,940\nAll right, well, looking at my\nconfiguration here I've got my wired\n\n1083\n00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,270\nnetwork adapter and I've got my\nwireless network adapter right there.\n\n1084\n00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:42,440\nSo I've got that WiFi, and\nsays self assigned IP, right?\n\n1085\n00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,640\nThat's not a good thing.\n\n1086\n00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,090\nMy adaptor has a yellow light\ninstead of a green light.\n\n1087\n00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:50,729\nThat means I tried to get a DACP address\nand for whatever reason I didn't get one.\n\n1088\n00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:53,345\nAnd so I've made up an address\nI've self assigned,\n\n1089\n00:52:53,345 --> 00:52:55,325\nI just picked one out of the air.\n\n1090\n00:52:55,325 --> 00:52:58,525\nWell it's pretty much a guarantee\nthat one's not gonna work for us, so\n\n1091\n00:52:58,525 --> 00:53:01,575\nI need to go in and\ndo some additional configuration changes.\n\n1092\n00:53:01,575 --> 00:53:04,035\nThe first thing I need to do is make\nsure I'm connected to the right\n\n1093\n00:53:04,035 --> 00:53:04,683\nwireless network.\n\n1094\n00:53:04,683 --> 00:53:05,727\nMaybe I'm not.\n\n1095\n00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:09,617\nWhen I look at my wireless network I can\nsee my network name is set to NH Studio.\n\n1096\n00:53:09,617 --> 00:53:11,337\nThat is the right wireless network.\n\n1097\n00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:14,097\nBut if I drop that down I can\npick from the other networks.\n\n1098\n00:53:14,097 --> 00:53:18,067\nThis is the same as the menu\nup here where I can pick\n\n1099\n00:53:18,067 --> 00:53:19,227\nfrom the different wireless networks.\n\n1100\n00:53:19,227 --> 00:53:21,287\nThere's really no difference there.\n\n1101\n00:53:21,287 --> 00:53:22,177\nAll right.\n\n1102\n00:53:22,177 --> 00:53:25,527\nBut down at the bottom,\nI have the advanced button.\n\n1103\n00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:27,450\nAnd if I go into advanced,\n\n1104\n00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:31,440\nnow I'll see options where I can look at\nthe different networks that are available.\n\n1105\n00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,450\nOnes that I've connected to\npreviously that aren't visible.\n\n1106\n00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:37,140\nAnd you can take them and\nyou can change their order.\n\n1107\n00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,654\nSo if I wanna prefer\nNH Private over NH Studio,\n\n1108\n00:53:40,654 --> 00:53:45,620\nI can rearrange those to prefer\none versus the other, all right.\n\n1109\n00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,476\nAnd then my laptop is gonna\nprefer to connect to that one and\n\n1110\n00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:50,530\njump onto it whenever possible.\n\n1111\n00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:52,580\nSo you can rearrange those as needed.\n\n1112\n00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,310\nYou can add and remove them.\n\n1113\n00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:56,070\nYou can do various things.\n\n1114\n00:53:56,070 --> 00:54:00,917\nYou can also go in to TCP IP and\nassign a static IP address.\n\n1115\n00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:03,230\nAnd that's what I really\nwanted to show you guys.\n\n1116\n00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:07,920\nIs a lot of people assume you can't\nassign a static IP to a wireless network\n\n1117\n00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,540\ncuz when you're on wired you\nsee the option right there.\n\n1118\n00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,800\nBut when you go on wireless, you don't.\n\n1119\n00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,900\nWell, it is there,\nyou just have to go under advance.\n\n1120\n00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,117\nAlmost all wireless networks use DHCP, so\n\n1121\n00:54:18,117 --> 00:54:21,250\nit's really rare somebody\nhas to do a static address.\n\n1122\n00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:24,990\nBut if you want to, you can jump\nright in here and you can assign one.\n\n1123\n00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:27,601\nSo, I can come in here and\nsay I'ma manually use an address and\n\n1124\n00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:33,210\nit's gonna be 10.1.230.244 or\nsomething like that.\n\n1125\n00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:37,960\nAnd I'll specify what that address is\ngonna be with a subnet mask and a router.\n\n1126\n00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:44,820\nAnd I can jump over to DNS and\nI can provide some DNS servers to use, and\n\n1127\n00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:48,050\nany other information that\nI need to provide, right?\n\n1128\n00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:53,280\nNow my WiFi adaptor is going to know what\naddress to use, the only problem Is that\n\n1129\n00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:59,220\nthat static IP I just assigned is\nattached to any wireless network.\n\n1130\n00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:03,150\nIf I go to Pezet private here and\njump over to TCPIP it's still the same.\n\n1131\n00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:07,290\nSo if I jump from one wireless network to\nanother I now have a static address and\n\n1132\n00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,740\nthat's a problem, right?\n\n1133\n00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:11,610\nCuz I might need different IP\naddresses on different networks.\n\n1134\n00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:15,750\nThat's why we typically use\nDHCP right here, all right.\n\n1135\n00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:20,856\nBut now that's set if I exit this screen,\nnow my WiFi shows connected and\n\n1136\n00:55:20,856 --> 00:55:24,740\nit doesn't show a self\nassigned address anymore.\n\n1137\n00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,010\nIt shows that I statically assigned it.\n\n1138\n00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:29,240\nNow I am having a problem.\n\n1139\n00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,550\nIf you look up here my\nwireless network has a little\n\n1140\n00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:34,990\nexclamation point on the symbol up there.\n\n1141\n00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:38,003\nI'm connected to the wireless network,\nbut the odds are it's not functioning.\n\n1142\n00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:40,957\nRemember I had to force quit\nmy system preference panel,\n\n1143\n00:55:40,957 --> 00:55:43,173\nIt's probably lock my wireless driver and\n\n1144\n00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,512\nI've probably got a reboot in my\nfuture to try and correct that.\n\n1145\n00:55:46,512 --> 00:55:50,331\nBut sometimes you can\nturn the wireless off.\n\n1146\n00:55:50,331 --> 00:55:54,780\nAnd turn it back on again, which I could\nhave done with the button right here, too.\n\n1147\n00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:59,490\nThat will occasionally make these\nsettings kick in, fix the problem and\n\n1148\n00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,290\nget the adapter back up and\ngoing, in fact,\n\n1149\n00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:04,610\nI see a good five bars up\nhere on my signal now.\n\n1150\n00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,670\nAnd I'm connected, right?\n\n1151\n00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:08,640\nBut I do have that static IP,\nI wanna change that.\n\n1152\n00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,000\nSo I'm gonna go back to advanced and\nTCP/IP.\n\n1153\n00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,020\nAnd I'll switch that back to DACP,\nwhich, apparently, it did on its own.\n\n1154\n00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:19,300\nAnd I'm just gonna remove\nthis statically set.\n\n1155\n00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,560\nOh, nope, it's pulling that from DACP2,\nso I can't remove it there.\n\n1156\n00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,730\nSo I'm good.\n\n1157\n00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:25,690\nGo ahead and say OK, and\neverything looks good there.\n\n1158\n00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:28,740\nSo it looks like we're good, and\nwe're back in business, all right?\n\n1159\n00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,270\nSo configuring the network\nis not terribly difficult.\n\n1160\n00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:32,070\nIt's right here.\n\n1161\n00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:34,270\nYou just jump in and you do your settings.\n\n1162\n00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:37,150\nBut it does take a little bit of effort to\nget in there and assign the static IPs,\n\n1163\n00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:37,770\nif that's what you need.\n\n1164\n00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:41,380\nAll right, so that's pretty much it for\nthe networking panel.\n\n1165\n00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,880\nJust be aware you may have to\ncome in here and set this up.\n\n1166\n00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,960\nActually, it looks like I'm still\nhaving some kind of wireless problem.\n\n1167\n00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,670\nI lost my Internet studio connection.\n\n1168\n00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:52,190\nWe might actually be having a problem\nwith the access point here.\n\n1169\n00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:55,180\nCan any of you see the green light\non the access point over there?\n\n1170\n00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,210\nIs it lit?\n\n1171\n00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,250\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Okay, all right.\n\n1172\n00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,440\n>> Well, it might be my Mac then.\n\n1173\n00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,170\nSo, like I said the preference\npanel locked up on me so,\n\n1174\n00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,890\nI probably need to reboot\nto get that cleared out.\n\n1175\n00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:08,470\nBut, you guys have seen\nthe system preference panel and\n\n1176\n00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:10,180\nrecognize how to configure that adapter.\n\n1177\n00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,500\nAll right so that's about it for\nthis episode.\n\n1178\n00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,750\nLet me recap some of the things\nthat we talked about, right?\n\n1179\n00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:19,650\nWe were all talking about the initial\ninstallation and configuration of Mac OS.\n\n1180\n00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:22,330\nSo we started talking about\nthe migration assistant,\n\n1181\n00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,690\nhow to get all of our settings\nfrom our old machine.\n\n1182\n00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:27,390\nIf we don't do that we talk\nabout the setup assistant and\n\n1183\n00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:29,990\nhow it can do some basic\nconfiguration settings.\n\n1184\n00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,960\nAnd then we looked at system preferences.\n\n1185\n00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,790\nAnd how we can manually\ndo the system settings.\n\n1186\n00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:38,250\nI also threw in a little bit about\nthe profile manager just to make you guys\n\n1187\n00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,200\naware of that.\n\n1188\n00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,079\nIt's a neat utility that's out there for\nsystem admins and large environments.\n\n1189\n00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:48,020\nSo all in all, quite a bit of stuff, and\nit's all stuff you really only do once.\n\n1190\n00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:52,290\nYou set it all, and then you never come\nback to it again so it's easy to forget.\n\n1191\n00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:55,760\nMake sure you brush up on it for\nthe exams so that you know.\n\n1192\n00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:01,060\nThat's the last of the objectives for\nour first area, for part one, installing.\n\n1193\n00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,810\nThe rest of the series,\npart two through part eight,\n\n1194\n00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,210\nwe're going to be tackling\nmore advanced things.\n\n1195\n00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:07,440\nHow we use OSX.\n\n1196\n00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,300\nSo it gets a lot more exciting from there.\n\n1197\n00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:13,310\nBut this wraps up installing, so\nit's a good spot for us to stop today.\n\n1198\n00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:16,230\nLet me remind you guys, if you have\nany questions on what we talked\n\n1199\n00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:19,680\nabout live during the show,\nyou can go to ITPro.TV/live.\n\n1200\n00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,780\nYou'll see the chat box beneath the video.\n\n1201\n00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,060\nPost

--> 00:00:40,580\nAnother episode of ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,980\nBack again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,510\nNow in our first series of episodes we\nwere really focused on getting Mac OS\n\n6\n00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,060\ninstalled and\nkinda got that behind us now.\n\n7\n00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,600\nAnd so for the whole rest of the series\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\n\n8\n00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,445\nall the different things that we\ncan configure inside of Mac OS and\n\n9\n00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:01,760\nget the system up and running and\ndoing the stuff that we want it to.\n\n10\n00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,390\nIn today's episode we're gonna focus on\nsomething that's really important and\n\n11\n00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,960\nthat's our user accounts.\n\n12\n00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,640\nIf you're following along in the exam\nobjective list from Apple, this is part\n\n13\n00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,060\ntwo which I believe they call, I think\nthey just call it Managing User Accounts.\n\n14\n00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,840\nSo we're gonna take a look at\nthe different types of accounts that\n\n15\n00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,230\nare available and\nhow we work with them, what they do and\n\n16\n00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,390\nall that other good stuff.\n\n17\n00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,040\nSo without any further ado,\nlet's get started.\n\n18\n00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,490\nNow when you install Mac OS,\nas part of the installation wizard,\n\n19\n00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,240\nit asks you to create a user account.\n\n20\n00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,910\nAnd that user account might be\nsomething that's brand new,\n\n21\n00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,450\nthat you've never made before,\nyou're just creating it for this install.\n\n22\n00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,990\nOr it might be linked to an Apple ID.\n\n23\n00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,950\nIn Yosemite,\nthey're really pushing that new link\n\n24\n00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,000\nbetween your local user accounts and\nyour Apple IDs.\n\n25\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,030\nSo, if you've linked to Yosemite, while\nthe user account is technically new for\n\n26\n00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,820\nthe computer, it's also linked to\nthis existing account from before and\n\n27\n00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,490\nit brings it in, your password is the\nsame, it's kind of convenient I suppose.\n\n28\n00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,890\nWell if you've got that set up,\ngreat, you move forward.\n\n29\n00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,810\nBut either way,\nwhether you do a standalone account, or\n\n30\n00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,330\nan account linked to a cloud service\nlike iCloud, once you login,\n\n31\n00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,380\nthat initial account is made\nan administrator, all right?\n\n32\n00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,110\nAnd that's the first type of user account\ninside of Mac OS that I wanna talk about.\n\n33\n00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,750\nNow, during the installation episodes,\nI created one user during my install, and\n\n34\n00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,630\nthat user was just called, help desk.\n\n35\n00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,840\nSo when I reboot my computer,\nI see a prompt that looks like this, and\n\n36\n00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,660\nit's apparently picked the old magic\neight ball from my user account.\n\n37\n00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,660\nBut since I only have one account, it\ndoesn't ask me who I am as far as a user,\n\n38\n00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,350\nit just gives me that one account.\n\n39\n00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,830\nHelp desk, that's what I made.\n\n40\n00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,200\nAnd I punch in my password.\n\n41\n00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,390\nAnd I get a logged in.\n\n42\n00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,050\nThere's not a whole lot of options\nhere that are available for me.\n\n43\n00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,520\nNow I do have a little back arrow\nto the left of the password prompt.\n\n44\n00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,350\nAnd the reason that back arrow is there,\nthat guy right there, is if I'm\n\n45\n00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,100\njoined to a network server, like an open\ndirectory, I might need to hit back so\n\n46\n00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,010\nthat I can type in a username\nalong with my password, right?\n\n47\n00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,030\nBut in my case, this is a fresh install.\n\n48\n00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,530\nI'm not joined to an open directory yet.\n\n49\n00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,670\nI'm just gonna log in\nwith this one account.\n\n50\n00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,280\nWe get logged in, and now we're logged\nin with that administrator account.\n\n51\n00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,890\nNow what is an administrator?\n\n52\n00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,520\nWell, an administrator has full\nunfettered access to the system.\n\n53\n00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,300\nThat means they can do whatever they want.\n\n54\n00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,230\nThey can make changes to\ntheir individual settings.\n\n55\n00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,150\nThey can make changes to\nthe system as a whole.\n\n56\n00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,820\nRemember from the system preferences\nepisode, when we go into system\n\n57\n00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,580\npreferences, they're divided up\ninto these little banners, right?\n\n58\n00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,280\nAnd this first one is personal.\n\n59\n00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,550\nEverybody can change that stuff.\n\n60\n00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,060\nIt's their own settings\nthat pertain to that user.\n\n61\n00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,860\nBut some of the other ones are related\nto hardware or the networking side or\n\n62\n00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,010\nthe system itself, right?\n\n63\n00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,370\nAnd these you really need to be\nan administrator to modify, right?\n\n64\n00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,240\nSo as an administrator we can go in and\nstart to tailor the settings,\n\n65\n00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,440\nmake adjustments, do whatever we needed.\n\n66\n00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,080\nAs a regular user we might not be able to,\nall right?\n\n67\n00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:04,680\nThe terminology that you see inside of\nMac OS is administrator or standard user.\n\n68\n00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,670\nA standard user is the second\ntype of user account.\n\n69\n00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,620\nAnd that's a user account that\nhas access to the system.\n\n70\n00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,270\nThey can log in and see things and\nwork with the system.\n\n71\n00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,280\nBut there's some things they can't do.\n\n72\n00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,210\nThey can't do things\nlike system-wide changes.\n\n73\n00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,370\nThey can't write to\nthe Applications folder, so\n\n74\n00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,270\nthey can't even install\nan application if they don't.\n\n75\n00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,030\nWell, let me clarify that.\n\n76\n00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,860\nThey can install an application\nthrough the App Store, but\n\n77\n00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,210\nthey can't do it through just like\na regular download an app and\n\n78\n00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,970\nthrow it into the Applications folder.\n\n79\n00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,710\nCuz they don't have permission to write\nto that folder by default, right?\n\n80\n00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,880\nSo there's a lot of things\nthat a standard user can't do.\n\n81\n00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,150\nNow for a lot of people,\nthey get that nice, shiny, new Mac.\n\n82\n00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,040\nAnd they fire it up.\n\n83\n00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,130\nThey log in.\nThey create their administrator account.\n\n84\n00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,740\nAnd they just run with that administrator\naccount for the life of their computer.\n\n85\n00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,390\nAnd you can certainly do that.\n\n86\n00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,115\nThere's a good argument that that's fine.\n\n87\n00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:54,780\n[LAUGH] I don't necessarily agree with it,\nbut people do it.\n\n88\n00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,000\nLet's talk about some of the advantages\nand disadvantages of that, right?\n\n89\n00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,720\nThe advantage of logging in as\nadministrator is that you can do whatever\n\n90\n00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,588\nyou want, right?\n\n91\n00:05:02,588 --> 00:05:06,540\nSo if I'm just working along and all of\nthe sudden I wanna make a system change,\n\n92\n00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,890\nI wanna install an application\nwithout the app store,\n\n93\n00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,870\nwell I'll get a little prompt that will\nsay are you sure you wanna do this, right?\n\n94\n00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,407\nAnd then I will say, heck, yeah,\nI wanna do it, just go ahead and\n\n95\n00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:18,420\nget that put in place and\noff you go, right?\n\n96\n00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,960\nSo you can add that stuff.\n\n97\n00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,170\nA regular user can't do that though.\n\n98\n00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,530\nA regular user will get stopped and\nthey'll have to\n\n99\n00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,830\nprovide an administrator's username and\npassword to be able to do it, right?\n\n100\n00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,660\nSo they get that limitation.\n\n101\n00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,910\nSo from a convenience factor,\n\n102\n00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,330\nstaying logged in as an administrator\nall the time is pretty convenient.\n\n103\n00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,156\nBut here's the problem.\n\n104\n00:05:37,156 --> 00:05:42,007\nWhen you're logged in as an administrator\neverything you do is being run as\n\n105\n00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,321\nan administrator.\n\n106\n00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:47,160\nSo when you open up a Web browser,\nyou're opening it as an administrator.\n\n107\n00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,840\nWhen you open up a terminal prompt,\nwhen you copy files,\n\n108\n00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,200\nwhen you install an application,\nit's all being done as an administrator.\n\n109\n00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,310\nAnd so, if you go to a malicious website,\na website that has some kind of Java hack\n\n110\n00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,370\nbuilt into it, and it calls Java on your\nsystem, it's doing it as an administrator.\n\n111\n00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,400\nYou're empowering those\ntype of attacks to work.\n\n112\n00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,660\nIf you were logged in as a standard user,\nthose attacks wouldn't work.\n\n113\n00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,760\nSure, everything you do\nruns as your user account,\n\n114\n00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,140\nas a standard user, your Web browser,\nfile copies, all that stuff.\n\n115\n00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,900\nBut now if you go to\na malicious website and\n\n116\n00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,200\nit tries to launch a Java attack Java\nis running as your standard user.\n\n117\n00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,510\nAnd so it doesn't have the permissions\nto be able to modify the system.\n\n118\n00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,760\nSo it's less convenient to run as a\nstandard user, but it's a lot more secure.\n\n119\n00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,610\nSo Apple recommends that you\ndon't log in as an administrator\n\n120\n00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,890\nall the time unless this a home computer\nand you know what you're doing and\n\n121\n00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,490\nyou trust the sites that you go to.\n\n122\n00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,810\nThen it's okay.\n\n123\n00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,340\nBut for most people either they\ndon't know what they're doing or\n\n124\n00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,500\nthey don't trust the sites they go to,\nand it's better safe than sorry.\n\n125\n00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,750\nLog in as a standard user, all right?\n\n126\n00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,660\nBut that's not what\nthe initial setup does.\n\n127\n00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,430\nThe initial Initial setup, sets this up.\n\n128\n00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,870\nIt has an administrator, and it's because\nApple focuses on the convenient side\n\n129\n00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,030\nof that, cuz the typical Apple\nuser is not a business user.\n\n130\n00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,620\nThey're a home user, and\nthat's how that security is structured.\n\n131\n00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,300\nSo in the business environment you have to\nget people out of that habit, all right?\n\n132\n00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,090\nAnd the way we get them out of that habit,\n\n133\n00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,990\nis by not giving the administrator\naccount in the first place.\n\n134\n00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,520\nWhen I did this install that first account\nI created I could have called it Don Pezet\n\n135\n00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,050\nand I could have just used it.\n\n136\n00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,720\nBut instead I called it help desk.\n\n137\n00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,670\nAnd the reason is I only want my help\ndesk to know what my password is.\n\n138\n00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,213\nAnd instead I'm gonna go here\ninto my System Preferences and\n\n139\n00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:28,570\nI'm gonna go down to Users and Groups.\n\n140\n00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,430\nAnd in my Users and Groups I see that help\ndesk right there, flagged as an admin,\n\n141\n00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,980\nand I'm gonna add another account.\n\n142\n00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,210\nThat will be my standard user,\nmy regular user account.\n\n143\n00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,070\nAll right,\nnow notice how this screen is locked.\n\n144\n00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,240\nYou have to be an administrator\nto work with these user accounts.\n\n145\n00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840\nAnd so down here, we've got that lock.\n\n146\n00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,876\nClick the lock to make changes.\n\n147\n00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:51,738\nI'm gonna click that, and\nit's asking for my user and password for\n\n148\n00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,375\nmy administrator account.\n\n149\n00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,813\nSo I have to prove that\nI'm an administrator.\n\n150\n00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:59,005\nJust because I am logged in as\nthe administrator doesn't mean I can\n\n151\n00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:01,350\njust rapidly jump in and do these things.\n\n152\n00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,050\nI still have to authenticate it.\n\n153\n00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,710\nIt's a safety net because\nI might have gotten up and\n\n154\n00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,400\nwalked away from my computer.\n\n155\n00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,220\nAnd someone else ran up, and\nsat down and started to do something.\n\n156\n00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,410\nWell it's gonna prompt them for\nthat own password.\n\n157\n00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,660\nSo just because I left it unlocked\ndoesn't mean they can get in and\n\n158\n00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,270\ndo it whenever they want.\n\n159\n00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,591\nAlright, well, now my buttons have lit up,\nI can come in and i can add an account, so\n\n160\n00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:24,860\nI'm gonna hit the little plus sign and\nI'm gonna add an account for me.\n\n161\n00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,500\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n162\n00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,067\nI'm gonna add in Don Pezet and under the\naccount type, I'm gonna choose standard,\n\n163\n00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:31,130\nall right.\n\n164\n00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,030\nNow, the standard account\ntype is not an administrator.\n\n165\n00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,230\nIt can't do a ton of things on the system.\n\n166\n00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,200\nThey're pretty limited.\n\n167\n00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,010\nSo, i'm gonna create this account.\n\n168\n00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,472\nAnd here's my choice, where I can do the\niCloud password or a separate password.\n\n169\n00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:48,660\nI'm gonna do a separate for right now,\nI don't want to link iCloud, but\n\n170\n00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,530\nI'll just go ahead and\nget this account created.\n\n171\n00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,140\nAnd I'll provide a password.\n\n172\n00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,820\nAnd we're gonna revisit these\nsettings a little bit later.\n\n173\n00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,420\nI'm just trying to get an account\ncreated real quick here.\n\n174\n00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,840\nSo I'll create that user.\n\n175\n00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,240\nAnd now,\nI've got Help Desk that's an admin,\n\n176\n00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,150\nand I've got Don Pezet as a standard user,\nall right.\n\n177\n00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:12,317\nAnd if I log out,\nI can log back in as Don Pezet.\n\n178\n00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:15,510\nSo I'm just gonna log out.\n\n179\n00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,150\nAnd we'll log in as Don.\n\n180\n00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,580\nNow, when I log in as Don,\n\n181\n00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,140\nit's really gonna look the same as it did\nwhen I was logged in as an administrator.\n\n182\n00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,040\nI'm gonna log in.\n\n183\n00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,381\nAnd I'll see my Yosemite background cuz\nit's a brand new profile, all right.\n\n184\n00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:30,430\nNothing customized about it.\n\n185\n00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,440\nI'll get logged in, here I am,\nworking in the system, right?\n\n186\n00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,878\nWell, if I try and do something\nlike the administrators did, right?\n\n187\n00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:43,454\nI can go up to my system preferences,\nand I can go to users and groups, right?\n\n188\n00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:45,000\nJust like an administrator did.\n\n189\n00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,410\nAnd everything's kinda great out here.\n\n190\n00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,100\nAnd I've got that click\nlock to make changes.\n\n191\n00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,220\nIf I click that lock, well I'm Don Pezet.\n\n192\n00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,170\nI'm not that administrator I can't do it.\n\n193\n00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,820\nSo I can provide credentials for\nsomebody who can, right.\n\n194\n00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,280\nNow if I were to launch a web browser\nright now, it's running as Don Pezet.\n\n195\n00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,530\nIf I went to the finder,\nit's running as Don Pezet.\n\n196\n00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,760\nIf I open a terminal prompt,\nit's running as Don Pezet.\n\n197\n00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,800\nThey're all running as standard users.\n\n198\n00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,440\nAnd when it comes time for\nme to do an administrative action.\n\n199\n00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,920\nIt'll prompt me and I can come in here and\nI can say, I'm gonna log in as Help Desk\n\n200\n00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,610\nand I'll punch in the password for\nHelp Desk and unlock.\n\n201\n00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,890\nAnd now I'm able to make\nchanges to this screen.\n\n202\n00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:29,040\nI'm still logged in as Don Pezet, but\nnow I'm doing actions here as Help Desk.\n\n203\n00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,720\nBut it's just this one window,\njust this window right here is Help Desk.\n\n204\n00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,140\nIf I go and open up Safari and\nI start to do actions here in Safari,\n\n205\n00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,410\nthat's running as Don Pezet,\nthat's running as a standard user.\n\n206\n00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,150\nFrom a security perspective,\nthat's a big deal, right?\n\n207\n00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,360\nThat makes a big difference.\n\n208\n00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,810\nMy average routine daily activities are\nnot done as an administrator and that's\n\n209\n00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,040\na standard security practice, regardless\nof what operating system you're running,\n\n210\n00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,770\nif you're running Windows or Linux.\n\n211\n00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,020\nIt's the same thing.\n\n212\n00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,290\nHere in Mac they just\nmake it real easy right?\n\n213\n00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,870\nWe just make that other user account and\nlog in as that.\n\n214\n00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,830\nSo one of the first things\nwe need to remember for\n\n215\n00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,050\nthe exam is that there's two\nprimary types of user account.\n\n216\n00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,940\nAdministrator and standard user.\n\n217\n00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,790\nAnd the second thing we should\nremember is that we should always\n\n218\n00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,620\nlog in as a standard user.\n\n219\n00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,630\nAnd only use the administrator\naccount when we have to.\n\n220\n00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,680\nBecause of the security benefit,\nall right?\n\n221\n00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,750\nIt's less convenient,\nbut it's more secure.\n\n222\n00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,220\nDon't negate the other way though.\n\n223\n00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,340\nYou might choose to always use\nthe administrator account.\n\n224\n00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,520\nIt's more convenient, but\nit's less secure, right?\n\n225\n00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,160\nIt's a trade off.\n\n226\n00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,890\nYou're basically picking which\none is important to you, and\n\n227\n00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,470\nthe choice is ultimately up to you.\n\n228\n00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,800\nAlright now I mentioned there's\ntwo primary type of user accounts:\n\n229\n00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,140\nadministrator, standard user.\n\n230\n00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,230\nWell there's actually five different\ntypes of accounts altogether.\n\n231\n00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,581\nBut those two, those are the ones\nthat most of us are gonna use.\n\n232\n00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:52,095\nWe're rarely gonna use the other\ntypes that are out there,\n\n233\n00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:54,515\nbut let's cover them because\nthey might turn up on the exam.\n\n234\n00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:58,940\nWhen I came in to add my user account,\nright, this standard user,\n\n235\n00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,520\nwhen I added it,\nit asked me a series of questions.\n\n236\n00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,527\nThese questions are what\nare called user attributes.\n\n237\n00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:08,797\nSo I'm specifying various attributes for\nmy user account.\n\n238\n00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:12,597\nAnd the very first attribute\nis what kind of account it is.\n\n239\n00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:16,407\nAnd if I drop that list down, I'll see\nthe five different types of account.\n\n240\n00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:18,397\nAdministrator and Standard User,\nthose are the first two.\n\n241\n00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:20,517\nThose are the important ones, right.\n\n242\n00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:23,917\nBut after that I've got Managed\nwith Parental Controls.\n\n243\n00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,920\nAll right, what's that all about.\n\n244\n00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,950\nWell, I'm goinna talk about parental\ncontrols a little bit later.\n\n245\n00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,900\nBut basically this is a standard user.\n\n246\n00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,800\nIt's the same as\nthe standard user above it.\n\n247\n00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,509\nExcept if we configure parental controls,\nthey'll apply to this account,\n\n248\n00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:40,257\nwhereas they wouldn't apply\nto the other ones, right.\n\n249\n00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:44,530\nThe parental controls, just to kinda do\na quick summary, they allow us to restrict\n\n250\n00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,890\nwhat websites somebody can get to,\nrestrict what applications they can run.\n\n251\n00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,710\nRestrict what times they're\nallowed to use the computer and\n\n252\n00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,190\nwhat time the computer is to shut\ndown at the end of the night.\n\n253\n00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,490\nWe can set up things that the average\nparent would need to control for\n\n254\n00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,630\ntheir children.\n\n255\n00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,155\nSo manage with parental controls is\nreally designed for children, right?\n\n256\n00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:06,576\nThe parents might log in as\nan administrator or a standard user, and\n\n257\n00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:10,357\nthen they set the parental controls\nto control the children's accounts,\n\n258\n00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:12,590\nwhich are managed with parental controls.\n\n259\n00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,225\nNow, it doesn't mean it\nhas to be children, right?\n\n260\n00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:18,850\nIt could be high school students,\nit could even be older people but\n\n261\n00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,750\nwe want to control their access, right?\n\n262\n00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,900\nSo that's really what that's all about.\n\n263\n00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,400\nAnd you'll see if I choose Manage with\nParental Controls the screen doesn't\n\n264\n00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,390\nreally change, does it?\n\n265\n00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,450\nIf I choose Standard it doesn't change.\n\n266\n00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,685\nIf I choose Administrator\nit doesn't change.\n\n267\n00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:36,015\nThe actual properties of\nthe user are the same.\n\n268\n00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,553\nIt's just how that user's permissions\nare set that's different.\n\n269\n00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:43,125\nThe fourth type of\naccount is sharing only.\n\n270\n00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,482\nNow sharing only is a neat one, all right?\n\n271\n00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:49,482\nWhen I create an administrator, or\na standard user, or a manageable parental\n\n272\n00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:54,122\ncontrols, those users can walk right up to\nthat computer, sit down and log in, right?\n\n273\n00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:55,992\nThey have physical\naccess to that computer.\n\n274\n00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:58,022\nThey can sit down,\nlog in on it and access resources.\n\n275\n00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:02,062\nIf I'm sharing folders\non the network though,\n\n276\n00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:05,192\nthey can log in on another computer and\naccess the folder remotely.\n\n277\n00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,240\nThey can do both.\n\n278\n00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,040\nYour normal users, administrator,\nstandard, manager with parental controls,\n\n279\n00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,640\ncan access the computer while\nthey're sitting at it, and\n\n280\n00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,610\naccess it via the network.\n\n281\n00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,560\nWell you might wanna share a folder out so\nthat other people can access it, but\n\n282\n00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,800\nyou might not want them to be able\nto log in on your computer itself.\n\n283\n00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,470\nI don't want them to use my laptop, but\n\n284\n00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,040\nI want them to be able to\nget to my folder, right?\n\n285\n00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,710\nSo in that scenario,\nyou would create a sharing only account.\n\n286\n00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,060\nSo let's say that Nate,\nour producer, right?\n\n287\n00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,860\nHe's sitting off screen here,\nif I want him to have my show notes for\n\n288\n00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,090\ntoday's episodes and I know those\nshow notes are in a folder right\n\n289\n00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,760\nhere on my Mac, I might share\nthose out and give Nate access.\n\n290\n00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,870\nWell, I don't want him to be able\nto sit down and use my laptop.\n\n291\n00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,210\nBut I do want him to get to the notes.\n\n292\n00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,910\nSo I might create a sharing only account,\nand\n\n293\n00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:54,390\nthat'll let him log in via the network\nto connect and get those files.\n\n294\n00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,572\nBut if he sat down and tried to log\ninto my laptop, it wouldn't let him.\n\n295\n00:14:57,572 --> 00:15:01,750\nSharing only is not allowed to log\nin locally to the system, right?\n\n296\n00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,870\nIf you're not sharing files,\nthese accounts are pointless, and\n\n297\n00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,770\nyou don't really use them.\n\n298\n00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,200\nBut that's what sharing only is for.\n\n299\n00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,310\nNow the fifth type of account\nreally isn't a user account at all.\n\n300\n00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,140\nIt is on the back end, the way that Mac OS\nstores it and that's why it's here, but\n\n301\n00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,185\nthe way we use it this\nis not really a user.\n\n302\n00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,225\nThis is what's called a group.\n\n303\n00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:27,235\nWhen we create a group,\na group is a collection of users.\n\n304\n00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:31,095\nAnd when you do that you will notice for\nthe first time, the attributes change.\n\n305\n00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:32,570\nThe attributes were the same for\nthe other four types.\n\n306\n00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,752\nFor this one, it's just a name.\n\n307\n00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:37,582\nLet's give it a name that's it, all right?\n\n308\n00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:39,412\nNow, what is the point of a group?\n\n309\n00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:41,932\nIf you use your computer,\n\n310\n00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:44,912\nyou're the only one that uses\nthe computer, groups are pointless.\n\n311\n00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:46,933\nYou might as well not have them,\nall right?\n\n312\n00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:51,500\nBut what if you have a family computer or\nif this is a computer lab for a school,\n\n313\n00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,000\nright?\n\n314\n00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,034\nLet's run with that example.\n\n315\n00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:54,578\nSo I've got a computer lab for a school.\n\n316\n00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,104\nAnd I've got a class of twenty students.\n\n317\n00:15:57,104 --> 00:16:01,227\nAnd so any of those twenty students could\nbe using this computer at any given time,\n\n318\n00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,360\nall right?\n\n319\n00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,970\nWell, if I have a folder, and I want to\ngive those students permission to access\n\n320\n00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,455\nthe folder, I don't want to have to\ngo through and add all 20 students.\n\n321\n00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:13,845\nInstead what I can do is I can put\nthe 20 students in a group, and\n\n322\n00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:18,695\nthen I can get the permissions to\nthe group instead of the individual user.\n\n323\n00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:22,697\nAnd that's nice because as students\ngraduate, move on to the next class I can\n\n324\n00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:26,377\ntake them out of the Group and I can take\nthe next class and put them into the Group\n\n325\n00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:29,857\nand now they've got the same\npermissions as the first batch, right?\n\n326\n00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:33,927\nSo it really makes it easy to manage\npermissions and access by using the Group.\n\n327\n00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:37,257\nAnd so I might create\na Group Called Lab Students and\n\n328\n00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:42,540\nI'll create that Group and\nnow I've got this group right here.\n\n329\n00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,130\nAnd see how I get a list of users?\n\n330\n00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,070\nAnd I just check off\nwho's going to be in it.\n\n331\n00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,790\nAnd so if I check off Don Pezet right?\n\n332\n00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,080\nDon Pezet is in the lab students group.\n\n333\n00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,530\nNow I can go and\nassign permissions to that group, or\n\n334\n00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,820\ndo whatever I want to that group.\n\n335\n00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,940\nAnd if I get some new student in,\nI'll use Nate again, so I come in here and\n\n336\n00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,360\ncreate a standard user for Nate.\n\n337\n00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,020\nI'm going to manage him\na parental control.\n\n338\n00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,148\nSo we'll punch him in here,\nas Nate Copeland, and\n\n339\n00:17:11,148 --> 00:17:17,525\nwe'll give him a dedicated\npassword All right.\n\n340\n00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:20,555\nSo we got him and\nwe've created his user account and\n\n341\n00:17:20,555 --> 00:17:24,195\nnow when I go into that lab student's\ngroup, he shows up there, right.\n\n342\n00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:27,775\nAnd I can check him and now he and\nI are both in that lab students group.\n\n343\n00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:30,765\nAny permissions that I assigned to\nthe group before, he now gets, too, right,\n\n344\n00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:34,410\nor whatever access I've done,\nhe gets that same access.\n\n345\n00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,290\nThat's the whole point of a group.\n\n346\n00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,690\nIt makes managing access\na lot more convenient.\n\n347\n00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,120\nAll right.\nSo let's recap\n\n348\n00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,970\nthose because these do\nshow up on the exams.\n\n349\n00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,960\nWhen we go to create a user account\nthere's five types of accounts we\n\n350\n00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,930\ncan create.\n\n351\n00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,380\nThere's the administrator account that has\nfull, unfettered access to the system.\n\n352\n00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,390\nThere's a standard user that\nhas access to the system but\n\n353\n00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,420\ncan't perform system live changes.\n\n354\n00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,800\nThere's management parental controls.\n\n355\n00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,430\nThat is basically a standard user, but has\nthe parental restrictions applied to it.\n\n356\n00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,120\nAnd then there's the sharing only account,\n\n357\n00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,840\nwhich is only able to access\nthe system via the network.\n\n358\n00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,670\nCan't access the system locally,\notherwise it's basically a standard user.\n\n359\n00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,350\nAnd then the last one was saw was a Group.\n\n360\n00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,120\nThe group that's a collection\nof user accounts,\n\n361\n00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,350\nit's not necessarily a user account in and\nof itself.\n\n362\n00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,360\nSo those are the five types of accounts\nthat we'll see inside of user and\n\n363\n00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:25,960\naccount settings.\n\n364\n00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,720\nYou definitely want to be\nfamiliar with those for the exam.\n\n365\n00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,130\nAll right, there is one other thing that I\nwant to throw in here that might turn up.\n\n366\n00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,020\nI don't know if they get this nitpicky or\nnot anymore.\n\n367\n00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,300\nBut there is another difference\nwith the sharing only account.\n\n368\n00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,860\nWhen you create a normal user account,\n\n369\n00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,290\nthey get what's called a home directory,\nright.\n\n370\n00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,190\nIf you were to browse on your hard drive.\n\n371\n00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,930\nOn your Mac's hard drive\nthere's a folder called users.\n\n372\n00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,900\nAnd inside of users each user you\ncreate gets their own folder.\n\n373\n00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,060\nSo see I've got Don Pezet help\ndesk Nathan Copeland right?\n\n374\n00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,940\nThey're all right here.\n\n375\n00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,710\nWell you've got administrator standard\nuser and manage your parental controls.\n\n376\n00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,430\nRight?\nThere's those three guys.\n\n377\n00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:12,280\nIf I create a sharing only account\nlike maybe our director, right?\n\n378\n00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,630\nSo I want Jason to have account here, but\n\n379\n00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,120\nI just want him to access\nstuff via the network.\n\n380\n00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,260\nSo I might come in here and add one.\n\n381\n00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,440\nAnd I'll come in and say that this\nis sharing only account, right?\n\n382\n00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,330\nSo I'll punch in Jason Phillips,\nhe's got an account,\n\n383\n00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,230\nI give him a password,\nand it's sharing only.\n\n384\n00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,160\nWhen I create that user account, he's now\ngot an account, and it picked a rose for\n\n385\n00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,090\nhis picture, isn't that appropriate?\n\n386\n00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,560\nSo anyhow, it's got his account created,\nit's right there, If I go back and\n\n387\n00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,610\nlook at my hard drive.\n\n388\n00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,490\nHere, I'll even browse out and browse back\nin just to make sure it's the latest.\n\n389\n00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,970\nNotice how we didn't get a folder, right?\n\n390\n00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,910\nA sharing only account\ndoesn't get a home folder.\n\n391\n00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,460\nThey don't need one.\n\n392\n00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,730\nThey're not going to log in locally.\n\n393\n00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,420\nThey don't have any documents or\nprofile settings.\n\n394\n00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,730\nThey don't have any of that stuff.\n\n395\n00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,730\nThey're coming in via the network, right?\n\n396\n00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,780\nSo they don't need a profile,\nthey don't get a home directory.\n\n397\n00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,410\nSo that's another difference with\na sharing account that I didn't\n\n398\n00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:06,990\nmention earlier.\n\n399\n00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,240\nAll right, well now that we've\nseen the five types of accounts,\n\n400\n00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,590\nI want to talk more about the attributes\nthat we set and what they do.\n\n401\n00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,890\nAnd a few other features that go\nalong with user accounts as we secure\n\n402\n00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,870\nour systems.\n\n403\n00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,190\nBut this is a pretty good spot to stop and\ntake a break.\n\n404\n00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,590\nSo why don't we pause here and\n\n405\n00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,520\nwhen we get back, we'll dive more\ninto the accounts themselves.\n\n406\n00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,131\nSo stay tuned, we're back after this.\n\n407\n00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:36,674\n[SOUND] All right welcome back everybody.\n\n408\n00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:40,627\nSo in the first segment we took a look\nat creating some user accounts and\n\n409\n00:20:40,627 --> 00:20:43,290\nI mentioned the user account attributes.\n\n410\n00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,140\nLet's take another look at those to make\nsure we got a good understanding of what's\n\n411\n00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,842\ninvolved in creating\nthat new user account.\n\n412\n00:20:48,842 --> 00:20:52,820\nAll right so I'm back here in my users and\ngroups so I went to system preferences and\n\n413\n00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,280\nusers and groups.\n\n414\n00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,400\nAnd I'm just going to add\nanother account in here.\n\n415\n00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,870\nAnd when we add an account,\nwe pick that type.\n\n416\n00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,530\nI'll do a standard user.\n\n417\n00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,960\nAnd then we have to provide\nthe attributes for the user.\n\n418\n00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,340\nThere are three required attributes.\n\n419\n00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,050\nThere's actually a ton of other attributes\nthat we just don't see here on this screen\n\n420\n00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,230\nthat you'll definitely see when\nwe get into Open Directory or\n\n421\n00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,170\nwhatever in later series.\n\n422\n00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,060\nBut for here, we've got three\nmain attributes that we need.\n\n423\n00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,650\nThe first one is a full name.\n\n424\n00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,310\nThe full name,\nsome people call it the display name.\n\n425\n00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,380\nIt's the friendly name that\nrepresents a user account.\n\n426\n00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,330\nThis is what we see in the graphical\nuser interface of Mac OS.\n\n427\n00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,130\nAll right.\n\n428\n00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,600\nNow the friendly name can contain\na lot of special characters.\n\n429\n00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,870\nIt can have accents in it,\nit can have spaces in the name.\n\n430\n00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,060\nIt can have all sorts of variation.\n\n431\n00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:44,550\nBut remember that under the hood,\nMac OS is a Unix-like operating system and\n\n432\n00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,290\nUnix hates spaces in a username.\n\n433\n00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,880\nAnd there's certain rules that\napply to Unix-based usernames.\n\n434\n00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,880\nSo every user account\nactually has two names.\n\n435\n00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,570\nYou've got the friendly name, this full\nname right here that looks nice and neat.\n\n436\n00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,990\nAnd then you've got the account name.\n\n437\n00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,660\nAnd the account name is what the Unix\n\n438\n00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,860\nlayer underneath is actually\nusing to manage your account.\n\n439\n00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,520\nAll right?\n\n440\n00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,000\nSo depending on what you're doing you\nmay actually see one or the other.\n\n441\n00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,540\nFor the most part,\nyou'll see the friendly name, though.\n\n442\n00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,070\nSo, like, if I create an account here for\nChristopher Walken, right?\n\n443\n00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,440\nSo I'll get him an account.\n\n444\n00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,030\nI'm typing in, I've got capital letters,\nlowercase letters, a space, and\n\n445\n00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,510\nit's all happy.\n\n446\n00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,780\nWhen I click on account name,\nit's going to recommend a name for him.\n\n447\n00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,600\nAnd look what it did.\n\n448\n00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,850\nIt removed the space, and\nit made it all lowercase.\n\n449\n00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,760\nIt made the name very Unix friendly,\nall right?\n\n450\n00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,980\nSo that's fine.\n\n451\n00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,990\nWe may look at that and go I don't\nwant to log in as that, that's a mess.\n\n452\n00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,900\nBut that's what Unix is going to use, and\n\n453\n00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,060\nit's going to be perfectly\nhappy with that.\n\n454\n00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,120\nAll right.\nThen it asks if this is going to be\n\n455\n00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,350\nan iCloud account.\n\n456\n00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,260\nAnd if so, I would put in my iCloud ID.\n\n457\n00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,850\nOn the next screen it'll prompt for\nthat password.\n\n458\n00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,070\nOr I could say use a separate\npassword just for this account.\n\n459\n00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,370\nNow you can still link to your icloud,\neven if you're using a separate password.\n\n460\n00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:07,870\nWhat you're really saying here is, do I\nwant to share my password with icloud.\n\n461\n00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,600\nNow why would I want to do that?\n\n462\n00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,900\nWhy would I want to do the same?\n\n463\n00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,570\nWell there's two reasons.\n\n464\n00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:17,010\nThe first reason is convenience,\nif you use the same password on your Mac\n\n465\n00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:21,680\nas you do in iCloud, then when you\nlog into iCloud via the website, or\n\n466\n00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,150\nyou log into your Mac or you login on\nyour iPhone or your iPad, it's the same\n\n467\n00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,640\npassword across all of the devices and\nif you change the password on one of them,\n\n468\n00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,700\nit's changed on all of them, so\nit's password synchronization.\n\n469\n00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,960\nRight?\n\n470\n00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,110\nOn a negative side,\nif your iCloud password gets compromised,\n\n471\n00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,930\nsomebody could login on your iPhone,\nor your iPad, or your desktop.\n\n472\n00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,540\nIt's all linked together.\n\n473\n00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,910\nSo it's kind of the pros and cons, right?\n\n474\n00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,630\nBut one of the big\nadvantages of linking them.\n\n475\n00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,714\nIs that if you forget your password.\n\n476\n00:23:51,714 --> 00:23:54,232\nIf you forget your password on a Mac,\nyou can get locked out and\n\n477\n00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:57,693\nthere's a password recovery procedure\nwhich we'll talk about a little bit later.\n\n478\n00:23:57,693 --> 00:23:59,690\nBut you can lock yourself out.\n\n479\n00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,638\nAnd if that happens, you've got\nto go through password recovery.\n\n480\n00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:06,482\nWell, if it's linked to your iCloud,\nyou can just go to the Apple site and\n\n481\n00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:10,780\nyou can do the Apple ID maintenance and\nrecover your password through your email.\n\n482\n00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,820\nSo, it's easy to recover that\npassword using iCloud and Apple IDs.\n\n483\n00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,330\nVersus on the Mac,\nwhere we have to boot into recovery, and\n\n484\n00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,210\ngo into that process to\nrecover our password.\n\n485\n00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,620\nIt's a little bit more involved.\n\n486\n00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,680\nSo, in my case, though, I'm gonna go\nahead and use a separate password again.\n\n487\n00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,270\nNow, up until this point,\nI've just been typing a password.\n\n488\n00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,720\nBut you might have noticed this little\nbutton over here with a key on it.\n\n489\n00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,980\nThat's the password assistant.\n\n490\n00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,240\nIt will help you pick a secure password.\n\n491\n00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,780\nIf you click on that, you'll see\nsome different suggestions come up.\n\n492\n00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,760\nThis little password assistant window.\n\n493\n00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,350\nAnd it's got several types of\npasswords you can choose from.\n\n494\n00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,572\nA memorable password,\none that's complex but easy to remember.\n\n495\n00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:55,860\nLetters and numbers, one that's a random\nmixture of letters and numbers.\n\n496\n00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,970\nNumbers only, it'll just be made\nup of a numerical sequence.\n\n497\n00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,620\nAnd then,\nrandom It'll be made up of numbers\n\n498\n00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,376\nletters special characters\nall in a randomized sequence.\n\n499\n00:25:05,376 --> 00:25:08,404\nAnd then, there's FIPS-181 compliant.\n\n500\n00:25:08,404 --> 00:25:12,631\nThat's a US regulation that\nwas passed a long time ago.\n\n501\n00:25:12,631 --> 00:25:13,680\nAnd it's terrible.\n\n502\n00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,030\nIt's not terribly secure.\n\n503\n00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,970\nBut you can choose that to generate\na FIPS-181 compliant password.\n\n504\n00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,750\nAnd as you choose these, you'll see it\nstarting to generate possible passwords.\n\n505\n00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:27,220\nAnd I know it's kinda small on the screen,\nbut this first one here, it's generated.\n\n506\n00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,060\nI did the FIPS-181.\n\n507\n00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,040\nIt's all lowercase, it's all letters, and\n\n508\n00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,540\nit's msiapsinquud.\n\n509\n00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,130\nNo actual words to be found in there.\n\n510\n00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,950\nJust random string.\n\n511\n00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:45,090\nIt did 12 characters by the length by\ndefault, and the quality is pretty low.\n\n512\n00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,560\nIt's telling me it's not\na great quality password.\n\n513\n00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,170\nIf I switch to random,\nnow it's 12 characters,\n\n514\n00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,200\nthere's some special characters I've got,\nit looks like apostrophe,\n\n515\n00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,570\nexclamation point, slash, E,\nblah blah blah, uppercase, lowercase.\n\n516\n00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,310\nThis is a good one.\n\n517\n00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,630\nI got a good quality on the the password.\n\n518\n00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,790\nBut I'm never gonna remember that.\n\n519\n00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:09,810\nIf I choose numbers only or\nletters only, letters and numbers.\n\n520\n00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,160\nIt's like the name implies.\n\n521\n00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,320\nIf I go to memorable though, now it'll\nmix some kind of word into there.\n\n522\n00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,150\nSo, here I've got M-O-A-T, which is moat.\n\n523\n00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,500\nOne zero, open parentheses, hefty.\n\n524\n00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,610\nSo, moat and hefty,\nthose are normal words, and\n\n525\n00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,580\nthen some special characters\nthrown into the middle.\n\n526\n00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,540\nIt gets good complexity, but\nit's a little easier to remember.\n\n527\n00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,850\nSo, if you're having a hard\ntime coming up with a password,\n\n528\n00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,290\nyou can use the password\nassistant to help generate one.\n\n529\n00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,402\nNow, I'm never gonna remember either of\nthose, so I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n530\n00:26:39,402 --> 00:26:40,250\njust punch in my own.\n\n531\n00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,070\nThere we go.\nAnd then, you can provide a hint.\n\n532\n00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,960\nNow, a hint is not required.\n\n533\n00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,560\nIf somebody tries to log in and\n\n534\n00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,880\nthey put in the wrong password,\nthen the password hint is displayed.\n\n535\n00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,050\nIt says, hey, you got it wrong.\n\n536\n00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,550\nHere's a hint.\n\n537\n00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,240\nIf it's linked to iCloud,\nnotice how I don't have that hint option.\n\n538\n00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,780\nWhat happens is if you try and\nlog in and you get it wrong and\n\n539\n00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,710\nyou're using iCloud,\na different message will pop up saying,\n\n540\n00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,930\nhey, you can reset your\npassword if you'd like.\n\n541\n00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,990\nAnd you can hit it and it'll cause iCloud\nto send an email to the email address\n\n542\n00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,850\nlinked to your Apple ID to take you\ninto the password reset process.\n\n543\n00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,220\nSo, a little bit different there.\n\n544\n00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,120\nThe hint is just for\nlocal passwords [SOUND].\n\n545\n00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,081\nAnd so,\nyou can punch in whatever that hint is.\n\n546\n00:27:24,081 --> 00:27:28,890\nIt is your standard password or whatever.\n\n547\n00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,540\nI personally usually leave this empty.\n\n548\n00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,090\nI don't like to put hints in.\n\n549\n00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,180\nIf somebody sits down on the computer and\ntries to log in as me, and they get\n\n550\n00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,610\nthe wrong password, do I wanna give\nthem a hint as to what my password is?\n\n551\n00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,280\nNo.\n\n552\n00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,660\nSo, you either wanna put something\ncompletely cryptic in here or\n\n553\n00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,640\njust leave it blank.\n\n554\n00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,600\nYou can leave it empty and\nthat is what I normally do.\n\n555\n00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,780\nSo, those are the main attributes for\nthe user account.\n\n556\n00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,050\nWhen you create the user account,\nit gets made, it gets put in place, and\n\n557\n00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,160\nthose attributes are now set.\n\n558\n00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,270\nWhen we take a look at the user\naccount though, looking at it here,\n\n559\n00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,838\nI really don't see a lot\nof those attributes.\n\n560\n00:28:01,838 --> 00:28:04,440\nHere's the username,\nhere's the password, they are there but\n\n561\n00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,680\nthere's other attributes like the icon.\n\n562\n00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,574\nThe icon, I got a soccer ball, apparently,\nis what I'm gonna go with here.\n\n563\n00:28:10,574 --> 00:28:13,837\nAnd you can change that to something else,\ngo to your photo stream or\n\n564\n00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:17,168\nI guess you could probably pull it\nfrom your camera if you wanted.\n\n565\n00:28:17,168 --> 00:28:20,650\nHere, let's try and get myself.\n\n566\n00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,850\nHere, I'll even smile.\n\n567\n00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,870\nThere we go.\n\n568\n00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,610\nOh, no, I gotta wait for that countdown.\n\n569\n00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,080\nThis is gonna turn out terrible.\n\n570\n00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,170\nThere we go.\n\n571\n00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,360\nAnd so, we can go.\n\n572\n00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,590\nWhoa, argh.\n\n573\n00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,070\nThat was more than any of us\nwanted to see right there.\n\n574\n00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,720\nThere we go, so now we've got\na goofball picture of me on the set.\n\n575\n00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,640\nNow, I got my own picture in here,\nisn't that awesome?\n\n576\n00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,580\nSo, you can get a picture put in place,\nthat's a user attribute also.\n\n577\n00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,840\nWe didn't see that when creating it,\nwe just saw the required one, so\n\n578\n00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,140\nthose are the ones we had to have.\n\n579\n00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,230\nThese are optional.\n\n580\n00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,630\nYou can do an optional picture\nif you want, you don't have to.\n\n581\n00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:56,190\nYou also have the contacts card where you\ncan provide even more information about\n\n582\n00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,980\nthem like mailing address and so on.\n\n583\n00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,760\nThose are attributes too but\nagain not required.\n\n584\n00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,750\nNow, notice how I created\nmyself as a standard user and\n\n585\n00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,790\nnot as a managed by\nparental controls user.\n\n586\n00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,480\nIf I flip back and\nforth between these two,\n\n587\n00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,880\nthe big difference between a standard\nuser and managed by parental controls is\n\n588\n00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,920\nthis little check mark right here\nthat says, enable parental controls.\n\n589\n00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,020\nSo, you can actually turn\nthat on after the fact\n\n590\n00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,290\nto secure the account a little more.\n\n591\n00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,470\nSo, if I decide that I want\nChristopher Walken to be controlled,\n\n592\n00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,030\nI can check that off to enable it and\nsee how he changed to managed.\n\n593\n00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,940\nSo, I'm actually changing\nthat type after the fact.\n\n594\n00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,660\nAnd if I do allow user to\nadminister the system,\n\n595\n00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,780\nthat's gonna change him\nto an administrator.\n\n596\n00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:44,280\nSo, I can move them between administrator,\nstandard user, and\n\n597\n00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,480\nmanaged by parental controls,\nwhatever I want.\n\n598\n00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,970\nBe careful.\n\n599\n00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,590\nYou always need to have at\nleast one administrator.\n\n600\n00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,320\nYou don't want to end up in a situation\nwhere you have no administrator account.\n\n601\n00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,150\nSo, if I were to take my admins and\nuncheck that allow administer, and\n\n602\n00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:03,910\nend up with no admins, I could get\na system where I'm unable to control it.\n\n603\n00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,050\nI'm unable to manage it.\n\n604\n00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,459\nWe have to go into recovery to fix that.\n\n605\n00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:13,470\nNow, I mentioned a friendly name, and\nhow that's what we're normally gonna see.\n\n606\n00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,530\nWhen don't we see the friendly name?\n\n607\n00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,930\nWell, we don't see the friendly name\nwhen we're browsing the file system,\n\n608\n00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,990\nthat user directory that\nI was talking about.\n\n609\n00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:27,950\nIf I launch my finder, over here I've\ngot my documents, desktop, applications,\n\n610\n00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,565\nall these folders that are useful to me,\nmany of which are stored in my profile.\n\n611\n00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:39,020\nBut when I go to all my files and\nstuff, all these things\n\n612\n00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,510\nare stored in a folder on the hard drive\nthat's actually tied to my Unix name.\n\n613\n00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,850\nIf I go to Macintosh HD and\nI browse into users,\n\n614\n00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:51,040\nI don't see Don Pisette with a space in\nit, I see don pisette all lower case.\n\n615\n00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,460\nIt's that Unix user name right,\n\n616\n00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,150\nthe account name is what's\nshowing up in there.\n\n617\n00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,680\nIf I were to fire up the terminal.\n\n618\n00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,270\nSo, here I am in the terminal and\nI were to run a command like who am I.\n\n619\n00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,859\nIt's gonna return that I am Don Pezet and\n\n620\n00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:10,280\nit's gonna return that account name,\nnot the friendly name.\n\n621\n00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,260\nSo, that account name is gonna\nturn up from time to time.\n\n622\n00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,547\nMost of the end users never notice it.\n\n623\n00:31:17,357 --> 00:31:21,858\nNow, I mentioned that you could always\npotentially lock yourself out of\n\n624\n00:31:21,858 --> 00:31:23,630\nthe system.\n\n625\n00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,100\nWell, that leads to another point that I\nwanna make which is, as we create user\n\n626\n00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,010\naccounts, there's actually a few special\nuser accounts that are created for us.\n\n627\n00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,950\nYou've probably already noticed one, it's\nright here on the screen, the guest user.\n\n628\n00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,549\nWhen you install Mac OS, the default is it\ncreates one administrative user for you,\n\n629\n00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:44,999\nbut when you login, you'll see there's\nactually a second user, the guest account.\n\n630\n00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:47,591\nAnd the guest account\nis disabled by default.\n\n631\n00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:48,400\nIt's not working.\n\n632\n00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,258\nSee how the account, it says off?\n\n633\n00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:52,440\nThe account's not functioning.\n\n634\n00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,539\nWhat the guest account is designed for\n\n635\n00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:57,930\nis to provide anonymous\naccess to your system.\n\n636\n00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:02,410\nLet's say you work for an elementary\nschool and you wanted to allow\n\n637\n00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:06,340\nthe kids to come into this learning lab\nand sit at the computers and use them, and\n\n638\n00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,380\nyou didn't want them to have to\ndo a user name and password.\n\n639\n00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,060\nYou didn't want them\nto mess with all that.\n\n640\n00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,970\nWell, you could enable the guest account,\nand\n\n641\n00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,990\nthen when they walk up to sit at that\ncomputer they could just click on guest\n\n642\n00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,180\nand then we get temporary\naccess to the system.\n\n643\n00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,480\nThey can log in, run the applications,\ndo whatever they wanted and\n\n644\n00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,090\nthen walk away when they were done.\n\n645\n00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,790\nRight.\n\n646\n00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,780\nSome people want that.\n\n647\n00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,140\nLike in a lab environment.\n\n648\n00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,270\nMost of us don't.\n\n649\n00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,720\nI do not want guest access on my laptop.\n\n650\n00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,680\nI don't want anonymous\npeople using my computer.\n\n651\n00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,700\nSo that's why it's disabled by default.\n\n652\n00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,320\nIf you want to enable it you'll\nneed to choose the account and\n\n653\n00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,760\nclick Allow guests to\nlog in to this computer.\n\n654\n00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,520\nAnd that's going to turn\non that functionality so\n\n655\n00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,160\nthey can come in and log in.\n\n656\n00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,680\nBy default,\nparental controls are turned on for\n\n657\n00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,330\nguests because Apple assumes you're\ngoing to be using this with children.\n\n658\n00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,780\nYou've got children you don't want\nto have to provide a password to.\n\n659\n00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,190\nThat's why you've got it.\n\n660\n00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,840\nBut you can turn that off,\nyou don't have to have it.\n\n661\n00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,180\nThe other thing is these guest accounts\nare not allowed to access your system via\n\n662\n00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,010\nthe network, by default, they have to\nbe physically sitting at your system.\n\n663\n00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,150\nAnd so you'll see that link right here,\n\n664\n00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:10,770\nallow guest users to connect to shared\nfolders, to allow them to be able\n\n665\n00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:14,625\nto reach across the network and\nto be able to share content themselves.\n\n666\n00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:19,470\nSo we can turn that functionality on and\nnow we've got guest access on the system.\n\n667\n00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:26,250\nThere's one more account that's created\nthat we don't see but it does exist.\n\n668\n00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:30,280\nThere's an account called root, r-o-o-t.\n\n669\n00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,800\nRoot is the Unix root user.\n\n670\n00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,330\nUnder the hood we're running\nBSD which is a Unix variant.\n\n671\n00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,770\nAnd that version of BSD that Apple's\ncreated still adheres to all the rules and\n\n672\n00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,880\nlaws of Unix.\n\n673\n00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,820\nAnd one of those rules is that you have to\nhave an administrative user called root.\n\n674\n00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,160\nIf you're a hacker,\nif you try to break into a system, and\n\n675\n00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,290\nyou know it's Unix based,\nlike if it's MacOS or Linux, or\n\n676\n00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,870\nwhatever, you know there's going\nto be an account called root.\n\n677\n00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,680\nSo you're going to target that one and\nApple knows that.\n\n678\n00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,440\nSo what Apple did they customized\nthe root account a bit.\n\n679\n00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,560\nThey made it where you cannot\nlog in as the root user.\n\n680\n00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,170\nSo if you want to login as the root user,\nright now, you can't.\n\n681\n00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,580\nIt won't do it.\n\n682\n00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,370\nThe root user, by default,\nhas no password.\n\n683\n00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,560\nNow you might say to yourself,\nthat's shocking,\n\n684\n00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,270\nwhy would you have this critical\naccount with no password?\n\n685\n00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,270\nWell the root account's\na little bit different.\n\n686\n00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,360\nIf the root account has no password,\nyou can't log in as it, all right.\n\n687\n00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,180\nYou can't do an interactive\nlog in with the root account.\n\n688\n00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,440\nSo you're not able to get in,\nand you're not able to run it.\n\n689\n00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,960\nWon't work over the network,\nand it won't work locally.\n\n690\n00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,240\nSo Apple hides it from the list,\nwe don't even see it.\n\n691\n00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,450\nBut it is there, all right.\n\n692\n00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,150\nIt's there, and you can't delete it.\n\n693\n00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,610\nIf you delete that root account.\n\n694\n00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,460\nIf you try and dig it out of the system.\n\n695\n00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,600\nThere's some services on the system\nthat will not function right.\n\n696\n00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,580\nThey depend on that user existing,\nthey want it to be there.\n\n697\n00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,830\nFor the most part it's hidden from us,\nwe just ignore it.\n\n698\n00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:55,020\nBut if you're ever digging around in\nthe UNIX file system inside of Mac OS,\n\n699\n00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,440\nyou may come across mention that root\nuser, it is there, it does exist.\n\n700\n00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:06,850\nAll right, David in the chatroom mentioned\nlike renaming the administrator account.\n\n701\n00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,110\nIn Windows that's pretty common when\nwe rename that administrator account.\n\n702\n00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,530\nIn Unix unfortunately you cant.\n\n703\n00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,170\nWe can't rename the root account,\nit's got to stay named Root.\n\n704\n00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,640\nBut it's disabled so\nwe don't worry about it so much.\n\n705\n00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,860\nDuring your initial install you\npick an administrator account.\n\n706\n00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,500\nYou can give it whatever name you want.\n\n707\n00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,445\nSo you kind of end up with\nthat level of security.\n\n708\n00:35:24,445 --> 00:35:26,895\nMicrosoft went a little bit of a different\nway because they weren't trying to be\n\n709\n00:35:26,895 --> 00:35:29,935\ncompatible with anybody else,\nso you do see variations there.\n\n710\n00:35:31,777 --> 00:35:35,105\nAll right, so those are some of the\nattributes that we might see as we start\n\n711\n00:35:35,105 --> 00:35:38,675\nto set up a user account, some of the\nspecial accounts that we have out there.\n\n712\n00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:42,055\nThe next thing I want to\ntalk about are home folders.\n\n713\n00:35:42,055 --> 00:35:46,670\nI showed you guys the home folders\nearlier when I went to the Finder,\n\n714\n00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:51,520\nI browse to my hard drive and\nI browsed into the user folder, all right?\n\n715\n00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,630\nEvery user account, accept for sharing\nonly account, will end up with a user\n\n716\n00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,590\nfolder, even the guest account has a user\nfolder, see that one up here, right there?\n\n717\n00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,950\nAnd when we browse into a user\nfolder we'll see those user's\n\n718\n00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,240\ndocuments all right.\n\n719\n00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,610\nSo if I browse into like\nDon Pezet all right,\n\n720\n00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,360\nI'm going to see some different folders.\n\n721\n00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,420\nI can see desktop right,\n\n722\n00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,850\nthat's what's being displayed\nback here on my desktop, right.\n\n723\n00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:17,970\nIf I were to create a file,\nlike if I browse into desktop and\n\n724\n00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,630\nI'll do a, I'll just do a new folder.\n\n725\n00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,240\nDon's Stuff.\n\n726\n00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,020\nRight.\nSo here's my Don's Stuff folder.\n\n727\n00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,600\nSee how as I created that folder\nhere it appeared on my desktop\n\n728\n00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,670\nin the background right?\n\n729\n00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,680\nThat's your desktop.\n\n730\n00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,020\nThat's where this stuff is saved and\nstored right here in your profile.\n\n731\n00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,400\nI've got Documents, right.\n\n732\n00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,450\nThat's where I'm supposed to put\nmy general, my generic documents.\n\n733\n00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:44,000\nAny data that I work with\nis supposed to go in there.\n\n734\n00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,420\nNow the intention of that folder was for\nmiscellaneous documents, right.\n\n735\n00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,660\nAnything like text files,\nword documents, spreadsheet stuff.\n\n736\n00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,280\nAnything like that would\ngo into documents.\n\n737\n00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,700\nBut there's some vendors that have written\napplications that store their stuff\n\n738\n00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,296\nthere too.\n\n739\n00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:04,270\nSo you may have things that are not what\nwe'd normally consider a document but\n\n740\n00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:04,830\nthey might be there.\n\n741\n00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,850\nAn example might be\na video game save game.\n\n742\n00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:12,010\nSo you're playing a video game and\nyou save your progress.\n\n743\n00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,740\nAnd it saves it into the documents folder.\n\n744\n00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,150\nIt's not a document in the traditional\nsense you wouldn't open it up in text edit\n\n745\n00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,590\nand look at it, right?\n\n746\n00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,470\nBut it's a document in\nthe sense of that video game\n\n747\n00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,580\nthat's where it saved your status.\n\n748\n00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:27,540\nYou may see other things inside\nof documents that go beyond just\n\n749\n00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,290\nWord documents and things of that nature.\n\n750\n00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,720\nWe've got Downloads.\n\n751\n00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,070\nIn Safari, when you download anything from\nthe internet, the default location for\n\n752\n00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,660\nit is the Downloads folder.\n\n753\n00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,420\nOther web browsers follow that too.\n\n754\n00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,460\nThey don't have to, but they choose to.\n\n755\n00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:44,500\nSo, if you install Chrome, it'll normally\ndownload to the Downloads folder also.\n\n756\n00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,300\nNow, the Downloads folder is one of few\nones that's actually linked down here\n\n757\n00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,540\nto your to your doc by default.\n\n758\n00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,960\nSo as I download stuff it'll\nshow up there in the doc.\n\n759\n00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,470\nLet me show you what I mean,\nlet me just fire up Safari, and\n\n760\n00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:02,180\nlet's see, what's something\nI can download real quick.\n\n761\n00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:07,260\nWell I can switch res x, apparently\nI'm not connected to the Internet,\n\n762\n00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,690\nso never mind on the whole download thing,\n\n763\n00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:12,410\nI have a hard time downloading if I'm\nnot actually connected to the Internet.\n\n764\n00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,140\nAll right, you know what?\n\n765\n00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,560\nHere I can get connected\nto the Internet real quick.\n\n766\n00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:22,960\nI'm just going to move my network adapter\nover and that should take care of that.\n\n767\n00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,830\nAnd if I'm just a little patient I should\nbe able to get out and we'll download.\n\n768\n00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,490\nAnd basically when we go out and\ndownload something it's going to\n\n769\n00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:34,010\nreach out there and\nit's going to Download that file.\n\n770\n00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:37,111\nIt'll go to the downloads folder,\nhere we go.\n\n771\n00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:40,670\nSo I'll just jump over to\nSwitchResX I'm going to download this.\n\n772\n00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:44,970\nThis is a utility I use all the time to\nlock in the resolution of your screen.\n\n773\n00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,230\nWhen you share a desktop\nlike I do all day,\n\n774\n00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,470\nit comes in handy to be\nable to lock resolutions.\n\n775\n00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,880\nSo if I come in here and\n\n776\n00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,590\ndownload it, I'm just going to click\non the, oh wait that's the PDF.\n\n777\n00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,840\nWell, you know what,\na PDF will work just fine.\n\n778\n00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,130\nI don't want to download all day here.\n\n779\n00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,530\nAll right.\nSo if I go to download something,\n\n780\n00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,350\nwhen I go to download it,\nsee how I've got a little flashing thing.\n\n781\n00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,040\nThat's my preview that's\nloading it up right there.\n\n782\n00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,230\nAnd my download icon,\nwhich is now kind of covered by my head,\n\n783\n00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:20,240\ncan we full screen that for a moment\nplace undue demands on our directory.\n\n784\n00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,940\nThere we go, see how my download icon\nchanged from a folder to this little\n\n785\n00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,250\nbook now, right?\n\n786\n00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,800\nThat's in my download folder now,\nthat's a file that I downloaded, and so\n\n787\n00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,090\nit's showing up right\nthere linked into my doc.\n\n788\n00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,890\nThe download folder is one of\nthe only ones that does that\n\n789\n00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,200\nthose kind of links in there.\n\n790\n00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,660\nHere I'll download another file,\nand when I download this one,\n\n791\n00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,560\nyou can see the little status\nbar there on the download link.\n\n792\n00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,520\nOr no, I guess you really can't.\n\n793\n00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,427\nIt's kind of off the bottom\nof the screen there.\n\n794\n00:39:43,427 --> 00:39:46,691\nBut it's downloading, and now all of\nmy downloads are displayed right there.\n\n795\n00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:48,752\nSo that one's kind of linked over there.\n\n796\n00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:55,520\nAll right, then we've got movies,\nmusic and pictures.\n\n797\n00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,330\nLike the name implies, that's where\nwe're supposed to store our video files,\n\n798\n00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:04,280\nour music, our audio files,\nand our pictures, our GIFs,\n\n799\n00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,030\nPNG, JPEG, whatever, photos,\nall that stuff goes right in there.\n\n800\n00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,850\nBy placing them in there, your other\napplications like garage band, iMovie,\n\n801\n00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,540\niPhoto, they all have access\nto your full library.\n\n802\n00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:19,140\nIf you put that stuff in other folders,\nthey may not find it, right?\n\n803\n00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,490\nWe have these folders to organize,\nand then there's public.\n\n804\n00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,040\nWhen you create a user profile like\nthis or when it's created for you,\n\n805\n00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,670\nit's locked to you, just to you, if I\nput something in music, only I see it.\n\n806\n00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:36,450\nBut what if I want one of the other\nusers on this computer to see it also?\n\n807\n00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,310\nRight?\nI want Nate\n\n808\n00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,890\nto be able to log into this computer and\nsee my music also.\n\n809\n00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,570\nWell if it's in my profile,\nhe won't see it.\n\n810\n00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:47,870\nBut if I put it in public\ninside a public he will see it.\n\n811\n00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,780\nRight?\n\n812\n00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,980\nAny other user of the computer,\ncan see your public folder.\n\n813\n00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,600\nNow that doesn't include network users.\n\n814\n00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,500\nAt least not by default.\n\n815\n00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,200\nYou can change that.\n\n816\n00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,000\nBut normally,\nit's the users local on your system.\n\n817\n00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,420\nIf you've got a computer you're\nsharing with your family, right?\n\n818\n00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,900\nMaybe it's like me,\nmy wife, and my two sons.\n\n819\n00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,120\nWell, I might have documents that I\nwant all of us to have access to.\n\n820\n00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,460\nI'd put those in public.\n\n821\n00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,340\nAnd then they'd all be able to see that.\n\n822\n00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,190\nAnd if I had documents that I wanted\nto see that I didn't want them to see,\n\n823\n00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,120\nI would put them back in my profile.\n\n824\n00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,860\nNow in the public folder, there's\none other folder created by default,\n\n825\n00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,510\ncalled Dropbox.\n\n826\n00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,480\nThis is a special public folder.\n\n827\n00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,810\nAll the other users will see this folder.\n\n828\n00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:30,820\nBut when they browse into it,\nit will always look empty.\n\n829\n00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,590\nIt'll look empty like\nthere's nothing in there.\n\n830\n00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,780\nAnd if they put files in there,\n\n831\n00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,490\nI'll be able to see it because it's\nmy Dropbox folder, but they won't.\n\n832\n00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:43,930\nThey have write permissions but\nnot read permissions.\n\n833\n00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,040\nLet me show you an example.\n\n834\n00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,090\nIf I go back to the users folder.\n\n835\n00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,120\nI see Christopher Walken right here.\n\n836\n00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,510\nAnd if I browse into Christopher Walken,\n\n837\n00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,730\nsee how all these folders\nhave red circles on them?\n\n838\n00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,360\nI'm a standard.\nHe's a standard user.\n\n839\n00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,180\nI don't have access to his folders.\n\n840\n00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,430\nI can't go into any of these,\nif I try and go into his desktop.\n\n841\n00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,140\nIt tells me I can't.\n\n842\n00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,300\nI don't have permissions.\n\n843\n00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,070\nRight?\n\n844\n00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,020\nBut I do have access to public.\n\n845\n00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,240\nAnd if I go into public,\nhere I see his public folder.\n\n846\n00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,830\nAnd maybe I wanna copy\nthat PDF over into public.\n\n847\n00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,360\nRight?\n\n848\n00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,220\nWell, CO is saying it requires\nan administrative password.\n\n849\n00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,780\nI don't have permission\nto write to his public.\n\n850\n00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,070\nI can see what's in his public.\n\n851\n00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,200\nBut I can't write to it.\n\n852\n00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,780\nI'm gonna cancel that, but\nif I go into Dropbox right,\n\n853\n00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:36,160\noh actually Dropbox is\nclosed off to me isn't it?\n\n854\n00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,940\nI assume that's because he\njust hasn't logged in yet.\n\n855\n00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,580\nWell that's interesting.\n\n856\n00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,870\nI should be able to log in there.\n\n857\n00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,890\nI haven't actually logged in\nas Christopher Walken yet so\n\n858\n00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,880\nthat must be stopping me, but\nnormally you'd go in there, and\n\n859\n00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,310\nyou can just take this PDF and\ndrop it in there, right.\n\n860\n00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,890\nYou'd have write permissions\nto be able to drop in there.\n\n861\n00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:56,710\nAnd once that's in there,\nit would look empty to me.\n\n862\n00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,860\nI wouldn't see it.\n\n863\n00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,690\nBut he would be able to see that file.\n\n864\n00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,570\nHe'd be able to get to it and\nwork with it.\n\n865\n00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:03,718\nIt's a way to give data to someone.\n\n866\n00:43:03,718 --> 00:43:06,590\nAll right.\n\n867\n00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:10,970\nNow, those are the main folders\nthat we see inside of somebody's\n\n868\n00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,540\nhome director, right?\n\n869\n00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,200\nThose are the ones that we need\nto be familiar with on the exam.\n\n870\n00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,330\nBut do know that in real life,\nthere's other ones that you don't see.\n\n871\n00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,780\nThere's several hidden folders.\n\n872\n00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,130\nLike there's one called preferences, and\n\n873\n00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,330\nthat's where your user\npreferences are stored.\n\n874\n00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,040\nLike when you set your wallpaper.\n\n875\n00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,780\nYour wallpaper's not\na system wide setting.\n\n876\n00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,720\nThat's set for just you.\n\n877\n00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,630\nAnd so it stores it in your\nown preferences folder.\n\n878\n00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,980\nBack on your hard drive,\nyou've got a preferences folder, too.\n\n879\n00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,850\nIt's tucked away under library,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n880\n00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,030\nOr no, actually, it's hidden, too.\n\n881\n00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,050\nIt's just straight under preferences.\n\n882\n00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:46,480\nAnd it's hidden because it\nis a system wide setting.\n\n883\n00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,190\nBut inside of your user account,\nyou've got one.\n\n884\n00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:49,860\nIt's just hidden.\n\n885\n00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,610\nIt's not showing here, all right?\n\n886\n00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:55,280\nIf I were to bring up my terminal,\nwhich is kind of microscopic, but\n\n887\n00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,710\nI if I were to do a full list, I could see\nI've got Desktop, Documents, Download,\n\n888\n00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,590\nLibrary, so on, and\nthen some of these other files.\n\n889\n00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:07,610\nNow my account's new, as I create more and\nmore things, this directory\n\n890\n00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:11,540\nis gonna get bigger and bigger, and bigger\nwith more stuff showing up inside of it.\n\n891\n00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,758\nAnd let me do this with\nelevated privileges real quick.\n\n892\n00:44:15,758 --> 00:44:18,433\nAnd, oh, shoot.\n\n893\n00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:27,400\n[LAUGH] All right, well, it's not\ngonna let me do it as a regular user.\n\n894\n00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,470\nLet me switch over to\nan administrator real quick.\n\n895\n00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,720\nI'm gonna just log out.\n\n896\n00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,240\nThere's some folders that\ndon't show up by default.\n\n897\n00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,350\nThese are the main ones, right?\n\n898\n00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:37,440\nEverybody's gonna have these,\nand as a standard user,\n\n899\n00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,140\nthese are the ones you need to work with.\n\n900\n00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,570\nBut there's others.\n\n901\n00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,570\nLike the preferences folder,\nthat don't show up.\n\n902\n00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:44,870\nEvery user has preferences, right?\n\n903\n00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,660\nLike my wallpaper in the background.\n\n904\n00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,500\nThe wallpaper, that's not a system\nwide setting, it's set for just me.\n\n905\n00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,700\nIt doesn't store it in\nthe system's preferences folder,\n\n906\n00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,640\nit stores it in one that's in my\nprofile itself and it's in here.\n\n907\n00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,470\nI just don't see it, right?\n\n908\n00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,910\nIt's hidden from me, right?\n\n909\n00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,228\nAnd that's how some of\nthese special folders are.\n\n910\n00:45:02,228 --> 00:45:05,170\nIf we wanna take a look at all\nthe ones that are available,\n\n911\n00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,960\nwell, they don't really give you\na great way to do it, but from the GUI.\n\n912\n00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,440\nThere's various preference alterations\nyou can make to make it show up, but\n\n913\n00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440\nApple doesn't really want you to do those,\nbut\n\n914\n00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,160\nI can show you them right\nhere from a terminal window.\n\n915\n00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:21,000\nIf I go into the users folder,\nand don pezet\n\n916\n00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:26,750\nwhen I pull up a directory listing I see\nDesktop, Documents, Downloads, Movies,\n\n917\n00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:31,600\nMusic, Pictures, public, just like we saw\na moment ago, and I also see library.\n\n918\n00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,490\nAll right, well when I looked over here\njust a moment ago, I don't see library.\n\n919\n00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:40,610\nThat's an example of a folder that's\nhidden from me, but it is there.\n\n920\n00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,620\nIt is an actual folder, and\n\n921\n00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,930\nif I go into library, wow,\nI'm getting, permission denied.\n\n922\n00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,478\nOh, let me fire up another tab.\n\n923\n00:45:49,478 --> 00:45:52,130\nAnd we'll go in this way.\n\n924\n00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,380\nThere we go.\n\n925\n00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,860\nIf I go into my library, I'll see\nthere's all sorts of stuff in there.\n\n926\n00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,100\nAnd these are things like my Preferences.\n\n927\n00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,360\nRight there,\nthat's where my Preferences are stored.\n\n928\n00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,230\nThis library is full of settings, that the\naverage user doesn't need to mess with and\n\n929\n00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,190\nyou can actually break things\nif you do mess with it, right.\n\n930\n00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:11,210\nThey hide that away and\nstop you from getting into it right.\n\n931\n00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,440\nYour printers are right there,\nSafari's configuration is there,\n\n932\n00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,010\nyour screen savers,\ninput methods, calendars.\n\n933\n00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:21,680\nAll the various things that make\nyour user experience what it is,\n\n934\n00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,880\nis right here inside of this library.\n\n935\n00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:29,270\nNow there's other folders that\ndon't show up by default and\n\n936\n00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:33,690\ndon't exist by default, but\ncan be created in R special.\n\n937\n00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,640\nIt's kind of confusing,\nlet me give you a better example.\n\n938\n00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,340\nEarlier I mentioned that a regular user\ndoesn't have permission to write to\n\n939\n00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,980\nthe applications folder.\n\n940\n00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,880\nAs the application photo.\n\n941\n00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,180\nWhen you install an application\nthat is where it goes and\n\n942\n00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,770\na regular user doesn't have\npermission to write that.\n\n943\n00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:48,540\nIf they want to install and\n\n944\n00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,220\napplication they can do it\nthrough the app store, or not.\n\n945\n00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,420\nThat's it they either use the app store,\n\n946\n00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,650\nthat's the only way they can\nuse install an application.\n\n947\n00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:59,230\nBut what if I wanna a user to\nbe able to run a program, but\n\n948\n00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:02,170\nnot have permission to install\ninto the applications folder.\n\n949\n00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,880\nI don't wanna make him an administrator.\n\n950\n00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,920\nWell, you can actually create\nan applications folder in\n\n951\n00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,450\nthat user's profile.\n\n952\n00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:12,530\nAnd then make it have applications\nthat are just for them.\n\n953\n00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,860\nAnd it's a special folder, right?\n\n954\n00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,480\nIt's not like a normal folder.\n\n955\n00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,150\nIf I go back to my finder.\n\n956\n00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:21,650\nHere in my profile, if I create a new\nfolder, and I call it Applications.\n\n957\n00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:23,510\nAll right.\n\n958\n00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,460\nNotice how the icon changed, right?\n\n959\n00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,450\nIf I create a folder, and\nI just call it something like,\n\n960\n00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:33,450\nDon's super folder here's Don's\nsuper folder, that's super right?\n\n961\n00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:37,734\nWell it just gets a blue folder icon,\nit's a normal run of the mill folder,\n\n962\n00:47:37,734 --> 00:47:41,818\nbut when I created applications Mac OS\nknew oh this is a special folder.\n\n963\n00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:45,878\nThis is so the user can run applications\njust for them, and they have permissions\n\n964\n00:47:45,878 --> 00:47:49,828\nto that folder, they can download\napplications, stick them in that folder.\n\n965\n00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:53,351\nAnd then they'll show up in their doc,\nif they wanna add them there, or\n\n966\n00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:56,700\nin their spotlight if they're\nsearching for applications.\n\n967\n00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,280\nThey'll find it in that list.\n\n968\n00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,920\nSo, that's a way for\n\n969\n00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,805\nthem to do that without having permission\nto modify the whole system, all right?\n\n970\n00:48:03,805 --> 00:48:08,990\nS, these special folders are kind of\nimportant in certain use case scenarios,\n\n971\n00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:11,500\nbut most users aren't going to need those.\n\n972\n00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,920\nAll right, so those are the files and\nfolders that make up a user profile.\n\n973\n00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,820\nThose are some of the ones that are hidden\nthat we can make available, right?\n\n974\n00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:24,720\nIt's pretty neat stuff, and that's all\na part of that individual user account.\n\n975\n00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,890\nAll right, well we spent the whole\nbeginning of this episode talking about\n\n976\n00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:31,760\ncreating user accounts, and then we\njust went over their attributes and\n\n977\n00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,750\ntheir folders.\n\n978\n00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,280\nThe next thing I wanna talk about,\n\n979\n00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,960\nis getting rid of a user account\nwhen you're done with it.\n\n980\n00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,490\nAnd so that's what we're gonna\ntackle in the next segment.\n\n981\n00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:43,286\nBut for right now, let's stop and\ntake a break, and we'll be back in a few.\n\n982\n00:48:43,286 --> 00:48:50,953\n[SOUND].\n\n983\n00:48:50,953 --> 00:48:52,661\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n984\n00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:55,796\nSo in the first couple of segments we\nlooked at creating user accounts, and\n\n985\n00:48:55,796 --> 00:48:57,258\nwhat they look like on the system.\n\n986\n00:48:57,258 --> 00:48:59,786\nNow, I wanna address\ndeleting user accounts.\n\n987\n00:48:59,786 --> 00:49:00,861\nAnd I know what you're thinking,\n\n988\n00:49:00,861 --> 00:49:02,690\nyou're like Don are you really\ngonna do a segment on this?\n\n989\n00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,350\nYou just highlight a user and\nyou hit the Delete button and that's it.\n\n990\n00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,160\nThere is actually a little bit more to it\nthat you need to be aware of for the exam.\n\n991\n00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:13,980\nEspecially when it comes to restoring\na user account that you my have deleted.\n\n992\n00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,780\nThere is a little process for that.\n\n993\n00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,010\nSo I wanna show you guys that and\nkind of what's involved, all right?\n\n994\n00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,136\nWell, I've created a few\nuser accounts in this show,\n\n995\n00:49:21,136 --> 00:49:22,578\none of them was Christopher Walken.\n\n996\n00:49:22,578 --> 00:49:26,105\nAnd I don't actually know Christopher\nWalken, he never swings by the office, so\n\n997\n00:49:26,105 --> 00:49:28,162\nI might as well go ahead and\ndelete his account.\n\n998\n00:49:28,162 --> 00:49:30,230\nSo I'm gonna go in and knock that out.\n\n999\n00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:34,310\nI'll just go into my System Preferences,\nand I'll go to Users and Groups.\n\n1000\n00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,340\nAnd I'll unlock the screen,\nbecause it's an administrative task.\n\n1001\n00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,090\nAnd I'll find old\nChristopher Walken right there.\n\n1002\n00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,030\nWell, to delete a user account,\n\n1003\n00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:49,480\nall we have to do is hit the little\nMinus button right there.\n\n1004\n00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,850\nWe hit the Minus button, that's gonna\ndelete that account out of there.\n\n1005\n00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:55,940\nYou'll see you've the got the Plus\nbutton to add, Minus to delete, and\n\n1006\n00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,220\nthen the little gear for\nyour master password settings.\n\n1007\n00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:02,210\nWe'll talk about those later when we talk\nabout FileVault, and all that good stuff.\n\n1008\n00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,452\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\ntake Christopher Walken here,\n\n1009\n00:50:04,452 --> 00:50:06,204\nand just hit that Minus\nbutton to delete him.\n\n1010\n00:50:06,204 --> 00:50:10,328\nNow, when you delete him,\nyou're presented with three choices.\n\n1011\n00:50:10,328 --> 00:50:13,165\nThe first choice is,\nwhen we delete the user account,\n\n1012\n00:50:13,165 --> 00:50:15,660\nwhat do we do with the home directory?\n\n1013\n00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,570\nThe first choice says let's\ntake that home directory and\n\n1014\n00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:22,100\nconvert it to an image file, a DMG.\n\n1015\n00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:27,120\nWe'll turn it into a disk image, and we'll\nstore that in a Deleted Users folder.\n\n1016\n00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,370\nThe nice part about this is,\nis just because I deleted the user,\n\n1017\n00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:34,550\ndoesn't necessarily mean I wanted to lose\nall their documents and other files.\n\n1018\n00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:38,510\nSo it packages them all up into a nice\nlittle file that's easy to backup or\n\n1019\n00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:41,250\ncopy somewhere else, and\nit sets it on your hard drive.\n\n1020\n00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:44,720\nSo the user is gone, but\nyou've got all their data backed up.\n\n1021\n00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,390\nThat's the default option\nwhen you delete a user.\n\n1022\n00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:52,930\nSo their home directory is removed,\nbut the contents of it are protected.\n\n1023\n00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:53,940\nAll right, they're retained.\n\n1024\n00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:59,290\nThe second option says,\ndelete the user account, but\n\n1025\n00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:02,310\nleave their home directory right\nwhere it is, don't take it away.\n\n1026\n00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:07,250\nSo now, if I browse into that user's\nfolder, that directory will still exist.\n\n1027\n00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:10,209\nIt'll still be there, and\nthe user's contents are left unchanged.\n\n1028\n00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:15,790\nThe third option, though, says,\ndelete the home directory, get rid of it.\n\n1029\n00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:19,300\nWe're gonna wipe out that home directory\nso that it won't be recoverable.\n\n1030\n00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,690\nNow this one is the only option\nthat actually has a sub-option.\n\n1031\n00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,750\nIt has this Erase Home Folder Securely.\n\n1032\n00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,300\nWhat the heck is that all about?\n\n1033\n00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,910\nWell, if you do the normal deletion,\n\n1034\n00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:33,320\nall it does is it goes into the HFS table\nand it removes the pointers to the files.\n\n1035\n00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,730\nSo it basically flags\nthe files as deleted, but\n\n1036\n00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:38,810\nthe files technically still\nexist on the hard drive.\n\n1037\n00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:41,490\nSo if you were to fire up\na utility like Disc Warrior,\n\n1038\n00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:45,450\nyou can scan the hard drive and\nrecover those files, they're still there.\n\n1039\n00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:50,950\nBut if you choose Erase the Home Folder\nSecurely, what it does is it writes dummy\n\n1040\n00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:55,380\ndata to the sectors where that data was\nstored, and then erases the dummy data.\n\n1041\n00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,580\nSo if somebody tries to recover the files,\nthey'll be recovering dummy data,\n\n1042\n00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,942\nnot the actual files.\n\n1043\n00:52:00,942 --> 00:52:04,490\nIt makes hard drive scanning utilities,\nforensics utilities, things like that,\n\n1044\n00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:06,630\nwhere they're unable to recover that data.\n\n1045\n00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:10,640\nSo in a high security environment, in\nan environment maybe you're deleting your\n\n1046\n00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,320\nuser account cuz you're about\nto sell your laptop on eBay.\n\n1047\n00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,560\nWell, you can do this Erase Home Folders\nSecurely, and that'll wipe that out and\n\n1048\n00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,850\nensure that your data is not\nrecoverable by third party utilities.\n\n1049\n00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:25,710\nNow there's other utilities out there\nthat do a better job of scrubbing it, but\n\n1050\n00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,530\nthis built-in one is good enough for\nmost users.\n\n1051\n00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:31,782\nAll right,\nwell let's see a few of these in action.\n\n1052\n00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:35,124\nI'm gonna take Christopher Walken, and\nI'm gonna do the normal remove for him.\n\n1053\n00:52:35,124 --> 00:52:39,190\nI'm gonna say save the home folder in\na disk image and I'll delete the user.\n\n1054\n00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,050\nSo that's gonna wipe him out.\n\n1055\n00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,480\nNotice it's not an immediate thing.\n\n1056\n00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,162\nIt says deleting an account cuz it's\nbuilding that image file right now.\n\n1057\n00:52:47,162 --> 00:52:49,010\nNext I'll take Jason Phillips here.\n\n1058\n00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,296\nWell no, he's sharing-only, so\nhe doesn't have a home folder,\n\n1059\n00:52:51,296 --> 00:52:52,270\nthat's not a good example.\n\n1060\n00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:55,078\nI'll take Nathan Copeland,\nand I'm gonna delete him.\n\n1061\n00:52:55,078 --> 00:52:59,280\nAnd for him I'm gonna say,\ndon't change the home folder, leave it be.\n\n1062\n00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,911\nRemove Nathan but leave the folder.\n\n1063\n00:53:01,911 --> 00:53:04,660\nAll right, so we'll get rid of that one.\n\n1064\n00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:09,411\nAnd then we'll take, well maybe me, we'll\ntake my account, and I'll delete mine.\n\n1065\n00:53:09,411 --> 00:53:15,465\nAnd for me, I'm gonna say delete the home\nfolder and erase the home folder securely.\n\n1066\n00:53:15,465 --> 00:53:19,420\nLike actually get rid of it,\nit's gone, and that's the end of it.\n\n1067\n00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,400\nSo I'll go ahead and delete,\nit and there it goes.\n\n1068\n00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,520\nNow this one can take a little while too\nbecause it has to do that drive scrub, and\n\n1069\n00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,000\nthat happens in the background.\n\n1070\n00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,260\nIt looks like mine went\npretty quick though,\n\n1071\n00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,500\ncuz the folder was basically empty.\n\n1072\n00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,940\nAll right, so\nnow those user accounts are gone.\n\n1073\n00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,260\nI guess I can get rid of Jason too.\n\n1074\n00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,170\nJason's just a sharing-only user,\nso he doesn't have a home folder.\n\n1075\n00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:39,640\nBut I'll knock that one out,\nnice and clean.\n\n1076\n00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,230\nSo now,\nI'm down to just my help desk account.\n\n1077\n00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:46,640\nWell, if I browse to that user's folder,\nlet's see what we've got in there now.\n\n1078\n00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,200\nSo if I browse to my hard drive,\nand I browse into Users,\n\n1079\n00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,680\nI'll see that Nate,\nhis folder was left alone.\n\n1080\n00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,830\nWell, not entirely.\n\n1081\n00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:58,470\nLook what it did,\nit left Nate's folder, but\n\n1082\n00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:01,880\nit added Deleted in\nparentheses at the end.\n\n1083\n00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,460\nAnd that way I know, that's his old\nfolder and the account has been deleted.\n\n1084\n00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,210\nThe account's deleted, but\nthe folder's still there.\n\n1085\n00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:11,700\nI can browse into it, and\nthere's the stuff, right?\n\n1086\n00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,830\nNow I've got the red circles cuz\nI don't have permission, right?\n\n1087\n00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:18,270\nAs an administrator I might need to\noverride those permissions to be able to\n\n1088\n00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:20,420\nget in and access that data, and\n\n1089\n00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,940\nwe'll talk about file\npermissions in another episode.\n\n1090\n00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,770\nBut otherwise his data is still there,\nit can be recovered.\n\n1091\n00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:31,190\nBut I removed Christopher Walken and\nhis data's nowhere to be seen.\n\n1092\n00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:34,300\nWell it is there,\nhere's the Deleted Users folder.\n\n1093\n00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:38,923\nThat wasn't there before, so that was\ncreated when I removed him because I said,\n\n1094\n00:54:38,923 --> 00:54:40,536\nsave his folder as ns image.\n\n1095\n00:54:40,536 --> 00:54:45,200\nAnd if I go into Deleted Users,\nthere's ChristopherWalken.dmg.\n\n1096\n00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,580\nHis entire home directory was wrapped up\nin this disk image and stored right here.\n\n1097\n00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,846\nAnd I can take that and I can copy it\nto another computer, I can back it up,\n\n1098\n00:54:52,846 --> 00:54:54,412\nor I can just leave it right there.\n\n1099\n00:54:54,412 --> 00:54:57,843\nAnd then one day five months from now I go\nman, Chris was working on that project and\n\n1100\n00:54:57,843 --> 00:54:59,500\nI really need access to that document.\n\n1101\n00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,453\nWhere is it?\n\n1102\n00:55:00,453 --> 00:55:02,990\nOh, let me go access his home directory.\n\n1103\n00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:07,250\nAnd we can mount this image,\nthere we go, and\n\n1104\n00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,830\nonce it's mounted you can browse\ninto it and here's his directory.\n\n1105\n00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:13,190\nAnd notice, file permissions are not\na problem here in the disk image.\n\n1106\n00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:17,214\nThe disk image basically strips out the\nfile permissions, and you could get in and\n\n1107\n00:55:17,214 --> 00:55:20,495\naccess his resources and\nwhatever was in there, access the data.\n\n1108\n00:55:20,495 --> 00:55:25,520\nAnd when you're done,\nyou just close this and unmount the image.\n\n1109\n00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,130\nBut now we've got this nice little\ncopy of his account that we can\n\n1110\n00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,390\nalways jump back to if we need to.\n\n1111\n00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,920\nMeanwhile, the Don Pezet account,\nif I go back to the hard drive and\n\n1112\n00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,300\nI go to Users, no Don Pezet.\n\n1113\n00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,910\nNot deleted, not in Deleted Users,\nit's completely gone.\n\n1114\n00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:43,550\nSo on that one I chose to delete it and\nnot save it.\n\n1115\n00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,680\nIt's gone and\nthat's the end of it, all right?\n\n1116\n00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,699\nSo those are the three different\ntypes of deletions that we can do.\n\n1117\n00:55:49,699 --> 00:55:54,008\nNow, what if we delete a user, so\nI delete Christopher Walken, and\n\n1118\n00:55:54,008 --> 00:55:56,969\nthen he just happens to\nwatch the show one day.\n\n1119\n00:55:56,969 --> 00:55:58,619\nAnd he calls in and says,\nhey Don, I love the show.\n\n1120\n00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:00,379\nI'm gonna come by the office one day.\n\n1121\n00:56:00,379 --> 00:56:01,225\nAwesome.\n\n1122\n00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:02,407\nBut, now I'm thinking, crap.\n\n1123\n00:56:02,407 --> 00:56:03,313\nI deleted his account.\n\n1124\n00:56:03,313 --> 00:56:04,980\nI need to get it back.\n\n1125\n00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,240\nWell, there's not a great way,\nto restore a user.\n\n1126\n00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,500\nI can't just go and\nhit Restore a deleted user.\n\n1127\n00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,070\nIt doesn't do that.\n\n1128\n00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:16,700\nSo, restoring a deleted\nuser is a two-step process.\n\n1129\n00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,840\nStep number one,\nyou need to put the home folder back.\n\n1130\n00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,680\nPut the folder back.\n\n1131\n00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,730\nYou don't have to worry about permissions.\n\n1132\n00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:24,470\nMac O/S is going to take care of that for\nus.\n\n1133\n00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:26,570\nBut you just need to put\nthe home folder back.\n\n1134\n00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:30,560\nIn the case of Nate, that means that\nbasically I need to like remove that\n\n1135\n00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,210\ndeleted Mac from the end\nof it right there, right?\n\n1136\n00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:35,180\nSo, it shows it's deleted.\n\n1137\n00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:38,970\nI would need to remove that from the end,\nwhich I don't think it's gonna let me do\n\n1138\n00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:44,300\nbecause I added the override permissions,\nso I'm not gonna do it right now.\n\n1139\n00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,110\nBut for Christopher Watkin,\nit's completely gone.\n\n1140\n00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:47,900\nI need to restore it from that disc image.\n\n1141\n00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,040\nWell, I've got it, right?\n\n1142\n00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,740\nI can go in here and mount that image.\n\n1143\n00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,820\nAnd I can go back to my user's folder,\nand I'm gonna create a new folder.\n\n1144\n00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,240\nAnd I'm gonna call it Christopher Walken.\n\n1145\n00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,670\nI'm going to try, and create a new\nfolder called Christopher Walken.\n\n1146\n00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:08,550\nAnd apparently it's gonna think the users\nfolder is a protected folder, so\n\n1147\n00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,410\nit should prompt me for my credentials.\n\n1148\n00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,860\nI might just be being impatient here.\n\n1149\n00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,680\nBut, it should prompt me for\nthe credentials and\n\n1150\n00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,230\nthen allow me to create that.\n\n1151\n00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:19,910\nIf it doesn't, another option is that\nwe can do it through the terminal.\n\n1152\n00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:23,050\nThat might be a little faster for\nme, did it.\n\n1153\n00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:26,080\nI thought it might have just prompted but\nit didn't, all right?\n\n1154\n00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,440\nWell, I'll do it through the terminal.\n\n1155\n00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,610\nSo, here in the terminal I can\nchange into the users folder, and\n\n1156\n00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:34,210\nI'll do this the hard way\nwith the SUDO command, and\n\n1157\n00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:37,940\nI'll make a directory called,\nchristopherwalken.\n\n1158\n00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:43,530\nAnd it's administrative, so\nhere it's prompting me for a password.\n\n1159\n00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:44,650\nThe GUI should prompted me.\n\n1160\n00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:45,665\nI'm just being impatient.\n\n1161\n00:57:45,665 --> 00:57:48,180\n[COUGH] And creating it this way so\nthat I had it.\n\n1162\n00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:52,490\nBut basically, I've recreated that\nChristopher Walken folder, and\n\n1163\n00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:55,470\nnow I can take his contents and\nthrow him back in here.\n\n1164\n00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:58,630\nNow, there's a little bit\nof a problem in that.\n\n1165\n00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:00,039\nWell there's my authentication prompt.\n\n1166\n00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:06,680\nThere we go, there's a little bit of a\nproblem in that I now own all these files.\n\n1167\n00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:11,070\nThese folders show as being mine and\nnot his, okay?\n\n1168\n00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,960\nSo, that's gonna have to get fixed.\n\n1169\n00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,200\nAnd fortunately the GUIs\ngonna fix that for me.\n\n1170\n00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,250\nSo [LAUGH]\nnow, it says I got in a hurry,\n\n1171\n00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,442\nit's prompting me for\ncredential several times so there we go.\n\n1172\n00:58:21,442 --> 00:58:25,250\nAll right, so I got my folder and\nI just copied his contents back into it.\n\n1173\n00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,810\nI'm the owner but that will all\nget sorted out here in a minute.\n\n1174\n00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:33,088\nSo step one, restore the user's data,\nput their home folder back.\n\n1175\n00:58:33,088 --> 00:58:39,850\nStep two Re-create the user\nwith the same name.\n\n1176\n00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,710\nNow, when you re-create a user.\n\n1177\n00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:47,420\nIt might have the same name, but Unixs is\nsmart enough to know that it's different.\n\n1178\n00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,230\nThat it's not the same account.\n\n1179\n00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:52,840\nYou user account, actually has a numerical\nID account attached to it too.\n\n1180\n00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,530\nSo, when I created Christopher Walken\nhe might have been user ID 5.\n\n1181\n00:58:56,530 --> 00:59:00,110\nBut I deleted him, and now when I\ncreate a new Christopher Walken,\n\n1182\n00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:03,340\nhe might be user ID 12, right,\nso the user ID will change.\n\n1183\n00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,290\nWe don't see that in the GUI though, so\nwe're not too terribly worried about it.\n\n1184\n00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:11,380\nBut it does change, so\nwhen I go to create this account.\n\n1185\n00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,840\nThe way that I let it know that it's the\nsame as the old one is by making sure that\n\n1186\n00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,700\naccount name, the Unix name matches.\n\n1187\n00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,240\nAnd so, I'm gonna have to match\nthat up here, in just a moment.\n\n1188\n00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:23,280\nI would do it here,\nexcept my authentication prompts,\n\n1189\n00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,430\nare taking an incredibly\nlong time to appear.\n\n1190\n00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:28,340\nI'm not sure what's going on with that.\n\n1191\n00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,810\nWell, let me wait for that.\n\n1192\n00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:31,520\nWhile we're waiting on it,\n\n1193\n00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,140\nlet me just mention what happens\nif we do this out of order, right?\n\n1194\n00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:38,300\nIt's real important that you restore\nthe user's home directory first, right?\n\n1195\n00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,400\nRestore their home directory first.\n\n1196\n00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,050\nThen, after their home\ndirectory is created,\n\n1197\n00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,190\nrecreate their account with the same name,\nright?\n\n1198\n00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:49,290\nIf you do it the other way around,\nif you create the user account first,\n\n1199\n00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,570\nit's gonna create a blank home directory.\n\n1200\n00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:54,510\nAnd then when you go to\nrestore the user's data.\n\n1201\n00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:58,070\nThe user's data, all of it's gonna\nhave permissions for your account.\n\n1202\n00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,190\nAnd the user won't be able to access it.\n\n1203\n00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:00,860\nYou break the profile.\n\n1204\n01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,340\nIf we restore the home directory first,\n\n1205\n01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:06,230\nwhen we create the account it'll\nsee the folder already exists.\n\n1206\n01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:07,210\nAnd we'll get a little message.\n\n1207\n01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:08,220\nIt'll say, warning.\n\n1208\n01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,100\nThe folder already exists.\n\n1209\n01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,250\nShould we use it?\n\n1210\n01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,450\nAnd you can hit the Button,\nand it'll fix the permissions.\n\n1211\n01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:17,260\nIt'll reassign the permissions\nto apply to the user account.\n\n1212\n01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,160\nThere we go,\nI just got my authentication prompt.\n\n1213\n01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,850\nChris just mentioned, in the chat room,\n\n1214\n01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,750\nthat I could do this\nfrom the command prompt.\n\n1215\n01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:27,300\nAnd James [LAUGH] I could.\n\n1216\n01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:32,170\nI could jump out of the terminal and\ndo, CH, the change mode command, and\n\n1217\n01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,460\ngo in there and modify the permissions,\nand get those set up.\n\n1218\n01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,690\nBut the GUI is supposed to\nbe a lot more responsive.\n\n1219\n01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:39,918\nI'm not quite sure why my authentication\nprompts are taking so long?\n\n1220\n01:00:39,918 --> 01:00:44,210\nBut, I'm gonna go in here and I'll just\ncome in and log in as help desk, so\n\n1221\n01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,220\nI can make user modification.\n\n1222\n01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:51,560\nI'll create a new user, and the user\nis going to be Christopher Walken.\n\n1223\n01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:56,160\nAnd the account name,\nnow that account name has to be the same.\n\n1224\n01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,690\nBecause, remember the home\nfolder is gonna use that for\n\n1225\n01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:01,130\na folder name and so\nI'm calling it Christopher Walken.\n\n1226\n01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:04,472\nAnd if I want to double check,\njust before the moment of truth,\n\n1227\n01:01:04,472 --> 01:01:07,070\nI'm gonna double check\nwhen I go into users, and\n\n1228\n01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:12,750\nmake sure that that folder is called\nChristopher Walken, there it is, right?\n\n1229\n01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:16,890\nSo that's that folder that I made it,\nit is spelled right and I'm gonna go ahead\n\n1230\n01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:19,880\nand say use a separate password and\npunch in a password for the user.\n\n1231\n01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:23,270\nAnd now hit create user.\n\n1232\n01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:28,640\nNow when that happens, it will see\nthe home folder already exists, and\n\n1233\n01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,160\nif the permissions don't match,\nthen it will prompt me to fix it.\n\n1234\n01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,490\nNow, I may have logged out here, I did.\n\n1235\n01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:36,620\nShoot, I logged out, all right?\n\n1236\n01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:37,900\nSometimes you log out.\n\n1237\n01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:42,540\nSometimes, if you haven't created anymore\nuser accounts since the last time,\n\n1238\n01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,860\nwhen you create the user\naccount the IDs will match.\n\n1239\n01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,900\nAnd the permissions don't\nhave to be changed.\n\n1240\n01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,260\nAnd apparently that's what's happening for\nme.\n\n1241\n01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:49,710\nThe permissions match and it's fine.\n\n1242\n01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:56,140\nBut, if the IDs don't match,\nthe permissions have to be reset.\n\n1243\n01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:59,110\nAnd if the permissions have to be reset,\nit will prompt you, and\n\n1244\n01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:00,210\nit will say fix permissions.\n\n1245\n01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:02,550\nAnd you just click the button and\nit fixes them, right?\n\n1246\n01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:04,570\nThat's what I was expecting me to see,\nI thought I'd get it.\n\n1247\n01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,430\nBut, I lucked out in the ID match.\n\n1248\n01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:08,700\nSo now, it knows to use that.\n\n1249\n01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,500\nIt didn't create another\nChristopher Walken.\n\n1250\n01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:12,830\nIt's using this one.\n\n1251\n01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:17,500\nAnd if he logs back in,\nhe'll have his documents, his preferences,\n\n1252\n01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,250\nhis wallpaper, all aesthetics.\n\n1253\n01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:22,520\nTo him, it'll look like the user\naccount is just like it was before.\n\n1254\n01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,370\nTo us, we know yeah the ID\nmight be different now,\n\n1255\n01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,730\nbut everything else is the same.\n\n1256\n01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:29,620\nSo that's how you restore a user account.\n\n1257\n01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,010\nKey thing to remember on the exam.\n\n1258\n01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:34,800\nIf you have like a drag and drop question\nfor ordering this, you absolutely need to\n\n1259\n01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:40,130\nrestore the user folder first, and\nthen create the user account second.\n\n1260\n01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:43,380\nBe aware that the user ID might not match,\nso you'll get a prompt, and\n\n1261\n01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,820\nyou just hit To Fix the permissions and\nit knocks it out.\n\n1262\n01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:48,330\nReal easy,\nnow the user's able to get back in.\n\n1263\n01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:51,060\nThe only setting that we can't\nreally restore is the password.\n\n1264\n01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,810\nI don't know what his password used to be.\n\n1265\n01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:56,030\nAnd when I created that user account,\nI had to pick a new one.\n\n1266\n01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:59,720\nSo, we will have to tell the user,\nby the way, your user user account.\n\n1267\n01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,450\nOr your password has been reset.\n\n1268\n01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:03,790\nBut they should expect that.\n\n1269\n01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:05,730\nTheir account was deleted anyway.\n\n1270\n01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:09,240\nSo, this is just part of that process.\n\n1271\n01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,160\nBut at this point,\nI now have that account back.\n\n1272\n01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,330\nHe's in place.\n\n1273\n01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:15,160\nAnd this profile is put back\nto the way that it was.\n\n1274\n01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,039\nAnd we're back in business.\n\n1275\n01:03:17,472 --> 01:03:20,700\nAll right, so as far as deleting,\nrestoring a User, that's basically it.\n\n1276\n01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:24,090\nThere is another option which is we could\nuse Time Machine to roll our computer back\n\n1277\n01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,300\nto a previous date.\n\n1278\n01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,510\nBut then, we lose a lot of other\ninformation that changed since that date.\n\n1279\n01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:32,310\nDoing it this way, it's just that one\nUser account that we're recovering and\n\n1280\n01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:33,450\nthat's a little bit better.\n\n1281\n01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,520\nI guess I could have brought his\n\n1282\n01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,630\nUser Profile back from\na Time Machine backup too.\n\n1283\n01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,230\nThat would have been another option\nas opposed to using the disk image\n\n1284\n01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:40,150\nlike I did.\n\n1285\n01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,500\nBut that's basically it.\n\n1286\n01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:47,070\nAll right, so in this show we've seen\nquite a bit about user accounts.\n\n1287\n01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:50,590\nWe saw creating user accounts and\nthe five types of account, all right?\n\n1288\n01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:53,030\nRemember, administrator, standard user,\n\n1289\n01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:57,370\nmanage with parental controls,\nguest, group, right?\n\n1290\n01:03:57,370 --> 01:04:00,140\nThose are the five account\ntypes that we saw, I'm sorry.\n\n1291\n01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:01,490\nShared only, not guest.\n\n1292\n01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:03,600\nShared only and groups.\n\n1293\n01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,400\nThose are the five original\ntypes that we covered.\n\n1294\n01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,350\nThen we saw the attributes,\nfor the user accounts.\n\n1295\n01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:13,300\nTheir account name,\ntheir display name, their password.\n\n1296\n01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,560\nAnd lastly we saw how to delete and\nrestore those?\n\n1297\n01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,270\nThe other thing that we covered was,\n\n1298\n01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,710\nthe folders inside of\na typical home directory.\n\n1299\n01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:22,110\nIt's important that you\nknow what each of those do.\n\n1300\n01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:24,004\nThey're pretty self explanatory though.\n\n1301\n01:04:24,004 --> 01:04:26,630\nSo, be aware of those\nall testable material.\n\n1302\n01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:31,400\nThat's not the end of us for user,\nwell I guess, it sort of is the end for\n\n1303\n01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,290\nuser accounts.\n\n1304\n01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:35,380\nThere's a lot more for basic account\nsecurity that I wanna get into.\n\n1305\n01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:37,920\nWe still need to talk about\nfast user switching, and\n\n1306\n01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,900\nsome of the other security processes\nthat are built into Mac O/S,\n\n1307\n01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,010\nbut for this show it's\na pretty good spot to wrap up.\n\n1308\n01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,410\nSo, we're gonna wrap this one up.\n\n1309\n01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:48,760\nStay tuned we've got another episode,\nat least one more,\n\n1310\n01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,340\nwe'll probably go part two and\na part three on this,\n\n1311\n01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:55,030\nas we cover some of the other topics that\nare related to user accounts and security.\n\n1312\n01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:57,030\nSo stay tuned for those.\n\n1313\n01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:57,760\nNow let me remind you.\n\n1314\n01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,950\nIf you have any questions, on what\nI've covered today feel free to ask.\n\n1315\n01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:04,540\nLive during the show you\ncan go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n1316\n01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,820\nYou'll see the chatroom\nright beneath the video.\n\n1317\n01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,490\nYou can post your questions.\n\n1318\n01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:10,410\nWe monitor and answer

right.\n\n5\n00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,250\nGood morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n6\n00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,060\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,611\nI'm your host,\n\n8\n00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:44,700\nDon Pezet, back in with another episode\nof Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n9\n00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,460\nWe're gonna jump right\nback into user accounts.\n\n10\n00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,030\nYou might remember from the last episode.\n\n11\n00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,480\nWe took a look at how to\ncreate user accounts.\n\n12\n00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,930\nAnd how to use them on our system.\n\n13\n00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,150\nAnd kinda how they\nbehave inside of Mac OS.\n\n14\n00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,210\nNow we're gonna take a look at\ndealing with multiple user accounts\n\n15\n00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,130\non the same machine.\n\n16\n00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,440\nNot everybody shares their computer.\n\n17\n00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,900\nRight?\nI know I'm bad at sharing.\n\n18\n00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,370\nI missed that part of Kindergarten.\n\n19\n00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,370\nAnd so when I have a laptop or\na desktop, I'm typically the only user.\n\n20\n00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,460\nSo I have one user account and that's it.\n\n21\n00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,080\nBut if you have a shared computer.\n\n22\n00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,340\nWhere maybe you're sharing\nwith your family or\n\n23\n00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,715\ncoworkers, it's a good idea to\nuse separate user accounts.\n\n24\n00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:22,900\nSomeway you keep things like your\ndocuments separate and all that.\n\n25\n00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,100\nWell inside of Mac OS we have\na couple of neat features to\n\n26\n00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,430\nhelp when you're using more than one set\nof user accounts on the same machine.\n\n27\n00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,010\nNow let me preface all this by saying,\n\n28\n00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,490\nwe're addressing this really from the home\nuser type perspective on this section.\n\n29\n00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,380\nIn the ACTC course we'll take a look\nat what's called open directory,\n\n30\n00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,790\nhaving a centralized directory of\nuser accounts that machines share and\n\n31\n00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,390\na lot of the behavior we're gonna talk\nabout in this episode isn't the same,\n\n32\n00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,860\nwhen you have a shared\ndirectory like that.\n\n33\n00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,581\nFor a standalone machine, well there is\ncertain behaviors we need to be aware of\n\n34\n00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:59,030\nfor this example the ADSP, and\nthat is what were gonna take a look at.\n\n35\n00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,020\nRight here.\n\n36\n00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,530\nAll right, so let's get started.\n\n37\n00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,320\nFirst off, if you're like me, you probably\nhave a machine that's set up for one user.\n\n38\n00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,840\nThere's some interesting things\nthat change the instant you create\n\n39\n00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,370\na second user, all right?\n\n40\n00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,760\nSo for example, when I fire up my\ncomputer, I get to a logon screen.\n\n41\n00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,540\nAnd it will automatically show my little\nface and it'll ask me for my password.\n\n42\n00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,220\nIt knows who I am and\nthat I want to get logged in.\n\n43\n00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,850\nSo let's just take a look on my machine.\n\n44\n00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,280\nI'm set up as a single user but I want to\nshow you guys the behavior of a single\n\n45\n00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,290\nuser so we can spot what's different\nwhen we have multiple users.\n\n46\n00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,600\nWhen I go to login to my machine for\nexample,\n\n47\n00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,950\nthat's one of the big differences here.\n\n48\n00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,600\nLet me just log out real quick.\n\n49\n00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,380\nWhen I get to my login screen,\nwhen you only have a single user account,\n\n50\n00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,380\nthis is what you see when\nyour computer boots up.\n\n51\n00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,290\nYou see your icon and your password\nfield right here and you can log in.\n\n52\n00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,890\nAnd if you hit your back arrow,\nnot much happens.\n\n53\n00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,810\nIt really just makes the password field\ndisappears, and then you click on\n\n54\n00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,660\nyour icon and the password field\nreappears and you can log in.\n\n55\n00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,330\nIn a single user,\nthere's only one person who can log in.\n\n56\n00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,390\nSo, there's not too much for\nus to see right here on the login screen.\n\n57\n00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,150\nNow, once we get logged in,\nagain, you're the only user,\n\n58\n00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,500\nand so it renders your desktop and\nyour information.\n\n59\n00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,570\nYou're in and now you're working.\n\n60\n00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,220\nThe moment we add another user,\nthings change a little bit, all right?\n\n61\n00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,440\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n62\n00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,740\nI'm gonna go into my system preferences.\n\n63\n00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,710\nAnd then I'll go into my users and groups.\n\n64\n00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,410\nAnd in my users and\ngroups you'll see there's my user account.\n\n65\n00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,450\nIt was created when I installed Yosemite.\n\n66\n00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,790\nSo it's an administrator.\n\n67\n00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,170\nIt's there by default.\n\n68\n00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,270\nI can add more users if I want.\n\n69\n00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,830\nLet's say, I wanna share my computer with\none of the other guys here, in the office.\n\n70\n00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,830\nI'm gonna share my computer with Nate.\n\n71\n00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,590\nI go ahead and add him an account.\n\n72\n00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,870\nWell, you have to be\nan administrator to add accounts.\n\n73\n00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,840\nSo, I've gotta unlock this screen and\nprovide my administrator credentials.\n\n74\n00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,700\nAnd once that's done,\nI can add his account.\n\n75\n00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,050\nI'm just gonna add\na standard user account.\n\n76\n00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,790\nFor Nate, so\nwe'll get him punched in here.\n\n77\n00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,580\nI'll just set a standard password,\nI won't do iCloud for him.\n\n78\n00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,940\nNow that I've got it,\nit's in there, he's got an account.\n\n79\n00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,730\nNow the moment that account was created,\nsome things changed on the system.\n\n80\n00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,240\nYou might not have noticed it, especially\non a computer like mine, where I've got so\n\n81\n00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,280\nmuch stuff in my menu bar up here, all the\ndifferent little programs that I run, but\n\n82\n00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,140\nthe menu bar just got a little bit\nbigger when I created that account.\n\n83\n00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,450\nAs soon as I added his account,\nmy name appeared right up here in the bar.\n\n84\n00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,710\nAs soon as you add a second account,\n\n85\n00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,730\nyou'll see what's called\nfast user switching.\n\n86\n00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,320\nFast user switching is a service that's\nbuilt into Mac OS, it's been around for\n\n87\n00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,650\na few versions now.\n\n88\n00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,890\nAnd it allows you to quickly and\n\n89\n00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,160\neasily switch from one user to\nanother without logging out.\n\n90\n00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,360\nAnd because you can flip between users,\n\n91\n00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,580\nit's easy to lose track of\nwho you're logged in as.\n\n92\n00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,860\nAnd so by default, fast user switching\nadds your user name to the menu bar.\n\n93\n00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,049\nSo now I can see that's\nwho I'm logged in as.\n\n94\n00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,900\nIf I logout, I also notice that,\nthat screen's changed a little bit.\n\n95\n00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,580\nNow there's actual choices.\n\n96\n00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,220\nOkay.\n\n97\n00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,640\nWhen I get to my logon screen, I'll see\nmyself, but I also see Nate right there.\n\n98\n00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,480\nI can pick.\n\n99\n00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,160\nI can choose him.\n\n100\n00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,393\nWhich it picked a rose, for his icon,\nwhich is kinda appropriate.\n\n101\n00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,831\nI wouldn't go in there and login as him.\n\n102\n00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,410\nI have a choice.\n\n103\n00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:14,950\nRight?\n\n104\n00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,630\nIf I pick myself, there's the screen I\nsaw a moment ago in single user mode.\n\n105\n00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,160\nIf I hit the back arrow, instead of\njust making my password field disappear,\n\n106\n00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,830\nit makes it where I can pick\nbetween multiple accounts.\n\n107\n00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,610\nThat's actually what's happening\nin single user mode too.\n\n108\n00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,620\nYour password field\nisn't just disappearing.\n\n109\n00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,270\nIt's going back to the screen\nthat lists all the accounts,\n\n110\n00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,980\nonly you're the only account.\n\n111\n00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,330\nNow when we login.\n\n112\n00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,260\nSo if I get logged in here on the system.\n\n113\n00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,830\nI'm in and I'm ready to work.\n\n114\n00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,440\nAnd Nate comes along and says,\n\n115\n00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,620\nhey Don, I really need to\nuse the computer real quick.\n\n116\n00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,184\nCan I borrow it?\n\n117\n00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:51,630\nAnd I say sure, well, in the old modes,\n\n118\n00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,830\nwhat we'd have to do is we'd have\nto logout and let them log back in.\n\n119\n00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,160\nWell, if I'm in the middle of something,\nI'm in here writing my show notes, or\n\n120\n00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,810\nworking on some other documents, I'm busy.\n\n121\n00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:08,750\nI don't wanna stop what I'm doing just so\nthat Nate can use the computer.\n\n122\n00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,910\nAll right, so\nI'm just trying to fire some notes.\n\n123\n00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,540\nHere we go.\nI'm in the middle of working with some\n\n124\n00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,940\nshow notes, and\nI don't want to stop what I'm doing.\n\n125\n00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,050\nI don't want to have to save this and\ncome back into it and all that.\n\n126\n00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,100\nWith fast user switching, I can go right\nup that menu, where my name is, and\n\n127\n00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,560\nif you click on it, you'll see where you\ncan quickly switch between the users.\n\n128\n00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,038\nAnd I can switch over to Nate, and\nit's gonna allow me to jump right over and\n\n129\n00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:33,740\nlogin as him.\n\n130\n00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,580\nAnd now I'm logged in as Nate and\n\n131\n00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,830\nworking, meanwhile I'm still\nlogged in in the background.\n\n132\n00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,270\nSo Dan Pezet is still logged\nin in the background,\n\n133\n00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,700\nI had Xcode open with some\nof my show notes in it.\n\n134\n00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,060\nSo that's still there.\n\n135\n00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,760\nThat's all running in the background.\n\n136\n00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,100\nThose programs are not closed.\n\n137\n00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,060\nI didn't have to save my data.\n\n138\n00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,860\nThey're still running.\n\n139\n00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,320\nNow Nate can log in, he can do what\nhe wants, and when he's done I\n\n140\n00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,280\ncan just switch right back to myself and\nit's right where I left off, right?\n\n141\n00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,330\nSo here's Nate's account, and\n\n142\n00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,790\nyou'll see it's got Nathan Copeland\nwritten right up there in the menu bar.\n\n143\n00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,250\nAnd I can choose that, and notice how both\nof our user accounts have little orange\n\n144\n00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,030\ncircles beside them with a check mark?\n\n145\n00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,390\nThat's to let us know that\nthey're actively logged in.\n\n146\n00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,310\nSo right now, two people are logged\ninto to my computer at the same time.\n\n147\n00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,100\nThat's what fast user\nswitching is all about,\n\n148\n00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,020\nletting more than one person use\nthe computer at the same time.\n\n149\n00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,750\nAnd I can switch right back to myself,\nI can try and switch back myself.\n\n150\n00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,520\nApparently it doesn't want me to switch.\n\n151\n00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,490\nBut we can switch back to our other\naccount, and it'll just prompt for\n\n152\n00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,490\nthe password when it actually goes.\n\n153\n00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,210\nThis is the first time\nI've logged in as Nate, so\n\n154\n00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,530\nit's probably still building his\nprofile and it's not letting me switch.\n\n155\n00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,830\nI could always just logout I suppose.\n\n156\n00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,160\nBut I can switch back to my account and\nwhen I do I'll see all of my applications\n\n157\n00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,250\nare still running right there in place\neven though I didn't necessarily save.\n\n158\n00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,590\nSee how I've got that green.\n\n159\n00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,167\nI mean, green.\n\n160\n00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:57,302\nLook at that orange circle right there\ntelling me that I'm still logged in and\n\n161\n00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:59,600\nwhen I get logged in, there it is.\n\n162\n00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,500\nEverything right the way that I left off.\n\n163\n00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,125\nNow that's what fast user\nswitching is all about.\n\n164\n00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:09,773\nMaking that's, oh there it goes it just\nkicked in the log in request from when\n\n165\n00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:14,583\nNate was in there, it just kicked in so\ngreat so now it's a little bit confused.\n\n166\n00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:18,060\nBut basically we can quickly and\neasily switch between the accounts.\n\n167\n00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,770\nIf you don't share your computer,\nthis is meaningless to you,\n\n168\n00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,580\nyou don't care about it.\n\n169\n00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,540\nFast user switching who cares.\n\n170\n00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,980\nBut if you do share your computer this\nis a great easy way to be able to\n\n171\n00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,300\nquickly flip in-between users.\n\n172\n00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,830\nCouple of things we need to remember.\n\n173\n00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,130\nFirst of,\nfast user switching is installed and\n\n174\n00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,820\nturned on by default even for a single\nuser, you just don't notice it, all right.\n\n175\n00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,240\nIt's always running we\ndon't have to turn it on.\n\n176\n00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,190\nSecond.\n\n177\n00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,370\nThat menu bar item up here\nwhere we see the list of users,\n\n178\n00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,990\nthat can be turned on and off.\n\n179\n00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,020\nIf you don't like that,\n\n180\n00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,110\nif you don't want it displayed on\nthe screen, you can turn it off.\n\n181\n00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,890\nIt's actually in your System Preferences.\n\n182\n00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,890\nIf I go back into my System Preferences\nand go into Users and Groups,\n\n183\n00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:04,820\ninside of Users and Groups here, if I\nunlock the screen, and I go to the log in\n\n184\n00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,540\noptions right here, you'll see the option\nhere, show, fast, user switching menu.\n\n185\n00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,630\nIf I uncheck that the menu goes away,\nnow it's not up there and\n\n186\n00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,660\nit doesn't bother me.\n\n187\n00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,560\nThe risk there is, you might\nforget who you're logged in as, so\n\n188\n00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,950\nyou might sit at the computer thinking\nyou're logged in as yourself and\n\n189\n00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,180\nyou're actually logged\nin as one of your kids.\n\n190\n00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,370\nThe other option is instead of getting\nrid of that menu is to changed what's\n\n191\n00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,280\ndisplayed.\n\n192\n00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,470\nThe default is your full name is\ndisplayed and that's kind of big.\n\n193\n00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,990\nYou can change it to the Unix\naccount name if you want, but\n\n194\n00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,410\nthat's usually not much better.\n\n195\n00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,200\nThe third option though is\nto change it to an icon,\n\n196\n00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,670\nnow it's just gonna display a little\nblack silhouette icon up there.\n\n197\n00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,730\nAnd if you're ever wondering who you're\nlogged in as, you can just click on it and\n\n198\n00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,320\nit will show you.\n\n199\n00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,680\nYou'll be the grayed out person.\n\n200\n00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,790\nThe grayed out person is\nwho's logged in right now.\n\n201\n00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,100\nAnd you can quickly flip to\nthe other users if you want to also.\n\n202\n00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,260\nIt's got the option right there and\nyou can jump over to them, right?\n\n203\n00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,530\nWe can manipulate that menu how we want.\n\n204\n00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:01,870\nIf I jump over here to Nate, get logged in\nto his account, now if you logged in as\n\n205\n00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,660\nhim, and notice that menu was controlled\nby his account and my account separately.\n\n206\n00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,070\nRight, that's a user preference\nthat we need to set.\n\n207\n00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,890\nHe's still got that full name.\n\n208\n00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,700\nHe can change it to\na silhouette if he wants.\n\n209\n00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,250\nHe can go into that users and group\npreferences, and he can go into login\n\n210\n00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,420\noptions and see how he's not an\nadministrator, so he can't turn that off.\n\n211\n00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,540\nBut he can change the way it's displayed.\n\n212\n00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,820\nHe could switch to an icon also if\nhe wanted to, and now he's done it.\n\n213\n00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,150\nThat's fast user switching.\n\n214\n00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,660\nIt's pretty straightforward.\n\n215\n00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,210\nIt's a neat little system.\n\n216\n00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,210\nLets you quickly and\neasily flip between users.\n\n217\n00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,490\nHere, now it's quickly flipping over\nto my user like it's supposed to.\n\n218\n00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,160\nAnd off we go.\n\n219\n00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160\nKeep in mind a few other things.\n\n220\n00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,320\nWhen one user switches to another.\n\n221\n00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,550\nIf you stay logged in,\nyour programs are still running.\n\n222\n00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,460\nYour consuming memory and disk access.\n\n223\n00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,750\nYou can create a resource\nburden on your system,\n\n224\n00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,470\nif you have too many people all\nlogged in at the same time.\n\n225\n00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,970\nThe system can start to\nget a bit sluggish,.\n\n226\n00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,060\nThat actually reminds me of another\nthing that's important to point out,\n\n227\n00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,470\nis you can but heads with the other\npeople who are logged in.\n\n228\n00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,360\nNow when we do fast user switching,\nonly one person has the screen at a time,\n\n229\n00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,140\nthe other person is relegated\nto the background, so\n\n230\n00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,900\nthey can't really do anything, right?\n\n231\n00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,180\nBut if I was editing a file, and\n\n232\n00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,540\nthat file is still open and I switch over\nto Nate and Nate starts to edit that file.\n\n233\n00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,500\nWere editing the same file.\n\n234\n00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,590\nSome programs handle that okay, they'll\nbe okay with it will work out just fine.\n\n235\n00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,070\nOther programs it wont work,\nyou wont be able to open that file so\n\n236\n00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,480\nlike Microsoft Excel.\n\n237\n00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,630\nIf your running Microsoft Excel on your\nMac, and one user has a spreadsheet open,\n\n238\n00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,960\nand another user goes to open the same\nspreadsheet, they'll get an error.\n\n239\n00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,560\nIt won't allow two people\nto open it at once.\n\n240\n00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,490\nAlso, there's some programs that\ncan't be run more than once.\n\n241\n00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,660\nI might have a program\nrunning under my account, and\n\n242\n00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,270\nI switch over to Nate and now I can't\nrun the program under his account.\n\n243\n00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,650\nSome software does great with that,\n\n244\n00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,600\nmost of the software in the app\nstore does really well with that.\n\n245\n00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,220\nSome software doesn't.\n\n246\n00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,370\nAnd so\nyou might have bumped into problems there.\n\n247\n00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,870\nThese are all things to keep in mind.\n\n248\n00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,150\nThe last thing I want to mention\nabout fast user switching is\n\n249\n00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,310\na little bit of a security concern.\n\n250\n00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:15,100\nBe aware that, there are certain things\nyou do on your mac, that are considered\n\n251\n00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,460\nglobal, in other words they affect the\nentire mac regardless of who's logged in.\n\n252\n00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,760\nAnd some of the things aren't necessarily\nstuff we'd normally think of.\n\n253\n00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,590\nFor example, I'm logged in here, right?\n\n254\n00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,350\nThis is me, I'm on my machine.\n\n255\n00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,480\nAnd maybe I need to copy some show notes,\nand so\n\n256\n00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,260\nI go into my show notes and\nI find some show notes here.\n\n257\n00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,520\nI'll just take maybe some of these.\n\n258\n00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,610\nI don't wanna lose my show notes.\n\n259\n00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,002\nLet me do a little copy and\npaste action, there we go.\n\n260\n00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:47,300\nAll right, I've got some show notes over\nhere and I wanna copy those to another\n\n261\n00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,230\ncomputer, so I take my USB key, and\nI plug it into the computer right.\n\n262\n00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,060\nI get my USB key plugged in,\nit'll pop up on my desktop.\n\n263\n00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,940\nEventually.\n\n264\n00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,760\nThere we go.\n\n265\n00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,010\nI can see Don's USB key right here and\nit's empty so I take my show notes and\n\n266\n00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,790\nI throw it on there.\n\n267\n00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,040\nI'm just working with this like I\nnormally do not thinking too much about\n\n268\n00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,670\nwhat's going on.\n\n269\n00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,930\nAll right.\n\n270\n00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,740\nWell if I fast user switch, and I jump\nover to Nathan, when I jump over to his\n\n271\n00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,950\naccount, we can get in here, here's\nhis desktop, and there's that USB key.\n\n272\n00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,130\nRight.\n\n273\n00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,760\nHe doesn't have access to my profile.\n\n274\n00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,550\nIf he were to try to browse\nthe hard drive and, browse in and\n\n275\n00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,760\nget to, like, the users folder or\nmy profile or\n\n276\n00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,280\nsomething, he's not gonna\nhave access to that.\n\n277\n00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,094\nAnd let me get that to show up in here.\n\n278\n00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:42,796\nThere we go.\n\n279\n00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:45,520\nIf you were to browse into the hard drive,\nand\n\n280\n00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,930\nbrowse into the Users folder,\nand try and browse into dpezet.\n\n281\n00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,480\nAnd into my desktop.\n\n282\n00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,410\nHe can't get there.\n\n283\n00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:52,970\nRight.\n\n284\n00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,220\nHe can't see my desktop,\nhe can't see my documents.\n\n285\n00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,830\nBut I put stuff on that USB key,\nand he can see the USB key.\n\n286\n00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,210\nThat's shared across the system.\n\n287\n00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,510\nWhen you plug in removable media,\n\n288\n00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,270\nthe people you that you fast switch\nto will be able to see that also.\n\n289\n00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,040\nIf you're gonna use fast,\nuse the switching with removable media.\n\n290\n00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,940\nYou need to make sure you pop it out,\nbefore you fast user switch.\n\n291\n00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,170\nAll right, so, that, in a nutshell,\nis fast user switching.\n\n292\n00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,060\nAnd it's a big difference between\nhaving a single user on a computer\n\n293\n00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,460\nversus a shared computer.\n\n294\n00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,542\nIt's a neat feature, it's not hard to use,\nand it's pretty important to turn up.\n\n295\n00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:31,860\nAll right well that's probably enough for\nthis segment.\n\n296\n00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,690\nWhat we'll do is well stop and\ntake a break.\n\n297\n00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,820\nWhen we get back,\n\n298\n00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,770\nI want to talk a little bit more about\nthings we do with multiple user accounts.\n\n299\n00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,310\nIn particular I want to take\na look parental controls and\n\n300\n00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,830\nhow we can kind of control the access\nof some of the other users.\n\n301\n00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,553\nStay tuned.\n\n302\n00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:47,946\nWe've got parental controls,\ncoming up next.\n\n303\n00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:55,378\n[MUSIC]\n\n304\n00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:57,050\nAll right welcome back everybody.\n\n305\n00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,036\nIn the first segment we took\na look at fast user switching and\n\n306\n00:15:00,036 --> 00:15:02,840\nhow we can share our\ncomputer with other users.\n\n307\n00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,380\nIn this segment, I want to build on that,\nwith Parental Controls.\n\n308\n00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,750\nA lot of times when we share a computer,\nwe're sharing it with our children, or\n\n309\n00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,200\nour people that we're at\nleast responsible for.\n\n310\n00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,290\nAnd in those cases, it's a good idea,\nin addition to our own supervision,\n\n311\n00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,660\ndon't forget that, there's no\nsubstitute for proper supervision, but\n\n312\n00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,480\nin addition to that,\nto impose certain limits, on that user,\n\n313\n00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,980\nand how they're able to use the computer.\n\n314\n00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,830\nApple is fully aware this was given\na great suite of utilities built\n\n315\n00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:34,090\nright into MAC OS that we can use to\ncontrol that access, and it is perfect for\n\n316\n00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,100\nmanaging children's accounts.\n\n317\n00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,410\nFirst off let me show you how to flag\nan account as a child's account, and\n\n318\n00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,570\nthen we'll see how to go in and\nrestrict that, and limit it.\n\n319\n00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,190\nThere's two different ways\nto set up a child's account.\n\n320\n00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,560\nOne way is if we've already\ngot the account created.\n\n321\n00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,850\nAnd another way is if we're\ncreating an account from scratch.\n\n322\n00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,670\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm going\nto go into my system preferences.\n\n323\n00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,260\nAnd I'll go into Users and Groups.\n\n324\n00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,410\nAnd you'll see I've already got one\naccount created here for Nathan Copeland.\n\n325\n00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,667\nHe's our producer.\n\n326\n00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:05,010\nAnd I'm gonna create a second account for\nour director.\n\n327\n00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,875\nOur director We used Jason Phillips,\nwe'll get him added in here.\n\n328\n00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:14,180\nI like to pick on all of our\nemployees here whenever I can.\n\n329\n00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,375\nSo I'm gonna go in and\ncreate an account for him.\n\n330\n00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,750\nAnd when I create that new account, what\nyou'll see is a little drop down box at\n\n331\n00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,290\nthe top where it asks me\nwhat type of account.\n\n332\n00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,860\nAnd we saw this in an earlier episode.\n\n333\n00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,230\nBut the one I'm going to choose is,\nmanage with parental controls.\n\n334\n00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,360\nIt's going to be a standard user, but\n\n335\n00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,420\nit's going to have parental\ncontrols attached to it.\n\n336\n00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,960\nSo this kind of flags it\nas a childs' account.\n\n337\n00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,930\nBut this is somebody whose access\nis going to be somewhat restricted.\n\n338\n00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,240\nSo, I'll go in and assign a password or\nyou might choose to not have a password.\n\n339\n00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,540\nIt's usually a good idea to have one.\n\n340\n00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,070\nSo I will go ahead and assign that.\n\n341\n00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,840\nSee how Jason shows up\nas a managed account.\n\n342\n00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,590\n[COUGH] What about Nate?\n\n343\n00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,780\nI created Nate's account earlier,\nand he is a standard user.\n\n344\n00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,420\nSo is it too late for him?\n\n345\n00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,350\nWell in real life yes it\nprobably is too late for him but\n\n346\n00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,660\nhere in this computer we can\nat least fix this problem.\n\n347\n00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,740\nIt's really easy to flag somebody's\nmanagement parental controls.\n\n348\n00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,420\nWhen you highlight their account, you\nwill see the check mark over here, enable\n\n349\n00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,670\nparental controls and we can just check\nthat of and see how we change to managed.\n\n350\n00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,800\nSo you don't have to create\nthem as a managed account.\n\n351\n00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,360\nYou can always change it later.\n\n352\n00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,180\nAnd the idea is that as they grow older,\n\n353\n00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,800\nmaybe they reach a point where they\ndon't need to be managed anymore.\n\n354\n00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,830\nYou would uncheck that and\nthey become a standard user again.\n\n355\n00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,870\nSo real easy to move them back and forth.\n\n356\n00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,080\nBetween those different accounts.\n\n357\n00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:35,450\nAll right so now I got Nate and Jason,\nthey're both right there, they are set up.\n\n358\n00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,770\nThey're both are flagged for parental\ncontrols, now what does that mean?\n\n359\n00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,680\nThat means they're gonna have slightly\nrestricted access to the system.\n\n360\n00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,420\nThere is certain default values\nthat are put in place already.\n\n361\n00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,590\nBut I do need to go and\n\n362\n00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,220\nvisit those options and\ncustomize them the way we need them.\n\n363\n00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,040\nWell what Apple does is they provide\na nice little utility here in system\n\n364\n00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,260\npreferences called parental controls.\n\n365\n00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,170\nIt's right there besides users and groups.\n\n366\n00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,450\nIf we go in there they divide\nthe settings up in to five categories.\n\n367\n00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,170\nWell, the categories have all\nsorts of custom settings, and\n\n368\n00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,120\nwe can adjust those on a per user basis.\n\n369\n00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,150\nIt's real important that we have it\nper user, because you might have one\n\n370\n00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,090\nof your kids might be eight years old and\nthe other one is 14 years old, so\n\n371\n00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,960\nyou might have very different\nrestrictions based on their age.\n\n372\n00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,490\nWell, I'm gonna go ahead and unlock this.\n\n373\n00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,310\nYou do have to be an administrator to make\nchanges to the Parental Controls, and\n\n374\n00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:32,290\nonce I'm in, I've got Jason and Nate\nright here, and I can pick each one, and\n\n375\n00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,380\nI can customize the settings for\nthem, right.\n\n376\n00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,700\nLet's start with that first tab there.\n\n377\n00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,770\nIf I take Jason's account here,\nthe first tab is Apps.\n\n378\n00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,090\nI can restrict what apps\nthe user is allowed to run.\n\n379\n00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,310\nI can say, for example, that I want\nto limit their applications and\n\n380\n00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,950\nfor the app store, I might want to limit\nthem to apps that were in the app store,\n\n381\n00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,510\nrated to, let's say up to age nine.\n\n382\n00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,960\nI don't want him to be able to run\nany app store apps that are rated for\n\n383\n00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,110\npeople over the age of nine, all right.\n\n384\n00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,320\nSo I can specify that and\nit's going to limit it.\n\n385\n00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,560\nBlanket across the app store.\n\n386\n00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,090\nFor my local apps though,\nones that I've side loaded or\n\n387\n00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,590\ninstalled directly from the internet,\nI can control those down here.\n\n388\n00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,440\nI can go under other apps, and\n\n389\n00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,890\nI'll see the applications that\nare right here on my own system.\n\n390\n00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,840\nThere's a ton of stuff that's in here.\n\n391\n00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,970\nRight.\nGoogle Chrome,\n\n392\n00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,360\nall the different software I've installed\n\n393\n00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360\nover the last several\nmonths in this laptop.\n\n394\n00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,230\nAnd so you'll see those.\n\n395\n00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,240\nYou can check them off and specify what\nyou want them to be allowed to run.\n\n396\n00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,940\nAnd what you don't want\nthem to be allowed to run.\n\n397\n00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,570\nYou also see widgets.\n\n398\n00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,010\nThe desktop and launcher widgets.\n\n399\n00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,000\nAll those things,\nthey're getting to be very, very powerful.\n\n400\n00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,230\nThey're basically full-on apps now.\n\n401\n00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,660\nAnd so you can go in and customize what\napps or widgets they're allowed to use.\n\n402\n00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,010\nThere's system utilities, and\n\n403\n00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,390\ntypically you don't want any system\nutility to be able to run for\n\n404\n00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,590\none of these protected accounts, so\nthey're all turned off by default.\n\n405\n00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,250\nBut you can choose those too.\n\n406\n00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,560\nYou just check them off, and\nuncheck them as you desire.\n\n407\n00:19:59,170 --> 00:19:59,870\nAll right.\nNow, one\n\n408\n00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,980\nproblem with limiting the applications\nlike this is when you limit them,\n\n409\n00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,520\nthey'll still see all the applications.\n\n410\n00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,960\nThey see it all.\n\n411\n00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,160\nBut, if they try and open an application\nthey're not allowed to run,\n\n412\n00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,690\nit just gives them an access deny,\n\n413\n00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,580\nand it gives the administrator\na chance override it if they want.\n\n414\n00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,680\nInstead, you could turn on what's called\nthe simple finder, and the simple\n\n415\n00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,350\nfinder will hide all the icons for\napplications they're not allowed to run.\n\n416\n00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,270\nIt simplifies that user interface.\n\n417\n00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,140\nThey just see the programs you want.\n\n418\n00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:34,590\nAll right, so maybe for Jason I just\nwant him to see certain App Store apps,\n\n419\n00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,950\nor maybe I don't want him to\nsee App Store apps at all.\n\n420\n00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,190\nI'll just say Don't allow.\n\n421\n00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,810\nNo App Store apps for you, right.\n\n422\n00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:45,960\nAnd maybe no widgets, and under other\napps, I'm gonna uncheck all of those.\n\n423\n00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,250\nAnd maybe I just wanna go through and\npick out a few apps specifically for him.\n\n424\n00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,370\nNow notice how I unchecked it, right.\n\n425\n00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,960\nI cleared this other App.\n\n426\n00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,720\nAnd see how some are still checked.\n\n427\n00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,160\nThese are system apps ones that came with\nApple or ones that I've flagged as default\n\n428\n00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,160\nso like calculator,\ncalendar those are included with mac os.\n\n429\n00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,180\nChrome is still lit because I've got it\nflagged as the default web browser but\n\n430\n00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,820\nmaybe I don't want him to\nuse a web browser at all.\n\n431\n00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,530\nI'll uncheck that, and\nI'll uncheck Safari too as I go.\n\n432\n00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:19,440\nSo now as I've started to change it,\nsee how the other check marks went away?\n\n433\n00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,550\nNow it's cleared out and now I am actually\npicking things the way that I want.\n\n434\n00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,850\nSo maybe I'll give them calculator,\nwe'll take away contact access.\n\n435\n00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:33,540\nWe'll give him disk inventory x, he needs\nto be able to see disk utilization.\n\n436\n00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,060\nWhat else might we want him to have?\n\n437\n00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,040\nJust whatever programs it is that\nyou want them to be able to use.\n\n438\n00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,280\nYou go through and check or uncheck them.\n\n439\n00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,850\nRight.\n\n440\n00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,760\nSo, I've got calculator and\ndisc inventory, right.\n\n441\n00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,410\nSo that's what I'll have checked.\n\n442\n00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,370\nSo now he's gonna be restricted\njust to those programs.\n\n443\n00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,610\nReally useful, you might have\nsome educational programs and\n\n444\n00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,320\nyou tie it just to that.\n\n445\n00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,310\nAll right, some of the other\nthings that we can adjust.\n\n446\n00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,280\nI'll flip over to Nate for this one.\n\n447\n00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,390\nThe next tab is web.\n\n448\n00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,920\nAnd under the web settings we can control\nwhat websites they're allowed to get to.\n\n449\n00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,020\nAnd so you'll see where you can\nlimit access to adult web sites.\n\n450\n00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,070\nThat's on by default.\n\n451\n00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,045\nBy default,\nit's trying to block pornography sites.\n\n452\n00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:14,035\nYou can go even further and say,\nallow access only to these websites, and\n\n453\n00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:16,145\nnow we can get really specific.\n\n454\n00:22:16,145 --> 00:22:18,575\nAnd enter just the websites\nthey can get to.\n\n455\n00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:20,645\nThere are a few in here that\nare logged by default, but\n\n456\n00:22:20,645 --> 00:22:22,495\nyou can add them in pretty easy.\n\n457\n00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:24,995\nI'll add in IT Pro TV.\n\n458\n00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:29,260\nSo, I'll just punch that site in.\n\n459\n00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,690\nAnd you can add in whatever other\nsites that you feel like you need.\n\n460\n00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,220\nRight.\nSo I might add CNN, or whatever,\n\n461\n00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,150\nalthough CNN is pretty bad these days,\nbut we'll go ahead and add it anyway.\n\n462\n00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,300\nAll right, so we can add those sites in,\nand now we've got them.\n\n463\n00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,500\nSo this is going to restrict\nTheir web experience.\n\n464\n00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,760\nFor Jason's account, I just blocked his\naccess to web browsers all together.\n\n465\n00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,300\nThat's one way to do it, right.\n\n466\n00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,510\nFor Nate's account,\nI'm blocking access to specific sites.\n\n467\n00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,820\nNow for Nate's account,\nI might wanna go into the apps here and\n\n468\n00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,780\ngive him that simple finder,\nrestrict his access to certain programs,\n\n469\n00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,560\nlock him into just Safari,\nhowever I wanna go about that.\n\n470\n00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,710\nSo you can kinda tailor and\ncustomize that as you need.\n\n471\n00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,393\nAnd let's see.\n\n472\n00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:12,113\nIs Safari checked?\n\n473\n00:23:12,113 --> 00:23:12,694\nIt is.\n\n474\n00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:13,239\nRight.\n\n475\n00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:17,205\nVersus Jason's account where I just\nremoved access to that web browser\n\n476\n00:23:17,205 --> 00:23:18,070\nall together.\n\n477\n00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,500\nThe next tab is people.\n\n478\n00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,230\nHere you can control who they're\nallowed to communicate with.\n\n479\n00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:27,760\nAnd this is probably the most critical\noption set for protecting a minor.\n\n480\n00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,350\nWhen children get on\nthe internet it's very easy for\n\n481\n00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,980\nthem to get into communications with\npeople that are false finder identity.\n\n482\n00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,920\nYou hear about it all too often,\nit's entirely too easy.\n\n483\n00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,110\nSo it's probably a good\nidea to prevent that.\n\n484\n00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,730\nUnfortunately there are some\ntechnologies like Game Center\n\n485\n00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,000\nthat really lend themselves to this easy\nencountering of people you dont want.\n\n486\n00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,340\nSo you can come in here and\n\n487\n00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,030\nyou can block Game Center functionality,\nyou can stop that communication.\n\n488\n00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,950\nYou can limit their email so\n\n489\n00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:57,590\nthat they can only email people that you\napprove, right, to allowed contacts.\n\n490\n00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,125\nAnd your allowed contacts are right here.\n\n491\n00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:03,749\nYou can limit iMessage, or\nmessages is the new name, limit it just so\n\n492\n00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:07,042\nthey can only communicate\nto allowed contacts.\n\n493\n00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:12,917\nSo, I might say, I want my son to\nbe able to communicate to, Me.\n\n494\n00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:15,167\nSo I'll come in here and\njust put myself in.\n\n495\n00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:19,930\nAnd don@itpro.tv is an email account.\n\n496\n00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,540\nAnd I'll add that in.\n\n497\n00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,540\nSo now that's an allowed contact\nthat Nathan will be able to email.\n\n498\n00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,350\nAnd you get this send request here.\n\n499\n00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,940\nRight?\nWhat happens if somebody\n\n500\n00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,630\ntries to communicate with.\n\n501\n00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,290\nWith Nathan here and\nthere's not an allowed sender.\n\n502\n00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:39,158\nWell, I can say to forward that to me and\nthen I can make the decision as to whether\n\n503\n00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:41,785\nor not I want to approve that access or\nnot.\n\n504\n00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:45,910\nThe next tab are time limits.\n\n505\n00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,610\nTime limits are another great way that\nwe can restrict a user's access and\n\n506\n00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,600\nApple gives us two ways to do it.\n\n507\n00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,760\nMethod one is limiting the total amount\n\n508\n00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,230\nof time they're allowed to\nuse the computer per day.\n\n509\n00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,940\nSo maybe you say all right,\nyou get two hours of computer use per day.\n\n510\n00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,230\nDoesn't matter if you wanna do one hour in\nthe morning, one hour in the evening, or\n\n511\n00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,240\na half an hour here, half an hour there.\n\n512\n00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,580\nBut throughout the entire day,\nyou're limited to two hours, all right?\n\n513\n00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,340\nSo that's what we see\nright up here at the top.\n\n514\n00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,630\nThe Weekday and Weekend Time Limits.\n\n515\n00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,200\nHow much time do they get?\n\n516\n00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,350\nSo maybe on a weekday,\nwe limit Nate to one hour.\n\n517\n00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,500\nOn a weekend, we limit him to three hours.\n\n518\n00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,180\nRight.\n\n519\n00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,960\nAfter he's used the computer for\nthree hours,\n\n520\n00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,120\nin that 24 hour period, he won't be\nable to login again until the next day.\n\n521\n00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,690\nRight.\nInstead,\n\n522\n00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,470\nhe's gotta go outside and\nplay like we all did when we were kids.\n\n523\n00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,600\nSo you can specify those settings right\nthere, and now it's limited access.\n\n524\n00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,940\nYou can go even further.\n\n525\n00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,100\nAnd you can set time limits for\nwhen they're allowed to use the computer.\n\n526\n00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,770\nAnd so right down here we'll\nsee prevent access to this\n\n527\n00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,130\ncomputer during the specified hours.\n\n528\n00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,630\nNow be aware of that.\n\n529\n00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,350\nWe're specifying when they're prevented.\n\n530\n00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,562\nNot necessarily when they're allowed.\n\n531\n00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:53,992\nSo the defaults here\nare that I can come in and\n\n532\n00:25:53,992 --> 00:25:59,017\nsay on school nights,\ndon't allow access from 11 PM to 9 AM.\n\n533\n00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,334\nThat means starting at 9 AM\nthey can use the computer, and\n\n534\n00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:03,430\nthen at 11 PM it would cut out for\nthem, all right?\n\n535\n00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,160\nAnd on weekends you can\nspecify alternate hours.\n\n536\n00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,110\nSo maybe on the weekdays, I don't want\nthem using the computer in the morning,\n\n537\n00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,190\njust in the evening.\n\n538\n00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:19,390\nSo I might come in here and say that\nI want to cut off access, at 8 PM.\n\n539\n00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,650\nSo maybe 8 PM is bedtime.\n\n540\n00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,789\nAnd then, don't allow access\nagain until the next day.\n\n541\n00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:26,580\nMaybe when they get home from school.\n\n542\n00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,933\nSo I might set this to 3:30 PM.\n\n543\n00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:31,664\nAll right?\n\n544\n00:26:31,664 --> 00:26:35,500\nSo, at 8 PM, it blocks their access.\n\n545\n00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,990\nAnd their access doesn't come back again\nuntil the next day at 3:30 PM, all right?\n\n546\n00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,500\nSo, they won't be able to use\nthe computer in the morning.\n\n547\n00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,470\nYou can specify different times for\nthe weekend also, if you want.\n\n548\n00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,500\nI'm not going to specify these\nhere because I want to log in as\n\n549\n00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,150\nNate here in a moment.\n\n550\n00:26:49,405 --> 00:26:54,115\nThe last tab is Other and this is where\nApple stacked in just a few other\n\n551\n00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:57,795\noptions that are kind of nice things\nto have to protect your system.\n\n552\n00:26:57,795 --> 00:27:00,275\nOne of the big things that\nwe worry about as a parent,\n\n553\n00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:02,125\nI know I worry about this with my kids.\n\n554\n00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:07,715\nIs, you do not want someone on\nthe internet ease dropping or\n\n555\n00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:09,740\nspying on your children.\n\n556\n00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,280\nBlocking communications\nthrough iMessage and email.\n\n557\n00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,040\nThat's one method that's\none step in that journey.\n\n558\n00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,280\nYou'll probably also want to\nblock access to the webcam and\n\n559\n00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,190\nmicrophone on the computer too.\n\n560\n00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,610\nYou'll see that option right here.\n\n561\n00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:26,020\nWe can block the webcam, we can block\ndictation, block the microphone and\n\n562\n00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,090\nthat'll stop those communications\nmechanisms, right?\n\n563\n00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,930\nIf someone were to hack into your\ncomputer and take over that camera,\n\n564\n00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,870\nyou don't want them watching your\nchildren while they use the computer.\n\n565\n00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,940\nRight?\nSo we can just block that\n\n566\n00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,710\naccess right there.\n\n567\n00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:41,470\nAlso, some children,\nI'm sure you guys have heard about this,\n\n568\n00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:44,760\ndo some slightly inappropriate things\nwith the cameras on their devices.\n\n569\n00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,440\nYou might want to just block\nthat outright to prevent it.\n\n570\n00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,710\nAlthough, probably a good conversation\nwith the kids could knock that out too.\n\n571\n00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,110\nWhichever way you choose.\n\n572\n00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,980\nAll right, we've also got high\nprofanity in the dictionary.\n\n573\n00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,710\nSo, the dictionary that's built into\nMac OS does have swear words in it, and\n\n574\n00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,440\nyou can choose to conceal those.\n\n575\n00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,790\nWe've got Limit Printer administration.\n\n576\n00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,170\nYou want your kids to be able to print\ntheir homework and other documents but\n\n577\n00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,160\nyou don't necessarily want them\nto change the default printer or\n\n578\n00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,790\nmodify the settings so\nwe can restrict that access.\n\n579\n00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,270\nWe've got disable changing the password.\n\n580\n00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,540\nNow not everybody does this, but if you've\nassigned a password to your child's\n\n581\n00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,450\naccount, you may want to\nmake sure that you know it.\n\n582\n00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,890\nWell if they change it,\nyou don't know it anymore, right?\n\n583\n00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,810\nSo you might choose to block their\nability to change the password.\n\n584\n00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,230\nThat way you'll know what it is.\n\n585\n00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,750\nAnd then lastly you can limit CD and\nDVD burning.\n\n586\n00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,110\nNot a whole lot of point\nin that these days.\n\n587\n00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,620\nMost people don't do it anymore.\n\n588\n00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,780\nBut if you want to prevent them from\nburning disks with information,\n\n589\n00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,490\nyou can block that access.\n\n590\n00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:46,290\nOnce you've got all this set in place the\nway that you want it, just test it out.\n\n591\n00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,910\nIt's always a good idea to test\nthe settings to make sure they work\n\n592\n00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,300\nthe way you anticipated them to.\n\n593\n00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,390\nSo for Nate for example I've restricted\nthe apps that he has available.\n\n594\n00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,140\nI've restricted his web access.\n\n595\n00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,390\nSo I've put several restrictions in place.\n\n596\n00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,400\nLet's test it.\n\n597\n00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,940\nThe main reason we need to test is that\n\n598\n00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,725\nall your Apple software\nthat's gonna work fine.\n\n599\n00:29:05,725 --> 00:29:09,445\nBut some third party software does not\nplay all that nice with parental controls.\n\n600\n00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:12,415\nSo you might have to experiment\nwith it a bit to get it right.\n\n601\n00:29:12,415 --> 00:29:15,595\nYou might have one program,\nbut it calls other programs.\n\n602\n00:29:15,595 --> 00:29:17,065\nSo you actually have to approve more than\n\n603\n00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:18,375\none in the list to get\nit to function right.\n\n604\n00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:22,385\nAll right, so what I'm going to do,\nis I'm gonna switch over to Nate.\n\n605\n00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,200\nAnd I'll log in as his account.\n\n606\n00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,120\nNow, I chose for him to have\nthe simplified finder, so when he logs in,\n\n607\n00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,170\nhis user interface should\nbe significantly reduced.\n\n608\n00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,900\nBecause this is the first time he's\nlogged in since I made the change,\n\n609\n00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,150\nit's gonna take a little\nlonger than normal.\n\n610\n00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,880\nIn the first segment you saw me log\nin as him and it was pretty quick.\n\n611\n00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,580\nHere, it had to build\nthe simplified finder.\n\n612\n00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,380\nSo, here I am.\n\n613\n00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,470\nI'm logged in.\n\n614\n00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,380\nAnd notice I don't see any hard drives up\nhere, and my dock is almost empty, right?\n\n615\n00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,720\nVery little in there and it's ready to go.\n\n616\n00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,360\nNow I use a little remote desktop program\ncalled jump desktop and it tried to run\n\n617\n00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,630\nin the background and parental\ncontrols kicked in and stopped it.\n\n618\n00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:05,960\nSo I've got a message up here on\nmy screen that that was blocked.\n\n619\n00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,720\nSo I just need to make a decision here,\ndo I want that to run for\n\n620\n00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,270\nmy child or whoever, or not?\n\n621\n00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,760\nIf I want to allow it, I can choose\nadd website and I can punch that in.\n\n622\n00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,070\nIf I don't want to allow it though,\n\n623\n00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:22,280\nI can just hit okay and it was blocked and\nthat was it and in fact,\n\n624\n00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,240\nI've got a couple of those programs,\nlet me just quit out of these.\n\n625\n00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,800\nIt would be a good idea for\nme to add these to the list of,\n\n626\n00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,790\nyou know, what is it doing?\n\n627\n00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,690\nI want this to go away.\n\n628\n00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,970\nThere we go.\n\n629\n00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,260\nSometimes software just\ndoesn't want to go away.\n\n630\n00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,830\nAnd privileges required to close it.\n\n631\n00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,972\nThat's awesome.\n\n632\n00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,460\nAll right, well,\nlet me do that real quick.\n\n633\n00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,440\nAnd then this is just a great\nexample of testing, right?\n\n634\n00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,390\nI probably need to add these to the block\nlist so that he can't run them and\n\n635\n00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,600\nthen they won't run in his system and\nit won't bother him, but\n\n636\n00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,650\nonce he's logged in he can launch\nthe finder if he wants and jump in there.\n\n637\n00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,140\nAnd you'll see a limited view.\n\n638\n00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,920\nAnd the finder's gonna go kinda slow for\n\n639\n00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,110\nme here because it's the first\ntime he's logged in.\n\n640\n00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,300\nI'm gonna just skip right\nover to My Applications.\n\n641\n00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,080\nWhen I go to My Applications, notice\nthe Application View is a lot different.\n\n642\n00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,370\nInstead of a scrollable window,\n\n643\n00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,570\nI have these little buttons\nwhere I can jump page to page.\n\n644\n00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,980\nAnd so I'm seeing all the different\napplications that were approved for\n\n645\n00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,630\nthis user, all right?\n\n646\n00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,050\nAnd some of these are ones that\ncame built in with Mac OS.\n\n647\n00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,530\nOther ones are ones that I've installed,\nlike Entropy or Firefox.\n\n648\n00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,760\nSo, those are in his approved list.\n\n649\n00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,030\nThe apps that were blocked\naren't showing up.\n\n650\n00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,690\nHe doesn't see those, but\n\n651\n00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,320\napps like calculator,\nI put those in and they're there.\n\n652\n00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:44,380\nAll right, now if I fire up Safari,\nand go to browse the internet, right?\n\n653\n00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,450\nWell, I put a restricted web\nenvironment on for Nate, right?\n\n654\n00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,880\nSo, if I try and\ngo somewhere like google.com, well,\n\n655\n00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,790\nthat was in the protected list, or\nit was not in the protected list, sorry.\n\n656\n00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,960\nSo I get an oops,\nyou can't see this website.\n\n657\n00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,700\nIt won't let me go to that website.\n\n658\n00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,550\nIt's not approved, right?\n\n659\n00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,167\nAnd then it lists for\nme the sites that he can get to.\n\n660\n00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:08,477\nSo I see Disney and\nApple and so forth, and\n\n661\n00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:11,125\nthen there's ITProTV\nthat I added to the list.\n\n662\n00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:14,458\nSo we can click on that and\ngo to the site, and there he is, right.\n\n663\n00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:18,333\nSo now I've put a wall around\nhis internet experience.\n\n664\n00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:21,300\nHe can only get to the sites\nthat I've specifically approved.\n\n665\n00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,750\nAnd that's really the way to do it.\n\n666\n00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,730\nI know some parents go out and\n\n667\n00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:28,020\nbuy third-party software that maintains\nautomatic blacklists for banned sites.\n\n668\n00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,820\nAnd on those, you're picking which sites\nto block and allowing everything else, but\n\n669\n00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,270\nthe problem is new sites come out every\nsingle day with inappropriate material.\n\n670\n00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,840\nIt's too hard to keep up with that.\n\n671\n00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,550\nIt's much easier to keep up with\nthe list of allowed sites, and so\n\n672\n00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,790\nhere we control it and we specify that.\n\n673\n00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:49,310\nAnd if they go to a site that's not\nallowed, like I allowed CNN, right?\n\n674\n00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:52,580\nAnd so there we go but maybe you\nget tired of the leftist news and\n\n675\n00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,640\nyou decide to go to Fox News\nto get the rightist news.\n\n676\n00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,570\nAnd, oh shoot,\ndid I add that to the approved list?\n\n677\n00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,780\nI did not think I had added\nthat to the approved list.\n\n678\n00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,360\nWe just got to an unauthorized site.\n\n679\n00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,900\nOh, you know it might be because\nthe bookmarks are bleeding over, shoot.\n\n680\n00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,920\nWell if I go back to Google, for\nexample, Google is one that got blocked.\n\n681\n00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,750\nSee I've got this add website\nbutton right there, so I can\n\n682\n00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,050\nadd that website to the user, and now\nthey'll be allowed to have that access.\n\n683\n00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,680\nAnd it's gonna prompt because you'll\nhave to be an administrator to\n\n684\n00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,330\nadd that website to the list.\n\n685\n00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,870\nAnd so it's learning about\nnot being secure there.\n\n686\n00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,120\nBut it's trying to open the page,\nit can't do it.\n\n687\n00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,430\nAs an administrator,\nI can go and add it to the list.\n\n688\n00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,200\nSame thing goes for blocked applications.\n\n689\n00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,340\nIf they run a blocked application,\nas an administrator we'll have a choice.\n\n690\n00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:40,250\nWe can tell them it's okay to\nopen the application once.\n\n691\n00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,120\nOr we can say,\nit's okay to open it all the time, and\n\n692\n00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,590\nit'll add it to that white list.\n\n693\n00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,620\nSo different ways to handle it there,\nto restrict those accounts.\n\n694\n00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,970\nBut it's pretty cool stuff.\n\n695\n00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,240\nIt's all built in to Mac OS.\n\n696\n00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,320\nThat's the real nice part about this.\n\n697\n00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,350\nWe didn't have to install\nthird party software,\n\n698\n00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,320\nit's baked into the operating system.\n\n699\n00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,300\nThat's about it for parental controls.\n\n700\n00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,050\nObviously, there's a ton of settings\nin there you can mess around with.\n\n701\n00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:04,550\nExperiment.\n\n702\n00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,030\nYou'll find some cool things.\n\n703\n00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,100\nBut for most of us,\nthose are the options that we need to see.\n\n704\n00:34:10,285 --> 00:34:13,135\nWell that's about it for\nmultiple user accounts.\n\n705\n00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,375\nIn this show we took a look in the very\nbeginning about fast user switching and\n\n706\n00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,015\nhow that works.\n\n707\n00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:18,155\nPretty neat stuff there.\n\n708\n00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:21,625\nLet's us quickly move between user\naccounts without logging out.\n\n709\n00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,805\nRight, we had more than one person\nlogged in at the same time.\n\n710\n00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:28,585\nAnd then our last segment we talked about\nparental control and ways that we can\n\n711\n00:34:28,585 --> 00:34:32,085\nrestrict those accounts and\ncontrol their experience inside of Mac OS.\n\n712\n00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,200\nAlright well I hope you\nguys enjoyed the show.\n\n713\n00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,320\nLet me remind you, if you have any\nquestions on this live during the show you\n\n714\n00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,790\ncan go to the itpro.tv/live and

00:00:38,796\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:40,065\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:44,060\nback again with another episode of\nApple Certified Board Professional.\n\n6\n00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,780\nWe're gonna be wrapping\nup user accounts today.\n\n7\n00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,280\nI know we've spent a couple episodes\nnow covering user accounts,\n\n8\n00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,720\ntheir creation, and\nsome of those settings,\n\n9\n00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,570\nsome of the different ways we get\na multiple accounts on a system.\n\n10\n00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,461\nToday we're gonna focus on security,\nall right?\n\n11\n00:00:57,461 --> 00:01:01,541\nSecuring our user accounts to make sure\nthat our data is safe in the event that\n\n12\n00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,086\nbad things happen, right?\n\n13\n00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:05,478\nAnd that bad thing,\nit could be something really bad,\n\n14\n00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:08,295\nlike a hacker getting into your system and\naccessing your data.\n\n15\n00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:11,586\nIt could be something much less bad,\nlike you just lost your laptop,\n\n16\n00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:13,550\ndon't know where it is, right?\n\n17\n00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,520\nThese are the things that we need\nto take proper precautions on to\n\n18\n00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,052\nsecure the system.\n\n19\n00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:22,930\nI wanna start off by talking\nabout firmware passwords on Macs.\n\n20\n00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,930\nEvery Mac supports a firmware password and\nvery few people make use of them.\n\n21\n00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,090\nAnd so I wanna make sure we highlight\nthat and get a good understanding of it.\n\n22\n00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,870\nFirst off, let me explain what our\nproblem is, what problem a firmware\n\n23\n00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,070\npassword fixes, and then we'll talk\nabout how the firmware password works.\n\n24\n00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,650\nThe problem we have is when you set up\na new Mac, you create a user account, and\n\n25\n00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,360\nthat user account has a password, and\nif somebody wants to log in as you\n\n26\n00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,880\nthey've gotta know that username and\npassword, right?\n\n27\n00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,080\nWell, not necessarily.\n\n28\n00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,100\nEvery Mac has a set of utilities\nthat are built into it.\n\n29\n00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,320\nYou can boot from recovery.\n\n30\n00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,330\nWhen you boot from recovery you have the\noption in there to go and reset passwords.\n\n31\n00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,690\nIf you've forgotten a password for an\nadministrator account, you can reset it.\n\n32\n00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,120\nAnd once you're logged\nin as an administrator,\n\n33\n00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,670\nyou can reset passwords for\nother users pretty easily.\n\n34\n00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,670\nSo those passwords are only good\nsecurity in terms of network access.\n\n35\n00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,070\nIf somebody has physical\naccess to your machine\n\n36\n00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,950\nthey can use the Mac's built-in recovery\nto pop the password and get in, right?\n\n37\n00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,490\nSo a password is not enough\n\n38\n00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,570\nif you can't guarantee the physical\nsecurity of your laptop.\n\n39\n00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:31,010\nNow for my computer at home,\nI don't use a firmware password, right?\n\n40\n00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,520\nBecause it's in my home.\n\n41\n00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,210\nIt's locked.\n\n42\n00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,470\nIf somebody wants to get in,\nthey've got to break into my house.\n\n43\n00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,860\nAnd that will probably set off an alarm or\nmy little dog will bark, or\n\n44\n00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,720\nsomething, right?\n\n45\n00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,330\nAnd stop that.\n\n46\n00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,520\nI've got extra levels of security there.\n\n47\n00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,340\nBut on my laptop, what if I leave\nmy laptop at the airport, right?\n\n48\n00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,370\nThis travels with me.\n\n49\n00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,020\nI take it around places.\n\n50\n00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,600\nI can't guarantee the physical\nsecurity of this laptop.\n\n51\n00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,960\nAnd so if I wanna prevent somebody\nfrom booting to recovery or\n\n52\n00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,205\nbooting from some other media, well,\nI need to take an extra precaution.\n\n53\n00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:04,135\nAnd that extra precaution is\nwhat's called a firmware password.\n\n54\n00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:06,945\nA firmware password is a password\nthat's set on the Mac,\n\n55\n00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:11,120\nthat kicks in whenever somebody tries\nto bypass the normal boot order.\n\n56\n00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,090\nWhen you do a normal boot,\nwhen you just boot up Mac OS,\n\n57\n00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,860\nit boots like normal even if\nyou have a firmware password.\n\n58\n00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,390\nBut if somebody boots while\nholding down the Alt key so\n\n59\n00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,410\nthey can pick which hard\ndrive to boot from, or\n\n60\n00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,810\nif they boot up while holding Cmd+R,\nright, to boot to recovery.\n\n61\n00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,320\nWhen they do those things it'll prompt for\nthe firmware password.\n\n62\n00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,850\nAnd if they don't know that password\nthey won't be able to get in, right?\n\n63\n00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,378\nNow the firmware password, one thing I\ndo wanna mention, on older Macs, Macs\n\n64\n00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:44,420\nthat were made, usually it's like 2000 oh,\nsorry, oh shoot, when's the cut off?\n\n65\n00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,232\nIt's like 2011 and earlier,\nseveral years ago.\n\n66\n00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:52,810\nOlder Macs, there were ways to reset\nthe firmware password if you forgot it.\n\n67\n00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,840\nOn newer Macs,\nones made in the last four years or\n\n68\n00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,280\nso, there is no way to reset the firmware\npassword aside from taking the laptop\n\n69\n00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,260\ndown to an Apple store and\nshowing that you have ownership of it.\n\n70\n00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,740\nSo the firmware passwords are far more\nsecure today than they used to be.\n\n71\n00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,920\nYou'll hear some people say all\nfirmware passwords are a joke.\n\n72\n00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,000\nAll you have to do is swap\nthe memory chips around.\n\n73\n00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,795\nIf you move the RAM chips around and\nthen reset the PRAM, off you go.\n\n74\n00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:17,380\nThe firmware password's gone.\n\n75\n00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:17,940\nWell, they're right.\n\n76\n00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,640\nThat used to work.\n\n77\n00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,000\nThat worked on the older Macs.\n\n78\n00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,700\nThat doesn't work on the newer ones.\n\n79\n00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,560\nSo on the exam, if they ask a question\nabout how do you reset a firmware\n\n80\n00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,480\npassword, the answer is you don't.\n\n81\n00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,350\nYou can't.\nThere is no way the end user can do it.\n\n82\n00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,090\nYou have to take it down to the Apple\nstore and have them do it, all right?\n\n83\n00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,460\nSetting a firmware password is not hard,\nit's just most people don't do this.\n\n84\n00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,530\nTo set a firmware password you just have\nto reboot your laptop into recovery.\n\n85\n00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,250\nI keep saying laptop,\nthis works on a desktop too.\n\n86\n00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,610\nI just don't normally assign it on\na desktop because you usually have\n\n87\n00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,840\nphysically security there.\n\n88\n00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,900\nSo, laptops is where we normally see it.\n\n89\n00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,830\nYou boot your device up into recovery.\n\n90\n00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,440\nNow, you guys know, I share my\nlaptop screen out for the show here,\n\n91\n00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,300\nall the time.\n\n92\n00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,080\nAnd the normal method that I use\ndoesn't work inside of recovery.\n\n93\n00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,290\nSo, I've got my trusty laptop turned over\nhere so we can see it from the sky cam.\n\n94\n00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,330\nAnd basically, what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna set my firmware password.\n\n95\n00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,780\nAnd setting a firmware\npassword is pretty easy.\n\n96\n00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,480\nStep one is you need\nto boot into recovery.\n\n97\n00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,610\nSo when you boot your laptop up, or\nyour desktop, you basically hold Cmd+R\n\n98\n00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,950\non your keyboard and then press\npower while you're holding Cmd+R.\n\n99\n00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,628\nAs soon as you see the apple\non the screen you can let go.\n\n100\n00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:28,397\nNow, I've already booted mine into\nrecovery here because I had to\n\n101\n00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:32,130\nuse Internet recovery and I didn't want us\nto wait on the show for that to happen.\n\n102\n00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,003\nSo just holding on Cmd+R while you\ndo it will bring up this screen.\n\n103\n00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,440\nAnd you'll see your basic options and\nwe seen these in other shows, right?\n\n104\n00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,980\nThe restore from time machine,\nreinstall LSX, getting help online,\n\n105\n00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,175\nthose different options.\n\n106\n00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:48,345\nBut if we go up into our menu\nup here under utilities you'll\n\n107\n00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:49,595\nfind the firmware password.\n\n108\n00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:52,725\nAnd it's in the firmware password\nutility that we can come in and set it.\n\n109\n00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:57,000\nAnd the Apple white on grey is kinda\nwashing out there on the screen so\n\n110\n00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,865\nit's hard to see, but it is basically\nsaying password protection is off.\n\n111\n00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:02,753\nAnd I can turn that on.\n\n112\n00:06:02,753 --> 00:06:04,795\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nturn that password protection on.\n\n113\n00:06:04,795 --> 00:06:08,250\nAnd all you do is assign a password.\n\n114\n00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,690\nSo I'll get in here and I'll assign it.\n\n115\n00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,260\nNow I'm gonna take care to make sure\nthat I actually typed it right.\n\n116\n00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,463\nBecause if I didn't get it right,\n\n117\n00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:16,628\nI'm gonna have to take it from\nthe Apple store to get it reset.\n\n118\n00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:18,338\nAnd I don't know about you guys but for\n\n119\n00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:20,730\nme the nearest Apple store\nis about two hours away.\n\n120\n00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,253\nSo I don't want to do that.\n\n121\n00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:24,600\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit Set the Password.\n\n122\n00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,610\nAnd now I've got a recovery password.\n\n123\n00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,320\nNow, I'm sorry not a recovery,\na firmware password.\n\n124\n00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,210\nNow the firmware password is going to\ncome up anytime I boot my system in\n\n125\n00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,950\na non-standard way.\n\n126\n00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,520\nSo for example if I just go\nup here to my Apple menu and\n\n127\n00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,120\nI choose to restart,\nright, it's gonna reboot.\n\n128\n00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,050\nAnd as it goes to boot up it's\ngoing to see my Yosemite partition.\n\n129\n00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,610\nAnd it's gonna boot off of that.\n\n130\n00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,240\nAnd off we go.\n\n131\n00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,090\nSo here my system goes booting up.\n\n132\n00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,540\nI get my Apple menu.\n\n133\n00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,785\nAnd my little progress bar of progress.\n\n134\n00:06:55,785 --> 00:07:00,390\n[LAUGH] I'm sure it has an official\nartsy Apple name but I don't know it.\n\n135\n00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,630\nAll right, so notice how I booted\nup to my Yosemite install and\n\n136\n00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,850\nit didn't prompt me for\na firmware password.\n\n137\n00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,100\nThis is a normal boot.\n\n138\n00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,210\nAnd on a normal boot,\n\n139\n00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,360\nI would have to provide my user\npassword right there, okay?\n\n140\n00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,410\nWell, if somebody doesn't know my\nuser password, they can't get in.\n\n141\n00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,460\nBut the physical attack is where they say,\nwell I don't know the password.\n\n142\n00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,020\nLet me shut it down.\n\n143\n00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,510\nAnd I'll boot into recovery and\n\n144\n00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,120\nwhen I boot into recovery,\nI can reset that password, right?\n\n145\n00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,350\nSo they go ahead and\nshut the machine down, like that, and\n\n146\n00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,000\nthey boot into recovery.\n\n147\n00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,246\nNow I'm gonna try and do this here and\ntry to disrupt this as little as possible.\n\n148\n00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:36,400\nI'm gonna hold Cmd+R on my keyboard.\n\n149\n00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,988\nI've got my laptop keyboard is tipped\nup here, so I'm gonna do Cmd+R.\n\n150\n00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:44,836\nAnd I'm gonna hold that power button for\na second and turn the laptop on.\n\n151\n00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:48,945\nAnd as it starts to boot, I'm just gonna\nwait until I see that Apple logo and\n\n152\n00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:51,045\nI'm holding Cmd+R this whole time.\n\n153\n00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:55,383\nAnd notice instead of getting the little\nApple logo that I would normally get,\n\n154\n00:07:55,383 --> 00:07:57,958\nI get this lock mechanism right here,\nright?\n\n155\n00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,042\nThis is the firmware password.\n\n156\n00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:05,042\nI've tried to do a non standard boot, and\nso now I've got to provide a password.\n\n157\n00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:08,785\nAnd if I I know it, great, if I don't,\nif I type in something wrong,\n\n158\n00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:10,720\nit doesn't let me in, right?\n\n159\n00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,250\nI've now prevented that\nphysical access to the machine.\n\n160\n00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,130\nAnd if I come in here and\n\n161\n00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,190\nprovide the right password,\nnow we'll do my nonstandard boot.\n\n162\n00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,602\nAnd it will boot up and there it goes\nstarting to launch internetwork recovery.\n\n163\n00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,710\nAll right, internetwork recovery\nis just going out to Apple and\n\n164\n00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,910\ngetting network recovery set of files\nto be able to boot and go into.\n\n165\n00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,740\nSo that's an example\nthere using the recovery.\n\n166\n00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,750\nIf somebody gets into recovery,\nthey can reset my password.\n\n167\n00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,450\nBut it also applies for\nother boot sources,\n\n168\n00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,410\nlike if I want to boot off a CD or\nmy superdrive,\n\n169\n00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,430\nIf I wanted to boot off of another\npartition, I would get the same thing.\n\n170\n00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,790\nI'll turn this off, I don't actually\nneed to boot into recovery here.\n\n171\n00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,530\nI'll turn this off and\nthen when I boot up this time,\n\n172\n00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,740\nI'm just gonna hold down\nthe option key on my keyboard.\n\n173\n00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,130\nSo I'm gonna reach over here and\nhold option and hit my power button.\n\n174\n00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,590\nNow while holding option, that brings\nup the boot selection menu and the boot\n\n175\n00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,840\nselection menu will let me pick what\nhard drive I want to boot from, right?\n\n176\n00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,660\nSo I am just holding it down and\n\n177\n00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,815\ninstead of getting the boot selection\nmenu, I get my line lock again.\n\n178\n00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,645\nSo that lock pops right back up.\n\n179\n00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:14,425\nI can provide that password and\n\n180\n00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:17,655\nnow it'll take me to my boot selection\nscreen and from here I can pick.\n\n181\n00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:20,395\nAnd you'll see I've got my\nMacintosh hard drive right here.\n\n182\n00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:23,295\nI've got my recovery right there and\n\n183\n00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:27,845\nI've got my Windows drive because I've\ngot a boot camp partition on here.\n\n184\n00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:30,415\nAnd so I can come through and\npick which ever one it was I wanted.\n\n185\n00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:33,240\nI'll go to recovery, and\nthen it'll boot to that.\n\n186\n00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,440\nAnd notice instead of doing\nthe internet recovery here,\n\n187\n00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,440\nit's actually booting off of\nthe local drive recovery this time.\n\n188\n00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,210\nAnd apparently going pretty slow there.\n\n189\n00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,820\nBut it'll churn along and do it.\n\n190\n00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,330\nSo that's what a firmware password does.\n\n191\n00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,640\nThe firmware password\nprevents physical access.\n\n192\n00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,570\nPeople with physical access from\nbypassing your password, and\n\n193\n00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,440\nthat's an important thing.\n\n194\n00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,790\nOnce you've got it set and done,\n\n195\n00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,380\nonce everything's in place,\nyou pretty much leave it.\n\n196\n00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,630\nAnd most people will never see\nthat password again, right?\n\n197\n00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,480\nBecause you'll boot your computer up and\nyou'll do a standard boot, and\n\n198\n00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,130\nwhen you do a standard boot,\nyou don't see the password.\n\n199\n00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,610\nBut if you need to go and\nboot from another drive or whatever,\n\n200\n00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,390\nyou'll get prompted.\n\n201\n00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,590\nAnd if you decide at some point that\nyou don't want that password anymore,\n\n202\n00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,720\nmaybe you're going to be\nselling the laptop or\n\n203\n00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,510\nyou just don't need it anymore,\nthis one stays at the office.\n\n204\n00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,550\nWell, you can boot to recover and\nyou can turn off that password.\n\n205\n00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,170\nAnd to turn it off,\nwe just boot to recovery.\n\n206\n00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,630\nWe go right back up to our utilities and\nour firmware password utility.\n\n207\n00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,410\nThen right in here, we'll see our options.\n\n208\n00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,790\nAgain, it's a little washed out and\nhard to read.\n\n209\n00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,170\nThere's not much I can do about it,\ncause it's white on gray.\n\n210\n00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,040\nThere's two buttons here,\none of them says change the password, so\n\n211\n00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,870\nI could change it to a different\npassword if I wanted.\n\n212\n00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,000\nAnd the other one is turn off firmware\npassword and that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n213\n00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,080\nI'm gonna turn that password off.\n\n214\n00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,290\nAnd it just asks me to\nprovide what the password is.\n\n215\n00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,760\nI'll punch that in there and then I'll\nturn the password off, all right.\n\n216\n00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,050\nSo that's gonna shut it off and\nnow I won't have a password on it anymore.\n\n217\n00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,420\nSo if I shut my system down, It's\nalways a good idea to test this, right?\n\n218\n00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:05,980\nI'll shut it down.\n\n219\n00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,030\nI'm gonna hold that option key again and\nhit power to go and boot it up.\n\n220\n00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,890\nAnd this time, it should take me right to\nmy drive selector without prompting for\n\n221\n00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,870\nthat password.\n\n222\n00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,350\nSo here we go.\n\n223\n00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,280\nAnd sure enough, I get my selection, I\ncan pick between my different drives, and\n\n224\n00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,724\nit didn't prompt, so\nthat' password and all.\n\n225\n00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,020\nSo that's a firmware password and\n\n226\n00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,280\nit's a great thing if you can't guarantee\nthe physical security of your laptop.\n\n227\n00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,320\nWe are going to talk about a few other\nthings like File Vault that're great for\n\n228\n00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,710\nphysical security too, but\n\n229\n00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,250\nas far as firmware passwords\nare concerned, that's about it.\n\n230\n00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,960\nAll right, well this is a pretty good\nspot for us to stop for this segment, and\n\n231\n00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,700\nit'll give me a chance to put\nmy laptop back to normal so\n\n232\n00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,150\nwe can see it like we normally do.\n\n233\n00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,210\nAny time we actually show the screen,\n\n234\n00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,870\nit's hard with all the studio\nlights to get that to show up well.\n\n235\n00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,840\nSo we normally share screens\na completely different way.\n\n236\n00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,160\nSo I'll flip back to\nthat during the break.\n\n237\n00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,665\nBut stay tuned, because after the break\nwe've got more user account security\n\n238\n00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:03,322\ntechnologies coming up after this.\n\n239\n00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:10,844\n[MUSIC]\n\n240\n00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:12,262\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n241\n00:12:12,262 --> 00:12:15,952\nSo, in this segment, I want to talk\na little bit more about user accounts and\n\n242\n00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:18,050\ntheir associated passwords.\n\n243\n00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,890\nWhen we create a user\naccount on top of our Mac,\n\n244\n00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,180\nit has a password associated with it.\n\n245\n00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,320\nThat's how we get our security.\n\n246\n00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,770\nYou don't have to have a password,\nbut it is certainly a good idea.\n\n247\n00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,910\nAnd if you do have a password, there are\ncertain things we need to be aware of when\n\n248\n00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,630\nit comes to managing\nthe accounts on the system.\n\n249\n00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,700\nThe first thing I want to talk about is,\n\n250\n00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,010\njust how to set that password\nif we don't have one in place.\n\n251\n00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,960\nWe can always go and\nadd one or change one.\n\n252\n00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,960\nAs an administrator on a system,\n\n253\n00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,260\nyou have the ability to reset\nother user's passwords.\n\n254\n00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,980\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n255\n00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,980\nSo here on my system,\nif I go into my system preferences, and\n\n256\n00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,910\nI go into Users and Groups, I can see that\nhere's me, Dan Prezet, I'm an Admin and\n\n257\n00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,910\nI've got another user account here for\nNathan Coplin, he's a standard user.\n\n258\n00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,860\nNow normally, you cannot mess with another\nuser, I cannot click on their user account\n\n259\n00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,690\nor anything like that, but if I unlock\nthat screen that will show that I am\n\n260\n00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:13,670\nan admin and now I can select\nsomeone like selecting Nate.\n\n261\n00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,500\nAnd I can hit, reset password.\n\n262\n00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,570\nSo if Nate says, man I forgot my password.\n\n263\n00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,710\nWell, I'm an administrator.\n\n264\n00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,210\nI can just go in and reset it.\n\n265\n00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,950\nAnd I can change it to\na password that I do know.\n\n266\n00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,230\nSo I can punch in that\npassword right here.\n\n267\n00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,200\nAnd now I know what his password is,\nand it's been reset.\n\n268\n00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,980\nHe can log in and he can then change his\npassword to whatever he wants, all right.\n\n269\n00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,810\nSo, for a standard user, or even another\nadmin, as long as you know the password to\n\n270\n00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,410\none admin account, you'll be able to\nget in there and reset their password.\n\n271\n00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,270\nIf you forget your admin password though,\nso like me, I've only got one admin\n\n272\n00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:51,580\naccount, If I forget my password,\nI'm kind of out of luck, aren't I?\n\n273\n00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,780\nWell not completely.\n\n274\n00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,420\nYou can always boot to recovery.\n\n275\n00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,930\nWhen you boot to recovery, you have\noption in there to reset a password and\n\n276\n00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,710\nyou can clear it that way to get back\nin as an administrator, all right.\n\n277\n00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,190\nBut for any other user, we just do it\nright here through users and groups.\n\n278\n00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,220\nTakes care of it right there and\nthey're able to get in.\n\n279\n00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,220\nNow, when I went to reset that user,\na little message popped up.\n\n280\n00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,650\nSo if I take Nate here, and I hit reset\npassword, it's telling me resetting\n\n281\n00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:22,400\nthe account password, doesn't reset\nthe password for the login key chain.\n\n282\n00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,020\nNow what's that all about?\n\n283\n00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,070\nWell in Mac OS, there's a little\nservice that runs in the background,\n\n284\n00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:32,350\nit's the key chain service and it keeps\ntrack of your user credentials for you,\n\n285\n00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,390\nso as you log into things like, well like\nMac OS, or if you log into websites and\n\n286\n00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,720\nother areas instead of storing your\npasswords in the browser cache or\n\n287\n00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,320\nother non secure areas,\n\n288\n00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,750\nApple has a nice secure tucked away area\nwhere your passwords are stored encrypted.\n\n289\n00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,198\nYour credentials are stored encrypted and\nsecurely.\n\n290\n00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:56,140\nWell, that encryption uses your\npassword as its private key.\n\n291\n00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,050\nIf you change your password, your key\nchain still has the old password and\n\n292\n00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,170\nthey don't match anymore.\n\n293\n00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,880\nThat's no big deal if you\nremember the password.\n\n294\n00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,660\nIf you know what it is,\n\n295\n00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,770\nthen the next time you login it will\noffer to update that key chain.\n\n296\n00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,390\nSame password and take care of it for\nyou, no big deal.\n\n297\n00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,350\nBut if you don't remember the password,\n\n298\n00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,880\nthen you've effectively\nlost your keychain, right?\n\n299\n00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,140\nAnd that in and of itself may or\nmay not be a big deal.\n\n300\n00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,570\nSome people don't really make\nuse of this so they don't care.\n\n301\n00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,800\nIf I lose my password and\nI have to get it reset, and\n\n302\n00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,930\nI don't know it,\nthere's no way to reset your\n\n303\n00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,370\nkey chain's password if you don't know\nthe password that's currently on it.\n\n304\n00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,510\nOtherwise, whatever\nmethod was available for\n\n305\n00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,790\nresetting would be a method that hackers\ncould use to get to your password.\n\n306\n00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,540\nThere just is no way, right?\n\n307\n00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,300\nIf you lose your key chain,\nwhat do you lose?\n\n308\n00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,690\nWell you lose all your cache credentials.\n\n309\n00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,659\nCredentials you use to log into\nnetwork servers, websites,\n\n310\n00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:51,583\nother resources that you've\naccessed from Mac in the past.\n\n311\n00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,438\nAnd as long you know those passwords,\nyou can just relogin on them, and\n\n312\n00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:58,792\nyou'll build an all new key\nchain that has that information.\n\n313\n00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,180\nWell, let me show you this keychain\ncuz most people don't even see it,\n\n314\n00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,050\ndon't even realize that it's there.\n\n315\n00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,350\nBut it is running and\nit's kind of in there in the background.\n\n316\n00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,000\nIt's tucked away under your\nsystem utilities folder, but\n\n317\n00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,360\nI normally just do a spotlight search for\nkeychain to pull it up.\n\n318\n00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,560\nAnd you'll see keychain\naccess right there.\n\n319\n00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,490\nI'm gonna bring up keychain access.\n\n320\n00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,060\nAnd what it'll do is it'll launch.\n\n321\n00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,890\nAnd if the password is still\nsynchronized with your account,\n\n322\n00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,180\nit'll just launch right\nup in your keychain.\n\n323\n00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,450\nIt's unlocked.\n\n324\n00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,940\nIf the password is different than\nthe password on your account,\n\n325\n00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,560\nthen it'll have to prompt you for the\nkeychain password and then, you're doing\n\n326\n00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,830\nwhat's called unlocking the keychain,\nopening it up so you can get at the data.\n\n327\n00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,700\nWhat you're really doing is\nproviding the encryption key, so\n\n328\n00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,960\nthat you're able to decrypt it.\n\n329\n00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,440\nSo, unlocking is kinda\nlike decrypting that data.\n\n330\n00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,170\nWhen you look in here,\nyou can see all the stuff that's stored.\n\n331\n00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,273\nNow, this is a pretty fresh and\nclean computer.\n\n332\n00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:51,656\nI haven't even browsed the internet\non it or anything like that.\n\n333\n00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:54,600\nSo, there's not much in my keychain.\n\n334\n00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,250\nYou'll see my log ins, and for my log ins,\n\n335\n00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,040\nit's mostly iMessage stuff,\nmy own Apple identity and that's it.\n\n336\n00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,010\nIf I look at local items, these would be\nthings like websites that I visited that\n\n337\n00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,690\nhave chosen to store their\ncredentials here in the keychain.\n\n338\n00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,460\nAnd then, you've got system and\n\n339\n00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,310\nsystem roots that uses certificates\nthat your system trusts and\n\n340\n00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,990\nthe root certificate providers that Apple\nhas decided to trust on your behalf.\n\n341\n00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,470\nSo, you can see those listed right there,\n\n342\n00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,920\nthe different organizations\nthat are available.\n\n343\n00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,560\nAnd then, beneath that,\nyou see categories.\n\n344\n00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,480\nWe can see just passwords.\n\n345\n00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,270\nBut see some of the other things we\ncan store, things like secure notes.\n\n346\n00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,890\nYou can put your own notes in there.\n\n347\n00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,710\nAnd these aren't necessarily\npasswords to assign.\n\n348\n00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,948\nMaybe, you got something like\nyour bank account number.\n\n349\n00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:37,130\nAnd you wanna store it\non your computer but\n\n350\n00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,180\nyou don't want to store it non securely.\n\n351\n00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,230\nWell, you can put it in your keychain.\n\n352\n00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,420\nIt'll be encrypted.\n\n353\n00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,940\nAnd unless somebody has that password,\n\n354\n00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,620\nthey will not be able to\ndecrypt it to get at it.\n\n355\n00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,500\nThey call it a secure note.\n\n356\n00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,547\nYou've got your own certificates which\nare useful if you're doing things like\n\n357\n00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:52,515\nencrypted email.\n\n358\n00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:55,695\nIf you're doing digitally signed email,\nyou've gotta have certificates for that.\n\n359\n00:17:55,695 --> 00:17:59,895\nYou've got your keys, which are key pairs,\nnot just a single certificate.\n\n360\n00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:02,635\nAnd then, the certificates themselves for\nmy system.\n\n361\n00:18:02,635 --> 00:18:05,515\nAnd so, I see a lot of the root\ncertificates that we trust\n\n362\n00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:06,105\nright through here.\n\n363\n00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:10,620\nAll of this is stored\ninside of the keychain.\n\n364\n00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,120\nNow, most of this happens\nin the background.\n\n365\n00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,950\nPeople don't notice, we don't really\nthink about it, and that's just that.\n\n366\n00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,830\nBut, changes can happen,\nthings can get modified, and\n\n367\n00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,110\nthen the keychain starts\nto become really visible.\n\n368\n00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,430\nNow, personally, I like the keychain.\n\n369\n00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,500\nI like it to be a little\nmore visible on my system.\n\n370\n00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,530\nOne of the things that I missed when\nI came from the Windows world over to\n\n371\n00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:38,420\nMac is it was ingrained in my mind,\nit still is to this day, when I get up and\n\n372\n00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,370\nwalk away from the computer, I would hit\nthe Windows key L on my keyboard and\n\n373\n00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,340\nthat would lock my screen,\nand I'd walk away.\n\n374\n00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,690\nSo, I always locked my\nscreen when I walked away.\n\n375\n00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,140\nWell, in Mac, with the default install,\n\n376\n00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,770\nthere is no keyboard shortcut\nto lock your screen.\n\n377\n00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,220\nSo, you can set a screen saver that\nlocks it after a few minutes or\n\n378\n00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,000\nsomething like that.\n\n379\n00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,070\nBut there is no just keyboard\nshortcut that you can hit.\n\n380\n00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,970\nWell, with the keychain,\n\n381\n00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,620\nyou can add it up to your menu bar\nhere at the top of the screen.\n\n382\n00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,560\nAnd you can add a little keychain\nicon there that will let you quickly\n\n383\n00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,250\nlock your screen.\n\n384\n00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,080\nAnd I like that.\n\n385\n00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,310\nI use that a lot.\n\n386\n00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:16,680\nIf I go back into my keychain and\nI go to keychain access and preferences.\n\n387\n00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,720\nInside of the preferences for\nthe keychain,\n\n388\n00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,110\nyou'll see show keychain\nstatus in menu bar.\n\n389\n00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,770\nAnd when I clicked that,\na little lock appeared up here.\n\n390\n00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,010\nAnd if you look at the lock,\nyou can see that it's unlocked right now.\n\n391\n00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,230\nI provided a valid password.\n\n392\n00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,000\nSo, I'm able to look at\nall of my credentials and\n\n393\n00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,770\ninformation that's stored in here.\n\n394\n00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,350\nSo, I can see all of my different items,\nand what they are.\n\n395\n00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,100\nIt's unlocked.\n\n396\n00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,040\nIf I'm gonna get up and\nwalk away from my computer,\n\n397\n00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,780\nI don't want somebody else to be\nable to sit down and access this,\n\n398\n00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,100\nespecially since my keychain is unlocked\nright now, that'd be really bad.\n\n399\n00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,770\nSo, you can click on that\nlock icon up there and\n\n400\n00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,360\nyou can lock the screen or\nlock the key chain.\n\n401\n00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,910\nIf I lock the key chain,\nit's gonna lock it, so\n\n402\n00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,970\nsee that lock just kind of\nconverted over there and locked.\n\n403\n00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,000\nAnd up top, I can see I've got my little\nlock emblem now shows as a closed lock.\n\n404\n00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,850\nAnd if somebody tries to go\ninto the keychain utility,\n\n405\n00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,570\nit's gonna make sure that they're properly\nauthenticated, they're properly logged in,\n\n406\n00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:24,050\nand if they were to come in here and\ntry and access one of these items.\n\n407\n00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,730\nSee how it prompted me for\nmy password there?\n\n408\n00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,700\nThat's because it's not actually unlocked.\n\n409\n00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,480\nI can see what items are in there but\n\n410\n00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,090\nI can't see the data\nthat's attached to them.\n\n411\n00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,290\nIt's a locked keychain.\n\n412\n00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,170\nBut the feature that I like is now when I\nget up and walk away from my computer I\n\n413\n00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,610\ncan just click on that lock and\nI can hit lock screen.\n\n414\n00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,960\nAnd then, I can walk away, and if somebody\nelse comes up to this computer and\n\n415\n00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,120\ngoes to log in or use it,\nthey won't be able to access it.\n\n416\n00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,290\nMine appears to have not actually locked.\n\n417\n00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,460\nLet me unlock my keychain here.\n\n418\n00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,620\nIt might be because I've got my\nkeychain locked, there we go.\n\n419\n00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,599\nLet's see if it'll let me\nlock my screen now [SOUND].\n\n420\n00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,841\nWell, shoot.\n\n421\n00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:03,050\nI'll tell you what,\nhere, let me flip over.\n\n422\n00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,960\nI'll just do it on my\nregular desktop [LAUGH].\n\n423\n00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,200\nIt's something I use every single day so\nI know it works just fine.\n\n424\n00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,070\nAnd let me just bring this up.\n\n425\n00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,700\nHere we go.\nSo, here's my normal desktop.\n\n426\n00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,420\nThis is what I actually\nwork from during the day.\n\n427\n00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,570\nAnd you'll see my little lock up there,\nand I'll hit that.\n\n428\n00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,570\nAnd I'll hit Lock Screen and\nit just locks my screen.\n\n429\n00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,150\nAnd for you guys, cuz I'm sharing\nmy desktop, it just kind of froze.\n\n430\n00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,900\nWell, that's because it is actually\nlocked here on my own desktop.\n\n431\n00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,700\nSo, it's locked.\n\n432\n00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,150\nAnd there we go, it just went black.\n\n433\n00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,760\nSo, I've got a locked screen.\n\n434\n00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,390\nWhen I walk up to this machine to use it,\nI have to wake it up and\n\n435\n00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,780\nnow it's prompting for that password.\n\n436\n00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,810\nSo, I have quickly locked it and I can\nprovide my password to gain access again.\n\n437\n00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,537\nSo [COUGH], that's one way that we can\nuse the keychain just to quickly lock and\n\n438\n00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,285\nunlock our screen.\n\n439\n00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:50,745\nBut the passwords themselves, those\nare all getting stored in there too and\n\n440\n00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:51,985\nwe can quickly recover those.\n\n441\n00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:56,355\nIf you've ever used services\nlike LastPass or One Password,\n\n442\n00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:59,825\ncompanies like those,\nthe keychain works very similar to that.\n\n443\n00:21:59,825 --> 00:22:02,648\nThey take your passwords, your usernames\nand passwords, they encrypt them and\n\n444\n00:22:02,648 --> 00:22:04,830\nthey store it right there\ninto the locked vault.\n\n445\n00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,170\nThe big difference is a service\nlike LastPass will synchronize that\n\n446\n00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,240\nkeychain between all your machines.\n\n447\n00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,450\nIn Mac OS,\n\n448\n00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:17,800\nthe keychain is local by default unless\nyou attach an iCloud account, an Apple ID.\n\n449\n00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,510\nIf you attach an Apple ID, you can\nchoose to synchronize it with iCloud.\n\n450\n00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,050\nAnd now, your keychain will be\nsynced across all of your Macs,\n\n451\n00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,700\nas well as your iPad and iPhone,\nif you want to go that far.\n\n452\n00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,170\nNot a lot of people do.\n\n453\n00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,870\nSo, different functions in there as\nfar as how that keychain can work.\n\n454\n00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,480\nBut for the most part, it's automatic.\n\n455\n00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,160\nIf I were to fire up a web browser and\ngo to a website and\n\n456\n00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,680\nget logged in, if that website tries\nto store my credentials locally,\n\n457\n00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,010\nthen it will get stored\nright there in the keychain.\n\n458\n00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,860\nSo, let's try this out here.\n\n459\n00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,409\nI'm gonna go to Slashdot.\n\n460\n00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:53,580\nI should've tested this before the show\nbut we'll see if it works here.\n\n461\n00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,710\nSo, if I got to Slashdot and\nI go to log in.\n\n462\n00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,630\nThey're a tech news site.\n\n463\n00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,770\nI've been going to their site for\nyears and years.\n\n464\n00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,970\nAlthough, thanks to password memory\nutilities like Last Pass and the keychain,\n\n465\n00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,970\nI don't know if I actually\nremember my login credentials.\n\n466\n00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,130\nLet's run some tests here.\n\n467\n00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,040\nWe'll see if I can't get my own login.\n\n468\n00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,280\nAnd here, see how it's asking\nif I wanna save my password.\n\n469\n00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,210\nDo I want to save my password?\n\n470\n00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:24,090\nIf I choose to save it, now,\nthe next time I come to this website and\n\n471\n00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:28,020\nlog in,\nI won't have to provide those credentials.\n\n472\n00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,600\nThey're safe and it can log in using them.\n\n473\n00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,800\nBut if I go back to my keychain and\nI look in here.\n\n474\n00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,790\nI can see now,\nunder my login and all items,\n\n475\n00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:46,040\nI've got Safari extension lists,\nSafari forms, Safari session state.\n\n476\n00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,083\nIt started storing data in here.\n\n477\n00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:52,438\nAnd if I look at my local items,\nthere's slashdot.org and my user account,\n\n478\n00:23:52,438 --> 00:23:53,917\nDon Pezet, right there.\n\n479\n00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:57,917\nIt's a web-form password,\nit's been stored right here.\n\n480\n00:23:57,917 --> 00:23:59,375\nI can see my username.\n\n481\n00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,042\nThe password is encrypted.\n\n482\n00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:04,124\nAnd if my Keychain is unlocked,\nI can right click on that and\n\n483\n00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:08,208\nI can copy the password to the clipboard\nand now I can go and paste it somewhere.\n\n484\n00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,690\nMy password is stored right\nthere in that database.\n\n485\n00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,420\nAll right?\n\n486\n00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:16,790\nIf my Keychain is lock though, if its lock\nthen I won't be able to get in there.\n\n487\n00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,290\nAnd access this data.\n\n488\n00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:24,565\nIf I reset my account password,\nmy keychain password is now different.\n\n489\n00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:26,210\nThat's where we start to have problems.\n\n490\n00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,160\nLet me show you that with another account.\n\n491\n00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,040\nIf I go here.\n\n492\n00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,700\nIf I just change my own password,\nI'm logged in.\n\n493\n00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,100\nIt synchronizes all that for me.\n\n494\n00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,350\nRight.\nIt's no big deal.\n\n495\n00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,130\nIf I go to system preferences,\nand users and groups, and\n\n496\n00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,140\nI take my account and\nI hit change password.\n\n497\n00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,470\nI can provide my old password, which is\nhow it will be able to unlock things, and\n\n498\n00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,640\nI can provide my new password,\nlike that, and I'll change those values.\n\n499\n00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,530\nSo now I just changed my password.\n\n500\n00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,360\nOkay.\n\n501\n00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,160\nNotice in the background,\nmy key chain is still unlocked.\n\n502\n00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,430\nIf I lock my Keychain, so\nI'm just gonna lock it right there.\n\n503\n00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,900\nThen I will unlock my Keychain.\n\n504\n00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,940\nIt's asking for the password.\n\n505\n00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:13,060\nIf I provide my new\npassword I get an error.\n\n506\n00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,140\nKeychain access wants\nto use login Keychain,\n\n507\n00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,030\nplease enter the Keychain password.\n\n508\n00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,790\nI just did.\n\n509\n00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,410\nI just punched in my new password.\n\n510\n00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,900\nIt's not recognizing it.\n\n511\n00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,380\nIf I punch in my old password,\nthe key chain unlocks, all right?\n\n512\n00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,310\nThe next time I log out and\nlog back in, it'll update the key chain\n\n513\n00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:35,080\nto use that same password, use that\nsame credential, and then we'll be fine.\n\n514\n00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,930\nBut for right now, there's that disparity.\n\n515\n00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,860\nAnd that's where we get a real problem\nwhen we reset somebody else's password.\n\n516\n00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,000\nBecause if they can't remember that key\nchain password, if they don't know what it\n\n517\n00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,630\nis, then they can't possibly recover that,\nand so they lose it.\n\n518\n00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,790\nAnd what happens is Mac OS will make\na copy of the key chain, you don't know\n\n519\n00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,790\nthe password, but it makes a copy just\nin case, maybe you remember one day.\n\n520\n00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,210\nAnd it creates an all new\nkey chain that's just empty.\n\n521\n00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,880\nAnd as you login to websites and stuff,\n\n522\n00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,880\nit will rebuild that key chain in there,\nall right?\n\n523\n00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,760\nSo be aware of that.\n\n524\n00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,990\nWhen we go into system preferences and\nwe reset some user's passwords.\n\n525\n00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,260\nSo I'll just go to users and groups.\n\n526\n00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,720\nAnd I'll take Nate.\n\n527\n00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,170\nLet me unlock that real quick.\n\n528\n00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,450\nSo I'll take Nate here and\nI'll just hit reset password for him.\n\n529\n00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,100\nIt gives me that warning\nabout the keychain.\n\n530\n00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,300\nAnd I'm going to punch\nin his new password.\n\n531\n00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,540\nRight, there's his new password.\n\n532\n00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,900\nI'll change that.\n\n533\n00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,210\nThere we go.\n\n534\n00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,072\nAnd now if I switch\nover to Nate's account,\n\n535\n00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:34,840\nI'll login with that nice new password.\n\n536\n00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,710\nThere I go to login.\n\n537\n00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,180\nHe knows his new password cuz I reset it.\n\n538\n00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,890\nAnd then, here's the message I get.\n\n539\n00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,660\nThe system was unable to\nunlock your login key chain.\n\n540\n00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,410\nThe passwords don't match anymore.\n\n541\n00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,150\nI've got some choices.\n\n542\n00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,560\nI can continue to login which is\ngonna create an all new key chain and\n\n543\n00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,810\nthat's it, right?\n\n544\n00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,850\nWell actually it will leave the keychain\nlocked and it wont do anything.\n\n545\n00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,280\nIf I choose create a new key chain\nthat will create a new one and\n\n546\n00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,580\nthen I'll log in and I'll use it but\n\n547\n00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,270\nmy keychain will be empty and\nif I choose update key chain password.\n\n548\n00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:13,860\nHere's my chance, if I remember what my\nold password was, I can punch it in and\n\n549\n00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,580\nit will change it to the new one, it will\nupdate the password to my new password.\n\n550\n00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,000\nIt will decrypt the database\nusing the old password and\n\n551\n00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,850\nthen it will re encrypt the database\nusing the new password.\n\n552\n00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,050\nIt's simple if you happen\nto know the password.\n\n553\n00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:30,080\nBut if you don't, your only choice\nis to create a new keychain.\n\n554\n00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,290\nIt will save your old keychain,\njust put it in a little backup file.\n\n555\n00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,240\nAnd then you'll have a nice new\nempty keychain to build from.\n\n556\n00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,870\nAll right?\n\n557\n00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,500\nBut for Nate, since I do know the old one,\nI can go to update keychain password.\n\n558\n00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,620\nAnd it wants me to punch in the password\nfor the Keychain the old password.\n\n559\n00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,530\nAnd when I say okay it's gonna update it\n\n560\n00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,080\nto match the password that I\nused to login to the system.\n\n561\n00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,150\nThe new password.\n\n562\n00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:52,780\nAll right?\n\n563\n00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,080\nNow it's in and there we go.\n\n564\n00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,340\nAll right.\n\n565\n00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,155\nSo be aware of that.\n\n566\n00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:58,105\nAt the key chain, it's not very evident.\n\n567\n00:27:58,105 --> 00:28:01,385\nIt runs in the background,\nmost users don't even know it's there.\n\n568\n00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:03,485\nIt's really visible to me,\nbecause I added it to my menu bar.\n\n569\n00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:04,855\nBut that's not the default, right?\n\n570\n00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:07,525\nSo, most people aren't even\naware of that key chain access.\n\n571\n00:28:07,525 --> 00:28:11,165\nBut if you reset somebody's password,\nyou've got to deal with the key chain.\n\n572\n00:28:11,165 --> 00:28:14,335\nEither by creating an all new one,\nor updating the password and\n\n573\n00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:15,455\nit's reflecting your new password.\n\n574\n00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,600\nAll right, let's see, what else is\nthere worth mentioning on the keychain?\n\n575\n00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,960\nI think that's about it for the key chain.\n\n576\n00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,290\nI do have some other settings that I\nneed to talk about centering around\n\n577\n00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,820\nApple ID and stuff, but this is a pretty\ngood spot to stop and take a break.\n\n578\n00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,190\nSo why don't we pause here.\n\n579\n00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,240\nWhen we get back we're\ngonna dive into Apple IDs.\n\n580\n00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,790\nI do need to talk about FileVault, and\niCloud a few other different things there.\n\n581\n00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,951\nSo stay tuned and we'll tackle\nall that in the upcoming segment.\n\n582\n00:28:41,951 --> 00:28:43,192\nSo we'll be back in just a few.\n\n583\n00:28:43,192 --> 00:28:49,733\n[MUSIC]\n\n584\n00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:51,358\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n585\n00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:56,880\nSo in the last segment we got a chance to\nsee how to set and reset user passwords.\n\n586\n00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,640\nWe got our first glimpse of that.\n\n587\n00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,660\nWe talked about the key chain.\n\n588\n00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,640\nI want to go a little bit further\non talking about passwords and\n\n589\n00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,180\na few other little caveats that\nmight show up on the exam.\n\n590\n00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,920\nThere are a few settings that we can\nadjust when it comes to passwords.\n\n591\n00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,300\nLet me show you some of them.\n\n592\n00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,720\nIf we jump into our system\npreferences screen.\n\n593\n00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,020\nI've been going under this users and\ngroups preference pane,\n\n594\n00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,640\nis where I've been going all this time.\n\n595\n00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,280\nBut you notice that there is security and\nprivacy up top also.\n\n596\n00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,970\nAnd if we go to security and privacy.\n\n597\n00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,800\nWe'll see some other settings\nthat apply to passwords.\n\n598\n00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,310\nNotice for example these right here,\n\n599\n00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:32,092\nrequire password five minutes after\nsleep or screen saver begins.\n\n600\n00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:33,230\nAll right?\n\n601\n00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,290\nIf a computer goes to sleep, if somebody\nwalks away from the computer and\n\n602\n00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,130\nthey leave themselves logged in.\n\n603\n00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,320\nIf the computer goes to sleep and\n\n604\n00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,240\nsomebody wakes it up,\nit's going to prompt for a password.\n\n605\n00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,430\nAssuming its been asleep for\nfive minutes or longer, right?\n\n606\n00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,370\nWe can tailor that however we want.\n\n607\n00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,410\nWe can turn that off, we can leave it on.\n\n608\n00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,940\nIt's up to us.\n\n609\n00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,940\nWe also have other options in here like\nshow up message when the screen is locked.\n\n610\n00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,350\nIf we've got screen locking enabled.\n\n611\n00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,940\nDisable automatic login.\n\n612\n00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,040\nAnd that's checked by default,\nbecause we're requiring that password.\n\n613\n00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,180\nIf we turn that off,\nthen these options will light up and\n\n614\n00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,620\nwe'll be able to choose them.\n\n615\n00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,670\nAnd then you've got whether\napps are allowed to run,\n\n616\n00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,040\neven if you're not logged in.\n\n617\n00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,510\nAnd that's important,\nwe'll see some of these\n\n618\n00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:20,550\nlater when we talk about controlling\nwhat apps people are allowed to run.\n\n619\n00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,220\nAre they allowed to run apps just\nfrom the App Store or from anywhere?\n\n620\n00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,060\nIt's up to you how you want to set that.\n\n621\n00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,470\nBut we can go in and kinda tweak it,\nadjust these settings to meet the need.\n\n622\n00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,650\nBut the main one is like\nrequire a password, and\n\n623\n00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,950\neven changing the password for\nthe user right there.\n\n624\n00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,910\nSo those are some additional\npassword settings that we've got.\n\n625\n00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,930\nAnother key one that Apple is\npushing really hard in Yosemite\n\n626\n00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,010\nis Apple ID integration.\n\n627\n00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,230\nDuring the installation episodes,\n\n628\n00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:50,580\nyou guys saw it pestered me multiple\ntimes during the install on first login.\n\n629\n00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,770\nEvery time I create a new user it wants\nto link them to an Apple ID, right?\n\n630\n00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,420\nAnd there's a few different reasons for\nthat.\n\n631\n00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,050\nThe main reason is if you\nlink to the Apple ID you\n\n632\n00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,100\ncan synchronize settings across devices.\n\n633\n00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,230\nSo if you have more than one Mac,\nif you have an iPhone, an iPad.\n\n634\n00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,830\nYou can have settings that\nare shared between them,\n\n635\n00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,270\nand when you buy a new device\nthey'll carry along the settings.\n\n636\n00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,430\nBut there are some other advantages too.\n\n637\n00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,170\nFor example, if you forget\nthe password on your own computer\n\n638\n00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,590\nyou can use the Apple ID password\nreset to unlock your account.\n\n639\n00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:23,800\nWhen you attach to an Apple ID you can\nlogin to the computer using your Apple ID.\n\n640\n00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,770\nNow you've got a common\npassword between them, right?\n\n641\n00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,590\nSo it does make life\na little easier there too.\n\n642\n00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,910\nWell, I've dodged it up until now,\nbut let's take a look at that.\n\n643\n00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,680\nWhat it's like when we attach an Apple TV.\n\n644\n00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,540\nWell, if I go back to my System\nPreferences, and I got into users and\n\n645\n00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,070\ngroups and I take a user like me, right?\n\n646\n00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,570\nSo here's my account and\n\n647\n00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:48,280\nas I look at my settings here I got change\npassword, I got a context card right.\n\n648\n00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,000\nLet me unlock this so\nI can get all of my options.\n\n649\n00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,042\nAnd I'm still logging\nwith a local password.\n\n650\n00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:57,125\nA password that I assign\nright here on this machine.\n\n651\n00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:01,510\nIf I go to change my password, well,\nhere's my old password, my new password,\n\n652\n00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,876\nand that's it, right?\n\n653\n00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:07,900\nI don't get anything too crazy there just\nbecause it's a local account, right?\n\n654\n00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,950\nWell, if I add my iCloud account,\nI'll see a new option.\n\n655\n00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,740\nThat'll say whether or\n\n656\n00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:17,690\nnot I want to use my iCloud password,\nas my system password too, all right.\n\n657\n00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:22,380\nIf I go back to system preferences and\nI go down here to iCloud, I can create\n\n658\n00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,340\na new Apple ID if I don't have one already\nor I can log in with an existing one.\n\n659\n00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,160\nAnd I've got one just for\nthis show, if I can\n\n660\n00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,280\nremember its password, there we go,\nand we can get logged in.\n\n661\n00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,060\nNow Apple IDs and these iPod accounts\nare free, they don't cost you a time.\n\n662\n00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,260\nSo you can create one and\nget a lot of the advantages.\n\n663\n00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,390\nWhere you have to pay is\nif you want more storage.\n\n664\n00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,950\nYou get a certain amount of storage for\nfree,\n\n665\n00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,390\nI think it's like 5GB or 20GB of storage.\n\n666\n00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,990\nIf you want more, you've got to pay.\n\n667\n00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:54,840\nWith iCloud, there's a lot of free\nservices you get like synchronizing\n\n668\n00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,070\nyour contacts, calendars, and\nall that as well as using Find My Mac.\n\n669\n00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,610\nFind My Mac is really cool.\n\n670\n00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,760\nIf you lose your laptop, and you don't\nknow where it is, you can log in to\n\n671\n00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,140\nthe Apple website and you can do\na quick check to see where it is and\n\n672\n00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,010\nit will try to turn on the GPS and find\nthe device if it can contact it, right?\n\n673\n00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:15,400\nIf the device can't access the Internet\nthen there's no way to reach out and\n\n674\n00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,250\ncontact it.\n\n675\n00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,140\nFor an iPhone and\n\n676\n00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,970\niPad because they have the cellular\ncards in them, well most iPad's,\n\n677\n00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,130\nthen its easy to spot those but for\na laptop you may not have that service.\n\n678\n00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,810\nAll right, well I'm going to turn\noff Find my Mac for right now.\n\n679\n00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:31,380\nBe aware that if you have\nmultiple user accounts,\n\n680\n00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,020\nFind my Mac can only be turned on once for\na laptop.\n\n681\n00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,606\nIt can only be linked to one Apple ID,\nso if I link that to mine and\n\n682\n00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:40,669\nI've got Nate on here also,\nhe cannot link it to his.\n\n683\n00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:45,743\nWe can't both do Find my\nMac to the same system.\n\n684\n00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:47,879\nAll right, so we are going to go ahead and\nturn that on,\n\n685\n00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:50,910\nthat's going to setup iCloud and\nnotice that it's prompting me.\n\n686\n00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,540\nFor my iCloud key chain,\nwe saw that key chain earlier,\n\n687\n00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,950\nthat was stored right\nhere on my own machine.\n\n688\n00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,550\nBut it's gonna create a key chain for\n\n689\n00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,930\nme in iCloud that'll be shared\nacross my machines, and so\n\n690\n00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,370\nit wants me to provide the password for\nthat, and it's the Apple ID password.\n\n691\n00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,420\nSo I'll punch that in.\n\n692\n00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,680\nAnd that's what it's gonna use is that\nprivate key to encrypt the database.\n\n693\n00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,670\nAll right, and now it's asking if\nI wanna upgrade to iCloud Drive.\n\n694\n00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,300\nI'm gonna cancel that for right now.\n\n695\n00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,666\nThat's a new feature in Yosemite that\nwe'll talk about a little later.\n\n696\n00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:25,028\nAll right, it's gonna ask me to\nset an iCloud security code.\n\n697\n00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:28,255\nIf I ever forget my password and\nI have to call Apple support,\n\n698\n00:34:28,255 --> 00:34:32,075\nthey'll want a code and so I can provide\nwhatever I want that code to be.\n\n699\n00:34:37,113 --> 00:34:38,980\nAnd it's gonna make me punch it in again.\n\n700\n00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,000\nThere we go.\n\n701\n00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,530\nAnd I can punch in a phone number if\nI want them to be able to send me\n\n702\n00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,160\ntext messages.\n\n703\n00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,880\nI'm just gonna cancel that for\nright now, there we go.\n\n704\n00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,520\nAll right, so\nnow I've got iCloud set up for my system.\n\n705\n00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,460\nWell, that's gonna change things as\nfar as how my passwords are set.\n\n706\n00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:01,070\nIf I go back to my System Preferences and\nUsers & Groups, and I take my account and\n\n707\n00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:05,050\nI hit Change Password,\nnow it's offering something different.\n\n708\n00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,330\nWhen I came to the screen a moment ago,\n\n709\n00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,740\nit just asked me to put in the old\npassword and new password.\n\n710\n00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,490\nOr my new one, if I'm resetting.\n\n711\n00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,940\nHere though,\nit's offering to change the password,\n\n712\n00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,410\nto go to the old screen or\nto use my iCloud password.\n\n713\n00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,420\nIf I choose that,\nnow it's gonna change my account.\n\n714\n00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,810\nInstead of using this old\npassword that's local only,\n\n715\n00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:29,760\nit'll use my iCloud one and I can log into\nthe computer using that iCloud password.\n\n716\n00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,972\nAnd it'll update my key\nchain to use that too,\n\n717\n00:35:31,972 --> 00:35:36,360\nmy local key chain will get mirrored\nwith the iCloud key chain, right?\n\n718\n00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,090\nThe cool part about this is,\n\n719\n00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,580\nif you get locked out of your machine you\ncan use iCloud's password reset functions.\n\n720\n00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,430\nIf I go back out to my login screen,\nso now that's set, and\n\n721\n00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:50,220\nnotice my username changed\nto my email don1@itpro.tv.\n\n722\n00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,300\nSo it's now linked to iCloud.\n\n723\n00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,790\nIf I go back out to my main login screen,\nso I'm just going to log out.\n\n724\n00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:01,520\nAll right,\nwhen I go back to the login screen,\n\n725\n00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,420\nmy user account shows up\njust like it did before.\n\n726\n00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,470\nThere's Don Pezet, right.\n\n727\n00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,310\nNothing special there, and\nit's asking for a password.\n\n728\n00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:10,130\nIf I type in the wrong password and\n\n729\n00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,210\npress enter,\nwell it's the wrong password, right?\n\n730\n00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,370\nNot too happy about that and\nI can't get in.\n\n731\n00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,990\nAnd if I continue to do\nthe wrong password over and\n\n732\n00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:22,730\nover again, eventually it'll get the hint\nthat I don't know my password, and\n\n733\n00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,460\nit'll prompt me with\nthe ability to go to iCloud.\n\n734\n00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:30,050\nHere it is, this account uses an iCloud\npassword to log in, if you need to change\n\n735\n00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:35,290\nthe password, use another device,\nand go to AppleID.Apple.com.\n\n736\n00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,450\nGo to that website, and\nyou can hange your password right there.\n\n737\n00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,330\nSo it's a different\ntype of password reset.\n\n738\n00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,500\nVersus, if I try to log in as Nate here,\nNate has a local account.\n\n739\n00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,640\nAnd if I take his account,\nand I try to log in,\n\n740\n00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,480\npunch in the wrong password,\nwell, what's it going to do here?\n\n741\n00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,730\nAnd then,\nit's just not gonna log it in, right.\n\n742\n00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,040\nI don't have a website that I can go to.\n\n743\n00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,440\nIt's gonna display a message eventually\n\n744\n00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,680\ntelling me that I can ask\nmy administrator for help.\n\n745\n00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,610\nAnd sooner or later,\nwe'll get that message.\n\n746\n00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:08,200\nBut with iCloud, we can go to\nthat website and we'll see it.\n\n747\n00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,090\nApparently, it's not gonna get.\n\n748\n00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,590\nYou know, I don't think,\nI set a password hint for him.\n\n749\n00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,440\nNormally, it would display\nthe password hint and then,\n\n750\n00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,710\nadd that little message about\nreaching out to the administrator.\n\n751\n00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,960\nSo since I didn't send a hint for him,\n\n752\n00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,020\nI guess it's not even gonna\ndisplay that message.\n\n753\n00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,970\nBut at this point, he can't log in.\n\n754\n00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,110\nIt's a local account, so he'll have\nto ask an administrator to reset it.\n\n755\n00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,080\nIf he is the administrator,\nhe'll have to boot to recovery and fix it.\n\n756\n00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,070\nVersus on my account,\nI can just go to the Apple website.\n\n757\n00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:36,280\nLogin to my Apple ID there, and\nreset my password if I need too,\n\n758\n00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,520\nbut I got to login with my Apple ID.\n\n759\n00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,664\nIf I can't login with my Apple ID,\nif I don't know that password.\n\n760\n00:37:41,664 --> 00:37:44,124\nThen I'm probably going to have to\nget on the phone with Apple, or\n\n761\n00:37:44,124 --> 00:37:46,560\nanswer my security questions,\nput in that pin number, right?\n\n762\n00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,370\nThose other forms of verification,\nhave it text my cell phone a code, right?\n\n763\n00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:55,330\nAll the other different methods that\nare available to recover that password.\n\n764\n00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:58,550\nBecause we're linked to iCloud, so\nthat's the big advantage there.\n\n765\n00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,710\nAll right, the other thing is that my\nkey chain is now linked to this too.\n\n766\n00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,280\nSo I've got not just\nan encrypted key chain but\n\n767\n00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,140\na key chain that is being\nsynchronized via iCloud.\n\n768\n00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,300\nSo if I lose my computer and\nI get an all new one,\n\n769\n00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,620\nthe key chain synchronizes down and\nI've got all my credentials,\n\n770\n00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,250\nmy secure notes and all of my information\nthere, and it's safe and secure.\n\n771\n00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:23,760\nAll right, so\nthat's pretty much it for key chains.\n\n772\n00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,460\nLet's see I talked about password\nresets with Apple IDs, and\n\n773\n00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:31,520\nI talked about iCloud and\nlike the Find my Mac kind of stuff.\n\n774\n00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,640\nThose things, those features that\nare a part of that integration.\n\n775\n00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,600\nI've got a couple last little bits\nthat we've got to hit before we wrap\n\n776\n00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,580\nthis show up.\n\n777\n00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,060\nAnother one I wanna mention are the basic\nprivacy controls for our accounts.\n\n778\n00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,130\nIf we go into our system preferences,\na moment ago,\n\n779\n00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:51,750\nI went under security and privacy,\njust to look at the general tab, but\n\n780\n00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,870\nlet's take a look at this privacy\ntab over here real quick.\n\n781\n00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,460\nUnder the privacy tab there's some\nsettings we can adjust that are kind of\n\n782\n00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,980\nimportant, things like location services.\n\n783\n00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,990\nNow, a lot of these settings\nare global to the system.\n\n784\n00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:07,100\nSo that means, only one setting\nis shared across all the users.\n\n785\n00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,630\nIf I disable location services,\nit disables it for all the users.\n\n786\n00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,998\nThat's why this is greyed out,\n\n787\n00:39:11,998 --> 00:39:14,810\nI've gotta unlock it as\nan administrator to modify it.\n\n788\n00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,630\nA regular user is unable to do that.\n\n789\n00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:23,800\nBecause we might want to have certain\naccess and we've got to authorize.\n\n790\n00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,700\nOh shoot, I forgot.\n\n791\n00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,904\nApple ID.\n\n792\n00:39:26,904 --> 00:39:29,912\nI've gotta remember that I leaked my\nApple ID there, it's a different password.\n\n793\n00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:33,190\nAll right, so now I can turn those\nlocation services on or off.\n\n794\n00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,555\nTypically we want them on because\nthat's what powers Find My Mac.\n\n795\n00:39:36,555 --> 00:39:39,958\nIf I can't locate the Mac,\nthen it's gonna be hard to find it.\n\n796\n00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:42,226\nBut if we're worried\nabout our own privacy,\n\n797\n00:39:42,226 --> 00:39:45,569\nif we don't want our government to\nbe able to track our location and\n\n798\n00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:48,610\nthings of that nature we can\nturn that functionality off.\n\n799\n00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,667\nRight.\nSo I can just disable location services.\n\n800\n00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:53,583\nAnd now I won't be able to do find my Mac,\nright.\n\n801\n00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:56,981\nIf we look at Contacts, Calendars,\nReminders, Accessibility,\n\n802\n00:39:56,981 --> 00:40:00,676\na lot of this stuff here, these\nare just controlling what applications,\n\n803\n00:40:00,676 --> 00:40:03,083\nwhat programs are allowed\nto see my Calendars.\n\n804\n00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,970\nWhat programs are allowed to see\nmy Contacts and my Reminders.\n\n805\n00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,830\nYou might want some Software to see it,\n\n806\n00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,660\nand you might not want\nother Software to see it.\n\n807\n00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,910\nAnd so, you can tailor right here.\n\n808\n00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,970\nThis happens when you\ninstall Third-Party Software.\n\n809\n00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,410\nWe've got our Accessibility settings.\n\n810\n00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,020\nNow this is an important one.\n\n811\n00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,305\nWhen we talk about security.\n\n812\n00:40:20,325 --> 00:40:23,955\nAccessibility functionality,\nthe ability to do like a screen reader to\n\n813\n00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:27,995\nread the text off of the screen\nto do the magnifier and so on.\n\n814\n00:40:27,995 --> 00:40:32,525\nThat requires very low\nlevel access to Mac OS.\n\n815\n00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:34,245\nTo the video drivers for\n\n816\n00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:36,880\nwhat is being output on the screen\nto do the magnification.\n\n817\n00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,900\nTo the actual text being displayed so\nthat we can read it out orally.\n\n818\n00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,000\nIf we wanna be able to do\nthe sticky keys type functionality,\n\n819\n00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,110\nthe ability to control the keyboard.\n\n820\n00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,460\nWell, you want Accessibility\nsoftware to be able to do that.\n\n821\n00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,430\nIf you installed JAWS, you want it\nto be able to do the screen reader,\n\n822\n00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,290\nto be able to read stuff out loud.\n\n823\n00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:00,130\nBut you don't want just any old\nprogram to be able to do that.\n\n824\n00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,540\nIf a program has access to the text on the\nscreen that means they can scrape it and\n\n825\n00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,370\nsend it off to a Third-Party.\n\n826\n00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,100\nSo under Accessibility here,\n\n827\n00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:11,840\nwe have the option to control what\nprograms are allowed to do this.\n\n828\n00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,400\nIf I installed the Jaws Screen Reader,\nI want that here in this list.\n\n829\n00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,350\nI want it allowed to use all of the\nAccessibility functionality because that's\n\n830\n00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,210\nwhat's gonna help me read the screen.\n\n831\n00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:28,240\nBut if I install some video game off\nthe Internet, I probably don't want that\n\n832\n00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,190\nto have accessibility options, because it\ncould be leaking my Personal Data out.\n\n833\n00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,810\nSo We've got that control right here.\n\n834\n00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:37,190\nYou just add and\nremove programs based on your needs.\n\n835\n00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:41,290\nAnd then way back during the original\ninstall of Mac OS it asked me if I wanted\n\n836\n00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,400\nto participate in their diagnostic and\nusage program, and I chose no.\n\n837\n00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,640\nWell, here I can come back and\nchange my mind and go to yes.\n\n838\n00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,530\nOr I could turn it off if it was\nalready on and not participate.\n\n839\n00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,730\nSo I've got that option to change.\n\n840\n00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,480\nSo this is some additional\ninformation here.\n\n841\n00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,773\nNot security in the sense of like,\nlocking down my system, but\n\n842\n00:41:58,773 --> 00:42:02,390\nsecurity in the sense of protecting\nyour own personal information.\n\n843\n00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:06,472\nAll right, and\n\n844\n00:42:06,472 --> 00:42:10,040\nthe last thing that I need to mention\nin this episode is the File Vault.\n\n845\n00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,980\nIf somebody gets a hold of my computer.\n\n846\n00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,150\nIf I lose my laptop.\n\n847\n00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,650\nI leave it in the back of a cab, or on\na train or whatever and somebody gets it.\n\n848\n00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,440\nRight.\n\n849\n00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,450\nThey can't log in.\n\n850\n00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,300\nRight.\nIf they boot the system up,\n\n851\n00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,500\nthey don't know my password\nthey can't log in.\n\n852\n00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,740\nIf they go to recovery, well,\nI set a Firmware Password.\n\n853\n00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,000\nThey can't get in.\n\n854\n00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,180\nWell, if they really want my data,\nthey can take the laptop apart,\n\n855\n00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,400\ntake the hard drive out, and go and\nplug the hard drive into another computer.\n\n856\n00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,250\nAnd when they've plugged\nthe hardwire in on another computer,\n\n857\n00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,700\nthey're not using my Firmware anymore.\n\n858\n00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,760\nThey're not using my Password.\n\n859\n00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,600\nThey're logging in with their\nown Operating System and\n\n860\n00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,250\nnow they can access all of\nmy files on that drive.\n\n861\n00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,000\nIf they take that hard drive out, all of\nour other security goes out the window and\n\n862\n00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,010\nnow they can get at\nthe files on that drive.\n\n863\n00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,530\nThat's a problem.\n\n864\n00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,670\nFileVault fixes that.\n\n865\n00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,350\nAll right.\n\n866\n00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:02,610\nFileVault will encrypt\nthe entire Hard drive.\n\n867\n00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,840\nIt will encrypt it with your security key.\n\n868\n00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,060\nAnd if somebody takes\nthat hard drive out and\n\n869\n00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:13,870\nadds it as another drive in another system\nwell, all they'll see is encrypted data.\n\n870\n00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:17,620\nThis is an extra step,\nan extra level of protection.\n\n871\n00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,970\nIf somebody boots into Recovery,\nthis drive is encrypted.\n\n872\n00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:24,080\nThey'll have to provide a master\npassword to be able to decrypt it.\n\n873\n00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,280\nThis gives us that level of security that\nyou need with something like a laptop,\n\n874\n00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,340\nwhere you don't necessarily have\ncontrol of it all the time.\n\n875\n00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:35,060\nBe aware that there are two\ndifferent version of FileVault.\n\n876\n00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,830\nYou don't see it here in the UI,\nit just says FileVault, but\n\n877\n00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,880\nthis is actually FileVault version 2.\n\n878\n00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:45,040\nFileVault version 1, I believe the last\nMac OS to support it was 10.6,\n\n879\n00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,440\nso lion, and back under 10.6, FileVault\nwould encrypt just your user folder.\n\n880\n00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,990\nSo if you browsed under the hard drive and\ninto the users folder and like, Don Pezet.\n\n881\n00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,440\nIt would encrypt just that folder.\n\n882\n00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,585\nThe whole rest of\nthe hard drive would not.\n\n883\n00:43:58,585 --> 00:43:59,795\nNot be encrypted, right?\n\n884\n00:43:59,795 --> 00:44:01,795\nNow there's obvious problems there.\n\n885\n00:44:01,795 --> 00:44:05,215\nThe biggest problem being what if you\nstore data outside of your user folder,\n\n886\n00:44:05,215 --> 00:44:07,085\nit's not going to be encrypted.\n\n887\n00:44:07,085 --> 00:44:10,757\nSo Apple replaced that\nwith FileVault Version 2.\n\n888\n00:44:10,757 --> 00:44:15,830\nAnd FileVault Version 2 will\nencrypt the entire hard drive.\n\n889\n00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:16,450\nOkay.\n\n890\n00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:17,250\nNow when we do that,\n\n891\n00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,750\nwhen we encrypt the whole hard drive,\nif we're sharing this computer between\n\n892\n00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:25,890\nmultiple user accounts everybody's being\nencrypted with the same private key.\n\n893\n00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:27,780\nSo we have what's called\na master password.\n\n894\n00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,390\nThe Master Password for\ndecrypting the hard drive.\n\n895\n00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:32,830\nAnd then you still have your user\npasswords to be able to log in and\n\n896\n00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:33,990\naccess data.\n\n897\n00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,810\nBut at the end of the day\nthe entire drive is encrypted.\n\n898\n00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,440\nIf somebody rips that hard drive out and\n\n899\n00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,510\nplugs it in on another system, it's\nencrypted, they cant' get at the data.\n\n900\n00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,600\nIf you have a laptop,\nit's a good idea to turn FileVault on.\n\n901\n00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,700\nNow one of the questions I\nget is what if I have a SSD,\n\n902\n00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,000\nright, a Solid State Digital Drive.\n\n903\n00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,250\nIf you have an SSD,\nthe original SSD's had lifetime problems.\n\n904\n00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:59,370\nThe more you wrote to them, the sooner\nthey'd fail and people would get one year,\n\n905\n00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:00,820\nmaybe two years out of them.\n\n906\n00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:04,610\nWell if you pay a lot of money for an SSD,\nyou want it to last as long as possible.\n\n907\n00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:08,190\nAnd encryption schemes can be\nnotoriously hard on discs.\n\n908\n00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:12,350\nWell Apple's come a long way\nsince then and so have SSDs.\n\n909\n00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,070\nSo that now you can safely\nturn on FileVault and\n\n910\n00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:17,090\nit doesn't degrade\nthe lifetime of the disc.\n\n911\n00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,010\nIt does, but not by much.\n\n912\n00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:22,580\nYou should be able to get at least five\nyears out of an SSD with FileVault\n\n913\n00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,040\nturned on, and\nthose are pretty hard circumstances.\n\n914\n00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,850\nAn unencrypted drive should be able\nto get you seven to eight years now,\n\n915\n00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,170\na good long time.\n\n916\n00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:32,990\nSo, don't worry about that, don't\nworry about the lifetime of your SSD.\n\n917\n00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:36,330\nTurn on FileVault, it'll protect you and\nit'll be worth it, right?\n\n918\n00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:40,730\nOnce the drive is unlocked,\nthere's very negligible overhead\n\n919\n00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:43,630\ncreated by managing the encryption and\ndecryption of that data.\n\n920\n00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:46,830\nBut getting it encrypted in the first\nplace can be a time consuming process.\n\n921\n00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,130\nLet me show you how this works.\n\n922\n00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:52,430\nFirst off, when I go to turn it on,\nI get some warnings here, right?\n\n923\n00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:55,440\nSo I've got warning,\nyou will need your Login Password or\n\n924\n00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,570\na recovery key to access your data.\n\n925\n00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:01,380\nIn other words, you will not be able\nto access your data unless you log in.\n\n926\n00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,210\nSo if you lose your password,\nyou're screwed.\n\n927\n00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:04,520\nDon't lose your password.\n\n928\n00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,020\nThat's what's that's saying.\n\n929\n00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,800\nBut again, if you link to Apple IDs\nyou can always reset that way.\n\n930\n00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,060\nA recovery key is automatically\ngenerated as part of your setup.\n\n931\n00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,870\nIf you forget both your Password and\nthe Recovery key.\n\n932\n00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:19,890\nYou're out of luck,\nthere's no way to recover your data.\n\n933\n00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,070\nOnce the data is protected, once it's\nencrypted, you've got to store that\n\n934\n00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:29,260\nrecovery key somewhere safe so that if\nyour system gets messed up somehow,\n\n935\n00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,580\nif you lose your password,\nyou can use that to recover, alright?\n\n936\n00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,260\nThe recovery key, you can save it to\na USB key or something like that,\n\n937\n00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,890\nstick it in a vault somewhere and\nthen you've got it when you need it.\n\n938\n00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:41,850\nAll right, I'm gonna go and\nturn on my FileVault.\n\n939\n00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:46,050\nNow when I turn it on, it's gonna offer\nto use my iCloud account to lock and\n\n940\n00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,750\nunlock the disk, all right?\n\n941\n00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,800\nAgain if we use that, we have the safety\nmeasure of being able to recover our\n\n942\n00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,150\npassword through Apple ID.\n\n943\n00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,380\nSome people don't like that, though.\n\n944\n00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,410\nAnd they'd rather just do a recovery key,\nright?\n\n945\n00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:03,010\nCreate a recovery key and\ndo not use my iCloud account.\n\n946\n00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,300\nBy doing that,\nyou have control of that recovery key.\n\n947\n00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,810\nThe fear is,\nif we use iCloud to unlock it, and\n\n948\n00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:13,810\nsomebody hacks iCloud,\nthey could have my recovery key.\n\n949\n00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:17,180\nThey could have the encryption key to\nbe able to come and decrypt my laptop.\n\n950\n00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:21,850\nSo if you're worried about governments or\nmalicious attackers penetrating iCloud,\n\n951\n00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,190\nthen you'd want to do\nyour own recovery key.\n\n952\n00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,120\nYou now control it, all right?\n\n953\n00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,600\nBut if you want convenience,\nyou go ahead and use iCloud.\n\n954\n00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,664\nAnd I'll go ahead and use iCloud for mine.\n\n955\n00:47:32,275 --> 00:47:33,720\nAll right.\n\n956\n00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,620\nNow it's saying,\n\n957\n00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:38,580\neach user must type in their password\nbefore they'll be able to unlock the disk.\n\n958\n00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,950\nNotice that it's all of my users.\n\n959\n00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,480\nThe drive is encrypted.\n\n960\n00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,070\nIt's encrypted for everybody.\n\n961\n00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,930\nSo everybody has to be able to unlock it.\n\n962\n00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:50,917\nWell, I'm going to be able to unlock it\nbecause I'm the one who's doing this.\n\n963\n00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:52,840\nBut Nate, he won't be able to unlock it.\n\n964\n00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,250\nNow does that mean he\ncan't use the system?\n\n965\n00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,000\nNo.\n\n966\n00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,876\nIt just means that I have to log\nin first and unlock the disk and\n\n967\n00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:03,090\nthen we can switch over to his\nuser account and he'll be fine.\n\n968\n00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,990\nBut if I want Nate to be able to\nunlock the disk himself, not have me\n\n969\n00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:10,820\nlog in first, then I need to enable his\nuser so that he can decrypt the disk also.\n\n970\n00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,230\nSo I'll enable that and\nI'll punch in his password.\n\n971\n00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:18,060\nAnd it's his password, not my password,\n\n972\n00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:22,270\nbecause it's linking his key\nto the FileVault encryption.\n\n973\n00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,020\nSo I'll go ahead and check that off.\n\n974\n00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:25,661\nThere we go.\nSo,\n\n975\n00:48:25,661 --> 00:48:27,220\nnow I've got both of us enabled for that.\n\n976\n00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:29,540\nAll right.\n\n977\n00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,820\nAnd then it's gonna say it needs to\nrestart in order to enable FileVault.\n\n978\n00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,500\nAll right.\n\n979\n00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,800\nI'm gonna go ahead and restart it.\n\n980\n00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,864\nAnd while we're waiting on that let\nme talk a little bit about FileVault\n\n981\n00:48:37,864 --> 00:48:38,492\nversion one.\n\n982\n00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,730\nIf you're running Yosemite like this\n\n983\n00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:44,750\nit doesn't allow you to turn\non FileVault version one.\n\n984\n00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:47,200\nI can't choose to encrypt\njust my user folder.\n\n985\n00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,870\nThere is a hacky way to do it but\n\n986\n00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:52,220\nthere's no official supported graphical\nuser interface way of doing it.\n\n987\n00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,980\nAll right, so if I'm launching Mavericks,\nif I'm launching Yosemite.\n\n988\n00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,250\nI don't even have the option to\ndo FileVault version one, right?\n\n989\n00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:02,578\nIt's just FileVault version two,\nit encrypts the whole drive and\n\n990\n00:49:02,578 --> 00:49:04,268\nthat's typically what we want.\n\n991\n00:49:04,268 --> 00:49:08,070\nIf, you upgraded though,\nmaybe you were running Lion and\n\n992\n00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:12,840\nyou upgraded to Mountain Lion and then\nyou upgraded to Yosemite or Mavericks.\n\n993\n00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,090\nThen Yosemite, you jumped through\nseveral versions as you went across.\n\n994\n00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:21,340\nIf you did that, you might still have the\nold FileVault version one on your system\n\n995\n00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,150\nand it just hasn't been upgraded.\n\n996\n00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,222\nIf that's the case when you get logged in.\n\n997\n00:49:27,276 --> 00:49:29,459\nLet me just get logged in here.\n\n998\n00:49:29,459 --> 00:49:34,182\nWhen you go into that security and\nprivacy screen you'll actually have\n\n999\n00:49:34,182 --> 00:49:38,700\nthe FileVault tab and you'll have\na tab labeled legacy FileVault.\n\n1000\n00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,820\nYou'll see two FileVault tabs,\none's legacy for the old stuff.\n\n1001\n00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,890\nAnd for the old stuff it's\ngonna show the settings.\n\n1002\n00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:46,930\nThe master password for it,\n\n1003\n00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:51,342\nand it's gonna give you the opportunity\nto upgrade to FileVault version two.\n\n1004\n00:49:51,342 --> 00:49:52,350\nAll right?\n\n1005\n00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:55,520\nSo if you ever sit down on a computer and\nyou see the legacy file.\n\n1006\n00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,290\nIt'll appear right here.\n\n1007\n00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:59,950\nSo you see I've got FileVault, and then\nright beside it you have legacy FileVault.\n\n1008\n00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,060\nIf you see that, That's your queue.\n\n1009\n00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:06,460\nLike oh this has been upgraded all the way\nfrom 10.6 or earlier to where we are now\n\n1010\n00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,830\nand it still has legacy and you should\nconvert it over to FileVault version two.\n\n1011\n00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:13,860\nRight, just protecting the user\nfolder that's okay but\n\n1012\n00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,460\nif a user saves data outside\nof it your in trouble right.\n\n1013\n00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,600\nThe advantage of the legacy FileVault\nwas that each user had their own key\n\n1014\n00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,660\nversus when you do the whole disk,\neverybody has to share a key.\n\n1015\n00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,270\nRight?\n\n1016\n00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:27,631\nBut since most people don't\nshare a computer anyway,\n\n1017\n00:50:27,631 --> 00:50:30,570\nit's kind of a nonstarter of an issue and\nwe encrypt the whole disk.\n\n1018\n00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,970\nAll right now my system rebooted and\nI logged in really quick.\n\n1019\n00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:38,060\nNow I'm in and I'm working,\nI can actually use my computer right now.\n\n1020\n00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,190\nI can go browse the internet and\ndo whatever I want.\n\n1021\n00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:42,990\nBut it's encrypting the hard\ndisk in the background.\n\n1022\n00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:45,250\nIt's not actually done encrypting yet.\n\n1023\n00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,990\nIt brought my FileVault screen back up,\nand it shows encrypting down there.\n\n1024\n00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:52,660\nThis is a pretty small hard drive, I think\nI've got a whopping 20 gigs of data here.\n\n1025\n00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,340\nIt'll encrypt pretty fast,\nsays about five minutes.\n\n1026\n00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,010\nIf you have a terabyte of data,\n\n1027\n00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,730\nif you've got a huge amount of data,\nit could take hours and hours.\n\n1028\n00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:03,950\nSo you might start this right before\ngoing to bed and just let it run\n\n1029\n00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,790\nwhile you're asleep and then check on\nit in the morning and it'll be done.\n\n1030\n00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:09,910\nBut the cool thing is,\nI've logged in and so\n\n1031\n00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:13,450\nnow any new data that I\ncreate is being encrypted.\n\n1032\n00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:17,180\nAnd I can start using my computer and\njust let it encrypt in the background.\n\n1033\n00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,855\nSo I can get in here,\nstart browsing the Internet,\n\n1034\n00:51:19,855 --> 00:51:23,910\ndoing my work and my system will run\na little bit slower while it's doing this,\n\n1035\n00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:27,100\nbecause encrypting data is\na heavy mathematical operation.\n\n1036\n00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:27,680\nRight?\n\n1037\n00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,140\nSo, I'll have to wait as it goes\nthrough and does all that stuff.\n\n1038\n00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,960\nMy system will be a little slower.\n\n1039\n00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,360\nAnd then when it's done,\nI'll be ready to rock just like normal.\n\n1040\n00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,960\nEverything's gonna run well.\n\n1041\n00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,782\nAnd I'll be protected, all right?\n\n1042\n00:51:39,782 --> 00:51:43,110\nThat's FileVault and\nit's pretty cool, pretty easy, right?\n\n1043\n00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:44,940\nThat was not hard to turn on.\n\n1044\n00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,075\nThe only step I didn't show is\nif I chosen not to use iCloud,\n\n1045\n00:51:48,075 --> 00:51:51,399\nif I chosen to use my own private key,\nit would have prompted for\n\n1046\n00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:55,420\nme to save that and I could pop in\na USB key and save it to a USB key.\n\n1047\n00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,560\nYou can save it to the local hard drive,\nbut that's a really bad idea\n\n1048\n00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,270\nbecause that means it's going to\nget encrypted along with the drive.\n\n1049\n00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:04,800\nSo if you ever need to recover your\nrecovery key is now encrypted.\n\n1050\n00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,420\nSo you wanna store it to a USB key or\na CD.\n\n1051\n00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,030\nBurn it to a disk, if you want.\n\n1052\n00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:11,650\nAnd then, put it somewhere secure.\n\n1053\n00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:15,540\nIf somebody gets ahold of that drive,\nthey can decrypt your data and that's bad.\n\n1054\n00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,460\nAs you can imagine.\n\n1055\n00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,710\nAll right,\nlooks like it's actually almost done.\n\n1056\n00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:21,330\nOpe, nope.\n\n1057\n00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:22,970\nIt just went from five\nminutes to nine minutes.\n\n1058\n00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:26,550\nApparently, I looked at it wrong.\n\n1059\n00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:27,490\nNow it's gonna take longer.\n\n1060\n00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:29,370\nSo we don't have to sit and\nwait for that to encrypt.\n\n1061\n00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:30,710\nBut it's just gonna churn along.\n\n1062\n00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:31,350\nIt's two minutes.\n\n1063\n00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,660\nApparently it's all over the place today.\n\n1064\n00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,720\nBut it's gonna go through an encrypt and\n\n1065\n00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,510\nactually it looks like it\nmight be done encrypting.\n\n1066\n00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,300\nIt's flipped over to optimizing now.\n\n1067\n00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,760\nOptimizing it rearranges the data to\nput it in a way that makes sense.\n\n1068\n00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,410\nWe need operating system files\nfirst when we boot up, so\n\n1069\n00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,720\nit sets those up to be decrypted rapidly.\n\n1070\n00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,520\nAnd then other data we might need a lot\nless infrequently, like our apps, and so\n\n1071\n00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,810\nit moves those to do those afterwards.\n\n1072\n00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:56,350\nSo it's just optimizing, and\nas soon as it's done, I'm encrypted.\n\n1073\n00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:59,780\nOnce I'm encrypted,\nas an end-user I don't even notice it.\n\n1074\n00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:03,580\nWhen you boot up, you get a login screen,\nyou log in like normal, and off you go.\n\n1075\n00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:07,250\nYou don't realize that in the background\nyour login key is being used to\n\n1076\n00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,470\ndecrypt the hard drive so\nyou can access all of your resources.\n\n1077\n00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:11,180\nThat's invisible.\n\n1078\n00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,100\nWe don't see that.\n\n1079\n00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,460\nThat just happens without our knowledge.\n\n1080\n00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,150\nAll right.\n\n1081\n00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,890\nThere's also a few other things\nthat happen that we don't see.\n\n1082\n00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:20,100\nLike when we enable FileVault,\n\n1083\n00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:25,110\nit actually creates a little partition\non the hard drive that's hidden.\n\n1084\n00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,810\nIt doesn't show up here in disk utility.\n\n1085\n00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:30,140\nSee in disk utility I still have\nthis Macintosh HD and that's it.\n\n1086\n00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,640\nIt actually did create another\npartition that is unencrypted.\n\n1087\n00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,750\nWhen you boot, you've got to have\nsomething to boot off of and\n\n1088\n00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:40,390\nthere is this little unencrypted\npartition that it hits, so it can get you\n\n1089\n00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:45,110\nto a login screen, so that you can provide\nthe key to decrypt the rest of it.\n\n1090\n00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:48,490\nSo it does a couple of neat things in\nthe background, but when it's done,\n\n1091\n00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:51,760\nhere we go, encryption finished,\nmy drive's encrypted and\n\n1092\n00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,030\nas a regular user I just\nuse the system like normal.\n\n1093\n00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:58,940\nAnd if I were to reboot,\nlet me go ahead and restart this guy.\n\n1094\n00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,110\nWhen I reboot,\n\n1095\n00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:06,470\nI'm not gonna see any crazy difference\nthere, it's gonna just run like normal.\n\n1096\n00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:07,705\nIf I were to go to recovery,\n\n1097\n00:54:07,705 --> 00:54:11,640\nI'd have to provide my password though\nbecause the drive is encrypted.\n\n1098\n00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,790\nSo here I just come in and I login.\n\n1099\n00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:17,450\nIt never mentions the fact that\nthe hard drive's encrypted and\n\n1100\n00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,250\nI'm in and that's that.\n\n1101\n00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,860\nNotice that little white bar\ncrawling across the bottom.\n\n1102\n00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:25,410\nIt's now switching form that unencrypted\npartition that just showed me the login\n\n1103\n00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:29,580\nscreen over to the encrypted drive and\nthat's it doing that encryption key.\n\n1104\n00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:33,790\nAnd it takes a little bit the first time,\nso this is taking longer than normal.\n\n1105\n00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:37,170\nBut after the first time it's seamless,\nthe end-user doesn't notice,\n\n1106\n00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,460\nit's like on my own laptop,\n\n1107\n00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,750\nyou guys have seen me reboot my laptop a\nfew times, you don't even see that delay.\n\n1108\n00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,990\nIt just goes right through,\nbut now I'm in and\n\n1109\n00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:48,390\nas the regular user I can just get\nin here and start doing my work.\n\n1110\n00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:52,830\nSo pretty cool functionality,\neasy to turn on, on a laptop it's a must.\n\n1111\n00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:56,580\nOn a desktop, it's kind of optional,\nbased on your physical security.\n\n1112\n00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,660\nAll right, well,\nI think that about wraps it up.\n\n1113\n00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,620\nLet me just skim my notes,\nmake sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n1114\n00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,470\nI think I got it all.\n\n1115\n00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,010\nYes I did.\n\n1116\n00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:05,680\nAll right.\n\n1117\n00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,910\nSo, that's about it for\nuser account security and\n\n1118\n00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:09,580\nthat's really about it for user accounts.\n\n1119\n00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:13,090\nI know we spread this across three\nepisodes, but it's all good information.\n\n1120\n00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:15,500\nAnd it is all testable material.\n\n1121\n00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,560\nSo on that note we'll go head and\nwrap it up right here.\n\n1122\n00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,321\nLet me remind you guys if you have\nquestions on any of the things that we\n\n1123\n00:55:22,321 --> 00:55:24,550\ntalked about please feel free to ask.\n\n1124\n00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:27,580\nLive during the show you\ncan go to itpro.tv/live

and\n\n4\n00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:38,962\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:40,560\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,570\nBack again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n7\n00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,650\nWe're going to be picking back up\nwith a new objective in this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,840\nWe've been covering things like installing\nMac OS, working with user accounts.\n\n9\n00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,420\nToday we're going to take\na look at file storage.\n\n10\n00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:01,100\nNow, when you have a Mac, every Mac that's\nsold today has storage attached to it.\n\n11\n00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,410\nIt's kind of hard to do\nanything without storage.\n\n12\n00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,960\nAnd the storage that comes inside of your\nMac may be more than enough for you,\n\n13\n00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,000\nyou may be perfectly happy with it.\n\n14\n00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,700\nOr you might need to add more storage or\n\n15\n00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,210\nchange the existing\nstorage to meet our needs.\n\n16\n00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,620\nNot everybody has the same used\ncase scenarios as everybody else.\n\n17\n00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,750\nSo that default configuration that you get\nfrom Apple, we might want to manipulate\n\n18\n00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,480\nthat and that's what we're going to\ntalk about here in this episode.\n\n19\n00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,480\nThe first thing I want to\nmention is inside Mac OS,\n\n20\n00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,890\nthey're are really two types\nof storage that we have.\n\n21\n00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,890\nThere is fixed media or\nwhat we usually consider internal storage.\n\n22\n00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,860\nAnd then we've go removable media which\nwe usually consider as external storage.\n\n23\n00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,780\nWith internal storage,\n\n24\n00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,030\nthis is storage that is basically\nbuilt into your computer.\n\n25\n00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,330\nIf you wanted to take it out, you'd\nhave to unscrew your computer's case or\n\n26\n00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,960\nvoid your warranty or\nwhatever to get that out of there.\n\n27\n00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,720\nIt normally takes\nthe form of a hard drive.\n\n28\n00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,270\nAnd your hard drive on today's match,\nwhen you order it, you get a choice.\n\n29\n00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,760\nYou can go with a traditional magnetic\ndrive where it's got spinning\n\n30\n00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,330\nplatters inside of it,\nthat's our older style of storage, or\n\n31\n00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:09,620\nthe new storage, which is solid\nstate digital drives or SSDs.\n\n32\n00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,810\nAnd SSD gets rid of the spinning platter,\nand\n\n33\n00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,580\nit replaces it with flash memory chips.\n\n34\n00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,520\nIt's very similar to those USB\nthumb drives that you use,\n\n35\n00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,010\nexcept they're much higher quality and\nthey're much more expensive.\n\n36\n00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,570\nSSDs are considerably more\nexpensive than magnetic drives.\n\n37\n00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,650\nSo when you go to buy a new Mac and you\npick one out, you might be able to pick it\n\n38\n00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:36,550\nwith a one terabyte magnetic drive or\na 500 gig SSD, and the SSD\n\n39\n00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,660\nactually ends up being more expensive\neven though it's half the storage, right?\n\n40\n00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,000\nAnd it's because it's just a more\nexpensive media for storage right now.\n\n41\n00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,050\nAnd that'll change over\nthe next few years.\n\n42\n00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,150\nI'm sure probably three years from now we\nwon't see those magnetic drives anymore,\n\n43\n00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,670\nas everybody moves over to SSDs,\n\n44\n00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,870\nbut right now it's kind of an option to\nthe end user, it doesn't really matter.\n\n45\n00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,040\nWell, I guess it matters a little bit.\n\n46\n00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,390\nSSD is considerably faster\nthan magnetic storage.\n\n47\n00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,660\nBut the way that Mac OS sees\nit is pretty much the same.\n\n48\n00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,660\nThey'll see their little hard drive,\nthey can browse into it,\n\n49\n00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,940\nthey've got the files there.\n\n50\n00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,320\nThe way it functions for the end user is\nthe same, with the exception of speed.\n\n51\n00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,239\nSo, internal media, that's built into\nthe system, that's what it comes with.\n\n52\n00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:21,000\nExternal media, removable media, these\nare devices that we tag on after the fact\n\n53\n00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,370\nmost Mac's, like if you have a Mac mini or\n\n54\n00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,040\na Macbook Pro like mine, there's no\nexpansion room inside of the unit.\n\n55\n00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,320\nThere's no empty bay for\n\n56\n00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,340\nme to add additional storage\ninside of the unit itself.\n\n57\n00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,600\nSo, any extra storage that I\nneed I have to add externally.\n\n58\n00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,590\nAnd you can add them several\ndifferent ways, right.\n\n59\n00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,090\nYou have Firewire, Thunderbolt,\nUSB, right, several different ones.\n\n60\n00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,420\nI know in several episodes, you guys might\nhave noticed the little white hard drive I\n\n61\n00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,290\nkeep beside my laptop normally.\n\n62\n00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,300\nThat's a Thunderbolt drive that\nI store virtual machines on.\n\n63\n00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,650\nI'm not using any VMs today so\nI don't have it with me.\n\n64\n00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,190\nBut I actually do have a different drive.\n\n65\n00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,060\nJust this little hard drive here that I'm\ngoing to be using today which is USB.\n\n66\n00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,070\nSo you can plug it in via USB and\nyou can access that storage.\n\n67\n00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,690\nThere's other types of storage here,\nlike a SuperDrive.\n\n68\n00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,520\nIf you need a CD or DVD drive,\n\n69\n00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,160\nI know my laptop doesn't have\nan optical drive at all.\n\n70\n00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,230\nSo I have an Apple SuperDrive\nthat I can stick on the outside\n\n71\n00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,020\nto gain access to that storage.\n\n72\n00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:21,490\nWhatever mechanism you use, you're\njust adding storage to your system and\n\n73\n00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,630\nyou make it where you can work with it.\n\n74\n00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,310\nNow, there's a number of ideas that we\nneed to be aware of that we need to\n\n75\n00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,480\nunderstand, and some terminology that\nApple uses that we need to be familiar\n\n76\n00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,310\nwith if you want to be\nsuccessful on the exam.\n\n77\n00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,350\nSo I want to make sure\nthat we tackle that.\n\n78\n00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,800\nAnd for the most part,\nthis terminology is going to be the same\n\n79\n00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,810\nregardless of whether it's internal\nstorage or external storage.\n\n80\n00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,140\nWhether it's removable or\n\n81\n00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,870\nfixed, it's really all kind of handled\nthe same once the system sees it.\n\n82\n00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,940\nOkay.\n\n83\n00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:55,040\nSo, let's talk about how we find out\nwhat storage we got on our system.\n\n84\n00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,070\nWell, when I look at a system, if this is\nthe very first time that I've connected to\n\n85\n00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,160\na particular laptop or desktop, and\nI just wanna know what storage it has,\n\n86\n00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,040\nthere's a few things that I might need\nto do to figure that out, all right?\n\n87\n00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,080\nThe two main utilities that\nwe need to be familiar with\n\n88\n00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,940\nare the System Information Utility and\nthe Disk Utility.\n\n89\n00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,250\nNow, it makes sense that if I\nwant information about my disks,\n\n90\n00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,690\nthen I go to the disk utility, right?\n\n91\n00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,060\nThat's what it's for.\n\n92\n00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,500\nBut the information inside of the disk\nutility can be a little daunting for\n\n93\n00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,720\nyour average end user.\n\n94\n00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,780\nSo if you're ever on the phone with\nApple's tech support, they'll normally\n\n95\n00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,460\nsend you to the system information\nutility to find out about your storage.\n\n96\n00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,360\nAll right, so I want to launch\nthe system information utility and\n\n97\n00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,330\nI normally just use Spotlight and\ndo a quick search for system information.\n\n98\n00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,870\nBut if you wanna launch\nit from your hard drive,\n\n99\n00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,880\nyou can browse into your Macintosh HD,\nbrowse into the Applications folder, and\n\n100\n00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,350\ninside the Applications folder\nyou'll find the Utilities folder.\n\n101\n00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,640\nAnd inside of Utilities,\nyou will find System Information.\n\n102\n00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,530\nIt's actually the same place we'd go\nif we wanted to launch Disk Utility.\n\n103\n00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,130\nThey're both in there too.\n\n104\n00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,850\nBut System Information\nis the one that I want.\n\n105\n00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,620\nWhen you launch System Information,\nyou'll get this screen and\n\n106\n00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,760\nit'll display information\nabout your hardware.\n\n107\n00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,190\nSo I see just general info, right?\n\n108\n00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,450\nI have a MacBook Pro.\n\n109\n00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,720\nIt's got an Intel Core i7 and so on.\n\n110\n00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,440\nIt details that information.\n\n111\n00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,060\nIt even gives me a little bit of data\nabout the amount of memory and cache, but\n\n112\n00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,680\nnot much about storage\non this page right here.\n\n113\n00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,890\nBut there's plenty of information about\nyour storage to be found in here.\n\n114\n00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,260\nAnd as you look down the left side,\n\n115\n00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,450\nthere's several of these\nthat deal with that.\n\n116\n00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,440\nATA, that's gonna be our traditional\nmagnetic storage if you have any.\n\n117\n00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,520\nAs you continue going down,\n\n118\n00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,180\nyou'll see like Parallel SCSI,\nSAS, Serial ATA, right?\n\n119\n00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,720\nAnd on serial ATA, that just lit up,\nI do have a serial ATA drive and\n\n120\n00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,690\nI've got an Apple SSD controller\nwith an Apple SSD attached to it.\n\n121\n00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,580\nThen here I can see the hardware\ninformation about my disk.\n\n122\n00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,540\nI've got a 500 gig SSD.\n\n123\n00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,240\nIt's in my system and here's the details.\n\n124\n00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,210\nNow it's showing me information about\nthe disk, as well as the partitions,\n\n125\n00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,240\nas well as the volumes.\n\n126\n00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,625\nThere's actually a lot of data\nbeing represented here and\n\n127\n00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:06,465\nit's confusing what those three different\nterms mean, disk, volume, partition.\n\n128\n00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:09,500\nI want to hold off on that thought cuz\nI want to highlight exactly what those\n\n129\n00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,425\nthree mean.\n\n130\n00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:14,295\nBut as we interpret this data that's\nwhat we're seeing, the physical disk and\n\n131\n00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:15,765\nthe partitions and volumes that are on it.\n\n132\n00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,960\nNow this view right here is a lot of\ninformation for your normal end user.\n\n133\n00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,890\nSo a normal end user,\nif they're on the phone with Apple,\n\n134\n00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,980\nthey'll end up sending them down\nhere to the storage option.\n\n135\n00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,770\nStorage, and under storage you\nsee a much more high level view.\n\n136\n00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,880\nI can see I've got\nDon's USB drive hooked up.\n\n137\n00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,330\nIt's 250 gigs.\n\n138\n00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,150\nI've got Macintosh HD, that's 250 gigs and\nI've got Windows HD is 250 gigs.\n\n139\n00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,150\nI've got these different hard drives\nthat are present on my system.\n\n140\n00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,945\nWhat this doesn't communicate to me,\nis that Windows HD and Macintosh HD,\n\n141\n00:07:49,945 --> 00:07:55,390\nthose are two drives that are logical\ndrives on the same physical disk.\n\n142\n00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,076\nI have one 500 gig SSD that I've divided\nin half, so that I can have MAC OS and\n\n143\n00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:02,849\nWindows side by side right,\nit's boot camp.\n\n144\n00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:07,253\nWell it doesn't really tell me that here\nbut your average end user doesn't care\n\n145\n00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,475\nabout that, right,\nthey don't need that information,\n\n146\n00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:14,070\nversus if I went up here to\nSATA I saw that I had one SSD.\n\n147\n00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,660\nAnd on that SSD was my Macintosh hard\ndrive and my Windows hard drive,\n\n148\n00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,750\nas well as recovery that was hidden\nfrom the other screen, right?\n\n149\n00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,970\nSo the detailed information is that,\nif you're looking to find out what storage\n\n150\n00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,990\nyou got system information is a great\nplace to go, but it's not the only place.\n\n151\n00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,400\nThe other place I mentioned\nwas the Disk Utility and\n\n152\n00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,180\nthe disk utility is typically where I go.\n\n153\n00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,780\nIn this screen here,\nin system information,\n\n154\n00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,030\nwe can see information about our drives,\nbut we can't actually change anything.\n\n155\n00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,970\nIn this utility, we can change things.\n\n156\n00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,830\nSo, if I go to my Disk Utility,\nwhich is right there in the same\n\n157\n00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,650\nfolder as the system information,\nwhen we go in here,\n\n158\n00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,940\nnot only does it show me my storage\nin a nice, easy, graphical manner.\n\n159\n00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,280\nBut it also makes it where\nI can change things.\n\n160\n00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,860\nI see my SSD right here.\n\n161\n00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,830\nThere's that 500 gig SSD.\n\n162\n00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,480\nAnd I see the Macintosh HD and\nWindows HD nested underneath it.\n\n163\n00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,430\nSo I know they're both on\nthe same physical disk.\n\n164\n00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,420\nI've also got my 250 gig USB drive.\n\n165\n00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,560\nAnd it's got a hard drive on it, right?\n\n166\n00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,200\nNow, what we're seeing here on the left\nis the top most elements, these guys?\n\n167\n00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,630\nThese are my hard drives.\n\n168\n00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,560\nOn the exam,\nwhen they refer to a hard drive,\n\n169\n00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,360\nthey're referring to the physical disk.\n\n170\n00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,330\nAnd that's what you'll see at the top\nmost level of the disk utility.\n\n171\n00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,430\nUnderneath it, you see your partitions.\n\n172\n00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,850\nAnd a partition is a logical division\nthat we make inside of a drive.\n\n173\n00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,070\nYou can slice it up.\n\n174\n00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,770\nYou can divide it up into multiple pieces,\nall right?\n\n175\n00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,260\nThat's called a partition.\n\n176\n00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,860\nThat's like if you had a room and\n\n177\n00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,290\nyou put a partition wall in the middle\nof it, now you have two rooms, right?\n\n178\n00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,680\nYou've divided it in half.\n\n179\n00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,210\nAnd it doesn't have to be exactly half.\n\n180\n00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,210\nYou can divide it however you want.\n\n181\n00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,870\nJust be aware that it is a logical\ndivision, not a physical one.\n\n182\n00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,390\nSo for example, if I have one hard\ndrive and I've partitioned it in half,\n\n183\n00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,160\nif I divide it in half and\nthe hard drive fails, I lose both halves.\n\n184\n00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,520\nIt's not like one half can survive\na disk failure, I would lose both.\n\n185\n00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,330\nNow there's a number of reasons for\ndividing a disk up.\n\n186\n00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,240\nI know we talked about some of\nthis back in the install episodes.\n\n187\n00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,240\nIt might be that you wanna keep your user\ndata separate from the operating system.\n\n188\n00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,900\nYou might have multiple users that share\nthe computer and you wanna divide them up.\n\n189\n00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,398\nYou might be doing what I'm doing,\nboot camp.\n\n190\n00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:31,764\nYou might wanna have different operating\nsystems on the drive side by side and\n\n191\n00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,798\nyou can do that pretty easily right here,\nall right.\n\n192\n00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:38,760\nThe other thing that we can do\nis we can not use partitions.\n\n193\n00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,850\nMost people don't.\n\n194\n00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,110\nIf you don't use partitions, you could\ntake one physical disk like my USB disk\n\n195\n00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,150\nand just have one big partition on it.\n\n196\n00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,570\nAnd that's exactly what I've\ngot here with Don's USB.\n\n197\n00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,785\nNow I don't really know if\nthat's a full partition\n\n198\n00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,965\nthat covers the whole disk or not.\n\n199\n00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:56,400\nYou don't quite see it here.\n\n200\n00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,860\nBut when you choose the physical disk,\nwhen you choose the hard drive,\n\n201\n00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,000\nyou can hit this partition tab and\nthat will show you the partition layout.\n\n202\n00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,070\nAnd I can see the Don's USB covers\nthe entire disk, all right?\n\n203\n00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,660\nIf I take a look at my SSD and\n\n204\n00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,220\nI go to partition I can see the Macintosh\nhard drive is taking up some space, and\n\n205\n00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,270\nthe Windows hard drive\nis taking up some space.\n\n206\n00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,350\nSo, I can see that division,\nand how it's aligned.\n\n207\n00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,390\nSometimes, this bar will be a slider and\n\n208\n00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,580\nyou can adjust the size of the partitions,\nsometimes you can't.\n\n209\n00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,500\nIn my case because these are two\ncompletely different operating systems,\n\n210\n00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,090\nI can't adjust this,\nit's not gonna let me drag it.\n\n211\n00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,960\nI can make it smaller,\nmaybe I wanna shrink one of them.\n\n212\n00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,610\nBut it won't let me\nactually make it bigger.\n\n213\n00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,670\nAll right, so the partitions\nare the divisions that we create, but\n\n214\n00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,850\nthat's not enough.\n\n215\n00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,420\nIt's not usable just to\nhave a partition present.\n\n216\n00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,560\nOnce there's a partition we have\nto format the disk, all right?\n\n217\n00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,360\nYou're applying a file\nsystem on that disk.\n\n218\n00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,480\nAnd Mac OS supports a number\nof different file systems.\n\n219\n00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,070\nBut it's only once you have a file system\nthat Mac OS will actually see the drive,\n\n220\n00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,180\nthat the end user will be able to use it.\n\n221\n00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,424\nSo you have to have a physical disk, you\nhave to have at least one partition on it.\n\n222\n00:12:10,424 --> 00:12:13,376\nAnd then that partition has to\nhave a file system laid on it,\n\n223\n00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:15,720\nwhich is what turns it into a volume.\n\n224\n00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,283\nAnd that's those three terms that\nI mentioned hard disk, partition,\n\n225\n00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:21,440\nvolume, right?\n\n226\n00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,660\nEach one serves a different purpose and\n\n227\n00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,302\nat the end of the day what our\nengines work with, our volumes.\n\n228\n00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:32,875\nAll right, let's take for\nexample my USB drive, right?\n\n229\n00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:36,055\nNow it has one partition on there but\nlet's say that I wanna change that.\n\n230\n00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,025\nI don't have any data on there\nthat's too terribly important to me.\n\n231\n00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,315\nSo I might wanna get in here and\nmanipulate this layout.\n\n232\n00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:43,985\nI could take my disk.\n\n233\n00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:50,170\nI could go to erase, and it'll give me the\noption to erase that disk and wipe it out.\n\n234\n00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,400\nNow when I do that, if I erase\nthe disk it's gonna blank it out and\n\n235\n00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,700\ncreate one big partition on it.\n\n236\n00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,200\nAnd I'll have a choice between several\ndifferent file systems not all,\n\n237\n00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,040\nI'll talk more about the file\nsystems after the break.\n\n238\n00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,400\nBut for right now,\nI'm just going to create one big\n\n239\n00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,950\nDon's USB partition right there,\nand get that set up on that disk.\n\n240\n00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,030\nNotice on the left side\nthe partition disappeared, and\n\n241\n00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,700\nit just reappeared as disk one S2, right?\n\n242\n00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,860\nDisk one.\n\n243\n00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,070\nWell, Mac OS labels the disks\nstarting with zero.\n\n244\n00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,470\nMy internal SSD is disk zero.\n\n245\n00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,750\nThis USB drive is disk one,\nit's the second disk.\n\n246\n00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,570\nAnd then that S that appeared after it,\nthat referred to a slice.\n\n247\n00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,130\nWe've sliced the drive up into partitions.\n\n248\n00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,310\nI only had one, and so\nit labelled it as S.\n\n249\n00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,715\nNow, if it labelled it as S2,\nwhat's that all about?\n\n250\n00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:44,560\nWell, there's always,\npartitions start numbering from one.\n\n251\n00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,520\nIt's kind of annoying, right?\n\n252\n00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,130\nDisks start numbering from zero but\npartitions start numbering from one.\n\n253\n00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,460\nAnd there's always a first partition\nwhich is your boot record.\n\n254\n00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,850\nSo S1 is always taken up.\n\n255\n00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,460\nS2 is what it just created.\n\n256\n00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,170\nAnd so it showed us disk one, S2.\n\n257\n00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,910\nIf you see that, that naming,\n\n258\n00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,930\nwhat it means is you got a partition,\nbut it's not a volume yet.\n\n259\n00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,421\nIt either doesn't have\na file system on it or\n\n260\n00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:12,760\nit has a file system that\nMac OS doesn't support.\n\n261\n00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,240\nSo it can't figure out what it is and\nso it gives you the Unix name.\n\n262\n00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,310\nThe Unix name in this case was Disc 1 S2.\n\n263\n00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,480\nBut then it formatted it.\n\n264\n00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,580\nAnd once it applied that file system to\nthe drive, now Mac OS knows what it is.\n\n265\n00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,590\nAnd it's got a label, Don's USB.\n\n266\n00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,548\nAnd that's what I see now, Don's USB.\n\n267\n00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:31,460\nIt's right there.\n\n268\n00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,810\nThe disk is as I expected it.\n\n269\n00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,130\nYeah, James mentioned,\nthe naming convention came from Linux,\n\n270\n00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,250\nit's actually even older than that,\nit came from Unix back in the day.\n\n271\n00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,550\nBut it's very, very similar.\n\n272\n00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,730\nAnd there are some other OS's out there,\nthat changed that naming convention,\n\n273\n00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,990\nit's really annoying.\n\n274\n00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:51,090\nBut since Mac OS is built on top of\nBSD and BSD is built on top of Unix,\n\n275\n00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,540\nLinux is Unix-like, they all share\nthis common naming convention.\n\n276\n00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:59,501\nAnd it's really convenient, I really\nappreciate when companies do that.\n\n277\n00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:06,110\nAll right, so I've got one partition on\nhere, but maybe I wanna divide this up.\n\n278\n00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,540\nI wanna divide the drive in half or\ninto four or whatever.\n\n279\n00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,620\nYou can divide it up\ninto multiple partitions.\n\n280\n00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,560\nOn a Mac, you can have up to\n16 partitions on a drive.\n\n281\n00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,548\nWe can divide it up into\n16 partitions if we want.\n\n282\n00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:23,270\nThat's a little overkill in my opinion,\nbut maybe you've got a need for that.\n\n283\n00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,210\nSo when I choose a disk and\n\n284\n00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,600\nI go to the Partition tab, here's where\nI see the partitions that I've got.\n\n285\n00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,217\nAnd if you wanna make more partitions,\nyou can, for example,\n\n286\n00:15:34,217 --> 00:15:37,715\nshrink your existing partition down,\nright?\n\n287\n00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:40,600\nMaybe I wanna shrink this one down\nto something considerably smaller.\n\n288\n00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,247\nI'll shrink it down to about 64 gigs,\nright?\n\n289\n00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:47,630\nWell, I'm doing that and I don't have my\nlittle Apply button because I'm messing\n\n290\n00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,930\nwith a partition that already exists,\nthis guy.\n\n291\n00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,560\nSo it's a little mad at me there.\n\n292\n00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,830\nBut basically you can come in, you can\nshrink them down, and you can grow them.\n\n293\n00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,438\nIf you have empty space on there you can\nhit the plus sign to add more storage to\n\n294\n00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:00,450\nit that way too.\n\n295\n00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,650\nAnd you can add additional partitions.\n\n296\n00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,570\nBut the easiest way to do it.\n\n297\n00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,394\nIs to modify the partition layout\nwith the drop down box and you'll\n\n298\n00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:13,050\nsee in the drop down box that you can\nchose 1 partition, 2 all the way up to 16.\n\n299\n00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,350\nSo if I want to divide it in half I\ncan just chose two partitions and\n\n300\n00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,060\nnow its divided in half.\n\n301\n00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,710\nBut it doesn't have to be a 50/50 split.\n\n302\n00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:26,740\nYou saw my SSD, this one up here,\ndata 50/50 split between Mac and Windows.\n\n303\n00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,856\nBut you don't have to.\n\n304\n00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:32,372\nIf I want Mac OS on one perdition and\nmy user data on another.\n\n305\n00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:35,054\nHow much space does Mac OS really need?\n\n306\n00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:36,239\n20 gigs?\n\n307\n00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:36,877\n30 gigs?\n\n308\n00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:39,377\nIt doesn't need a whole lot of space for\nthe OS,\n\n309\n00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:42,060\nit's my user data that\ntakes all the space.\n\n310\n00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,720\nSo I might want to take this first\npartition and shrink it considerably.\n\n311\n00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,240\nI might make it,\nwe'll just say 50 gigs and\n\n312\n00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,870\nthen have partition two contain the rest.\n\n313\n00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,670\nRight now it's uneven but\nit meets my needs, right?\n\n314\n00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,420\nSo maybe I'm installing MacOS here,\nmy user data there.\n\n315\n00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,090\nIt's divided up.\nAll right?\n\n316\n00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,590\nSo, pretty cool that we can do that.\n\n317\n00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,840\nAnd then we can use the plus sign down\nhere to add in more partitions if we need\n\n318\n00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,490\nto as we start dividing that up.\n\n319\n00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,180\nAnd you can adjust them so\nthey're all different sizes.\n\n320\n00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,790\nNow, my sizes that I've been\nputting in haven't been perfect.\n\n321\n00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,110\nRight, they're always close\nto the number I want.\n\n322\n00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,950\nSo oftentimes what I'll do\nis I'll take the disks.\n\n323\n00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,920\nLet me just clean this up a little bit.\n\n324\n00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,656\nAnd I'll come over here and\njust type in the size.\n\n325\n00:17:22,656 --> 00:17:27,242\nSo if I want this first disk to be\n40 gigs, I can just type in 40.\n\n326\n00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:31,516\nAnd then this last one,\nmaybe I want it to be 200.\n\n327\n00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:37,860\nAll right, so, when I type this one in as\n200, see how that first one changed to 50?\n\n328\n00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,930\nThe disk utility always\ntries to use the full disk.\n\n329\n00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,360\nIf you want to leave empty space,\n\n330\n00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,630\nit doesn't really give you\na great way to do that.\n\n331\n00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,110\nYou'd have to really drop\ndown to the terminal and\n\n332\n00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,500\ndo it from the command line there.\n\n333\n00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,630\nIf we're just trying to get a nice,\neven distribution, you can come in and\n\n334\n00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,760\nset it, and then you're good to go.\n\n335\n00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,830\nAll right, now, what I'm working\nwith here is the physical disk.\n\n336\n00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,030\nMy physical disk is my USB drive.\n\n337\n00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,930\nAnd the partitions right here,\nI'm creating.\n\n338\n00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,150\nThat's what I'm defining, the partitions.\n\n339\n00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,170\nBut I'm not gonna be able to use these,\n\n340\n00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:13,220\nactually use them as an end user,\nuntil I turn them into a volume.\n\n341\n00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,270\nAnd I turn them into a volume\nby applying a file system to it.\n\n342\n00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,410\nAnd you probably already noticed this,\n\n343\n00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,480\nas I click on each, on the right side\nit's asking for me to format it.\n\n344\n00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,970\nAnd see how it is\ndefaulting to MS-DOS (FAT).\n\n345\n00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,490\nThat's one of several different file\nsystems supported by Mac OS, and\n\n346\n00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,720\nif I drop down my list I'll see that I\ncan choose from the different things.\n\n347\n00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,040\nNotice that one of the file\nsystems is free space.\n\n348\n00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,330\nWhat's that all about?\n\n349\n00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,360\nWell, remember how I said\nthat there's not really\n\n350\n00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,540\nan easy way to leave empty\nspace on the drive here.\n\n351\n00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,600\nWe have to go to terminals if\nwe wanted to go that route.\n\n352\n00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,840\nWell, there is one way, which is,\nyou can create a partition and\n\n353\n00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,670\nflag it as free space, and\nthat will leave it without a file system.\n\n354\n00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,050\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n355\n00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,700\nIf I want to create just one partition,\nand\n\n356\n00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:05,070\nI only want that partition to be 60 gigs,\nit doesn't let me do it.\n\n357\n00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,480\nWhat I have to do is say\nI want two partitions.\n\n358\n00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,220\nI want the first one to be 60 gigs.\n\n359\n00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,080\nSo now this first one is exactly 60 gigs.\n\n360\n00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,940\nAnd then I can take my second\npartition and set it as free space.\n\n361\n00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,940\nAnd see how it kind of disappeared?\n\n362\n00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,910\nIt says this purchase will\nbe left as free space.\n\n363\n00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,710\nSo now I've got my 60 gig partition and\na bunch of empty space.\n\n364\n00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,810\nIf I hit Apply,\nit's going to partition that out.\n\n365\n00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,570\nWe'll let it petition out.\n\n366\n00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,990\nAnd now, I've got that drive.\n\n367\n00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,340\nI've got that partition.\n\n368\n00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,450\nAnd, this one's a volume.\n\n369\n00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,940\nIt actually did format this one.\n\n370\n00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,490\nIt shows up and\nI can see it on my desktop over here.\n\n371\n00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,390\nI've got untitled 1, but\nthe free space doesn't show up.\n\n372\n00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,680\nAnd if I look at my partition scheme, that\nfree space is right there, and it's empty.\n\n373\n00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,170\nSome file systems,\nwill let you dynamically go and\n\n374\n00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,390\nstretch that partition to fill up\nthe empty space, if you want later on.\n\n375\n00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,420\nThe file system that I chose was MS DOS,\nit doesn't support that.\n\n376\n00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,080\nAnd we'll talk about those later.\n\n377\n00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,710\nBut, you can stretch them out, you can add\nin more partitions to start consuming that\n\n378\n00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,390\nspace, but you've got it available,\nand you can work with it.\n\n379\n00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,170\nSo a couple of neat options when it\ncomes to setting up the partitions.\n\n380\n00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,930\nBut the real decision we make is\ngoing to be setting up the volumes.\n\n381\n00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,770\nSo I want to spend a little bit of\ntime talking about the different\n\n382\n00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,680\nformats that we can\napply to the system and\n\n383\n00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,740\nthe file systems we can apply to\nthese partitions to make them useful.\n\n384\n00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,670\nEach one has their own little pros and\ncons.\n\n385\n00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,380\nI want to run down that list and\nkind of explain them all.\n\n386\n00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,256\nBut for right now, I'm a little\nshort on time on this segment,\n\n387\n00:20:34,256 --> 00:20:36,168\nit's a good time to stop and take a break.\n\n388\n00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:41,104\nSo let's pause here and when get back,\nwe'll take a look at volumes after this.\n\n389\n00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:47,959\n[MUSIC]\n\n390\n00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:49,538\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n391\n00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:53,260\nSo let's talk about file systems.\n\n392\n00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,600\nWhen you get a brand new drive and\n\n393\n00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,790\nyou hook it up to your computer,\nthe odds are the file system that's on\n\n394\n00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,400\nthere from the factory is not\ngonna be the one that you want.\n\n395\n00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,870\nThere are a number of different file\nsystems that you can choose from and\n\n396\n00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,210\neach one has their pros and cons.\n\n397\n00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,530\nWhen you buy a hard drive\nfrom the computer store or\n\n398\n00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:14,105\nwhatever, It will normally come with\na generic format on there that's\n\n399\n00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:18,305\nprimary goal is to be the most compatible\nwith as many systems as possible.\n\n400\n00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:21,345\nSo they'll pick a file system\nthat'll work on Windows, and Mac,\n\n401\n00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:23,102\nand Unix Linux whatever.\n\n402\n00:21:23,102 --> 00:21:26,542\nThey try and pick something that's\nvery stable and very compatible.\n\n403\n00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:30,362\nThe problem is, in order to achieve\nthat high level of compatibility,\n\n404\n00:21:30,362 --> 00:21:32,302\nyou give up a lot of features.\n\n405\n00:21:32,302 --> 00:21:36,130\nSo if we want the advanced features\nthat we have inside of Mac OS\n\n406\n00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,790\na lot of times we're gonna have to\nreformat those drives that we get.\n\n407\n00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,200\nThe drives that we get from Apple?\n\n408\n00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,740\nThose are fine.\n\n409\n00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,610\nThose are already set\nthe way that we want them.\n\n410\n00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,430\nBut the drives we get from other\nvendors might need some tweaking.\n\n411\n00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,800\nWell, let's talk about that tweaking bit.\n\n412\n00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,330\nLet's talk about those file systems and\n\n413\n00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,970\nhow we choose the one that's\nappropriate for our need.\n\n414\n00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,660\nNow, you might have noticed when I\nformatted this disc a moment ago,\n\n415\n00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,090\nwhen I partitioned my USB drive,\nit gave it a name of UNTITLED 1.\n\n416\n00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,900\nAnd it's all capital and\nit's very un-Apple.\n\n417\n00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,270\nRight?\nWith Apple we expect a certain aesthetic.\n\n418\n00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,750\nAt a minimum, they wouldn't give\nus all capital letters like that.\n\n419\n00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,680\nThat's crazy.\n\n420\n00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,820\nWell the reason is,\nit picked a very old file system.\n\n421\n00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,800\nIt picked a file system that uses capital\nletters in its labeling like that.\n\n422\n00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,150\nWell, I just went with that\nbecause it was the default and\n\n423\n00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,850\nI didn't want to mess with it at the time,\nbut now I do.\n\n424\n00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,870\nWhen I format a drive,\nI have to make a decision.\n\n425\n00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:28,110\nWhat file system do I want to use,\nand how do I want to make use of it?\n\n426\n00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,130\nSo what I'm going to do,\n\n427\n00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,770\nI'm going to take this drive and\nI'm going to re-partition it.\n\n428\n00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,860\nI'm going to give it four partitions.\n\n429\n00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,490\nOkay?\n\n430\n00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,180\nAnd so I've got untitled 1,\nuntitled 2, untitled 3, untitled 4.\n\n431\n00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,460\nThese are just the four partitions\nthat it just made for me.\n\n432\n00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,260\nWhen I click on each one,\non the right side,\n\n433\n00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,930\nI see information about\nthe partition in a format.\n\n434\n00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,450\nAnd it's the formatting that\ndetermines what file system we use,\n\n435\n00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,510\nwhich is what makes it a volume\nthat we can access on the system.\n\n436\n00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,250\nAnd it's defaulted to MS DOS FAT,\nall right?\n\n437\n00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,370\nFAT stands for File Allocation Table, and\n\n438\n00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,530\nthis is a technology that was\ndeveloped back in the 1980s.\n\n439\n00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,050\nIt's a very old technology,\nbeen around a long time.\n\n440\n00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,710\nAnd it was designed back in a time when\n\n441\n00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,650\na 20 megabyte hard drive\nwas considered massive.\n\n442\n00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,030\nIf you had a 20 megabyte hard drive\nback in the 80s you were a government,\n\n443\n00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,430\nnobody could actually afford that,\nit was insane.\n\n444\n00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,880\nToday hard drives\nare considerably larger and\n\n445\n00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,640\nthe file allocation table structure\nis really showing its age.\n\n446\n00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,620\nBack then, it had a lot of limits.\n\n447\n00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,320\nFile names had to be eight characters\nwith a three character extension,\n\n448\n00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,900\nthe casing didn't matter.\n\n449\n00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,810\nIf it was upper case or lower case,\nit would have treated it all the same.\n\n450\n00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,040\nSo, when it stored things, it almost\nalways stored it in all capital letters.\n\n451\n00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,830\nHad a lot of limitations like that.\n\n452\n00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,550\nAnd as drives got bigger,\nthey had to revise it,\n\n453\n00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,810\ninto FAT16,\nwhich was a 16-bit addressing model.\n\n454\n00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,030\nAnd then they went to FAT32,\nwhich is a 32 bit addressing model.\n\n455\n00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,680\nAnd that's what this actually is,\nis FAT 32.\n\n456\n00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,827\nIt doesn't say it but that's what it is.\n\n457\n00:23:55,827 --> 00:24:01,076\nSo that FAT it just hasn't really kept\nup with the times, but when you buy\n\n458\n00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:07,038\na USB drive from a vendor out there, A lot\nof times it'll be formatted as FAT32.\n\n459\n00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:08,418\nAnd why is that?\n\n460\n00:24:08,418 --> 00:24:13,870\nWell the reason is this file system is so\nold that a lot of people support it.\n\n461\n00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:20,373\nLinux, Windows, Mac OS, they can all\nread and write to a FAT32 drive.\n\n462\n00:24:20,373 --> 00:24:21,890\nThat makes it ideal.\n\n463\n00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,560\nIf I've got a USB disk that I'm gonna\nbe moving from computer to computer,\n\n464\n00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,740\nif it's FAT32, I know it'll work on those\nother systems, but FAT32 has some limits.\n\n465\n00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,760\nFor example,\nit has a maximum file size or 4GB.\n\n466\n00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,570\nWell do you every work\nwith files over 4GB?\n\n467\n00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,140\nI do.\n\n468\n00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,020\nI have a lot of disk images,\nmy installation images.\n\n469\n00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,564\nThose things will get over\n4 gigs pretty easily and\n\n470\n00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,061\nyou won't be able to put\nthose on a FAT32 drive.\n\n471\n00:24:45,061 --> 00:24:45,561\nThat's a problem.\n\n472\n00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,650\nThere's also other issues like for\n\n473\n00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:53,470\na Mac you can't boot up\nMac OS from a FAT 32 drive.\n\n474\n00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:58,160\nSo you're operating system can't use\na FAT 32 drive as its system disk.\n\n475\n00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,562\nIt can use it to store data on,\nsure it will be fine with that, but\n\n476\n00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:02,713\nit won't actually be able to\nboot the operating system.\n\n477\n00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:08,110\nSo FAT32's not the greatest file system\nfor us, but it is extremely compatible.\n\n478\n00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:12,980\nNow, I'll tell you one big problem I\nhave with FAT32, it's extremely fragile.\n\n479\n00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,580\nIf I improperly eject a disk,\n\n480\n00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,180\nright, you know when I'm done with a disk,\nI'm supposed to eject it, right?\n\n481\n00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,940\nAnd you can take the disk and\ndrag it and drop it into your trash or\n\n482\n00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,280\nyou can go into finder and\neject it that way, right?\n\n483\n00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,050\nIf I find my untitled one and\nhit the eject button.\n\n484\n00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,220\nIf you eject it, it closes off all\nthe files that you had open and\n\n485\n00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,380\nmakes sure that nothing gets damaged,\nright?\n\n486\n00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,280\nBut if I improperly pull it,\nif I just yank my USB cable out, if I'm\n\n487\n00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,760\npartially involved in writing data to this\nThe FAT32 partition will get corrupted.\n\n488\n00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,130\nIt happens almost every time.\n\n489\n00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,930\nIt's very easy to recreate this.\n\n490\n00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,070\nSo it's a fragile file system.\n\n491\n00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,800\nYou don't wanna rely on that\nif you can avoid it, right?\n\n492\n00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,230\nYou don't want that to be\nyour primary file system.\n\n493\n00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,739\nSo instead, we have other choices.\n\n494\n00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,657\nBut for this first partition,\nI'm gonna go ahead and format it as FAT32.\n\n495\n00:26:03,657 --> 00:26:06,966\nSo this one is\nFile Allocation Table 32-bit.\n\n496\n00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,190\nSo I'm formatting that one as FAT32.\n\n497\n00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,870\nFor my next partition,\nI'll hit that drop down box and\n\n498\n00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,620\nlook at some of the other\nones that we've got.\n\n499\n00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:20,620\nNotice there's one called exFAT,\nthat's the Extended File Allocation Table.\n\n500\n00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,370\nThis is the file system that Microsoft\nhas created that is a well like the name\n\n501\n00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,160\nimplies, an extended version\nof the old FAT file system.\n\n502\n00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,060\nIt allows for\nconsiderably larger files, right?\n\n503\n00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,350\nSo we don't have that file\nsize problem that we use to.\n\n504\n00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,043\nBut, it's still just as fragile as FAT32.\n\n505\n00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:41,020\nIt really just corrected being\nable to handle larger disks and\n\n506\n00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,580\nhandle larger files.\n\n507\n00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,750\nSo if you've got a 1 terabyte drive, or\n\n508\n00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,850\na 4 terabyte drive,\nexFAT can handle that just fine, right?\n\n509\n00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,070\nVersus FAT32,\nthat really freaks out after 2 terabytes.\n\n510\n00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,980\nIf you get 2 terabytes\non a partition size,\n\n511\n00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,640\nFAT32 starts to crap out,\nexFAT will do fine.\n\n512\n00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,760\nMac OS can read and write to exFAT.\n\n513\n00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,520\nIt can't boot off of it.\n\n514\n00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,480\nIt can't use it as a system disk,\nbut you can read and write to exFAT.\n\n515\n00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,090\nSo it's perfectly happy with that.\n\n516\n00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,230\nAnd I'll format this one as exFAT.\n\n517\n00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,740\nFor my next one, if I drop down that list,\nI've got some Mac file systems.\n\n518\n00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,070\nNotice that I've got\nMac OS Extended (Journaled), And\n\n519\n00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,700\nMac OS extended, case sensitive journal.\n\n520\n00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,100\nWhat are these?\n\n521\n00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,960\nWell it is actually two variations\nof the same file system.\n\n522\n00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,650\nYears ago, Apple created the file system\nwhich is just called Mac OS extended.\n\n523\n00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,010\nThey had an older file\nsystem that they used under.\n\n524\n00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,770\nI forget which versions switched over.\n\n525\n00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,310\nIt's really right when they switched\nfrom PPC over to Intel processors\n\n526\n00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:48,520\nthat they abandoned their old file system\nand moved over to the Mac OS Extended.\n\n527\n00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,060\nAnd when they did that,\nthey introduced a lot of neat features.\n\n528\n00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,490\nOne of the best features was journaling.\n\n529\n00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,470\nAnd notice how both of these say journal.\n\n530\n00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,110\nWhat the heck is journaling?\n\n531\n00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,310\nRemember my complaint about\nhow fragile FAT 32 is.\n\n532\n00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:07,290\nNow fragile X that is, and\nif you improperly eject them or\n\n533\n00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,139\nif you have a power outage\nthey get corrupt very easily.\n\n534\n00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,250\nJournaling prevents that.\n\n535\n00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,540\nHere's the way journaling works, let's\nsay I've got a file on my hard drive.\n\n536\n00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,840\nSo I've got a file called donsresume.txt,\nall right?\n\n537\n00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,790\nIf I open up that file and I start to\nedit it, I'm editing in RAM, right,\n\n538\n00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,580\nwe work on stuff in RAM.\n\n539\n00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,280\nAnd it's not until I hit save that\nit writes it to the hard drive.\n\n540\n00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,400\nAnd when I hit save, it writes that\nentire file to the hard drive.\n\n541\n00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,500\nIf the file were 64k, it's got to write\n64 kilobytes in data to the drive.\n\n542\n00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:45,150\nWell, if I improperly eject a drive or if\nI have a power outage halfway through that\n\n543\n00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,600\nwrite operation, I've written half the\nfile, I haven't written the other half and\n\n544\n00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,730\nthen I lose power, what's gonna happen\nto that file when I boot back up?\n\n545\n00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:57,090\nOnly half the file was written,\nthe rest of it is damaged.\n\n546\n00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,440\nAnd I have a corrupt file and\nnow I'm not able to access that resource.\n\n547\n00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,500\nThat's a problem, right?\n\n548\n00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:08,000\nJournaling fixes that by saying okay,\nfrom now on, when you write to the disk.\n\n549\n00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,615\nYou don't actually write to the file\nyou're trying to write to, instead you\n\n550\n00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:17,727\nwrite to a little protected area over here\nthis space that we've set aside over here,\n\n551\n00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:22,768\nand you write to that, and only when\nyou're 100% done writing to that journal,\n\n552\n00:29:22,768 --> 00:29:27,122\ndo we repoint the original file over\nto this thing that you've written?\n\n553\n00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:29,442\nAll right, but if you're only way through,\n\n554\n00:29:29,442 --> 00:29:32,750\nwe still have the original file\nthat we didn't let you write to.\n\n555\n00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,730\nWe saved it, it's saved over\nhere where you didn't touch it.\n\n556\n00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,360\nIt's almost like you have\ntwo copies of a file.\n\n557\n00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,920\nThe file as it was before and the new\nfile that you're writing to it that\n\n558\n00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,560\nwill replace it if a 100%\nof your write finishes.\n\n559\n00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,580\nBut if anything less than 100% finishes,\nif you reboot, if you have a power outage,\n\n560\n00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,720\nif you improperly disconnect the drive\nhalf way through, you've still got 100% of\n\n561\n00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,860\nthe old file, you've only got 50% of the\nnew file, it just throws away that 50%.\n\n562\n00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,200\nSo instead of getting a corrupted file,\nyou still have an intact file.\n\n563\n00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,630\nYou lost your changes, right?\n\n564\n00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,190\nWe didn't get the changes that were made.\n\n565\n00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,450\nThat didn't happen.\n\n566\n00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,720\nBut at least my file is not corrupt.\n\n567\n00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,140\nThat's what journaling does.\n\n568\n00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,930\nAnd it is a excellent mechanism to have.\n\n569\n00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,110\nIt's something that I highly recommend.\n\n570\n00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:21,020\nAnd other operating systems that are out\nthere that don't have support for\n\n571\n00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,400\njournaling file systems\nare really missing out.\n\n572\n00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,840\nOn a Mac, I know that if I'm\nin a really big hurry and\n\n573\n00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,140\nI have to improperly disconnect the drive,\nI have a certain degree of certainty.\n\n574\n00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,630\nWell, that's kind of redundant.\n\n575\n00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:38,100\nBut, I'm fairly certain that my data will\nbe intact when I plug that drive back in.\n\n576\n00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,340\nVersus FAT32,\nwhere I've gotta be really careful and\n\n577\n00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,760\nmake sure that I eject the disk,\nwait for it to close, wait for\n\n578\n00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,770\nthe icon to disappear,\nand then take it off.\n\n579\n00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,810\nI've got to be really careful\ncuz I know how fragile that is.\n\n580\n00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:54,500\nThe Mac OS extended file system\nwith journaling is far more stable,\n\n581\n00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,860\nfar more secure and intact.\n\n582\n00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,000\nIt doesn't get corrupted\nas easily as FAT and exFAT.\n\n583\n00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,670\nSo we definitely want that.\n\n584\n00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,760\nAll right, now, on the exam you might\nsee them mention Mac OS extended without\n\n585\n00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,410\njournaling, you don't see\nthat in the GUI though.\n\n586\n00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,530\nI can't, I don't even have that option.\n\n587\n00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,110\nWhen you do the install\nit does journaling.\n\n588\n00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,970\nSo journaling is the default.\n\n589\n00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,240\nIf you want to do it without journaling,\n\n590\n00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,210\nyou actually have to drop down to\nyour terminal and do it from there.\n\n591\n00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,930\nThey don't give you a way\nto bypass that anymore.\n\n592\n00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:25,130\nOn older Macs, right when they switched\nto Intel from PPC, they had it where\n\n593\n00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,960\nyou could do it without journaling,\nand journaling was added afterwards.\n\n594\n00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,690\nBut all current Macs, you got it.\n\n595\n00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,550\nNow there is a second option here,\nMac OS extended case sensitive.\n\n596\n00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,460\nWhat's that all about?\n\n597\n00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,440\nI want to show you that and it's best\nto show than trying to and explain but\n\n598\n00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,840\nnormally when we store a file on\nthe file system, it has a casing.\n\n599\n00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,860\nYou have capital letters and\nlowercase letters and so on.\n\n600\n00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:55,140\nBut when we refer to the file, it doesn't\nreally matter whether we do uppercase or\n\n601\n00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,679\nlowercase, it treats it all the same.\n\n602\n00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,219\nMac OS is built on top of DSD.\n\n603\n00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:03,380\nBSD was built off of Unix.\n\n604\n00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,890\nAnd Unix used a posix\ncompliant file system.\n\n605\n00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:13,120\nAnd posix defines several different ways\nthat file systems had to be structured.\n\n606\n00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,750\nAnd one of the requirements was that\nthe case of a filename mattered.\n\n607\n00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,840\nAnd if you had two files with the exact\nsame name but different casing,\n\n608\n00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,960\nthey were treated as two files.\n\n609\n00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,970\nAnd that's confusing.\n\n610\n00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,590\nSo let me show you what I mean.\n\n611\n00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,770\nI'm going to take this Untitled 3 here.\n\n612\n00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:35,190\nI'll make that one extended journaled,\nand so I'm just going to call it that.\n\n613\n00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:44,121\nHere, we'll call it\nMac OS Extended Journaled.\n\n614\n00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:46,900\nAnd then we'll take this other one, and\n\n615\n00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:53,360\nI'm going to do it\nMac OS Extended Case-Sensitive.\n\n616\n00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,160\nWhich, I forget what the maximum length\nof a label is so I might hit it.\n\n617\n00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,770\nLet's see what it lets\nme get away with here.\n\n618\n00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,140\nI'm trying to do just the same right\nthere so we keep it consistent.\n\n619\n00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,470\nThere we go, all right.\n\n620\n00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,580\nSo now I've got these four volumes.\n\n621\n00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,010\nFour different file systems.\n\n622\n00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:17,140\nFAT32, exFAT, Extended Journaled, and\nExtended Case Sensitive Journaled.\n\n623\n00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,530\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\napply that.\n\n624\n00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,450\nAnd it's going to divide up my USB drive.\n\n625\n00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,040\nIt's gonna divide it into\nthose four partitions.\n\n626\n00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,630\nAll with four different\nfile systems on there.\n\n627\n00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:34,190\nSo I've got four volumes that all have\ndifferent features and functionality.\n\n628\n00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,800\nSome that are very fragile.\n\n629\n00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,370\nSome that are very stable.\n\n630\n00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,630\nSome that support case sensitivity,\nsome that don't.\n\n631\n00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,670\nWhich one is the right one for you?\n\n632\n00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,130\nIt depends, all right.\n\n633\n00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,630\nIf I want to drive I can move in\nbetween Mac and Windows easily.\n\n634\n00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:52,860\nWell I don't want to use Mac OS extended\nbecause a Windows machine can't read that.\n\n635\n00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,060\nApple does have drivers where you can\nread from those disks but not write.\n\n636\n00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,020\nThere are some third parties like Paragon.\n\n637\n00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,900\nThey have a program,\nI think it's like $20, it's not expensive,\n\n638\n00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,330\nit'll allow Windows to Machine to\nwrite to Mac OS extended partitions.\n\n639\n00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,000\nBut it's not officially supported.\n\n640\n00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,540\nSo that's not a great way to\nmove files between computers.\n\n641\n00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,600\nIf I want compatibility I can go FAT32,\nbut\n\n642\n00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,610\nif I need large files FAT32 won't do it.\n\n643\n00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:22,580\nSo exFAT gives me large files and\ncompatibility but it's fragile.\n\n644\n00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,130\nEach ones has pros and cons.\n\n645\n00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:28,350\nYou pick the one that's appropriate for\nyour environment.\n\n646\n00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,990\nNow each of these just got partitioned,\njust got formatted,\n\n647\n00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,790\nthey have a file system,\nand now they're volumes.\n\n648\n00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,790\nEach one is showing up\nright here on my desktop.\n\n649\n00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,330\nI've got FAT32, XFAT,\nMac OS Extended Journal, and\n\n650\n00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,580\nMac OS extended, case sensitive, journal.\n\n651\n00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,250\nThese are volumes.\n\n652\n00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,350\nAnd an end user sees them as drive icons,\nright?\n\n653\n00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:53,720\nIf they go in to the user,\nthey'll see them in here.\n\n654\n00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,630\nHere's all those little volumes,\nthat I just had, okay?\n\n655\n00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,830\nThey're all right there,\nand I can inject them.\n\n656\n00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,690\nNow, in this case, if I inject them, I do\nhave to be careful, because they're all in\n\n657\n00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:06,440\nthe same USB drive, so if I eject one,\nit will want to eject all four of them.\n\n658\n00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,119\nBut I can remove those,\nbecause they're USB.\n\n659\n00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:12,480\nNow I mentioned that they're volumes.\n\n660\n00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,768\nThese are being mounted behind\nthe scene by the BSD under system.\n\n661\n00:35:16,768 --> 00:35:22,343\nIf I go into my terminal, all right so\nhere I am in my terminal,\n\n662\n00:35:22,343 --> 00:35:26,011\nand I change into the /volumes folder.\n\n663\n00:35:26,011 --> 00:35:31,540\nSo my path here is /volume,\nthat's where I'm at on the drive.\n\n664\n00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:36,630\nAnd if I take a look in there,\nyou'll see where I've got exFAT, FAT32,\n\n665\n00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:41,880\nMac OS extended case sensitive journal and\nMac OS extended journal.\n\n666\n00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,775\nRight, there's those different partitions\nthat are available for me, and\n\n667\n00:35:46,775 --> 00:35:49,085\nI can access each one of them\nbrowsing to it to get to them,\n\n668\n00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:51,175\nnotice a different colorations for\nsome of them?\n\n669\n00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:53,335\nAnd it's coming down to\nthe file system it's on,\n\n670\n00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:57,042\nand whether the file system is fully\nsupported or partially supported.\n\n671\n00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:59,442\nLike exFAT an FAT32\nare showing up as that yellow,\n\n672\n00:35:59,442 --> 00:36:02,992\nbecause they don't support\npermissions on those folders.\n\n673\n00:36:02,992 --> 00:36:07,032\nThat function they don't have,\nversus Mac OS extended which does, so\n\n674\n00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:07,942\nwe get a different coloring.\n\n675\n00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:13,312\nAlright, now I mentioned case sensitivity.\n\n676\n00:36:13,312 --> 00:36:14,042\nLet's take a look at that,\n\n677\n00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:18,800\nI'm gonna go into my non case\nsensitive folder real quick.\n\n678\n00:36:21,253 --> 00:36:24,220\nAnd let me just change into that.\n\n679\n00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,510\nMy path is gonna get really long.\n\n680\n00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,790\nLet me change this so we'll be able\nto see this as best as possible.\n\n681\n00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:38,780\nSo here I am,\nI'm in my /Volumes/Mac OS Extended.\n\n682\n00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,900\nActually let me start\nout not case sensitive.\n\n683\n00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:46,590\nHere we go.\n\n684\n00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:51,050\nSo I'm on the Mac OS extended\njournal disk, all right?\n\n685\n00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,606\nIf I create a file in here,\nif I create a file called,\n\n686\n00:36:54,606 --> 00:36:58,751\nlet's do resume.txt.\n\n687\n00:36:58,751 --> 00:36:59,910\nAll right?\n\n688\n00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,290\nSo this is gonna be my resume.\n\n689\n00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,740\nSo I just created a file.\n\n690\n00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,485\nIt's right there.\n\n691\n00:37:03,485 --> 00:37:05,540\nResume.txt.\n\n692\n00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,270\nAll right.\n\n693\n00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:09,730\nAnd if I edit that file and\nput some data in it, right.\n\n694\n00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,080\nSo, if I say like, I'll use vi.\n\n695\n00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,900\nWe'll go a little Unixy here for\na minute, but, if we go in and edit that.\n\n696\n00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,770\nI'm just saying I want to edit resume\ndot text and I'm doing it all lowercase\n\n697\n00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:25,210\nbecause that's how I created the file and\nso I can say this is my resume.\n\n698\n00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:29,550\nAll right.\n\n699\n00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,450\nAnd if I use the more command to view it,\nthere is is.\n\n700\n00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,440\nThis is my resume, alright?\n\n701\n00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,770\nNow I did that all lowercase.\n\n702\n00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:45,170\nIf I come in and\nI say more Resume.txt with a capital R.\n\n703\n00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,420\nAnd I run it.\n\n704\n00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,370\nI get this is my resume.\n\n705\n00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,390\nIf I do Resume with a capital R,\na capital S, and\n\n706\n00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,270\na capital E, this is my resume, right?\n\n707\n00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:59,130\nOr if I do it in all capital,\nRESUME.txt, right?\n\n708\n00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,470\nThe case of the filename doesn't matter.\n\n709\n00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:05,670\nIt's treating all of those\nas the same file, okay?\n\n710\n00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:10,410\nSo no variation there, it treats them\nall as the same file, all right?\n\n711\n00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,190\nI use the touch command to create\nthat file, and I created resume.txt.\n\n712\n00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:19,170\nIf i do touch.resume.txt like that, and\n\n713\n00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,880\nI take look, see how it didn't\nactually create the file?\n\n714\n00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,490\nBecause it viewed as file\nthat was already created.\n\n715\n00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,510\nThe case doesn't matter.\n\n716\n00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,270\nBut, if you wanna be truly\nPOSIX compliant, and\n\n717\n00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,690\nif you wanna operate a true Unix way,\ncase does matter.\n\n718\n00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,530\nAnd so if you're trying to adhere to that,\nwhich most people don't care.\n\n719\n00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,000\nRight?\nMost people don't worry about that.\n\n720\n00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,960\nBut if you do,\n\n721\n00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,320\nif you need to adhere to that,\nyou need to do the case sensitive one.\n\n722\n00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:50,250\nAnd if I switch over to that drive,\nall right,\n\n723\n00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,600\nso here I am on the case\nsensitive journal drive.\n\n724\n00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:00,660\nIf I do touch resume.txt,\ntouch Resume.txt with a capital r.\n\n725\n00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,280\nIf I do all capital.\n\n726\n00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,950\nSo I just ran those three\ndifferent touch commands, and\n\n727\n00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,630\nwhen I pull up my directory listing I\ncan see, I've got three different files.\n\n728\n00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,630\nThey have the same name but\nthere casing is different.\n\n729\n00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,980\nAnd in the true Unix specifications.\n\n730\n00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,540\nBack in the day,\nthat meant they were different files.\n\n731\n00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,130\nAll right.\n\n732\n00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,930\nSo you may need that if you're trying\nto maintain compatibility with some\n\n733\n00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,870\nother system.\n\n734\n00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,910\nOr if you've got areas where you have\nmultiple files with the same name,\n\n735\n00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,890\nthat's what the case\nsensitivity is all about.\n\n736\n00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:32,590\nAll right.\n\n737\n00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,070\nFor most of us though, we don't care\nabout that and we don't use it.\n\n738\n00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:40,517\nAnd as a result on a Mac, your default\nfilesystem, if you have to pick one,\n\n739\n00:39:40,517 --> 00:39:43,201\nthe one that gives you\nthe best feature set and\n\n740\n00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:46,610\nfunctionality is to choose\nthe Mac OS extended journal.\n\n741\n00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,810\nThat's the default when\nyou install Mac OS.\n\n742\n00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,630\nAnd when you format drives that's\nwhat it'll normally default to.\n\n743\n00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,031\nBut that doesn't give you that\nWindows compatibility, so\n\n744\n00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:56,380\nyou might need to choose others.\n\n745\n00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,890\nThose are the file systems that\nare called out on the exam.\n\n746\n00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,320\nI think they mention one\nother one which is NTFS.\n\n747\n00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,285\nSo, let me talk about that a little bit.\n\n748\n00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:06,496\nNTFS is the New Technology File System,\n\n749\n00:40:06,496 --> 00:40:11,080\nand it's a file system developed by\nMicrosoft for Windows NT, originally.\n\n750\n00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:16,020\nBut it's what Windows XP, Vista,\nWindows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10,\n\n751\n00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,140\nit's what they all use.\n\n752\n00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,870\nThey use this NTFS file system.\n\n753\n00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:22,880\nAnd NTFS is a good file system,\nvery stable, it's not fragile like FAT32.\n\n754\n00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,690\nIt's got file permissions,\na lot of good stuff about it.\n\n755\n00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:30,890\nBut it's Microsoft proprietary, and\nthey will not share it with anyone.\n\n756\n00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:37,780\nSo, Apple devices can read NTFS drives,\nbut they can't write to them.\n\n757\n00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,800\nAnd I've got one.\n\n758\n00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800\nI'm doing bootcamp.\n\n759\n00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,920\nSo, if I look on my desktop here.\n\n760\n00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,630\nI've got my Windows HD right here.\n\n761\n00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,240\nThat Windows hard drive is in NTFS.\n\n762\n00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,570\nIf I pull up its information.\n\n763\n00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,990\nIf I right click on it and\nchoose get info or get Cmd + I.\n\n764\n00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,942\nIn the information for the drive, it'll\ntell me in here somewhere, right here,\n\n765\n00:40:54,942 --> 00:40:56,330\nWindows empty file system.\n\n766\n00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:00,520\nSo, if it's NTFS, and\nmy Mac recognizes it.\n\n767\n00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,970\nAnd if I browse into it,\nI can see my files.\n\n768\n00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,744\nSo, I can browse right in here and\nlook at the files that are on that drive.\n\n769\n00:41:07,744 --> 00:41:10,160\nBut, it's read-only.\n\n770\n00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,470\nRemember, how I said with the Apple\ndrivers, a Window's machine can\n\n771\n00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,670\nread Mac OS Extended drives but\nit can't write to them.\n\n772\n00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,960\nThe opposite is true for NTFS.\n\n773\n00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,560\nApple can read NTFS drives but\nit can't write to them.\n\n774\n00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,560\nIf I try and create some new file or\njust rename a file.\n\n775\n00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:32,460\nI don't even have the option to rename\nit because we can't write to this disc.\n\n776\n00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,310\nIt's read-only.\n\n777\n00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:37,400\nSo, NTFS doesn't even show\nup in the disc utility.\n\n778\n00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,910\nI can't format a drive out of NTFS\nbecause I can't write to those.\n\n779\n00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,060\nSo, that is another file system\nthat you may encounter out there.\n\n780\n00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,010\nSo [COUGH], several different\nfile systems are available.\n\n781\n00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,460\nYou basically pick and choose the ones\nthat you want that meets your needs.\n\n782\n00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,660\nBut most of the time, it's just\ngonna be Mac OS Extended Journaled.\n\n783\n00:41:57,358 --> 00:41:59,680\nNow, one other thing worth mentioning.\n\n784\n00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,710\nI don't want to spend a ton of time on it,\nbut I do wanna cover it briefly,\n\n785\n00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:07,940\nwhen we partition that drive out, it had\nto keep track of what partitions existed.\n\n786\n00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,640\nAnd it keeps track of those\nthrough a partition table.\n\n787\n00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,810\nIn the Apple world,\n\n788\n00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:15,765\nthere's three different types of partition\ntables that are worth remembering.\n\n789\n00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:21,576\nThe old one is the APM, or\nthe Apple Partition Map.\n\n790\n00:42:21,576 --> 00:42:24,655\nAPM is what power PC Apples use.\n\n791\n00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:28,155\nSo, if you had a Mac back in the day where\nthey had power PC processors in them,\n\n792\n00:42:28,155 --> 00:42:31,135\nthen you were likely using\nthe Apple Partition Map.\n\n793\n00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:34,345\nYour drive would map out\nits partitions in this\n\n794\n00:42:34,345 --> 00:42:37,385\nproprietary Apple format that really\nwasn't compatible with anybody else.\n\n795\n00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,880\nIn the Microsoft world,\nin the Windows world,\n\n796\n00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,620\nthere's a partition table called the MBR,\nthe Master Boot Record.\n\n797\n00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,522\nAnd a lot of Linux systems and\nMicrosoft systems use this.\n\n798\n00:42:49,522 --> 00:42:54,790\nApple will read MBR, but\nit doesn't usually use MBR on its own.\n\n799\n00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:57,770\nI say, usually, it can,\nit's just not the best.\n\n800\n00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,690\nSo, MBR is Master Boot Recordand\nthat's another way.\n\n801\n00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:04,070\nMBR has some limitations like\nonly four partitions per disk\n\n802\n00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,050\nversus the sixteen that we saw earlier.\n\n803\n00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,270\nNow, how did we get sixteen earlier?\n\n804\n00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:12,880\nWell, most systems,\nWindows, Linux, and MAC,\n\n805\n00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,520\nhave all switched to a new type of\na partition table and it's called GPT.\n\n806\n00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,090\nAnd GPT actually stands for\nGUID Partition Table.\n\n807\n00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:27,440\nAnd GUID stands for\nGlobally Unique Identifier.\n\n808\n00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,598\nSo, it's the globally unique\nidentifier partition table and\n\n809\n00:43:31,598 --> 00:43:35,757\nyou'll see it on the exam\nreferenced as G-U-I-D or guid, or\n\n810\n00:43:35,757 --> 00:43:40,243\nyou'll see it referenced as GPT\nwhich is the GUID partition table.\n\n811\n00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:43,576\nSo, you'll see one of those two names for\nthe same technology.\n\n812\n00:43:43,576 --> 00:43:47,475\nGPT is used by all Macs today.\n\n813\n00:43:47,475 --> 00:43:50,385\nSo, if you buy a new Mac, it's using GPT.\n\n814\n00:43:50,385 --> 00:43:52,826\nIf you buy a new Windows machine,\nit's using GPT.\n\n815\n00:43:52,826 --> 00:43:54,826\nIf you buy a new Linux machine,\nit's using GPT.\n\n816\n00:43:54,826 --> 00:43:57,965\nAll the vendors have kinda\nstandardized on this new format.\n\n817\n00:43:57,965 --> 00:44:01,565\nMost system bios have switched\nto something called EFI, and\n\n818\n00:44:01,565 --> 00:44:05,315\nEFI bios loves GPT,\nthat's what it relies on.\n\n819\n00:44:05,315 --> 00:44:08,405\nAnd so, APM is pretty much dead,\nit's gone away,\n\n820\n00:44:08,405 --> 00:44:12,550\nyou really don't see APM anymore unless\nyou have a really old Mac laying around.\n\n821\n00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,500\nMBR is going away.\n\n822\n00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,660\nYou do still see it in the Windows\nworld sometimes, but for\n\n823\n00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,570\nthe most part, MBR is gone.\n\n824\n00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,440\nGPT is the one that we deal with.\n\n825\n00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,170\nSo, when we go in to partition that drive,\nand we can create 16 partitions,\n\n826\n00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:28,240\nwhat it's doing is it's writing all\nof that to the GUID partition table.\n\n827\n00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,230\nEach partition gets a global unique ID,\nand it gets logged into this table.\n\n828\n00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,850\nWhen your system boots up it says,\n\n829\n00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:37,230\nall right, show me everybody\nthat's in the table, who's there?\n\n830\n00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,990\nLet me find one that is a system disk.\n\n831\n00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,390\nWho's got Mac OS on?\n\n832\n00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:43,170\nThat's the one,\nI'm gonna boot from that one.\n\n833\n00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,530\nOr if the end user hold the alt key\nwhile they boot, they get to pick.\n\n834\n00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,520\nShow me all the partitions,let me\npick which one I wanna boot off of.\n\n835\n00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,965\nThat's whats happening when\nyou boot the system up.\n\n836\n00:44:52,965 --> 00:44:55,243\nSo, on the exam,\nyou may see mention of those.\n\n837\n00:44:55,243 --> 00:44:58,201\nAPM, Apple Partition Map,\nthat's the old one.\n\n838\n00:44:58,201 --> 00:44:59,035\nIt's gone.\n\n839\n00:44:59,035 --> 00:45:03,190\nMBR is Master Boot Record,\nthat's the old one for the Windows world.\n\n840\n00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,490\nPretty much gone.\n\n841\n00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,160\nAnd then GPT, the GUID Partition Table.\n\n842\n00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,070\nThat's Global Unique Identifier.\n\n843\n00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,040\nThat's the new one.\n\n844\n00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,610\nThat's pretty much what everybody does.\n\n845\n00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,590\nSo, when I'm manipulating those\npartitions in disk utility,\n\n846\n00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,330\nI'm really working with GPT.\n\n847\n00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,140\nWell, that's a pretty good spot for\nus to stop and take a break.\n\n848\n00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,600\nWe do have more on file\nsystems that we need to cover.\n\n849\n00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,670\nI wanna talk about how to troubleshoot and\nrepair damaged file systems,\n\n850\n00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,980\ncuz that does happen.\n\n851\n00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,660\nIt seems like there's something\nelse I wanna mention.\n\n852\n00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:34,490\nI know we need to tackle\ndoing basic recovery, so\n\n853\n00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,210\nwe'll get a chance to see that.\n\n854\n00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,430\nActually, I think that might be about it.\n\n855\n00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,350\nOh, target mode.\n\n856\n00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:43,230\nI wanna show target mode cuz it's super\ncool and it's something I like to do.\n\n857\n00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,320\nSo, we'll tackle that too,\nall after the break.\n\n858\n00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,160\nSo stay tuned.\n\n859\n00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,743\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n860\n00:45:48,743 --> 00:45:52,816\n[SOUND] Welcome\n\n861\n00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:57,911\nback everybody.\n\n862\n00:45:57,911 --> 00:45:59,579\nSo, in the first couple of segments,\n\n863\n00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:03,200\nwe talked about how discs work when things\nare going the way they're supposed to.\n\n864\n00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,770\nIn this last segment, I wanna talk about\nhow things go when things go wrong.\n\n865\n00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,420\nI mentioned how fragile FAT32 can be.\n\n866\n00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,770\nAnd if we improperly disconnect the drive,\nhow we can have some problems there.\n\n867\n00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:18,450\nI wanna show you how you can fix that, and\ntry and get past those types of problems.\n\n868\n00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:20,600\nThere's various reasons\nwe might need to do that.\n\n869\n00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,760\nWell, first off,\n\n870\n00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,550\nlet's just see an example of how things\nare supposed to properly happen.\n\n871\n00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:28,160\nIf you have removable media,\nwhen you take it out of a computer,\n\n872\n00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,460\nyou need to properly eject it first.\n\n873\n00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,760\nAnd there are several different\nways to properly eject.\n\n874\n00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,670\nI think in the objectives,\nthey specifically cite three, so\n\n875\n00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:37,040\nlet's look at the three\nthat they're talking about.\n\n876\n00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,280\nIf I have drives,\nlike here I've got my FAT32, or exFAT, or\n\n877\n00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,950\nI've got all these hard drives here.\n\n878\n00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:45,800\nIf I want to eject one of these,\nthere's several ways I can go about that.\n\n879\n00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,400\nMethod number one is if I go into the\nfinder, I can come here into the finder,\n\n880\n00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,060\nI can find the drive, and there's a little\neject button here there beside it and\n\n881\n00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,490\nI can that and it'll eject it.\n\n882\n00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:59,869\nNow, if it's one partition,\none volume, one partition,\n\n883\n00:46:59,869 --> 00:47:03,326\none drive, It'll just eject\nthe whole thing and that's it.\n\n884\n00:47:03,326 --> 00:47:07,130\nIn my case, I've got more than one\nvolume on the same physical hard drive.\n\n885\n00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:09,160\nSo, when I eject it,\nit's gonna warn me about that.\n\n886\n00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,410\nIt's gonna say, there's four partitions.\n\n887\n00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:14,600\nDo I want to eject them all or\njust this one?\n\n888\n00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:19,030\nI can choose to eject just the FAT32 one.\n\n889\n00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,170\nAnd it'll eject.\n\n890\n00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,000\nAnd that's it.\n\n891\n00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,810\nIt's gone.\nThe others are still mounted.\n\n892\n00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:27,290\nSo, you can eject them all, or\nyou can pick and choose amongst them.\n\n893\n00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:28,970\nThat's one method to eject a drive.\n\n894\n00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,430\nIf I go to my exFAT drive and\nI want to eject it.\n\n895\n00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,090\nMy number two method is,\n\n896\n00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:39,500\nyou come in here, you highlight\nthe drive that you want to eject.\n\n897\n00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,020\nAnd you go up to file, and you'll see\neject right there under the file menu.\n\n898\n00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,429\nSo, there's method number two.\n\n899\n00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:50,790\nSo, I can go here and\neject exFAT, and I'll eject it.\n\n900\n00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:54,674\nMethod number three,\nWould be probably one of the easiest,\n\n901\n00:47:54,674 --> 00:47:59,000\nwhich is to just drag the drive,\nand drop it right on your trash.\n\n902\n00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,410\nSo, I think my head is\non top of the trash.\n\n903\n00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:03,420\nLet me full screen the computer here.\n\n904\n00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,930\nBasically, you just take the drive and\nyou drag it down to your dock.\n\n905\n00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:09,220\nAnd see how when I drag a drive,\nthe recycle bin or\n\n906\n00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,680\ntrash, changes from a trash\ncan to an eject button, right?\n\n907\n00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,110\nIf I let go of that drive, and go down\nthere, I've got a nice little trash can.\n\n908\n00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:19,020\nIf I drag the drive down,\nit becomes an eject button.\n\n909\n00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:24,290\nAnd when I hit that, it's going to eject\nit, and that'll eject that disk also.\n\n910\n00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:28,260\nSo those are the three ways they\ncall out in the objectives.\n\n911\n00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,470\nThere are other ways.\n\n912\n00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:34,360\nYou can drop down to the terminal and\nyou can use the unmount command in Unix.\n\n913\n00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,490\nThat's one way that you can go in and\neject it.\n\n914\n00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:37,940\nAnother way is in the disk utility.\n\n915\n00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,160\nYou guys probably saw\nthat earlier in the show.\n\n916\n00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,970\nWhen I was in the disk utility,\nyou can pick any of these disks and\n\n917\n00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,830\nyou've got an eject button right there.\n\n918\n00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,110\nSo you can eject it\nyou're going to detact.\n\n919\n00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:51,850\nYou even got an unmount button if\njust want to unmount a single volume,\n\n920\n00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:52,570\nyou can do that too.\n\n921\n00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:54,300\nSo you've got different choices there.\n\n922\n00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:00,210\nBe aware though, that you can\nimproperly disconnect the drive and\n\n923\n00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:03,270\nit'll complain,\nit'll tell you there's a problem.\n\n924\n00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:06,580\nImproper disk connects are usually\nthe result of one of two things.\n\n925\n00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:09,500\nThe first thing is, you just yank\nthe drive out of the computer.\n\n926\n00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,620\nI just unplugged it and walked away.\n\n927\n00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,390\nAnd the Mac OS journal file system will\nsurvive that for the most part, but\n\n928\n00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,180\nyou might lose any changes\nthat were being written to it.\n\n929\n00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,260\nFAT 32, exFAT will normally\nget some disk corruption.\n\n930\n00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:25,140\nThe second cause of improper removal\n\n931\n00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,840\nis usually because we\nhave files that are open.\n\n932\n00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,650\nIf you've got files that\nare open on a disk and\n\n933\n00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,490\nit won't be able to eject, they'll\ntell you the disk is in use, right.\n\n934\n00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:35,010\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n935\n00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:37,870\nI've got this one last partition\nhere I haven't ejected.\n\n936\n00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:43,370\nAll right, if I go and\ntry to eject it, it's going to tell me\n\n937\n00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:47,780\nit can't be ejected because it's in use,\nIt's in use by the terminal program.\n\n938\n00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,980\nRemember I created my resume on that disk.\n\n939\n00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,290\nSo there's my resume.\n\n940\n00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:56,490\nAnd if I go back to my terminal window,\nyep, I'm still editing that file.\n\n941\n00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:59,420\nSo the file is in use and\nI can't eject it.\n\n942\n00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,590\nIt won't let me knock that guy out, right.\n\n943\n00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:06,510\nSo it's telling me I need to quit\nthe application and get it out of there.\n\n944\n00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,510\nAll right now, if I really\nreally want to eject it, we can.\n\n945\n00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,870\nWe can go to the disk utility and\nwe can force eject it, and\n\n946\n00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:16,930\nthat's gonna make us lose some changes,\nso that's not necessarily what we want.\n\n947\n00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,280\nIdeally, we would quite the application\nand that would take care of it.\n\n948\n00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,380\nAnd we'd see that regardless of\nwhich way we went to eject it.\n\n949\n00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,270\nIt's gonna tell us that\napplication is holding it in use.\n\n950\n00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:31,390\nAll right,\nnow if I just yank this drive out, so\n\n951\n00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:36,460\nI just unplugged it, I didn't properly\nremove it, I was editing that file,\n\n952\n00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,390\nand if I go back to my terminal window,\n\n953\n00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,780\nthe terminal is still sitting there\nrunning it so it thinks that it's okay,\n\n954\n00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:48,510\nbut if I try and save the file,\ncan't open the file for writing.\n\n955\n00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:53,020\nSo, I've got a problem there and\nif I try and\n\n956\n00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:56,310\nbrowse, I'm getting these no such file or\ndirectory.\n\n957\n00:50:56,310 --> 00:51:01,035\nI'm in the right path, but\nI can't navigate around,\n\n958\n00:51:01,035 --> 00:51:03,195\nI can't even change out of that directory.\n\n959\n00:51:03,195 --> 00:51:05,695\nThings are now not working quite right,\nokay?\n\n960\n00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,365\nAnd that's just because I\nimproperly disconnected it.\n\n961\n00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:11,890\nNow it didn't really complain much because\nof the way that disk was formatted.\n\n962\n00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:15,900\nAnd if I plug it back in,\nit's probably gonna be just fine,\n\n963\n00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,650\nlet's see if I can generate\nsomething a little more tragic.\n\n964\n00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:24,170\nThere we go, it's starting to ream out,\nI'm gonna go into the FAT32 partition,\n\n965\n00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:28,500\ncuz it's the most fragile,\nand I'm gonna edit a file,\n\n966\n00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:35,880\nwe'll call this one my new resume.txt,\nand we'll just, whoops.\n\n967\n00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:37,883\nPut in some text.\n\n968\n00:51:40,728 --> 00:51:43,050\nThis is exciting, I know.\n\n969\n00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:47,680\nSo we'll just put some data in here,\nand I'm gonna save it.\n\n970\n00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,690\nOkay, so I've got some data in there,\nit's in the file.\n\n971\n00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:52,470\nIt's right there, right?\n\n972\n00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:54,610\nThings should be pretty good and\nit's a pretty small file.\n\n973\n00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:57,940\nThere we go.\n\n974\n00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,230\nSo I can see my new resume.text\nsitting right there.\n\n975\n00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:06,430\nNow, if I'm working with that file,\nif I go to edit it and\n\n976\n00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:10,950\nI'm in the process of making changes and\nsaving and so on, so\n\n977\n00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:15,230\nif I go in here and\nI start to add in more data, so\n\n978\n00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:19,780\nI'm just adding in more,\nif I unplug while it's saving,\n\n979\n00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,580\nwhile it's writing to the disk,\nI can end up with some real problems.\n\n980\n00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,110\nI'm gonna try to time this, I probably\nwon't get it right but we'll see.\n\n981\n00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:30,921\nI'm gonna save this right as I yank it\nout, and actually I'm starting to get\n\n982\n00:52:30,921 --> 00:52:35,821\nsome swap file errors there, so let's\nsee how this goes as we give that a run.\n\n983\n00:52:38,282 --> 00:52:40,221\nAnd now it's starting to crap out on me.\n\n984\n00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:43,470\nAll right, so it couldn't save it.\n\n985\n00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:46,270\nAnd now I'm starting to get\nthose invalid connectors.\n\n986\n00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,200\nI didn't get my warning.\n\n987\n00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,480\nNormally, you get a little pop up box that\nsays the drive was improperly removed,\n\n988\n00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,970\nI just yanked it out, right?\n\n989\n00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,690\nSo we get a little gray warning box up\nhere towards our notification center.\n\n990\n00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:56,610\nI didn't get that.\n\n991\n00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:59,710\nBut it was improperly removed,\nI just yanked it out of there.\n\n992\n00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,560\nThere might be disruption at this point.\n\n993\n00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,980\nSo if I'm worried about disruption or\n\n994\n00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,610\nif it has happened I'm probably\ngoing to need to correct that.\n\n995\n00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:12,075\nWhen you plug the disk back in, the\neasiest way to spot disk corruption is you\n\n996\n00:53:12,075 --> 00:53:16,065\nplug it in, and\nthe volumes don't show up, all right?\n\n997\n00:53:16,065 --> 00:53:17,265\nNotice when I plugged it in.\n\n998\n00:53:17,265 --> 00:53:18,635\nOh, now they all showed up.\n\n999\n00:53:18,635 --> 00:53:20,585\nWell, that's not as\nexciting as I was hoping.\n\n1000\n00:53:20,585 --> 00:53:25,300\nWhat'll happen a lot of times, is you'll\nget where your Mac OS ones will show up.\n\n1001\n00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,620\nAnd then the exFAT or FAT32 won't show up.\n\n1002\n00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,290\nThey won't mount because\ncorruption has occurred.\n\n1003\n00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,560\nAlright, and\nthat's when panic starts to set in.\n\n1004\n00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,140\nYou get that sinking feeling in your\ngut and you're like, oh my gosh,\n\n1005\n00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,750\nI just lost my data, right?\n\n1006\n00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,830\nBut don't freak out.\n\n1007\n00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,690\nWe can usually repair and\nrecover the data.\n\n1008\n00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:45,190\nIt's just not able to be mounted\nthe way it is right now then.\n\n1009\n00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:47,760\nI guess maybe if I found like\na larger file and copied it in there.\n\n1010\n00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,780\nI'm sure I've got.\n\n1011\n00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:53,210\nHere I'll copy like my installer files,\nthey might be to big.\n\n1012\n00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,238\nThis is were we start bumping\ninto problems with FAT and exFAT.\n\n1013\n00:53:57,238 --> 00:53:59,020\nWell, exFAT can handle larger files.\n\n1014\n00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:03,530\nSo if I take something like\nmy Yosemite install here and\n\n1015\n00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:06,250\nI'll take that over to exFAT and\nI'll start to write it in there.\n\n1016\n00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,130\nSo it's starting to copy,\n\n1017\n00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:10,560\nthis is a pretty big file so it's going\nto take a little while to run right.\n\n1018\n00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,100\nIt's 5 gigs in size.\n\n1019\n00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,220\nSo it's gonna move along and\nstart doing that.\n\n1020\n00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:21,540\nLet me see if I can find some other\nprogram that's not too terribly small.\n\n1021\n00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,800\nThat's kind of the thing is I\nneed a medium size program.\n\n1022\n00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,000\nThis one's pretty good.\n\n1023\n00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,840\nI'll copy this one to the FAT drive,\nand we'll get that one going and\n\n1024\n00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,300\nthen I'll yank the drive out\nwhile it's copying those.\n\n1025\n00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,800\nSo there it goes.\n\n1026\n00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,210\nIs copying over Firefox and\n\n1027\n00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:39,690\nthen I'm just going to wait until a little\nbit of data goes and then I'll unplug it.\n\n1028\n00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,730\nSo there, I've got some\noperations cannot be completed.\n\n1029\n00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,430\nIt failed to copy over, and\n\n1030\n00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:47,350\nbecause it was in mid copy it may\nhave introduced some disc corruption.\n\n1031\n00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,340\nWe'll see if it did.\n\n1032\n00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:52,370\nSo we'll go ahead and plug that back in.\n\n1033\n00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:53,450\nAnd let's what mounts.\n\n1034\n00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:56,640\nI'm just gonna watch my desktop here\nas it goes to remount the disc.\n\n1035\n00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,240\nNotice how the Mac OS\none's come up real fast?\n\n1036\n00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,510\nIt doesn't have to do a lot of checking\non them because they're healthy,\n\n1037\n00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:02,380\nthey've got their journal.\n\n1038\n00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,880\nIt just has look for\nincomplete rights and wipe them out.\n\n1039\n00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,890\nBut on the exFAT and FAT32,\nthose take a little bit longer.\n\n1040\n00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,160\nLooks like we are still healthy though.\n\n1041\n00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,140\nThey came up.\n\n1042\n00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,220\nEven though they've got these damaged\nfiles that aren't properly copied over.\n\n1043\n00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,610\nAll right, well I was hoping\nto generate an error there but\n\n1044\n00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:19,820\nwithout that we can still use\nthe Disk Utility to go in and check these.\n\n1045\n00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,370\nIn the disk utility, there's to options\nthat we wanna pay attention to.\n\n1046\n00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:27,850\nWe've got the ability to verify a disk\nwhich is how we can check it for errors.\n\n1047\n00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:30,230\nAnd then we've got\nthe ability to repair a disk,\n\n1048\n00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,620\nwhich is to fix the errors\nthat they have occurred.\n\n1049\n00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,990\nSo I'm going to go into\nmy disk utility and\n\n1050\n00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:39,130\nI'm worried that I might have gotten\ncorruption on these two disks.\n\n1051\n00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:42,270\nIt didn't show any, but\nwho knows, It could be there.\n\n1052\n00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:44,970\nSo you can choose,\nlike I'll choose the FAT32 disk, and\n\n1053\n00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,350\nI'll hit Verify Disk right here.\n\n1054\n00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:50,620\nNow notice those options don't show\nup when I choose the hard drive.\n\n1055\n00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:53,760\nI don't have Verify Disk, and that's\nbecause this is part of the filesystem.\n\n1056\n00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,020\nAnd filesystems are part of the volume.\n\n1057\n00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,869\nVolumes are on the partition, so\n\n1058\n00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:02,770\nI've got to highlight a partition before\nI'll have verify and repair disk.\n\n1059\n00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:07,540\nSo I'm gonna verify the FAT32 disk there\nit's scanning it looking for errors and\n\n1060\n00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,710\nit didn't find any.\n\n1061\n00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:13,000\nIf it had found any then it would\ntell me it needed to run a repair.\n\n1062\n00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,123\nI can still run a repair if I want but\nthere's just nothing for it to fix so\n\n1063\n00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:18,793\nit's gonna run real quick and\nthen that'll be the end of it.\n\n1064\n00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:20,080\nLet me try to X that one here.\n\n1065\n00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,300\nI'll run a verify on it, and\nit'll scan it for errors.\n\n1066\n00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,600\nAnd it says here the volume\nappears to be okay.\n\n1067\n00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,320\nSo again, it doesn't need it\nI can repair it if I want to.\n\n1068\n00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,060\nAnd those work for the Mac OS Extended.\n\n1069\n00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,890\nWe just don't normally have that problem,\nright?\n\n1070\n00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,630\nSo you can still come here,\nverify the disks, and repair them and\n\n1071\n00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,950\nget them fixed and off you go, all right.\n\n1072\n00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:41,900\nSo the disk utility is\npretty handy with that.\n\n1073\n00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,500\nWe can check our disks and\nfix the problems.\n\n1074\n00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,540\nNow if you are halfway through a write and\n\n1075\n00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:50,360\nyou got an interruption you've lost that\ndata, you were halfway through the write.\n\n1076\n00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,520\nThere's nothing you can do about that but\n\n1077\n00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,090\nif the partition table was damaged,\nif some file pointers were wrong,\n\n1078\n00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:58,650\nit can fix those and\nyou'll be able to access your data.\n\n1079\n00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:03,610\nAnd what will commonly happen is you won't\nbe able to see this volume in the finder,\n\n1080\n00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:04,535\nand then as soon as.\n\n1081\n00:57:04,535 --> 00:57:07,625\nAs you run the repair,\nit shows up in the finder again.\n\n1082\n00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:10,675\nSo you get that sinking feeling\nlike the whole drive is gone.\n\n1083\n00:57:10,675 --> 00:57:12,335\nThen you repair it, and it reappears, and\n\n1084\n00:57:12,335 --> 00:57:15,515\nyou've got access to\nthe bulk of your data.\n\n1085\n00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:20,085\nThe only time this doesn't work is if\nwe're talking about our system partition.\n\n1086\n00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:25,195\nThe Macintosh HD here,\nthat's where I booted my system off of.\n\n1087\n00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:29,340\nAnd if I've got a problem with that,\nI might not be able to boot up.\n\n1088\n00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,270\nAnd if I can't boot up,\nI can't get to disc utility, can I?\n\n1089\n00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:34,580\nWell if I've got my recovery partition,\nI can try from that but\n\n1090\n00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:38,520\nthe recovery partition is on\nthe same physical hard drive.\n\n1091\n00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,260\nSo it may have corruption also.\n\n1092\n00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,060\nAnd if that's the case,\nyou can have a real problem.\n\n1093\n00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,150\nHow do you repair your system partition?\n\n1094\n00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:50,920\nWell, one of the easiest ways to\ndo it is to use one of the coolest\n\n1095\n00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,730\nfeatures that MacOS has and I wish\nother operating systems had this but\n\n1096\n00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,960\nMacOS is the only one that really does it.\n\n1097\n00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,330\nOn any Mac computer,\nyou have what's called Target Mode.\n\n1098\n00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:03,680\nNormally when you boot up your computer,\n\n1099\n00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,090\nit expects to use its hard drive and\nbe a computer.\n\n1100\n00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:10,040\nBut when you put a Mac into Target Mode,\n\n1101\n00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:14,440\nit turns the Mac into a giant\nremovable hard drive, all right.\n\n1102\n00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:19,240\nSo if you can't boot your computer up,\nyou can instead boot it in target mode, so\n\n1103\n00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,190\nit's a hard drive and\nattach it to another Mac and\n\n1104\n00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:25,110\nyou can use that other Mac\nto repair your damaged disk.\n\n1105\n00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:28,150\nSo what I got is I got Daniel's Mac here.\n\n1106\n00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:30,940\nSo one of the other hosts\nI stole his computer.\n\n1107\n00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:34,080\nSo he's sitting over here longingly\nwondering you know what to do.\n\n1108\n00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,900\nAn IT guy without his computer.\n\n1109\n00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,720\nSo I've got his Mac right here, and\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna boot it in\n\n1110\n00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,080\nTarget Mode, and then I'll hook it up to\nmy Mac, and it'll show up as a hard drive.\n\n1111\n00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,990\nNow, booting into\nTarget Mode is really easy.\n\n1112\n00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:46,920\nAll you do, and\n\n1113\n00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,850\nI'm just gonna show you here in person,\nis you hold the letter T down.\n\n1114\n00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:52,790\nT for Target.\n\n1115\n00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:55,480\nYou hold the letter T down,\nwhile you press power.\n\n1116\n00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:59,440\nSo, I'm gonna hold the T and\nI'll hit the power button.\n\n1117\n00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,720\nNow, I'm still holding T and\nI'm waiting to see the Apple.\n\n1118\n00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,720\nOr, it may just go straight to it.\n\n1119\n00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,910\nIf you see the apple then,\nyou can let go of the T.\n\n1120\n00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,620\nBut, otherwise, it will just go\nstraight to a mode like this.\n\n1121\n00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:10,650\nWhen you're in Target mode,\n\n1122\n00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:15,480\nyou'll have a symbol that lets you\nknow what media type is supported.\n\n1123\n00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,000\nIt will either be Thunderbolt or FireWire.\n\n1124\n00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,510\nThis laptop doesn't have any FireWire,\n\n1125\n00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,080\nso Thunderbolt is the only\nthing that turns up.\n\n1126\n00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,420\nSo, I've got my little Thunderbolt icon.\n\n1127\n00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:25,470\nAnd then, beneath it is a little battery\nmeter, cuz I'm on battery power.\n\n1128\n00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,890\nSo I'm not going to have\nthis hard drive forever.\n\n1129\n00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,970\nI've got to get this done while\nI still have battery power.\n\n1130\n00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:35,760\nBut while we're in Target mode,\nall you have to do is connect.\n\n1131\n00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,320\nOh shoot I hit my microphone\nthat whole time didn't I?\n\n1132\n00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,590\nSorry about that guys.\n\n1133\n00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:45,360\nOnce you're in target mode, all you\nhave to do is hook up that FireWire or\n\n1134\n00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,320\nhook up that Thunderbolt cable and\nrun it to your other Mac.\n\n1135\n00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,440\nAnd so that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n1136\n00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,060\nI've got a little Thunderbolt cable\nright here and I'm just going to plug it\n\n1137\n00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:59,100\ninto Daniel's Mac, and then I'm going to\ntake the other end and plug it into mine.\n\n1138\n00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,910\nSo let's switch over to my Mac real quick\nand we'll see this kind of in action.\n\n1139\n01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:05,680\nWhen I plug it in,\na few things are going to happen.\n\n1140\n01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:10,600\nMy computer is going to see\nthat as a removable drive.\n\n1141\n01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,700\nI've already got my USB drive right there.\n\n1142\n01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,890\nThat one's showing up and\nI'm gonna give it a moment.\n\n1143\n01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:19,830\nIt will see Daniel's drive and it will\nturn up as another Apple hard drive.\n\n1144\n01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:22,140\nI'll sit here and\nI'll wait patiently for it to do that.\n\n1145\n01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:26,010\nLet me just make sure is going.\n\n1146\n01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,123\nApparently, it is taking it's time.\n\n1147\n01:00:29,415 --> 01:00:34,130\nIf it doesn't turn up, another thing is, I\nbooted this with out the cable connected.\n\n1148\n01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,910\nSo I might need to reboot\nit to get it to detect.\n\n1149\n01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,180\nYeah, it's not showing up right away.\n\n1150\n01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:40,130\nSo let me,\nI'm going to give it the old reboot.\n\n1151\n01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:44,380\nAnd we'll just repeat that process here\nwith the cable connected at boot time, so.\n\n1152\n01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:48,250\nTo turn it off when you're in target mode\nyou just hold down the power button.\n\n1153\n01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:51,040\nYou just hold it down for\nten seconds and then it'll turn off.\n\n1154\n01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,330\nSo I'm just gonna power that off and\nwe'll give it another power on here.\n\n1155\n01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:01,185\nAll right, now if he just has\na normal Mac OS journal partition,\n\n1156\n01:01:01,185 --> 01:01:04,790\ntt'll show up as another drive and\nI'll be able to run the disk repair on it.\n\n1157\n01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:05,720\nOh, there it goes, yep.\n\n1158\n01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,560\nThere's his drive, showing up right there,\nso I see his drive.\n\n1159\n01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,790\nHe's got a 250 gig SSD in his, and so\n\n1160\n01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:16,540\nit shows up right there, and there's his\nsystem partition that he boots from.\n\n1161\n01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:19,060\nI can run verify disk and repair,\nI'll go ahead and verify,\n\n1162\n01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,300\nand it's gonna check it for errors.\n\n1163\n01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:25,890\nIf his disk was encrypted, if he had\nFileVault turned on and it was encrypted.\n\n1164\n01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,660\nWell, it would prompt me for a key.\n\n1165\n01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,760\nI have to put in his password and\nso I have to go to Daniel.\n\n1166\n01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,150\nAnd say Daniel will you punch in your\npassword here so I can access your drive?\n\n1167\n01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:37,560\nYou can't repair an encrypted\ndrive without the key.\n\n1168\n01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,675\nSo be aware of for\nthat if it's got FileVault.\n\n1169\n01:01:39,675 --> 01:01:44,135\nHe doesn't have FileVault though, so it\nscanned it over and it says it looks okay.\n\n1170\n01:01:44,135 --> 01:01:44,645\nRight.\n\n1171\n01:01:44,645 --> 01:01:45,295\nIt looks okay.\n\n1172\n01:01:45,295 --> 01:01:48,175\nIf it wasn't, I'd be able to repair it or\nactually, it's not done,\n\n1173\n01:01:48,175 --> 01:01:49,925\nit's still checking a few\nother things there.\n\n1174\n01:01:49,925 --> 01:01:53,165\nSo it's scanning through and\ngetting that kind of figured out for us.\n\n1175\n01:01:53,165 --> 01:01:53,845\nAll right.\n\n1176\n01:01:53,845 --> 01:01:57,065\nNow if his Mac, if I was going to\nhave to send it in for repair,\n\n1177\n01:01:57,065 --> 01:01:59,740\nmaybe the display was dead and\nit wasn't working.\n\n1178\n01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:03,840\nI could hook it up this way and then,\nI see his hard drive right here.\n\n1179\n01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:08,680\nI could browse into it, grab the files\nthat I need, backup my information and\n\n1180\n01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,830\nnow it's ready to send the device\nback to Apple for repair.\n\n1181\n01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:14,370\nSo Target mode is really neat.\n\n1182\n01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:18,720\nYour monitor could be dead, your keyboard\ninputs are messed up, something like that.\n\n1183\n01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,350\nBut as long as you can hold that\nt key down while you boot up,\n\n1184\n01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:26,480\nit'll go into target mode and now you've\ngot a great big removable media device.\n\n1185\n01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,790\nNow I did have to reboot mine with\nthe cable connected to get it to show up.\n\n1186\n01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:33,500\nThat may happen for you, or you may be\nable to hook the cable up after the fact.\n\n1187\n01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,570\nIt just depends.\n\n1188\n01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,470\nI did it with Thunderbolt, but\nit works with FireWire also.\n\n1189\n01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:39,190\nIt does not work with USB.\n\n1190\n01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:39,980\nAll right?\n\n1191\n01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:42,180\nTarget mode does not have USB support.\n\n1192\n01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:45,180\nAnd that's because USB is not really\ndesigned to have a host to host\n\n1193\n01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:46,330\ncable like this.\n\n1194\n01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:47,620\nThunderbolt and FireWire can.\n\n1195\n01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:49,990\nAll right.\n\n1196\n01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:53,610\nSo, those are some of the things we\nneed to be aware of when file systems\n\n1197\n01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:56,360\naren't behaving the way\nthat they're supposed to.\n\n1198\n01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,360\nPretty straight forward, the disc\nutility can fix most of what we've got.\n\n1199\n01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:02,500\nAll right.\nRemember that all of this\n\n1200\n01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,410\nis not a substitute for having a backup.\n\n1201\n01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:06,750\nMake sure you use Time Machine or\n\n1202\n01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,790\nsome other system to back up\nyour data to an external drive.\n\n1203\n01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:14,380\nThat's the best scenario for being able to\nrecover your data and keep your data safe.\n\n1204\n01:03:15,452 --> 01:03:18,880\nAll right well that's a pretty good\nstop for us to wrap up this episode.\n\n1205\n01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,590\nIn this episode we covered\na lot of topics right.\n\n1206\n01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:25,170\nWe started talking about file systems in\ngeneral we took a look at how the Macs\n\n1207\n01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:28,310\nhandle hard drives,\npartitions and volumes.\n\n1208\n01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:31,090\nWe talked about the file systems\nthat we could put on there like\n\n1209\n01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:35,740\nthe Mac OS extended file system\nas well as NTFS, FAT32 and Expat.\n\n1210\n01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:38,230\nAnd we took a look at some of the problems\n\n1211\n01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:40,030\nin recovery tools that\nwe've got available.\n\n1212\n01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:43,860\nSome good stuff there,\nall really handy for maintaining your Mac.\n\n1213\n01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:48,120\nAll right, well that's about it for\nour show today and I do want to\n\n1214\n01:03:48,120 -->

evening.\n\n4\n00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,868\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:41,365\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n6\n00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:46,143\nback again with another episode of Apple\nCertified Support Professional, ACSP.\n\n7\n00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:49,790\nWe are going to pick up where we left off\nin the last episode which was looking at\n\n8\n00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,048\nfile systems, only we're going to\nchange gears a little bit today,\n\n9\n00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:55,520\nbecause we are talking\nabout file security.\n\n10\n00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,700\nWe've got more file security that's going\nto come up in the next episode, but for\n\n11\n00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,850\nthis episode I want to\nfocus on encryption and\n\n12\n00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,990\nsecuring your files so\nthat other people can't get at them.\n\n13\n00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,760\nAnd there's several different attacks that\npeople can take if they want to try and\n\n14\n00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,880\nget at your files.\n\n15\n00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,930\nSo there's a few different approaches\nwe can take to protecting ourselves.\n\n16\n00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,012\nSo that's what we're gonna look at in this\nthis episode as we move through with ACSP.\n\n17\n00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:22,230\nAll right well, I wanna kick off\nthe show talking about FileVault.\n\n18\n00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,890\nI know I mentioned FileVault in\nsome of the other episodes, but\n\n19\n00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,460\nwe haven't actually seen it\nimplemented and put into use.\n\n20\n00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,612\nAnd so I wanna take a look at that,\nand so I wanna begin,\n\n21\n00:01:31,612 --> 00:01:33,407\nwith the original FileVault.\n\n22\n00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:38,900\nIf you install Mac OS Yosemite, right,\n10.10 or 10.9 or 10.9 whatever.\n\n23\n00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:45,075\nIf you install any of the newer Mac OSs,\nyou're running what's called FileVault 2.\n\n24\n00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:48,770\nAnd FileVault 2 provides\nwhole disk encryption.\n\n25\n00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,840\nIt encrypts your entire hard drive.\n\n26\n00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,910\nAnd that is the best solution for\nprotecting your data.\n\n27\n00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,170\nThe original version of FileVault though,\ndidn't do that.\n\n28\n00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,570\nBack in the,\nback in the olden days, right?\n\n29\n00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,370\nWe had the original FileVault.\n\n30\n00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,650\nAnd the original FileVault just\nencrypted your home directory.\n\n31\n00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,600\nAnd that's it.\n\n32\n00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,660\nIt didn't' encrypt any other part of\nthe hard drive, just your home directory.\n\n33\n00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,225\nNow back then,\nit was just called FileVault.\n\n34\n00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,190\nBut today, and\nwhat you'll see on the exam,\n\n35\n00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,220\nis that the original FileVault\nis called legacy FileVault.\n\n36\n00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,980\nThat's the old one.\n\n37\n00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,900\nAnd the new one is FileVault version 2.\n\n38\n00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,040\nBut on the exam they really\nwon't call it version 2.\n\n39\n00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,990\nWhen they say FileVault,\nthey're talking about Version 2.\n\n40\n00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:39,330\nWhen they say Legacy FileVault, they're\ntalking about Version 1, all right?\n\n41\n00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,180\nNow, why one approach over the other?\n\n42\n00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,970\nWell the original idea,\nthe original idea behind FileVault,\n\n43\n00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,360\nwas the each user could\nmake their own decision.\n\n44\n00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,030\nThey could to say, do I want to\nencrypt my home directory, or not?\n\n45\n00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,400\nAnd you might have some users\non your computer that do, and\n\n46\n00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,310\nsome users that don't, and that's it.\n\n47\n00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,270\nSo if I share my computer with four other\npeople, maybe two or three of us decide to\n\n48\n00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,490\nencrypt our home directories,\nand the other two people don't.\n\n49\n00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,680\nYou could do that with\nthe Legacy FileVault, with the original.\n\n50\n00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,520\nAnd it would encrypt your home folder.\n\n51\n00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,440\nBut there were a couple\nof problems with this.\n\n52\n00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,230\nThe main problem is that Some users\nare really good about saving all of their\n\n53\n00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,180\ndata in their home directory and\nso all their data was saved.\n\n54\n00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,780\nBut if a user saved their data\noutside of the home directory for\n\n55\n00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,330\nsome reason,\nas an administrator often can,\n\n56\n00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,120\nthe data wouldn't get encrypted and\npeople might not know that.\n\n57\n00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,490\nBecause FileVault for\nthe most part is invisible to the user.\n\n58\n00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,790\nOnce it's turned on they don't\nreally even notice that it's there.\n\n59\n00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,230\nSo that process is easy to forget about.\n\n60\n00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,290\nAnd now we save data\noutside of our directory,\n\n61\n00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,460\nit's not encrypted and if someone\nwas to get a hold of our computer,\n\n62\n00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,010\nthey could boot it in target mode,\nplug it into another Mac and they would\n\n63\n00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,120\nhave access to the entire file system\nexcept for our home directory, right?\n\n64\n00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,850\nSo at least that's safe.\n\n65\n00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,120\nIf your users are goo about saving\ntheir data in the home directory,\n\n66\n00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,330\nthe original file vault\nworked really well.\n\n67\n00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,190\nRight?\n\n68\n00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,250\nBut, it didn't give old disk encryption.\n\n69\n00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,240\nAnd so, there were problems,\n\n70\n00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,150\nthere were areas like the preferences\nfolder, the library folder,\n\n71\n00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,490\nthat are off the root of the drive,\nwhere applications store data.\n\n72\n00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,440\nAnd that data wasn't getting encrypted and\nit was still vulnerable.\n\n73\n00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,482\nSo Apple made the decision\nto redo FileVault.\n\n74\n00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:19,320\nIn FileVault version 2,\nthey said, you know what?\n\n75\n00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,020\nForget it.\nLet's\n\n76\n00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,190\njust forget this home\nuser directory stuff.\n\n77\n00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,510\nYou can't trust users to\ndo everything they need.\n\n78\n00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,840\nAnd the applications are unprotected.\n\n79\n00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,930\nSo instead, let's encrypt the whole drive.\n\n80\n00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,060\nAnd Apple's not the only\ncompany to decide this, right?\n\n81\n00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,500\nIt's been like this in Linux a long time.\n\n82\n00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,330\nMicrosoft Windows.\n\n83\n00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,300\nThey did it with BitLocker.\n\n84\n00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,210\nSame thing.\n\n85\n00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,550\nEncrypt the whole drive.\n\n86\n00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,730\nAnd that way,\nif somebody gets your computer and\n\n87\n00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,110\ntries to boot to Target Mode, they can't.\n\n88\n00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,210\nThey can't boot to Target Mode\nwithout your FileVault key, right?\n\n89\n00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,130\nOr a valid login.\n\n90\n00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,645\nIf they take your hard drive out, and\n\n91\n00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:51,475\nstick the hard drive\ninto another computer.\n\n92\n00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:53,235\nIt's entire encrypted.\n\n93\n00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:55,075\nAll of your applications,\nyour preferences,\n\n94\n00:04:55,075 --> 00:05:00,325\nyour library folder, your home directory,\nthe entire drive is secured.\n\n95\n00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:03,185\nSo, FileVault version 2,\nthe new FileVault?\n\n96\n00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:04,445\nThat's the one you want.\n\n97\n00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:05,175\nAlright?\n\n98\n00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:07,825\nLegacy FileVault, is not what you want.\n\n99\n00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:08,435\nAlright?\n\n100\n00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:13,630\nWell, if you install Yosemite, or\nMavericks, you can't do legacy file vault.\n\n101\n00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,430\nThe option's not even there,\nyou don't see it, so it's not a big deal.\n\n102\n00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,470\nBut what if you upgraded?\n\n103\n00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,840\nAnd that's what I want to\nkick off with right here.\n\n104\n00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,860\nIf you have a Mac that's older, so\nmaybe you've got Mac in the Leopard or\n\n105\n00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,270\nSnow Leopard days, and\nyou're running the legacy file vault, and\n\n106\n00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,830\nthen you upgrade Yosemite.\n\n107\n00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,670\nWell, you might still have legacy file\nvault, and Yosemite does support it.\n\n108\n00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,690\nIt'll read it and access it, it just\nwon't let you create it on your own.\n\n109\n00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,530\nAll right, let me show you what I mean.\n\n110\n00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,270\nSo I have, right here,\na Yosemite machine, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,710\nAnd I upgraded this all\nthe way from Leopard,\n\n112\n00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,360\nit was a lot of fun,\nyou guys should have seen it.\n\n113\n00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,700\nBut it's been upgraded all\nthe way from Snow Leopard.\n\n114\n00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,760\nSo, I've got my Snow Leopard background,\nbut if I go up here to About This Mac,\n\n115\n00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,221\nyou can see that I am running\n10.10.2 Yosemite, right?\n\n116\n00:06:08,221 --> 00:06:09,210\nSo I'm up to date.\n\n117\n00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,880\nAnd here I am, right.\n\n118\n00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,810\nWell, back under Snow Leopard,\nI turned on legacy File Vault, right,\n\n119\n00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,730\nso I encrypted my home directory.\n\n120\n00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,440\nI'm logged in as Don Poset and\nI encrypted my home directory.\n\n121\n00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,550\nThe whole drive is not encrypted,\njust my home directory.\n\n122\n00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,740\nAnd when I upgrade,\nYosemite was fine with that.\n\n123\n00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,470\nIt left it there.\n\n124\n00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:37,000\nWhen I go into system preferences,\nand I go to security and\n\n125\n00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,970\nprivacy right here, notice my tabs\nacross the top of the screen.\n\n126\n00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,500\nI've got, oops!\n\n127\n00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,850\nLet's get that out of the way.\n\n128\n00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:49,910\nI've got general, FileVault, legacy\nFileVault, firewall, and privacy, right?\n\n129\n00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,660\nSo I've got two FileVault tabs.\n\n130\n00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,450\nAnd that's file vault version two and\nfile vault version one, the legacy.\n\n131\n00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,530\nVersus if I look at a machine that wasn't\nupgraded, or that was newer right?\n\n132\n00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,880\nMy actual laptop right here that\nI use during the show, right?\n\n133\n00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,020\nSo this is my laptop.\n\n134\n00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,270\nAnd my laptop shipped with Maverix.\n\n135\n00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,454\nSo I had 10.9 and\nthen I upgraded to 10.10, right?\n\n136\n00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:15,270\nSo 10.9 was the oldest\nOS that I ran on this.\n\n137\n00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,720\nAnd if I go into my system preferences.\n\n138\n00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,540\nAnd I go into security and privacy.\n\n139\n00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,337\nWhen I go in here, I've got general,\nfile vault, firewall privacy,\n\n140\n00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:26,508\nI don't have the legacy file vault tab.\n\n141\n00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:31,177\nSo that will only show up if you upgrade\nit from an older system that had\n\n142\n00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:33,820\nlegacy file vault turned on.\n\n143\n00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,880\nIf \"legacy fire vault\" wasn't turned on,\nthen that won't show up either.\n\n144\n00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,232\nEven though you did the upgrade,\n\n145\n00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:40,945\nit won't show up because it wasn't\nturned on before the upgrade.\n\n146\n00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:45,416\nAll right here's no way to turn\non legacy file vault in Yosemite,\n\n147\n00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:49,250\nbut on this system I had it on before,\nand there it is.\n\n148\n00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,769\nAnd I've got a tab and you guys probably\nnotice the first thing that popped up here\n\n149\n00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:55,459\nwhen I went here was hey FileVault\nversion one is not so great,\n\n150\n00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:58,083\nyou should probably switch to\nsomething different right?\n\n151\n00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,921\nSo that's what it's telling me right here,\nyou're using an older version of\n\n152\n00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:06,300\nFile Vault that encrypts your home\ndirectory, great, but not the entire disk.\n\n153\n00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,530\nNot so great.\n\n154\n00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,980\nDo you want to keep using\nthe older File Vault?\n\n155\n00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,050\nYou can keep using it if you want to.\n\n156\n00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,900\nIt'll let you, right?\n\n157\n00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,100\nYosemite does support it.\n\n158\n00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,590\nYou can keep running it that way.\n\n159\n00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,330\nBut what they're telling you is,\nyou really should switch away, alright?\n\n160\n00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,920\nNow, the easiest way to tell if you're\nrunning legacy file vault is right here.\n\n161\n00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,370\nYou know, you just come into security and\npreferences.\n\n162\n00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,550\nAll right, you come into your system\npreferences, and go to security and\n\n163\n00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,520\nprivacy and you'll see it right there.\n\n164\n00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,890\nAnother good indicator is\nthe legacy file vault.\n\n165\n00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,740\nBecause it was just encrypting your home\ndirectory, every time you log out, it has\n\n166\n00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,990\nto re-encrypt your home directory, and so\nthere's this little screen that pops up.\n\n167\n00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,120\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n168\n00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,090\nActually, I probably need to\nmake some kind of a change.\n\n169\n00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,820\nLet me just copy some kind of\nfile like my desktop icon here.\n\n170\n00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,160\nI'll copy that into my documents.\n\n171\n00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,790\nI will try and\ncopy that into my documents.\n\n172\n00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,840\nApparently, it's gonna think.\n\n173\n00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,040\nWhen you start doing stacked\nupgrades like I did,\n\n174\n00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,070\nthe systems can get a little bit flaky.\n\n175\n00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,370\nBut when you copy things around,\n\n176\n00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,630\nit's having to deal with the file\nencryption and the FileVault itself, and\n\n177\n00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,820\nwhen you log out you'll actually see\na little pop out on the screen that\n\n178\n00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,080\nwill say that it's compressing or\nreorganizing your directories.\n\n179\n00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,980\nAnd what it's actually doing there is it's\nbasically re-encrypting that data, so\n\n180\n00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,440\nyou'll see that message\nwhen that comes up.\n\n181\n00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,290\nApparently, it's going to sit here and\nthink about it for a little while.\n\n182\n00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,620\nSo I'm just going to copy that.\n\n183\n00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,260\nI'll throw it somewhere else\nlike in my documents folder.\n\n184\n00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,540\nActually it is already in my\ndocuments folder, isn't it?\n\n185\n00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,210\nWell I'll just make a new folder.\n\n186\n00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,410\nThere we go, and\nI'll throw it in there, right.\n\n187\n00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:46,170\nSo now when I log out,\nI'll just log out of this system, and\n\n188\n00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,100\nwhen I log out,\nsee that file vault message right there?\n\n189\n00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,252\nYou don't see that with\nFileVault version 2.\n\n190\n00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:54,460\nWith FireVault version 1,\nit's re-encrypting my home directory,\n\n191\n00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,480\ncompressing that data down and\nencrypting it.\n\n192\n00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,660\nWith FileVault version 2, you don't.\n\n193\n00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,910\nSo if you see that pop up, that's another\ngood indicator that you're running.\n\n194\n00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,840\nThe legacy one, all right?\n\n195\n00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,240\nSo, if I wanna upgrade to FileVault\nversion 2, how do I do it?\n\n196\n00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,290\nWell, the basic process is pretty simple.\n\n197\n00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,620\nBasically you have to turn\noff Legacy FileVault.\n\n198\n00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,470\nYou turn it off and decrypt your data, and\n\n199\n00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:20,180\nthen you turn on FileVault version 2 and\nit will encrypt your entire hard drive.\n\n200\n00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,630\nSo that's what I'm gonna do here.\n\n201\n00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,710\nI'm gonna go through and\nturn off my Legacy FileVault and\n\n202\n00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,010\nonce that's off, then we can go about\nconfiguring FileVault version 2.\n\n203\n00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,040\nSo I'm gonna jump into my system\npreferences again, and I'll go right back\n\n204\n00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,730\ninto security and privacy, and\nI'll get my pop up message again.\n\n205\n00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,860\nThat's gonna come up every time unless\nI tell it not to show it to me again.\n\n206\n00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,050\nSo I always get that\nopportunity to see it here.\n\n207\n00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,470\nAnd I'll choose to turn\noff Legacy FileVault.\n\n208\n00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,400\nIf I don't do it here I can say,\nkeep using it.\n\n209\n00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,810\nAnd if I go to my Legacy FileVault tab,\nI've got,\n\n210\n00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,982\nturn off Legacy FileVault there, also.\n\n211\n00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:59,310\nAll right, so I'm going to go ahead and\nturn it off and get that set.\n\n212\n00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,870\nNow once I've turned it off it's going\nto decrypt my home directory and\n\n213\n00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,600\nthat can take a moment.\n\n214\n00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,690\nSee this little message\nright here where it says,\n\n215\n00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,870\nturning off Legacy FileVault\nmay take a while, right?\n\n216\n00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,710\nWell they're not lying.\n\n217\n00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,310\nIt can take a little while for\nit to decrypt that data.\n\n218\n00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,080\nAnd we normally,\n\n219\n00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,220\nsee a little status bar which\napparently it's not going to give me.\n\n220\n00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,080\nLet me see if I, no,\ndidn't stick it in the background.\n\n221\n00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,355\nLet me try this again.\n\n222\n00:11:22,355 --> 00:11:26,420\n[LAUGH] Maybe I punched\nin the wrong password.\n\n223\n00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,370\nTry that a second time.\n\n224\n00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,790\nThere we go.\n\n225\n00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,280\nSo it says, you are ready to turn\noff Legacy FileVault protection.\n\n226\n00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,520\nI'll go ahead and say turn it off.\n\n227\n00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,460\nAnd there we go.\n\n228\n00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,540\nThere's my little progress\nbar I was talking about.\n\n229\n00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,200\nThere it's decrypting my home directory.\n\n230\n00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,050\nAnd now Legacy FileVault is off, okay?\n\n231\n00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,550\nIf I have more than one user account,\nI need to do that for each user account.\n\n232\n00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,340\nI need to get each user to\nturn off Legacy FileVault.\n\n233\n00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,010\nAs soon as it's off,\nnotice the Legacy FileVault tab went away.\n\n234\n00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:57,910\nIt's gone now.\n\n235\n00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,490\nRight.\n\n236\n00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,140\nI don't have that option.\n\n237\n00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:05,040\nFrom here, I can proceed with\nturning on FileVault version 2,\n\n238\n00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,360\nas if Legacy FileVault never occurred,\nright?\n\n239\n00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,540\nThe upgrade process,\nIf we wanna upgrade from Legacy to new,\n\n240\n00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,280\nturn off Legacy FileVault for\neach user that's using it.\n\n241\n00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,360\nAnd once it's off for all of them,\n\n242\n00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,840\nthen just proceed with turning\non the regular FileVault.\n\n243\n00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,650\nAll right,\nwell let me switch machines here.\n\n244\n00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,590\nI'm gonna switch back to\none that wasn't upgraded.\n\n245\n00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,900\nWhen you do a sequence of\nchained upgrade like this,\n\n246\n00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,050\nthe machine does a little clunky and slow.\n\n247\n00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,460\nI want to switch to a machine that hasn't\nbeen through a chain of upgrades, and\n\n248\n00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,460\nwhat we'll do is get a chance\nto see how to install and\n\n249\n00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,730\nget regular FileVault or FileVault\nversion 2 up and running on a new system.\n\n250\n00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,340\nIf you were doing an upgrade, this is\nthe next step, if you're doing an initial\n\n251\n00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,350\ninstall, this would be the first step,\nwhat we're about to see, all right?\n\n252\n00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,380\nLet's stop here and\ntake a quick break and when we get back,\n\n253\n00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,720\nwe're going to enable FileVault, and\nsecure the contents of our drive.\n\n254\n00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,429\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n255\n00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:04,227\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n256\n00:13:04,227 --> 00:13:05,635\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n257\n00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:09,105\nSo in this segment, what I wanna do is,\nI wanna take a Yosemite machine and\n\n258\n00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:12,575\nget FileVault configured on there for\nfull disk encryption.\n\n259\n00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,755\nNow if you're upgrading,\nyou do what we did in the first segment.\n\n260\n00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,425\nYou disable Legacy FileVault.\n\n261\n00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:20,300\nAnd then you pick up right\nhere with the upgrade, right?\n\n262\n00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,330\nIf this is the first time you're\ndeploying FileVault though,\n\n263\n00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,600\nthen this is where you start.\n\n264\n00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,350\nYou just enable FileVault version 2.\n\n265\n00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,540\nAnd it's super easy to turn it on, right?\n\n266\n00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,180\nLet me show you what's involved.\n\n267\n00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,180\nWith FileVault, you have what's called\na master password, or a master key.\n\n268\n00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,140\nThis encryption key is what's used to\nencrypt your drive and decrypt the drive.\n\n269\n00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,050\nIt's a private key, right?\n\n270\n00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,700\nWell, in order to be able to read the\ndata, you've gotta have that private key\n\n271\n00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,850\nto be able to decrypt it, otherwise,\nyou can't access the data.\n\n272\n00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:52,030\nSo turning on FileVault is really simple\nas that, it's gonna create this password,\n\n273\n00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,480\nit's gonna encrypt the drive, and it's\ngonna allow you access to it, all right?\n\n274\n00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,880\nAt its simplest, all we do is go into\nSystem Preferences, go into Security and\n\n275\n00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,570\nPrivacy, go to FileVault and\nchoose to turn it on.\n\n276\n00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,500\nNow notice how it's locked.\n\n277\n00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,208\nI have to be an administrator\nto turn this on.\n\n278\n00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,150\nWith Legacy FileVault, you are only\nencrypting your home directory and\n\n279\n00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,790\nso any user can do it.\n\n280\n00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,960\nBut here we're encrypting the whole drive.\n\n281\n00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,410\nYou don't want a regular user,\na standard user to encrypt the drive and\n\n282\n00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,120\nprevent you an administrator\nfrom being able to get to it.\n\n283\n00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,920\nSo you've got to be an administrator.\n\n284\n00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,890\nNow, that does bring up\nan interesting questions.\n\n285\n00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,030\nWhich is, all right,\n\n286\n00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:37,000\nif I encrypt it as an administrator,\nhow do my regular users decrypt the drive?\n\n287\n00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,010\nAnd the answer is, by default, they don't.\n\n288\n00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,390\nThat they can't decrypt it.\n\n289\n00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,050\nThat every time the machine boots, you as\nan administrator would have to come and\n\n290\n00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,290\nunlock it, and\nthen they'd be able to use it and log in,\n\n291\n00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,340\nbecause they wouldn't have the key.\n\n292\n00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,450\nSo, the setup for\nFileVault is a little bit different.\n\n293\n00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,790\nIf you have multiple users\nversus a single user.\n\n294\n00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,280\nSo before I turn it on, I'm going go\nback to my System Preferences and\n\n295\n00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,870\ngo to Users and Groups, and\nI'm going to create an extra user account.\n\n296\n00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,610\nI'm going to create one more.\n\n297\n00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,760\nI know most people you probably have\na single user account on your computer, so\n\n298\n00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,000\nthis isn't a big deal.\n\n299\n00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,450\nBut just to show you guys all of\nthe different possible outcomes,\n\n300\n00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,340\nI want to have a second user here.\n\n301\n00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,510\nSo, I'm going to create another one.\n\n302\n00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,380\nMaybe I'll create one for our producer.\n\n303\n00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,930\nSo I'll get one in here for\nNathan Copeland.\n\n304\n00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,242\nAnd we'll just set him\nup as a standard user.\n\n305\n00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:28,482\nAll right,\nI don't want him to be an administrator,\n\n306\n00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:31,350\nLord only knows what he would\ndo on the computer, and so\n\n307\n00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,830\nnow I've got that extra user\naccount to worry about.\n\n308\n00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,920\nAnd it doesn't matter if you have two\naccounts or two hundred accounts,\n\n309\n00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,212\nthe rest of this process will be the same.\n\n310\n00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:41,780\nAll right now I'm going to go back\nto my assistant preferences and\n\n311\n00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,900\nI'll go to security and privacy and\n\n312\n00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,680\nI'll unlock that screen, and\nI'll hit turn on FireVault.\n\n313\n00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,640\nI keep saying fireball,\nlike we're gonna burn the thing.\n\n314\n00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,050\nAll right, so I'm gonna turn it on.\n\n315\n00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,450\nNow, when we go to turn it on,\n\n316\n00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,375\nI mentioned that there's gotta\nbe this private key, right?\n\n317\n00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,310\nThis key that can be used\nto decrypt the drive.\n\n318\n00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,540\nWell, the key gets to\nattached to our account.\n\n319\n00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,563\nAnd so for us,\nwe don't have to remember this key,\n\n320\n00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:08,410\nwe just log in with our user name and\npassword.\n\n321\n00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,460\nIt's attached to us, but\nwhat if something happens to our account.\n\n322\n00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,360\nWhat if I forget my password,\nif I can't log in?\n\n323\n00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,050\nNot only can I not log in,\n\n324\n00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,210\nI can't decrypt the hard drive cuz\nthe key was attached to my account.\n\n325\n00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,320\nSo what do I do?\n\n326\n00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,470\nWell they've got two options for us here.\n\n327\n00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,796\nOption number one, is you can set\nup iCloud, if you set up iCloud,\n\n328\n00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:32,343\nthe encryption feed for\n\n329\n00:16:32,343 --> 00:16:36,924\nyour account will be attached to\nyour iCloud account, your Apple ID.\n\n330\n00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:40,426\nAnd if you forget your password,\nyou can go and reset your Apple ID,\n\n331\n00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:44,851\nnow that that's reset, you'll have access\nto your encryption key again to be able to\n\n332\n00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:47,210\ndecrypt the hard drive, right?\n\n333\n00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,230\nYou might want that, but\n\n334\n00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,220\nif disc encryption is something\nthat's important to you.\n\n335\n00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,970\nStoring your private key, not in the\ncloud, is probably important to you also.\n\n336\n00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,940\nSo it's not necessarily\nthe greatest option, so\n\n337\n00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,790\nthe other option here is\nto create a recovery key.\n\n338\n00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,590\nAnd don't store it in the cloud.\n\n339\n00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,280\nIn other words, let us store it ourselves.\n\n340\n00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,270\nIf you're worried about security,\nthat's probably the best option.\n\n341\n00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,880\nAll right.\n\n342\n00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,560\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nmove forward with that step.\n\n343\n00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,420\nOn the very next screen, if I had chosen\niCloud, I would have to login with iCloud.\n\n344\n00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,020\nIt would attach it to my account.\n\n345\n00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,930\nSince I didn't, it's gonna display for\nme, the key Now,\n\n346\n00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,230\nthis is the only time it\nwill show me this key.\n\n347\n00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,320\nOnce I hit Continue the key is done.\n\n348\n00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,400\nI can't get it again.\n\n349\n00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,480\nIf I wanna get the key again I have to\nturn off FileVault to decrypt the drive,\n\n350\n00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,920\nand then turn FileVault\nback on to re-encrypt it.\n\n351\n00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,130\nAnd it'll generate a new key, all right?\n\n352\n00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,254\nSo it's important that you get a copy of\nthis key alright and that you store it\n\n353\n00:17:47,254 --> 00:17:52,398\nsomewhere securely now let's go super\nparanoid here for a moment, right?\n\n354\n00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:56,022\nIf I write this key down on a piece of\npaper and then I throw it in the trash,\n\n355\n00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:59,647\nsomebody can find it and now they've\ngot that key, and now they can go and\n\n356\n00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:03,361\ndecrypt my drive if they know that's\nwhat the key belongs to, all right?\n\n357\n00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:08,426\nIf I save it to a USB drive and forget\nabout it right that's a problem If we\n\n358\n00:18:08,426 --> 00:18:14,280\nwanna go super mega paranoid, if I copy\nthis key into my clipboard, right?\n\n359\n00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,100\nNow it's in memory.\n\n360\n00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,020\nThere could be other software running\non my computer that sees this key\n\n361\n00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,790\nin memory and says, oh,\n\n362\n00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,630\nthat looks like a file vault key,\nI'm gonna send that somewhere else, right?\n\n363\n00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:28,980\nSo the ideal situation\nis you look at that key,\n\n364\n00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,460\nyou document it on a piece of paper,\nand you stick it in a vault.\n\n365\n00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,690\nA real vault somewhere that people\ndon't have access to, right.\n\n366\n00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,400\nOr you write it in a text file and\nsave it, burn it to a CD.\n\n367\n00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,670\nAnd lock the CD up right.\n\n368\n00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,980\nBut you need to store it somewhere secure,\nsomewhere where you won't lose it.\n\n369\n00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,260\nBecause you may need it one day.\n\n370\n00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,440\nIf you get locked out of your own account,\n\n371\n00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,230\nyou'll need this key to be able\nto decrypt the drive right.\n\n372\n00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:57,650\nNow I'm going to go ahead and copy it and\nlet me just stick it into a note here.\n\n373\n00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,210\nHere we go.\nSo this is my Recovery Key.\n\n374\n00:19:02,152 --> 00:19:04,240\nAll right, so I've got my Recovery Key in.\n\n375\n00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,620\nAnd you guys,\nif you're watching this show,\n\n376\n00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,900\nyou could write this key down as say, ooh,\nif I'm ever in Gainesville, I could go and\n\n377\n00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,520\ngrab Don's laptop and use that key.\n\n378\n00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,600\nWell, I'm actually encrypting a virtual\nmachine here so it doesn't truly matter.\n\n379\n00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,330\nBut if you had that key, you in theory\nwould be able to decrypt that drive and\n\n380\n00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,180\naccess the data that was on it.\n\n381\n00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,340\nThat's all it takes is having that key.\n\n382\n00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:22,710\nAll right.\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n383\n00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,310\nhit Continue on that.\n\n384\n00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,590\nAnd here's the screen that's different\nif you have more than one user account.\n\n385\n00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,690\nIf I only had one user account.\n\n386\n00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,699\nThis screen wouldn't appear and\nI'd continue one, but\n\n387\n00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:37,897\nthis screen comes up cuz I have more than\none, and it's basically saying look,\n\n388\n00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:40,921\nby default only you will be\nable to unlock the hard drive.\n\n389\n00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:45,660\nSo whenever the computer boots up,\nyou have to be the first person to log in.\n\n390\n00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,660\nNo other user will be able to log in until\nyou have unlocked the drive, all right.\n\n391\n00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,330\nSo I can enable other people if I want.\n\n392\n00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,340\nAnd what's it's doing, is it's taking that\nprivate key, that encryption key, and\n\n393\n00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,840\nit's attaching it to\nthe other accounts also.\n\n394\n00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,280\nIt's authorizing them to be able\nto work with the drive, all right?\n\n395\n00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,060\nAnd so I can see Nate listed right here,\nand if I want to enable him, I can.\n\n396\n00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,300\nHere's the problem.\n\n397\n00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,260\nThe key, it is itself encrypted\nbased on our user account password.\n\n398\n00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,480\nSo it's kind of double encrypted.\n\n399\n00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,720\nSo when I go to enable that,\nit's gonna ask me for Nate's password,\n\n400\n00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,630\nbecause it needs to be encrypted\nin a way that he has access to it.\n\n401\n00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,350\nI don't want to encrypt it with my\npassword because Nate doesn't have that So\n\n402\n00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,830\nit's getting equipped with his.\n\n403\n00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,480\nSo here's where I need to go to him and\nsay, hey, Nate,\n\n404\n00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,220\nI need you to come over here and punch in\nyour password, I don't know it, right?\n\n405\n00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,960\nOr I could reset his password and\n\n406\n00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,440\nset it there, but in this case I\ncreated the account so I know it.\n\n407\n00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,710\nSo I'll go ahead and punch it in,\nand now he's authorized too.\n\n408\n00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,100\nSo when the computer boots up, not only\ncan I unlock it but he can unlock it too.\n\n409\n00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,900\nSo it's not dependent on me anymore.\n\n410\n00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,530\nThat's something we have to worry\nabout if you have more than one user.\n\n411\n00:20:55,732 --> 00:21:00,880\nAll right now hit Continue, and it's just\ngoing to tell me it's got to restart.\n\n412\n00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,490\nIf file encryption happens beneath the\noperating system this is very low level.\n\n413\n00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,270\nAnd so it can't just turn it on\nwhile the system is running.\n\n414\n00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,580\nIt has to reboot.\n\n415\n00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,110\nNow, interesting thing\nis gonna happen here.\n\n416\n00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,160\nMy drive has already been in use,\nI've already been putting data on it,\n\n417\n00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,190\nI've already installed applications and\nso on, right?\n\n418\n00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,960\nThis is a computer that's in use.\n\n419\n00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,370\nIt's gonna reboot and\nstart reencrypting, or\n\n420\n00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,530\nencrypting in the first place,\nall the files on my drive.\n\n421\n00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,940\nNot just my home directory, but\nthe operating system files,\n\n422\n00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,280\nthe applications and so on.\n\n423\n00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,000\nFor the best possible security,\n\n424\n00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,300\nwe were talking about this in\nthe chat room over the break.\n\n425\n00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,540\nJames had mentioned in\nthere it's always better\n\n426\n00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,060\nto turn encryption on as soon as possible.\n\n427\n00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,730\nSo you install Yosemite and\n\n428\n00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,490\nimmediately turn on File Vault\nbefore you start using the system.\n\n429\n00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,200\nAll right.\n\n430\n00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,930\nIf you've already been using the system,\nif you've already got a lot of data on\n\n431\n00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,290\nthere and you turn on encryption now,\nit's effective, it works.\n\n432\n00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,530\nBut if somebody already had an idea\nof the data that was on your disk,\n\n433\n00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:01,010\nthey can use that as part\nof an attack to try and\n\n434\n00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,150\nbasically figure out\nwhat your private key is.\n\n435\n00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,350\nIt can be a little bit dangerous.\n\n436\n00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,320\nIt's still a very, very complex attack so\nit's not something most people have to\n\n437\n00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,580\nworry about, but\nit does weaken security a small degree.\n\n438\n00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,920\nSo it's better to turn this on very,\nvery soon.\n\n439\n00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,710\nMy system doesn't have\na ton of usage on it.\n\n440\n00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,880\nIn fact, that Nathan account has\nnever even logged in, right.\n\n441\n00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,300\nSo his data will be completely protected,\n\n442\n00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,870\ncreated while the drive\nwas already encrypted.\n\n443\n00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,270\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit Restart though, and it's gonna reboot.\n\n444\n00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:31,560\nNow fortunately, it's not gonna\ntie up my system for too long.\n\n445\n00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,510\nSome systems, when they go to encrypt,\nyou have to wait for them to finish, and\n\n446\n00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,760\nthe more data you have\nthe longer it can take.\n\n447\n00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,310\nIf you've got 20 Megs of data it can\nencrypt very fast, but if you have five\n\n448\n00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:49,170\nterabytes of data, it could take hours\nupon hours to encrypt the entire drive.\n\n449\n00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,060\nWell what's gonna happen is the system\nis gonna reboot, and because this is\n\n450\n00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,910\nhooked into the hard drive drivers\ninside of Mac OS, it's gonna run beneath\n\n451\n00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,620\nthe operating system, beneath the UI, and\nstart encrypting data in the background.\n\n452\n00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,560\nAnd that means that I'm gonna be\nable to keep using the system.\n\n453\n00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,590\nEven though it is still encrypting.\n\n454\n00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,160\nI'm going to log in here as myself.\n\n455\n00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,020\nSo here I am getting logged in.\n\n456\n00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,250\nAnd the log in might take a little\nbit longer than normal because it's\n\n457\n00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,240\nkicking off file vault.\n\n458\n00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,540\nAnd if I remember right we'll actually\nsee a little message about file vault.\n\n459\n00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,370\nBut then it's gonna boot to the UI, and\n\n460\n00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:31,600\nonce we're in the UI, right here, it's\ngonna start encrypting in the background.\n\n461\n00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,060\nAnd I'm free to use the system.\n\n462\n00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,810\nI can fire up my web browser.\n\n463\n00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,720\nI can, you know, start editing documents,\nand so on, and so on.\n\n464\n00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,980\nThe system will be a little\nslower because it's encrypting.\n\n465\n00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,750\nAnd you've got to wait for this to run.\n\n466\n00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,220\nNow I've got a pretty based install here,\nso\n\n467\n00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,350\nI don't have a ton a data and it's going\nto take about eight minutes to encrypt.\n\n468\n00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,638\nIf you had a terabyte of data\ncan take considerably longer.\n\n469\n00:23:52,638 --> 00:23:55,402\nI think I've got, well here,\nlet's see how much data I have.\n\n470\n00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:56,333\nWell, we'll find out.\n\n471\n00:23:56,333 --> 00:24:00,888\nSo if I take my hard drive here.\n\n472\n00:24:00,888 --> 00:24:05,680\nOh, wait, that's not my hard\ndrive that's my actual laptop.\n\n473\n00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,394\nMy hard drive is not showing up, because\nfinder preferences are telling it not to.\n\n474\n00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:13,710\nThere we go.\n\n475\n00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,870\nAll right, let's see how much data\nI actually have on this drive.\n\n476\n00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:21,890\nSo I have looks like about 10 gigs,\n\n477\n00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,642\nmaybe 11 gigs of data on this drive,\n10.25 gigs is what it's saying.\n\n478\n00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:29,680\nSo 10.25 gigs is gonna take\nabout 8 minutes on my system.\n\n479\n00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,550\nWell if you had a terabyte,\nthat's significantly more data.\n\n480\n00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,010\nAnd you see if this took 8 minutes,\n\n481\n00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,280\nthen that might take 800 minutes which\namounts to a good chunk of the day, right?\n\n482\n00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,590\nThat's over half a day.\n\n483\n00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,900\nSo be prepared for that,\nit can take a while.\n\n484\n00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,190\nBut it's nice that you\ncan still use the system.\n\n485\n00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:51,670\nJust be aware you are not safe,\nyou are not secure until this is done.\n\n486\n00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,140\nIf somebody were to steal my system right\nnow, the whole drive is non encrypted,\n\n487\n00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,720\nparts of it are, but not the whole drive.\n\n488\n00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,970\nSo I've got to wait until that's\ncompletely done before I'm truly safe and\n\n489\n00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,400\nsecure, so if this is a brand new system.\n\n490\n00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,407\nI get my brand new system in, I log in for\nthe first time I turn on file vault and\n\n491\n00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:12,600\nI stop, and I just let it run, and I don't\ntake it with me in a cab or on a plane, or\n\n492\n00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,265\nwherever I might lose it,\nbecause I want to wait until it's secure.\n\n493\n00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,063\nAnd once it's secure then,\nI start throwing my user data on there,\n\n494\n00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:20,990\ngetting all of my other\ninformation in place.\n\n495\n00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,710\nBecause I know it's secure,\nand now I can take it with me.\n\n496\n00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,280\nAnd if I lose the device I'll be fine.\n\n497\n00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,680\nWell, I won't be fine.\n\n498\n00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,730\nThen I'll have lost my device.\n\n499\n00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,410\nBut, I'll be fine knowing\nthat my data is secure.\n\n500\n00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,130\nThat's what FileVault is all about.\n\n501\n00:25:34,512 --> 00:25:35,990\nAll right,\nthis should finish up here about soon.\n\n502\n00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,610\nThat didn't actually take eight minutes,\ndid it?\n\n503\n00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,350\nThat went pretty quick.\n\n504\n00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,410\nBut we'll give it a moment\nwhile it churns through there.\n\n505\n00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,030\nThe biggest improvement that we\nget with FileVault version two\n\n506\n00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,150\nis the fact that the entire\ndisc is encrypted.\n\n507\n00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,230\nSo if somebody tries to boot and\nboot to recovery, or\n\n508\n00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,954\nif they try to boot to target mode,\nthat disc is secured.\n\n509\n00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,030\nIt It's safe.\n\n510\n00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,230\nWith the legacy File Vault,\nsince it was only your home directory,\n\n511\n00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,150\nthere were certain files they\ncould still get access to.\n\n512\n00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,830\nAnd that was part of its weakness.\n\n513\n00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,480\nRecovery could bypass it.\n\n514\n00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,420\nYou wouldn't be able to\nget the home directories.\n\n515\n00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,160\nBut you'd be able to\nget to everything else.\n\n516\n00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,870\nSo that's the advantage that we get here.\n\n517\n00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,740\nAnd you'll find that most operating\nsystem vendors are doing this.\n\n518\n00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,375\nJames mentioned in the chatroom\nthere about BitLocker.\n\n519\n00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:17,790\nBitLocker does the same thing.\n\n520\n00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,350\nThat's the Microsoft version of that.\n\n521\n00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,820\nAll right, now, James asked a question\nin the chatroom about the free space.\n\n522\n00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,890\nWhat about the free space on the drive?\n\n523\n00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,080\nWhen it's encrypting our data.\n\n524\n00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,320\nIt's just encrypting the data that exists,\nright?\n\n525\n00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,630\nThe real data on the system.\n\n526\n00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,260\nWe still have free space\nthat's available that is\n\n527\n00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,500\ndata that's not going to get\nencrypted right now, all right?\n\n528\n00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,130\nBut there might have\nbeen information there.\n\n529\n00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,750\nLet me clarify, like If I had a file\non the hard drive, let's say that\n\n530\n00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:52,600\nI had a 4 gig DVD image sitting\nthere on my drive and I deleted it.\n\n531\n00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,740\nIt's gone, I deleted it.\n\n532\n00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,450\nIf you have a magnetic drive, there is\nstill a residual magnetic signature there\n\n533\n00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:04,010\nfor that file, and a forensics expert\ncan come in and recover that data.\n\n534\n00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,230\nWhen we turn on FileVault it's\nencrypting the drive, but\n\n535\n00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,970\nit's only encrypting the active data,\nnot the deleted data.\n\n536\n00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,660\nSo you might have deleted\ndata in that free space area\n\n537\n00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,740\nthat's not getting encrypted and\nforensic software could recover it.\n\n538\n00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,990\nNow if you overwrite it,\n\n539\n00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:21,790\nyour new data is encrypted in your save,\nbut the free data isn't.\n\n540\n00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:26,240\nAnd so we need to talk about,\nwhat do we do about the free space?\n\n541\n00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,360\nIt's an excellent segway,\n\n542\n00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,550\nI love your question James because\nit's the exact next thing here in my\n\n543\n00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:36,140\nshow notes is talking about securing\nthat empty space on the drive.\n\n544\n00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,300\nTurning on FileVault\nlike this is step one.\n\n545\n00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,510\nStep two is making sure\nwe purge the empty data.\n\n546\n00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,260\nIf this is a brand new laptop,\nthe empty data is, literally, empty.\n\n547\n00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,120\nWe don't have to worry about it.\n\n548\n00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,665\nIt goes back to the statement of\nthe sooner you turn on the FileVault\n\n549\n00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:50,960\nthe better off you are.\n\n550\n00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,690\nBut if it's a laptop or\na device that's been in use for\n\n551\n00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,460\na while,\nwe'll need to purge that empty space.\n\n552\n00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,900\nAnd that's what we're\ngonna take a look at next.\n\n553\n00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,720\nBut, let's just wrap up FileVault here\nfirst, maybe we'll take a break and\n\n554\n00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,270\ndo the free space after that,\nbut looking here I can see that\n\n555\n00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:11,690\nmy encryption is finished,\nthe drive is in place and I'm in business.\n\n556\n00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,640\nI am encrypted, my data is secure and\nwe're ready to rock.\n\n557\n00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,350\nNow during the install,\nwe created a recovery key and\n\n558\n00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:23,260\nit gave us that recovery key,\nI've got it sitting aside and\n\n559\n00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,260\nI can use that in the event that\nI ever forget my password, okay?\n\n560\n00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,120\nWell, if I try and\nlog in to this system, and\n\n561\n00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,280\nI don't know my password, what happens?\n\n562\n00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,440\nWell, if it's tied to my iTunes or\nnot iTunes, but your Apple ID,\n\n563\n00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,250\nif it's tied to your Apple ID,\nyou can recover it that way.\n\n564\n00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,780\nBut if you don't have the Apple ID,\nyou can recover using your recovery key.\n\n565\n00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,750\nAnd the way it works is\nbasically like this.\n\n566\n00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,910\nIt's a little bit weird.\n\n567\n00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:46,880\nLet me show you.\n\n568\n00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,030\nI'm gonna restart this computer.\n\n569\n00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,220\nWe'll reboot.\n\n570\n00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,230\nAnd when it reboots it's gonna come up and\nwe'll see the log in screen.\n\n571\n00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,900\nNow normally, I would log in here and\n\n572\n00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,140\nproviding my password would inform\nthe system that it's me, and\n\n573\n00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,810\nit would allow me to decode the key that's\nattached to my account which would allow\n\n574\n00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,850\nme to unlock the drive,\nand then I get logged in.\n\n575\n00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,650\nThat's the normal process for a login.\n\n576\n00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,910\nBut if I can't remember my password and\nI try to log in, and I get it wrong,\n\n577\n00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,213\nwhat do I do?\n\n578\n00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:21,190\nAll right, well you get this little\nquestion mark right here, and\n\n579\n00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,430\nif we hit that question mark,\nsee how it says,\n\n580\n00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:28,290\nif you forgot your password you can\ndot dot dot, all right, why the dots?\n\n581\n00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,840\nWell because the second part of that\nsentence is going to be different\n\n582\n00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,090\ndepending on your account.\n\n583\n00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,900\nReset it using your Apple ID.\n\n584\n00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,670\nGo to, I think it's appleid.apple.com,\nor something like that.\n\n585\n00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,490\nYou go to their website and\nyou can reset it.\n\n586\n00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,040\nBut mine says,\nreset it using your recovery key.\n\n587\n00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,910\nI had to hit the question\nmark to get that, and\n\n588\n00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,540\nthat's the step that\na lot of people forget.\n\n589\n00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,190\nThey're like, why doesn't it\never prompt that recovery key?\n\n590\n00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,550\nYou gotta hit the question mark.\n\n591\n00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,120\nYou will see the message there, and you\ncan choose reset it using your recovery\n\n592\n00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,060\nkey, and now it's prompting\nme from my recovery key.\n\n593\n00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,530\nAnd I can go in and type in\nwhatever that key is, and you know,\n\n594\n00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,680\nI don't know if it's going\nto let me copy and paste.\n\n595\n00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,760\nIt's because this is\nlike a firmware screen.\n\n596\n00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,630\nIt probably won't.\n\n597\n00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,880\nLet me see if parallels will let me do it.\n\n598\n00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,940\nThis is a virtual machine\non top of parallels, so\n\n599\n00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,110\nit might let me break the rules here.\n\n600\n00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,540\nAnd I'll see if that will work.\n\n601\n00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:25,920\nOh no, it's gonna make me type it.\n\n602\n00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:31,470\nBut basically, you would type in that long\nkey, and I guess I could bore us to death.\n\n603\n00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,820\nOr let's do this, let's pause and\n\n604\n00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,890\ntake a break, that way I can write\nthat key down and type it in here.\n\n605\n00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,520\nI don't want us to watch me go back and\nforth on the screen.\n\n606\n00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,940\nSo I'll get that typed in, and\nwhen we come back from the break,\n\n607\n00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,100\nwe'll pick back up with me punching\nin that key, and getting in there and\n\n608\n00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,900\nrecovering the system.\n\n609\n00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,840\nThis would be that emergency step you'd\ntake if you forgot your password.\n\n610\n00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,450\nAnd then right after that, we'll take\na look at the free space that's on\n\n611\n00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,580\nthe drive so\nwe can show how to wipe that out too.\n\n612\n00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,350\nSo let's pause here.\n\n613\n00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,712\nWhen we get back, drive recovery and\nfree space after this.\n\n614\n00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:07,666\n[MUSIC]\n\n615\n00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,390\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n616\n00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,900\nSo, during the break,\nI typed in my recovery keys so\n\n617\n00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,020\nyou didn't have to watch me do that.\n\n618\n00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,300\nBut basically,\nI got it punched in right there.\n\n619\n00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,120\nThere we go, not terribly exciting there.\n\n620\n00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,255\nAnd when I go forward on it,\nit's recovering.\n\n621\n00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,210\nOkay, so I can see the little status\nbar going there across the bottom.\n\n622\n00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,950\nIt's applying that recovery\nkey to the system.\n\n623\n00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,090\nThis is part of the file vault recovery.\n\n624\n00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,250\nYou only want to do this if you\nhave forgotten your password.\n\n625\n00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,360\nIf you can't get logged in because the\nprivate key is attached to your account.\n\n626\n00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,040\nIf you can log in with your account.\n\n627\n00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,550\nYou'll be in business, all right.\n\n628\n00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,610\nBut here I had to use that recovery key.\n\n629\n00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,540\nSo this is that backup.\n\n630\n00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:49,870\nSo if I don't know my password and I don't\nhave the recovery key, I'm out of luck.\n\n631\n00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,770\nI can't recover my data even if you take\nyour laptop down to the Apple store,\n\n632\n00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,860\nthey can't recover it either, right?\n\n633\n00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:01,900\nYou've got to have one of those two things\neither your password or the recovery key.\n\n634\n00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,667\nYou don't have to have both of them,\nright.\n\n635\n00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:05,770\nIf you have your password,\nthat's all you need.\n\n636\n00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,950\nIf you have the recovery key, you can\nrecover from forgetting your password.\n\n637\n00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,410\nIf you don't have either of them,\nyou're just out of luck.\n\n638\n00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,660\nThere is no legitimate way\nto be able to get in there.\n\n639\n00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,980\nIf you can find a way to break\nthe AES128 encryption that's on there,\n\n640\n00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,800\nthen you can certainly go that route,\nbut otherwise that's it.\n\n641\n00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,700\nNow notice when I recover it's\nmaking me reset my password.\n\n642\n00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,620\nThat's fine,\ncuz we don't know our password anyway.\n\n643\n00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,300\nI don't know my password.\n\n644\n00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,040\nSo I've got to go in here and punch in\nwhat I want that new password to be.\n\n645\n00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,880\nAnd I'll go and flag that in.\n\n646\n00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,400\nI think I typed the same thing twice.\n\n647\n00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,510\nI guess we'll find out here in a moment.\n\n648\n00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:42,330\nAnd it's gonna reset my password, and\nnow I'll be able to get into the system.\n\n649\n00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,000\nNow, that shows you the danger\nright there of the recovery key.\n\n650\n00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,810\nIf somebody had my recovery key,\n\n651\n00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:52,200\nall they have to do is sit down at the\ncomputer click on my user account don't\n\n652\n00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,170\neven have to try a password they can just\nhit that question mark, right off the bat.\n\n653\n00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:57,501\nPunch it in, reset my password and\n\n654\n00:32:57,501 --> 00:33:00,730\nnow they have full access to the system,\nas me.\n\n655\n00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,270\nRight.\n\n656\n00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,250\nMake sure you secure that recovery key.\n\n657\n00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,080\nDon't do things like, write it on a piece\nof paper like I did, during the break and\n\n658\n00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,070\nleave it laying around.\n\n659\n00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,240\nPeople can get that.\n\n660\n00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,130\nRight.\n\n661\n00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,310\nDon't show it on internet-streamed\ntelevision, like I'm doing right now.\n\n662\n00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,545\nThose are all bad things.\n\n663\n00:33:15,545 --> 00:33:17,330\n[LAUGH] You wanna make sure\nyou keep it secure and\n\n664\n00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,470\nthat only you have access to it.\n\n665\n00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:19,990\nAll right?\n\n666\n00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,272\nSo that's recovery using the Recovery key.\n\n667\n00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,440\nAll right.\nThe process is almost identical for\n\n668\n00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,950\nthe Apple ID, except instead of\ntyping in that recovery key,\n\n669\n00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,380\nyou type in your Apple ID information.\n\n670\n00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,410\nYou login to Apple ID or you go and reset\nyour password through your Apple ID and\n\n671\n00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,130\nthen you gain access.\n\n672\n00:33:38,152 --> 00:33:40,940\nAll right, the other thing we were\ntalking about before the break,\n\n673\n00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,160\nJames had mentioned in the chat room,\nwhat about the free space on the drive?\n\n674\n00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,100\nWell, we have a big problem\nwith deleted files on a Mac.\n\n675\n00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,670\nNot on a Mac,\non any system that uses magnetic media.\n\n676\n00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,140\nAnd actually that's worth\nmentioning here too.\n\n677\n00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,040\nOn a modern MAC,\nyou've got two different types of storage.\n\n678\n00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,770\nThere's traditional magnetic hard drives,\nand\n\n679\n00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,730\nthen there's the new solid state digital,\nthe SSDs.\n\n680\n00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:10,410\nThe magnetic hard drives have a spinning\nmetal platter inside of them,\n\n681\n00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:14,050\nand a little arm that puts\nmagnetic charges on the disk to\n\n682\n00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,530\nkeep track of whether you have a one or\nzero, right?\n\n683\n00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,820\nYour bits and bytes and\nall that good stuff on the drive.\n\n684\n00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,980\nThe SSDs, on the other hand,\nhave thousands upon thousands of\n\n685\n00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,540\ntransistors that are all writing\nlittle values to store a one or\n\n686\n00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,020\na zero bit and holding those values.\n\n687\n00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,915\nAnd when you clear one, the transistor\njust opens up and the data goes away and\n\n688\n00:34:34,915 --> 00:34:35,945\nthat's it and\n\n689\n00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:42,205\nSSD doesn't maintain that residual charge\nthe same way that a magnetic drive does.\n\n690\n00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:45,475\nAnd as a result when things get\ndeleted off of SSD it's not\n\n691\n00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:47,915\nsomething we typically have\nto worry to much about.\n\n692\n00:34:47,915 --> 00:34:50,595\nThere are some recovery methods I was\ntrying to get a hold of one of our\n\n693\n00:34:50,595 --> 00:34:54,230\nsecurity hosts here to find out\na little bit more about the SSD side.\n\n694\n00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,360\nBut on the magnetic side,\nis where we have the real risk.\n\n695\n00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,680\nOn magnetic media that magnetic impulse or\ncharge or\n\n696\n00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,410\nwhatever you place on the drive it can\nlinger even after you delete the file,\n\n697\n00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,580\neven after you've overwritten the file.\n\n698\n00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,130\nIf it had a one before and\nyou written a zero to it now.\n\n699\n00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,970\nThere's a little bit of that magnetic\ncharge that stays behind that let's you\n\n700\n00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,980\nknow this used to be a one.\n\n701\n00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,510\nIt's a zero now, but it used to be a one.\n\n702\n00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,570\nI can tell cuz it's not quite zero, right?\n\n703\n00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:26,040\nSo we can start to reconstruct\ndata that's been deleted.\n\n704\n00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,380\nNow who would wanna do that?\n\n705\n00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,760\nWell normally it's law enforcement, right?\n\n706\n00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,000\nLaw enforcement,\nwhen they seize laptops and\n\n707\n00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,830\ndesktops in a raid they'll normally look\nto find out what data was stored on them.\n\n708\n00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,420\nAnd there's the active data\nthat's in place on it.\n\n709\n00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,680\nThat's usually good but the deleted stuff\nis normally the juicy stuff, right.\n\n710\n00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,790\nThat's what they want.\n\n711\n00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:46,250\nAnd so they can run forensic software\nthat will scan the hard drives and\n\n712\n00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,000\nit will recover the data\nthat's been deleted.\n\n713\n00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,710\nYou also get this from hackers, people\nare trying to break into systems and\n\n714\n00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,750\nget information out of it, you might\nthink that you deleted the sensitive data\n\n715\n00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,500\nthat's not there anymore,\nthen you sell your laptop on eBay, right?\n\n716\n00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,390\nOr you give it to a friend say I'm done\nwith this laptop you can have it, and\n\n717\n00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:08,200\nthey run forensics software and\nthey lift off all of this deleted data,\n\n718\n00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,480\nstuff that you thought was cleared out,\nbut it's there right.\n\n719\n00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,860\nThose are two problems, the third one\nthough is the one James is talking about;\n\n720\n00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:20,190\nwhich is, when you encrypt the hard drive,\nit only encrypts the actual data right.\n\n721\n00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,780\nWhat about the free space on the drive?\n\n722\n00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,750\nWell that free space doesn't get\nencrypted, because there is nothing there.\n\n723\n00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,930\nNothing there.\n\n724\n00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,780\nThere used to be something there, and the\nmagnetic signatures are more than likely\n\n725\n00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,160\nstill strong enough that\nthat data can be recovered.\n\n726\n00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,330\nAnd it's not encrypted,\neven though you just turned on FileVault.\n\n727\n00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:41,300\nSo, if this was a blank\nhard drive to start with,\n\n728\n00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,680\nyou turn on FileVault, and that's it but\nif there was existing data,\n\n729\n00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,540\nif you've been using the system,\nit's a good idea to scrub your free space.\n\n730\n00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,270\nLet me show you how we can do that.\n\n731\n00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:55,220\nThere's actually a few different ways\nthat we can scrub our free space\n\n732\n00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,090\ninside of Mac OS, all right?\n\n733\n00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,430\nThe first way is we can\nuse the disk utility.\n\n734\n00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,490\nWhen I attach a drive, in fact, I'm not\ngonna use the virtual machine on this one.\n\n735\n00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,730\nLet me just flip over to\nmy actual machine here.\n\n736\n00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,490\nHere we go, so here's my machine.\n\n737\n00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:14,730\nAnd if I want to scrub the free space on\nsomething, I'll use my USB drive here.\n\n738\n00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,188\nSo I've got a USB drive,\nit's 250 gigs in size.\n\n739\n00:37:18,188 --> 00:37:22,100\nI think it's 230 gigs formatted or\nsomething crazy like that.\n\n740\n00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,440\nAnd inside of it I've just got some of\nmy install media that I've been using.\n\n741\n00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,570\nSo those guys are sitting right there.\n\n742\n00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,170\nWell, what about all\nthe extra space on this?\n\n743\n00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,313\nThe extra space may\nactually have data in it.\n\n744\n00:37:33,313 --> 00:37:37,270\nSo I might want to scrub that data\nto make sure that it's clear.\n\n745\n00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,879\nAnd with magnetic media\nthe only good way to do that,\n\n746\n00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:44,350\nis to overwrite the data\nthat was there before.\n\n747\n00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,010\nSo if there was a one there,\nwrite a zero to it.\n\n748\n00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,790\nWell if you write a zero to it that\nmight be enough to clear it out,\n\n749\n00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,740\nbut there might still be enough\nsignature to be able to recover it.\n\n750\n00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,400\nSo we might want to\noverwrite it more than once.\n\n751\n00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,450\nSo I write another zero to it and\nanother zero to it.\n\n752\n00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,692\nNow I just did it three times or\nI go even more and I do it seven times.\n\n753\n00:38:02,692 --> 00:38:05,146\nI just keep overwriting over and\nover again.\n\n754\n00:38:05,146 --> 00:38:09,088\nAnd if you keep overwriting that same bit,\nover and over again,\n\n755\n00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:13,176\neventually the residual magnetic\nsignature of that one is gone and\n\n756\n00:38:13,176 --> 00:38:15,400\nnow the data is non-recoverable.\n\n757\n00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,920\nIt's called scrubbing the free space.\n\n758\n00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,390\nAnd there are countless third-party\nutilities that are out there\n\n759\n00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,120\nI use one called dban pretty frequently,\n\n760\n00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,050\nwhere you can do really thorough\nscrubs of a drive to erase it.\n\n761\n00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,140\nIf you're gonna sell a device on eBay or\ngive it to a friend or\n\n762\n00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,070\nwhatever, it's a good idea\nto scrub the entire disk,\n\n763\n00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:36,220\nnot just the free space, before you sell\nit, to make sure that your data is safe.\n\n764\n00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,560\nWell, this is not a foolproof science.\n\n765\n00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,560\nSome data can still make it through,\nalthough it's unlikely.\n\n766\n00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,640\nSo you'll find governments,\n\n767\n00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,750\nmedical, financial institutes,\nwhere they don't even trust the scrubs.\n\n768\n00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,780\nWhat they do is they destroy the drives.\n\n769\n00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,060\nSo if they get rid of a computer\nthey take the hard drives out and\n\n770\n00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,570\nhave them shredded or melted down.\n\n771\n00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,920\nThat's the only way to be sure, right?\n\n772\n00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,656\nBut a scrub is usually good enough for,\nyour typical user, your home user,\n\n773\n00:39:03,656 --> 00:39:08,688\nto be able to clean the machine, and be\nreasonably safe that the machine is safe.\n\n774\n00:39:08,688 --> 00:39:09,605\nAll right.\n\n775\n00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:13,031\nSo, what we're going to do, is we're going\nto take a look at the tools that are built\n\n776\n00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:15,330\nright here in a Mac OS\nto be able to do that.\n\n777\n00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,540\nSo if I want to scrub the free\nspace on this USB drive\n\n778\n00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,500\nI can go into my disc utility.\n\n779\n00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,410\nSo I am just going to fire up the disc\nutility and I can find that USB drive so\n\n780\n00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,570\nhere it is, here is my 250 GB USB drive.\n\n781\n00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,650\nNow when you chose a drive or\n\n782\n00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:35,570\nif you choose a volume, you'll see we've\ngot this erase tab over here, all right.\n\n783\n00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:39,050\nAnd there is various options for\neach of these.\n\n784\n00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:43,938\nSo if I choose a hard drive,\nI've got the security options under erase.\n\n785\n00:39:43,938 --> 00:39:48,503\nIf I hit erase, all it does is flag\neverything on the drive as deleted but\n\n786\n00:39:48,503 --> 00:39:51,105\nthe data is sort of still there, right?\n\n787\n00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:54,002\nThe magnetic signatures\nare still there but\n\n788\n00:39:54,002 --> 00:39:59,890\nI can go down here to security options,\nand here I can define secure, erase.\n\n789\n00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,539\nAnd with secure erase,\n\n790\n00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:06,160\nit's going to overwrite the entire\ndrive with zeros, all right.\n\n791\n00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,520\nTo try and ensure that the data gets\noverwritten and can't be recoverable.\n\n792\n00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,740\nThe default is gonna operate the fastest.\n\n793\n00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,390\nWhich means it won't do overrides, it just\nflags everything as deleted and that's it.\n\n794\n00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,670\nThat kind of data is\nextremely easy to recover.\n\n795\n00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,030\nAll right.\nYou can use software like DiskWarrior,\n\n796\n00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,180\nwill scan right over that disk and\nrecover everything.\n\n797\n00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,530\nRecover deleted partitions, recover\ndeleted files, and bring it all back.\n\n798\n00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,928\nI've used DiskWarrior a number of times.\n\n799\n00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:29,220\nIt's a good product.\n\n800\n00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:33,391\nBut if we move that slider over,\nthe next step up says,\n\n801\n00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:38,160\nwe'll do a single pass of\nzeroes over the entire disk.\n\n802\n00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,400\nIt'll write a zero to every single\nsector across that entire disk.\n\n803\n00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,990\nRight?\nThat's a start.\n\n804\n00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,920\nIt's one pass.\n\n805\n00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,230\nIt does it one time.\n\n806\n00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:50,380\nAnd that'll stop some files\nfrom being recovered, but\n\n807\n00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,710\nother files might still make it.\n\n808\n00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,053\nSo we can go one more step,\nwhich is three passes.\n\n809\n00:40:57,053 --> 00:41:01,065\nNow it's gonna write a zero to a sector,\nwrite a zero to that same sector,\n\n810\n00:41:01,065 --> 00:41:04,882\nwrite a third zero to that same sector,\nand then go to the next one and so\n\n811\n00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:08,057\nit's gonna overwrite those\nsectors over and over again,\n\n812\n00:41:08,057 --> 00:41:11,540\nthree times to ensure that\ndata can't be recovered.\n\n813\n00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:16,210\nNow notice that is a DOE compliant\nthree pass security erase.\n\n814\n00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,950\nSo that is one that's been,\nbeen approved by the DOE and\n\n815\n00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,300\nit, it means their kind of requirements.\n\n816\n00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:22,930\nRight?\n\n817\n00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,178\nSo you can see where you\ncan go even further.\n\n818\n00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,636\nRight here to DoD.\n\n819\n00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:31,610\nIn the United States,\nDoD is the Department of Defense.\n\n820\n00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:34,400\nAnd Department of Defense,\nthat's our military, right?\n\n821\n00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,450\nThese are the people who hold sensitive\ndata for our government and our country.\n\n822\n00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,700\nAnd for them,\na seven pass wipe is good enough to meet\n\n823\n00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:47,120\nDoD 5220-22m standard to clear the data,\nright?\n\n824\n00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,820\nSo if you do it this way now it\nwrites seven times to every sector.\n\n825\n00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,730\nNow the stronger you make this,\nthe safer your data is.\n\n826\n00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:01,190\nBut the longer it takes,\nthis could take a long time.\n\n827\n00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,910\nThe other thing is,\n\n828\n00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:06,260\nthis is security erase, this is going\nto erase the entire hard drive.\n\n829\n00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,150\nI'm gonna lose everything and\nthat's not necessarily what I want.\n\n830\n00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,290\nRight?\nRemember the original question was about\n\n831\n00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,970\nfree space, right.\n\n832\n00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,010\nWell when I choose the hard drive,\nI don't get that choice,\n\n833\n00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,010\nI just erased the whole thing and\nthat's it.\n\n834\n00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:24,730\nBut if I choose a volume, and the volume\nis supported by Apple, in other words,\n\n835\n00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:28,750\nthat it's a Mac OS extended\njournal partition.\n\n836\n00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:33,470\nIf the volume is supported by Mac OS,\nI can choose it and\n\n837\n00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,910\nI get a new button right here\nwhich is erase free space.\n\n838\n00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:39,180\nThe button was there before,\nit's just grayed out right.\n\n839\n00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:45,070\nBut when I choose the volume it lights up\nand now I'm not erasing the whole drive,\n\n840\n00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,900\nI'm just erasing the empty space.\n\n841\n00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,010\nAnd I can choose to do fastest or\nI can do a three pass or\n\n842\n00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,900\nI can do a seven pass, all right.\n\n843\n00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,030\nThe fastest, this one.\n\n844\n00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:00,080\nNotice I've only got the three steps here,\nright, fast.\n\n845\n00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,800\nThree step and seven step.\n\n846\n00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,850\nThe fast one here is actually one.\n\n847\n00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,090\nSo one step, one set of zeros.\n\n848\n00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,590\nWhen I did the drive, when I go to erase.\n\n849\n00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,290\nWhoop, wait, shoot.\n\n850\n00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,010\nThat's not what I wanted.\n\n851\n00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:14,010\nWhen I go to Security Options,\nthere we go, I've got four steps, okay?\n\n852\n00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:19,580\nWell this one, the second step, that's one\nzero, then three zero, then seven zero.\n\n853\n00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,430\nFastest on this screen\ndoesn't actually write zeros.\n\n854\n00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,590\nIt just flags the data as deleted.\n\n855\n00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,520\nSo it doesn't even bother writing zeros.\n\n856\n00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,680\nBut Apple figured if you're gonna go\nthrough the trouble to erase free space,\n\n857\n00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,720\nyou at least want to\nwrite one set of zeros.\n\n858\n00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,130\nSo we don't have that first option\nhere which is to flag it as deleted.\n\n859\n00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,980\nIf it's free space,\nit's already been flagged as deleted\n\n860\n00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,470\notherwise it wouldn't be free space,\nright.\n\n861\n00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:43,140\nSo that's why we don't\nsee that other option.\n\n862\n00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,810\nAnd from here we can bump it from one pass\n\n863\n00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:48,730\nto three passes to seven passes,\nall right.\n\n864\n00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:51,710\nNow, one pass is going to take\na certain amount of time.\n\n865\n00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,970\nThree passes will take\nthree times that and\n\n866\n00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:56,090\nseven passes will take seven times that.\n\n867\n00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,440\nSo, it gets longer and longer.\n\n868\n00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,370\nThis drive is 250 gigs.\n\n869\n00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:03,772\nI've got about 12 gigs of data\non it somewhere around there and\n\n870\n00:44:03,772 --> 00:44:08,308\nthat means that if I'm gonna wipe out 12\ngigs, or the remainder of the space, which\n\n871\n00:44:08,308 --> 00:44:12,845\nwould be 230 some odd gigs of space It's\ngotta write zeros to 230 gigs of space.\n\n872\n00:44:12,845 --> 00:44:13,450\nThat's gonna take awhile.\n\n873\n00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,650\nI'm gonna go ahead and do it.\n\n874\n00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,012\nI'll hit Erase Free Space.\n\n875\n00:44:16,012 --> 00:44:18,010\nAnd it's gonna start doing that,\nall right?\n\n876\n00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,460\nSee how down here it says\ncreating a temporary file.\n\n877\n00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,810\nThat's writing a zero.\n\n878\n00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,290\nIt's writing a zero across all that space.\n\n879\n00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,800\nAnd it's telling me it's gonna\ntake less than a minute.\n\n880\n00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,850\nWell that's good.\n\n881\n00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,380\nLess than a minute, that's not bad.\n\n882\n00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,630\nBut if you have a three terabyte\ndrive with a ton of free space,\n\n883\n00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:33,980\nthis can take hours.\n\n884\n00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,230\nIt can take a long time\nto clear that data out.\n\n885\n00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:41,310\nIn my case it's this USB 2.0 drive,\nit's reaching over to it and wiping it.\n\n886\n00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,250\nAnd it's going to take about a minute.\n\n887\n00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:48,624\nAll right, now, the cool part here is If\nyour drive is encrypted with File Vault,\n\n888\n00:44:48,624 --> 00:44:52,341\nthis free space that's containing\ndata that's unencrypted,\n\n889\n00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:53,886\nthis is going to erase it.\n\n890\n00:44:53,886 --> 00:44:55,490\nRight, this is gonna wipe it out.\n\n891\n00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,140\nAnd as you put new data in there,\nthat new data will be encrypted and\n\n892\n00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:02,150\nit will be protected, but\nyour old data will be removed.\n\n893\n00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,180\nSo this gives you that safety.\n\n894\n00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,920\nIf you've been using Your Mac.\n\n895\n00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,410\nIf you've actually got data already\non it you turn on File Vault.\n\n896\n00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:14,110\nYour existing data is safe,\nyour deleted data is not.\n\n897\n00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,700\nSo your next step would be to come and\ndo this.\n\n898\n00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,290\nAll right.\n\n899\n00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,020\nNow, SSDs are different.\n\n900\n00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:23,490\nNotice if I pick my SSD up here, so\nthis one down here is the USB drive, and\n\n901\n00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,870\nit's traditional SATA, but\nif I come up and I choose, oh, shoot.\n\n902\n00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:27,950\nIt's gonna make me wait.\n\n903\n00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:31,810\nWell, if I come up and I choose the SSD,\nwhat would happen if I\n\n904\n00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:35,660\nwas a man of more patience,\nis the Erase button would be there.\n\n905\n00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,040\nI could still erase it.\n\n906\n00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,730\nBut the erase free space wouldn't be there\nand it would say this type of drive is not\n\n907\n00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:44,210\nsupported so the SSD's aren't\nsupported for this, all right?\n\n908\n00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,550\nIn my case it's going racing, and\n\n909\n00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,540\nactually it just jumped up\nto 16 minutes which is fun.\n\n910\n00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,386\nSo it just jumped up there.\n\n911\n00:45:49,386 --> 00:45:50,261\nI'm not gonna wait for that.\n\n912\n00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:52,637\nI'm just going to hit Skip and\nwe'll stop that.\n\n913\n00:45:52,637 --> 00:45:56,495\nI don't have 16 minutes of patience in me.\n\n914\n00:45:56,495 --> 00:46:00,915\nBut if go up here to my SSD, I can't erase\nthis one because it's my system drive,\n\n915\n00:46:00,915 --> 00:46:03,775\nI actually boot up off of it, so\nthat's why I don't have it, but\n\n916\n00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,695\nif I choose the volume,\nsee these are just staying grayed out.\n\n917\n00:46:06,695 --> 00:46:12,525\nIt's again not supported on the SSD,\nso I can't do it there.\n\n918\n00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,690\nAlso, same thing with like DMGs, right?\n\n919\n00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,200\nSo here I have a disk image.\n\n920\n00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,480\nAnd you don't even have the erase option,\ncuz it doesn't make sense to erase a DMG.\n\n921\n00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,920\nSo there's certain types of\nstorage where you won't see that.\n\n922\n00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,845\nBut on your magnetic storage, you will,\nand that's what we're seeing right here.\n\n923\n00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:32,540\nAll right, there's one other\nthing that I wanna mention.\n\n924\n00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,510\nThis is tackling all of our free space,\nall right?\n\n925\n00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:40,320\nWell if you're aware of this,\nif you know that deleting a file doesn't\n\n926\n00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,420\nactually delete it,\nthat it leaves some remnants behind.\n\n927\n00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:49,100\nYou might want to ensure that this\nhappens on an ongoing basis, okay?\n\n928\n00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,790\nWell the problem really rises\nwhen you empty your trash,\n\n929\n00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:55,920\nwhen I delete a file\nthe file goes into my trash.\n\n930\n00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,240\nWell, let me show you what I mean here.\n\n931\n00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,080\nSo if I go to my USB drive, and\nI'll take this Yosemite disk here.\n\n932\n00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,900\nAnd I'm just going to move it to my trash.\n\n933\n00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,400\nSo it's in the trash.\n\n934\n00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,360\nIf I go and empty my trash right now.\n\n935\n00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,850\nLet me just bring up my trash.\n\n936\n00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,130\nHere's my trash.\n\n937\n00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,980\nIf I go and empty my trash right now,\nthat's gonna get flagged as deleted.\n\n938\n00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,720\nBut the magnetic signature\nwill still be there, and\n\n939\n00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,310\nsomebody could recover the file, right?\n\n940\n00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:26,740\nWell I could choose to do a secure\nempty of my trash, alright?\n\n941\n00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,460\nA lot of people don't\nknow about this option.\n\n942\n00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,910\nWhen you're in your trash like this,\nyou can go up to the Finder menu, and\n\n943\n00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:37,340\nunder Finder you've got Empty Trash,\nand Secure Empty Trash.\n\n944\n00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,850\nYou don't actually have to be\nin the trash to get there.\n\n945\n00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,040\nI can just be right here on my\nmain screen and go to Finder and\n\n946\n00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,580\nyou've got Secure Empty Trash.\n\n947\n00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:48,084\nAnd what that's gonna do is it's gonna\ndelete the items in the trash bin and\n\n948\n00:47:48,084 --> 00:47:52,170\nit's gonna write zeroes to\nthe sectors where they were stored\n\n949\n00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,640\nto give you that security.\n\n950\n00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,070\nSo I can choose Secure Empty Trash,\nand here it goes giving me a warning.\n\n951\n00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:02,208\nI can choose to do it, and now it's\ngonna securely delete those files.\n\n952\n00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:04,625\nInstead of doing all of my free space,\n\n953\n00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:07,501\nhere it's just doing it\nas I delete the data.\n\n954\n00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:11,970\nSo if you make a habit of this, every\ntime I empty the trash do a secure empty.\n\n955\n00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:16,201\nWell, at that point you really wouldn't\nneed to scrub all your free space because\n\n956\n00:48:16,201 --> 00:48:18,980\nwhat's in your free space\nwould already be zero now.\n\n957\n00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,310\nThe only negative is that it\ndidn't give us choices here.\n\n958\n00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:25,380\nWe didn't get to pick three passes,\nseven passes, it just does one pass.\n\n959\n00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,600\nIf that one pass isn't enough,\nthen you'll probably want to go and\n\n960\n00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,760\ndo the manual free space anyway.\n\n961\n00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,530\nSo, there's that.\n\n962\n00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:38,560\nBut, once the drive has FileVault on\nit anything new is being encrypted.\n\n963\n00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,380\nSo even if the encrypted data\nis residual on the drive,\n\n964\n00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,350\nit's safe because it's encrypted.\n\n965\n00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:47,000\nSo really you should only have\nto purge your free space once.\n\n966\n00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,620\nTurn on FileVault, purge the free space.\n\n967\n00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,350\nRight?\nOr you can purge the free space before you\n\n968\n00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,340\nturn on FileVault.\n\n969\n00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,040\nDoesn't matter what order you do it in.\n\n970\n00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,020\nBut once FileVault is on and\nyou've purged that free space once,\n\n971\n00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,560\nyou're safe, you're covered.\n\n972\n00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,898\nSo you shouldn't need to do it anymore.\n\n973\n00:49:00,898 --> 00:49:02,554\nAll right.\n\n974\n00:49:02,554 --> 00:49:06,630\n[LAUGH] So the guys in the chatroom\n\n975\n00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:09,360\nposted a couple of things like\nthe Microsoft Coffee Software,\n\n976\n00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,610\nwhich is forensic software for\nlifting that data off the drive.\n\n977\n00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:13,810\nIt works.\n\n978\n00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:17,450\nIf you're involved in the US Government or\nany kind of law enforcement agency,\n\n979\n00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:19,940\nMicrosoft makes that\nsoftware available for free.\n\n980\n00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,090\nThere's plenty of third\nparty software out there.\n\n981\n00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,790\nI mentioned like Disk Warrior.\n\n982\n00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:27,710\nI think it costs $100 and\nit'll scan a drive and recover data.\n\n983\n00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:32,140\nBut the only truly safe mechanism to\nprotect the data once it's deleted\n\n984\n00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,250\nis to shred the hard drive.\n\n985\n00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:37,750\nAnd those commercial shredders can just, I\nmean they just annihilate that hard drive.\n\n986\n00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,240\nAnd it becomes impossible\nto get the data off of it.\n\n987\n00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,820\nSo tons of different approaches out there.\n\n988\n00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,280\nEach one kind of achieves the same goal.\n\n989\n00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:46,970\nAll right.\n\n990\n00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,590\nWell, I think that's the last thing.\n\n991\n00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,550\nDid I have anything else here on my notes?\n\n992\n00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:51,740\nLet's see.\nNope.\n\n993\n00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,750\nJust that it takes a long\ntime to erase the free space.\n\n994\n00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:58,150\nSo, all right, so let's recap what\nwe talked about in this episode.\n\n995\n00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:00,780\nWe started off talking about\nthe Legacy FileVault, and\n\n996\n00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,490\nhow it just encrypts your home folder,\nwhich is not necessarily perfect.\n\n997\n00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,635\nThen we talked about\nFileVault version two.\n\n998\n00:50:07,635 --> 00:50:11,545\nThe new file vault and how it encrypts\nthe entire disc, and that's much better.\n\n999\n00:50:11,545 --> 00:50:14,805\nWe also saw how to recover in the event\nthat we lose our password, or\n\n1000\n00:50:14,805 --> 00:50:16,665\nwe don't have access to our own account.\n\n1001\n00:50:16,665 --> 00:50:19,115\nTo be able to get into our drive again.\n\n1002\n00:50:19,115 --> 00:50:22,355\nAnd then lastly we talked about\nfree space and deleted items.\n\n1003\n00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:26,535\nHow to erase the free space of a drive,\nto wipe out residual data.\n\n1004\n00:50:26,535 --> 00:50:29,095\nAnd how to securely empty our trash.\n\n1005\n00:50:29,095 --> 00:50:31,870\nRight.\nAll different ways to ensure that our data\n\n1006\n00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:33,310\nstays safe, and\n\n1007\n00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:36,480\nthat only the people we want to have\naccess get access to it, right?\n\n1008\n00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,630\nWe prevent attackers and malicious parties\nfrom being able to get to our data.\n\n1009\n00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:40,460\nIt's pretty important.\n\n1010\n00:50:41,732 --> 00:50:43,760\nAll right, well,\nthat's about it for this show.\n\n1011\n00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,000\nSo this is a good spot for\nus to wrap it up.\n\n1012\n00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,010\nLet me remind you guys,\nif you have questions on any of this,\n\n1013\n00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:50,810\nfeel free to ask.\n\n1014\n00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,390\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live and\n\n1015\n00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:57,150\nyou'll see the chatroom beneath the video,\npost your

right.\nGood morning, good afternoon and\n\n5\n00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,990\ngood evening and welcome back\nto another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,730\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,610\nBack again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n8\n00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,080\nWe're gonna be diving right back into\ntopic three, kind of where we've been\n\n9\n00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,040\ndwelling the last few episodes, as we look\nat our file systems, our disks, and so on.\n\n10\n00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,760\nIn this episode, I wanna focus\nspecifically on file permissions.\n\n11\n00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,460\nFor your average end-user, file\npermissions aren't something they think\n\n12\n00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,440\nabout, but under the hood underneath\nthe nice visual interface that\n\n13\n00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,050\nwe have in Mac OS, we've got BSD,\na Unix-like operating system.\n\n14\n00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,730\nAnd in Unix, file permissions are really,\nreally important.\n\n15\n00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,150\nEvery single aspect of your computer\nis represented as a file, and\n\n16\n00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,410\nthe file permissions are what determines\nwho's allowed to access those files.\n\n17\n00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,410\nAnd if you can access them,\nwhat are you allowed to do to them, right,\n\n18\n00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,850\ndifferent levels of\naccess that are provided.\n\n19\n00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,000\nNow for most end users the default\npermissions are perfectly fine,\n\n20\n00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560\nthey never mess with it,\nthey never even think about it.\n\n21\n00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,360\nYeah, I've got a text document\nsaved on my desktop or\n\n22\n00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,580\na picture saved in my photo's folder.\n\n23\n00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,790\nI don't care what the file permissions\nare, can I open the file, great!\n\n24\n00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,760\nThat's all I care about, right?\n\n25\n00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,141\nAnd that's how most end users are,\nthis is something they don't worry about.\n\n26\n00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:48,561\nBut there are times when we might\nwant to adjust those permissions,\n\n27\n00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:51,501\nto change peoples access, or\nwe might need to do repairs,\n\n28\n00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:54,681\nwe might need to fix problems\nwith those file permissions, and\n\n29\n00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,867\nthat's where being a support\nprofessional comes in, right?\n\n30\n00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,123\nWe've got to be able to go in there and\ncorrect that, and\n\n31\n00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:02,420\nget things up to the way that we need.\n\n32\n00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,960\nSo I wanna talk a little bit about what\nthose permissions are, how they work,\n\n33\n00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,840\nhow we see them, how we modify them.\n\n34\n00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,730\nAnd then the ways that we fix them\nlater on if we need to, okay?\n\n35\n00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,810\nWell first off let me show you\nwhat I mean by file permissions.\n\n36\n00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,780\nI've got a Mac running Yosemite fired up\nright here and if I just fire up something\n\n37\n00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,440\nreally simple like here we'll\njust use the old text edit.\n\n38\n00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,520\nAnd I'm going to create\na text file real quick.\n\n39\n00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,690\nSo this is a sample file.\n\n40\n00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,690\nAnd I'll save that.\n\n41\n00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,080\nAnd I'm just gonna save this one\nright up to my documents folder.\n\n42\n00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,820\nThat's a good place to put it.\n\n43\n00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,140\nAnd I'll just call this like sample.txt or\nactually it's a rich text document so\n\n44\n00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,450\nI'll call it rtf.\n\n45\n00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,180\nAnd we'll save it.\n\n46\n00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,480\nThere we go, all right.\n\n47\n00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,240\nSo I just created a file and\nif I go in my Finder and\n\n48\n00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,770\nI go into my Documents folder\nI'll find it right there.\n\n49\n00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,280\nThere it is.\n\n50\n00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,850\nI created it, it's there.\n\n51\n00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,550\nThat file has a set of permissions on it.\n\n52\n00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,240\nAnd the permissions identify\nall sorts of things.\n\n53\n00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,030\nOne of the key things they indicate,\nis who the owner is.\n\n54\n00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,370\nThe owner of a file is\nthe person who made it.\n\n55\n00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,570\nI made this file, so I'm the owner.\n\n56\n00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,100\nIt belongs to me.\n\n57\n00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,700\nAnd that means that I can\nchange it however I want.\n\n58\n00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,690\nAnd that's the main reason people\ndon't care about permissions because\n\n59\n00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,930\nif you create your own documents and\nyou have full access, that's all you need.\n\n60\n00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,390\nThe rest of it is kind of irrelevant.\n\n61\n00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,990\nRight?\n\n62\n00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,190\nSo, for me I never saw those permissions,\nI never saw any prompts about it,\n\n63\n00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,030\nI just created a document and saved it and\nit's automatically tied to me.\n\n64\n00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,650\nNow how do I know that it's tied to me?\n\n65\n00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,040\nWell, if I pull up the information about\nthat file, either by right-clicking and\n\n66\n00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,290\ndoing Get Info or Cmd+I is the same thing.\n\n67\n00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,540\nWe can go into the information on\nthe file and you'll see details about it.\n\n68\n00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,470\nAnd as I look down, I can see things\nlike a preview and other things.\n\n69\n00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,150\nAnd this very last part right here\nsays Sharing and Permissions.\n\n70\n00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,930\nAnd if I expand that out,\n\n71\n00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,140\nright there I'll see the permissions\nthat are assigned to this.\n\n72\n00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,925\nAnd I can see that I, Don Pezet,\nhave read and write access to it and\n\n73\n00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:09,480\nstaff has read-only, and\neveryone has read-only.\n\n74\n00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,370\nI didn't assign that.\n\n75\n00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,650\nI didn't tell it to do that,\nit did it on it's own, all right.\n\n76\n00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,900\nWhat am I looking at right there?\n\n77\n00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,572\nBy default, your file will be accessible\nto three different types of people,\n\n78\n00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:21,620\nall right.\n\n79\n00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,390\nThe first one, is what's called the owner.\n\n80\n00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,080\nAnd that's that first one\nthat we're seeing right here.\n\n81\n00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,300\nIt's a single person,\nit's got the little head icon on it.\n\n82\n00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,280\nAnd it'll say that person's name.\n\n83\n00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,630\nI created this, so it shows up as me.\n\n84\n00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,600\nDon Pezet, I'm the owner.\n\n85\n00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,530\nAnd the owner has full\ncontrol of that file,\n\n86\n00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,730\nthey can do whatever\nthey want to the file.\n\n87\n00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,320\nAnd the way that's represented\nhere is as a privilege.\n\n88\n00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,300\nNow, in Mac OS, privilege and permission\nare basically interchangeable orders.\n\n89\n00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,967\nIn some other operating systems out there\nthey aren't, they're separate ideas, but\n\n90\n00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,059\nhere inside of Mac OS they're combined,\nright?\n\n91\n00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:57,850\nSo when I see privilege,\nthat's actually a permission.\n\n92\n00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,730\nThis user Don Pezet has the privilege\nof reading and writing to that file.\n\n93\n00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,640\nSo that's the owner, a single person.\n\n94\n00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,110\nThe next one is called the group,\nand the group here is staff.\n\n95\n00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,990\nAll right, what is that group?\n\n96\n00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,180\nI don't remember creating that group.\n\n97\n00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,310\nIn fact, if we go into System Preferences,\nand we go into Users and Groups and\n\n98\n00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,310\nI take a look at my groups, I don't\neven have a group called staff, right?\n\n99\n00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,150\nIf I were to create a group, and\nhere I'll just whip one up real quick.\n\n100\n00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,290\nIf I just unlock that screen,\nbecause it's an admin privilege.\n\n101\n00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,550\nI can go here to add, and I can add\na group, so I'm going to come in here and\n\n102\n00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,390\njust choose to add a group,\nand I'll call this Employees.\n\n103\n00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,030\nThis is where I'll put all my employees,\nall right.\n\n104\n00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,980\nNotice how I see employees\nright here under groups.\n\n105\n00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,710\nI don't see a group called staff.\n\n106\n00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,010\nWhat's that all about?\n\n107\n00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,960\nWell, there's actually\na default group created when\n\n108\n00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,320\nyou install Mac OS that you don't see.\n\n109\n00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,500\nIt's hidden.\n\n110\n00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,320\nIt's kind of like the root user account.\n\n111\n00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,920\nThere's an administrator account called\nroot that's created automatically when you\n\n112\n00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,650\ninstall Mac OS.\n\n113\n00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,540\nIt's hidden, so\nI don't see it in this list.\n\n114\n00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,920\nThe staff group is the same way,\nand unless you've modified it,\n\n115\n00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,060\nby default, the staff group will\ninclude all users on your computer.\n\n116\n00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,891\nSo see how I've got this user,\nDon Pezet, and I'm an admin, right.\n\n117\n00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:28,710\nBut if I add another user, I'll add just\na standard user which I'll call John Doe.\n\n118\n00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:33,410\nAll right so here's this\nJohn Doe user that I'm creating.\n\n119\n00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:41,242\nAnd when I create this user it's going to\nautomatically put them in the staff group.\n\n120\n00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:44,740\nAll right this hidden group, they're\nautomatically going to be a member of it.\n\n121\n00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,791\nAnd if I create another user, so\nthat was John Doe, I'll create a Jane Doe.\n\n122\n00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,710\nAnd I'll assign a password.\n\n123\n00:06:57,264 --> 00:07:00,500\nAll right, so now I've got John Doe and\nJane Doe, standard users.\n\n124\n00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,390\nThey're both in the Staff group.\n\n125\n00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,430\nSo what we're looking\nat over here is saying,\n\n126\n00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,250\nwhat permissions does everybody\nelse on your computer get?\n\n127\n00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,790\nAll right.\n\n128\n00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,740\nNow this includes local users.\n\n129\n00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,810\nWe haven't tackled network users yet, ones\nthat are stored in an open directory or\n\n130\n00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,310\nactive directory environment.\n\n131\n00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,750\nThis is talking about local users.\n\n132\n00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,100\nThe ones right here on this computer\nlike John and Jane Doe, all right.\n\n133\n00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,950\nSo they are both going to\nbe in that staff group and\n\n134\n00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,390\nI can see that they are getting read only.\n\n135\n00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,780\nThat means that by default John Doe and\nJane Doe,\n\n136\n00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,820\nif they have access to this file,\nwill be able to read it.\n\n137\n00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,290\nThey won't be able to write to it.\n\n138\n00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,190\nThey won't be able to change it.\n\n139\n00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,730\nBut they'll have read access.\n\n140\n00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,970\nMaybe I don't want that.\n\n141\n00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,890\nI might not want them to have that access,\nso I can go and modify that and change it.\n\n142\n00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,230\nAnd it's easy enough, right?\n\n143\n00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:48,080\nWe just click on these, and you can change\nthat value to something else, right?\n\n144\n00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,601\nOr you can remove it outright with\nthe little minus sign right here.\n\n145\n00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:54,793\nPlus and minus for\nadding additional values and\n\n146\n00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:58,555\nremoving values to adjust\nthose default permissions.\n\n147\n00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:01,075\nAnd then, lastly, we've got everyone.\n\n148\n00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:04,058\nAll right, the first entry was the owner.\n\n149\n00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:06,270\nThe second entry was the group.\n\n150\n00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,170\nThe third entry is what's called other.\n\n151\n00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,240\nAll right so it's owner, group, other.\n\n152\n00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,420\nThis third one other is represented\nin the GUI here as everyone.\n\n153\n00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,110\nAnd everyone just means anybody who\ndidn't fit the first two categories.\n\n154\n00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,290\nSo if you're not Don Pizet,\n\n155\n00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,530\nand you're not in the staff group,\nthen you fall under everyone, all right.\n\n156\n00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,310\nThis would include guest users, right,\n\n157\n00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,220\nusers that are logged in with\nthat temporary guest account.\n\n158\n00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,980\nThis would included network users,\n\n159\n00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,190\npeople coming in over the network\nto access your machine.\n\n160\n00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,710\nSo this would be everybody else, right.\n\n161\n00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,660\nAnd the default permission here\nis read-only also, all right.\n\n162\n00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,760\nIt's been given this default access\nto be able to read from a file,\n\n163\n00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,770\nbut not actually write to it.\n\n164\n00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,160\nAnd I can manipulate those permissions\nif I want, a lot of times you will.\n\n165\n00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,550\nSo you can change those or whatever, but\n\n166\n00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,540\nthese are kinda the default\npermissions that we expect to see.\n\n167\n00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,420\nThese are happening behind the scenes,\nautomatically.\n\n168\n00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,530\nSo you don't have to do this,\nyou don't have to go in and set these,\n\n169\n00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,620\nyou can just let Mac OS handle it, and\n\n170\n00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,100\nthe default permissions will\nactually work out pretty well.\n\n171\n00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,790\nLater on in the show I'm gonna walk you\nthrough what the default permissions\n\n172\n00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,140\nare in your home folder, so\nthat you can see how it is secured.\n\n173\n00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,810\nI know this might not seem secure,\nlike, everyone has read only access,\n\n174\n00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,600\nthat means everybody in\nthe world can read my stuff?\n\n175\n00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,950\nWell, not really,\nthere's limitations to whose even able\n\n176\n00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,030\nto access your computer that make this\na lot more restrictive than it looks.\n\n177\n00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,880\nSo don't panic, if you look at it and go\nwait a minute, Mac OS is really unsecure,\n\n178\n00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,950\nit's not that bad, there's other things\nthat work in conjunction with this.\n\n179\n00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,720\nBut these are the permissions and\n\n180\n00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,740\nI'm showing them here to you on a file,\nfolders have them too.\n\n181\n00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,080\nInside of My Documents,\nif I create a new folder.\n\n182\n00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,800\nSo, I might have a folder for tax returns.\n\n183\n00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,770\nHere in the US it's tax season right now,\nso\n\n184\n00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,960\nwe'll start to keep our\ntax returns right there.\n\n185\n00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,480\nIf you pull up the information for\n\n186\n00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,270\nthat folder,\nyou'll see that it has permissions also.\n\n187\n00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,490\nBut the permissions take\non a slightly different\n\n188\n00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,600\naspect when they are applied to\na folder than they do to a file.\n\n189\n00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,360\nThere are little variations\nin how they work.\n\n190\n00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,960\nNow what we are looking at here,\n\n191\n00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,030\nare the permissions via\nthe Graphical User Interface, the GUI.\n\n192\n00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,320\nThese are made to be friendly and\neasy to work with.\n\n193\n00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,270\nBut at the end of the day,\n\n194\n00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,340\nit's really applying these down at\nthe UNIX level behind the scenes.\n\n195\n00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,490\nSo when it comes to\nworking with permissions,\n\n196\n00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:32,150\nyou can use the GUI just like this,\nor you can use the Mac OS terminal.\n\n197\n00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,470\nIf I fire up my terminal, and you know,\nmy font's gonna be microscopic here.\n\n198\n00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,670\nLet me bump that up.\n\n199\n00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,590\nLet's see, we will go to a much,\nmuch larger font, so\n\n200\n00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,900\nwe can actually read what\nthe heck is going on here.\n\n201\n00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,770\nThat's a little bit better.\n\n202\n00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:54,500\nAll right.\n\n203\n00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,190\nSo when we fire up our console, and\n\n204\n00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,990\nwe take a look at a directory,\nlike here's my home directory.\n\n205\n00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,020\nAnd there's that Documents folder, I can\nget into the documents folder, right.\n\n206\n00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,950\nAnd there's Sample.rtf,\nand my Tax Returns folder.\n\n207\n00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,660\nSo I see them both right there.\n\n208\n00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,690\nThose are the things I just created in\nthe Graphical User Interface, all right.\n\n209\n00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,910\nBy default, when I do the list command,\n\n210\n00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,240\nls, I don't see the permissions\nthat are assigned to that.\n\n211\n00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,370\nBut if I add a little bit more to it.\n\n212\n00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,230\nIf I do ls-l,\nthat means give me the long output, right.\n\n213\n00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,450\nThe long output includes the permissions.\n\n214\n00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,010\nAnd I can see those\npermissions listed right here.\n\n215\n00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,060\nNow, the permissions are written in\na really unusual way, here in the GUI.\n\n216\n00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,060\nYou get all these different\nvalues being represented.\n\n217\n00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,460\nAnd the way they're structured kind\nof assumes you already know what each\n\n218\n00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,630\none means, and a lot of us don't.\n\n219\n00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,220\nSo, let's break down\nexactly what those mean.\n\n220\n00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,130\nAnd actually I'm gonna go\na little bit bigger on this font,\n\n221\n00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,500\ncuz I really wanna make sure\neverybody can see this.\n\n222\n00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,050\nIt is important for the exam.\n\n223\n00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,220\nWe'll go super big.\n\n224\n00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,750\nThere we go.\nAll right so\n\n225\n00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,260\neach file is listed with this little\nblock of permissions right here, okay.\n\n226\n00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,550\nAnd the block basically is a series of\ndashes, there's ten dashes by default and\n\n227\n00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,240\neach dash represents a placeholder for\na permission, all right.\n\n228\n00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,710\nThe very first dash is actually\nnot a permission but a descriptor.\n\n229\n00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,060\nIt lets us know whether this is a file or\na folder.\n\n230\n00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,670\nIf it's a file,\nthat very first dash will be a dash.\n\n231\n00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,404\nIf it's a folder,\nthe very first dash will be a d, and\n\n232\n00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:38,600\nthe d means directory, all right.\n\n233\n00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,240\nSo if you're a file, you'll have a dash.\n\n234\n00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,220\nIf you're a folder,\nyou'll have a d for directory.\n\n235\n00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,130\nAnd that's exactly what I see,\nthe tax returns starts with a d,\n\n236\n00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,555\nletting me know it's a directory.\n\n237\n00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:49,600\nSample.rtf starts with a dash,\nletting me know it's a file.\n\n238\n00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,370\nThe next nine values though,\nare all about permissions.\n\n239\n00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,122\nAnd the way it works is this,\nyou have read, write,\n\n240\n00:13:00,122 --> 00:13:04,020\nexecute, rwx, read, write, execute.\n\n241\n00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,400\nAnd those are the three\npermissions that we assigned.\n\n242\n00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,720\nNow remember in the graphical\nuser interface we had read only\n\n243\n00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,847\nand read and write, okay.\n\n244\n00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,470\nThose would be the r and the w.\n\n245\n00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,220\nThat execute flag doesn't\nshow up in the GUI, okay.\n\n246\n00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,160\nAnd that's because the execute flag is\nreally only necessary for applications,\n\n247\n00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,660\nfor programs, right.\n\n248\n00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,080\nLet me just kind of run\nover each of these,\n\n249\n00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,670\nto make sure everybody\nunderstands the permissions.\n\n250\n00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,490\nRead, read means that you can open a file,\nand look at it's contents.\n\n251\n00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,960\nIf read permissions are assigned\nto a file, you can open it and\n\n252\n00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,400\nsee what’s inside it.\n\n253\n00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,250\nIf it’s a folder,\nyou can open the folder and\n\n254\n00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,390\nget a list of files that are inside of it.\n\n255\n00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,125\nWhen I'm in the finder,\nwhen I'm browsing my hard drive here, and\n\n256\n00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:57,300\nI go to the desktop folder or\nthe downloads folder, I'm using the read\n\n257\n00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,050\npermission on the Documents folder to list\nall the files inside of it, all right.\n\n258\n00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,510\nThat's what read means on a folder.\n\n259\n00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,410\nRead on a file means I can double-click\non it and see what's inside it, right,\n\n260\n00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,310\nI have read access.\n\n261\n00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,900\nWrite means, not only can I open it and\nsee what's inside it, but\n\n262\n00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,560\nI can change it and save it.\n\n263\n00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,050\nOr I can create all new things.\n\n264\n00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:27,330\nSo, for example, if I have write access\nto this file, right here, I can open it,\n\n265\n00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:34,250\nI can make some changes,\nand then I can save it.\n\n266\n00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,450\nAnd I'll save that file, there we go.\n\n267\n00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,310\nSaved, and now it's updated.\n\n268\n00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,360\nAll right, I had write permissions.\n\n269\n00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,870\nIf I have write permissions to a folder,\nlike this tax returns folder, that means\n\n270\n00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:54,810\nthat I can open it up and actually put\nsomething new in there, all right.\n\n271\n00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:00,130\nSo I might want to copy\nmy sample file here and\n\n272\n00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,180\ncome into tax returns and paste it.\n\n273\n00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,990\nI'm creating something new.\n\n274\n00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,300\nThat's what write permissions\non a folder lets you do.\n\n275\n00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,679\nYou can create new items in there.\n\n276\n00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,210\nExecute, on the other hand,\nexecute means you can run a program.\n\n277\n00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,500\nIf this file was an application,\nor if this file was a script,\n\n278\n00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,580\nlike a shell script, or\na PERL script, Python,\n\n279\n00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,510\nsomething like that, if I had execute\npermission, I'd be able to run it.\n\n280\n00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,390\nNow most of the time we don't want\nexecute permissions on something.\n\n281\n00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,990\nIf this is a text file,\ndo I need execute permissions on that, no.\n\n282\n00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,000\nAnd so normally we don't worry about that.\n\n283\n00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,520\nAny applications that we throw\ninto our applications folder\n\n284\n00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,050\nwill automatically get\nthose execute permissions.\n\n285\n00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,300\nThat's why, if you ever wondered,\nwhen you go to install software,\n\n286\n00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,140\nwhat are you doing.\n\n287\n00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,189\nYou're really just dragging it and\ndropping it into the Applications folder.\n\n288\n00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:52,577\nAnd when you do that, it's getting\nthe execute permission automatically.\n\n289\n00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:56,292\nIt's getting it assigned to that program\nso that you'll be able to run and use it.\n\n290\n00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:56,897\nAll right.\n\n291\n00:15:56,897 --> 00:16:01,405\nSo that's a pretty big difference there\nbetween just a regular document and\n\n292\n00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:03,810\none that can actually run and do things.\n\n293\n00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,640\nThat's executing.\n\n294\n00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,730\nNow, in my terminal, when I look at these\npermissions I see them in blocks of three.\n\n295\n00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,580\nRead, write, execute.\n\n296\n00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,860\nRead, write, execute,\nread, write, execute, okay?\n\n297\n00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,400\nThink of this way.\n\n298\n00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,640\nThe first three applies\nto the owner of the file.\n\n299\n00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,340\nWho is that created the file itself?\n\n300\n00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,950\nThe next three apply to the group.\n\n301\n00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,440\nWhat group permissions are there?\n\n302\n00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,160\nRight, like staff, for example.\n\n303\n00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,270\nAnd then the last three\napply to the other.\n\n304\n00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,950\nThe other, that would be everyone.\n\n305\n00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,400\nWhat access does everyone have?\n\n306\n00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,810\nAnd so looking at sample.rtf here,\nI can see that the owner,\n\n307\n00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,480\nwhich I can see who the owner is\nright here, the owner is Don Pezet.\n\n308\n00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,163\nAnd the owner has rw-.\n\n309\n00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:56,330\nI have read, write, and not execute.\n\n310\n00:16:57,638 --> 00:17:01,430\nThen the group,and I can\nsee the group is staff.\n\n311\n00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,730\nStaff has read but\nnot write and not execute.\n\n312\n00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,770\nAll right so, just read or read only.\n\n313\n00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,040\nAnd then everyone else and I don't need\na column to identify who everyone is,\n\n314\n00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,910\nhas read access and\nnothing else, all right.\n\n315\n00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,560\nAnd if I compare that with\nwhat we had in the GUI,\n\n316\n00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,620\nDon Pezet had read and write, staff\nhad read only, everyone had read only.\n\n317\n00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,370\nThat matches up with what\nwe see in the command line.\n\n318\n00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,260\nAll right, this is the Unix way,\nor really it's the POSIX way.\n\n319\n00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,500\nPOSIX is what defines these permissions.\n\n320\n00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,170\nBut it's the Unix and\n\n321\n00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:43,130\nPOSIX way of representing those\npermissions on a particular file, right?\n\n322\n00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,500\nAnd it's a key function of\nthe operating system under the hood.\n\n323\n00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,600\nThis is how it allows people to safely\nstore their files on the same hard drive\n\n324\n00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,980\nand not worry about other\npeople getting them.\n\n325\n00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,180\nIf you share your computer\nwith five other people,\n\n326\n00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,450\nhow do you know your documents are safe?\n\n327\n00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:01,160\nYou can set file permissions on them and\nyou can ensure that they're safe, right?\n\n328\n00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,900\nThat's how we secure our data.\n\n329\n00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,650\nSo important to understand that\nwhat those permissions are.\n\n330\n00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,980\nNow in the GUI we just see read,\nwrite, and execute.\n\n331\n00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,110\nIn the GUI we just see read and write.\n\n332\n00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,890\nThose are the only two that we see.\n\n333\n00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,520\nIn the command line we see read,\nwrite, and execute.\n\n334\n00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,030\nThere are some other special ones that\nare out there that we don't really see.\n\n335\n00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,340\nI will talk about one\nlater in the episode.\n\n336\n00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,920\nBut for right now, those are the main\npermissions that we need to worry about.\n\n337\n00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,400\nRead, write, execute.\n\n338\n00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,970\nAll right,\n\n339\n00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,450\nnow if we wanna modify these permissions,\nhere in the GUI it's super easy.\n\n340\n00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,360\nWe can just go through and tweak that.\n\n341\n00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,850\nIf I've got my tax returns folder,\n\n342\n00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,840\nI probably don't want anybody to\nhave access to it other than me.\n\n343\n00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,290\nIt's my tax returns, just me.\n\n344\n00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,315\nSo I might leave myself with read and\nwrite, okay?\n\n345\n00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:54,130\nBut then staff, this other group,\n\n346\n00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,970\nI don't want them to have a bunch of\naccess, so I might wanna change that.\n\n347\n00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,630\nBut look what I get when I click on that,\nI get Read and\n\n348\n00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,980\nWrite, Read Only and Write Only Dropbox.\n\n349\n00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,600\nAll right?\n\n350\n00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,520\nI'm gonna talk about that Dropbox\nsetting a little bit later.\n\n351\n00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,960\nI don't have the option to\ngive them nothing, right?\n\n352\n00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,360\nThere's no option in here that says,\ntake away their access.\n\n353\n00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,460\nThere actually is,\nit just doesn't show up in this box.\n\n354\n00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,330\nIf you wanna take away somebody's access,\nyou just highlight them here, and\n\n355\n00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,470\nyou remove that access.\n\n356\n00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,110\nNow, with everyone, notice I do have\nthat access, that option, right?\n\n357\n00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,180\nThere's no access option.\n\n358\n00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,820\nI can choose no access, and\nnow everyone has no access.\n\n359\n00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,030\nBut when I choose staff,\nI don't see that option, okay?\n\n360\n00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:43,030\nBut there is a difference here\nbetween the group and the other.\n\n361\n00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,660\nOn other,\nI can set it to no access, right?\n\n362\n00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,210\nI just did.\n\n363\n00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,450\nI fact, if I go and compare that to\nwhat I'm seeing in the command line,\n\n364\n00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:57,420\nif I look at my tax returns a moment ago,\nother had r-x, right?\n\n365\n00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,710\nRead and execute on that folder.\n\n366\n00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,840\nNow, other has nothing.\n\n367\n00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,730\nIt instantly changed that.\n\n368\n00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,990\nAnd so it's already taken effect.\n\n369\n00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,530\nI've removed that access.\n\n370\n00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,900\nBut staff does still have access.\n\n371\n00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:15,440\nSo if I go back here to my GUI, I can take\nthis entry and I can't choose no access.\n\n372\n00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,530\nI don't have that option right.\n\n373\n00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,960\nBut I do have the little minus\nsign that lit up right down here.\n\n374\n00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,250\nI can hit that minus sign and\nit's going to warn me,\n\n375\n00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,930\nI can't do this because I don't have\nthe necessary permission, right?\n\n376\n00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,170\nThe problem here is that\nstaff assignment was done.\n\n377\n00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,170\nBy the system,\nby the operating system, not by me.\n\n378\n00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,670\nI can't override it, all right.\n\n379\n00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,360\nUnless I'm administrator.\n\n380\n00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,440\nNotice that it did let me make changes,\nbut\n\n381\n00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960\nI still have this yellow lock,\nright here at the bottom right.\n\n382\n00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,260\nI can makes changes within the scope of\nmy own access as an owner of this file.\n\n383\n00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,740\nBut as far as changing the functions\nof what the operating system is set,\n\n384\n00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,690\nI can't do that, right?\n\n385\n00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,370\nI have to elevate my privileges.\n\n386\n00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,400\nAnd I can hit this unlock button and\n\n387\n00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,900\nthat's going to give me\nthose elevated privileges.\n\n388\n00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,440\nAnd, oops, If I can remember my password,\n\n389\n00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,680\nthat will give me those elevated\nprivileges to be able to go in and\n\n390\n00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:16,270\nmake more in depth changes like taking\nstaff, and trying to remove it.\n\n391\n00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,830\nAnd now it's gone.\n\n392\n00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,372\nIt's gone.\n\n393\n00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:20,350\nIt's gone, it's out of there.\n\n394\n00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,110\nI still have me, with read and write.\n\n395\n00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,350\nYou don't want to lock yourself out\nof the file, that would be bad.\n\n396\n00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,160\nIt can happen.\n\n397\n00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,860\nYou can lock yourself out of a file.\n\n398\n00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,080\nI'll show you how to fix\nthat later in this episode.\n\n399\n00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,980\nBut it shouldn't, right?\n\n400\n00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,740\nIt should just be\nan accident if it happens.\n\n401\n00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,330\nAnd then everyone has no access.\n\n402\n00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,270\nThat's good and the group is all right,\nwell what effect did that have?\n\n403\n00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,210\nLet's take a look at that\nfrom the command line.\n\n404\n00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,180\nIf I go back to my command line,\n\n405\n00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,230\nI can see that that folder\nis no longer owned by staff.\n\n406\n00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:52,300\nStaff is gone, okay, and it has been\nreplaced by a group called wheel.\n\n407\n00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,728\nWhat the heck is wheel?\n\n408\n00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:55,970\nWell I don't know the history of the name,\n\n409\n00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,070\nI don't know exactly why\nthey came up with wheel.\n\n410\n00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,080\nBut what wheel refers to is,\n\n411\n00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,580\na special group that your system\nadministrators are a part of.\n\n412\n00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,370\nAnd so basically the group has been\nassigned to administrators now.\n\n413\n00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,230\nInstead of staff, which is all of your\nusers, now it's just administrators.\n\n414\n00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:16,236\nAnd on top of that, even though\nit's assigned to administrators,\n\n415\n00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:18,390\nthey get no permissions, right?\n\n416\n00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,900\nI see- - -, I don't see rwx.\n\n417\n00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,040\nSo even though they're administrators,\nthey don't have access.\n\n418\n00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,610\nNow, you can never lock\nan administrator out of your data.\n\n419\n00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,900\nAn administrator can still gain\naccess to that data if they want.\n\n420\n00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,180\nBut by default, they'll be blocked.\n\n421\n00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,530\nSo now, everyone has no access.\n\n422\n00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:43,490\nThe group has no access, and only I as\nthe owner have read, write, and execute.\n\n423\n00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,600\nNow, this folder is a lot more secure and\nlimited just to me.\n\n424\n00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,520\nThat's an example of how we can\neasily manage these permissions and\n\n425\n00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,350\ndo it from the graphical user interface.\n\n426\n00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,440\nNow for most of us in real life land, the\nGUI is probably how we'll do this stuff.\n\n427\n00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,490\nYou just modify it right form here and\nyou're in business.\n\n428\n00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,540\nBut they're are times where you might\nneed to do this from the command line.\n\n429\n00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,050\nAnd so I want to show you\nthe UNIX command line to in and\n\n430\n00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:13,050\nmodify those permissions to change\nthe setting and work with them.\n\n431\n00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,840\nBut I'm running a little low on time for\nthis segment, so\n\n432\n00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,780\nlet's pause and take a break.\n\n433\n00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,200\nAnd when we get back, we'll see the same\nbasic permissions settings, but\n\n434\n00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,700\nfrom the command line instead of the GUI.\n\n435\n00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,657\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n436\n00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:35,020\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n437\n00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,949\nBefore the break, we were taking a look\nat permissions on files and folder, and\n\n438\n00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:41,533\nwe were modifying them\nthrough the user interface,\n\n439\n00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,898\nthe graphical user\ninterface inside of Mac OS.\n\n440\n00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:44,685\nSo that was really easy, right?\n\n441\n00:23:44,685 --> 00:23:48,200\nYou just have a little drop down boxes and\nyou pick the permission, and that's it.\n\n442\n00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,298\nBut now, I wanna take a look at that\nsame activity From the command line.\n\n443\n00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:56,462\nAnd from the command line,\nit's not exactly as easy and\n\n444\n00:23:56,462 --> 00:23:59,500\nconvenient as I'm sure\nyou guys can imagine.\n\n445\n00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,380\nSo if we have something like a set of\nGUI permissions like these, right,\n\n446\n00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,260\njust drop down boxes, we pick what we\nwant and we're in business, right.\n\n447\n00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,450\nFrom the command line,\nit's a little bit different, right.\n\n448\n00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,920\nWhen we look at these files,\n\n449\n00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,990\nbasically what we're seeing\nis the same thing as the GUI.\n\n450\n00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,100\nBut we need to modify them, and\n\n451\n00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,420\nunfortunately we don't have little boxes\nthat we can click on to change things,\n\n452\n00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,330\nthey're just right there and that's it.\n\n453\n00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,110\nSo, we have a special command.\n\n454\n00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,360\nIt's the chmod command.\n\n455\n00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,510\nAnd that command right there will\nlet us modify the permissions\n\n456\n00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,440\nof a file or a folder.\n\n457\n00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,880\nAnd we can change the permissions\nto add and remove things.\n\n458\n00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,290\nNow this command used to be a really\ncomplex command back in the day.\n\n459\n00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:45,610\nYou had to do these numerical conversions\nof permissions, it was a super pain.\n\n460\n00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,200\nBut today, the command is a lot\neasier to use than it used to be.\n\n461\n00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,540\nSo fortunately its not a big\ndeal to go in there and\n\n462\n00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,090\nstart to modify permissions\non a file folder, right.\n\n463\n00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,060\nSo for example,\nlet's say that I've got a file.\n\n464\n00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,190\nAnd maybe I'll just create a new\none here inside of documents,\n\n465\n00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,440\nwhat do I want to create this time?\n\n466\n00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,500\nI could do a picture.\n\n467\n00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,850\nWe'll stick with text files,\nthey're easy to deal with.\n\n468\n00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:18,247\nSo this is a second test file,\nand I'll just save that.\n\n469\n00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:24,011\nAnd you know maybe I'll just make\nthis one a regular text file,\n\n470\n00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:25,590\nis it gonna let me do that?\n\n471\n00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,740\nWe'll leave it rich text, why not.\n\n472\n00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,060\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and\njust save this as Test2, there we go.\n\n473\n00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,790\nSo I've got that Test2 file right there,\nand if I take it and\n\n474\n00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,180\ndo a little command + i\nto get its permissions,\n\n475\n00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,045\nI can see those default permissions\nare all back again, right.\n\n476\n00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:42,885\nI'm the owner, and so\nI have read and write.\n\n477\n00:25:42,885 --> 00:25:45,895\nStaff is the default group,\nit's got read only, and\n\n478\n00:25:45,895 --> 00:25:51,055\neveryone is the default well,\neveryone and they have read only too.\n\n479\n00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:56,263\nAnd from the command line, if I do\nan ls-l, I can see those permissions set\n\n480\n00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:02,620\nright there on that sample file and\non my new Test2, right.\n\n481\n00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,328\nSo, I can see those permissions\nright there in action.\n\n482\n00:26:05,328 --> 00:26:11,290\nIf I wanna modify those permissions,\nI just need to use the chmod command.\n\n483\n00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,280\nAnd the chmod command really\ntakes two pieces of input.\n\n484\n00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,260\nThe first piece of input that we give it,\n\n485\n00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,720\nis who we're modifying\nthe permissions for, all right.\n\n486\n00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,150\nAnd it's represented with a simple letter,\nu, which would be user or the owner,\n\n487\n00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:32,090\nright, g, that's the group, and then o,\nthat's other, or everyone, right.\n\n488\n00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:38,240\nSo u g o, u for user, g for\ngroup, o for other, all right.\n\n489\n00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,400\nSo we start by saying that.\n\n490\n00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,210\nThen we use a plus or\n\n491\n00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:47,660\na minus sign to show whether we're adding\npermissions or removing permissions.\n\n492\n00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:52,590\nAnd then we do an r, a w, or an x to\nindicate whether it's gonna be read,\n\n493\n00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:57,880\nwrite, or execute or\nany combination of the batch, right.\n\n494\n00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,490\nSo for example,\nif I look at my Test2 file,\n\n495\n00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,830\nI can see where everyone has read access.\n\n496\n00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,900\nMaybe I don't want everyone\nto have read access.\n\n497\n00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:15,300\nIf I wanna take that away well,\nI can say chmod g-r.\n\n498\n00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,450\nAnd then I can specify the file name,\nright.\n\n499\n00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,750\nG means I'm modifying\nthe group permissions.\n\n500\n00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,490\nMinus means I'm taking away permissions,\nand\n\n501\n00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,120\nr means I'm taking away\nthe read permissions.\n\n502\n00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,710\nAnd then the file that I'm modifying,\nTest2.rtf, all right.\n\n503\n00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:39,440\nAnd when I run that,\nI get invalid file mode.\n\n504\n00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,788\nWell isn't that exciting.\n\n505\n00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:45,960\nOh, I've written chmod twice so\nlet me just fix that, there we go.\n\n506\n00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,520\nAnd now we can get it working properly.\n\n507\n00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,480\nProper syntax,\nthere's no substitute for that.\n\n508\n00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,630\nWell, how do I know that it worked?\n\n509\n00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,340\nWell I can pull up my\ndirectory listing again and\n\n510\n00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,880\nif I look at Test2, I can see where I did,\noh shoot, I did the group.\n\n511\n00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,300\n[LAUGH] I messed that one entirely up.\n\n512\n00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,286\nSo I removed the group's permission,\n\n513\n00:28:04,286 --> 00:28:07,250\nright, see how the group\njust lost read access.\n\n514\n00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,965\nI meant to do other which was o,\nI should have done an o there.\n\n515\n00:28:10,965 --> 00:28:13,921\nSo if I rerun that command, and I do o-r,\n\n516\n00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:18,925\nnow I removed everyone's read permission,\nright?\n\n517\n00:28:18,925 --> 00:28:22,345\nAnd when I take a look at that,\nI can see where they don't have it.\n\n518\n00:28:22,345 --> 00:28:23,845\nBut I kind of screwed things up, right,\n\n519\n00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:28,290\nI accidentally took away read\npermission from the group, from staff.\n\n520\n00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,080\nAnd maybe I didn't want that,\nI need to put them back.\n\n521\n00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,830\nWell fortunately that's pretty easy.\n\n522\n00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,830\nWe can just say chmod g.\n\n523\n00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:41,880\nI'm gonna modify the group and I'll use\na plus sign, so I'm adding permissions.\n\n524\n00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,700\nI'm gonna add the read permission\nback to Test2.rtf, right.\n\n525\n00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,580\nSo now I'm adding those\npermissions back to the group, and\n\n526\n00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,100\nif I pull up the list again,\nI'll see the group now has read-access,\n\n527\n00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,710\njust like they did before, at backend,\neasy enough to fix, right.\n\n528\n00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,750\nSo remember the structure of that command.\n\n529\n00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,580\nThe first part is who you're modifying,\nu, g, o.\n\n530\n00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,280\nThe second part is what you're doing,\nplus or minus, adding or taking away.\n\n531\n00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,930\nAnd the last part is the permission\nyou're assigning, read, write or execute.\n\n532\n00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:18,320\nAnd you can actually combine these\ntogether to create super commands.\n\n533\n00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,520\nIn the show notes that I'm gonna post for\nthis episode,\n\n534\n00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,040\nyou'll see several different examples\nof how you can present the command.\n\n535\n00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,600\nBut let's say for example that I wanted to\ngive everybody read access to this file or\n\n536\n00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,610\nread and write.\n\n537\n00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,140\nI wanted everybody to have both read and\nwrite.\n\n538\n00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,500\nI want the user to have read and write.\n\n539\n00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,130\nI want the group to have read and write.\n\n540\n00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:40,280\nAnd I want everyone, the other,\nto have read and write, all right.\n\n541\n00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,631\nI can combine that I can say, chmod ugo,\n\n542\n00:29:45,631 --> 00:29:53,380\nright, so that's all three user group and\nother, +rw.\n\n543\n00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,730\nI'm adding read and\nwrite at the same time to u, g and o.\n\n544\n00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,510\nAnd, it's gonna get mad at me,\nwhat did I do?\n\n545\n00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,490\nOh, I guess I forgot to mention\nthe file that I was modifying.\n\n546\n00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,548\nThere we go, so\nI got a little ahead of myself here.\n\n547\n00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:11,350\nSo chmod ugo+rw, so\nI'm adding read and write to the user,\n\n548\n00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:15,390\nthe group, and other for Test2.rtf.\n\n549\n00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:21,250\nAnd if I pull up my listing now, I can\nsee where everybody got read and write.\n\n550\n00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,630\nAnd I can do the same\nthing with taking away.\n\n551\n00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:31,090\nIf I want to remove The write\npermissions for the group and\n\n552\n00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,110\nfor other, I can say,\ngo-w Test2.rtf, right.\n\n553\n00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,850\nAnd that's gonna take\nthose permissions away.\n\n554\n00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:43,990\nAnd I'll take a look at that, and now I\nstill have read and write as the user, but\n\n555\n00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:48,610\nthe group and the other,\neveryone, they don't.\n\n556\n00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,900\nSo easy ways to get in there and\nmodify that.\n\n557\n00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,290\nNow, each time that I've done this, I've\ndone it on a single file, on one file.\n\n558\n00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,240\nBut you can do it on a folder too.\n\n559\n00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,900\nIf you modify a file folders\npermissions it's the same, right?\n\n560\n00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,902\nLet's say that I have a folder called,\n\n561\n00:31:04,902 --> 00:31:08,310\nwell I guess I have my tax returns folder,\nright.\n\n562\n00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:11,680\nSo if I look at my tax returns folder,\nsee how I've got read, write and\n\n563\n00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,960\nexecute on that folder?\n\n564\n00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,740\nSo I've got tons of permissions on that\nfolder and nobody else has access.\n\n565\n00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,150\nRemember we took it away,\nthat's why wheel is the group, right.\n\n566\n00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,820\nWell, if I have another folder like that\nand I start to modify its permissions,\n\n567\n00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,660\nthere's something important that\nwe need to pay attention to,\n\n568\n00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,480\nsomething that happened automatically\nin the GUI that didn't happen here.\n\n569\n00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,780\nI'm gonna make another directory\nwhich I'll call, Secrets.\n\n570\n00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,050\nAll right, this is where I'm\ngoing to store all of my secrets.\n\n571\n00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,632\nAnd I'll have some files in here.\n\n572\n00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:43,878\nLet me just create some quick files.\n\n573\n00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,341\nAll right, so here's my Secrets folder.\n\n574\n00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:54,443\nAnd you can see the default permissions,\nright?\n\n575\n00:31:54,443 --> 00:31:57,520\nThe user has read, write and execute.\n\n576\n00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,910\nThe group has read and execute.\n\n577\n00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:03,480\nAnd the other, everyone,\nhas read and execute.\n\n578\n00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,120\nI'm the default user,\nDon Pezet staff is the default group.\n\n579\n00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,730\nSo that's all the defaults on that folder.\n\n580\n00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,940\nAnd if I change into that folder,\nactually i'm already in there aren't I?\n\n581\n00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,370\nLet's see what folder I'm in?\n\n582\n00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:14,870\nYup.\n\n583\n00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:20,130\nAll right, if I look at those\nthe individual files they have read and\n\n584\n00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:24,340\nwrite for the user, read for\nthe group, and read for other.\n\n585\n00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,190\nThose are the default\npermissions that it pulled.\n\n586\n00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,790\nJames in the chat room\nmentioned chmod 664.\n\n587\n00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:36,530\nThe old way of doing this, right of\nassigning permissions, is that you had to\n\n588\n00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:41,470\ndo a numerical presentation like each of\nthe really was represented by a bit value.\n\n589\n00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:46,780\nAnd so you had the value of seven\nrepresented read, write and\n\n590\n00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,780\nexecute versus the value of five\nwhich was just read and execute.\n\n591\n00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,540\nAnd so if we had something like this\nguy up here where it was read and\n\n592\n00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,570\nexecute, this guy that permission\ncan actually be written as 755.\n\n593\n00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,900\nAnd so, you used to have to do this\ncalculation, like figure out, all right,\n\n594\n00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,420\nwhat are the numbers that represent this?\n\n595\n00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,980\nAnd that was a harder way of doing things.\n\n596\n00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,520\nIt does still work though.\n\n597\n00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,720\nSo, for example, if i make a file4.txt,\n\n598\n00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,982\nI can do a chmod 755 file4.txt,\n\n599\n00:33:17,982 --> 00:33:22,320\nlike that, and\nit's still handles that just fine.\n\n600\n00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,780\nIf I look at file four,\nsee how it got read, write execute.\n\n601\n00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,700\nRead and execute.\n\n602\n00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,760\nRead and execute.\n\n603\n00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,900\nThose commands are there.\n\n604\n00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,200\nOr the one James mentioned, was 664.\n\n605\n00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,400\nThat was another popular one.\n\n606\n00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,710\nIf I go and change it, and\n\n607\n00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,750\nthen take a look at it, you'll see [COUGH]\nwhere file four now has read and write for\n\n608\n00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,830\nme and read and write for the group and\njust read for everyone else right?\n\n609\n00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,770\nThe numerical representations.\n\n610\n00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:50,330\nIt's a lot easier to represent that\nthose be plus and minus r, w or\n\n611\n00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,030\nx then trying to figure\nout what the numbers are.\n\n612\n00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,608\nBut both still work.\nYeah.\n\n613\n00:33:53,608 --> 00:33:55,114\nAll right.\n\n614\n00:33:55,114 --> 00:34:00,570\n[COUGH] So far, these are all just\ndefault permission, all right?\n\n615\n00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,030\nWatch what happens when\nI change the permissions\n\n616\n00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,870\nof the folder itself, all right?\n\n617\n00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,110\nSo here's that secrets folder, and\n\n618\n00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:12,250\nI'm gonna take away the read\npermission for the everyone group.\n\n619\n00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,720\nWell I guess I'll take away [INAUDIBLE].\n\n620\n00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,460\nSo I'm gonna get rid of those permissions.\n\n621\n00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,070\nFor the everyone group.\n\n622\n00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:22,240\nSo I'm gonna do chmod o,\nfor other, that's everyone.\n\n623\n00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,230\nI'm gonna remove read and\nexecute from the secrets folder.\n\n624\n00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,420\nAnd if I pull up my listing,\nI can see on secrets that worked.\n\n625\n00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:40,750\nRead and execute are gone from that folder\nnow if I change into that folder, and I\n\n626\n00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:47,880\nlook at the files inside of it, notice how\nthose permissions did not trickle down.\n\n627\n00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,120\nThe permissions didn't trickle down\nto the files that are inside of it.\n\n628\n00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,400\nWell [COUGH], that's because I'm\ndoing it from the command line.\n\n629\n00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,550\nIn the graphical user interface,\nby default,\n\n630\n00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,880\nthe files would have learned their\npermissions from the parent folder.\n\n631\n00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,170\nIt's where they get\ntheir permissions from.\n\n632\n00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,580\nAnd so, when you pull up a file or\nfolder of those default permissions,\n\n633\n00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,970\nthey're actually coming from whatever\nobject is up above them, right?\n\n634\n00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,130\nSo, this file here,\n\n635\n00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:16,540\nthis test file that I made,\nif it's inside of a folder called test,\n\n636\n00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,900\nwhatever permissions were on the folder\ntrickle down to this file by default.\n\n637\n00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,280\nAnd you can go in and\nmodify them til your heart's content.\n\n638\n00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,300\nBut where the permissions came from.\n\n639\n00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,820\nWhen we modify\nthe permissions of a folder,\n\n640\n00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,060\nif we want it to take effect to\neverything underneath it also,\n\n641\n00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,690\nwe need to add a little bit\nmore to that command we ran.\n\n642\n00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:41,250\nSo what I ran was this, chmod o-rx, right?\n\n643\n00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:45,100\nRemove, read and\nexecute from the everyone group, right?\n\n644\n00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,200\nAnd then I applied that\nto the Secrets folder.\n\n645\n00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,910\nWell, I going to add a little\nbit more right after to chmod,\n\n646\n00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:53,250\nI'm going to add a -R.\n\n647\n00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,910\nAnd that means do this recursively.\n\n648\n00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:01,510\nDon't just do the folder, but\ndo all the objects inside of that folder.\n\n649\n00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,240\nAnd it's gonna go and do that.\n\n650\n00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,100\nAnd now when I look at the folder.\n\n651\n00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,940\nYes the folder secrets.\n\n652\n00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,060\nEveryone has nothing, right?\n\n653\n00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,930\nThat happened.\n\n654\n00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:10,490\nThat worked fine.\n\n655\n00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:14,050\nAnd if I change into that folder and\n\n656\n00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:18,890\nI look, I can see that it applied\nto all the objects underneath it.\n\n657\n00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,340\nThat's recursively setting\nthose permissions.\n\n658\n00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,920\nA little dash r is a pretty handy one.\n\n659\n00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,060\nUsually when you're changing\nthe permissions of a folder,\n\n660\n00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,640\nyou want that change to apply to\nthe object underneath it, too.\n\n661\n00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,550\nSo that's kind of a given.\n\n662\n00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,710\nAll right.\n\n663\n00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:36,380\nIf I go back to my GUI, let me get\nrid of some of these windows here.\n\n664\n00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,310\nAnd I take one of my folders\nlike that Secrets folder.\n\n665\n00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:44,440\nAnd I go, and I take a look here and\nlook at the Access.\n\n666\n00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,140\nWhen I go and modify that access,\n\n667\n00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,600\nlike here I'm gonna give read-only\naccess back to the everyone group.\n\n668\n00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,180\nRight.\n\n669\n00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,180\nSo I just applied that to that group.\n\n670\n00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,530\nIt's applied there.\n\n671\n00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:58,760\nAnd if I get out of that and\ngo into my secrets folder.\n\n672\n00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,390\nHere's all these individual files and\nI'll pull up one of those.\n\n673\n00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,360\nSee how it didn't make it recursive.\n\n674\n00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,900\nIt didn't flow through to\nthe ones underneath it.\n\n675\n00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,120\nSo just be aware of that,\nthat permission don't always inherit down.\n\n676\n00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,570\nIf you're trying to change permissions for\n\n677\n00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,500\na large quantity of folders, go into the\ncommand line and using that dash R can be\n\n678\n00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,450\nmuch more convenient than trying\nto do it here through the UI.\n\n679\n00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,600\nAll right, another thing worth\n\n680\n00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,790\nmentioning is if you start messing\naround with these permissions, right?\n\n681\n00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,080\nAnd you don't like what you've done but\n\n682\n00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,110\nyou haven't closed out yet,\nyou can still revert them.\n\n683\n00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,690\nWhen you hit this little gear box\nyou'll see a revert changes option.\n\n684\n00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,140\nSo, if you start to make some changes like\nthere, assigning read only to that one.\n\n685\n00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,320\nSee how my revert changes button lit up?\n\n686\n00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,120\nAnd I can revert that, and it will\nput it back to the way that it was.\n\n687\n00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,780\nYou have a brief period of\ntime to undo your changes,\n\n688\n00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,440\nif you're uncertain about\nwhat you're trying, or\n\n689\n00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,960\nwhatever it'll let you move it back,\nso, kind of neat stuff there.\n\n690\n00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:56,759\nAnother thing worth mentioning,\nthat is probably not on the exam, but\n\n691\n00:37:56,759 --> 00:38:00,243\nin real life land,\nIf you recover a file from time machine,\n\n692\n00:38:00,243 --> 00:38:04,370\nif you've modified the permissions\nsince your time machine backup.\n\n693\n00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:07,010\nWhen you restore from time machine it will\nput the permissions back to the way they\n\n694\n00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,820\nwere when the backup was taken.\n\n695\n00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,170\nSo time machine not only backs up files,\nbut\n\n696\n00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:14,000\nit preserves the permissions assigned to\nthose files too which is pretty cool.\n\n697\n00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,050\nAll right.\nSo like I said, in the show notes for\n\n698\n00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,550\nthis one, I've got a few more\nexamples of that change mod command.\n\n699\n00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,210\nFeel free to peruse through those.\n\n700\n00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,390\nBut I think you guys get\nthe basic gist of it here.\n\n701\n00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:29,150\nIt's not very hard.\n\n702\n00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,590\nPretty plain English nowadays,\n\n703\n00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,370\nas opposed to the old days where you\nhad to do the numerical calculations.\n\n704\n00:38:34,922 --> 00:38:37,560\nAll right, let's see,\nwhat else do we have on permissions?\n\n705\n00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,190\nLet's see, we talked about inheritance,\nwe talked about a few other things.\n\n706\n00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,830\nI mentioned a little bit about\nthe read and write permissions and\n\n707\n00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,720\nhow they work, right?\n\n708\n00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,030\nRead permissions let you open and\nlook at the contents of a file.\n\n709\n00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,580\nRead permissions on a folder,\n\n710\n00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,480\non the other hand, lets you open\nthe folder and list the contents, right?\n\n711\n00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,440\nThe files that are inside of it.\n\n712\n00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,900\nWrite permissions on a file lets you\nmodify what's in the file and save it.\n\n713\n00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,810\nWrite permissions on a folder lets\nyou create new objects in the folder.\n\n714\n00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,750\nYou can create new files or\nnew subfolders.\n\n715\n00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,290\nSo a little bit of a variation there,\nbut either way you're writing data.\n\n716\n00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,210\nAll right.\n\n717\n00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:16,300\nThere was execute that I mentioned which\nwill let you actually run a program.\n\n718\n00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,750\nThere's no access.\n\n719\n00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,950\nNo access means, well,\nwhat it's name implies.\n\n720\n00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,470\nYou have no access to that file or folder.\n\n721\n00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,520\nNo access on a file means\nyou cannot even open it.\n\n722\n00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,410\nNo access on a folder means\nyou can't open it and\n\n723\n00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,690\nlist the contents that are inside of it.\n\n724\n00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:30,640\nAll right.\n\n725\n00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,980\nNow [COUGH] those permissions\nare kind of set by default, and\n\n726\n00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,400\nthey're applied to our systems and,\nyou know actually hang on.\n\n727\n00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,300\nI'm leaving one out.\n\n728\n00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,420\nLet me tackle this other one.\n\n729\n00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,791\nI'm gonna go a little\nbit out of order here.\n\n730\n00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:46,369\nThere's one other permission\nthat I haven't talked about,\n\n731\n00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:48,512\nand that's the write only Dropbox.\n\n732\n00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:49,384\nOkay.\n\n733\n00:39:49,384 --> 00:39:51,567\nLet me show you that on my folder here.\n\n734\n00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:53,202\nSo I've got this Secrets folder, right.\n\n735\n00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:55,470\nThis is where I wanna store my secrets.\n\n736\n00:39:55,470 --> 00:40:00,530\nAnd maybe I want to allow to people\nto give me their secrets, right.\n\n737\n00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:03,050\nTo copy their secret\ninformation to my folder, but\n\n738\n00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,000\nI wanna be really careful about this.\n\n739\n00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,960\nI don't want other people to be able\nto read the secrets from other people.\n\n740\n00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,420\nSo for example, let's say that\nJohn Doe gives me a secret, and\n\n741\n00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,430\nI copy it into this folder.\n\n742\n00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,440\nI don't want Jane Doe to\nbe able to come along and\n\n743\n00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,350\nread the secret that\nJohn Doe put in there.\n\n744\n00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,220\nI want some separation right.\n\n745\n00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:30,020\nWhat I can do is, I can give a permission\nout, which is called write only.\n\n746\n00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,820\nIf I pull up the settings for\nthat folder and\n\n747\n00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,220\nI go to everyone, see how\neveryone's got read only right now?\n\n748\n00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,170\nIf I drop that down,\nhere's this Write only Drop Box.\n\n749\n00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,180\nNow what does that mean?\n\n750\n00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,260\nWell, drop box is not a reference\nto the file sharing service on\n\n751\n00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,280\nthe internet right.\n\n752\n00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,010\nIt's a reference to what banks used\nto have, or banks probably still do.\n\n753\n00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:53,410\nUsed to be that if you wanted to\nmake a deposit at your bank, well,\n\n754\n00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,390\nif the bank was open, you could walk\nright inside and make a deposit.\n\n755\n00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,660\nBut if the bank was closed, banks almost\nalways had a dropbox on the outside, or\n\n756\n00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,410\nthey might have called\nit a night deposit box.\n\n757\n00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,880\nAt the post office,\nthey still call it a dropbox.\n\n758\n00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,830\nYou drive up, you open the dropbox,\n\n759\n00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,320\nyou stick your package in there,\nyou close the dropbox.\n\n760\n00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,790\nIf you open it again, what do you see?\n\n761\n00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,800\nNothing, right, it's gone.\n\n762\n00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,380\nIt's fallen into the back end\nsomewhere where the post office or\n\n763\n00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,560\nthe bank can get at it.\n\n764\n00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,280\nBut you can't get back at it again,\nall right.\n\n765\n00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,440\nAnd the next person in line when\nthey walk in, they'll open it up and\n\n766\n00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,400\nthey see nothing.\n\n767\n00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,770\nThey stick their package in and\nclose it, and when they open it again,\n\n768\n00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,770\nthey see nothing.\n\n769\n00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,790\nThey don't see my package, they don't\nsee their own package, it's all gone.\n\n770\n00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,370\nIt always looks empty.\n\n771\n00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:40,630\nA folder with write-only permissions\non it will always look empty to you.\n\n772\n00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:45,010\nAnd you can copy stuff to it, but\nyou won't be able to see it, and\n\n773\n00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,040\nyou won't be able to\nretrieve that data again.\n\n774\n00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,270\nIt's a one way folder, and\nthat's why Apple calls it a drop box.\n\n775\n00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:54,470\nAnd the idea is you might wanna\nmake it where other users can\n\n776\n00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,880\neasily share data with you, right?\n\n777\n00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,400\nSo Jane Doe's been working on a document,\nshe wants me to have a look at it, but\n\n778\n00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,630\nshe doesn't wanna give me\npermissions to her home folder.\n\n779\n00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:08,970\nSo instead she can browse to my home\nfolder, go into my drop box and\n\n780\n00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:13,030\nstick the data there and\nthen I'll have access to it.\n\n781\n00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,700\nShe won't have access to it cuz it's\nbeen copied to my profile it's safe and\n\n782\n00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,590\nsecure, but I'll have access to it, right.\n\n783\n00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,390\nAnd that's what the write\nonly permission is for.\n\n784\n00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,410\nSo when I pull up the Secrets folder if\nI change this so that everyone has write\n\n785\n00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,890\nonly drop box permissions on it,\nit'll be present, now people can copy\n\n786\n00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:34,170\nstuff into this secrets folder and\nonly I will be able to retrieve it.\n\n787\n00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,340\nOr the group if I chose to\ngive that access out to.\n\n788\n00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:42,950\nThe key thing to remember about write\nonly, it only applies to folders.\n\n789\n00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:46,900\nIf I go and find a file, like my\nTest2 file, and I pull up it's info.\n\n790\n00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,670\nAnd I go to every one and\n\n791\n00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:52,340\nI drop that down,\nwrite only is not even an option, right.\n\n792\n00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:57,270\nBecause, what would happen is, if it\napplied to a file, you'd open the file and\n\n793\n00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,600\nit would look empty.\n\n794\n00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,270\nAnd you put data in there and you lose\neverything else that was in the file\n\n795\n00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,210\nbefore because it looked empty to you.\n\n796\n00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,180\nThat's not good right, we don't want that.\n\n797\n00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,230\nSo it doesn't apply to files,\nit only applies to folders.\n\n798\n00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:11,000\nBut it's a great way to do\none way file transfers.\n\n799\n00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,899\nPeople can give you stuff but\nthey can't get stuff back, right,\n\n800\n00:43:13,899 --> 00:43:15,120\nit's a one-way deposit.\n\n801\n00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,460\nAnd that's why they call it a drop box.\n\n802\n00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,600\nNow there is actually a drop box\ncreated by default for every user.\n\n803\n00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,970\nWhen your user profile is created, there's\na number of folders that are made for you.\n\n804\n00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,200\nAnd we see some of them, right?\n\n805\n00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,840\nWe've got, like, Desktop and\nDocuments and downloads.\n\n806\n00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,610\nThese are folders that are created\ninside of your profile.\n\n807\n00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:39,960\nThere's another folder,\nthat's called Public, all right.\n\n808\n00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,160\nAnd I don't see it here, but\nif I go straight to the folder.\n\n809\n00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,790\nLet me just go into my folder,\ninto Public.\n\n810\n00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,630\nI can browse into that folder and\nsee how I've got a folder call Drop Box?\n\n811\n00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,250\nSo in your user profile,\nthere's a folder called Public, and\n\n812\n00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,870\ninside of Public,\nthere's a folder called Drop Box.\n\n813\n00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:05,020\nAnd Drop Box,\nif I look at its permissions,\n\n814\n00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:10,130\nhas everyone in the group set as\nwrite only drop box by default.\n\n815\n00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:14,090\nI didn't set that, right, it's set\nby the operating system by default.\n\n816\n00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,100\nSo every user already has\none drop box created.\n\n817\n00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,130\nYou can create others if you want, but\n\n818\n00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,442\nyou've already got one sitting there,\nready for you.\n\n819\n00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,720\nThat public folder,\n\n820\n00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,540\nApple creates that because it's\ndesigned stuff you wanna share.\n\n821\n00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,380\nIf you wanna make files available to\neverybody else on the computer, you just\n\n822\n00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,580\nstick it in the public folder, and\nthey can browse to it and see it, right?\n\n823\n00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:37,510\nBut if you only want the files\nto be available to you,\n\n824\n00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,090\nthen you can make a drop box folder.\n\n825\n00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,610\nPeople can drop the stuff in the drop\nbox folder, you'll have access and\n\n826\n00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,820\nthat's it, right.\n\n827\n00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:47,030\nSo those are created automatically\nbased on the system.\n\n828\n00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:49,780\nNow that's an important thing to\nunderstand is that there's a lot of stuff\n\n829\n00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,270\nalready done for you in Mac OS.\n\n830\n00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,620\nRemember Apple's moniker of,\n\n831\n00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:57,620\nit just works, you shouldn't have to mess\nwith a lot of this underlying stuff.\n\n832\n00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,800\nThey've already set default permissions\nthat are more than adequate for us.\n\n833\n00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,330\nFor the exam, you need to be familiar\nwith those default permissions.\n\n834\n00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:08,510\nSo what I wanna do is walk you\nthrough a default user profile.\n\n835\n00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:11,680\nTheir home directory,\nwhat it looked like for a normal user, and\n\n836\n00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,500\nwhat experience they're gonna have.\n\n837\n00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,220\nSo we'll take a look at those but\nfor right now, let's stop here and\n\n838\n00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,811\ntake a break.\n\n839\n00:45:16,811 --> 00:45:20,971\nAnd when we get back, we'll go on a tour\nof file permissions in a user profile.\n\n840\n00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:23,260\nStay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n841\n00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:30,591\n[MUSIC]\n\n842\n00:45:30,591 --> 00:45:32,540\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n843\n00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,780\nSo during the break, we actually had some\nreally good questions in the chat room,\n\n844\n00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,370\nand I wanna thank everybody in the chat\nroom for throwing this stuff out there.\n\n845\n00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:43,300\nThere were some questions about going\nbeyond the normal permissions that we see.\n\n846\n00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,370\nAll the permissions we\nassigned in the last segment,\n\n847\n00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,940\nthose were standard POSIX permissions.\n\n848\n00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,560\nThere was a user that acted as the owner,\nthere was a group,\n\n849\n00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,370\nand then there was everyone, all right.\n\n850\n00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:57,190\nBut, what if you wanna go beyond that,\nwhat if you wanna have\n\n851\n00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:01,580\npermissions that are more customized than\nwhat the basic POSIX permissions allow?\n\n852\n00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,490\nWell, Apple's thought of that and\nthey've got support for it.\n\n853\n00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:08,020\nThat system list was called\na Access Control List or an ACL.\n\n854\n00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:12,500\nAnd ACLs go beyond the basic Unix\npermission structure that we\n\n855\n00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,590\njust saw in the last segment, all right.\n\n856\n00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:17,920\nSo, normally when we go in and\nstart to deal with permissions, like here,\n\n857\n00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,830\nI'll just take this file1.txt and\npull up it's data.\n\n858\n00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:26,990\nWe see the owner, the group, and\nthe other, right, everyone else.\n\n859\n00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,120\nBut I can add to that.\n\n860\n00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,220\nFor example, here I can add,\nand I can give Jane Doe access.\n\n861\n00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:37,220\nI'm gonna give Jane Doe read only,\nwe'll give her read/write.\n\n862\n00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,950\nSo Jane Doe gets read/write.\n\n863\n00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:43,100\nThen I can add in John Doe, all right.\n\n864\n00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,110\nAnd so I'll add him and\nnow John Doe he's got read only.\n\n865\n00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:50,872\nSo now my list is much bigger than\nstandard POSIX permissions would allow,\n\n866\n00:46:50,872 --> 00:46:51,880\nright.\n\n867\n00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,640\nWe saw in the command line\nthere were only three sections.\n\n868\n00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,475\nThe owner, the group and other, right?\n\n869\n00:46:57,475 --> 00:47:00,310\nRead/write execute, read/write execute,\nread/write execute,\n\n870\n00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,310\nthey're just nine blanks and that was it.\n\n871\n00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:07,110\nSo, where do these other guys go\nif it's storing these permissions?\n\n872\n00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:11,040\nWell, Apple has an extended\npermissions set.\n\n873\n00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,720\nAnd the extended permissions set is\nwhat's called an access control list.\n\n874\n00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,690\nThe list of additional users and\ngroups that have access,\n\n875\n00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:19,190\nbecause it doesn't just have to be users.\n\n876\n00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:23,810\nFor example, I created a group earlier,\nI thought I created a group earlier.\n\n877\n00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:26,150\nI guess I didn't,\nI could've swore I created a group.\n\n878\n00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:28,210\nAnyhow, if I had created a group\nit would show up in here.\n\n879\n00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:29,990\nI guess I have administrators, right.\n\n880\n00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,400\nSo I could add administrators in,\nand there's that admin group, and\n\n881\n00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,620\nI can give them access too, right.\n\n882\n00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,287\nSo this is a lot more than\nwhat the regular permissions\n\n883\n00:47:38,287 --> 00:47:39,542\nare designed to handle.\n\n884\n00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:44,645\nWhat I've just done in a couple of clicks\nis to create an access control list,\n\n885\n00:47:44,645 --> 00:47:47,878\nand via the GUI,\nit's really, really simple.\n\n886\n00:47:47,878 --> 00:47:49,875\nThat wasn't very hard at all, was it?\n\n887\n00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:52,463\nOn the command line,\nit's a little more involved.\n\n888\n00:47:52,463 --> 00:47:53,763\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n889\n00:47:53,763 --> 00:47:58,270\nI just did that all on file1.txt.\n\n890\n00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:03,270\nIf I get into my documents folder and\nthat was inside of Secrets.\n\n891\n00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:06,520\nSo I'll get into my secrets folder,\nthere we go.\n\n892\n00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,570\nI can see file1.txt right there.\n\n893\n00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:14,120\nAnd if I do an ls-l,\nlike I've been doing the whole show,\n\n894\n00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:20,060\nthere's file one and I can see\nthat the owner has read and write.\n\n895\n00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,450\nThe group has read and\neveryone else has nothing.\n\n896\n00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,780\nAnd if I go back here to my access list\nto verify that I can see the owner\n\n897\n00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:30,110\nhas read and write, the group has read and\neverybody else has nothing.\n\n898\n00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,740\nThat's what I expect to see.\n\n899\n00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,980\nBut where's admin, John Doe and Jane Doe?\n\n900\n00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,230\nThey're not in that list.\n\n901\n00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:36,880\nAll right.\n\n902\n00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,090\nWell notice that little +sign at\nthe end of the permissions there.\n\n903\n00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,650\nThat plus sign is a warning to us.\n\n904\n00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:46,700\nIt's letting us know that there's\nan ACL attached to this file.\n\n905\n00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:51,170\nAn extended set of permissions that\ngo beyond what POSIX supports.\n\n906\n00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:55,470\nThat's what that little plus means,\ndon't confuse that with a T.\n\n907\n00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:58,720\nThere's another one that\nputs a T in the last blank.\n\n908\n00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,430\nWe'll talk about that\nat the end of the show.\n\n909\n00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:04,290\nBut this one's a plus sign, it goes beyond\nthe edge of the other ones, all right.\n\n910\n00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:06,260\nIt's like an 11th placeholder.\n\n911\n00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:10,990\nSo that plus is telling me there's more\npermissions, but I don't see them.\n\n912\n00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:18,010\nWell, instead of running ls -l, if you\nadd an e to that, so I'm gonna say ls-e.\n\n913\n00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:21,560\nThat's gonna let me see those extended\npermissions gonna let me see the ACL\n\n914\n00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,090\nthe Access Control List.\n\n915\n00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:27,800\nSo I'm going to run that and\nthe screen that outputs, there we go,\n\n916\n00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,750\nis usually going to wrap\naround a little bit.\n\n917\n00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:33,910\nBut I can see there's a lot more\nin here than what I saw before.\n\n918\n00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:39,880\nHere is file 1.text and I see my normal\nunit space permissions right there for\n\n919\n00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,150\nthe owner, the group and everyone.\n\n920\n00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,830\nBut right after that I see 0, 1, and 2.\n\n921\n00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:49,570\nThese are my access control list entries,\nright.\n\n922\n00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,900\nEach additional line that I added.\n\n923\n00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,190\nI added admin, johndoe, and janedoe.\n\n924\n00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:57,840\nThey're right there in the list,\nthose are ones that I added.\n\n925\n00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:02,516\nAnd you'll see, there's the group admin,\nthere's the user, johndoe, the user,\n\n926\n00:50:02,516 --> 00:50:03,740\njanedoe.\n\n927\n00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,600\nAnd you'll see where I've allowed\nthem certain types of access.\n\n928\n00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:13,330\nAnd then it proceeds to list,\nthe types of access, read, write, append.\n\n929\n00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:16,740\nreadattr, writeattr,\nreadextattr, and so on.\n\n930\n00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:21,260\nAll the different permissions that go\nalong with that read and write access.\n\n931\n00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,800\nThis is what is called\nan access control list.\n\n932\n00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,910\nAnd it lets us get super specific about\nthe permissions that we hand out.\n\n933\n00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:32,950\nThe default permissions, we have that drop\ndown box you just choose from read only,\n\n934\n00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,410\nread and write, or no access.\n\n935\n00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:36,270\nThat's really it, right,\njust three options.\n\n936\n00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,120\nBut there's a lot more to it.\n\n937\n00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,290\nRead and write entails considerably more.\n\n938\n00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,740\nIn fact, just look at read only.\n\n939\n00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,460\nJohn Doe had read only.\n\n940\n00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,490\nSo he got read permissions.\n\n941\n00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:47,150\nBut he also had to get read attribute,\nread extended attribute, and\n\n942\n00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,370\nread security.\n\n943\n00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:51,250\nHe's gotta be able to read the security\nof the file to make sure that he\n\n944\n00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,610\nhas the access to be able to open it and\nlook at the contents.\n\n945\n00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:57,970\nSo there's more than just\nthe base permission involved.\n\n946\n00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:01,480\nAccess control lists are very powerful\nbecause they let you pick and\n\n947\n00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,640\nchoose the individual components\ninside of that, all right?\n\n948\n00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,200\nNow these can be modified\nfrom the command line, but\n\n949\n00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,400\nthe commands are a little bit\ndifferent from what we've seen.\n\n950\n00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,500\nSo, for example, janedoe right?\n\n951\n00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,875\nLet's say that I take,\nwell we'll do file2.\n\n952\n00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:20,240\nFile2 does not currently have\nan access control list right?\n\n953\n00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,660\nI don't see a plus sign right here and\nso there's nothing there.\n\n954\n00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,160\nAll right.\n\n955\n00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,575\nIf I want to add add additional\npermissions to that.\n\n956\n00:51:27,575 --> 00:51:31,715\nMaybe I want to give Jane Doe read and\nwrite permissions on this one, and\n\n957\n00:51:31,715 --> 00:51:34,655\nI want to give John Doe just\nread permissions to it.\n\n958\n00:51:34,655 --> 00:51:39,193\nWell, I'm gonna jump back\ninto my chmod command.\n\n959\n00:51:39,193 --> 00:51:44,085\nWe used chmod earlier in this show\nbecause we were adding read or write for\n\n960\n00:51:44,085 --> 00:51:45,935\nthe regular UNIX groups.\n\n961\n00:51:45,935 --> 00:51:48,415\nNow, I'm going beyond that and\nto go beyond that,\n\n962\n00:51:48,415 --> 00:51:53,585\nwhat you have to do Is you have\nto say chmod +a or minus a.\n\n963\n00:51:53,585 --> 00:51:58,410\n+a, means you're adding to\nthe access control list.\n\n964\n00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:02,340\nMinus A, means you're taking away\nfrom the access control list.\n\n965\n00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,380\nRight.\nIf I wanted to, for\n\n966\n00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,280\nexample, remove all of Jane's permissions.\n\n967\n00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,630\nFrom up here I would use minus A,\nfollowed by what I wanted to remove,\n\n968\n00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:14,110\nwell I want to add permissions\nto file two, all right?\n\n969\n00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,850\nSo I'm going to say chmod +a.\n\n970\n00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:18,840\nNow the syntax from here\nstarts to get really specific.\n\n971\n00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,730\nIt's a big string block.\n\n972\n00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:23,075\nIt's basically everything after A colon.\n\n973\n00:52:23,075 --> 00:52:25,610\nThe name what you're doing and\n\n974\n00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:28,130\nthen all the permissions you\nassign separated by commas.\n\n975\n00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:30,270\nThat's what's gonna follow\nright here after the A.\n\n976\n00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:32,090\nI'm gonna go real simple.\n\n977\n00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:37,750\nAnd I'm just gonna say johndoe allow read.\n\n978\n00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:38,450\nOkay?\n\n979\n00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,280\nNow if I stop right there It's gonna,\noops.\n\n980\n00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,070\nIf I stop write there\nI'm gonna get an error.\n\n981\n00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,790\nI didn't tell it what file to modify,\nright?\n\n982\n00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:48,244\nSo I want it to modify file2.txt.\n\n983\n00:52:48,244 --> 00:52:49,810\nThere we go.\n\n984\n00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:55,020\nI just gave John Doe read access\nto that particular file and\n\n985\n00:52:55,020 --> 00:53:00,190\nif I want to give Jane Doe read and\nwrite I would just come in here and\n\n986\n00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:04,077\nsay janedoe allow read,\n\n987\n00:53:04,077 --> 00:53:09,080\nwrite for file two, all right.\n\n988\n00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:16,310\nNow when I do an ls-l,\nI'll see a plus sign for file two.\n\n989\n00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:17,250\nIt's got an ACL.\n\n990\n00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:23,470\nAnd if I do an ls-le,\nI'll actually see that ACL.\n\n991\n00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:27,800\nAnd there's janedoe with read and\nwrite, and johndoe with read.\n\n992\n00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,540\nRight.\n\n993\n00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,760\nBut I am gonna have a little problem here.\n\n994\n00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:35,300\nYes, I gave them read and write, or read\nin the case of John Doe, but, because I\n\n995\n00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,760\ndidn't give the other permissions that go\nalong with it, it's not gonna work right.\n\n996\n00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,920\nAnd you can see that.\n\n997\n00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,910\nIf I go into the GUI, if I browse through\nfile two and I pull up it's info,\n\n998\n00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:49,680\nso I'll just take file two's info,\nnotice that John Doe and\n\n999\n00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,420\nJane Doe have custom permissions.\n\n1000\n00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,990\nIt doesn't say read or read and write it\nsays custom because I didn't give them\n\n1001\n00:53:55,990 --> 00:54:00,040\nthe full permissions that come along with\nthose roles, with having that read access,\n\n1002\n00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,470\nor that read and write.\n\n1003\n00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:04,920\nI need to add the other things,\nthe things that I left off, okay.\n\n1004\n00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,110\nSo we can tack those on, the easiest way\nto do it is to look at an existing file\n\n1005\n00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:12,820\nthat already has what you need,\nright, so when I gave Jane read and\n\n1006\n00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:17,483\nwrite I should have also given her append,\nreadattr, writeattr,\n\n1007\n00:54:17,483 --> 00:54:21,600\nreadextattr, writeextattr and\nreadsecurity.\n\n1008\n00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,520\nI should've given her all of that also.\n\n1009\n00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,928\nAnd so what I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna do a little change mod.\n\n1010\n00:54:26,928 --> 00:54:32,630\n+a jane allow and\n\n1011\n00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:36,920\nI'm gonna specify all of those\nadditional attributes that I forgot.\n\n1012\n00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,100\nAnd then specify that it's file2.txt.\n\n1013\n00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,020\nSo, it's gonna add that on there and, oh!\n\n1014\n00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,610\nI got an unable to translate name,\n\n1015\n00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:47,780\nthe name didn't match up because\nit's not Jane, it's Jane Doe.\n\n1016\n00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:52,120\nSo, let me just add that on, Jane Doe.\n\n1017\n00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:56,770\nThere we go and that's gonna add those\npermissions back that I left off and\n\n1018\n00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:58,150\nI'll do the same for John Doe.\n\n1019\n00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:01,080\nHe needs to get these read attributes and\nread security.\n\n1020\n00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,380\nI need to add that to him.\n\n1021\n00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,870\nSo I'll do a +a for johndoe allow, and\n\n1022\n00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:12,990\nthen those permissions that I\nleft off all from file2.txt.\n\n1023\n00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,780\nAnd actually my head got on top of that.\n\n1024\n00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,780\nThere we go.\n\n1025\n00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,120\nJust file2.txt that add on.\n\n1026\n00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,640\nAll right, so now that those are set,\n\n1027\n00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:24,600\nthey have the full set of attributes\nthat they are supposed to have.\n\n1028\n00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,680\nBy doing ls-le,\nI can see there's Jane and John and\n\n1029\n00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,800\nthey've got the full set\nof permissions they need.\n\n1030\n00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,780\nAnd if I look back here, my screen is\nalready updated, see how Jane Doe and\n\n1031\n00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:39,400\nJohn Doe now actually show as read only\nand read and write, and not custom.\n\n1032\n00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,618\nSo be careful with that as you assign\nthese permissions when you create an ACL\n\n1033\n00:55:42,618 --> 00:55:45,449\nit can get far more specific than\nwhat the normal permissions are.\n\n1034\n00:55:45,449 --> 00:55:49,565\nWe don't see that in the GY, the GY\nmasks all that complexity for us, but\n\n1035\n00:55:49,565 --> 00:55:51,671\nin the command line we have to see it.\n\n1036\n00:55:51,671 --> 00:55:55,662\nAnd if I want to remove\nsomebody's permissions, well,\n\n1037\n00:55:55,662 --> 00:56:01,540\nall I need to do is if you do an ls-se\nyou can see the permissions they have.\n\n1038\n00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,720\nSo like here's John Doe's.\n\n1039\n00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,570\nI want to get him out of here.\n\n1040\n00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:10,377\nI'll just highlight all that,\nand I'll do a change mod minus A,\n\n1041\n00:56:10,377 --> 00:56:14,640\nand paste in his information for\nfile2.txt.\n\n1042\n00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,760\nI'm going to remove those permissions and\nnow he will no longer have access and\n\n1043\n00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,500\nso he's been removed from file2,\nall right.\n\n1044\n00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,570\nSo it's still done with chmod.\n\n1045\n00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:27,920\nSame command as before.\n\n1046\n00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,970\nBut this is that access list, this\nadditional information that goes beyond\n\n1047\n00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:33,410\nwhat's stored in regular Unix permissions.\n\n1048\n00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:36,830\nAll right.\n\n1049\n00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:40,700\nAnother question that we had\ninside of the break earlier was,\n\n1050\n00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,000\nhow do you change who the owner is or\nthe group, for that matter, right?\n\n1051\n00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,790\nI showed you guys in the GUI\n\n1052\n00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:49,270\nthat when we're looking at\nthe graphical user interface here,\n\n1053\n00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:53,530\nwe see that user as the owner of the file,\nright, they show up as the owner.\n\n1054\n00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:56,870\nAnd then the group right here,\nthat seems staff in this case.\n\n1055\n00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:59,690\nAnd we can change that if we\nwant right here in the UI.\n\n1056\n00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:02,890\nThat's great, but how do you change\nthat from the command prompt.\n\n1057\n00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,950\nIf I wanna change who the owner is or\n\n1058\n00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:09,860\nchange what group is attached to the file,\nyou can do that pretty easily.\n\n1059\n00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,710\nIt's with a different command though,\na command that we haven't seen.\n\n1060\n00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:16,730\nIt's the chown,\nwhich is the change owner command.\n\n1061\n00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:20,330\nAnd it lets you modify the user and\nthe group that belong to that file.\n\n1062\n00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,020\nIt's syntax is pretty straight forward.\n\n1063\n00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:26,930\nYou say chown, you specify who\nthe user is going to be followed\n\n1064\n00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:30,590\nby who the group is going to be, and then\nthe file or folders you want to effect and\n\n1065\n00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:35,060\nif you wanted to view cursor you could\ndo a dash R just like we saw earlier.\n\n1066\n00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:39,260\nTo make it apply to all the sub\nfolders and sub items like that too.\n\n1067\n00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:42,970\nOne thing about chown though,\nyou have to be an administrator to use it.\n\n1068\n00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:45,930\nIt won't let a regular\nuser change the ownership.\n\n1069\n00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,160\nA regular user creates\na file that belongs to them,\n\n1070\n00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,620\nit doesn't want to allow them\nto change it to somebody else.\n\n1071\n00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,140\nSo it's kind of locked down,\na little bit different there.\n\n1072\n00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:58,090\nSo if I want to change one of these files\nfor example, if I look at them right now,\n\n1073\n00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:02,030\nif I can actually get my syntax right,\nthere we go.\n\n1074\n00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:04,160\nWhen I look at file 1 through file 4,\n\n1075\n00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:09,070\nsee how they're all owned by me,\nand staff is the group, okay.\n\n1076\n00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,750\nWhat if I wanted to make admins the group?\n\n1077\n00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,370\nI don't want the admin\ngroup to be tied to it or\n\n1078\n00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:18,080\nwhat if I wanted to make Jane Doe to\nown one of these files and not me?\n\n1079\n00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,760\nI can modify that with chown.\n\n1080\n00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,870\nAll right.\n\n1081\n00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:25,400\nNow if I do chown and\nI follow it by a user, right, so\n\n1082\n00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:30,460\nI might say janedoe and then a colon and\nwhat I what the group to be.\n\n1083\n00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:33,460\nMaybe I want the group to still be staff,\nbut\n\n1084\n00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,360\nI just wanna change who\nthe user is that manages it.\n\n1085\n00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:42,210\nSo I can say,\nchown janedoe:staff file3.txt.\n\n1086\n00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:42,980\nOkay.\n\n1087\n00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,510\nNow notice I got\nan operation not permitted.\n\n1088\n00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:47,180\nI'm logged in as an admin.\n\n1089\n00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,650\nBut when you're in the terminal window,\n\n1090\n00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,310\nyou can't use administrative\ncommands by default.\n\n1091\n00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:54,845\nYou have to use these\nsudo command to do it.\n\n1092\n00:58:54,845 --> 00:58:56,680\nS-U is superuser.\n\n1093\n00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,920\nAnd do, it means you're doing\na command as the superuser.\n\n1094\n00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,380\nSo I'm elevating my privileges to run it.\n\n1095\n00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,090\nAnd when I do that it's gonna ask me for\n\n1096\n00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:08,790\nmy administrative password which I'll\nprovide, and then the command will work.\n\n1097\n00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:09,330\nAll right.\n\n1098\n00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:12,430\nThat's where I mentioned you have\nto be an administrator to do this.\n\n1099\n00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:16,450\nNow if I do a ls-l I can see file 3\n\n1100\n00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:21,390\nshows an owner of Jane Doe and\nthe group is still staff.\n\n1101\n00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:22,900\nAll right, let's take file4.\n\n1102\n00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,370\nI wanna change file4 to\nhave a group of admin.\n\n1103\n00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,435\nAll right, so I can say chown.\n\n1104\n00:59:28,435 --> 00:59:30,370\nOops, I'm about to\nforget what I just said.\n\n1105\n00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:36,190\nI'm gonna precede that with sudo chown and\nI'll say donpezet.\n\n1106\n00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:39,575\nI'll stay the owner and\nadmin for the group.\n\n1107\n00:59:39,575 --> 00:59:42,665\nfile4.txt, all right?\n\n1108\n00:59:42,665 --> 00:59:47,260\nNow that I've run that, if I do an ls -l,\n\n1109\n00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:51,760\nI can see that I'm still the owner,\nbut admin is now the group.\n\n1110\n00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,791\nAnd in the GUI, if I want to go and\nverify this, I can just jump back here and\n\n1111\n00:59:56,791 --> 01:00:02,920\ntake file4, pull up it's info, and\nI'll see right there, Don Pezet.\n\n1112\n01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,010\nI'm the owner.\n\n1113\n01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:08,200\nAdmin is now the group, and everyone,\nwell they still have no access,\n\n1114\n01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,180\nnothing exciting there.\n\n1115\n01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,415\nSo pretty straightforward command or,\n\n1116\n01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,241\nit's just a different command\nfrom what we're used to it.\n\n1117\n01:00:14,241 --> 01:00:14,908\nAll right.\n\n1118\n01:00:14,908 --> 01:00:17,350\nWe got to see access control lists.\n\n1119\n01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:22,360\nACLs where we use the chmod command\nto add extended entries onto there.\n\n1120\n01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,180\nAnd we got to see the chown or\n\n1121\n01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:28,760\nchange owner when we modified the user and\ngroup that belonged to it so.\n\n1122\n01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,460\nYeah.\n\n1123\n01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,950\nAnd but that's basically it.\n\n1124\n01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:32,660\nYou're just adding information on there.\n\n1125\n01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,870\nAnd that stuff that Apple has created\nto make the system more flexible and\n\n1126\n01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:36,650\nuseful for us.\n\n1127\n01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:37,760\nIt's very powerful stuff.\n\n1128\n01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,260\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n1129\n01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:40,410\nAll right.\n\n1130\n01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,760\nYeah, thanks again, guys in the chat room.\n\n1131\n01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,090\nThat's good stuff to add on to here.\n\n1132\n01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:45,170\nI don't know if that'll\nturn up on the exam.\n\n1133\n01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:47,680\nBut it's definitely worth knowing,\ncuz you might use that in real life.\n\n1134\n01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:50,290\nAll right.\nSo\n\n1135\n01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:53,230\nthat's pretty much it for file ownership.\n\n1136\n01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:54,580\nLet's see.\nWhat was I oh.\n\n1137\n01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:58,330\n[LAUGH] Before we went to the break,\nI was starting to talk about drop boxes.\n\n1138\n01:00:58,330 --> 01:00:58,910\nAll right?\n\n1139\n01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:01,570\nAnd I mentioned how there were drop\nboxes where users could go and\n\n1140\n01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:03,260\ncopy files into them.\n\n1141\n01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,220\nAnd we'd then have access to it.\n\n1142\n01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:09,315\nAnd how our home folder already had one\nof those created, and I wanted to go on\n\n1143\n01:01:09,315 --> 01:01:12,625\na little tour of the permissions that\nwere found inside of a home folder.\n\n1144\n01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:16,185\nBut I realized during the break,\na lot of stuff happens during the break,\n\n1145\n01:01:16,185 --> 01:01:18,785\nI realized I never actually\nshowed the drop boxes working.\n\n1146\n01:01:18,785 --> 01:01:22,965\nSo let me give you an example of that so\nyou can see how the drop boxes work.\n\n1147\n01:01:22,965 --> 01:01:25,685\nI'm gonna switch over to Jane Doe.\n\n1148\n01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:30,760\nAnd let's say that Jane is working\non a document for John Doe.\n\n1149\n01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,780\nShe wants to share it with John,\nall right, but\n\n1150\n01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,300\nshe doesn't have access to John's\nfolders or anything like that.\n\n1151\n01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,870\nShe just wants to give him a copy so\nhe can work with it, and\n\n1152\n01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,980\nshe doesn't want to share out\nher home directory, right?\n\n1153\n01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:44,530\nNo sense in weakening security, it just\nneeds to be a secure exchange, all right?\n\n1154\n01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,120\nSo what you can do is you can go in and\ncreate her file, right?\n\n1155\n01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,060\nIn her documents folder.\n\n1156\n01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:54,960\nNow, she's the only one who has access to\nthe documents folder in her own profile.\n\n1157\n01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,060\nSo it's limited to just her.\n\n1158\n01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:02,440\nSo this is a secret document, I'm just\ncreating that secret document here.\n\n1159\n01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:10,180\nI'll go ahead and save that and\nI'll just call it secret.text, or RTF.\n\n1160\n01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:10,800\nAll right.\n\n1161\n01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,675\nNow as long as it's in the documents\nfolder in her profile only she has access.\n\n1162\n01:02:14,675 --> 01:02:19,340\nBut what she can do is she can\nbrowse the hard drive, oop\n\n1163\n01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:25,130\nthat's not what I wanted, and she can\nbrowse over to someone else's profile.\n\n1164\n01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:26,720\nI'm gonna open up another finder window.\n\n1165\n01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,350\nI'll just go up here to the go and\n\n1166\n01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:34,860\nchoose go to folder, and\nI'm gonna jump to somebody else's folder.\n\n1167\n01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:40,160\nI'm gonna browse through /users and\nI can see Jane Doe and\n\n1168\n01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,620\nit's got a little house icon,\nthat's my profile I'm logged in as Jane.\n\n1169\n01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,480\nAnd here's John's profile.\n\n1170\n01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:49,740\nAnd you might think that she would\nhave no access to John's folder, but\n\n1171\n01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,140\nthat's not the case.\n\n1172\n01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,360\nIf she browses into John's folder,\n\n1173\n01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,390\nsure most of these files\nshe doesn't have access to.\n\n1174\n01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:58,860\nShe doesn't have access to his documents,\nhis downloads, his movies, whatever.\n\n1175\n01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,480\nBut she does have access\nto his public folder.\n\n1176\n01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:05,250\nIf John wants to share something\nwith everybody on the computer,\n\n1177\n01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:08,500\nhe can just stick it in that public\nfolder, and everybody'll have access.\n\n1178\n01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,380\nBut this is a secret document.\n\n1179\n01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,750\nI don't want everybody\nto have access to it.\n\n1180\n01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:14,590\nI want just John to have access to it.\n\n1181\n01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,670\nWhen I browse in the public,\n\n1182\n01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:19,480\nI'll see that John has a drop box folder\nalready created there by default.\n\n1183\n01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,845\nAnd if I double click on it,\nI don't have permission to open it.\n\n1184\n01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:26,395\nI can not see what's in the drop box.\n\n1185\n01:03:26,395 --> 01:03:32,175\nBut, I can take my document,\nthis secret.tech,\n\n1186\n01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:36,385\nI can drag it and\ndrop it right on drop box, okay?\n\n1187\n01:03:36,385 --> 01:03:40,480\nAnd it's telling me I can put it in the\ndrop box but I won't be able to see it.\n\n1188\n01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,810\nIn other words this is a one way thing.\n\n1189\n01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:42,800\nOnce it's in there it's gone.\n\n1190\n01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,510\nI can't get at it anymore.\n\n1191\n01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:45,799\nI'll say okay.\n\n1192\n01:03:45,799 --> 01:03:46,959\nAnd there it goes.\n\n1193\n01:03:46,959 --> 01:03:49,316\nI just sent a copy over to John.\n\n1194\n01:03:49,316 --> 01:03:51,021\nNow if I change my mind,\nI wanna get that back.\n\n1195\n01:03:51,021 --> 01:03:52,661\nYou can't, right?\n\n1196\n01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:53,437\nI can't open it.\n\n1197\n01:03:53,437 --> 01:03:54,540\nI can't see what's in there.\n\n1198\n01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:55,459\nIt's out of my control.\n\n1199\n01:03:55,459 --> 01:03:59,370\nJust like at the post office, the package\nwent in the mail slot, it's gone.\n\n1200\n01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:01,806\nYou can't get it back,\nit's going, all right?\n\n1201\n01:04:01,806 --> 01:04:07,470\nMeanwhile, John,\ncan jump back over to him.\n\n1202\n01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:12,410\nSo, I'll log in as John, and\nJohn can browse into his public folder.\n\n1203\n01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:13,658\nHe can get right into it.\n\n1204\n01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:23,150\nAnd once he jumps in there,\nhe'll see his Dropbox folder.\n\n1205\n01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:29,110\nAnd there's the secret file that she\ncopied over so he can open that up,\n\n1206\n01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:33,480\nhe can read the document, he can see the\ninformation, he has full control over it.\n\n1207\n01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:38,338\nShe was able to copy it in and\nnow only John has access, right.\n\n1208\n01:04:38,338 --> 01:04:40,790\nIf she had put it in the public folder,\n\n1209\n01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:43,190\nthen everyone else on the computer\nwould have access too.\n\n1210\n01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:45,880\nBy doing it this way,\nonly John has access.\n\n1211\n01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,180\nAll right, so that right there,\n\n1212\n01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:51,270\nthat's basically what you expect\nto see with Dropbox functionality.\n\n1213\n01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:57,220\nNow, you probably noticed when\nJane browsed to his folder,\n\n1214\n01:04:58,530 --> 01:04:59,500\nshe was able to do that.\n\n1215\n01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:03,325\nShe was able to browse into John's folder,\nall right?\n\n1216\n01:05:03,325 --> 01:05:05,450\nThis is John's home folder right here.\n\n1217\n01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:09,158\nAnd she saw all these other folders that\nwere in here, but she doesn't have access.\n\n1218\n01:05:09,158 --> 01:05:12,360\nIf she double-clicks on Documents,\nyou don't have access, right?\n\n1219\n01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,805\nIf she double-clicks on Downloads,\nshe doesn't have access.\n\n1220\n01:05:14,805 --> 01:05:18,980\nIf she double-clicks on Public,\nshe sees that, right?\n\n1221\n01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:23,530\nAnd if she tries to copy something to it,\nwell, she doesn't have access, right?\n\n1222\n01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:26,533\nSo, she can read, but she can't write.\n\n1223\n01:05:26,533 --> 01:05:31,274\nThat's important to note because watch\nwhat happens if I switch back over\n\n1224\n01:05:31,274 --> 01:05:35,951\nto John, and I copy some files to\nsome different locations, all right?\n\n1225\n01:05:35,951 --> 01:05:38,658\nLet's get some of these copied here.\n\n1226\n01:05:38,658 --> 01:05:41,540\nI'll just work with this same secret file,\nall right?\n\n1227\n01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,992\nSo, here I am in John's account.\n\n1228\n01:05:43,992 --> 01:05:48,826\nAnd I'm going to put a copy of that secret\nfile right here in the public folder on\n\n1229\n01:05:48,826 --> 01:05:50,741\nJohn's profile, all right?\n\n1230\n01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:52,100\nSo, I've got a copy of it here.\n\n1231\n01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:57,205\nAnd then, I'm going to put a copy of\nthat file right here in my own profile,\n\n1232\n01:05:57,205 --> 01:05:57,866\nall right?\n\n1233\n01:05:57,866 --> 01:06:01,400\nI'm just copying that file in a few\ndifferent places and getting it out there.\n\n1234\n01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:08,943\nIf you look at the permissions on\nthat file Here's the permissions,\n\n1235\n01:06:08,943 --> 01:06:11,283\nand I can see the default\npermissions have been applied.\n\n1236\n01:06:11,283 --> 01:06:13,911\nAnd if I leave it that way,\njust leaving it at the defaults,\n\n1237\n01:06:13,911 --> 01:06:15,760\nwatch what happens when I switch to Jane.\n\n1238\n01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:22,430\nWhen I log in as Jane,\nshe can browse the hard drive,\n\n1239\n01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:24,570\nshe can browse over to John's folder.\n\n1240\n01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,130\nThat's where I am right now.\n\n1241\n01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:27,670\nActually, let me go full circle.\n\n1242\n01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:30,910\nI want to make sure we see the exact\nprocess I'm going through here.\n\n1243\n01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:35,240\nAll right, so\nI'm going to navigate to John's folder.\n\n1244\n01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,992\nSo, I'm going to navigate here and\nI'll see John Doe.\n\n1245\n01:06:37,992 --> 01:06:39,278\nAnd when I browse there,\n\n1246\n01:06:39,278 --> 01:06:42,408\nthere's that secret file that\nhe put in his own home folder.\n\n1247\n01:06:42,408 --> 01:06:46,490\nAnd while I don't have write permissions,\nI do have read.\n\n1248\n01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:48,780\nI can open it up and I can look at it.\n\n1249\n01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:52,990\nAnd if I go into his public folder,\nI can open that up and I can look at it.\n\n1250\n01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:54,200\nAll right?\n\n1251\n01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:59,810\nIf John wants to keep his documents safe,\nsecure, and private, it's important\n\n1252\n01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:03,010\nthat he know not to put it in the public\nfolder, that one's common sense.\n\n1253\n01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:05,970\nBut not to put it in his folder either.\n\n1254\n01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:11,220\nUsers should not put things\nin their root home directory,\n\n1255\n01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:14,160\nbecause it's everyone\nread access by default.\n\n1256\n01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,610\nAnyone with a valid user\naccount on that computer will\n\n1257\n01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:22,270\nbe able to browse to that folder, and read\nthe documents that are in the root of it.\n\n1258\n01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:23,310\nAll right?\n\n1259\n01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:26,520\nIf John had just put it in his\nDocuments folder, it'd be safe.\n\n1260\n01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,390\nOther people can't get to that, all right?\n\n1261\n01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:30,690\nThis is something a lot\nof people don't realize.\n\n1262\n01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:34,160\nPeople don't realize that their\nhome directory's root folder, so\n\n1263\n01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,090\nit's /user/username.\n\n1264\n01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:41,090\nThat folder,\nhas everyone read assigned to it.\n\n1265\n01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:43,260\nSo, anything you put in there,\nyou might as well be putting in public.\n\n1266\n01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,470\nIt's actually the same\npermissions as public.\n\n1267\n01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:46,900\nSo, all of your documents,\n\n1268\n01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:50,170\nall of your private information\nreally needs to go in a sub folder.\n\n1269\n01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:53,500\nIt needs to go, on Desktop,\nDocuments, Downloads, Movies,\n\n1270\n01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,560\nMusic, Pictures, in one of those.\n\n1271\n01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,300\nRight?\n\n1272\n01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:59,242\nNot in the root itself.\n\n1273\n01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:03,360\nThat's an easy gotcha right there, where\npeople think data is safe and secure, and\n\n1274\n01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:03,950\nit isn't.\n\n1275\n01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:04,577\nAll right?\nAnd\n\n1276\n01:08:04,577 --> 01:08:08,021\nit applies not just to regular users\nlike these, even administrators,\n\n1277\n01:08:08,021 --> 01:08:10,741\nif they were to browse into\nthe DonPezet folder, right?\n\n1278\n01:08:10,741 --> 01:08:11,760\nI'm an admin.\n\n1279\n01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,410\nAnd now, they can see my root profile,\nand we have to have that access because\n\n1280\n01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:17,993\notherwise they wouldn't be\nable to get to public, and\n\n1281\n01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:21,026\nthen they wouldn't be able to get\nto the Dropbox folder itself,\n\n1282\n01:08:21,026 --> 01:08:24,658\nthat's why it's done that way but\nit does require a little user education.\n\n1283\n01:08:24,658 --> 01:08:26,320\nDon't put stuff in your home folder.\n\n1284\n01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,559\nAnd that's why also when\nyou go into the finder,\n\n1285\n01:08:28,559 --> 01:08:32,450\ndo you ever notice how your home directory\ndoesn't show up in the finder by default?\n\n1286\n01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:33,710\nDoesn't that seem odd?\n\n1287\n01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:37,840\nWouldn't you think, why wouldn't\nApple add my own home folder here?\n\n1288\n01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,480\nAnd the reason is they\nare protecting you from yourself.\n\n1289\n01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,930\nWe don't want to show it cuz then\nyou might put stuff there and\n\n1290\n01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:44,020\nyou really shouldn't.\n\n1291\n01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:47,630\nInstead, we're going to show you your\nDocuments folder or your Desktop or\n\n1292\n01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:51,010\nyour Downloads, cuz you can put\nstuff there and it will be safe.\n\n1293\n01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:54,241\nDon't put it in your root,\n/users/username.\n\n1294\n01:08:54,241 --> 01:08:56,650\nDon't put it in that folder\nbecause it's got open permissions.\n\n1295\n01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:58,790\nDefinitely be aware of that.\n\n1296\n01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:01,908\nAnd in the show notes,\nlet me pull up my show notes.\n\n1297\n01:09:01,908 --> 01:09:04,533\nWhere are my show notes today?\n\n1298\n01:09:04,533 --> 01:09:06,450\nActually do I not have my show notes open?\n\n1299\n01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:07,420\nThat happens.\n\n1300\n01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:09,110\nLet me bring up the show notes just so\n\n1301\n01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:12,330\nthat I can show you guys\nwhat I am talking about.\n\n1302\n01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:17,504\nI went ahead and put in the show\nnotes a summary of the default\n\n1303\n01:09:17,504 --> 01:09:21,658\npermissions that are assigned\nto one of those.\n\n1304\n01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:25,366\nHere, you guys can see what\nI do in my spare time.\n\n1305\n01:09:25,366 --> 01:09:28,050\nLet me just get to these real quick.\n\n1306\n01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:31,866\nPut this in a format that will\nlook a little better on screen.\n\n1307\n01:09:31,866 --> 01:09:32,366\nHere we go.\n\n1308\n01:09:32,366 --> 01:09:34,440\nAll right, so this is in the show notes.\n\n1309\n01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,500\nIt'll be published with this on\nthe website, but I basically listed out\n\n1310\n01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,325\na user's home directory and\nwhat those default permissions are.\n\n1311\n01:09:40,325 --> 01:09:44,398\nNotice /user/donpezet,\nthat would be my root.\n\n1312\n01:09:44,398 --> 01:09:51,033\nSee how the Group has read and execute and\nEveryone has read and execute.\n\n1313\n01:09:51,033 --> 01:09:54,560\nEveryone has read access\nto that default folder.\n\n1314\n01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,990\nThen, if you look at Desktop, Documents,\nDownloads, Libraries, Movies,\n\n1315\n01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:01,720\nMusic, Pictures, all those guys,\nthere's dashes all the way down the line.\n\n1316\n01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:05,450\nOkay, the Group has read,\nbut Everyone has nothing.\n\n1317\n01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:08,010\nThose are all protected\nuntil we get down to public.\n\n1318\n01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:08,530\nAll right.\n\n1319\n01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:11,100\nPublic, read and execute for the Group.\n\n1320\n01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,490\nAnd read and execute for Everyone.\n\n1321\n01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:15,700\nEverybody can read that public folder.\n\n1322\n01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,930\nAnd then, same thing for that drop box\nexcept a little bit different, I guess.\n\n1323\n01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:20,220\nIt's not the same thing.\n\n1324\n01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,781\nI don't know why I said that.\n\n1325\n01:10:21,781 --> 01:10:25,057\n[LAUGH] But you'll see where\nthe Group has write and execute and\n\n1326\n01:10:25,057 --> 01:10:29,250\nthe Everyone has write and\nexecute, but they don't have read.\n\n1327\n01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:31,680\nThose are those default permissions for\nthose folders.\n\n1328\n01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,140\nYou need to know those for the exam.\n\n1329\n01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:34,040\nThose do turn up.\n\n1330\n01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,700\nThis is definitely something you\nwanna be aware of all right?\n\n1331\n01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:40,284\nThe moral of the story,\ndon't put stuff in your root folder.\n\n1332\n01:10:40,284 --> 01:10:40,784\nAll right.\n\n1333\n01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,580\nTerry in the chat room just posted,\n\n1334\n01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:49,990\ndoes that mean that all the hidden\ndot files are not protected?\n\n1335\n01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:52,075\nWell, it depends on where they are.\n\n1336\n01:10:52,075 --> 01:10:55,906\nNow, the dot files he's talking about,\nyou have a lot of configuration files,\n\n1337\n01:10:55,906 --> 01:10:58,200\nthey get stored inside of your directory.\n\n1338\n01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,075\nAnd some of them are really sensitive,\nright?\n\n1339\n01:11:00,075 --> 01:11:03,283\nLet me show you an example.\n\n1340\n01:11:03,283 --> 01:11:04,283\nWhat'd be a good one?\n\n1341\n01:11:04,283 --> 01:11:06,908\nLet me get back to my terminal.\n\n1342\n01:11:06,908 --> 01:11:09,450\nLet me switch back to an admin user,\nand I'll show you.\n\n1343\n01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:13,650\nSo, a great example would\nbe something like SSH keys.\n\n1344\n01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:17,950\nWhen you SSH into a host,\nthe keys get stored in a file.\n\n1345\n01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:26,783\nIf I change into my home directory, Oops.\n\n1346\n01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:28,760\nAll right, and I pull up my directory.\n\n1347\n01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,420\nI see things like Desktop, Documents,\nDownloads, Library, and so on.\n\n1348\n01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:38,160\nBut if I do a ls -a,\nthat'll show even hidden ones.\n\n1349\n01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:42,352\nAnd say, you've got .trash and\n.bash history, some of these are files but\n\n1350\n01:11:42,352 --> 01:11:45,206\nthere's some folders that\nget stored that way too.\n\n1351\n01:11:45,206 --> 01:11:49,396\nIf you're using SSH, your keys get\nstored in a folder called .ssh.\n\n1352\n01:11:49,396 --> 01:11:50,918\nAnd the dot means that it's hidden.\n\n1353\n01:11:50,918 --> 01:11:52,660\nIt's hidden so people can't see it.\n\n1354\n01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:57,601\nWell, when that's created it's up\nto whoever wrote that software\n\n1355\n01:11:57,601 --> 01:12:00,380\nwhether they protect it or not.\n\n1356\n01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:02,810\nIf they don't choose to protect it,\nthen no.\n\n1357\n01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:05,080\nIt might be hidden from view but\n\n1358\n01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,195\nother people can still get at\nit if they know it's there,\n\n1359\n01:12:07,195 --> 01:12:11,995\nand with SSH it would be really bad,\nbecause that data you wanna protect.\n\n1360\n01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:17,745\nFor example,\nlet's say I wanted to SSH into a server,\n\n1361\n01:12:17,745 --> 01:12:20,435\nwhat would be a good server for\nme to connect to?\n\n1362\n01:12:20,435 --> 01:12:21,185\nTry this.\n\n1363\n01:12:21,185 --> 01:12:25,295\nI don't know if that one is open for\nconnections or not.\n\n1364\n01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,250\nWell shoot.\nApparently it's not.\n\n1365\n01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:32,856\nI guess I could turn on\nSSH on my own system.\n\n1366\n01:12:32,856 --> 01:12:37,920\n[LAUGH]\nLet's see if we can do that real quick.\n\n1367\n01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,700\nBut basically what it's gonna do is it's\ngoing to store those keys in that folder,\n\n1368\n01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:43,770\nand you want to make\nsure that's protected.\n\n1369\n01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:45,480\nNow in the case of SSH it absolutely is.\n\n1370\n01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,630\nIt does protect that.\n\n1371\n01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:48,480\nI'm not too worried about that.\n\n1372\n01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,510\nBut other software,\nif they don't take the proper precautions,\n\n1373\n01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:55,660\nthen you are leaving yourself\nopen to potential risk there.\n\n1374\n01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:59,640\nYou know, you can get where your\ndata is compromised that way.\n\n1375\n01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:04,190\nAnd I say it's compromised, it's not\nreally compromised, it's just really just\n\n1376\n01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:09,210\ncompromised in terms of if somebody\nelse has a valid account on your system.\n\n1377\n01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:11,020\nThey could login and get at it.\n\n1378\n01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:14,470\nIf you enable the guest account,\nguest can get into your system.\n\n1379\n01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:16,280\nGuest is part of the everyone group,\n\n1380\n01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,940\nwhich means they'd be able to\nread from your root home folders.\n\n1381\n01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:22,270\nSo definitely something\nwe wanna be aware of.\n\n1382\n01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:28,710\nI'm trying to find real quick, somewhere\nin here, I can turn on SSH there we go.\n\n1383\n01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:37,430\nAnd let's go ahead and\nturn this one on too.\n\n1384\n01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:38,820\nAll right.\nLet's see if I can SSH into\n\n1385\n01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,570\nmy own host now.\n\n1386\n01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,920\nJust trying to connect something,\nthere we go.\n\n1387\n01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:51,270\nSo I'm connecting to an SSH host, and\nsee it prompted me about a key there, and\n\n1388\n01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:54,870\nthat key it learns it and\nthen it stores it.\n\n1389\n01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:55,700\nAnd so\n\n1390\n01:13:55,700 --> 01:14:00,650\nif I look at my home directory, there's\nthat .SSH folder that it just created.\n\n1391\n01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:03,210\nBut look at the permissions\nthat it assigned.\n\n1392\n01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:07,280\nIt was smart enough to assign me as\nthe user, read, write, and execute.\n\n1393\n01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,850\nBut nobody else has access,\nso those keys are secure.\n\n1394\n01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:14,740\nSo when I change into that folder,\n\n1395\n01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:17,930\nmy keys are actually stored right\nhere in this known host folder.\n\n1396\n01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:22,260\nIf somebody were to get a hold of these\nkeys they could take over my system.\n\n1397\n01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:25,210\nThey could decrypt my data that I was\nencrypting across the network, or\n\n1398\n01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,110\nat least authenticate it.\n\n1399\n01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:28,090\nRight?\nThat information is tied in there.\n\n1400\n01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:29,410\nThat would be really bad.\n\n1401\n01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:30,520\nRight?\nWe wouldn't want somebody to get\n\n1402\n01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:31,430\naccess to these.\n\n1403\n01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:34,300\nWell, I guess in this scenario,\nthat key is just a public key.\n\n1404\n01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,600\nSo it wouldn't be that bad.\n\n1405\n01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,040\nBut, there's other things that might\nbe stored in here that could be.\n\n1406\n01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:39,590\nRisky.\nYou know,\n\n1407\n01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:40,720\nthings that we don't want to get out.\n\n1408\n01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,410\nAnd then that would be\na little bit more dangerous.\n\n1409\n01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:47,070\nSo, just be aware that the home folder is\nnot as secure as you might think it is.\n\n1410\n01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:51,320\nThe subfolders are.\n\n1411\n01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:56,870\nAll right let's see so Terry asked\nabout permissions propagating down.\n\n1412\n01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:01,210\nBy default when you create a folder\nit will inherit the permissions of\n\n1413\n01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:01,850\nthe parent folder.\n\n1414\n01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:03,930\nAnd then those permissions trickle down.\n\n1415\n01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:05,600\nSo he's asking about executables.\n\n1416\n01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:11,540\nIf I put an executable in there and\nthe folder has permissions to execute,\n\n1417\n01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:14,290\nwill that application I copy\nin have permissions too?\n\n1418\n01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:18,160\nWell, normally it would, but\nApple actually overrides that.\n\n1419\n01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,200\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n1420\n01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,370\nThere is actually a special\nfolder that you don't see.\n\n1421\n01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:25,000\nThese are all the little exceptions.\n\n1422\n01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,750\nWhen you go to your own home folder.\n\n1423\n01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:29,890\nWhoops let me just use my home.\n\n1424\n01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:30,520\nShortcut here.\n\n1425\n01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:35,420\nSo if I go to my home folder, I see\nDesktop, Documents, Downloads, and so on.\n\n1426\n01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:40,350\nIf I put applications in any of these,\n\n1427\n01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:42,560\nMac OS will actually prevent them\nfrom running, it won't let them run.\n\n1428\n01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:48,600\nIf I want applications to run, they either\nneed to go into the main applications\n\n1429\n01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,860\nfolder, /applications\non the hard drive but\n\n1430\n01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:55,710\na regular user doesn't have permission\nto write to that, so a regular user\n\n1431\n01:15:55,710 --> 01:16:01,320\ncannot install application unless they\ncreate their own executable area.\n\n1432\n01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,150\nIf you create a folder here\nin your user profile, right?\n\n1433\n01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:07,140\nSo if I create a new folder in here and\nI just call it test.\n\n1434\n01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:11,680\nSee how it's just a regular folder,\nno special icon or anything like that?\n\n1435\n01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:15,340\nIf I create a folder called Applications,\nthough, watch what happens.\n\n1436\n01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:17,950\nSee how it got a special icon?\n\n1437\n01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:20,540\nThe Mac sees that.\n\n1438\n01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:23,900\nIt sees it and it says, oh you wanna\nbe able to run applications for\n\n1439\n01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:24,642\nyour user account.\n\n1440\n01:16:24,642 --> 01:16:28,100\nAll right, this is a special folder,\nI'll mark it for applications.\n\n1441\n01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:33,220\nAnd now a regular end user can throw\napplications in there and run them, right?\n\n1442\n01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:36,470\nBut there's very strict rules\nthat apply to these applications.\n\n1443\n01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:38,700\nThey run as your user and\n\n1444\n01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:42,750\nthey'll only have access to\nresources that you do as a user.\n\n1445\n01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:45,730\nVersus applications that run out\nof a real applications folder,\n\n1446\n01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:47,490\nthey may have access to the whole system.\n\n1447\n01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:50,840\nTo a lot of administrative activities,\nthese applications will not.\n\n1448\n01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,830\nSo it's like a special\nprotected applications folder.\n\n1449\n01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:58,747\nAnd that's what is kinda protecting your\nsystem from having rogue executables as\n\n1450\n01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:02,963\npart of Apple's anti-malware stance,\nwhich is really effective.\n\n1451\n01:17:06,701 --> 01:17:10,343\nAll right, so just a couple of\nhighlights there on special permissions,\n\n1452\n01:17:10,343 --> 01:17:12,530\npermissions that are assigned by default.\n\n1453\n01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:14,840\nWe got a chance to see ACLs, right?\n\n1454\n01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,750\nAccess Control Lists, we saw the drop box,\nwe got to see a lot of neat stuff.\n\n1455\n01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:23,920\nThe only thing that I haven't talked\nabout to this point, is the sticky bit,\n\n1456\n01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,210\nand repairing broken permissions.\n\n1457\n01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:28,410\nThose are two other things\nthat I need to get to.\n\n1458\n01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:29,660\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\n\n1459\n01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:31,530\nwe still have quite a few things\nto talk about with permissions.\n\n1460\n01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:35,530\nI know I've still got the sticky bit\nto get into and the shared folder,\n\n1461\n01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:38,010\na couple other neat little\nthings with removable media.\n\n1462\n01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:41,170\nBut this is a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap up this episode,\n\n1463\n01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:42,900\nwe're starting to get\na little long on time.\n\n1464\n01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,600\nSo, what we'll do is, we'll wrap up here.\n\n1465\n01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:48,020\nStay tuned because we'll have a part two\ncoming up where we tackle the additional\n\n1466\n01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:50,160\nfile permission topics that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n1467\n01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,420\nPretty neat stuff that's out there,\n\n1468\n01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:53,680\nall the, you know,\ncrazy exceptions and things.\n\n1469\n01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,590\nSo definitely stay tuned for that.\n\n1470\n01:17:55,590 -->

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:40,262\nAnd welcome back to another episode\nof ITProTV, I'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n6\n00:00:40,262 --> 00:00:44,790\nback again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n7\n00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,833\nWe left off with a cliffhanger in the last\nepisode as we were moving through file\n\n8\n00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:52,326\npermissions, and so we're gonna\npick back up with that today, and\n\n9\n00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:56,430\ntackle some really bizarre and\nspecial use case scenario permissions.\n\n10\n00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,300\nThat are things that you're really\nnot gonna encounter all that much in\n\n11\n00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,810\nreal life land, but you will on the exam,\nso this is kind of an interesting episode.\n\n12\n00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:10,370\nAt the end of the last episode,\nI mentioned something called a sticky bit.\n\n13\n00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,369\nI didn't really elaborate on it much\nmore than it has a silly name, and so\n\n14\n00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:14,760\nnow's the time for me to do that.\n\n15\n00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,460\nLet's talk about this sticky bit and\nwhat it is.\n\n16\n00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,930\nWhen you do a default install\nof Mac OS Yosemite, when you\n\n17\n00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,520\nput that default install in, there's\na folder that's created called Shared, and\n\n18\n00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,900\nthat Shared folder is\ndesigned to be shared,\n\n19\n00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,810\nthus the name, amongst all\nthe local users on your computer.\n\n20\n00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,040\nSo, for example, on my computer I've\ngot Don Pezet, I've got Jane Doe and\n\n21\n00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,810\nI've got John Doe.\n\n22\n00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,155\nI've got three different user\naccounts all in this one computer.\n\n23\n00:01:42,155 --> 00:01:47,320\nWell, all three accounts have\naccess to that Shared folder, and\n\n24\n00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,970\nall three accounts can\nwrite data to that folder.\n\n25\n00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,620\nThe idea is that if I want to share\nsomething with another user, and\n\n26\n00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,980\nI'm not worried about it being secret,\n\n27\n00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:59,100\nthen I can put it in that Shared folder\nand we can all have access to it.\n\n28\n00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,300\nBut the Shared folder has\na really special property to it.\n\n29\n00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,324\nCuz so far, it doesn't really sound any\ndifferent than the public folder that we\n\n30\n00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:08,370\nhave in our user profile, does it?\n\n31\n00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,740\nWhat it has that's different is,\nif I put a file in the Shared folder,\n\n32\n00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,710\nthe other users can see it,\nbut they can't delete it.\n\n33\n00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,750\nDeleting is blocked.\n\n34\n00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,270\nOnly the owner of the file\nis able to delete.\n\n35\n00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,350\nAnd that means that more than\none person can store stuff\n\n36\n00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,990\nsafely in the shared folder without having\nto worry about other users deleting it.\n\n37\n00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,920\nNow, when we looked at\nthe permissions the other day,\n\n38\n00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,340\nwe saw where there were read and\nwrite and execute.\n\n39\n00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,280\nThere really wasn't a permission for\ndeleting, was there?\n\n40\n00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,620\nRight, deleting is technically\na type of writing, but\n\n41\n00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,650\nit is different cuz you're\nactually removing the file.\n\n42\n00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,080\nWell, it's the sticky\nbit that controls that.\n\n43\n00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,480\nThe sticky bit is a special type of\npermission that can be assigned to\n\n44\n00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,030\nthe everyone group that says,\nif you create a file,\n\n45\n00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,790\nthe file is now stuck to you.\n\n46\n00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,510\nYou're the owner, you made it.\n\n47\n00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,150\nYou're allowed to delete it, but\nnobody else is allowed to delete it.\n\n48\n00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,150\nThe file is stuck right where it is,\nunless the owner or\n\n49\n00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,230\nan administrator removes it.\n\n50\n00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,680\nOther people can see it, other people can\nwork with it, but they can't delete it\n\n51\n00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,950\nbecause it's stuck to the original owner,\nthat's why they call it a sticky bit.\n\n52\n00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,440\nAnd it's a bit.\n\n53\n00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,900\nOur permissions are all stored\nin little bit values, and\n\n54\n00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,660\nthis replaces the last bit\nof the everyone permissions.\n\n55\n00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,150\nRemember the everyone permissions\nare represented in three values,\n\n56\n00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,880\nread, write, and execute.\n\n57\n00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,660\nThe sticky bit actually\nreplaces the execute bit.\n\n58\n00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,220\nNow, me just talking about\nit is a little confusing, so\n\n59\n00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,900\nlet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n60\n00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,760\nI've got a computer fired up here, and\nI'm gonna jump over to a different user.\n\n61\n00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,070\nI'll jump over to old JaneDoe here and\njust get logged in.\n\n62\n00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,690\nAnd for Jane, she's just a regular user,\nnot an administrator or\n\n63\n00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,340\nanything like that, and\nshe's logged in on this computer.\n\n64\n00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,230\nAnd if she browses to\nthe computer's root folder, right?\n\n65\n00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:08,270\nSo if I jump to my root of the drive,\nshe'll see various folders in here,\n\n66\n00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,560\nApplications, Library, System,\nUsers, stuff like that.\n\n67\n00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,930\nIf she takes a look at her Documents,\nher Downloads,\n\n68\n00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,150\nthese are all things she has access\nto that are available to her.\n\n69\n00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,160\nRight, they're just available to her.\n\n70\n00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,980\nBut, if she goes back\nto that root folder and\n\n71\n00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,110\ngoes into Users,\nthere's a folder in here called Shared.\n\n72\n00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,380\nNow, I don't have a user called Shared.\n\n73\n00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,800\nThere just happens to be\na folder called Shared.\n\n74\n00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,120\nThere's John Doe and Don Pezet.\n\n75\n00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,230\nIf she goes into my folder,\nshe doesn't have access to all my stuff.\n\n76\n00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,670\nShe has access to a couple of\nthe folders that we've made, but\n\n77\n00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,830\nshe doesn't have access\nto my main folders.\n\n78\n00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,760\nBut if she goes into Shared,\nit's empty, all right?\n\n79\n00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,140\nShe can jump in here and\nstart to create things.\n\n80\n00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,150\nShe can create files and\nthrow them in there.\n\n81\n00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,320\nSo for example,\nif I just fire up a text document here.\n\n82\n00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,430\nSo, here's my document, and\nI'll go ahead and save that.\n\n83\n00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,670\nAnd I'm gonna save that\ninto the Shared folder.\n\n84\n00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,840\nActually, you know what?\n\n85\n00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,690\nHere, let me just save it to my desktop\nand I'll drag it and drop it in there.\n\n86\n00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:19,121\nSo this is going to be my JaneDoe.txt or\nrtf, get my extension right.\n\n87\n00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:25,883\nAll right, so there's that document and\nI'm just gonna drag that and\n\n88\n00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:27,600\ndrop it right into there.\n\n89\n00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,098\nAnd so now, that file is right\nhere inside of Shared, all right?\n\n90\n00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:36,030\nShe had access to be able to\nwrite data into that folder,\n\n91\n00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,430\nthat Shared folder,\ninside of the Users folder.\n\n92\n00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,732\nIf I switch over to John Doe now, so I'll\nswitch over to another user on my system.\n\n93\n00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:49,880\nAll right, and once I'm in there as him,\nif I do the same thing, if I take him and\n\n94\n00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,485\nI navigate to that root folder, and\nI type it right, otherwise they\n\n95\n00:05:56,485 --> 00:06:01,360\nwill get mad at me, there we go, and I go\ninto Users, he sees the Shared folder, and\n\n96\n00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,620\nif he goes into the Shared folder,\nthere's Jane's RTF file, right?\n\n97\n00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,330\nThere's that Rich Text File she made.\n\n98\n00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,700\nAnd he can open it, right?\n\n99\n00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,370\nSo there it is.\n\n100\n00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,470\nHe can see the stuff that's inside it,\n\n101\n00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,160\nand if he tries to edit it, he gets this,\nYou don't have permission to write to it.\n\n102\n00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,180\nHe doesn't have permission.\n\n103\n00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,450\nHe's not allowed to write to it, right?\n\n104\n00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,800\nIt's been taken away or it was never\ngiven in the first place, right?\n\n105\n00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,160\nJane created it.\n\n106\n00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,780\nIt's put in here.\n\n107\n00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,870\nIt got those read permissions by default,\nright?\n\n108\n00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:33,000\nBut even if I give him write permissions\nto it, he would be able to write, but\n\n109\n00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,550\nhe still wouldn't be able to delete it.\n\n110\n00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,090\nThe file is stuck to Jane.\n\n111\n00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,180\nNow here in the GUI that's how we see it.\n\n112\n00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,950\nThat's the behavior that we expect to see.\n\n113\n00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,783\nIf I jump back over to Jane.\n\n114\n00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,390\nAnd I take a look at that file's\npermissions, right, so if I pull up\n\n115\n00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,570\nthe information for that file and I take\na look at the permissions down here.\n\n116\n00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,575\nI'm not gonna see anything too\nterribly spectacular, right?\n\n117\n00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:04,340\nJaneDoe is read and write,\nstaff is read only, everyone is read only,\n\n118\n00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,000\nthat's why JohnDoe was only able to read.\n\n119\n00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,960\nI don't see any mention of this being\nsticky or stuck, or anything like that.\n\n120\n00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,950\nAnd even if I look at the folder itself,\nthis Shared folder,\n\n121\n00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,820\nif I pull up its data and look at it,\nI can see System, Wheel, Everyone.\n\n122\n00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,900\nAnd see how everybody has read and write?\n\n123\n00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,480\nEverybody has read and\nwrite to the folder, but\n\n124\n00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,950\nwhen I created that file, it didn't\nhave the same permissions, did it?\n\n125\n00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,880\nThe permissions didn't match the folder,\nand\n\n126\n00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,180\nthat's because this folder is special,\nright?\n\n127\n00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,760\nIt's that sticky bit.\n\n128\n00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,444\nNow the easiest way to see\nthat is from the command line,\n\n129\n00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:41,672\nso let me switch back\nover to my admin account,\n\n130\n00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:44,550\nand I'll show you what it looks\nlike through the terminal.\n\n131\n00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:50,473\nAll right, so\nhere I am in my terminal, and\n\n132\n00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:55,891\nif I jump over to the Users folder and\nI look at the users, right?\n\n133\n00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:58,450\nSo there's Shared, donpezet,\njanedoe, johndoe, right?\n\n134\n00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,533\nThere's the folders I expect to see.\n\n135\n00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:06,520\nAnd if I do an ls -l, I want the long\nlisting, I can look at the permissions.\n\n136\n00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,610\nAnd as I look,\nsee how donpezet shows drwx, right?\n\n137\n00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,150\nD for directory, and then, for me as\nthe owner, I get read, write, execute.\n\n138\n00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,960\nAnd then from my group, which is staff,\nit's read and execute, and\n\n139\n00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,970\nthen for everyone else it's read and\nexecute.\n\n140\n00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,350\nThere's a little plus sign here that\nindicates that there's additional\n\n141\n00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,190\npermissions assigned to this folder\nbeyond what's displayed right there.\n\n142\n00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,220\nBut look at the shared folder.\n\n143\n00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,420\nThe shared folder has d for directory,\nthen it has read, write, execute for\n\n144\n00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,130\nthe owner, which is root.\n\n145\n00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,130\nThat's that hidden administrator account\nthat we never really see inside of Mac OS.\n\n146\n00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,610\nThen we've got read write execute for\nthe group, which is wheel.\n\n147\n00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,440\nAnd again, wheel is another administrative\ngroup that we don't normally see.\n\n148\n00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,380\nAnd then lastly for\neveryone else, there's RWT.\n\n149\n00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,950\nT?\nWhat the heck is that t?\n\n150\n00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,310\nR and w, that's read and write, but\nI normally expect to see and x, and\n\n151\n00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,654\nthe x is the executable bit.\n\n152\n00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:07,100\nWell, in this case it's a t.\n\n153\n00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,730\nAnd the t is the sticky bit.\n\n154\n00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,970\nWhen you have a folder\nthat's flagged as sticky,\n\n155\n00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,150\nit will show a t right there\nin everyone's permissions.\n\n156\n00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,570\nThat means everyone can read and\nwrite files in there.\n\n157\n00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,660\nBut, when they create a file,\nit will be stuck to them.\n\n158\n00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,720\nThey'll be the owner,\n\n159\n00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,720\nthey'll have control over it, and\nother people won't be able to delete it.\n\n160\n00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,500\nIt creates a safe,\ntemporary storage location.\n\n161\n00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,850\nThat's normally how you see\nthis used is temporary storage.\n\n162\n00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,480\nI want to share something with\nanother user temporarily.\n\n163\n00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,800\nI'll remove it later.\n\n164\n00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,571\nI throw it into this little folder for\nnow, all right.\n\n165\n00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:44,089\nSo, that's what that sticky bit is and\nthis is what it looks like.\n\n166\n00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:48,462\nNow, the sticky bit is set on\nthe folder not on the file so\n\n167\n00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:53,115\nif I go into the shared folder and\nI pull up my listing I can see\n\n168\n00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:57,720\nthe file that she created,\nthere's that JaneDoe.rtf.\n\n169\n00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,410\nAnd notice the permissions.\n\n170\n00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,660\nRead, write, read and read.\n\n171\n00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:08,430\nThere's no plus sign or a t on this one,\nbecause it doesn't have that sticky bit.\n\n172\n00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,670\nAnd even if I do like a ls -le and\n\n173\n00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,330\npull up the extended output, I can see\nthere's still no sticky bit on that.\n\n174\n00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,350\nThe sticky bit pertains to the folder.\n\n175\n00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,780\nAnd that's what's telling the computer,\nhey, when you stick a file in here\n\n176\n00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,600\ndon't just inherit the permissions\nof the folder this time.\n\n177\n00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,880\nInstead, modify it to match what we\nwould expect for sticky behavior.\n\n178\n00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,800\nAnd as we create more files, so like if I\ncreate one here, I'll do a DonPezet.txt.\n\n179\n00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,150\nRight?\n\n180\n00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,650\nSo, if I create a file and I take a look\nat that output, see how my permissions,\n\n181\n00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,260\nagain they didn't match\nthe parent folder like normal.\n\n182\n00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,270\nHere they ended up with just read for\nthe other people, read and write for me.\n\n183\n00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,844\nThe sticky bit is what does that.\n\n184\n00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:49,760\nNow, most people don't care about this.\n\n185\n00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,470\nThey've got the shared folder, the shared\nfolder works just fine for you and\n\n186\n00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,760\nthat you use.\n\n187\n00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,130\nBut, what if you wanted to create a folder\nwith this behavior somewhere else.\n\n188\n00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,690\nMaybe you had a second hard drive in\nthe computer or just another location on\n\n189\n00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,710\nthe hard drive, somewhere where you\nwanted this same behavior to be, okay.\n\n190\n00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,030\nWell, you could do that.\n\n191\n00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:17,230\nYou could go in and basically create\na sticky folder just like this one.\n\n192\n00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,000\nSo, for example, maybe every now and\nthen my users need some temporary storage.\n\n193\n00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,060\nThey need a place so\nthey can stick some data just temporarily.\n\n194\n00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,000\nMaybe we erase it every night\nat midnight or something.\n\n195\n00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,200\nSo I might choose to create a folder\non my drive called Temporary Storage.\n\n196\n00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,940\nSo, I'm gonna do that.\n\n197\n00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:41,490\nI'm just gonna make a folder called\nTemporary Storage, all right.\n\n198\n00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,280\nI'm in the root, so\nI've got to do it as a admin, so\n\n199\n00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,490\nlet me and\na little sudo to the beginning of that.\n\n200\n00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,540\nThere we go.\nOops, sorry.\n\n201\n00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,809\nLet me keep the hidden stuff hidden.\n\n202\n00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:55,508\nThere we go.\n\n203\n00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:57,886\nSo I just created this folder\ncalled Temporary Storage, and\n\n204\n00:11:57,886 --> 00:11:59,348\nlook at those default permissions.\n\n205\n00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:02,030\nRead, write, execute for me.\n\n206\n00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,280\nRead and execute for the group.\n\n207\n00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,500\nAnd then read and\nexecute for everyone else.\n\n208\n00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,980\nWell, if I want this to be a folder\nmuch like the shared folder,\n\n209\n00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,230\nI need to increase those permissions.\n\n210\n00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,930\nI need people to be able\nto write to the folder.\n\n211\n00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,020\nSo I'll need to do a little change mod.\n\n212\n00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,920\nAnd actually let me do a sudo for that.\n\n213\n00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,313\nAnd I'm gonna take the user,\nthe group, and the other and\n\n214\n00:12:25,313 --> 00:12:28,641\nI'm gonna add read, write, and execute.\n\n215\n00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:32,680\nI'm basically giving full access\nto this folder to everyone.\n\n216\n00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,320\nAnd that's for\nthe Temporary Storage folder,\n\n217\n00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,830\nso I'm just gonna grant that access so now\neverybody has full access to this folder.\n\n218\n00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,280\nAnd if I take a look at my listing again,\nI'll see that I now have that read,\n\n219\n00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,490\nwrite, execute for everyone.\n\n220\n00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,460\nNow, I just need to activate\nthe sticky bit, and\n\n221\n00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,820\nthe sticky bit will create that\ncentralized storage like we want.\n\n222\n00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,520\nNow, if you wonder why I'm doing\nthis from the command line,\n\n223\n00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,710\nit's because this is the only way.\n\n224\n00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,670\nThere's no way to set\nthe sticky bit from the GUI, so\n\n225\n00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,350\nI've got to do it from right here.\n\n226\n00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,780\nI could've set those\npermissions from the GUI.\n\n227\n00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,880\nWell, actually, I probably couldn't\ncuz it would've done read, write.\n\n228\n00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,680\nIt wouldn't have done read,\nwrite, execute.\n\n229\n00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,100\nSo even then I really wouldn't\nbe able to use the GUI for this.\n\n230\n00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,600\nAll right.\nSo now [COUGH] I just need to\n\n231\n00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,840\nadd that sticky bit.\n\n232\n00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,070\nAnd the way we do it is with\nthat same change mod command.\n\n233\n00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:31,370\nSo I'll do sudo chmod +t.\n\n234\n00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,890\nI'm adding that t bit.\n\n235\n00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,430\nRight, +t, and then the directory.\n\n236\n00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,010\nAnd then just remember that it\nonly applies to directories.\n\n237\n00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,870\nYou can't set the sticky bit on a file.\n\n238\n00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,450\nAll right.\n\n239\n00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:47,440\nOnce I've got that set, if I take a look\nat my directory listing now, here's that\n\n240\n00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,370\ntemporary storage and see how that last\nexecute bit just changed to the letter t.\n\n241\n00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,950\nThe sticky bit is now set, the other users\nwill be able to throw data in there and\n\n242\n00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,600\nit will be changed to be\nstuck to them right or\n\n243\n00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,980\nat least tied to them for their usage.\n\n244\n00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,230\nOther users will be able to read it,\nbut they won't be able to delete it,\n\n245\n00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,960\neven if we give them write\npermissions on the file.\n\n246\n00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,500\nAnd we can kind of see that in action\nif I change into that folder and\n\n247\n00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,200\njust create a file and take a look at\nthe permissions that are set on it.\n\n248\n00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,320\nI can see it right there, I've got read\nand write and then everyone else and\n\n249\n00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,400\nthe group are all getting\nread on that file.\n\n250\n00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,370\nThat's the sticky bit.\n\n251\n00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,927\nIt's already in place on your system\non that shared folder, /users/shared.\n\n252\n00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:40,360\nThat's that folder I was in earlier,\n\n253\n00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,530\nwhich was just that guy right there,\nthat's the folder.\n\n254\n00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,970\nAnd that folder is already got the sticky\nbit on it, that's how it functions.\n\n255\n00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,124\nSo if you just need a folder to\nfunction this way don't worry about\n\n256\n00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:50,878\nsetting it yourself.\n\n257\n00:14:50,878 --> 00:14:52,656\nJust go and throw your data there.\n\n258\n00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:53,191\nDone.\n\n259\n00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:55,640\nThat's what it's there for.\n\n260\n00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,650\nBut if you want to create your own\nfolder that does the same thing,\n\n261\n00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,720\nthat's how you do it.\n\n262\n00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,460\nYou do that chmod+t and\nthen the name of the directory.\n\n263\n00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,450\nAnd that is the sticky the bit.\n\n264\n00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,980\nIt's not as terribly exciting as you\nmight think something is, but it is.\n\n265\n00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,700\nAnd that folder, I gave that\nfolder permissions of read, write,\n\n266\n00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,350\nexecute, read, write, execute,\nread, write, execute.\n\n267\n00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,010\nRight?\nI gave everybody full control.\n\n268\n00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,700\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n269\n00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,290\nI could have given it to\nwhere the group had read and\n\n270\n00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,690\nwrite, but everyone just had read.\n\n271\n00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,410\nMaybe I want other people in my group\nto be able to throw files in there and\n\n272\n00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,870\nhave the files stuck to them.\n\n273\n00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,920\nBut I don't want just everybody to do it.\n\n274\n00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,010\nSo don't think that I had to do read,\nwrite, execute on that folder.\n\n275\n00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,950\nI did, just because I wanted it\nto be like the shared folder, but\n\n276\n00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,070\nI could've modified that if I wanted.\n\n277\n00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:50,854\nSo for example, if I do a chmod,\nand we'll take the other,\n\n278\n00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:56,573\nand we'll remove write\nfrom temporary storage.\n\n279\n00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:57,259\nOkay.\n\n280\n00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:00,520\nAnd if I take a look at\nwhat that looks like.\n\n281\n00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,612\nNow, when I look at it,\nsee how the sticky bit is still set.\n\n282\n00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:05,430\nAll right.\n\n283\n00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,030\nSo, everyone has read and\nthe sticky bit is still set.\n\n284\n00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,800\nThe group still has read and write.\n\n285\n00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,240\nSo now, when the group writes things, when\nanybody in that group writes something,\n\n286\n00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,980\nit'll be stuck to them,\neveryone else will just be able to read.\n\n287\n00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,000\nSo, you can mess around with\nthose permissions a good bit.\n\n288\n00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,626\nAll right, well,\nthat's about all I have on the sticky bit.\n\n289\n00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:32,370\nThe next thing that I wanna cover is a\nsomething that hopefully you don't have to\n\n290\n00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,950\ndeal with, but\nin reality is something you probably will.\n\n291\n00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,720\nOccasionally permissions on your system\ncan get messed up, they can get damaged.\n\n292\n00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,360\nAll right.\n\n293\n00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,030\nIf we go through and\nstart changing permissions ourselves, or\n\n294\n00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,080\nwe're installing packages in your software\nthat goes in and modifies permissions, or\n\n295\n00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,900\nmaybe we've just had some\nimproper shutdowns and reboots.\n\n296\n00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,770\nThese are all different\nthings that could lead to\n\n297\n00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,490\npermissions becoming damaged\non your hard drive, right.\n\n298\n00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,410\nSome of the most common causes,\ndeleting user accounts.\n\n299\n00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,610\nIf you delete a user and they've secured\nfiles somewhere else on the hard drive,\n\n300\n00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,480\nyou might lose access to them.\n\n301\n00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,240\nPutting your laptop in target mode.\n\n302\n00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,790\nWhen you put your laptop\nin target mode and\n\n303\n00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,620\nhook it up to another computer, it's\nalways possible for that other computer to\n\n304\n00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,320\nchange permissions on your drive,\nwhich can really mess things up.\n\n305\n00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,510\nSo, there's a number of different ways\nthat the permissions on your drive\n\n306\n00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,710\ncan become damaged.\n\n307\n00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,580\nAll right.\n\n308\n00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,240\nWell, fortunately there's a couple of\ndifferent ways that we can repair that.\n\n309\n00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,890\nI made a comment in another episode,\nI said you can never\n\n310\n00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,570\ntruly lock an administrator out\nof something on your system.\n\n311\n00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,080\nSo for example,\nif I take a file, and I make it\n\n312\n00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,860\nwhere I'm the only one who can read it,\nand everybody else has no permissions.\n\n313\n00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,440\nAn administrator can still come along and\noverride those permissions.\n\n314\n00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,510\nThey can override it and\nset them however they want.\n\n315\n00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,700\nThat's the privilege of\nbeing an administrator.\n\n316\n00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,820\nWhen you use that Sudo command,\nyou can override anything.\n\n317\n00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,860\nBut if something happens where\nthe administrator gets locked out or\n\n318\n00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,590\nis maliciously locked out, the\nadministrator has a couple of different\n\n319\n00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,060\ntools they can use to get around it.\n\n320\n00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,110\nThe first tool,\nis centering around the whole hard drive.\n\n321\n00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:10,050\nIf you wanna scan your entire hard\ndrive for bad permissions and fix them,\n\n322\n00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,580\none of the easiest ways to do\nthat is with the disc utility.\n\n323\n00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,860\nWe can fire up the disk utility.\n\n324\n00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,990\nAnd it's got a neat little section in\nthere where you can verify permissions to\n\n325\n00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,190\nmake sure they're correct.\n\n326\n00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,410\nAnd if they aren't,\nyou can repair the permissions.\n\n327\n00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,630\nSo, let me show you this.\n\n328\n00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,040\nThe nice thing about the disk\nutility is it's available\n\n329\n00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,120\nin the operating system\nif you're booted up.\n\n330\n00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,880\nBut if you can't even boot up, you can\nalways boot to recovery and you've got\n\n331\n00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,980\naccess to the disk utility in recovery\nalso, so you can jump into it either way.\n\n332\n00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,350\nWhen you're in disk utility you\njust pick your hard drive and\n\n333\n00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,440\nnot the hard drive itself but\nthe volume in the hard drive and\n\n334\n00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,550\nif it's like mine they\nmight have the same name.\n\n335\n00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,760\nThey might have different names like,\nhere, let me pull it up on my\n\n336\n00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,070\nactual desktop, that's a virtual\nmachine we were looking at there.\n\n337\n00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,300\nBut here, on my actual desktop\nyou can see my apple SSD\n\n338\n00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,040\nis the name of the hard drive.\n\n339\n00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,880\nBut the volume is what I want, and\nthis one's called Macintosh HD.\n\n340\n00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,870\nNow, when you're looking\nat the actual volume,\n\n341\n00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,380\nyou'll see these two\nlittle buttons light up.\n\n342\n00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,480\nAnd they're not lit up when you\nchoose the main drive itself.\n\n343\n00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,260\nRight?\nBecause\n\n344\n00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,570\nthe physical hard drive\ndoesn't have permissions.\n\n345\n00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,280\nPermissions are a function of the volume.\n\n346\n00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,690\nAnd so if I choose the volume,\nI'll see these lit up.\n\n347\n00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:26,870\nNow, that's assuming that mine is\nformatted Mac OS extended journaled.\n\n348\n00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,510\nAll right?\n\n349\n00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,380\nIf I formatted it like FAT32,\nfor example, or exFAT.\n\n350\n00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,970\nThey don't have file permissions and so\nagain, these buttons won't be lit up.\n\n351\n00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:40,160\nBut in my case, it's extended journal,\nI can scan it and look for problems.\n\n352\n00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,070\nIf you hit verify disc permissions,\nit's gonna look at the disc and\n\n353\n00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,390\nsee if it can spot anything wrong.\n\n354\n00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,550\nNow it does take a moment while it runs\nand in fact, mine did find an error.\n\n355\n00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:54,100\nLooks like we've got an SUID file and\nit's warning me that it's been modified.\n\n356\n00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,610\nSo that's not necessarily a great thing.\n\n357\n00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,370\nIt says it will not be repaired.\n\n358\n00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:02,720\nAn SUID file, if you're not familiar with\nthat, normally when you run a program,\n\n359\n00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,430\nthe program runs as you,\nas your user account, all right?\n\n360\n00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,850\nIf you need to run it as\njust an administrator,\n\n361\n00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,880\nyou can use things like Sudo like\nI've been doing in this show\n\n362\n00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,850\nto run the program as an administrator.\n\n363\n00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,710\nSUID is a special flag we\ncan set on a file, and\n\n364\n00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,560\nit says no matter who runs this file,\nrun it as an administrator.\n\n365\n00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,290\nAnd that's kind of a dangerous thing,\n\n366\n00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,510\nyou don't normally want that set on\nfiles unless you absolutely need it.\n\n367\n00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,030\nSo you might see it on drivers,\nor whatever.\n\n368\n00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,470\nAnd if you look at mine this\nSUID file I can see right here\n\n369\n00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,260\nit's actually my Apple\nremote desktop agent.\n\n370\n00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,340\nAnd that is something you\nwant to run as administrator.\n\n371\n00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,420\nSo that's expected.\n\n372\n00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,550\nThat's software that Apple\nhas modified for me.\n\n373\n00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,170\nSo that's a warning I can ignore.\n\n374\n00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,040\nBut as I look at some of these other ones.\n\n375\n00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,255\nPermissions differ on this\nparticular printer's P-list.\n\n376\n00:20:49,255 --> 00:20:50,124\nAll right.\n\n377\n00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:53,120\nSo my printers preference\nfile has a problem.\n\n378\n00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,940\nAnd it's saying the permissions\naren't what they should be.\n\n379\n00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,140\nThey should be read and\nwrite for everybody.\n\n380\n00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,000\nInstead it's just read and\nwrite just for me.\n\n381\n00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,760\nWell, I only have one user account on my\nlaptop so I don't really care about that.\n\n382\n00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,000\nIt's a problem, but it hasn't affected me.\n\n383\n00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,200\nBut if I add a second user.\n\n384\n00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,320\nThe second user won't be able to write\nto the installed printer's P-list,\n\n385\n00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,430\nthat means they won't be able to\nadd printers and that's a problem.\n\n386\n00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,510\nThe problem hasn't manifested itself,\nyet, but it is there, it does exist.\n\n387\n00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,740\nAnd you'll see some of these other\npermissions that have jumped up.\n\n388\n00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,090\nSomething about aliases, send mail,\ncouple of different things online.\n\n389\n00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,110\nThat its apparently unhappy with.\n\n390\n00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,700\nAll right.\n\n391\n00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,650\nSo it spotted those and I can fix them.\n\n392\n00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,700\nI can hit repair disk permissions and\nit's gonna fix it.\n\n393\n00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,330\nAll right.\n\n394\n00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,350\nSo it can take a long time to\nscan your drive sometimes.\n\n395\n00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,890\nMine went pretty quick there.\n\n396\n00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,500\nIt can take a long time to repair it,\n\n397\n00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,340\ndepending on the amount of\nissues it has to correct.\n\n398\n00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,500\nMine just has a couple of issues.\n\n399\n00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,590\nIt will fix them.\n\n400\n00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,740\nPretty quickly, right?\n\n401\n00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,460\nSame thing here.\n\n402\n00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,010\nIf I were do it inside\nof my virtual machine.\n\n403\n00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,480\nYou just verify the permissions.\n\n404\n00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,620\nThis one's a clean install, so\n\n405\n00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,040\nI can't imagine there's anything\ndamaged in it, but you'd be surprised.\n\n406\n00:21:57,138 --> 00:22:02,050\nNow a disc utility, you can do this while\nthe system is on, or we can reboot,\n\n407\n00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:07,130\ngo into recovery, and\ndo it from recovery, right?\n\n408\n00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:07,865\nEither one works.\n\n409\n00:22:07,865 --> 00:22:09,679\nThe other thing is once I\nknow what the mistakes are,\n\n410\n00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,276\nit told me what the mistakes were,\nI could have just gone to the terminal and\n\n411\n00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:14,440\nused CH-mod, and gone and\nfixed those permissions myself.\n\n412\n00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,100\nIt's a lot easier to just hit the repair\nbutton, right, and let it do that.\n\n413\n00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,560\nBut I could have chosen to fix it myself.\n\n414\n00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,870\nAll right, now these tools work great and\n\n415\n00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,020\nthey assume that your system\nis somewhat functional.\n\n416\n00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,030\nObviously it has some problems but\nyou're still able to log in or\n\n417\n00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,650\nat least get to disk utility.\n\n418\n00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,000\nBut that's not always the case.\n\n419\n00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,520\nSometimes, things are bad\nin a different way, right?\n\n420\n00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,430\nMaybe you're completely locked\nout of your home directory.\n\n421\n00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:44,960\nYour operating system works fine, you're\nable to get into the system, but just your\n\n422\n00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,750\nhome directory has bad permissions, and\nit's not picking it up for some reason.\n\n423\n00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,280\nWe see this really commonly if you delete\na user and then recreate the user,\n\n424\n00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,600\nthe permissions are always\nwhacked out when that happens.\n\n425\n00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,840\nSo, if you're gonna go through that,\n\n426\n00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,300\nthere's actually another utility that\nI want to show you that you can use.\n\n427\n00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,830\nIt's usually what I consider\nmy last ditch effort,\n\n428\n00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,300\none of the last things I do before\nI just go to a time machine backup.\n\n429\n00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,740\nIt's only available from recovery,\n\n430\n00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,730\nand it's actually built into\nthe password reset function in recovery.\n\n431\n00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,440\nSo I wanna show you guys that, but\n\n432\n00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,882\nthat means I need to reboot\nmy laptop into recovery.\n\n433\n00:23:17,882 --> 00:23:20,740\nAnd when I reboot it makes my\nscreen go black for a little while.\n\n434\n00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,250\nSo why don't we do this,\nwhy don't we stop and take a break?\n\n435\n00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,150\nAnd during the break I'll reboot\nmy laptop into recovery and\n\n436\n00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,340\nI'll show you the other way that we can\nreset passwords on our home directory.\n\n437\n00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,170\nIt's petty neat, and it works pretty well.\n\n438\n00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,201\nSo stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n439\n00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:41,081\n[MUSIC]\n\n440\n00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:42,555\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n441\n00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:47,530\nSo during the I rebooted my laptop and\nI'm now officially in the Apple recovery.\n\n442\n00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,765\nNow, Apple doesn't let you change the DPI\nscaling when you're in recovery, so\n\n443\n00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:54,017\nI apologize in advance for the small font.\n\n444\n00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:57,226\nBut when we boot into recovery,\nwe've got our normal utilities,\n\n445\n00:23:57,226 --> 00:23:58,558\nthings like Disk Utility.\n\n446\n00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:00,710\nIf I wanna go and\ndo my permissions repairs,\n\n447\n00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,968\nI can jump right into Disk Utility and\ndo the Verify Permissions and\n\n448\n00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:07,250\nRepair Permissions,\njust like we saw before the break.\n\n449\n00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,020\nAll right?\n\n450\n00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,110\nBut if I'm just focusing on\nthe permissions of my home directory.\n\n451\n00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,590\nRight?\nSo just my home directory.\n\n452\n00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,700\nI just need to fix those.\n\n453\n00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,980\nOr another user's home directory,\nfor that matter.\n\n454\n00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,210\nThere's a neat little\nutility that's in here, and\n\n455\n00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,730\nit's part of the password reset process.\n\n456\n00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,670\nThen the password reset doesn't show\nup as an option here in recovery,\n\n457\n00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,410\nat least doesn't normally.\n\n458\n00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,600\nIf we go up on our utilities here,\nyou'll see Firmware Password Utility, but\n\n459\n00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,730\nthat's not the one I want, either.\n\n460\n00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,980\nThe utility that I want actually\nis not displayed at all.\n\n461\n00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,880\nBut that's okay because we can\nget to it through the terminal.\n\n462\n00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,840\nI'm going to fire up the terminal.\n\n463\n00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,940\nAnd I will make this bigger\nbecause that is just microscopic.\n\n464\n00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,510\nAlright so here's my terminal.\n\n465\n00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:50,520\nAnd what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to run resetpassword.\n\n466\n00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,280\nThis is the same utility you would use\nif somebody forgot their password.\n\n467\n00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,470\nSo you get a call from Jane Doe,\nwhere she forgot her password so\n\n468\n00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,890\nyou go in and reset it, right?\n\n469\n00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,000\nSo we say reset password.\n\n470\n00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,750\nThat's going to launch a little GUI\nutility, or it will eventually.\n\n471\n00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,050\nI guess it's going to try\nmy patience this morning.\n\n472\n00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,530\nIt's going to launch it in the background.\n\n473\n00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,390\nThere we go.\n\n474\n00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,120\nThat's [LAUGH] the utility\nthat I'm looking for.\n\n475\n00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,040\nSo it's going to launch\nthe password reset utility and\n\n476\n00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:21,090\nwith this one, you pick your hard\ndrive that Mac OS is installed on.\n\n477\n00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,930\nYou pick the user that you want to reset,\nso I could pick Don Pezet, and\n\n478\n00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,230\nyou put in what their new\npassword is going to be.\n\n479\n00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,940\nThat's how you would\nreset a user's password.\n\n480\n00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,870\nBut there's a neat little button\nthat a lot of people never notice.\n\n481\n00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,120\nBecause usually you come in\nhere to reset a password.\n\n482\n00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,560\nBut right down here at the bottom of\nthe screen, in really tiny text, it says,\n\n483\n00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,440\nreset home folder permissions and ACL's.\n\n484\n00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,930\nIt can take a look at\nthat user's home folder.\n\n485\n00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,690\nWhatever user you pick\nhere in this dropdown box.\n\n486\n00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:54,500\nAnd it can reset their home folder\nto have the permissions that it\n\n487\n00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,330\nwould've had by default when\nMAC OS was originally installed.\n\n488\n00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,210\nSo if you deleted a user and\n\n489\n00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,260\nrecreated them and their old user\nhome folder was still there,\n\n490\n00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,660\nthey're not going to have access to that\nfolder because their user ID has changed.\n\n491\n00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,690\nThis will let us reset that and\nfix the problem.\n\n492\n00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,950\nOr if they've just been messing\naround with their permissions and\n\n493\n00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,220\ngot themselves locked out, if they\ninstalled some software that locked them\n\n494\n00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,150\nout of some folder in their own drive,\nthis is a quick and easy way to do that.\n\n495\n00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,580\nYou pick the user from the list, and\nyou don't have to punch in a password,\n\n496\n00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,190\ncuz we're not necessarily\nresetting their password.\n\n497\n00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,990\nYou pick the user and then you hit that\nreset button, and it runs really fast.\n\n498\n00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:38,230\nThis does not take long to reset, and\nnow the home folder permissions and\n\n499\n00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,170\naccess control list have all been\nreset back to a default state.\n\n500\n00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,190\nAll right.\n\n501\n00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,980\nQuick, easy way to do that.\n\n502\n00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,170\nThat's the reset password utility.\n\n503\n00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,300\nEasy to jump into and fire it up.\n\n504\n00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,980\nIf you're resetting\nsomebody else's password,\n\n505\n00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,190\nyou can actually do this while\nthe system is online, not in recovery.\n\n506\n00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,130\nBut if it's your own directory\nyou're trying to recover,\n\n507\n00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,480\nrecovery is your only option.\n\n508\n00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,350\nBecause you can't get into\nyour own data to do this.\n\n509\n00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,130\nSo you'd have to boot into recovery and\nrun it from there.\n\n510\n00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,250\nAll right.\n\n511\n00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,370\nSo easy enough to do, knocks it out, and\n\n512\n00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,270\nnow those permissions are back to normal\nand we can just boot back into our system.\n\n513\n00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,960\nSo for the exam, remember there's three\nways that we can fix permissions.\n\n514\n00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,910\nSo we've got the chmod command.\n\n515\n00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,420\nYou just drop to terminal and\nfix it yourself.\n\n516\n00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,150\nThere's the disk utility.\n\n517\n00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,030\nYou can run verify permissions and\nthen repair permissions.\n\n518\n00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,870\nThat will scan the entire hard drive.\n\n519\n00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,650\nAnd then there's the reset\npassword utility\n\n520\n00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,910\nwhich lets you reset\nan individual user's home folder.\n\n521\n00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,030\nThree different ways,\nI'm going to hold up four fingers,\n\n522\n00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,720\nthree different ways to go in and\nrepair those permissions.\n\n523\n00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,290\nAll right, well,\nlet me reboot my computer.\n\n524\n00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,070\nI do have one other thing that we\nneed to tackle in this show but\n\n525\n00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,540\nI need to get back into my full OS.\n\n526\n00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,320\nNow, while that's rebooting, all\nthe permissions that we've talked about\n\n527\n00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,950\nin the first part of this series and\nthen in this episode\n\n528\n00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,350\nhave all centered around permissions\non my actual hard drive.\n\n529\n00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,220\nBut in today's world, it's really really\ncommon that we deal with removable media.\n\n530\n00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,520\nWe have USB hard drives,\nThunderbolt hard drives, USB flash and\n\n531\n00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,690\nthumb drives like these that we\nmove from computer to computer.\n\n532\n00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,440\nWell, the permissions that are assigned,\nwhen I ran some of those commands\n\n533\n00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,220\nlike ls-l to get the long\nlisting in the terminal.\n\n534\n00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,680\nWhen I saw those,\nthose are all showing me names.\n\n535\n00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,180\nLike a name, Don Pezet.\n\n536\n00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,510\nBut in the background,\nthat's not what UNIX sees.\n\n537\n00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,610\nThat's not what the BSD\nunderneath Mac OS sees.\n\n538\n00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,280\nWhat it's seeing is instead what's\ncalled a user ID, a number.\n\n539\n00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,410\nEvery user has a UID and\nthat's what it's tracking on the files.\n\n540\n00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,270\nIf I'm UID 510 and\n\n541\n00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:56,040\nI write some files to this USB drive\nas UID 510 and I unplug this key and\n\n542\n00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,790\nI go to another computer and I plug\nit in there and there is no user 510.\n\n543\n00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,090\nWhat's gonna happen?\n\n544\n00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,850\nWell, it doesn't know who\nthe owner of the file is.\n\n545\n00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,800\nIt doesn't know who has access.\n\n546\n00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,890\nBest case scenario, nobody will\nget access, worst case scenario,\n\n547\n00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:13,920\neveryone will get access to my stuff,\nand that's a problem, right.\n\n548\n00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,240\nWe've gotta be careful\nwith removable media.\n\n549\n00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,970\nThe other risk is what if there is\na user 510 on the other system.\n\n550\n00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,820\nWhat if I'm user 510 here?\n\n551\n00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,520\nBut on another computer,\nJane Doe is user 510.\n\n552\n00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,590\nNow she's the owner of the files\non this USB key when it's plugged\n\n553\n00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,900\ninto that computer, and I'm the owner\nwhen it's plugged into this computer.\n\n554\n00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,700\nThat's a real problem.\n\n555\n00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,890\nUnfortunately, there's not\na good way to solve that.\n\n556\n00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,030\nWell, there is.\n\n557\n00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,320\nThe best way to solve it is to\ndeploy a directory service.\n\n558\n00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,020\nIf you have a directory service\nlike OpenLDAP or Active Directory,\n\n559\n00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,250\nthose guys, Open directory, all of them.\n\n560\n00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,510\nIf you have a directory service,\nthe main function of that\n\n561\n00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,520\nis to centralize your user accounts,\nso that if I'm user 510,\n\n562\n00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,530\nI can log in to 300 different computers,\non all those computers, I'm user 510.\n\n563\n00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:05,880\nAnd now when I take that USB key and move\nfrom computer to computer to computer,\n\n564\n00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,380\nit knows 510 on a file here matches 510,\nme, and I'm the owner, right?\n\n565\n00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,330\nSo it's able to track that.\n\n566\n00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:19,320\nIf you don't have a directory service\nthough, then that doesn't work, and so\n\n567\n00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,940\nby default Apple does not\ntrack ownership on USB keys,\n\n568\n00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,160\nall right, on removable media in general.\n\n569\n00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,240\nIn fact, they don't even track\nit on secondary hard drives.\n\n570\n00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,465\nIf you add a second internal hard drive.\n\n571\n00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:34,955\nLike if you have a Mac Pro, and\n\n572\n00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:39,765\nyou add a second hard drive to it, it\nwon't track ownership on those, all right?\n\n573\n00:30:39,765 --> 00:30:42,615\nAnd it's doing it because of that risk.\n\n574\n00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:46,505\nIf you move it to another system, it's not\ngonna know who the owner is anyway, and\n\n575\n00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:47,865\ninappropriate access might be given out.\n\n576\n00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:51,735\nSo instead it treats them\nas public shared disks.\n\n577\n00:30:51,735 --> 00:30:56,480\nSo when you're dealing with a USB key,\nunderstand that it's not secure.\n\n578\n00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,830\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n579\n00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,240\nI'm going to take this USB key here.\n\n580\n00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,880\nThis is one that I got for\nfree from my bank.\n\n581\n00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,130\nYou know, it's funny, a lot of companies\nthese days are trying to stay edgy and\n\n582\n00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,300\nhip and so\nthey give you things like USB keys.\n\n583\n00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:16,310\nBut then you look at it and it's 500 megs\nand you can't store one photo on it.\n\n584\n00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,470\nBut I just do it on here.\n\n585\n00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,100\nI'm going to format this thing just to\nmake sure that we're looking at the honest\n\n586\n00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,610\ndefault MAC view.\n\n587\n00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:27,890\nSo I'm going to take this USB stick and\nI'm just going to, we'll erase the thing.\n\n588\n00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:32,370\nWe'll do MAC OS extended journaled and\nwe'll erase that one.\n\n589\n00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,110\nAll right.\n\n590\n00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,730\nSo I've got a brand new\nformatted USB key here,\n\n591\n00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,210\njust straight from the factory,\nand oh, that's not good.\n\n592\n00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,510\nCouldn't unmount the disk.\n\n593\n00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,320\nWell, isn't that a shame?\n\n594\n00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,710\nLet's try that again.\n\n595\n00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,800\nSee, this is what I get for\nusing a free USB,\n\n596\n00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,015\nI should have probably used one of my\nnicer ones that I've got on my desk.\n\n597\n00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,919\nWe will try that one more time.\n\n598\n00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:00,974\nThere it goes.\n\n599\n00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:04,360\nSo it's gonna format it and so now I know\nI'll have those default permissions.\n\n600\n00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,960\nNow once that's thrown on there,\nthe data's there, right?\n\n601\n00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,591\nIt's formatting which is apparently\ntaking forever, what is this USB 1.1?\n\n602\n00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:16,423\nI'm gonna end up regretting\nusing this disk.\n\n603\n00:32:16,423 --> 00:32:18,530\nBut, [LAUGH] there it goes.\n\n604\n00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,430\nOnce it's done it's created,\nthe volume has been formatted, and\n\n605\n00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,000\npermissions have been set on it.\n\n606\n00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,100\nIf I start to create things, like here,\nlet me just create a quick file.\n\n607\n00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,470\nSo, I will just create\nthis is a quick file,\n\n608\n00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,380\nand I'm going to save that\nover onto my USB key.\n\n609\n00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,490\nAll right, so this is gonna be\nQuick File.rtf, and we'll save that.\n\n610\n00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,470\nAll right, so now I've got this quick\nlittle file that I save on there,\n\n611\n00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,220\nlet's take a look at what\nthe permissions end up.\n\n612\n00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,690\nIf I open up that USB stick,\nI can see Quick File right there,\n\n613\n00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:04,320\nand if I pull up its information\nI can look at its output, and\n\n614\n00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,520\nlet me just shrink some\nof this stuff down.\n\n615\n00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,530\nIt's expanded everything.\n\n616\n00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:12,550\nAnd if I get in the permissions I can see\nDeep Pezet, me, I can read and write.\n\n617\n00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,530\nI can see staff is read only,\neveryone is read only.\n\n618\n00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,310\nPermissions are set just like they\nwould be on my normal hard drive.\n\n619\n00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,000\nThat's what we normally expect.\n\n620\n00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,810\nSo that doesn't look any different but\n\n621\n00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:28,660\nwhat it's not showing us here is that\nit's not actually tracking that owner.\n\n622\n00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,590\nAnd if I were to pull up the information\nfor the USB drive itself,\n\n623\n00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,340\nI would see something interesting.\n\n624\n00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,774\nWhen I pull up the USB drive itself,\nI see Deep Pezet has read and write,\n\n625\n00:33:38,774 --> 00:33:41,420\nstaff has read and write,\neveryone else is read only.\n\n626\n00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,450\nI see those default permissions.\n\n627\n00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,210\nBut notice in gray text on\nthe gray background this\n\n628\n00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,330\nlittle information right here,\nyou can barely see it.\n\n629\n00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:53,970\nIt says, ignore ownership on this volume,\nall right.\n\n630\n00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:57,950\nAnd what that means is that\nMac OS knows there's an owner,\n\n631\n00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,900\nthere is an owner set, it's me, Don Pezet.\n\n632\n00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,760\nI'm the one who formatted it,\nbut It's gonna ignore that.\n\n633\n00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,260\nIt's gonna ignore that and\ntreat everybody as the owner.\n\n634\n00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,650\nEverybody can go in here and override\npermissions and take over this disk,\n\n635\n00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,220\nor format it, or do whatever it is\nthat they wanna do with that disc.\n\n636\n00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,260\nBecause it's removable,\n\n637\n00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,560\nbecause it can't verify that you\nare actually the owner, right.\n\n638\n00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,910\nIf you're only going to be using this disk\n\n639\n00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,680\ninside of a directory environment where\nyou know that you'll have that same owner\n\n640\n00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,050\nacross all the different computers,\nyou can turn that option off.\n\n641\n00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:35,550\nAnd then it will respect the owner flag,\nbut\n\n642\n00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,740\nit'll only respect the owner\nflag on your computers.\n\n643\n00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,290\nIf somebody were steal that USB key and\n\n644\n00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:43,040\nplug it into their own computer\nthat's not on the directory.\n\n645\n00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,150\nWell, that's going to\nbasically ignore ownership,\n\n646\n00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,820\nthat's their option they've set.\n\n647\n00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,760\nSo, it's not something we can rely on.\n\n648\n00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,690\nAnd that is on by default.\n\n649\n00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,900\nI didn't turn that on, you guys saw me\nformat that right here during the show.\n\n650\n00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,150\nIt did it and it set that option.\n\n651\n00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,350\nAnd if we wanna turn it off, you have to\nunlock, you have to be an administrator.\n\n652\n00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,630\nSo I'll unlock that, and\nnow I can turn that option off.\n\n653\n00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,350\nAnd now the owner's going to be respected.\n\n654\n00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,840\nAnd see what it just did?\n\n655\n00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,780\nIt says I can only read because\nthe owner just became system.\n\n656\n00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,390\nNow the system owns that\ndisk because that's what was\n\n657\n00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,910\nactually happening in\nthe background before.\n\n658\n00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:22,910\nSure, it was lying to me and\ntelling me that I was the owner.\n\n659\n00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,250\nBut I really wasn't.\n\n660\n00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,160\nIn the background it was\nthe system that was the owner.\n\n661\n00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,960\nAnd when I turned that option off,\nI can see that.\n\n662\n00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,500\nI can see that I wasn't\nactually the owner.\n\n663\n00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,680\nAnd so\nnow I'll have to seize control of that.\n\n664\n00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,360\nI'll have to use C-H-O-W-N.\n\n665\n00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,040\nThe change owner command to\nseize ownership of that disk,\n\n666\n00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,480\nassign it back to me, and\ngo and set those permissions.\n\n667\n00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,340\nBe very aware of that, because what\nit basically boils down to is you\n\n668\n00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,810\ncannot trust permissions\non removable media.\n\n669\n00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,930\nThat is not a way to\nsecure removable media.\n\n670\n00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,950\nIf you want to secure your removable\nmedia, it's gonna need to be encrypted or\n\n671\n00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,290\nsecured through some other mechanism.\n\n672\n00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,280\nYou can't trust file permissions for that.\n\n673\n00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,800\nAnd in this case,\nit's Mac OS extended journal.\n\n674\n00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,350\nI have it formatted that way so\nI have full support for permissions and\n\n675\n00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,360\nthings like that.\n\n676\n00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,320\nIf I had formatted it with\na different file system, like,\n\n677\n00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,670\nif I take that USB stick and\nformat it, let's go exFAT, oops.\n\n678\n00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,420\nHere we go.\n\n679\n00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,950\nSo I'm gonna format it exFAT.\n\n680\n00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,880\nExFAT's a great file system cuz we\ncan move in between Windows and\n\n681\n00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,040\nMAC really easy.\n\n682\n00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,900\nIt's compatible with all of them.\n\n683\n00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,660\nSo if I go ahead and do that.\n\n684\n00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,770\nWe'll just give it a quick\nformat over to that.\n\n685\n00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:35,250\nExFAT doesn't support file permissions.\n\n686\n00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,470\nSo now, if I start copying data into it,\n\n687\n00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,310\nthere's not gonna be any\npermissions on it at all, right?\n\n688\n00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,650\nAnd so that's got its own little issues.\n\n689\n00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,340\nSo if I fire up text edit and\ncreate another document,\n\n690\n00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:54,580\na smarter me would've saved\nthe other one somewhere else, but\n\n691\n00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,550\nI'll go ahead and just save this one\nright here out on the USB stick.\n\n692\n00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,790\nI can use it just fine.\n\n693\n00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,890\nBut if I browse into the USB stick and\nI take that document and\n\n694\n00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:09,660\nI pull up its information, notice under\nsharing and permission, it's empty.\n\n695\n00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,320\nIt just says you can read and\nwrite and that's it.\n\n696\n00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,470\nThere's no permissions being\ntracked on that file at all.\n\n697\n00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:19,868\nAnd if I pull up the USB drive,\npull up its information.\n\n698\n00:37:19,868 --> 00:37:22,760\nUnder Sharing & Permission,\nyou can read and write.\n\n699\n00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,530\nAnd that's it.\n\n700\n00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,470\nNo permissions tracked at all.\n\n701\n00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,940\nIf it's an NTFS drive, it's read-only.\n\n702\n00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,380\nIf it's exFAT, you can read and\nwrite, but there's no permissions.\n\n703\n00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,280\nOnly with Mac OS journal do we actually\nget the full permission set, and\n\n704\n00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,260\neven that's not really functional when\nyou move from computer to computer.\n\n705\n00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,110\nSo real important stuff to be aware of.\n\n706\n00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,490\nJust something to keep in mind.\n\n707\n00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,340\nAnd it is something that\nturns up on the exam.\n\n708\n00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,440\nAll right, so that's about it for\nremovable media.\n\n709\n00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,090\nWas there anything else I\nwanted to mention on there?\n\n710\n00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,420\nNo, I believe that's it.\n\n711\n00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,790\nI know I called out in another show how\nwe have to be careful that when you\n\n712\n00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:02,680\nadd removable media to a system,\nif you're using fast user switching,\n\n713\n00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,270\nthe other users that login would have\naccess to that removal media, too.\n\n714\n00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,020\nAnd that all ties back to this\nignoring ownership thing.\n\n715\n00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,770\nThis is the cause of that problem.\n\n716\n00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:15,430\nSo if you watched an earlier show where\nI talked about fast user switching,\n\n717\n00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:19,340\nthis is what caused that problem that I\nwas talking about in the other episode.\n\n718\n00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,140\nSo, it all kind of ties together.\n\n719\n00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,760\nAll links back to the original stuff.\n\n720\n00:38:24,142 --> 00:38:26,680\nAll right but that's about it for\nfile permission, so\n\n721\n00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,390\nI think this is probably a good place for\nus to stop.\n\n722\n00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,690\nLet me remind you guys,\n\n723\n00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,940\nif you have questions on any of this,\nplease feel free to ask.\n\n724\n00:38:33,940 -->

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening, and\n\n5\n00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:39,250\nwelcome back to another episode of\nITProTV, I'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,200\nBack again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n7\n00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,150\nWe're gonna be diving\ninto a neat area today.\n\n8\n00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,280\nWe're gonna take a look at managing files.\n\n9\n00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,970\nAnd no, I'm not gonna bore to death\nwith how to copy, cut, and paste.\n\n10\n00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,130\nI think we all probably\nhave that by this point.\n\n11\n00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,680\nBut there's some neat functionality in the\nbackground that Mac OS can do that allows\n\n12\n00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,840\nus to handle files in a special way.\n\n13\n00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,760\nAnd so we're gonna run through\nsome of those technologies.\n\n14\n00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,090\nThese are not just ones that\nshow up on the exam, but\n\n15\n00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,190\nalso ones that you'll use in real life,\nall right?\n\n16\n00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,140\nI wanna start off with cloning or\nlinking files, all right?\n\n17\n00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,970\nThere are times when you want to\nhave a file more than one place\n\n18\n00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,710\non your hard drive, but you don't want\nto have more than one copy of the file.\n\n19\n00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,000\nLet me give you an example.\n\n20\n00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,720\nSo I like to keep all of my\ndocuments nice and organized.\n\n21\n00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,880\nSo I have a folder structure that\nall of my documents are in and\n\n22\n00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,040\neverything is kind of placed\naway deep down in these folders.\n\n23\n00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,370\nWell the problem is if I need a file,\n\n24\n00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,080\nI know exactly where it is\nbecause of my structure.\n\n25\n00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,410\nBut I might have to browse five folders\ndeep to get to the file that I want and\n\n26\n00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,040\nthat can be a little frustrating.\n\n27\n00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,360\nSo if I've got a file that I\nknow I'm working with every day,\n\n28\n00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,160\nI might want to have it right\nthere on my desktop, in MacOS,\n\n29\n00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,330\nright where I can get to it immediately,\nwithout having to navigate through all\n\n30\n00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,320\nthis deep folder structure\nto get to where I'm going.\n\n31\n00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,480\nWell, I could just copy the file, but\n\n32\n00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,260\nthe problem with copying a file\nis that now I have two files.\n\n33\n00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,130\nIf you modify one,\nthe other doesn't get modified.\n\n34\n00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,630\nOr if you modify the other one,\nyour link doesn't get modified, right?\n\n35\n00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,730\nSo it's two separate files.\n\n36\n00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,900\nIt's also taking up twice as much space,\nright?\n\n37\n00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,260\nYou duplicated that file.\n\n38\n00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,060\nSo it's eating up twice\nthe hard drive space.\n\n39\n00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,320\nSo that's not necessarily\nthe greatest way to do it.\n\n40\n00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,330\nWell, in Mac OS,\nwe can actually do what are called links.\n\n41\n00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,860\nAnd a link is where you have what\nlooks like a copy of the file, but\n\n42\n00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,970\nit's actually just a pointer\nback to the original file.\n\n43\n00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,250\nAnd there's a few\ndifferent ways to do links.\n\n44\n00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,700\nThere's actually three main\nways we can do links, and for\n\n45\n00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,080\nthe exam you need to be familiar\nwith all three, all right?\n\n46\n00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,600\nLet's start with the one that\nmost people are familiar with but\n\n47\n00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,370\nis also the one that Apple\ndoesn't want you to use.\n\n48\n00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,300\nIn Mac OS, for a long time, we've had\nwhat's called the make alias feature.\n\n49\n00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,310\nYou can take any file and\nyou can make an alias of it.\n\n50\n00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,600\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n51\n00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,080\nLet me just go to My Documents folder, and\n\n52\n00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,818\nI've got a document in here,\nthis PDF, that I use all the time.\n\n53\n00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:04,430\nIt's a Cisco\\g routing book and I\nliterally use this book almost every day.\n\n54\n00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,840\nAnd I can right click on that and\nI can choose Make Alias.\n\n55\n00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,450\nYes, it's right there in my context menu.\n\n56\n00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,190\nWhen I make a alias,\nit creates this alias of a file and\n\n57\n00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,690\nI can move that to my desktop.\n\n58\n00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,600\nSo, now I've got that\nalias sitting right here.\n\n59\n00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,580\nIt stuck the word alias on the end, maybe\nI don't like that, so I can move that.\n\n60\n00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,180\nAnd now I've gotten an alias.\n\n61\n00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,560\nNow, notice how it has\na little arrow on the file.\n\n62\n00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,910\nThat arrow is what's letting me\nknow this is not a real file.\n\n63\n00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,210\nThis is not the real PDF.\n\n64\n00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,570\nIt's just a link to a PDF\nsitting somewhere else, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,430\nThat PDF if I double click on it,\nit's gonna open it up.\n\n66\n00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,512\nThere it is, I'm in that PDF.\n\n67\n00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:47,282\nAll right, so\nI'm able to get into it, great.\n\n68\n00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:51,680\nAll right, I don't necessarily know that\nit's actually in my documents folder or\n\n69\n00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,430\nnested ten folders deep\non a separate hard drive.\n\n70\n00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,008\nI don't see that, it's hidden from me and\nI've got this alias right here.\n\n71\n00:03:57,008 --> 00:04:04,210\nAll right, now, this alias function has\nbeen present in Mac OS for a long time.\n\n72\n00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,820\nIt was present even back in\nthe Power PC days, before the BSD\n\n73\n00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,450\nsubstructure was put in, back in OS 9 and\nOS 8, we had this functionality.\n\n74\n00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:19,450\nWell now with BSD under the hood,\nwe can use the Unix linking structure and\n\n75\n00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,810\nthat's what they'd rather\nyou used in Mac OS.\n\n76\n00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,660\nThe problem is they haven't\nreally given us a GUI to do that.\n\n77\n00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,780\nSo from the graphical user interface, this\nis the way aliases work right here and\n\n78\n00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,350\nthat's basically it, right?\n\n79\n00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,490\nSo this is what most users\nare gonna make use of.\n\n80\n00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,410\nBut as an administrator,\n\n81\n00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,020\nApple encourages you to use some\nof the other methods instead.\n\n82\n00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,330\nThe main problem with this type of\nalias is that the alias is itself,\n\n83\n00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,870\njust kind of a pointer, but\nonly Mac OS recognizes it.\n\n84\n00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,770\nSo, if you drop to the BSD terminal and\n\n85\n00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,980\nyou try and\nuse these links they don't work.\n\n86\n00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,720\nThey only work in the Mac OS GUI, so\n\n87\n00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,210\nthey're kind of limited\nin their functionality.\n\n88\n00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:05,250\nIf we do links through BSD though,\nthey work just fine in the GUI and\n\n89\n00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,150\nthey work from terminal, and that means\nthat other software can use them too and\n\n90\n00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,390\nmake use of that link.\n\n91\n00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,240\nOtherwise, we have this one which is\nreally just limited to the finder, right.\n\n92\n00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,140\nNow, the link that I created, that alias,\n\n93\n00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,060\nlet's take a look at that from\nthe perspective of the terminal.\n\n94\n00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,690\nOkay, so here I am in the terminal.\n\n95\n00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,890\nAnd if I get into my desktop, and I take\na look, I'm just gonna do a quick ls.\n\n96\n00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,870\nI can see my Routing-Bits Handbook.pdf\nright there.\n\n97\n00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,810\nIt shows up just like a normal file.\n\n98\n00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,090\nIt's showing up at about 300K in size,\n300 kilobytes.\n\n99\n00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,640\nNow that's pretty big for\njust a link, isn't it?\n\n100\n00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:50,378\nWell, let's look at what\nthe actual file would be.\n\n101\n00:05:50,378 --> 00:05:54,120\nAnd oh,\nI need to get into the right folder.\n\n102\n00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,650\nThere we go.\n\n103\n00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,650\nSo the actual file was 2.9 megabytes,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,300\nSo the file itself stored in my\ndocuments folder is 2.9 megabytes.\n\n105\n00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,140\nThis one's only 300k.\n\n106\n00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,410\nThat's considerably smaller\nthan the actual file.\n\n107\n00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,330\nSo at least I get that benefit, all right?\n\n108\n00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,150\nSo it did make the file smaller,\nall right?\n\n109\n00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,860\nBut, let's try this with something\na little bit different here.\n\n110\n00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,750\nLet's take another file that\nI've got in my documents folder.\n\n111\n00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,360\nInside of my documents folder,\nI've got like a little text file.\n\n112\n00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,320\nLet me see if I can find that.\n\n113\n00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,780\nI think I have like a router\nconfiguration back up.\n\n114\n00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,300\nHere we go, this guy.\n\n115\n00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,740\nI'm gonna make an alias of this one.\n\n116\n00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,730\nIt's just a text file.\n\n117\n00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,590\nAnd I'll drag that and\nstick it onto my desktop also.\n\n118\n00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,140\nAnd I'll just get rid of that\nkind of alias tag on the end.\n\n119\n00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,660\nThere we go, all right.\n\n120\n00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,500\nSo now I've got this text\nfile sitting here and\n\n121\n00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,730\nif I open that up,\nI can see the text file.\n\n122\n00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,200\nHere it is, this is that router\nconfiguration that I had backed up and\n\n123\n00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,270\nI can see its data.\n\n124\n00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,910\nIt's all there, all right?\n\n125\n00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,010\nWell, that is a link just like\nthe routing bit's PDF is.\n\n126\n00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,470\nSo those are both aliases and\nthey both have the little arrow on them.\n\n127\n00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,350\nFrom the terminal if I\ntake a look at those,\n\n128\n00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,128\nthey just show up as regular files, right?\n\n129\n00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:09,420\nNotice that br1.txt file is 260k, it's\na little bit smaller than the other one,\n\n130\n00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,220\nmostly because the file name is shorter.\n\n131\n00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,470\nIt's the file name that's really making\nthat link file the size that it is.\n\n132\n00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,130\nSo the file name is smaller,\nthat makes the link file smaller.\n\n133\n00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,290\nNow if I were to try and\nedit that file, if I were to use vi or\n\n134\n00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:30,010\none of the command line editors to try and\nedit that file, the alias, see what I get?\n\n135\n00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,820\nI get a bunch of mess, right?\n\n136\n00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,050\nJust a jumbled mess in here.\n\n137\n00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,690\nAnd you can sort of read some of it.\n\n138\n00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,860\nI see my name.\n\n139\n00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,900\nI see documents.\n\n140\n00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,770\nI see br1.\n\n141\n00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,180\nThat's that path,\nthat's pointing to how to get to it.\n\n142\n00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,540\nBut I see just a bunch of junk, all right?\n\n143\n00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,720\nVersus, if I were to edit the actual file.\n\n144\n00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,750\nHere, I can see it just fine.\n\n145\n00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,698\nI can see it, I can edit it,\nI can work with it.\n\n146\n00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:57,252\nThat's showing how those links\nthat we make, those aliases,\n\n147\n00:07:57,252 --> 00:08:00,482\nreally only work in the finder,\nthey only work in the GY.\n\n148\n00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:04,256\nIf I start using other terminal type\nsoftware it doesn't work, right.\n\n149\n00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:06,980\nMost end users don't care about that.\n\n150\n00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,580\nMost end users don't use terminal,\nthey don't have that need, right.\n\n151\n00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,190\nSo it's not such a big deal,\nyou don't mess with it.\n\n152\n00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,130\nBut, the functionality is there,\nit's easy to use and it's available.\n\n153\n00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,121\nBut what about the other methods?\n\n154\n00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:23,744\nWell, there's two other methods using Unix\ntechnologies that I could do these links\n\n155\n00:08:23,744 --> 00:08:25,620\nwith also, all right.\n\n156\n00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,160\nThere's something called a symbolic link\nand there's something called a hard link.\n\n157\n00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,800\nSymbolic links and hard links are special\ntypes of links that have been available in\n\n158\n00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,840\nUnix since, probably the 80s or late 70s,\nreally been around for a long time.\n\n159\n00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,950\nBut they're somewhat new to Apple\nbecause Apple didn't always have\n\n160\n00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,260\nBSD under the hood, right, it used\nto be their own proprietary system.\n\n161\n00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,140\nSo now we can use those links just like\nwe would in a Linux environment, right.\n\n162\n00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,420\nLet's start with a symbolic link.\n\n163\n00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,260\nA symbolic link works just like the link\nwe just saw, just like an alias.\n\n164\n00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,490\nBasically, it's a link that says here's\na file, but this isn't the actual file,\n\n165\n00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,780\ninstead it's just a pointer to\nthe file somewhere else, all right.\n\n166\n00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,730\nAnd it's symbolic.\n\n167\n00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,500\nThis is not the file itself,\nthis is just a link.\n\n168\n00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,162\nSo, let me take these two.\n\n169\n00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:16,010\nI'm gonna delete these aliases\nthat I made a moment ago, so\n\n170\n00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,370\nI'll just throw them in the trash.\n\n171\n00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,530\nAnd remember, when you delete an alias,\nthat doesn't delete the original files,\n\n172\n00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,140\nthey're still there.\n\n173\n00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:28,500\nBut now I can jump in and I can create\nmy own links using symbolic links.\n\n174\n00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,660\nWhen I create a symbolic link\nthe command syntax is pretty easy,\n\n175\n00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,090\nit can get a little confusing.\n\n176\n00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,160\nBasically, we use the ln command,\nln is what we use to create a link.\n\n177\n00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,800\nAnd we use -s to create a symbolic link.\n\n178\n00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,790\nI'm gonna talk about hard links next.\n\n179\n00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,140\nHard links are the default.\n\n180\n00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,560\nAnd so you would just say ln for\na hard link, but for\n\n181\n00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,665\na symbolic link we say, ln -s.\n\n182\n00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,470\nAnd then, we specify the target.\n\n183\n00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,090\nSo, what's the file we're linking to?\n\n184\n00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:04,590\nI'm gonna link to my Routing-Bits PDF,\nso I'm gonna point to that.\n\n185\n00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,430\nAnd then I need to tell it\nthe name of the link I'm making.\n\n186\n00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,760\nAnd I wanna put a link right\nhere on the desktop, and\n\n187\n00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,790\nI just wanna call it the same thing.\n\n188\n00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,137\nSo I'll call this my\nRouting-Bits-HandBook.pdf,\n\n189\n00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:19,930\nall right, just giving it that same name.\n\n190\n00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:25,173\nSo it was, ln, for link, -s,\nI told it I wanted a symbolic link,\n\n191\n00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:31,680\nand then I told it the name of the file\nI'm linking to, this is my target.\n\n192\n00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,940\nAnd then I told it the name of\nthe link I want to make, right,\n\n193\n00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,391\nthe shortcut that I'm gonna be making.\n\n194\n00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,580\nWhen I run that it creates a link and\nlook what just appeared on my desktop.\n\n195\n00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,280\nThere's that PDF, okay.\n\n196\n00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,000\nIt's got a little arrow on it just\nlike the make alias function inside of\n\n197\n00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,820\nMac OS, right.\n\n198\n00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,730\nIt really looks the same.\n\n199\n00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:55,218\nLet me add another link for\nthe little router config that I had,\n\n200\n00:10:55,218 --> 00:10:58,567\nwhich was BR1.text.\n\n201\n00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:05,560\nAnd I'm gonna link that here on my\ndesktop as BR1.text, all right.\n\n202\n00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,060\nSo I'll create a link for that one too and\nthere I get those links appearing also.\n\n203\n00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,830\nSo if I drag these up here, I've got them.\n\n204\n00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,630\nThey don't look any different than\nthe aliases that I made inside\n\n205\n00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,050\na Mac OS earlier.\n\n206\n00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,370\nIf I double click on that PDF\nit opens it up, there's my PDF.\n\n207\n00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,630\nAll right.\n\n208\n00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,410\nIf I open up that text file it\nopens up and there it is, right, so\n\n209\n00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,700\neverything that I need.\n\n210\n00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,630\nThe difference here is that UNIX,\nthe underlying BSD system here,\n\n211\n00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,830\nwill recognize that difference.\n\n212\n00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,750\nIf I take a look on my desktop,\nwhen I looked earlier, when I did ls's,\n\n213\n00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,236\nwhen I pulled up those lists,\nI saw they looked just like regular files.\n\n214\n00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:45,744\nThere's BR1.txt,\nthe Routing-Bits handbook PDF,\n\n215\n00:11:45,744 --> 00:11:48,380\nthose just show up like normal documents.\n\n216\n00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,830\nBut, now that I've made the change,\nnotice how they show up, right.\n\n217\n00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,560\nLet me make this a little bit wider.\n\n218\n00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,880\nAnd what you can see is that\nthe underlying terminal now knows that\n\n219\n00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,535\nthey're a link.\n\n220\n00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:03,933\nBR1.txt and Routing-Bits handbook.pdf,\n\n221\n00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:07,310\nthey show in pink,\nwhich means they're a link.\n\n222\n00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,970\nAnd it shows me what they're linked to,\nwhere they actually point to.\n\n223\n00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,400\nAnd the difference there being if\nI were to edit the link, right, so\n\n224\n00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,360\nif I were to actually edit that\nBR1.txt file, I'm in there, right?\n\n225\n00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,520\nWhen we make an alias,\n\n226\n00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,830\nit's actually creating an alias file that\ncontains information on how to get there.\n\n227\n00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,410\nBut when you do a symbolic link,\nit's a file system entry,\n\n228\n00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,030\nnot a file itself that's\npointing to that destination.\n\n229\n00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:43,315\nAnd that file system entry,\nif I get back out here,\n\n230\n00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:48,355\nwhen we look at our listing,\nthe file system entry, look at its size.\n\n231\n00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:52,639\nRemember that the alias file\nwas 300 kilobytes right.\n\n232\n00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,805\nOne of them was 300 kilobytes the other\none was like 267 kilobytes, right.\n\n233\n00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:02,335\nThese are 20 bits,\nit's not even one kilobyte.\n\n234\n00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:08,400\nIt's just a bit or byte, sorry, so\nthis one's 20 bytes and 38 bytes, right.\n\n235\n00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,490\nThese are super small.\n\n236\n00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,290\nIt's just a link,\n\n237\n00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,840\nit's just a pointer that says,\nhere's how you can get to that location.\n\n238\n00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,830\nSo pretty neat stuff there.\n\n239\n00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,150\nBut there is a little bit\nof a problem with this.\n\n240\n00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,090\nWhat if I move the original file?\n\n241\n00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,520\nOne of the nice things\nabout Make Alias is,\n\n242\n00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,230\nif you start moving the files,\nit tracks that.\n\n243\n00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,040\nIt keeps track of that, and\nit knows you moved the original and\n\n244\n00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,590\nit repoints it automatically.\n\n245\n00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,610\nWith a symbolic link like this,\nthat doesn't happen.\n\n246\n00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,730\nIf we move the original\nfiles from their location,\n\n247\n00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,130\nmove them somewhere else, these links\nbreak, and they don't work anymore.\n\n248\n00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,500\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n249\n00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,530\nIf I go in here to my Finder, and\nI'll go into my Documents folder and\n\n250\n00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:56,520\nI'll take the original BR1.txt and\nI'm just gonna rename it.\n\n251\n00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,040\nMaybe I'll stick .old on the end, right.\n\n252\n00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,520\nSo now that file name is different,\nthat's the one that I pointed to.\n\n253\n00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,610\nWell, when I go back to terminal and\n\n254\n00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,760\nlook at my list, see how it's\nstill pointing to br1.txt, right?\n\n255\n00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,310\nIt's not pointing to\nthe right place anymore, and\n\n256\n00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,170\nif I try and edit that file, it's empty.\n\n257\n00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,990\nIt lost track of the original.\n\n258\n00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,860\nAnd that was one of the biggest\nadvantages of the Make Alias command\n\n259\n00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,110\nwas when you made an alias,\nit would track the original.\n\n260\n00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,810\nIf you move the original or renamed the\noriginal, Mac OS would update that alias,\n\n261\n00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,080\nand so\nit always reflected the destination.\n\n262\n00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,640\nAnd that's why that link file was so big.\n\n263\n00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,250\nIt had the path in there, but then it had\na hash, like a digital hash of the file.\n\n264\n00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,490\nSo if it ever moved,\nit'd be able to find it again, and\n\n265\n00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,890\nthat was all stored in that alias.\n\n266\n00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,000\nSo, symbolic links are great,\nthey work well, but\n\n267\n00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,640\nthey don't survive movement or renaming\nof the original file, that's a problem.\n\n268\n00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,310\nSo, instead,\nwe can use what's called a hard link.\n\n269\n00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,820\nA hard link is where we don't actually\nlink to the destination of the file, like\n\n270\n00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:11,230\nwhere the other file's located, instead we\npoint to the raw data on the hard drive.\n\n271\n00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,860\nSo now we have, basically like two\ncopies of the data, in a sense.\n\n272\n00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,430\nThere's only one copy of the actual data,\nbut there's two pointers that go to it.\n\n273\n00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,129\nWhen you create a file on your hard drive,\nyou're actually creating a hard link.\n\n274\n00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,809\nWhen that file is created,\nright here this BR1.txt.old,\n\n275\n00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:32,800\nright, or here let met get rid\nof the old there BR1.txt, right.\n\n276\n00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,595\nThere's a pointer on the hard drive that\nsays there's a file that exists called\n\n277\n00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:38,040\nBR1.txt.\n\n278\n00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,800\nAnd here's the locations on the hard\ndrive where its data is stored, right.\n\n279\n00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,520\nThat's created and that's a hard link.\n\n280\n00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,118\nWe don't see it,\nwe just see that the file exists but\n\n281\n00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:48,082\nit actually does create one hard link.\n\n282\n00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:53,042\nEvery single file on your entire hard\ndrive has one hard link, at a minimum,\n\n283\n00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:56,233\none hard link,\nthat indicates the file exists.\n\n284\n00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:58,949\nWith hard links all we do is we add more.\n\n285\n00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:01,650\nWe can add additional hard links\nthat point to the same data.\n\n286\n00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,340\nAnd the cool part is if we ever move\nthat data we change it's name or\n\n287\n00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,280\nwhatever the hard link will persist.\n\n288\n00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,060\nIt'll survive.\n\n289\n00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,820\nAnd we'll still have that mapping.\n\n290\n00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,010\nAll right, let me show you that.\n\n291\n00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,410\nI'm gonna go ahead and delete these\nlinks that I put on the desktop.\n\n292\n00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,200\nSo these guys right here, I'll just\ngo ahead and toss them in the trash.\n\n293\n00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,670\nAll right, and\n\n294\n00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,950\ndeleting symbolic link doesn't\nactually remove the originals, right?\n\n295\n00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,390\nI can see in my Documents folder I\nstill have BR1.txt and Routing Bits, so\n\n296\n00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,350\nthey're still there.\n\n297\n00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,860\nBut this time, I'm going to go in and\ncreate those links again,\n\n298\n00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,080\nand I'm going to leave off the dash S.\n\n299\n00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,250\nIf you leave off the dash S,\ninstead of creating a symbolic link,\n\n300\n00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,730\nit will create a hard link all right.\n\n301\n00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,530\nThat hard link that doesn't just\npoint to a particular path but\n\n302\n00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:52,450\npoints to sectors on the hard drive\nwhere it can actually get that data and\n\n303\n00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,430\nI need to create one for this guy too.\n\n304\n00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,580\nSo I'm just deleting the dash s from\nthe command that I did a few moments ago.\n\n305\n00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:07,050\nNow looking at my desktop I can\nsee I've got these two files.\n\n306\n00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,720\nBut look at the icons now.\n\n307\n00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,840\nAll right.\n\n308\n00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,620\nThere's no arrow on them.\n\n309\n00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,900\nWhen you create a hard link, the operating\nsystem treats it as a real file.\n\n310\n00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,210\nIt's not a link anymore.\n\n311\n00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,930\nIt's actually linked to the data on\nthe hard drive, so there's no arrow.\n\n312\n00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,730\nThat's not a shortcut anymore.\n\n313\n00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,530\nThat's the actual file.\n\n314\n00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:29,540\nBut the actual file is now\nmapped to more than one place.\n\n315\n00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,700\nIt's mapped to my desktop folder and\nit's mapped to my documents folder.\n\n316\n00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:41,600\nAnd if I go into my shell and let me just\npull up my documents folder, all right.\n\n317\n00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,490\nHere in my documents folder I can find\nthe Routing Bits Handbook right there,\n\n318\n00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,000\njust showing up as a PDF.\n\n319\n00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,689\nAnd I can find br1.txt, right?\n\n320\n00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,780\nSo again, just showing up as a text file.\n\n321\n00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,980\nNothing special there, right?\n\n322\n00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,560\nIt got orange coloring\ncuz it's a text file.\n\n323\n00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,450\nBut otherwise, it's just there.\n\n324\n00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,510\nAll right?\n\n325\n00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:05,820\nIf I take a look at my current directory,\ndesktop, there's that text file.\n\n326\n00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,960\nAnd there's Routing Bits.\n\n327\n00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,510\nAnd there's nothing to\nindicate that they're links.\n\n328\n00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,040\nIt doesn't show that they're hard links.\n\n329\n00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,290\nAs far as the operating system is\nconcerned, that's the real file.\n\n330\n00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,150\nThere's a couple of\nneat things about this.\n\n331\n00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,180\nIf I move the original file, or\n\n332\n00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,855\neven if I delete the original file\noutright, I can delete the original file.\n\n333\n00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,545\nThese hard links stay and\n\n334\n00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:31,105\nthey still work, because you use\nthem basically as the real file.\n\n335\n00:18:31,105 --> 00:18:37,335\nSo, when I'm here in the terminal, if I go\nto edit, BR1.txt, I see that real file,\n\n336\n00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:43,165\nand if I start messing around\nwith the originals, right?\n\n337\n00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,450\nLet's go to the originals here.\n\n338\n00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,290\nAnd I'll go into my Documents.\n\n339\n00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,270\nI'll take my Routing Bits Handbook and\nI will, I'm just going to delete it.\n\n340\n00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,370\nSo I'll just move it to the Trash.\n\n341\n00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,080\nI'll take my BR1.txt, and\nI'm going to change its name.\n\n342\n00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,320\nI'm going to call it BR8.txt, all right?\n\n343\n00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,650\nSo I just messed with my originals,\nI deleted one, I renamed the other.\n\n344\n00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:09,640\nWell, on my desktop,\nI still see that BR1 dot text.\n\n345\n00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,800\nMy PDF disappeared, oh did my shoot my\nlink might not have properly created.\n\n346\n00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,930\nI didn't check to make sure that my\nsymbolic link disappeared first [LAUGH] so\n\n347\n00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,450\nlet me just verify that, shoot it.\n\n348\n00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,460\nIt got rid of that one on me.\n\n349\n00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,110\nSo I forgot about something.\n\n350\n00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,880\nThe way I've got my drive set up.\n\n351\n00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,462\nSo I deleted that one.\n\n352\n00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,390\n[LAUGH] So\n\n353\n00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,680\nit did actually delete both of them cuz\nthey were linked to that same location.\n\n354\n00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:41,110\nBut you can see where br1.txt is still\nin existence because of that hard link.\n\n355\n00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,470\nEven though the original's been renamed.\n\n356\n00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,455\nAnd if I edit that one.\n\n357\n00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:46,590\nBR1.txt.\n\n358\n00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,700\nI see the data.\n\n359\n00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,330\nRight?\n\n360\n00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,250\nThe file is renamed BR8, but\nI don't care about that.\n\n361\n00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,090\nI'm linking to that\nsame data on the drive.\n\n362\n00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,170\nThe reason I lost my PDF is that\nwhen I moved it to the recycle bin,\n\n363\n00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:05,180\nthat was Mac OS getting involved and doing\nsome of their secure delete technology.\n\n364\n00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,470\nIf I had deleted it from the terminal\nthat wouldn't have happened.\n\n365\n00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,510\nSo it's Mac OS being\na little more secure for me.\n\n366\n00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,450\nAnd I could still recover\nthat from my recycle bin.\n\n367\n00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,220\nIf I go in here and take it.\n\n368\n00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,450\nLooks like I've got more than one of that.\n\n369\n00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,360\nOh shoot, I've got my links,\nand my original.\n\n370\n00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,240\nLet me restore the original.\n\n371\n00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,580\nIf I take one of these and\nI put it back to where ever it came from.\n\n372\n00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,830\nI guess I would have to remember\nwhich one of these I grabbed,\n\n373\n00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,800\nI'm going to assume that it's this one.\n\n374\n00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,490\nWhen I put it back the link will be gone,\nI'll have to relink it,\n\n375\n00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,000\nbecause it's no longer linked\nbecause it went into the recycle\n\n376\n00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,400\nbin, but I can always jump back in and\ndo that.\n\n377\n00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,660\nIf I go into my Documents folder I'll\nfind that Routing Bits Handbook.\n\n378\n00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,570\nAnd there it is.\n\n379\n00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,870\nThat's the one I just restored.\n\n380\n00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,440\nNow I'm getting confused.\n\n381\n00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,300\nAnd now I've got them linked\nall sorts of different ways.\n\n382\n00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,310\nLet me just make sure I'm\nnot confusing my files here.\n\n383\n00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,900\nThere we go.\nAll right, so\n\n384\n00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,850\nI've got my Routing Book Bits Handbook\nput back into my documents folder and\n\n385\n00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,210\nlet's just recreate that link.\n\n386\n00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:09,440\nI want to make sure that actually\nworked the way that I intended it to.\n\n387\n00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,940\nWhere am I?\n\n388\n00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,600\nAll right.\n\n389\n00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,050\nSo I'm going to rebuild that link.\n\n390\n00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,430\nThere we go, and\nI'm going to link that right here to my\n\n391\n00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,150\ndesktop with the same name.\n\n392\n00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,620\nThere we go.\n\n393\n00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,620\nAll right, so\nI've got it linked back again.\n\n394\n00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,760\nIt's in place and it's ready to rock.\n\n395\n00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,250\nNow instead of deleting because I\ndon't want Mac OS's secure to kick in.\n\n396\n00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,810\nIf I were to move it, right.\n\n397\n00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:43,580\nSo let's go into my Documents and\nfind old Routing Bits Handbook, and\n\n398\n00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,560\nI'm gonna move it somewhere else.\n\n399\n00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,520\nSo maybe I want to move it\ninto my Downloads folder.\n\n400\n00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,570\nSo I'll just move that over\ninto Downloads, and so\n\n401\n00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,820\nit's moved from it's original location.\n\n402\n00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,440\nWell, if I look on my desktop,\nit's still there.\n\n403\n00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,580\nAnd if I launch it, it still works.\n\n404\n00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,950\nIt survived that move because the original\ndata is still there on the drive.\n\n405\n00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,520\nIt hasn't been flagged as deleted or\nknocked out.\n\n406\n00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,590\nIt survived that move, all right?\n\n407\n00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,500\nSo what we've just seen are three\ndifferent ways to link files\n\n408\n00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,220\nwhich one should we use?\n\n409\n00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,230\nWell each one has different\ncharacteristics that make it worth\n\n410\n00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,910\nwhile, all right.\n\n411\n00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,530\nMake alias, that's the easiest.\n\n412\n00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,190\nIt's supported in the GUI\nthe end users can do it and\n\n413\n00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,190\nit will be perfectly good for them.\n\n414\n00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,540\nBut, it really is only\nfunctional in the GUI.\n\n415\n00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,710\nIt doesn't work in terminal or\ncommand shells or whatever.\n\n416\n00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,200\nThey're not gonna follow those links.\n\n417\n00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,850\nAnd so, Apple doesn't recommend using that\nunless you're just doing end user stuff.\n\n418\n00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,270\nAs an administrator, that leaves the other\ntwo, symbolic links and hard links.\n\n419\n00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,310\nSymbolic links were nice, cuz they\nwere just pointers to another path.\n\n420\n00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,120\nThey were very small, easy to do,\nthe command line recognized them, so\n\n421\n00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,370\nthey work well there.\n\n422\n00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:58,690\nThey did show up as aliases they don't\nsurvive moving or renaming the original.\n\n423\n00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,990\nRight?\nSo that's kind of a limit\n\n424\n00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,820\nof symbolic links.\n\n425\n00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,750\nHard links, on the other hand,\nthey pointed to the original file,\n\n426\n00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,410\nthey did survive renaming or\nmoving the original.\n\n427\n00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,480\nThe secure delete killed\nthe deletion part.\n\n428\n00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,470\nThe moving and\nthe renaming they survived, right?\n\n429\n00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,130\nSo, we get a good hard link there.\n\n430\n00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,830\nBut they don't show up as aliases, so\nthat can be a little bit confusing.\n\n431\n00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,720\nAnother thing to remember,\nis that you can do symbolic links for\n\n432\n00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,960\ndirectories, you can't do hard links for\ndirectories.\n\n433\n00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,570\nThere is actually a way to do it,\nbut it is not good.\n\n434\n00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,920\nWhen you do a hard link, you're\npointing to the data on the hard drive.\n\n435\n00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,000\nRight, you're saying here's\nthis file that exists,\n\n436\n00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,820\nand here's where its data\nis on the hard drive.\n\n437\n00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,860\nWhat data does the directory have?\n\n438\n00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,910\nIt doesn't have any.\n\n439\n00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,020\nThere's not anything to\npoint to on the hard drive.\n\n440\n00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,550\nA directory just has an entry in your\nfile system table, and that's it.\n\n441\n00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,990\nSo, there's no need to do a hard link,\nto a directory.\n\n442\n00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,510\nAnd so, that support's not there.\n\n443\n00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,060\nHard links are for files.\n\n444\n00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,902\nSymbolic links are for\nfiles and directories, right?\n\n445\n00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:59,173\nYou might want to have a shortcut to\na particular directory right there on your\n\n446\n00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:01,504\ndesktop, and\nyou can do a symbolic link to point to it.\n\n447\n00:24:01,504 --> 00:24:05,713\nSo, three different types of\naliases that are available and\n\n448\n00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:08,877\nthose are kind of the scenarios for\neach one.\n\n449\n00:24:08,877 --> 00:24:13,570\nAll right, we had a question in\nthe chatroom over here about the Apple\n\n450\n00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,960\nrecommendation that we do not\nrecommend the use of aliases.\n\n451\n00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,720\nSo, what they did,\nas Terry in the chatroom asked,\n\n452\n00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,330\nwhat they did is they flagged what\nis called a deprecated feature.\n\n453\n00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:30,120\nA deprecated feature means that they\nhaven't removed it yet, it's still fully\n\n454\n00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,990\nsupported by the system and odds are it\nwill be supported the next version, right?\n\n455\n00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,750\nBut, it is going away eventually.\n\n456\n00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,560\nSo eventually they are going to\nremove make alias all right.\n\n457\n00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,922\nNow what will more than likely\nreally happen, is down the road,\n\n458\n00:24:42,922 --> 00:24:46,979\nthey'll change that make alias to use\nsymbolic links or hard links instead.\n\n459\n00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:47,748\nRight.\nBut for\n\n460\n00:24:47,748 --> 00:24:50,898\nright now they just flagged it that way\nsaying it will go away in the future,\n\n461\n00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:51,407\nall right.\n\n462\n00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,990\nBut it isn't gone now,\nyou can still use it.\n\n463\n00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,574\nAll right.\n\n464\n00:24:54,574 --> 00:24:59,211\nSo, after that, what they're trying to\ndo is rely on the functions of the file\n\n465\n00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:01,128\nsystem that are underneath it.\n\n466\n00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:01,870\nRight.\n\n467\n00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,880\nThings that BSD already support,\nthose hard links and symbolic links,\n\n468\n00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,530\nuse those because they're part of the core\nOS, those are gonna be around forever.\n\n469\n00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,960\nBut because they don't exactly mirror\nthe functionality of make alias.\n\n470\n00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,040\nThey keep make alias around.\n\n471\n00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,960\nA hard link gives us\nthe survivability of moving and\n\n472\n00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,770\nrenaming the original, but\nit doesn't show up as an alias.\n\n473\n00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,080\nIt shows up as an original, and\nthat's confusing to the end user.\n\n474\n00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,740\nA symbolic link shows up as an alias, so\n\n475\n00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,290\nit's not confusing, but it doesn't\nsurvive moving and renaming the original.\n\n476\n00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,940\nMake alias does both.\n\n477\n00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,190\nIt does both of those.\n\n478\n00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,910\nBut it's proprietary, and\nit's just functional in the GUI.\n\n479\n00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:45,110\nSo no one linking technology\nprovides the perfect scenario.\n\n480\n00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,120\nSo Terry asked,\nwhen did they announce deprecation?\n\n481\n00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,810\nI don't actually know.\n\n482\n00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,470\nI don't know the official\ndate they announced that.\n\n483\n00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,400\nI just know that if you crack\nopen any Apple textbook,\n\n484\n00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,680\nit's got it in there every time.\n\n485\n00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,740\nIt says make aliases as\na deprecated feature.\n\n486\n00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,180\nI don't know the actual date on that one.\n\n487\n00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:09,060\nAll right, so for the exam,\nall three are fair game.\n\n488\n00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,240\nAll right, you'll see all three of\nthose types of aliases present,\n\n489\n00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,830\nso be aware of those,\nbe aware of how they function.\n\n490\n00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,030\nMake aliases the easiest, you can just\nControl+Click on an item, and choose make\n\n491\n00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:23,070\nalias, or I believe it's command L,\nis the other one for making an alias.\n\n492\n00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,700\nYou've also got he ln command from\nthe command line and it's just ln for\n\n493\n00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,220\na hard link, ln-s for a symbolic link.\n\n494\n00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,570\nAnd then you specify the target and then\nthe name of the link that you're creating.\n\n495\n00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,590\nSo the commands aren't\ntoo terribly difficult.\n\n496\n00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:42,580\nYour average end user is not going\ndo hard and symbolic points.\n\n497\n00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,680\nWell, that's about it for links.\n\n498\n00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,410\nI've also got a lot more on file metadata\nand a few other things we need to talk\n\n499\n00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,870\nabout but I'm a little short\non time on this segment.\n\n500\n00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,540\nSo let's stop here and take a break.\n\n501\n00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,840\nAnd when we get back,\nwe're gonna jump into metadata and\n\n502\n00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,360\nsome additional file settings\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n503\n00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,230\nStay tuned.\n\n504\n00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,843\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n505\n00:27:01,843 --> 00:27:06,823\n[SOUND].\n\n506\n00:27:06,823 --> 00:27:09,120\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n507\n00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,842\nSo when we store files on the hard drive.\n\n508\n00:27:11,842 --> 00:27:13,560\nVery early, we saw we can do links,\n\n509\n00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,200\nspecial pointers that tell\nus where the files are.\n\n510\n00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,400\nThere's actually a lot of other stuff\nyou can do with the files, too.\n\n511\n00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,860\nOne of the really powerful features we\nhave inside of MAC OS is the ability to\n\n512\n00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,480\nhave file metadata,\n\n513\n00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,110\nwhich is additional file data explaining\nexactly what that file is for,\n\n514\n00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:35,460\nwhat it's contents are, what it can be\nused for and so on, really good stuff.\n\n515\n00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,880\nThink about it in terms of pictures,\nright?\n\n516\n00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,260\nFor years people would take pictures, and\n\n517\n00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,350\nthen you would have to remember,\nwhere was I when I took that picture?\n\n518\n00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,570\nWhat year was that?\n\n519\n00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,780\nWhen did that happen?\n\n520\n00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,480\nRight?\n\n521\n00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,690\nAnd then when the developers started\ngetting kind of caught wind of that they\n\n522\n00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,450\nsaid we'll start printing the dates\non the back of those pictures and\n\n523\n00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,330\nwhen we develop the pictures,\nwe'll write the dates on them.\n\n524\n00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:55,950\nRight?\n\n525\n00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,750\nWell when we went all digital\nthat became a lot easier.\n\n526\n00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,500\nNow your digital photographs\nhave metadata attached to them.\n\n527\n00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,570\nAdditional information that explains\nmore information about that photograph.\n\n528\n00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,210\nRight?\n\n529\n00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,350\nWhere it was taken.\n\n530\n00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,220\nWhat date it was taken on.\n\n531\n00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,080\nOther information like that you\ngeotag it and all that good stuff.\n\n532\n00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,260\nAll embedded right there in the image,\nright?\n\n533\n00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,460\nIt's very, very common.\n\n534\n00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,230\nWe see with MP3 files.\n\n535\n00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:21,170\nWhere you might have who the artist is,\nwhat album it was from,\n\n536\n00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,340\nwhat the song title is.\n\n537\n00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,990\nAll that kind of tucked in that MP3 file.\n\n538\n00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:27,590\nWell Mac OS supports doing that.\n\n539\n00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,170\nFor every file.\n\n540\n00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:29,740\nRight?\n\n541\n00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,940\nDefinitely for files that have their own\ntagging system, their own metadata system.\n\n542\n00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,800\nBut even for\n\n543\n00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,400\nfiles that don't have a metadata system,\nApple has a way to be able to add that on.\n\n544\n00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,380\nAll right.\n\n545\n00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,710\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n546\n00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,470\nSo here on my desktop I've\ngot that routing bits PDF.\n\n547\n00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,120\nAdobe PDFs have a full\nmetadata system in there so\n\n548\n00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,170\nthey can store who wrote the document,\nwhen it was published, and so on.\n\n549\n00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,520\nIf I select that document, and\nI pull up its information.\n\n550\n00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,590\nI'll see tons of metadata stored\nright here under more info.\n\n551\n00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:05,640\nThat more info section, that's\nthe metadata from inside of a file itself.\n\n552\n00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,820\nAnd Mac OS is able to pick that up.\n\n553\n00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,970\nIt sees this is the routing\nbit's handbook.\n\n554\n00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,270\nIt was published by, I'm probably going to\nsay his name wrong, but Ruhan Du Plessis.\n\n555\n00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:19,240\nWe can see its full title,\nits version, this is version 1.7.\n\n556\n00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,230\nIt's 389 pages.\n\n557\n00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:25,190\nAll of this descriptive information\ntelling me about that file, all right?\n\n558\n00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,010\nAll right there, okay?\n\n559\n00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:33,490\nThen, If I take a look at this text file,\nfrench1.txt.\n\n560\n00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,130\nText files are very, very old.\n\n561\n00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,040\nRight?\nThis is an old format.\n\n562\n00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,450\nAnd text files don't\nhave any metadata system.\n\n563\n00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,520\nAnd so if I pull up its information\nunder More Info, I just see Right?\n\n564\n00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,218\nThat little -- right there is telling me.\n\n565\n00:29:48,218 --> 00:29:51,150\nThere's no metadata, there's no\ninformation inside of the system for\n\n566\n00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,260\nthis, it doesn't have\nany additional details.\n\n567\n00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,040\nBut that doesn't mean I'm out of luck,\n\n568\n00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:01,360\nI can always add attributes to it that go\nbeyond what it's regular metadata does.\n\n569\n00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,830\nApple has that support so more info.\n\n570\n00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,930\nThat's metadata from inside of the file.\n\n571\n00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:12,720\nThe rest of the stuff we see here on the\nscreen is stuff that Mac OS has derived.\n\n572\n00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,790\nAnd there's a lot we\ndon't see on the screen,\n\n573\n00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,360\nthings that they've added in that\nwe don't necessarily have track of.\n\n574\n00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,600\nSo for example if I look at this.\n\n575\n00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,820\nI can see this is BR1.txt.\n\n576\n00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,620\nAnd I can add tags.\n\n577\n00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,740\nSo I can tag it with a color\nto make it easy to search.\n\n578\n00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,330\nLike show me all my red files, or\nshow me all my blue files to find things.\n\n579\n00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,480\nI can go down here to comments and\nI can just put in here, this is a comment.\n\n580\n00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:40,320\nNow, when I put this stuff in,\nwhen I add these attributes,\n\n581\n00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,010\nthese things to the file.\n\n582\n00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,330\nWhere does it store it?\n\n583\n00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,140\nIt can't store it in the file itself.\n\n584\n00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,880\nA text file is very, very simple.\n\n585\n00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,990\nIf I jump into my terminal, and\nI take a look at that file,\n\n586\n00:30:54,790 --> 00:31:00,650\nwell, a text file just stores my data,\nthis is my data from that router backup,\n\n587\n00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,980\nthere's no information in there\nabout that comment I just added.\n\n588\n00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:10,480\nWhat Apple does, is they track those,\nis what are called extended attributes.\n\n589\n00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,780\nIn some of the permission shows,\nwhen we are setting permissions on files,\n\n590\n00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,690\nyou guys might have noticed,\nthat when I pulled up directory listings,\n\n591\n00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:23,780\nsometimes in the directory listings a file\nmight have an @ symbol off to the side.\n\n592\n00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,560\nRight?\nI never really talked about that.\n\n593\n00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,990\nMostly cuz I didn't care about it, right?\n\n594\n00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,387\nThe @ symbol had no\nbearing in those shows.\n\n595\n00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:33,950\nBut in this show, what that @\nsymbol tells me is that there is\n\n596\n00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:39,400\nadditional metadata for that file that's\nbeing stored in extended attribute.\n\n597\n00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,280\nIt's been added on to that file.\n\n598\n00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,390\nAll right?\n\n599\n00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,170\nSo that's what that @ symbol means.\n\n600\n00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,930\nAnd when I look at BR1.txt.\n\n601\n00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,880\nI can see that @ symbol right there.\n\n602\n00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,180\nMac OS is storing additional\ninformation about that file\n\n603\n00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,190\nin its extended file attributes, right?\n\n604\n00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,743\nNow we just see the @ symbol here.\n\n605\n00:31:56,743 --> 00:31:59,274\nYou can see a little bit more\nfrom the command prompt.\n\n606\n00:31:59,274 --> 00:32:03,593\nI did an ls -l to get the long\noutput of those files.\n\n607\n00:32:03,593 --> 00:32:06,911\nIf I do LS-L@, right?\n\n608\n00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:11,987\nAdd that at symbol, that's gonna make\nit show me not the meta data itself,\n\n609\n00:32:11,987 --> 00:32:15,060\nbut the types of meta\ndata that are attached.\n\n610\n00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,650\nThe extended attributes.\n\n611\n00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:23,235\nSo when I run that, I can find BR1.TXT,\nand notice the very next line.\n\n612\n00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:31,090\nCom.apple.metadata:KMD item finder\ncomment, that's the comment I added,\n\n613\n00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:35,930\nand I can see that it's taking 61 bytes\nof space, the comment that I type in.\n\n614\n00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,090\nSo, that's that extended attribute\nthat's being tracked, and\n\n615\n00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,490\nit's being tied to the file header,\nthe entry for\n\n616\n00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:46,970\nthe file in the file system cable,\nnot to the file itself.\n\n617\n00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:51,721\nIf I were to copy BR1.text\nto another computer,\n\n618\n00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:54,430\nit would lose these attributes, and\nyou might have bumped into that,\n\n619\n00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,900\nyou might have been copying a file\nat some point and got that message.\n\n620\n00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,610\nThat Mac OS will pop up saying,\n\n621\n00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:03,560\nwarning do you want to copy this file\nwithout it's extended attributes.\n\n622\n00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,260\nAnd you say, well crap, I don't know.\n\n623\n00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,380\nThese attributes, they might be important.\n\n624\n00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,610\nWell, they typically aren't.\n\n625\n00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,090\nRight?\nYou copy them over and yeah,\n\n626\n00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:14,530\nyou might loose your comment because the\ncomment wasn't stored in the file itself.\n\n627\n00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,270\nAll right?\n\n628\n00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,910\nWhether that's really true is when\nyou copy between operating systems.\n\n629\n00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,280\nIf you go from Mac to Windows,\n\n630\n00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,640\nwell Windows doesn't support\nthese extended attributes.\n\n631\n00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,010\nIt doesn't know how to read them and\nso they just get stripped down and\n\n632\n00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,690\nyou lose those attributes.\n\n633\n00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,150\nBut, for\nthe most part they're not critical.\n\n634\n00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,610\nThe file itself is still intact.\n\n635\n00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,090\nYou can open a .txt file up,\nyou can read that data.\n\n636\n00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,260\nYou can open that PDF.\n\n637\n00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,230\nThe PDF attributes are intact.\n\n638\n00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,980\nIt's the Mac OS ones that you lose.\n\n639\n00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,240\nSo you lose whether it was\ntagged as red or green.\n\n640\n00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,020\nYou lose whether or not it was,\nyou know, had a comment attached to it.\n\n641\n00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,370\nBut it's not the end of the world.\n\n642\n00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,630\nSpeaking of other operating systems,\n\n643\n00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,370\nif you're gonna be copying\nsomething to Windows for example.\n\n644\n00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,570\nLet's take Windows out of the picture.\n\n645\n00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,390\nLet's say that I want to\nshare data between two Macs.\n\n646\n00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,230\nAnd I've got a USB Key.\n\n647\n00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:07,600\nFor whatever reason instead of formatting\nin Mac OS Journal, which would support\n\n648\n00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,480\nthe metadata, instead of doing that,\nmaybe I format in X Fact, or Fact 32.\n\n649\n00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,010\nBecause I anticipate maybe using\nit on a Windows computer one day.\n\n650\n00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,400\nWell, these extended attributes\nare actually a function\n\n651\n00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,540\nof the Mac OS extended\njournal format file system.\n\n652\n00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,600\nSo, if I'm copying files\nto a different file system,\n\n653\n00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,440\nI might lose those attributes.\n\n654\n00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,180\nSo, Apple created a different\nsolution to handle that.\n\n655\n00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,420\nThey have what's called the Apple\ndouble metadata system.\n\n656\n00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,460\nAnd what it does, is it says instead\nof storing the metadata in the file\n\n657\n00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,110\nattributes, which you can do in\nMac OS Journal, when it goes to a non\n\n658\n00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:50,140\nMac OS Journal file system, it will\nstore that metadata in a separate file.\n\n659\n00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,880\nIt will double the file.\n\n660\n00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,768\nYou'll have the original file, and you'll\nhave the shadow file that goes along with\n\n661\n00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:57,770\nit that contains the meta data attributes.\n\n662\n00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,023\nBecause those other file\nsystems don't support it.\n\n663\n00:35:00,023 --> 00:35:01,240\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n664\n00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,370\nSo that BR1.text file.\n\n665\n00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,100\nThat guy right there.\n\n666\n00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,260\nI added a comment.\n\n667\n00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,050\nI pull up that comment screen.\n\n668\n00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,110\nThis is a comment attached to it.\n\n669\n00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,910\nWell, if I were to copy that to a drive\n\n670\n00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,120\nthat was formatted with a different\nfile system, like my USB stick here.\n\n671\n00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,751\nMy USB stick, if I look at it, is X FAT.\n\n672\n00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:24,798\nRight?\nSo,\n\n673\n00:35:24,798 --> 00:35:28,025\nX FAT doesn't support those\nextended file attributes.\n\n674\n00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:34,185\nIf I copy the br1.txt to my USB stick,\nthere it is.\n\n675\n00:35:34,185 --> 00:35:39,445\nThere's br1.txt, and if I do a little\nGet Info on it, there's the comment.\n\n676\n00:35:40,595 --> 00:35:46,050\nHow did the comment survive if X FAT\ndoesn't support the extended attributes?\n\n677\n00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,190\nWell, if I take a look at\nit from my terminal here.\n\n678\n00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,090\nLet me just get into that USB stick.\n\n679\n00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,050\nRight?\n\n680\n00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:59,990\nAnd I pull up a directory listing,\nnotice that I've got BR1.text right here,\n\n681\n00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:04,850\nand right here I've got ._BR1.text.\n\n682\n00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,315\nIt's doubled my file.\n\n683\n00:36:06,315 --> 00:36:07,221\nAll right?\n\n684\n00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:10,190\nThis file, br1.txt,\nthat's the file itself.\n\n685\n00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,170\nThat's the real file.\n\n686\n00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:15,733\nBut ._br1.txt, that's the metadata, right?\n\n687\n00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:18,140\nAnd it's a very small file,\nit's stored there.\n\n688\n00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,730\nNow the metadata is not stored in\na readable format if I remember right, but\n\n689\n00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,600\nlet's test that theory.\n\n690\n00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,580\nAnd see what we can get here.\n\n691\n00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:31,010\nYeah, see it's warning me br1.txt may be a\nbinary file, do you want to see it anyway?\n\n692\n00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,060\nAnd if we look at it, yeah, it's binary so\nit's kind of a bit of a mess.\n\n693\n00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,150\nI can see that there is\na comment in there and\n\n694\n00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,420\nI can actually read\nthe comment in the binary data.\n\n695\n00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,880\nThis is a comment, well,\nI'm kinda losing my last T there.\n\n696\n00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,780\nIt's not intended to be human readable.\n\n697\n00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:48,633\nBut that's where those attributes would be\nstored to be able to reference those if\n\n698\n00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:51,250\nyou're on a non\nMac OS Journal file system.\n\n699\n00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,200\nYep.\n\n700\n00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,970\nSo the question in the chat room was, is\nthe metadata actually in the real file or\n\n701\n00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,530\nis it linked to the file?\n\n702\n00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,930\nThe answer is,\nthat it's linked to the file.\n\n703\n00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,810\nIf you're on Mac OS Journal,\nthen it's actually inserted\n\n704\n00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:09,870\ninto the file header of the file system,\nbut not the actual file data itself.\n\n705\n00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:13,670\nAnd if you're on a third party file system\nlike this one, X FAT, it's stored in\n\n706\n00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,310\na separate file along with the original\nfile, but it's always separate.\n\n707\n00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:22,180\nIf you want the metadata do be in the file\nitself, that's dependent on the file.\n\n708\n00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,510\nIf it's a PDF,\nyou can use the PDF metadata to do that.\n\n709\n00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,100\nIf it's a GIF or a GIF, PNG,\n\n710\n00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,480\nwhatever image format you're using,\nthey have their own metadata formats.\n\n711\n00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,169\nMP3, MP4,\nthey have their own metadata format and\n\n712\n00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,710\nthat's what you have to use to store\nit in the file itself, all right?\n\n713\n00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,636\nBut these are stored outside and\njust linked to it, all right?\n\n714\n00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:45,120\nNow, why is that metadata important?\n\n715\n00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,440\nWell, for a lot of people it isn't.\n\n716\n00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,820\nFor me, I very, very rarely use or even\ncare about this metadata here in Mac OS.\n\n717\n00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,890\nDifferent story for\nthe metadata that's in the file itself.\n\n718\n00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:58,145\nBut the nice part about this metadata\nis that we can search for it, right?\n\n719\n00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:00,315\nWhen we can use spotlight searches.\n\n720\n00:38:00,315 --> 00:38:05,265\nSo when you go up to your magnifying\nglass up here and do a Spotlight search,\n\n721\n00:38:05,265 --> 00:38:08,489\nyou can actually search\nbased on metadata,.so\n\n722\n00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:12,749\nwhen we start to do a search for,\nthis is a comment or something.\n\n723\n00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,956\nSee how it's searching all\nsorts of different things.\n\n724\n00:38:14,956 --> 00:38:17,824\nIt's searching some of my documents,\nmy spreadsheets,\n\n725\n00:38:17,824 --> 00:38:20,940\nit's looking into these\nspreadsheets to find things.\n\n726\n00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,830\nAnd when I just search for\n\n727\n00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:26,020\nthis as a comment see how my\nrouting bits handbook turned up?\n\n728\n00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,270\nWhy did that turn up?\n\n729\n00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:31,800\nWell I had stuck this is a comment as\na test little metadata entry on that one.\n\n730\n00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,570\nAnd I'm sure br1.text will\nshow up in here at some point\n\n731\n00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,580\nwhen it finds that and shows it.\n\n732\n00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,540\nSo you can actually use\nSpotlight to search.\n\n733\n00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,290\nAnd find that data,\nit's pretty neat stuff.\n\n734\n00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:47,020\nBut it will also search other things like\nit'll search the internet and so on.\n\n735\n00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,040\nSo it uses that metadata to\nbe able to find the files.\n\n736\n00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,150\nPretty cool and neat stuff.\n\n737\n00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,480\nAnd same thing with the search box here,\nit's all linked into Spotlight, and\n\n738\n00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,080\nit gets tied together.\n\n739\n00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,790\nNow one word of caution.\n\n740\n00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:03,450\nYou do have to be careful about\nwhat's in the metadata, right?\n\n741\n00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:07,250\nBecause that metadata information\ncan be visible to other users.\n\n742\n00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,870\nSo you don't wanna have\nthings in there that might be\n\n743\n00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,380\nsensitive information or whatever.\n\n744\n00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,590\nReally you should have\nthe file protected anyway.\n\n745\n00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,260\nRight, if you have file permissions.\n\n746\n00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,432\nBut if you're storing this file on\nexternal media, something like my\n\n747\n00:39:19,432 --> 00:39:23,770\nX FAT USB key here, then the metadata\nis just as visible as the data itself.\n\n748\n00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,640\nAnd there have been quite a few high\nprofile examples of that where companies\n\n749\n00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,290\nlet improper information leak out in\nthe metadata of a file accidentally.\n\n750\n00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:34,270\nFortunately, with Mac OS we really\njust have like the comment flag,\n\n751\n00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,500\nwould be the real dangerous one.\n\n752\n00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,650\nIf you put comments in there, that you\ndidn't want people to see when you copy\n\n753\n00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:44,050\nthat file around, it'll drag that metadata\nalong with it and it can be visible.\n\n754\n00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,366\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n755\n00:39:45,366 --> 00:39:50,624\nWhat we're looking at there is\nthe metadata associated with the extended\n\n756\n00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:55,393\nattributes of a file as well as\nthat Appledouble metadata format.\n\n757\n00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,228\nAnd that's the official name for\nthat too, so\n\n758\n00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,872\non the exam they'll write as\nAppledouble all one word, no space.\n\n759\n00:39:59,872 --> 00:40:01,823\nApple Double metadata.\n\n760\n00:40:01,823 --> 00:40:03,147\nThat's that extra shadow file.\n\n761\n00:40:03,147 --> 00:40:07,090\nThere's one other type of metadata\nthey don't really call out in the exam\n\n762\n00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:07,860\nobjectives.\n\n763\n00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:12,700\nBut I want to mention when you store files\non your Mac when you throw them onto\n\n764\n00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,530\nthe file system for the most part\nyou just have a single file right?\n\n765\n00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:22,020\nAnd so my br1.text file my routing bits\nhandbook.pdf those are just single files.\n\n766\n00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,770\nAnd when I open them up\nthey've got data in them.\n\n767\n00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:28,530\nBut Apple supports what's\ncalled a forked file system.\n\n768\n00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,340\nIf you've ever installed\na program in Microsoft Windows,\n\n769\n00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,810\nyou'll know that one application, one\nprogram, might actually have hundreds or\n\n770\n00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,130\neven thousands of files\nthat go along with it.\n\n771\n00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:44,030\nAll sorts of library files, and\nexecutables, and just tons and\n\n772\n00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,170\ntons of files.\n\n773\n00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:48,150\nBut it's not like that in Mac is it?\n\n774\n00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,130\nIn Mac OS when I install an application,\nI just have one file.\n\n775\n00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,410\nAnd I drag it and\nI drop it in my applications folder and\n\n776\n00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,350\nthat's it, it's there, I'm done.\n\n777\n00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,660\nIt's easy and it just works.\n\n778\n00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,340\nThat's the mantra.\n\n779\n00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,670\nThe reality is, we actually do have\nthousands of files that are there inside\n\n780\n00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,950\nthe Mac OS, we just don't see them.\n\n781\n00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,570\nThey are hidden from us.\n\n782\n00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:10,450\nAnd that's because Mac OS, of course,\nwas called a forked file system.\n\n783\n00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,080\nThat one little icon\nthat you're dragging and\n\n784\n00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,800\ndropping to that application,\nit's actually what is called a bundle.\n\n785\n00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,480\nAnd in that bundle are thousands of\nfiles stored in their own private,\n\n786\n00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,060\nlittle file system that's forked.\n\n787\n00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,800\nThink about a fork in a road, right.\n\n788\n00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,790\nSo you've got your main hard drive,\nand now you've got this spore, for\n\n789\n00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,780\nthe application that drifts off into\nsome other different direction.\n\n790\n00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,410\nAnd inside of that application's\nown little private file system\n\n791\n00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,000\nare all the little files that it uses.\n\n792\n00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,110\nNow, that is hidden from the end users,\n\n793\n00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,390\nbecause the end users\ndon't care about that.\n\n794\n00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,890\nThe end users don't want to see all\nof those files and know about it.\n\n795\n00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:49,190\nThey want to drag an application, drop it\nin the applications folder, and be done.\n\n796\n00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,560\nBut it is there and\nthe reason why I bring it up\n\n797\n00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,810\nis that Apple can store even more metadata\ninside of one of those bundlefile.\n\n798\n00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,830\nThat doesn't apply for\nregular data like these.\n\n799\n00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,730\nLike this pdf or this tech file.\n\n800\n00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:07,850\nBut, for applications, they can store\ntons of data about the application\n\n801\n00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:11,520\nin what's called a manifest file\ninside of one of those bundles.\n\n802\n00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,990\nAnd you can see this stuff.\n\n803\n00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:13,810\nIt is hidden, right?\n\n804\n00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:17,580\nIf I go into my hard drive, and\nI go into my Applications folder,\n\n805\n00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,040\nand I look at my applications\nI don't see that these guys\n\n806\n00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:27,390\nare special separate folders or whatever,\nyou know, especially if I'm in Icon View.\n\n807\n00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,390\nI just see these icons and\nthat's basically it, right.\n\n808\n00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,875\nLet's take, here,\nwe'll take my write application.\n\n809\n00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:33,995\nThis guy, all right.\n\n810\n00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:35,075\nSo I've got right.\n\n811\n00:42:35,075 --> 00:42:36,355\nI just see it as an icon.\n\n812\n00:42:36,355 --> 00:42:39,075\nAnd if I want to use it,\nI run it and that's it and\n\n813\n00:42:39,075 --> 00:42:42,295\nwhen I installed it I just dragged it and\ndropped it in this folder and it was done.\n\n814\n00:42:42,295 --> 00:42:44,055\nI might have installed that\nfrom the app store but\n\n815\n00:42:44,055 --> 00:42:45,615\nit doesn't matter either way, right?\n\n816\n00:42:45,615 --> 00:42:46,145\nSo it's just there.\n\n817\n00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:52,310\nBut if you right-click on that, see how\nyou've got this Show Package Contents?\n\n818\n00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:56,480\nThat's gonna take you from the normal\nroad to the fork in the road.\n\n819\n00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,850\nYou're gonna go off in the other\ndirection and look inside of that bundle.\n\n820\n00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,190\nSo this is a bundle and when I say,\n\n821\n00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,430\nShow Package Contents,\nit's gonna open that bundle.\n\n822\n00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,890\nAnd inside of it I can start\nto see all sorts of stuff.\n\n823\n00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:15,350\nThis Info.plist that has\nmetadata about this application.\n\n824\n00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,380\nIf I were to open that up.\n\n825\n00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,210\nI want to open that up\nwith something else.\n\n826\n00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,316\nLet's open that up with Sublime.\n\n827\n00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:24,100\nWell, where's Sublime?\n\n828\n00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,840\nThere we go.\nLet me just open that up and you'll see in\n\n829\n00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:32,920\nhere, tons of information, like the build\nmachine OS build that this was made from.\n\n830\n00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,990\nAnd you'll find titles,\nthe strings for the files.\n\n831\n00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:38,260\nYou'll find all sorts of stuff in here.\n\n832\n00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,930\nThis is an editor and\nit works with plain text files and so on.\n\n833\n00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:46,570\nIt's just listing tons of\ndetails about this application.\n\n834\n00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,370\nOh, yeah.\nHere's the copyright information for it.\n\n835\n00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,900\nSo you can learn more\nabout the application.\n\n836\n00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,940\nThis is metadata also.\n\n837\n00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,830\nStored inside of that bundle file.\n\n838\n00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:59,290\nThis does go along with the file, but\nit doesn't apply to our data files, right,\n\n839\n00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,450\nyour PDFs, your mp3s, mp4s, things\nlike that, it doesn't apply to them,\n\n840\n00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:06,510\nthis is just for applications,\nthey get bundled together like this.\n\n841\n00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,060\nIf you're ever bored and\nyou want to browse around,\n\n842\n00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,070\nyou'd be surprised all\nthe stuff that's in here.\n\n843\n00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:15,040\nWhen you start to browse in, you'll\nfind where there are thousands of files.\n\n844\n00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,300\nTo me,\nthis is just one little application.\n\n845\n00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,670\nI run the application and that's the end\nof it but inside of that bundle I can see\n\n846\n00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:26,660\nit's made up of tons of icons for all the\ndifferent things it displays on the screen\n\n847\n00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,590\nas well as the actual\napplication itself right there.\n\n848\n00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:31,890\nAnd you'll find other things too,\n\n849\n00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:35,820\nlike its code signature and\npackage data all inside of there.\n\n850\n00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,050\nI picked a relatively small application.\n\n851\n00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,380\nIf I pick something bigger, like,\ndo I have Microsoft Office installed.\n\n852\n00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,100\nLet's see.\n\n853\n00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,810\nI think it's in its own\nlittle folder somewhere.\n\n854\n00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:47,890\nHere we go.\n\n855\n00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:52,610\nIf I take something bigger like Microsoft\nExcel, and we take a look inside of it,\n\n856\n00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:56,600\nwe'll find where it has tons and\ntons and tons of data.\n\n857\n00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,270\nSo you've got just the executable itself\nand then inside of resources, tons and\n\n858\n00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,300\ntons and tons of data.\n\n859\n00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,050\nActually, these are just the pictures.\n\n860\n00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:06,830\nSome of the files and\nstuff I wanna see are really hidden.\n\n861\n00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:10,850\nProbably the biggest one, if you really\nwanna see one that's packed full of data,\n\n862\n00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:16,740\nIs one of the Mac OS installers, so, like\nI've got my install OSX Yosemite here.\n\n863\n00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,620\nIf I browse inside of that thing,\nit's got full installation for\n\n864\n00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:25,645\nthe operating system and you'll see it's\ngot tons of information inside of it.\n\n865\n00:45:25,645 --> 00:45:27,565\nYou've got your install assistant.\n\n866\n00:45:27,565 --> 00:45:30,045\nYou've got your actual package for\ninstalling.\n\n867\n00:45:30,045 --> 00:45:31,185\nThere's the install image.\n\n868\n00:45:31,185 --> 00:45:33,035\nThe disk image for the ESD.\n\n869\n00:45:33,035 --> 00:45:36,415\nYou've got tons of stuff that\nare tucked away in there, and\n\n870\n00:45:36,415 --> 00:45:39,195\neven more that's just hidden\nfrom my current view.\n\n871\n00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,355\nSo, if we dive into some\nof these sub-folders and\n\n872\n00:45:41,355 --> 00:45:43,275\nstuff, you'll find lots and\nlots of stuff in there.\n\n873\n00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,240\nAll right, so that's another place\nwhere metadata might be tucked away and\n\n874\n00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,680\nthat's called a bundle.\n\n875\n00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,840\nNow not quite related to this but I wanna\nbring it up now because it makes sense,\n\n876\n00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,590\nthere is another type of\nbundle that's available.\n\n877\n00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,950\nThis bundle is designed for applications.\n\n878\n00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:02,250\nYou take the bundle, you drop it in your\napplication folder, and you're done.\n\n879\n00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,090\nYou can run it and you're in business.\n\n880\n00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:04,790\nAll right.\n\n881\n00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,420\nThere is another type called a package.\n\n882\n00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,110\nAll right?\n\n883\n00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:13,710\nA package or a PKG file, those package\nfiles are designed to install and\n\n884\n00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:16,400\ndo more than just be drag and\ndrop somewhere.\n\n885\n00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:16,900\nRight?\n\n886\n00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,500\nSometimes when you install an application,\n\n887\n00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,300\nit needs to run some scripts or\nchange some permissions.\n\n888\n00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,100\nIt needs to do more actions\nthan just being copied over.\n\n889\n00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,500\nYou see this most commonly with drivers.\n\n890\n00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,780\nSo if you download a driver for\nyour Mac, maybe you have some printer or\n\n891\n00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:33,640\nyou've gotta download a driver for it,\nyou'll normally download a PKG file.\n\n892\n00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,410\nAn application ends in .app.\n\n893\n00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,180\nA package and it's in .pkg.\n\n894\n00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,302\nThey're both bundles, they're just\nslightly different types of bundles.\n\n895\n00:46:41,302 --> 00:46:46,020\nThe .app files for an application, that\njust runs the program, that's all it does.\n\n896\n00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,890\nThe .pkg extension though,\nthe package, when you run that bundle,\n\n897\n00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,860\nit performs other actions like\ninstalling drivers and so on.\n\n898\n00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,800\nAll right.\n\n899\n00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,500\nBut they do work the same.\n\n900\n00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,940\nLet me show, for example, let's see.\n\n901\n00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,509\nLet me see if I still have switch res x.\n\n902\n00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:05,830\nI use a little program to\nlock in my screen resolution.\n\n903\n00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:10,390\nAnd apparently I don't have the download\nfile for it, let me download it again.\n\n904\n00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:14,270\nSo, I lock in my screen resolution for\nwhen I do shows like these.\n\n905\n00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,970\nAnd I use a little program\ncalled Switch Res X.\n\n906\n00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,370\nAnd when I installed it,\n\n907\n00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:24,180\nit has to install some video drivers\nto modify the way the system works.\n\n908\n00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:28,430\nAnd so it's not just a .app that you drag\nand drop into your application folder,\n\n909\n00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:33,560\nit's actually got a .pkg file that\nyou have to use to do the install.\n\n910\n00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,390\nAnd that's because it's gotta do\na little more than just be copied over.\n\n911\n00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,190\nSo let me download this real quick.\n\n912\n00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,430\nSo it's gonna download that.\n\n913\n00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:48,160\nAnd we'll just extract that.\n\n914\n00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,934\nOh shoot,\nactually this one's a preference pane.\n\n915\n00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:53,590\n[LAUGH] All right Well nevermind so\nthat one's a preference pain.\n\n916\n00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,230\nYou drag that one and\ndrop it into your preferences.\n\n917\n00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,330\nI forgot about that.\n\n918\n00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:59,610\nBut you'll see like printer drivers and\nstuff where they have a pkg.\n\n919\n00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:03,740\nYou can right-click on those and say show\nbundle content also and you'll find them.\n\n920\n00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:06,330\nYou can look at what's inside of them.\n\n921\n00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:09,040\nBut there's normally an associated\nscript that goes along with them.\n\n922\n00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,400\nThat runs and does other actions.\n\n923\n00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,520\nPkg files are also installed globally for\nthe whole system.\n\n924\n00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,100\nVersus apps which we have a choice.\n\n925\n00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,790\nIf we throw it in the main application\nfolder then it's available for everybody.\n\n926\n00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:24,550\nBut if we throw it in our users\napplication folder it's just\n\n927\n00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:25,190\navailable for us.\n\n928\n00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,621\nBut the reason I bring them up in\nthis episode is both .pkg files which\n\n929\n00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:34,290\nare packages, and\n.app files which are bundles.\n\n930\n00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:36,690\nBoth of them can store\nadditional metadata,\n\n931\n00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:40,680\ndescriptions of the applications, inside\nof the bundled filesystem that they have.\n\n932\n00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,880\nIt's right in there.\n\n933\n00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,710\nMac OS supports that,\nSpotlight searches for it, and\n\n934\n00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,260\nthat's how we're able to\nfind that information.\n\n935\n00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,530\nAll right,\nthat's really about it for metadata.\n\n936\n00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,900\nI'm trying to think if there's anything\nelse I want to tackle on that.\n\n937\n00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,740\nI've got a lot more on file permissions\nthat we'll save for the next episode.\n\n938\n00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:02,173\nWe talked a little about system packages.\n\n939\n00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:03,277\nThat should be about it,\n\n940\n00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:06,790\nI can't think of anything else that\nI really want to fill in on there.\n\n941\n00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:10,910\nSo, let's do this, let's use this as\na good spot to wrap up this show.\n\n942\n00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:13,594\nAnd stay tuned, because we've\ngot more that's gonna come up.\n\n943\n00:49:13,594 --> 00:49:16,880\nWe need to talk about some of the file\npermissions that are available, and\n\n944\n00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,795\nthe different folders where these\napplications end up going to,\n\n945\n00:49:19,795 --> 00:49:23,293\nso a lot of stuff that gets outside of\nthe metadata range, but as far as actually\n\n946\n00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:27,290\nworking with our data files, I think we've\nhad a really good chance to see that.\n\n947\n00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,230\nRemember, this whole episode\nwasn't about metadata.\n\n948\n00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:30,630\nIf we think all the way\nback to the beginning,\n\n949\n00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,500\nwe started with links and aliases.\n\n950\n00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,720\nSo remember the difference between\nthe make alias command, hard links, and\n\n951\n00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,920\nsymbolic links.\n\n952\n00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,700\nWhen each one is appropriate,\ncuz that does turn up on the exam.\n\n953\n00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:44,470\nAll right, well let me just remind you\nguys that if you have questions on\n\n954\n00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:48,490\nany of this, live during the show\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live and\n\n955\n00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,860\nyou'll see the chat box beneath the

00:00:40,625\nAnd welcome back to another episode\nof ITProTV, I'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:45,000\nBack again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,280\nWe're gonna be diving right\nback in to managing files.\n\n6\n00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,150\nIf you haven't watched it already, we\nfilmed a Managing Files Part One, where we\n\n7\n00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,200\ncovered a lot of interesting information\nabout how we can deal with metadata and\n\n8\n00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,050\nother things that are inside the files.\n\n9\n00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,020\nWell today, we are doing part two, we're\ngoing to continue on taking a look at some\n\n10\n00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,010\nof the existing files that\nare already present on our system,\n\n11\n00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,840\nespecially some hidden ones\nthat we don't always see.\n\n12\n00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,030\nSo this is some pretty neat stuff,\nthings that we need to be aware of.\n\n13\n00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,980\nSo let's talk about that,\nI've got a machine here that's a fresh and\n\n14\n00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,070\nclean install of Yosemite, right.\n\n15\n00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,360\nSo it's got Mac OS 10 installed on it,\nit's sitting here, and\n\n16\n00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,390\neverything's pretty much at the default.\n\n17\n00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,780\nI am logged in as a admin,\n\n18\n00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,740\nbut even a regular user's gonna get\nthe same view that I've got right here.\n\n19\n00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,005\nWhen you first log in to a brand new Mac,\n\n20\n00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:35,930\n[COUGH] a lot of the file\nsystem is hidden from you.\n\n21\n00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,820\nIt's hidden so you don't see it because\nthe average user doesn't need it, right.\n\n22\n00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,440\nWhat does the average user need?\n\n23\n00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,040\nThey need their Download folder,\n\n24\n00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,960\nthey need their Documents folder,\nand that's probably about it, right?\n\n25\n00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,620\nDownload and Documents.\n\n26\n00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,970\nAnd so when they launch their finder,\nthat's usually where it goes.\n\n27\n00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,730\nYou see all my files, which is really just\n\n28\n00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,690\na conglomeration of all the files that\nyou've got stored in Documents, and\n\n29\n00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,040\nDownloads, and iCloud drive,\nand so on, all rolled into one.\n\n30\n00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,660\nAnd you get these nice little shortcuts\nto jump to your desktop files,\n\n31\n00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,050\nyour documents, your downloads.\n\n32\n00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,980\nThere they are,\nthe files that we need right there.\n\n33\n00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,620\nAnd that's really all\nthe average user needs.\n\n34\n00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,390\nIn fact, as I look at this stuff,\ndo I even know what hard drive that's on?\n\n35\n00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,820\nI don't, they hide that.\n\n36\n00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,380\nAgain, the average user doesn't care.\n\n37\n00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,210\nDoesn't need to know that's an internal\nhard drive, or removable, or\n\n38\n00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,400\nwhatever, it's just hidden.\n\n39\n00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,810\nThey see that's their documents, that's\ntheir downloads, and they're done, right.\n\n40\n00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:35,170\nBut those files, those folders,\nthey're actually part of our home profile.\n\n41\n00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,550\nI know we've talked about home profiles in\nsome of the other episodes, but just to\n\n42\n00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,650\nkind of revisit that, every user on your\ncomputer has a home profile, and inside of\n\n43\n00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,900\nthat folder where their profile is stored\nis all their information, all right.\n\n44\n00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,710\nNow a user can find that by browsing\ntheir profile directory, but\n\n45\n00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,630\nthey don't see that here\nin the menus by default.\n\n46\n00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,260\nWhen I look at the stuff here,\nI see other computers on my network and\n\n47\n00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,730\nthese favorites, and that's it.\n\n48\n00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,950\nBut if you go up top to the Go menu,\nunder the Go menu,\n\n49\n00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,970\nyou'll see links to a lot of other places.\n\n50\n00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,610\nWe've got All My Files, Documents,\nDesktop, Downloads, nothing new there, but\n\n51\n00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,600\nthen, we've got Home.\n\n52\n00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,400\nAll right, what is Home?\n\n53\n00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,090\nWell, if I click on Home,\nI'll see my home profile, right.\n\n54\n00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,780\nThis is the folder that\nmakes up my user account.\n\n55\n00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,200\nIf I were to actually find a path on\na hard drive, it's /users, /username.\n\n56\n00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,340\nSo I just see Don Pezet up here and,\nI can see the folders inside of it.\n\n57\n00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,900\nThere's my Documents,\nthere's my Downloads, right.\n\n58\n00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,410\nBut I also have Movies, Music,\nPictures, Public, Applications, right.\n\n59\n00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,410\nThese other folders that are present\nthat I don't normally see.\n\n60\n00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,150\nThese are ones that\nare kind of hidden away.\n\n61\n00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,810\nNow in this scenario they're hidden,\nnot through any amazing feat of\n\n62\n00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,140\ntechnological science here,\nthey're just not displaying them.\n\n63\n00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,800\nThey're not adding to my\nfavorites over here, right.\n\n64\n00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,470\nIf I know that I'm gonna be going\nto Movies folder all the time,\n\n65\n00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,810\nI might want to add it to my favorites\nlist, that way I can get to it, right.\n\n66\n00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,460\nAnd you can easily do that.\n\n67\n00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,870\nYou can change these guys\nthat are here in favorites.\n\n68\n00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,070\nYou see how you can remove from\nthe sidebar, add to the sidebar.\n\n69\n00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,085\nSo you've got that functionality\nto be able to do it.\n\n70\n00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,250\nBut your normal user doesn't need that,\nright, they don't need to do that.\n\n71\n00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,200\nBut that's where it's located,\n\n72\n00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,930\njust in your home directory and\nit's sort of hidden.\n\n73\n00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,690\nBut there's even more files that\nare hidden beyond that, right.\n\n74\n00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,900\nLooking at this,\nI see a bunch of different folders here.\n\n75\n00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,140\nBut there's even more that don't display.\n\n76\n00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,380\nIf I were to fire up a terminal window,\nand let's do this.\n\n77\n00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,480\nI'll fire up a terminal window.\n\n78\n00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,220\nAnd when you launch a terminal window it\n\n79\n00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,210\ndefaults to go in to your home profile,\nright.\n\n80\n00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,580\nSo I'm in /users/donpezet,\nthat's where I'm at.\n\n81\n00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,090\nAnd if I pull up a directory listing\nin here, I see Applications,\n\n82\n00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,710\nDocuments, Library, Music.\n\n83\n00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,480\nI see all the stuff that I saw right here.\n\n84\n00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,640\nSo that's the same data\njust being reflected there.\n\n85\n00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,580\nI'm seeing, what is that ten different\ndirectories in there right now.\n\n86\n00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,980\nBut if I do an ls-a,\nlet me just do it there.\n\n87\n00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,795\nLs -a is gonna show me all files,\nincluding hidden ones.\n\n88\n00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:15,420\nAnd when I do that, I'll see there's\nmore stuff in here than just the ten\n\n89\n00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,270\nthat I saw a moment ago all right.\n\n90\n00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,510\nLike this guy, Library, there's a folder\nin here called Library, I don't see it.\n\n91\n00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,130\nRight over here I don't see a folder\ncalled Library at all, all right.\n\n92\n00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,990\nThat one is hidden through\na feat of technological science.\n\n93\n00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,382\nSo they've actually modified that\nfolder to make it not show up on\n\n94\n00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:33,300\nthe screen, all right.\n\n95\n00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,330\nThere's other folders in here like .ssh,\nthat's\n\n96\n00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,620\na folder that's storing ssh keys that I've\nused when I connected to other servers.\n\n97\n00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,750\nAnd that one's being hidden not through\na crazy technological feat, but\n\n98\n00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,120\nthrough a simple process of adding\na dot to the beginning of a file name.\n\n99\n00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,500\nIn the UNIX operating system,\nthat runs under the hood of Mac OS, any\n\n100\n00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,280\nfile that starts with a dot is hidden from\nthe graphical user interface by default.\n\n101\n00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,820\nSo if it starts with a dot,\nyou won't see it in Finder, but\n\n102\n00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,870\nyou will see it in the command\nline if you do an ls -a.\n\n103\n00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,260\nAnd you'll see my .bash_history,\nmy .Trash, my .DS_Store,\n\n104\n00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,940\nthis UserTextEncoding.\n\n105\n00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,107\nAll of those have dots before them, and so\nthey don't show up in the Finder, right.\n\n106\n00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,010\nSo if you ever wanna create a folder and\nhide it, you can.\n\n107\n00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,620\nYou can just add that little dot to the\nbeginning of it, and that'll hide it, and\n\n108\n00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,830\npeople will won't be able to see it,\nall right.\n\n109\n00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,500\nNow, keep that in mind because,\nwhat happens when I go in here and\n\n110\n00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,300\ncreate a new folder.\n\n111\n00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,080\nI am just gonna create a new\nfolder right here on my desktop.\n\n112\n00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,120\nAnd I am gonna call it .Secret Files,\nall right?\n\n113\n00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,084\nSo I just put a period right\nat the beginning of it and\n\n114\n00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:45,940\nI am gonna call it .Secret Files.\n\n115\n00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,190\nNow when I did that,\nsee how it gives me a warning,\n\n116\n00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,920\nyou can't use a name that begins with\na dot because these names are reserved for\n\n117\n00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,270\nthe system,\nplease choose another name, all right.\n\n118\n00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,110\nWell, that's not entirely true.\n\n119\n00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,740\nIt's not that they're reserved just for\nthe system,\n\n120\n00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,630\nit's that if I put a dot at the beginning,\nit's gonna disappear and be gone.\n\n121\n00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,790\nAnd your average user isn't going to\nunderstand what happened to that.\n\n122\n00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,730\nWhere did it go, it's gone,\nI lost it, right.\n\n123\n00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,450\nWhen in reality it is there,\nit's just hidden.\n\n124\n00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,190\nThat doesn't mean I can't make it though,\nright.\n\n125\n00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,920\nI can always drop into my terminal and\nchange into my desktop.\n\n126\n00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,830\nAnd I can use the make directory command,\nmkdir, and\n\n127\n00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,270\nI can make a directory\ncalled .Secret\\ Files.\n\n128\n00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,090\nAnd when I pull up a listing here\ninside of the desktop folder,\n\n129\n00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,010\nI can see there's nothing in there.\n\n130\n00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,020\nIf it do an ls-a, there's .Secret Files.\n\n131\n00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,660\nIt's right there, if I do a ls-la, I can\n\n132\n00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,210\nsee that secret files actually has that d\nflag that lets me know it's a directory.\n\n133\n00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,600\nSo it is there, it does exist.\n\n134\n00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,500\nIf I were to change into that folder,\nI could create some files, right.\n\n135\n00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,750\nSo I'll just do a couple\nof fake files here.\n\n136\n00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,792\nAll right.\n\n137\n00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,320\nSo, I know I've got a folder\ncalled secret files.\n\n138\n00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,126\nAnd I know I've got some files\ninside of it but I don't see it.\n\n139\n00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:11,830\nAll right, if I minimize all this stuff,\nI don't see it on my desktop anywhere and\n\n140\n00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,440\nif I go into the finder, and I go to my\ndesktop, I don't see it there either.\n\n141\n00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,720\nThe graphic user interface does\nnot display those by default.\n\n142\n00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,850\nIf you want to browse to a folder that's\nhidden like that, instead, what you need\n\n143\n00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,860\nto do is go up to Go, and under\nthe Go menu, you've got Go to Folder.\n\n144\n00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,740\nAnd in the Go to Folder command,\n\n145\n00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,830\nyou can type a folder in here,\neven if it's hidden.\n\n146\n00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:43,976\nSo I can say I want to go to\n/user/donpezet/desktop/.SecretFiles.\n\n147\n00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:45,600\nAll right?\n\n148\n00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,732\nThat's the folder that I wanna browse to.\n\n149\n00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:53,130\nAnd when I say go, it's gonna jump over\nthere and there's file 1, 2, and 3.text.\n\n150\n00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,960\nThey're sitting right there.\nI'm now in that secret folder.\n\n151\n00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,600\nAll right?.\n\n152\n00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,770\nNow it's not terribly secret, people can\nfind it and get to it if they need to,\n\n153\n00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,430\nif they have access to your home profile.\n\n154\n00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,960\nBut that's how we hide things.\n\n155\n00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,940\nAnd the operating system is doing that.\n\n156\n00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,810\nSo the SSH keys, right?\n\n157\n00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,460\nThose are hidden.\n\n158\n00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,470\nYour average user doesn't\nneed to see the SSH keys.\n\n159\n00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,970\nThe average user isn't gonna\nuse those anyway, right?\n\n160\n00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,300\nBut if I need to get to those,\n\n161\n00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,550\nI can just go to Go > Go to Folder And\nthen I can punch that in.\n\n162\n00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,250\nInside of my profile there's\nthat folder called .SSH.\n\n163\n00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,270\nAnd when I browse to it, there it is.\n\n164\n00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,280\nAnd here's the known hosts file, which\nif I open that, I can see SSH keys for\n\n165\n00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,610\nsome of the hosts that I've connected to.\n\n166\n00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,960\nAll right.\n\n167\n00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,430\nNext, one way to hide files.\n\n168\n00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,220\nThere's another way that\nwe can hide the file too.\n\n169\n00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:40,840\nRight?\n\n170\n00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,750\nMaybe I don't want to stick a dot\nat the beginning of the name.\n\n171\n00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,150\nSo, for example, I might have a new folder\nhere on my desktop called \"Tax Returns\".\n\n172\n00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,839\nAll right, there it is, \"Tax Returns\".\n\n173\n00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,088\nAnd, I want to hide it,\n\n174\n00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:57,217\nbut I don't want to stick a dot\nat the beginning of the name.\n\n175\n00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:59,210\nThat dot,\nthat's a function of units, right?\n\n176\n00:09:59,210 --> 00:09:59,920\nThat's what dot does.\n\n177\n00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,130\nThere's a way we can do in Apple World.\n\n178\n00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,090\nThere's something called a hidden flag.\n\n179\n00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:10,890\nWe can turn on a hidden flag on this\nfolder, and it will hide that folder, and\n\n180\n00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,310\nthen it won't show up in the finder and\nin the GUI any more.\n\n181\n00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,630\nWe can still get to it using the go menu,\nor\n\n182\n00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,000\nwe can get to it through the terminal,\nbut it will be hidden from our finder.\n\n183\n00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,620\nSo Right?\n\n184\n00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,170\nI almost said it's easy enough to do that.\n\n185\n00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,180\nThere's not a way to do that from the GUI.\n\n186\n00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,290\nLike if I pull up the properties of this\ntax return folder, if I go to GET info and\n\n187\n00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,560\nI look in here, there's not\nan option here that says hidden.\n\n188\n00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560\nI can't just check it off and\nbe done with it.\n\n189\n00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,350\nThere's no good way to do it from there.\n\n190\n00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,630\nBut from the command line, you can.\n\n191\n00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,410\nIf I jump into my terminal, and\nI get into my desktop folder,\n\n192\n00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,630\nI'm just gonna do a, ls-la here and\nfind that tax returns folder.\n\n193\n00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,004\nThere it is.\nAll right?\n\n194\n00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:53,730\n>> [COUGH]\n>> Notice that it's a normal folder.\n\n195\n00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,600\nIt's got a D on the left side here,\nwhich lets me know that it's a directory,\n\n196\n00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,040\nand the permissions are set.\n\n197\n00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,568\nI've got the rewrite execute for me and\nread and execute for everybody else.\n\n198\n00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:06,520\nThere's no @ symbol or plus sign or\nanything like that at the end of it,\n\n199\n00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,380\nwhich means there's no special attributes.\n\n200\n00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:08,970\nAttached to it.\n\n201\n00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,990\nIt's just a straight up folder that's\ndoing its normal folder thing.\n\n202\n00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,800\nAll right?\n\n203\n00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,230\nBut I wanna change that.\n\n204\n00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,920\nI wanna hide this so\nthat it's not visible.\n\n205\n00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,520\nAnd we've got a command for that.\n\n206\n00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,090\nWhich is a little CH flag command.\n\n207\n00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,960\nAnd what it does is it changes\nthe flags on the file.\n\n208\n00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,330\nAnd one of those flags\nis to make it hidden.\n\n209\n00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,240\nThere's a hidden and\na not hidden flag that we can set.\n\n210\n00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,250\nAnd that'll take care of making sure that\nthat doesn't display for us normally.\n\n211\n00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,390\nThe command is, let's see CH flags,\nthere we go, CH flags.\n\n212\n00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,420\nAnd you'll see it's got a few\ndifferent options on it here if I pull\n\n213\n00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,260\nup the manual for it.\n\n214\n00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,520\nYou can see the syntax.\n\n215\n00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520\nIt's not a complex command.\n\n216\n00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,220\nBasically when you run CH flags, you\nspecify what flags you want to turn on or\n\n217\n00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,610\noff for a file.\n\n218\n00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,890\nAnd then the file name, and that's it.\n\n219\n00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,770\nAnd if we look, there's a lot of flags,\n\n220\n00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:02,390\nthings like whether we want it\nto be archived or dumped, but\n\n221\n00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,140\nthis is the one that I'm talking\nabout right here, hidden, right?\n\n222\n00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,690\nIf we want to set the hidden flag for\na folder, or a file for\n\n223\n00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,300\nthat matter, we can do that and\nthen it won't show up in the UI anymore.\n\n224\n00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,880\nAll right?\n\n225\n00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,970\nSo, that's what I wanna do.\n\n226\n00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,610\nI want to take that tax returns folder and\nI'm going to say CH Flags, hidden,\n\n227\n00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,190\nand then I'll specify\nthe tax returns folder.\n\n228\n00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,460\nThat's the one that I wanna change.\n\n229\n00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,570\nAnd so it's going to modify\nthat folder and make it hidden.\n\n230\n00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,050\nIf I pull up that ls -la again and\n\n231\n00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,920\nlook at it, I can see that it's got\nthe D because it's a directory.\n\n232\n00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,570\nIt's got its various\npermissions attributes and\n\n233\n00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,618\nnow there's an @ symbol at the end.\n\n234\n00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:48,290\nAnd, an @ symbol let's me know there's\nextended attributes on this thing.\n\n235\n00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:53,230\nIn my case, it's that it's hidden,\nand if I do an ls -le, or,\n\n236\n00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,370\nnot le, l@, there we go.\n\n237\n00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,890\nThat'll show me what those attributes\nare and I can see that there's some\n\n238\n00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,970\nFinderInfo that's been attached to the tax\nreturn, and that's the flag, right?\n\n239\n00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,640\nThe flag has been set to make it hidden.\n\n240\n00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,710\nAnd if I look in the background here on\nmy desktop, the tax return folder's gone.\n\n241\n00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,530\nI don't see it anymore.\n\n242\n00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,410\nIf I go in my finder and\n\n243\n00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,840\nI browse to my desktop, the tax\nreturns folder is gone, it's hidden.\n\n244\n00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,300\nIt's still there,\nI just can't see it anymore, all right?\n\n245\n00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,550\nSo two different ways to hide a folder,\n\n246\n00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:29,310\nyou can stick a dot at the beginning of\nit or you can set it's hidden flag and\n\n247\n00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,790\nthat will make it hidden and\nthat will get it taken care of too.\n\n248\n00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,520\nSo different ways that we can hide it.\n\n249\n00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,890\nNow, you might be wondering why\nI'm bothering going into this.\n\n250\n00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,940\nWell actually, before I jump into that.\n\n251\n00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,960\nOne other thing.\n\n252\n00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,780\nIf you change your mind and\nyou want to unhide it.\n\n253\n00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,900\nAll right?\n\n254\n00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,590\nIf it's just a dot at the beginning of\nthe folder you just remove the dot.\n\n255\n00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,880\nRight?\nRemove the dot from the name of\n\n256\n00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,100\nthe folder and\nnow it's not hidden anymore.\n\n257\n00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,050\nRight?\n\n258\n00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,670\nBut with the hidden flag, we actually\nhave to remove the hidden flag.\n\n259\n00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,160\nAnd the way you do it is by\nreplacing it with another flag,\n\n260\n00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,120\ncalled the no hidden flag.\n\n261\n00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,201\nSo, if I wanted to make that folder\nvisible again, instead of doing\n\n262\n00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:09,280\nCH flags hidden and the name of the file\nor folder, I would say CH flags no hidden.\n\n263\n00:14:11,905 --> 00:14:14,220\nAnd then the name of the file or\nfolder, right?\n\n264\n00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,180\nSo that's gonna set it so\nthat it's not hidden anymore.\n\n265\n00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,060\nAnd now it's visible.\n\n266\n00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,110\nAnd I should just be able\nto look at my desktop.\n\n267\n00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:24,595\nAnd there it is again,\nright there on my desktop.\n\n268\n00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:28,895\nAnd if I go into my Finder, and\ngo to desktop, there it is right there.\n\n269\n00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:30,865\nIt's visible again, right?\n\n270\n00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:33,925\nSo CH flags hidden to hide something.\n\n271\n00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:35,765\nCH flags no hidden to unhide it.\n\n272\n00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:37,055\nRight?\nThat's how we get rid of that.\n\n273\n00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:41,210\nAll right.\nNow, why am I bringing this up?\n\n274\n00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,190\nWhy is it so\nimportant that we hide files and folders?\n\n275\n00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,100\nWe know that we can set\npermissions on them.\n\n276\n00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,830\nAnd if we set permissions we can\nstop people from getting in there so\n\n277\n00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,910\nwhat's the point in hiding a folder or\na file in the first place?\n\n278\n00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,760\nRight?\n\n279\n00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,540\nThe point is not to protect your data,\n\n280\n00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:59,220\nthe point is to make the user\ninterface easier to deal with, right?\n\n281\n00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,600\nA Mac is designed to be\naccessible to everyone.\n\n282\n00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,090\nIf this is your first\nday using a computer, or\n\n283\n00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,150\nif you've been using a computer for\n30 years, right?\n\n284\n00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,610\nThey want to have you covered.\n\n285\n00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,320\nAnd for most users,\nthey don't want a complex file structure.\n\n286\n00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,090\nThey don't want to see a ton of data\nwhen the browse into that hard drive.\n\n287\n00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:19,740\nThey wanna see just what they need, and\nthat's exactly how this is all designed.\n\n288\n00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,600\nIt's designed to be simple.\n\n289\n00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,280\nWhen I browse into the finder, I see\nmy desktop, my documents, my downloads.\n\n290\n00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,000\nMy stuff is right there.\n\n291\n00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,160\nI don't have to dredge through\na whole bunch of stuff.\n\n292\n00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,790\nBut if we want to access the rest\nof the information on our system,\n\n293\n00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,130\nif we want to increase the visibility,\nwe can.\n\n294\n00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,375\nFor example, what if I just want to\nlook at what's on my hard drive?\n\n295\n00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:46,434\nWell, back in the old days, like if you\nran OS 9 or even the early version of OS\n\n296\n00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:50,750\n10, you fire up your Mac, and you have\nan icon on the desktop of your hard drive.\n\n297\n00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,000\nIt would say Macintosh HD.\n\n298\n00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,750\nAnd you can browse right\ninto the hard drive.\n\n299\n00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,000\nWell they got rid of that,\nbecause most people didn't use it.\n\n300\n00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,868\nAnd even then you'd launch the finder and\nyou'd have an icon in here for\n\n301\n00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:03,850\nyour hard drive that you could click on.\n\n302\n00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,070\nThat's gone.\n\n303\n00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,370\nWe still have one for\nif you add a removable drive.\n\n304\n00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,010\nIf I plug a hard drive in that'll show up,\nbut\n\n305\n00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,020\nmy internal drive doesn't show up anymore.\n\n306\n00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,550\nThat stuff has been hidden too.\n\n307\n00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,720\nAgain, making the user interface easy.\n\n308\n00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,300\nIf we want to get to it though,\njust like a one time thing,\n\n309\n00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,020\nyou can up to your Go menu and you'll see\na lot of those options right up here.\n\n310\n00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,670\nIf I go to Go and then Computer,\n\n311\n00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,540\nwhen I chose that I'll see my hard drives,\nmy network shares, my shared folders.\n\n312\n00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,343\nI'll see that information, and\nI can browse into my hard drive.\n\n313\n00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:37,540\nSo, if I browse into Macintosh HD,\nnow I start to see files and\n\n314\n00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,964\nfolders that are in there.\n\n315\n00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:44,310\nBut, even here, I'm still seeing\na somewhat filtered view, right?\n\n316\n00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,020\nWhen I browsed into my hard drive,\nwhat do I see?\n\n317\n00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,300\nI've got Applications, Library,\nSystem, Users, Temporary Storage.\n\n318\n00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,640\nWe created that in another show.\n\n319\n00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,430\nI'll just delete that one.\n\n320\n00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,140\nThat one wouldn't normally be there.\n\n321\n00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,790\nWe were making a sticky bits folder,\nis what that was.\n\n322\n00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,330\nSo that one's gone.\n\n323\n00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,170\nSo these are the four folders\nthat we would normally see.\n\n324\n00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:08,690\nSo if I browse right in the root of my\nhard drive, I just say four folders.\n\n325\n00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,950\nBut there is more,\nmore that's not showing up.\n\n326\n00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:16,460\nIf I fire my terminal back up, and\nI change to the root of this drive and\n\n327\n00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:21,530\ndo a directory listing,\nthere's a ton of stuff in there, right?\n\n328\n00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,870\nSure I see the four big ones\nlike applications, and system,\n\n329\n00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,860\nusers, I see those guys, but\nthere's other ones like volumes,\n\n330\n00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,625\nnetworks, we got bins and cores.\n\n331\n00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:36,070\nYou got all sorts of other directories\nthat your average end user\n\n332\n00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,800\ndoesn't need to mess with, right?\n\n333\n00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,900\nThat they really shouldn't tinker around\nwith unless they know what they're doing.\n\n334\n00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,520\nAnd so, again, it's hidden so\nthat they don't see that, right?\n\n335\n00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,480\nBut the data is there.\n\n336\n00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,020\nIt's there, we can get into it,\nwe can see that information.\n\n337\n00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,870\nAnd we can even make it more visible.\n\n338\n00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,560\nYou'll see there's a lot of preferences in\nthe Finder, so when you're in the Finder,\n\n339\n00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,240\nif you go up to your Finder menu up at\nthe top, you can go to Preferences, and\n\n340\n00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,390\nyou can adjust the things you see.\n\n341\n00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,460\nLike here,\nshow these items on the desktop.\n\n342\n00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,540\nI can tell it to show me the hard drives\nand now I've got that old icon back.\n\n343\n00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,040\nI do this on my own computer all the time.\n\n344\n00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,240\nI like having that hard\ndrive icon right there.\n\n345\n00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,270\nSo, that's an option we can turn on and\nwe'll have it.\n\n346\n00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,670\nYou can see like showing external disks,\nCDs and DVDs, connected servers,\n\n347\n00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,550\nif you've got shared folders\nset up to another system.\n\n348\n00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:24,120\nYou've got where a new\nfolder window opens.\n\n349\n00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,000\nThe finder window goes to all my files.\n\n350\n00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,840\nI know some people love that.\n\n351\n00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,580\nI hate it.\n\n352\n00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,010\nI really don't like that.\n\n353\n00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,420\nAnd you can drop down and\npick where you want it to go.\n\n354\n00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,700\nWhen I launch the finder,\nI want it to go to my home folder.\n\n355\n00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,520\nThat's where I want it to go.\n\n356\n00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,530\nAnd from there I can go to my documents or\nmy desktop, whatever it\n\n357\n00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,610\nis that I wanna go into, or I can hit the\nall my files on the sidebar if I want to.\n\n358\n00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,100\nI don't want it to go straight in there.\n\n359\n00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,740\nRight?\n\n360\n00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,890\nSo we can start to tweak\nthat a little bit and\n\n361\n00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,170\nyou've got the side bar preferences\nup here, which are similar.\n\n362\n00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,630\nIf I go into the sidebar, you'll see the\nthings that are being displayed by default\n\n363\n00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,980\nand I like to add my\nhome directory in there.\n\n364\n00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,130\nSo that I can easily and quickly get to\nthat without having to use the go menu.\n\n365\n00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,820\nAnd now, I'll be able to see that.\n\n366\n00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,320\nAnd you can turn some of\nthese other things off.\n\n367\n00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,370\nLike, I don't really use iCloud drive.\n\n368\n00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:16,450\nSo I might choose to turn that off so\nit's not in my favorites anymore, and\n\n369\n00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,260\nget that one out of there.\n\n370\n00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,460\nOr if you hate that all my files stuff and\nyou really don't want that in there,\n\n371\n00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,930\nyou could remove that and\nget it away too, right?\n\n372\n00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,570\nSo, you can go through and\nkind of tweak these and customize them.\n\n373\n00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,530\nWhat shared devices show up.\n\n374\n00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:33,780\nLike, here, under devices,\nI might want my hard drives to show up and\n\n375\n00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,970\nI might want my entire laptop\nto show up as a list item.\n\n376\n00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,900\nSo, I've got a few options there.\n\n377\n00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,340\nNotice how hard drives, it's kind of hard\nto see here but it's got a little dash on\n\n378\n00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,620\nit instead of a check mark, and that\nmeans that some hard drives will show up.\n\n379\n00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,170\nIt actually hard drives except\nyour primary drive except your\n\n380\n00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,360\nprimary internal drive,\nyour system drive, are gonna show up.\n\n381\n00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,420\nIf you want your system\ndrive to show up too,\n\n382\n00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:00,090\nyou need to change that to a check mark,\nand so I can check each of those off and\n\n383\n00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:06,170\nnow when I go back here to my finder I\ncan see I've got new stuff that shows up.\n\n384\n00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,770\nUnder devices,\nI've got Don's Macbook Pro and\n\n385\n00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,420\nI see each of the different things there.\n\n386\n00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,508\nAnd I can go to Macintosh HD and\nI see those folders there too.\n\n387\n00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:16,050\nThey weren't really hidden\nin the first place,\n\n388\n00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,850\nthey just didn't give us\nthe menu item to get to them.\n\n389\n00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,210\nAnd so now we've got the menu item,\nwe can get to them nice and easy.\n\n390\n00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,720\nThen there's other\npreferences in there too.\n\n391\n00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,080\nIf you poke around inside of the finder\npreferences like under Advanced,\n\n392\n00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,680\nyou can tweak things like\nshowing file name extensions,\n\n393\n00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,500\nif you want to actually see those.\n\n394\n00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,060\nWhether you do the secure emptying trash,\nother things like that.\n\n395\n00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,010\nYou got a lot of different options in\nhere that you can tweak and adjust.\n\n396\n00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,510\nNot to mention the view of the finder,\nright?\n\n397\n00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,180\nWhen we're looking at the finder, this\nscreen has kind of laid out the way that\n\n398\n00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,520\nApple wants it laid out just by default.\n\n399\n00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,630\nBut you can do tweak that too.\n\n400\n00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,110\nYou'll see you've got your\ndifferent buttons up here for\n\n401\n00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,160\nchanging the overall view, right?\n\n402\n00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,030\nYou've got this one, where you can\nchoose how you're sorting your data.\n\n403\n00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,780\nAnd you've got your little gear icon\nhere where you can pull up additional\n\n404\n00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,790\ninformation about the files\nthat you're looking at.\n\n405\n00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,200\nSo different things that are there.\n\n406\n00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,870\nBut if you go under this gear and\ngo to show view options.\n\n407\n00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,800\nYou'll see some other things in here\nas far as how things are arranged\n\n408\n00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,950\non the screen.\n\n409\n00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,830\nWhether you show item info by default,\nyour grid spacing.\n\n410\n00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,700\nSo a lot of this stuff can be customized.\n\n411\n00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,235\nAll right, so\n\n412\n00:21:24,235 --> 00:21:28,104\nthose are some of the things that we need\nto be aware of when we look at the files\n\n413\n00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:33,030\non our systems is that often times there's\nmore there than what we're seeing.\n\n414\n00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,300\nNow, why did I lead into this\nsegment with all this stuff?\n\n415\n00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,150\nMost of this is basic information\nyou guys probably already knew.\n\n416\n00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,600\nWell the reason is, for\n\n417\n00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,330\nthe next part of the show,\nI want to talk about some system folders.\n\n418\n00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,570\nI wanna talk about some folders that\nare located across the hard drive that\n\n419\n00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,180\nperform very important functions for\nthe servers, or\n\n420\n00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,560\nthe work station, but\nthey're hidden by default.\n\n421\n00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,120\nSo I wanted to make sure everybody had\nan understanding of a hidden folder.\n\n422\n00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,110\nBefore I started jumping into\nfolders that were indeed hidden.\n\n423\n00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,210\nBut also on the exam they expect you\nto know how to hide these things.\n\n424\n00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,280\nHow to put a dot at\nthe beginning of the name.\n\n425\n00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,655\nOr to use the CH flags command\nto add the hidden flag.\n\n426\n00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:09,295\nAnd hide something.\n\n427\n00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,045\nThose are testable materials.\n\n428\n00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:12,295\nSo, we definitely want\nto be aware of those.\n\n429\n00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:14,795\nAll right, why we don't do this.\n\n430\n00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:16,435\nWhy don't we stop here and take a break.\n\n431\n00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,589\nAnd when we get back,\n\n432\n00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:21,516\nI want to show you guys the default\nfolder hierarchy that Mac OS creates.\n\n433\n00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:24,395\nAnd then walk through some of\nthe more important folders and\n\n434\n00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:27,343\nwhat their purpose is because\nit is definitely good to know.\n\n435\n00:22:27,343 --> 00:22:29,525\nSo, stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n436\n00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:36,678\n[MUSIC]\n\n437\n00:22:36,678 --> 00:22:38,359\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n438\n00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:42,960\nSo in the first segment we talked about\nhow files and folders can be hidden.\n\n439\n00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,500\nAnd in this segment I want to talk about\nsome of the operating system files and\n\n440\n00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,410\nfolders and\nhow some of these are hidden also,\n\n441\n00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,205\nbecause they don't want\nyou messing around.\n\n442\n00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:52,165\nbut they aren't all, all right?\n\n443\n00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:54,035\nThere are some that are pretty\nimportant that are there.\n\n444\n00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:55,945\nThey're just kind of tucked away.\n\n445\n00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:58,525\nNow, one of the last things that\nI did before we went to break\n\n446\n00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:02,095\nwas to browse through my hard drive,\nand we saw four folders that were\n\n447\n00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:07,645\ncreated on that drive by default:\napplications, library, system, and users.\n\n448\n00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:09,995\nNow let's talk about each\nof these really briefly.\n\n449\n00:23:09,995 --> 00:23:11,605\nWhat does each one do?\n\n450\n00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:13,305\nEach one's pretty important, right?\n\n451\n00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:15,115\nThe most important one is\nthis guy right here, system.\n\n452\n00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,210\nThe system folder is\nwhere Mac OS is stored.\n\n453\n00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,645\nWhen you install OSX Yosemite or\nMavericks or whatever version it is that\n\n454\n00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:29,603\nyou are running, it copied the operating\nsystem files into that system folder.\n\n455\n00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:32,738\nThe reason this is visible is not because\nApple thinks you need to go in there and\n\n456\n00:23:32,738 --> 00:23:33,507\nmess with things.\n\n457\n00:23:33,507 --> 00:23:36,330\nIt's very rare that you'd ever need\nto go in there for any reason.\n\n458\n00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:42,300\nThe reason they made it visible is they\nwanted it to be very easily recognizable\n\n459\n00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,230\nwhich hard drive on your\nsystem was the system drive.\n\n460\n00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,463\nThere are some things that you can't do on\na system drive that you can do on other\n\n461\n00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:52,043\none's as we deal with permissions and\nthings.\n\n462\n00:23:52,043 --> 00:23:55,096\nYour system drive is really important\nbecause when you boot up your computer,\n\n463\n00:23:55,096 --> 00:23:56,958\nthat's where the operating\nsystem is stored.\n\n464\n00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:00,384\nAnd so it's treated a little more safely\nthan some of the other drives that\n\n465\n00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:01,167\nyou might have.\n\n466\n00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:04,460\nSo that system folder is\nwhere Mac OS resides.\n\n467\n00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,057\nThat's where, it's all operating system\nsupport files and all that stuff,\n\n468\n00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:10,042\nright in there.\n\n469\n00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:12,210\nThe next important one is Applications.\n\n470\n00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,020\nThat's where our programs are stored.\n\n471\n00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,166\nSo all these programs you see down\nhere in my launcher, Launch Pad, and\n\n472\n00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,580\nSafari, and Apple Mail,\niTunes, all that stuff.\n\n473\n00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,570\nThese are all stored in Applications.\n\n474\n00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,240\nIf we browse in there,\nthat's what we expect to see,\n\n475\n00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,920\nall of our different programs.\n\n476\n00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,750\nAnd you remember from an earlier show that\nthese are really application bundles.\n\n477\n00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,090\nAnd so each of these is a directory\nthat then contains all the files for\n\n478\n00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,000\neach application.\n\n479\n00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,744\nBut that's what that Application folder\nis for, it's storing the applications.\n\n480\n00:24:40,744 --> 00:24:47,490\nThen we got Users, each individual user of\nthe computer has their own home folder.\n\n481\n00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,530\nIt's called their profile and their\nprofile is stored in that Users folder.\n\n482\n00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,610\nIf I browse in there I'll see\nDon Pezet and Jane Doe, John Doe,\n\n483\n00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,100\nthe various users of my system.\n\n484\n00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,690\nThere's also a shared\nfolder that's in there,\n\n485\n00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,780\nit's assigned to exchange data\nbetween the users, it's shared.\n\n486\n00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,230\nBut otherwise,\nI see my Home folder right there.\n\n487\n00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:09,630\nThat's important to me because when I log\nin, this is where my data is coming from,\n\n488\n00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,610\nmy preferences and other information.\n\n489\n00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,175\nThe last folder is Library.\n\n490\n00:25:16,175 --> 00:25:20,915\nAnd Library is one of the folders\nthat we use constantly and\n\n491\n00:25:20,915 --> 00:25:21,785\nnever really think about.\n\n492\n00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:25,905\nThe official Apple definition or\n\n493\n00:25:25,905 --> 00:25:31,475\nwhatever of the Library folder, is that\nit's designed for application support.\n\n494\n00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:35,615\nIn other words, you've got your\nprograms stored here in Applications.\n\n495\n00:25:35,615 --> 00:25:38,955\nBut what about all of their\npreferences and settings and\n\n496\n00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:41,000\nconfigurations and all of that?\n\n497\n00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,300\nWell, those get stored in Library.\n\n498\n00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,100\nBut that definition is a little bit\nsimplistic, because there's actually\n\n499\n00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,530\na lot more stored in Library than\njust application support stuff.\n\n500\n00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,960\nIt's not just the programs\nthat stores things there,\n\n501\n00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,840\nthe operating system does too.\n\n502\n00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,190\nAnd it is a wide range of things.\n\n503\n00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,060\nIf you browse into that\nLibrary folder you'll see tons\n\n504\n00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,580\nof other information tucked away in there.\n\n505\n00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,730\nAnd, it ranges from simple things like\nwell, the Application Support folder,\n\n506\n00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:13,700\nwhere we see the actual application files\nthat are our preferences and other things.\n\n507\n00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:19,660\nTo Caches, Color Sync, Desktop Pictures,\nthat's where my wallpaper's coming from.\n\n508\n00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,460\nThat stuff is stored right\nhere inside the library.\n\n509\n00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,100\nThe Library folder's not mission\ncritical like the System folder is.\n\n510\n00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,360\nIf I were to damage my System folder,\nI wouldn't be able to boot up.\n\n511\n00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,370\nIf I were to damage my Library folder,\nI'd be able to boot up,\n\n512\n00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,210\nbut a lot of my settings\nwould go back to default.\n\n513\n00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,435\nThey would go back to the way they were.\n\n514\n00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:42,060\nI'd lose a lot of my information\nthat I've done as far as configuring\n\n515\n00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,860\nthe way that things look.\n\n516\n00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,460\nThat stuff kind of gets shifted off.\n\n517\n00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,490\nNow there's a bunch of folders in here,\nand\n\n518\n00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,590\nmy folder list might be\ndifferent than yours.\n\n519\n00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,930\nDepending on what programs and\napplications you're running,\n\n520\n00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:58,470\ndepending on what updates you've done, you\nmay have more or less folders than I do.\n\n521\n00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:02,360\nBut, there's a handful of these folders\nthat are really important that you need to\n\n522\n00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,640\nknow for the exam.\n\n523\n00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,670\nAnd these are folders that are gonna\nbe present on every system.\n\n524\n00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:11,290\nSo let's run through these and I've got\nall of these thrown together into the show\n\n525\n00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,410\nnotes, so you'll have access to that.\n\n526\n00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,300\nIf you watch this recorded,\nyou'll see it on there, but\n\n527\n00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,040\njust to kind of run through the ones\nthat are really important for us.\n\n528\n00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,523\nThe first one I wanna highlight\nis called Extensions.\n\n529\n00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:25,897\nAnd if we look in here there are times\nwhere you might not see one of\n\n530\n00:27:25,897 --> 00:27:27,690\nthese folders.\n\n531\n00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,400\nAnd I'll explain why in a little bit.\n\n532\n00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,260\nThere's these things called domains\nthat divide these folders up, so\n\n533\n00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,080\nsometimes you see them and\nsometimes you don't.\n\n534\n00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,620\nBut for right now,\nlet's just kinda run through the folders.\n\n535\n00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,943\nExtensions, right,\nif I go into Extensions, and\n\n536\n00:27:39,943 --> 00:27:43,510\nI'm gonna turn on my little\npath bar just so we can see.\n\n537\n00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,710\nKind of whoops, that's not what I wanted.\n\n538\n00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,360\nYou see where I going here but\nthere we go.\n\n539\n00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,770\nSo by looking at my path bar here you can\nsee that I'm in Library > Extensions.\n\n540\n00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:58,175\nSo inside of here I see what\nare called kernel extensions, kexts.\n\n541\n00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:01,690\nYou're gonna here people call them kexts,\nwhich I've always hated.\n\n542\n00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,680\nBut the kernel extensions.\n\n543\n00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:09,960\nAnd these are little files that add on\nto the functionality of Mac OS, right?\n\n544\n00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,710\nUsually these are adding\nthings like hardware support,\n\n545\n00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:16,420\nyou've got some kind of special video\ncard or whatever on your system and\n\n546\n00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,200\nit'll have a kernel extension\nthat enables that functionality.\n\n547\n00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,884\nSo you'll see all sorts of different\nthings in here, like here's some for\n\n548\n00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:25,750\nRAID controllers if you have\na hard drive RAID array.\n\n549\n00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,940\nYou've got other things in here like\nSolarity Fiber Channel Network Adapters.\n\n550\n00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,520\nSo different stuff in there for\nsupporting that.\n\n551\n00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,330\nExpect to see different kernel\nextensions on different hardware.\n\n552\n00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,630\nThis is a virtual machine\nthat I'm running right here.\n\n553\n00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:42,210\nIf I were to flip over to my physical\nmachine and do the same thing, so\n\n554\n00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,720\nif I were to browse to my hard drive and\noops.\n\n555\n00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,481\nAnd that's not what I wanted.\n\n556\n00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:52,233\nIf I were to browse through my hard drive,\n\n557\n00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:55,650\nwhich apparently I don't have my little\nicon turned on, but let me just do this.\n\n558\n00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,510\nAnd I'll browse through\n/Library/Extensions.\n\n559\n00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,050\nThere we go.\n\n560\n00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,550\nIn here you can see the ones I've got and\nI've got several that are the same, right?\n\n561\n00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:11,300\nThere's that Softray, the Promise,\nthe Solarity Fiber Channel Adapter.\n\n562\n00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,684\nThose are there, but\nnotice I got Logitech HID device,\n\n563\n00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:17,035\nthat's a Human Interface Device.\n\n564\n00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:20,085\nThat's because I've got\nthis Logitech trackball.\n\n565\n00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:22,075\nSo I install the Logitech software for\nthat.\n\n566\n00:29:22,075 --> 00:29:25,785\nAnd you'll see here's an HP,\na Hewlett-Packard I/O enabler.\n\n567\n00:29:25,785 --> 00:29:27,985\nTo allow me to print to\na Hewlett-Packard printer.\n\n568\n00:29:27,985 --> 00:29:32,275\nI've added functionality to my laptop to\nbe able to communicate with those devices.\n\n569\n00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:35,130\nAnd they show up right\nhere in the extensions.\n\n570\n00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:35,840\nAll right.\n\n571\n00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,530\nSo that was /Library/Extensions.\n\n572\n00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,900\nThere's other things that we'll\nsee in here, Terry mentioned it.\n\n573\n00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,610\nOr, I'm sorry, James in the chat\nroom mentioned, NTFS support.\n\n574\n00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,890\nBeing able to read NTFS\ndrives from Windows.\n\n575\n00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,640\nThose that would be kernel extensions and\nthere's third party software out there\n\n576\n00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,340\nthat'll actually let you\nwrite to an NTFS drive.\n\n577\n00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,350\nAnd that'll show up as\na kernel extension also.\n\n578\n00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,990\nThere's a ton of stuff you\ncan get to add that in.\n\n579\n00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,850\nAll right, so that is the Extensions\nfolder, and like I said,\n\n580\n00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:08,190\nit's mostly drivers but there can be other\nthings that kind of pop up in there.\n\n581\n00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,430\nAll right,\nsome of the other things that we've got.\n\n582\n00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:15,890\nThat was Extensions,\nanother one is the Fonts folder.\n\n583\n00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:21,050\nIf I go back to my library,\nyou'll see a folder called Fonts.\n\n584\n00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,920\nAll the fonts that are rendered on screen,\nthe way this text is written, or\n\n585\n00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,520\nwhen I'm writing a document\nin my word processor,\n\n586\n00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,220\nthe way those letters look are coming from\nfonts, and they're stored right here.\n\n587\n00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,906\nAnd if I browse into it,\nyou'll see a bunch of different fonts, and\n\n588\n00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:37,460\nI'm going to talk a little\nbit more about fonts later.\n\n589\n00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,980\nBecause in the exam objectives they\nactually call out being able to add and\n\n590\n00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,520\nremove fonts to the system.\n\n591\n00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,323\nSo I wanna show you guys that, but\nI'm gonna hold off on that for just now.\n\n592\n00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:52,020\nJust know that when you look at this,\nyou'll see TTC files and TTF files.\n\n593\n00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:58,950\nA TTF is a True Type Font, and so that'll\nbe one font stored inside of that file.\n\n594\n00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,860\nTTC, that's a True Type Collection, and\n\n595\n00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,040\nthat means there's more than\none font stored in the file.\n\n596\n00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,670\nIt's not uncommon for fonts to come as a\nfont family, and so you might have a bold\n\n597\n00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,090\nversion of the font, a normal version of\nthe font, you might have your different\n\n598\n00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:18,450\nvariations like that, or it might just be\na single font all by itself and that's it.\n\n599\n00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:26,048\nSo, TTCs and TTFs, but\nthey're right there in /Library/Fonts.\n\n600\n00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:28,130\nAll right, next we got Frameworks.\n\n601\n00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,601\nNow Frameworks is a funny one.\n\n602\n00:31:30,601 --> 00:31:32,796\nNotice, right here Frameworks.\n\n603\n00:31:32,796 --> 00:31:37,753\nIf I browse into it I see a few different\nthings like Audio Mix Engine and\n\n604\n00:31:37,753 --> 00:31:43,160\nAE Registration, iTunes Library,\nNix Audio, Plugin Manager.\n\n605\n00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,458\nWhat are these things?\n\n606\n00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:49,185\nWell, when you play a video, that video\ncomes encoded in a certain format, and\n\n607\n00:31:49,185 --> 00:31:54,600\nyour computer has to know how to decode\nthat format in order for you to view it.\n\n608\n00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,806\nWhen you play audio files They come in a\ncertain format, right, maybe MP3 or AAC or\n\n609\n00:31:58,806 --> 00:31:59,958\nsomething like that.\n\n610\n00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:03,850\nYour computer has to know how to\ndecode that to be able to display.\n\n611\n00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,520\nAnd so we have frameworks\nthat tell us how to do that.\n\n612\n00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,660\nThat tell us how to decode that data and\nmake use of it.\n\n613\n00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,040\nAnd more importantly, all of our\ndifferent applications can share that.\n\n614\n00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,400\nSo if I have something like\nthe iTunes library on here,\n\n615\n00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,030\nthe iTunes library framework.\n\n616\n00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:24,720\nI could have five different applications\nthat all call this same framework, so\n\n617\n00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,700\nthey don't have to\nreinvent the wheel right.\n\n618\n00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,230\nI use the little audio book manager\nat home that lets me combine MP3's\n\n619\n00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,870\nto build audio books out of em.\n\n620\n00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,310\nAnd It just uses the iTunes framework.\n\n621\n00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:38,040\nSo whoever wrote that software, instead\nof focusing on how to convert audio,\n\n622\n00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,120\nthey said I'll just reuse\nwhat iTunes does, and\n\n623\n00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,460\nadd onto it with my own user\ninterface to do what we need.\n\n624\n00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,020\nSo it's neat that they can do that.\n\n625\n00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,530\nThat's what a framework is all about,\nis reusing code.\n\n626\n00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,330\nNotice how some of these\nframeworks are actually aliases?\n\n627\n00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,600\nThey're links that point somewhere else.\n\n628\n00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,660\nI'll talk about that a little bit later\ntoo, is that these can actually be stored\n\n629\n00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,250\nin more than one place, and\nas long as we have an alias or\n\n630\n00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,890\na link that points back to right here,\nour system will be able to use it.\n\n631\n00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,480\nAnd the reason you'll normally see that\nis if the system supports more than one\n\n632\n00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,950\nversion of that framework.\n\n633\n00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,920\nRight?\nif you just updated from iTunes 11 to\n\n634\n00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:18,150\niTunes 12, well, if that file right\nhere was specifically tied to iTunes 11,\n\n635\n00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,980\nit would have to be replaced, and\npeople would have to know to look for\n\n636\n00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,230\nthe new file name.\n\n637\n00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,970\nSo instead of doing that, they'll put\nan alias in where the alias always has\n\n638\n00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,280\none standard name that software\ncan count on being there.\n\n639\n00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,240\nAnd then it can point to the files that\nhave version numbers in their name, and\n\n640\n00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,790\nall that stuff.\n\n641\n00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,690\nSo you'll see aliases pretty\nfrequently in the frameworks folder.\n\n642\n00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,860\nAll right another one that I\nuse a lot is the logs folder.\n\n643\n00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,910\nIf we look in here we can\nfind a folder called logs.\n\n644\n00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:50,560\nAnd so this is slash library slash logs.\n\n645\n00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,500\nAs your system runs, if it encounters\nany problems or issues it'll\n\n646\n00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,300\nwrite that information to a log file and\nthe log file can be found right here.\n\n647\n00:33:59,300 --> 00:33:59,850\nAll right.\n\n648\n00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,330\nAnd, so\nyou'll see a couple of different things.\n\n649\n00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,210\nLike I've got a setup log file here.\n\n650\n00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,300\nWe've got some stack logs.\n\n651\n00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,260\nXsan which I don't even have, so\nI'm not sure why that one's there.\n\n652\n00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,860\nDiagnostic reports, right?\n\n653\n00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,540\nSo, we'll see a few\ndifferent things there.\n\n654\n00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,746\nAnd when we're troubleshooting,\nif the system's not working properly,\n\n655\n00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:17,560\nI can come to the logs and I can look\nto see if it generated a log file.\n\n656\n00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,470\nAnd if I open that up, it'll walk\nme through what's going on, right.\n\n657\n00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,420\nWhy is that log file there?\n\n658\n00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,290\nWhat happened?\n\n659\n00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:29,516\nAnd I can see what kernel modules\nwere involved and all that, and\n\n660\n00:34:29,516 --> 00:34:32,526\nkind of read through and try and\ntroubleshoot the problem.\n\n661\n00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:42,320\nAll right, let's see, that is logs.\n\n662\n00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,130\nNext is preferences,\nnow out of all these folders so\n\n663\n00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:48,430\nfar, most of the folders are ones\nthat you're never gonna mess with.\n\n664\n00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:51,540\nBut the preference one,\nthat's the one that we mess with a lot.\n\n665\n00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,920\nEvery time we change a preference,\n\n666\n00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,230\nlike what I did in the finder earlier\nwhere I changed the way the finder looked.\n\n667\n00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,880\nI was modifying preferences.\n\n668\n00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,080\nAnd they're stored in\nthe preferences folder right here.\n\n669\n00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,970\nAnd what you'll see is a large quantity\nof files that are p-list files.\n\n670\n00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,870\nA p-list is a preference list.\n\n671\n00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,830\nIt just lists the settings\nthat you've customized.\n\n672\n00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:14,590\nAnd you'll see p-list files in here for\nall of the different applications.\n\n673\n00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,930\nAnd the control panel type items, right?\n\n674\n00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:21,760\nWhen we go into our system preferences and\nwe start modifying things in here,\n\n675\n00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,302\nthese are all being stored in these p-list\nfiles, the settings that we choose.\n\n676\n00:35:26,302 --> 00:35:29,930\nThe p-list files are compiled, so\nthey are stored in a binary format, so\n\n677\n00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,280\nif you try and\nedit it you'd just see a garbled mess.\n\n678\n00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,080\nBut there are actually programs out\nthere that you can decode it and\n\n679\n00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,680\nsee that they're just a XML\nfile at the end of the day.\n\n680\n00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,000\nAnd you can read them and\nsee the settings that way.\n\n681\n00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,190\nBut as I look,\nyou'll see just all sorts of stuff.\n\n682\n00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,990\nThe finder will have entries in here.\n\n683\n00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:50,610\nLike here's Apple remote desktop, we've\ngot security settings, storage settings.\n\n684\n00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,830\nOther things like our directory\nservice if we've got that configured.\n\n685\n00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,080\nAnd third party applications,\n\n686\n00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,340\nas we set those up, we'll get\npreferences stored in this folder, also.\n\n687\n00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,760\nKeep in mind that if you ever decide\nto remove a program, let's say you've\n\n688\n00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,670\ngot Microsoft Word installed, and\nyou decide you don't want Word anymore.\n\n689\n00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,350\nYou can go to your applications folder,\nyou can drag Word and\n\n690\n00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,470\njust drop it in the trash,\nand it's gone, right?\n\n691\n00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,020\nBut the preferences stay behind.\n\n692\n00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,310\nSo the preferences are still there\nif you ever re-install Word,\n\n693\n00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,458\nall of your old preferences\nwill be there again.\n\n694\n00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:24,390\nSo if you're ever trying to get\na fresh start on a program,\n\n695\n00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,260\nyou delete the program.\n\n696\n00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,000\nAnd then you come into preferences\nhere and you find the p-list for\n\n697\n00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,890\nthat program and you get rid of that too.\n\n698\n00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:35,500\nGet rid of that and that way the settings\nwill all start over from scratch\n\n699\n00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,790\nwhen you run that program the next time.\n\n700\n00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:43,860\nAll right the last one that\nthey call out on the exam\n\n701\n00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,030\nis one of those that's kind of,\nit's a deprecated feature.\n\n702\n00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,770\nIt's called start up items.\n\n703\n00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,730\nAnd if I look in here I'll find that\nfile right there, startup items.\n\n704\n00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:58,199\nIn older versions of Mac OS, really OS\n9 and earlier, back in the PPC days,\n\n705\n00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,850\nthis was a folder that contained items\nthat would run when your computer ran.\n\n706\n00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,620\nSo when you booted your computer up,\n\n707\n00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,870\nthese would be the programs\nthat would actually run.\n\n708\n00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,900\nWell once Apple switched over\nto having BSD under the hood,\n\n709\n00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,950\nwe didn't have a need for that anymore.\n\n710\n00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,080\nThere's other ways to make programs start.\n\n711\n00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,350\nAnd when I say programs, I don't mean the\nend user programs that we're going to run.\n\n712\n00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,760\nI'm really talking about services and\n\n713\n00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,690\ndaemons that are running\nin the background.\n\n714\n00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,120\nJust little applications that provide\nsome kind of functionality to the system.\n\n715\n00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,450\nAnd they would be stored in here.\n\n716\n00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,380\nIt's still works.\n\n717\n00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,860\nIt's still supported today, but\nit's flagged as deprecated,\n\n718\n00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,700\nwhich means one day you'll come in and\nthat folder won't exist anymore.\n\n719\n00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,510\nOr you'll put stuff in the folder and\nit won't automatically start up.\n\n720\n00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,280\nAnd so if we take a look at it,\nyou can pretty much expect it to be empty.\n\n721\n00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,850\nOn most systems, it should be empty,\nif it's a fresh and clean install.\n\n722\n00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,280\nIf you see stuff in there,\nit means one of two things.\n\n723\n00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,980\nIt either means one,\nsomebody's still using that folder.\n\n724\n00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:56,970\nOr two, it means that somebody's upgraded\nfrom previous versions of Mac OS,\n\n725\n00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,950\nand they continue to upgrade,\nand upgrade, and upgrade.\n\n726\n00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,580\nAnd so it's still got some stuff in there.\n\n727\n00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,570\nBut Apple no longer uses this\nfolder at all for themselves.\n\n728\n00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,510\nSo it's usually third party\nsoftware that has something in here\n\n729\n00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,150\nin this startup items folder.\n\n730\n00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,470\nBut just to be aware,\nthat's one deprecated.\n\n731\n00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,010\nYou shouldn't use that one anymore.\n\n732\n00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,500\nAll right, so\nthat's quite a few folders right there.\n\n733\n00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,450\nWell, I mean there were actually\na lot more folders, I covered what?\n\n734\n00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,590\nMaybe eight of them?\n\n735\n00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,470\nThose are the eight that we\nneed to be aware for the exam.\n\n736\n00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,000\nThe key ones that we need to know.\n\n737\n00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,870\nBut, there are other ones that store\nvarious things you may or may not need.\n\n738\n00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,080\nLike scripts and security information.\n\n739\n00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,690\nYour speech, the audio files they used for\nthe speech to text, or\n\n740\n00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,730\ntext to speech, sorry, so\nall of that information is stored in here.\n\n741\n00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,490\nIt's all important stuff, but\nthe folders that we covered,\n\n742\n00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,872\nthose are the key ones that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n743\n00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:49,470\nAll right, now for every one of those,\nI was looking in slash library.\n\n744\n00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:53,880\nWhich is right off the root of my hard\ndrive, just slash library, all right?\n\n745\n00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:59,530\nThose settings that are in there, apply\nto the whole computer, to every user.\n\n746\n00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,130\nBut as you can imagine,\nthat's not always a good thing, right?\n\n747\n00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,020\nFor example, preferences,\n\\library\\preferences.\n\n748\n00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,870\nThat is storing my settings.\n\n749\n00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:12,290\nAnd when I went into the finder, and\nI customized my settings in there, and\n\n750\n00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,810\nI said hey I want my\nhard drive to show up.\n\n751\n00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,200\nWhat if another user logs in and\n\n752\n00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,260\nsays, well I don't want\nmy hard drive to show up.\n\n753\n00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,150\nNow we're in conflict.\n\n754\n00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,580\nAnd so,\nwhen it comes to a folder like this,\n\n755\n00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:27,230\nlike the preferences folder,\nwe don't have just one.\n\n756\n00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:32,100\nWe actually have more than one preferences\nfolder that's out there, and that's\n\n757\n00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:36,210\nwhere things start to get really confusing\nbecause they can override each other.\n\n758\n00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,890\nSo here I'm in slash library.\n\n759\n00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,990\nIf I open up another finder window, and\n\n760\n00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:48,430\nI browse to my home directory,\nwhich I'm in.\n\n761\n00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,625\nSo here's my home directory.\n\n762\n00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:53,167\nAnd I don't see a library folder in here.\n\n763\n00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:55,250\nBut there is one, it's just hidden.\n\n764\n00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:59,961\nThere's a library folder just for me and\nthe settings and other things that go in\n\n765\n00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:04,530\nthat library folder apply just to me and\nnot any other user, so when I modified\n\n766\n00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:09,125\nthose preferences in my finder earlier,\nI actually didn't modify it here.\n\n767\n00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:12,716\nIt didn't get changed in\nthe /library/preferences,\n\n768\n00:40:12,716 --> 00:40:16,010\ninstead it got changed\nin my library folder.\n\n769\n00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,609\nSo let me get into that real quick.\n\n770\n00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:25,020\nSo, I'm just gonna use the go menu and\nI'll do that go to folder and\n\n771\n00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:31,490\nI'll change to /users/donpezet/library.\n\n772\n00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,940\nSo looking at my path bar down here\nI can see /users/donpezet/library.\n\n773\n00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,510\nAnd here I am and\n\n774\n00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:42,650\nI can see most of the folders that we\ntalked about earlier, not all of them,\n\n775\n00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:46,860\nbecause some of the folders really only\napplied to the operating system itself.\n\n776\n00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,830\nSo for example extensions.\n\n777\n00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:53,070\nIf I'm adding hardware support to my\ncomputer, can I do that for just one user?\n\n778\n00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,710\nNo, it's for the computer as a whole.\n\n779\n00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,920\nSo I don't have an extensions\nfolder in here.\n\n780\n00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,350\nBut I do have a fonts folder.\n\n781\n00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,960\nI can add fonts just for me if I want.\n\n782\n00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,040\nThat's not a big deal, right?\n\n783\n00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,720\nSo I've got my own Fonts folder.\n\n784\n00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,460\nAnd if I continue to look in here,\nI'll find Preferences.\n\n785\n00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,740\nI'll have my own Preferences folder.\n\n786\n00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,250\nRight?\n\n787\n00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,820\nI'm just going scroll crazy today.\n\n788\n00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,040\nI've got my own Preferences\nfolder right here, and\n\n789\n00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,120\nwhen I set preferences they're\nactually happening in here.\n\n790\n00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,090\nAnd so I have a Finder Preferences\nservice in here somewhere and\n\n791\n00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:27,335\nthat'll define things like,\nwhat I'm seeing it's actually right here.\n\n792\n00:41:27,335 --> 00:41:29,540\nCom.apple.finder.plist.\n\n793\n00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,730\nSo when I changed my finder settings,\nthat's where it was modified.\n\n794\n00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:36,610\nAnd that way when a second user logs in,\nthey have their own find er preferences.\n\n795\n00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,570\nAnd a third user,\ntheir own finder preferences, and so on.\n\n796\n00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:46,550\nSo this is\n/users/donpezet/library/preferences.\n\n797\n00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:51,220\nVersus over here,\nwhere I was in /library/preferences.\n\n798\n00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:56,040\nThat one's global, the other one\nis tied to just me, all right?\n\n799\n00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,290\nApple calls those domains.\n\n800\n00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,200\nWhen we put settings into the library,\n\n801\n00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,350\nthe library actually has\nfour different domains.\n\n802\n00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:03,850\nRight?\n\n803\n00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:06,700\nThere's the global one that\naffects the entire system.\n\n804\n00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,410\nRight?\nAnd\n\n805\n00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,510\nApple actually calls that the local,\nis what they normally call it.\n\n806\n00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,370\nSo those are considered\nto be local preferences.\n\n807\n00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,170\nLocal to that computer.\n\n808\n00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,900\nThen there's the user preferences.\n\n809\n00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,410\nThose are the ones that are these right\nhere, that are in my own Directory, right?\n\n810\n00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:25,580\nThere's another one which are network.\n\n811\n00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,580\nThese would apply if I was in\nan open directory environment.\n\n812\n00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,710\nIf I was connected to\na centralized management server and\n\n813\n00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:35,380\nwas getting preferences pushed down\nfrom it, they would fall under network.\n\n814\n00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,830\nNow, the network one,\nyou may or may not see that.\n\n815\n00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,160\nLet me,\nI'll just do another finder window.\n\n816\n00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,840\nWe'll see how many finder windows\nI can get going at once, and\n\n817\n00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:50,580\nwhen I browse to my hard drive, I just see\napplications, library, system and users.\n\n818\n00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,180\nThere's actually another\nfolder called network and\n\n819\n00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,890\nthe network folder is\njust hidden by default.\n\n820\n00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:59,150\nI don't see it, but\nI can do the whole Go to Folder and\n\n821\n00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:04,010\ntype in /network, and\nI'll see that it does actually exist.\n\n822\n00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,860\nThere we go, and so I'm in /network.\n\n823\n00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,070\nNow mine's empty.\n\n824\n00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:14,780\nI expect it to be empty,\ncuz I'm not joined to an open directory.\n\n825\n00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:19,620\nIf I was though, I'd browse in here and\nthere'd be a library folder in here.\n\n826\n00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:24,177\nThere'd be a folder called library and\nthese would be setting that would be\n\n827\n00:43:24,177 --> 00:43:27,721\ncoming down from the network\npolicy servers and all that,\n\n828\n00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:30,272\nthat's where it would be coming in from.\n\n829\n00:43:30,272 --> 00:43:34,152\nSo, when I go in here I don't see\nthat just cuz I'm not joined to one.\n\n830\n00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:38,225\nAnd then the last one is\nthe System Domain, and\n\n831\n00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:43,720\nthese are preferences that\nare applied to Mac OS by Apple.\n\n832\n00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,470\nThese are the ones that Apple has\npushed out as the default settings, so\n\n833\n00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,430\nall of our default\nsettings come from this.\n\n834\n00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:51,210\nThe system domain.\n\n835\n00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,190\nAnd the system domain is\nin the system folder.\n\n836\n00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,870\nIf I browse into the system folder, I'll\nfind a folder in there called library.\n\n837\n00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,630\nAnd there's actually a lot of other\nstuff in there, too, it's just hidden.\n\n838\n00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,420\nBut the library one I see and\n\n839\n00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,740\nin here I can start to see things that are\ntied to the operating system from Apple.\n\n840\n00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,850\nAnd so if I look in here,\n\n841\n00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:14,000\nI'll see different things that were\nextensions right there because it makes\n\n842\n00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,490\nsense that you could add extensions to the\ndefault install of the operating system.\n\n843\n00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,492\nAnd you'll see other things like fonts.\n\n844\n00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:24,470\nAll right, so my four domains,\nlet's run through those again.\n\n845\n00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:28,190\nThere was user, the user domain,\nthose are the libraries that\n\n846\n00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:31,950\nwere stored in my profile,\nthen there's the local domain.\n\n847\n00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:36,220\nThat applies to the computer, and\nthat's just stored in /library.\n\n848\n00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,680\nThen there's network.\n\n849\n00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,830\nThat one applies to things that\nare coming down from a common directory,\n\n850\n00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:41,910\nlike Open Directory.\n\n851\n00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,570\nSo that would be /network/library.\n\n852\n00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,550\nThen there's the system domain.\n\n853\n00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,708\nThat's the one that comes with\nthe default install of Mac OS and\n\n854\n00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:52,940\nthat's in /System/Library, so, for\n\n855\n00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:58,010\nany given user, there's actually\nfour different Library folders.\n\n856\n00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:00,200\nAnd there's a lot of\nduplication between them.\n\n857\n00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,540\nLike, the Fonts folder.\n\n858\n00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,200\nThe Fonts folder on my\nnetwork was empty for me.\n\n859\n00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,840\nRight?\nBut for fonts,\n\n860\n00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:11,020\nI had a Fonts folder in my user library,\nI had a Fonts folder in my\n\n861\n00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:16,320\nlocal library, the one on the root, and\nI had a Fonts folder on my system library.\n\n862\n00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,590\nSo when the system goes to build my fonts,\nwhere does it get the fonts from?\n\n863\n00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,870\nWell the answer is all of them.\n\n864\n00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:25,090\nIt gets it from all of those locations and\nputs them together.\n\n865\n00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,360\nAnd I get one big super font list.\n\n866\n00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,510\nAnd that's awesome, right?\n\n867\n00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:28,240\nThat's what we want, right?\n\n868\n00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,550\nThat's how we get our fonts.\n\n869\n00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,640\nBut what if there's a conflict?\n\n870\n00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,950\nWhat if it's something like\nmy Finder preferences?\n\n871\n00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,430\nAnd I've got Finder\npreferences set on my user.\n\n872\n00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:38,900\nAnd set on my network.\n\n873\n00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,240\nAnd set on my local.\n\n874\n00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,000\nAnd set on my system.\n\n875\n00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,670\nIf there's conflicting settings, Apple\nactually has an order of operations that\n\n876\n00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:50,580\nthey follow and I've got them in my show\nnotes that i'll post with the episode.\n\n877\n00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:55,210\nLet me just bring it up here,\nI made a little chart right here.\n\n878\n00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,120\nWhere I put the four domains,\nuser, local, network,\n\n879\n00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:03,100\nand system, and I put them in\nthe order that their priority is.\n\n880\n00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:08,560\nIf there's a conflict,\nthe user setting is always preferred.\n\n881\n00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,190\nThat's number one.\n\n882\n00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:14,310\nSo if I've made a change to my finder\npreferences and it's in my user profile,\n\n883\n00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:18,350\nif it's in\n/users/donpezet/libraries/preferences,\n\n884\n00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:19,640\nif it's in there.\n\n885\n00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,610\nThat's the one that's gonna win.\n\n886\n00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:23,090\nSo it looks to that first.\n\n887\n00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,410\nIf the setting is not there,\n\n888\n00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:30,076\nif it's not set,\nthen it moves down the local settings.\n\n889\n00:46:30,076 --> 00:46:33,434\nThat /Libraryfolder, that's what's next.\n\n890\n00:46:33,434 --> 00:46:36,560\nIf it's not there, then it moves down.\n\n891\n00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,230\nIt's a network, and it gets the settings\nthat are coming from the network.\n\n892\n00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,360\nAnd then lastly,\n\n893\n00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,680\nit hits the default from Apple,\nthe ones that are in /system/library.\n\n894\n00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,020\nThat's the order that it goes in\nwhen it goes to find these settings.\n\n895\n00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,370\nSo there will be conflicts, it's expected.\n\n896\n00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:53,870\nYou're going to have conflicts\nbetween the different files\n\n897\n00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:55,420\nthat are stored in these libraries, right?\n\n898\n00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,870\nThere's four different libraries.\n\n899\n00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:59,740\nBut understand that each one\nhas a different purpose.\n\n900\n00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,440\nAnd this is something that your\naverage end user never even sees.\n\n901\n00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,110\nThey don't even see the library folder,\nbetter yet\n\n902\n00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:09,330\nrealize that there's\nactually four of them.\n\n903\n00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:12,000\nNow these three, the local, network, and\n\n904\n00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,620\nsystem, there's only one of\neach of those on your computer.\n\n905\n00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,490\nBut remember,\n\n906\n00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:21,490\nthat the User domain, there's one\nof those for every single user.\n\n907\n00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:25,850\nSo if I have ten users, I'll have\nten different library folders for\n\n908\n00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:30,260\neach of those ten users, in addiction\nto the three that are down here.\n\n909\n00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,310\nSo, it does add up.\n\n910\n00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,180\nThere's quite a few library\nfolders on your system.\n\n911\n00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,130\nAt a minimum, you'll have four.\n\n912\n00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,700\nAll right, so be aware of those.\n\n913\n00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,630\nBe aware of what they do, what their\npurpose is, and where they're located.\n\n914\n00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:44,850\nMake sure you remember their path,\nthat does turn up on the exam.\n\n915\n00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,793\nAnd these are actually\nthe show notes that I'll post.\n\n916\n00:47:46,793 --> 00:47:49,399\nAnd so basically,\nI listed all that information, and\n\n917\n00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,958\nhere's the breakdown of\nthe folder you need to know.\n\n918\n00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:56,440\nExtensions, Fonts,\nFramework, Log, Preferences.\n\n919\n00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,293\nAnd startup items.\n\n920\n00:47:57,293 --> 00:47:59,625\nThose are the ones you need\nto be aware of for the exam.\n\n921\n00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:02,293\nSo if you're watching this live,\nyou don't have this for you right now.\n\n922\n00:48:02,293 --> 00:48:05,875\nBut within a day or two,\nit'll be posted to the site.\n\n923\n00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,750\nAnd you'll be able to download\na PDF of these notes.\n\n924\n00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,417\nAnd it'll be on there.\n\n925\n00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:11,042\nSo, look for that.\n\n926\n00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:15,110\nAll right, well, that's a pretty good\nspot for us to stop and take a break.\n\n927\n00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:17,917\nThe next thing I want to talk\nabout is working with fonts.\n\n928\n00:48:17,917 --> 00:48:21,916\nAnd I want to show adding a font and\nwe're going to look at adding it\n\n929\n00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:26,590\nto the system as a whole as well as\njust adding it to my individual user.\n\n930\n00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:29,910\nBring a font into the system is\nactually a pretty easy process.\n\n931\n00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,900\nBut the fonts are stored in those library\nfolders, so this will be a chance for\n\n932\n00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,051\nme to show you those different domains and\nhow they function.\n\n933\n00:48:36,051 --> 00:48:38,015\nSo stay tuned.\nWe'll pick up with that right after this.\n\n934\n00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:41,540\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n935\n00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:46,710\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n936\n00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:50,610\nSo, what I want to do is I want to show\nyou guys how these different folders kind\n\n937\n00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:54,300\nof interact, all these different\nlibrary folders that we have.\n\n938\n00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,540\nAnd, one of the great ways we can do\nit is by using the font exam objective.\n\n939\n00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,680\nOne of the exam objective,\nI think is kind of silly,\n\n940\n00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:05,780\nis how to manage fonts on top of Mac OS,\nand it's really pretty easy,\n\n941\n00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:09,880\nbut it does give us a great example of\nhow to see how these folders interact.\n\n942\n00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,300\nNow Mac OS comes with a ton\nof perfectly good fonts that\n\n943\n00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,370\nare available on the system.\n\n944\n00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:18,690\nBut if you work for a design company or\na company that has very strict branding,\n\n945\n00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:21,090\nyou may have particular fonts\nthat you've got to use.\n\n946\n00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:24,210\nAnd that means you might need to\ninstall some fonts on your system.\n\n947\n00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,190\nStep one, you go and\nyou download the fonts.\n\n948\n00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:31,880\nYou get them from wherever it is you\nget them step two, we install them.\n\n949\n00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,620\nFortunately they have a really easy\nway to do that here in Mac OS.\n\n950\n00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,900\nWe have a program called the FontBook,\nright?\n\n951\n00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,250\nThink of it as like the Facebook for\nfonts, right?\n\n952\n00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:44,420\nYou have this Font Book where you can load\nall your fonts and you can see them all,\n\n953\n00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,700\nyou can manage them, and\nyou can choose whether or\n\n954\n00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,150\nnot they're available for individual\nusers, or for the computer as a whole.\n\n955\n00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:55,270\nNow by default, when you install a font,\nyou're installing it for you personally,\n\n956\n00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,030\njust for your user account.\n\n957\n00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:00,610\nSo I want to show you that first and then\nwe'll take a look at getting it available\n\n958\n00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:04,290\nfor the whole system and\nall the other users out there.\n\n959\n00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,880\nSo step one, download some fonts.\n\n960\n00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,760\nI've actually already done\nthat prior to the show.\n\n961\n00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,610\nHere inside my downloads folder\nI've got these Tuffy family fonts.\n\n962\n00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:17,210\nSo when I downloaded those, these are some\npublic domain fonts that I grabbed.\n\n963\n00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:20,310\nAnd you'll see where they've\nreleased more than one font file.\n\n964\n00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,050\nNow, I've mentioned early,\n\n965\n00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,690\nthere's really two types of\nfont files that you deal with.\n\n966\n00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:29,120\nThere's TTF, the true type font,\nwhich is an individual font.\n\n967\n00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,610\nAnd there's the TTC,\nwhich is the true type collection,\n\n968\n00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:36,270\nwhich is a whole collection or\na family of fonts in one file.\n\n969\n00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,370\nWell, these I got as individual TTFs.\n\n970\n00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:39,390\nAll right?\n\n971\n00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:42,830\nI could combine these into a TTC\nif I really wanted to go crazy.\n\n972\n00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:43,760\nBut, I don't.\n\n973\n00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,120\nI'll deal with them separately.\n\n974\n00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:45,890\nAll right.\n\n975\n00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:49,250\nI'm going to start with the regular old\nfont right here just the Tuffy font.\n\n976\n00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,800\nYou'll see where there's italic,\nbolds and bold italic.\n\n977\n00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,880\nRight?\nDifferent ones.\n\n978\n00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,100\nI just want the regular old font.\n\n979\n00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,590\nAnd for your typical end user, if they\nwant to install that font they just double\n\n980\n00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,240\nclick on it and it displays the font.\n\n981\n00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,790\nIt shows us what that font looks like.\n\n982\n00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,750\nAnd it gives us a nice little button\nright here to install the font.\n\n983\n00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:13,390\nAnd if they install it, it's gonna install\nit right here into their FontBook.\n\n984\n00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:15,460\nAnd now they've got the Tuffy font.\n\n985\n00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,250\nRight?\nThe Tuffy family.\n\n986\n00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,500\nAnd inside of it, this is Tuffy regular.\n\n987\n00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,490\nBut, what other fonts do I have?\n\n988\n00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:24,510\nNone.\n\n989\n00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:26,080\nThat seems a little odd, doesn't it?\n\n990\n00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,810\nWell, it doesn't mean that I\ndon't have any other fonts,\n\n991\n00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:32,470\nit means that this is the only font\nthat was installed for me, the user.\n\n992\n00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:34,260\nSee on the left here where it says user?\n\n993\n00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,650\nIt's that user domain.\n\n994\n00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:43,510\nThat means that this font was just loaded\ninto /users/DonPezet/library/fonts.\n\n995\n00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,120\nAnd if I go and\ntake a look at that folder.\n\n996\n00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:49,630\nIf I go into my finder here and\nbrowse to that location.\n\n997\n00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:52,640\nI should probably just turn on the.\n\n998\n00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,888\nYou can actually add Library\nto your list here on the left.\n\n999\n00:51:54,888 --> 00:51:55,928\nI could probably save myself some time.\n\n1000\n00:51:55,928 --> 00:52:02,090\nBut I will just navigate the full way.\n\n1001\n00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:05,474\nSo I'll do /user/donpezet/library/fonts.\n\n1002\n00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,810\nAnd there it is, Tuffy.ttf.\n\n1003\n00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:12,320\nWhen I click that install button all\nit really did was copy that TTF to\n\n1004\n00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,620\nthat other location and\nnow I've got that font.\n\n1005\n00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,530\nThe font's available for me.\n\n1006\n00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,990\nIf I were to log in as a different user,\nright?\n\n1007\n00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:21,950\nLet me log in as Jane Doe here.\n\n1008\n00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:28,250\nSo if I log in as Jane and punch in\nher password and go into her FontBook.\n\n1009\n00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:33,610\nShe'll see all the system fonts but she\nwon't see that Tuffy font that I added.\n\n1010\n00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:35,470\nSo I'm logged in as Jane here.\n\n1011\n00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:37,760\nLet me just close all this stuff.\n\n1012\n00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,135\nAnd I'm gonna fire up her FontBook.\n\n1013\n00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,540\nAnd she's seeing this giant list of fonts,\nright.\n\n1014\n00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,250\nWhere are those coming from?\n\n1015\n00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:49,360\nWell, those are coming from the local,\nthe computer font base, right?\n\n1016\n00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,200\nSo that other area,\n\n1017\n00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,300\nthat other library where it's\ngot all the default fonts in it.\n\n1018\n00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,920\nAnd if she scrolls down to the Ts,\nshe can look for\n\n1019\n00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,420\nthe Tuffy font family,\nand it's not in the list.\n\n1020\n00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,610\nAll right, she doesn't have that because\nit was installed to me, personally, right?\n\n1021\n00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:04,290\nJust my account.\n\n1022\n00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:09,960\nAll right, well, what if I wanted that\nfont to be available for everybody?\n\n1023\n00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,490\nWell, there's a few\nways that we can do it.\n\n1024\n00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:19,860\nWhen I launched my FontBook it's\nshowing me user and computer.\n\n1025\n00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,420\nIt's doing that cause it wants me\nto be aware that there's now two\n\n1026\n00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,880\ndifferent divisions.\n\n1027\n00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,140\nIf your user font holder is empty,\nthen these don't even show up\n\n1028\n00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,030\nyou just have an all fonts, cause\nthey're all coming from the same place.\n\n1029\n00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:31,980\nHere, let me show you what I mean.\n\n1030\n00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,100\nWell actually Jane, Jean is that way,\nlet me jump back over to Jane.\n\n1031\n00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:39,930\nWhen Jane launched her font book,\nif you look at it.\n\n1032\n00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:43,310\nSee how she doesn't have a computer and\nuser option over here?\n\n1033\n00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:45,380\nThat's because her user fonts are empty.\n\n1034\n00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,340\nThey're empty so all she has is computer\nso it just groups it under all fonts.\n\n1035\n00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,750\nAll right.\nSo, it doesn't even show it.\n\n1036\n00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:55,540\nBut on mine, because I have user fonts,\nthat's why it's displaying those\n\n1037\n00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:58,540\ntwo entries cuz it's updated\nto reflect that, all right.\n\n1038\n00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,510\nSo, I do have those two different ones.\n\n1039\n00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:07,400\nAs an administrator, I can choose to\ninstall a font either to me individually,\n\n1040\n00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,480\nwhich is what I did just by\ndouble-clicking and hitting install.\n\n1041\n00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,830\nOr I can install it to\nthe computer as a whole.\n\n1042\n00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,480\nAnd there's really a couple of\ndifferent ways to go about that, but\n\n1043\n00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,410\none of the easiest is just right here.\n\n1044\n00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:21,400\nTo click on computer and\nthen I can drag and\n\n1045\n00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,070\ndrop fonts right in there\nto my heart's content.\n\n1046\n00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:28,700\nSo, I could take this Tuffy font, or I'll\ngo for the original one here so I'll just\n\n1047\n00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,210\ntake this guy, or, you know, maybe I\nwant to get, like, Tuffy italic, right?\n\n1048\n00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:35,360\nSo, I'll get the italic one and\nI'll just drag that and drop it.\n\n1049\n00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:40,060\nAnd I'm dropping into the computer\nfolder and not the user one.\n\n1050\n00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,600\nNow you've got to be administrator\nin order to do that.\n\n1051\n00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,370\nSo i'll just fill in my password.\n\n1052\n00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,472\nAnd that's going to get thrown in there.\n\n1053\n00:54:49,472 --> 00:54:54,820\nAnd now I can see the Tuffy font family\nis showing up here under computer.\n\n1054\n00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:58,310\nAnd inside of it there's Tuffy italic.\n\n1055\n00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:00,740\nUnder user, I've got Tuffy regular.\n\n1056\n00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,970\nUnder computer, I've got Tuffy italic.\n\n1057\n00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:10,410\nIf I jump over to Jane,\nJane's looking at her all fonts right now,\n\n1058\n00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:16,260\nand she's now got Tuffy, but\nshe's only got italic and not regular, and\n\n1059\n00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,979\nthat's because where\nthese fonts got stored.\n\n1060\n00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,020\nIf I jump back to my own account, we can\nlook at those files on the hard drive.\n\n1061\n00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:26,270\nI'll use terminal.\n\n1062\n00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:27,940\nIt's a little faster for me.\n\n1063\n00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,495\nSo if I take at look\nat my personal folder.\n\n1064\n00:55:34,645 --> 00:55:36,015\nFrom the terminal if you're\nnot familiar with it,\n\n1065\n00:55:36,015 --> 00:55:39,335\nyou can use the tilde symbol to\nrepresent your home directory.\n\n1066\n00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:42,725\nSo a tilde, that means /user/DonPezet.\n\n1067\n00:55:42,725 --> 00:55:44,167\nThat's what that gets turned into.\n\n1068\n00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:47,042\nSo I'm saying tilde/library/fonts.\n\n1069\n00:55:47,042 --> 00:55:49,605\nAnd I pull up that last, and\nthere's that Tuffy font,\n\n1070\n00:55:49,605 --> 00:55:52,187\nright there in my own font folder.\n\n1071\n00:55:52,187 --> 00:55:54,971\nIf I do the same thing but\nget rid of the tilde,\n\n1072\n00:55:54,971 --> 00:56:00,042\nit's going to look at the big library\nfolder, right, just /library And fonts.\n\n1073\n00:56:00,042 --> 00:56:03,600\nAnd if I pull that up there's\na bunch of stuff in here.\n\n1074\n00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,450\nAnd if I look, I should be able\nto find the Tuffy Italics.\n\n1075\n00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,390\nThere it is right there.\n\n1076\n00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:12,590\nSo that one went into the local domain.\n\n1077\n00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:16,090\nVersus the regular font that\nwent into my user domain.\n\n1078\n00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:16,770\nAll right.\n\n1079\n00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:19,060\nNone of them are in the system domain.\n\n1080\n00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:26,510\nIf I look into /System /Library/Fonts,\nright?\n\n1081\n00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:27,540\nI see fonts in there.\n\n1082\n00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,520\nThese are the default fonts\nthat came with Mac OS, but\n\n1083\n00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,550\nI don't see Tuffy in that list, right?\n\n1084\n00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:37,590\nBecause it's not a default from Apple,\nit's something I'm adding after the fact.\n\n1085\n00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:41,420\nAnd then I'm not joined to\na network server, so if I go and\n\n1086\n00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:48,080\nlook at /Network/Library/Fonts,\nlive directory doesn't even exist, right?\n\n1087\n00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,520\nSo it's not in those domains, all right?\n\n1088\n00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,490\nNow where we have to be careful\nwith this is if we have duplicates.\n\n1089\n00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,520\nSo as an administrator,\nI installed this font a moment ago and\n\n1090\n00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,460\nI installed it to my user account and\nthen I say well, you know what?\n\n1091\n00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,530\nI really want to add that\nto the computer as a whole.\n\n1092\n00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:06,960\nSo my first instinct is, let's just come\nin here and grab this and drag it and\n\n1093\n00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,840\ndrop it in computer, but it won't let you.\n\n1094\n00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,670\nSo I say, all right, well,\nyou're not going to let me do that.\n\n1095\n00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:15,200\nLet me just go down here to the regular\nTuffy, and I'll drag that and\n\n1096\n00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,320\ndrop that on to computer.\n\n1097\n00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,300\nAll right, that's going to install it for\n\n1098\n00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,270\nthe computer so that'll knock that\none out, but see how it's warning me?\n\n1099\n00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,610\nThere's a duplicate.\n\n1100\n00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:26,650\nIf you expand this out,\nhere's the Tuffy font, Tuffy Regular,\n\n1101\n00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:29,240\nand it's telling me\nthat it failed a check.\n\n1102\n00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,970\nIt failed this check right here,\nduplicate fonts, right.\n\n1103\n00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:35,400\nSo it found a duplicate with\na font that exists from my user.\n\n1104\n00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,520\nIt's never a good idea to have\nthe same font installed in\n\n1105\n00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,180\ntwo different domains cuz you\nget conflicts like these.\n\n1106\n00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:46,280\nSo what it's warning me about is I should\nreally remove that from my user profile\n\n1107\n00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,220\nfirst, and then add it to\nthe computer profile as a whole.\n\n1108\n00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:53,360\nI can still do it,\nit will still let me force it through.\n\n1109\n00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,690\nI can install it, and now it's at both,\nbut now I have a font conflict.\n\n1110\n00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:01,020\nIt's conflicting between the computer and\nthe user.\n\n1111\n00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:03,238\nWhich one is gonna win?\n\n1112\n00:58:03,238 --> 00:58:05,130\nThe user, right.\n\n1113\n00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,160\nThe user domain is the first one,\nit gets that high priority.\n\n1114\n00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,870\nIt goes user, then local,\nthen network, then system.\n\n1115\n00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:12,620\nThat's the order.\n\n1116\n00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:15,880\nSo this user one,\nis the one that's gonna win.\n\n1117\n00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,870\nBut see it's giving me warnings,\nmultiple copies of the font are installed.\n\n1118\n00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:24,160\nI can resolve it automatically and\nlet it deal with the problem.\n\n1119\n00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,650\nOr I can resolve it manually where\nI pick which one I want to remove.\n\n1120\n00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:29,080\nWhich one do I want to remove?\n\n1121\n00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,360\nThe computer one or the user one?\n\n1122\n00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,280\nAll right, which one?\n\n1123\n00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,340\nWell, if I do resolve automatically and\n\n1124\n00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:39,195\nlet it deal with it, it's gonna reach\nin there and deal with it eventually.\n\n1125\n00:58:39,195 --> 00:58:43,510\n[LAUGH]\nI hope it's supposed to deal with it.\n\n1126\n00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,510\nIt's just, sitting there and\nthinking isn't it?\n\n1127\n00:58:46,562 --> 00:58:47,960\nAll right well we might\ndo this one manually.\n\n1128\n00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,620\nBut it'll try to resolve\nthis automatically and\n\n1129\n00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,530\nwhat it'll normally do is remove your\nuser one, because it's a conflict and\n\n1130\n00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,910\nas long as the files match you\ndon't need the user one anymore.\n\n1131\n00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:59,620\nBut that might not be what you want,\nyou might legitimately be intending on\n\n1132\n00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,680\noverriding the system one,\nthat could be your whole purpose in this.\n\n1133\n00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,160\nIn which case you could just ignore\nthe error you're already overriding it, or\n\n1134\n00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,830\nmaybe you'll want to remove the computer\none and you can hit resolve manually.\n\n1135\n00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:11,510\nAnd it will ask you about that, right.\n\n1136\n00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:13,990\nWhich one do we want to remove, right.\n\n1137\n00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,920\nDo we want to remove it from\nthe computer or the user, and\n\n1138\n00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,830\nit will just move it to\nthe trash right there.\n\n1139\n00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:20,650\nYou see the option to move it.\n\n1140\n00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:24,070\nSo it just gives you that example here\nwhere you can see the conflict and\n\n1141\n00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:24,950\nkind of resolve it from there.\n\n1142\n00:59:27,012 --> 00:59:30,452\nAll right, or I could just go in here\nmyself and remove that from the user.I\n\n1143\n00:59:30,452 --> 00:59:34,540\ncould just right click and get it out\nof there, so I'll remove Tuffy Regular,\n\n1144\n00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:37,750\nwe'll get it out, and\nthen that's resolved that way too.\n\n1145\n00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,620\nNotice how the user and\ncomputer folders just disappeared.\n\n1146\n00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,540\nMy user folder is now empty, and so\n\n1147\n00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:46,070\nall my fonts are right there in All Fonts,\nit's all combined in that one folder.\n\n1148\n00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:49,400\nNow let's say you're an administrator, and\n\n1149\n00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,860\nyou want to install a bunch of fonts,\nright?\n\n1150\n00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:56,310\nWell the easiest way is just drag them all\nand drop them right there under all fonts.\n\n1151\n00:59:56,310 --> 01:00:00,120\nBut when you do that, they're gonna go\ninto your user settings by default.\n\n1152\n01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:05,990\nSo, if I want them to go into the global\nfonts so that all user have access.\n\n1153\n01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:09,010\nFor that, you can actually change\nthe little setting here in the Font Book.\n\n1154\n01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:11,430\nIf I go up here to Font Book and\nPreferences.\n\n1155\n01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:15,430\nIn the preferences,\nyou pick your default install location.\n\n1156\n01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:17,960\nNow for a regular user,\nthat needs to be user.\n\n1157\n01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,330\nIt needs to install to their user profile.\n\n1158\n01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:23,920\nBut as an administrator,\nwe can change that over to computer.\n\n1159\n01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,560\nAnd now the default install location will\nbe the computer domain /Library/Fonts.\n\n1160\n01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,770\nThat's where it's going to put it and\nthat's what I want.\n\n1161\n01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:34,100\nI wanna make it easy to\ninstall that stuff, and\n\n1162\n01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,040\nI'm gonna tell it to resolve duplicates\nby moving files to the trash.\n\n1163\n01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,370\nIf it finds a duplicate,\ngo ahead and trash the duplicate.\n\n1164\n01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,600\nDon't allow that to exist.\n\n1165\n01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,382\nAll right, and automatic f ont activation\nmeans copy the font in there and\n\n1166\n01:00:45,382 --> 01:00:46,970\nmake it available right away.\n\n1167\n01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:50,940\nThat's a default, so\nI'm not really changing anything there.\n\n1168\n01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:54,670\nAll right, now that my default location\nis global, I've got two choices.\n\n1169\n01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:57,611\nI can still do the drag and\ndrop thing, that'll work, or\n\n1170\n01:00:57,611 --> 01:01:00,552\nI can just double click on each font,\nrun down the line and\n\n1171\n01:01:00,552 --> 01:01:03,697\ndouble click on each one of them and\ninstall the, all right?\n\n1172\n01:01:03,697 --> 01:01:07,353\nSo if I do that,\nhere maybe I'll take the Italic guys here.\n\n1173\n01:01:09,175 --> 01:01:09,880\nBold, Italic.\n\n1174\n01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,340\nI'll just double-click on it and\nhit Install Font.\n\n1175\n01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,790\nSo it's installing, and\nit's prompting me for\n\n1176\n01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:17,990\nan admin password because it's global,\nright,\n\n1177\n01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:22,850\nit's becoming available for everybody, and\nI'll do the same thing for Tuffy Bold.\n\n1178\n01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:27,220\nDouble click on it and install it.\n\n1179\n01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,170\nThere it goes and then the others.\n\n1180\n01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:35,250\nI can take Tuffy Italic, and regular\nold Tuffy, here, and just drag them.\n\n1181\n01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,460\nDrop them into All Fonts.\n\n1182\n01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:39,030\nNow, before, if I drag and\ndrop them like that,\n\n1183\n01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:41,170\nthey go into my regular user account.\n\n1184\n01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:43,010\nNow they're going to go global.\n\n1185\n01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:46,140\nNow, I am getting a duplicate because\nthere's already a Tuffy Italic in\n\n1186\n01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:51,760\nthe global side and I'm copying again,\nbut it'll resolve that automatically,\n\n1187\n01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,420\nor at least should by trashing\nthe duplicate, right?\n\n1188\n01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,460\nAnd it looks like it did it,\nI don't see any warning flags on here.\n\n1189\n01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,060\nI do have a font that was\nbrought in not enabled.\n\n1190\n01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:04,590\nMy regular font came in when I dragged and\ndropped it,\n\n1191\n01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:07,010\nit didn't automatically enable that for\nwhatever reason.\n\n1192\n01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:10,830\nSo, no big deal there, you can just\nright click on it or Ctrl+click and\n\n1193\n01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:11,980\nchoose Enable.\n\n1194\n01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,460\nAnd now it's turned on, and\nthose four fonts are installed and active.\n\n1195\n01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:19,500\nAnd I still don't have a user or\ncomputer folder over here.\n\n1196\n01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,960\nAnd that's because these all\njust installed globally.\n\n1197\n01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,995\nBack in my terminal, if I pull up my\n\n1198\n01:02:25,995 --> 01:02:33,900\n/Users/donpezet/Library/Fonts folder\nIt's empty, right?\n\n1199\n01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:37,193\nBecause my preference was\nto install those globally,\n\n1200\n01:02:37,193 --> 01:02:39,920\nthey all installed into /Library/Fonts.\n\n1201\n01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,981\nAnd if I take a look in there,\nI'll see a bunch\n\n1202\n01:02:44,981 --> 01:02:51,120\nof stuff including all those\nTuffy fonts right there.\n\n1203\n01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:51,781\nThere's those fonts.\n\n1204\n01:02:51,781 --> 01:02:56,263\nThat copied across,\nthose guys right there, okay?\n\n1205\n01:02:56,263 --> 01:03:00,546\nSo we've got them in place and they're\nglobal, so if I switch over to Jane.\n\n1206\n01:03:05,585 --> 01:03:07,580\nAnd look in her font book.\n\n1207\n01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:08,620\nSee how they all appeared?\n\n1208\n01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:10,950\nRight there.\nShe's got Regular, Italic, Bold,\n\n1209\n01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:13,180\nBold Italic they're available to\neverybody on the computer now.\n\n1210\n01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:17,310\nAll right.\nSo, that's how these different folders get\n\n1211\n01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:17,910\nused, right?\n\n1212\n01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,380\nThat's the real important piece.\n\n1213\n01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,010\nThe exam objective is how to manage fonts,\nwhich granted is not like a critical\n\n1214\n01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:28,240\noperation, but it's a great way to see\nthose different domains and their use.\n\n1215\n01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:33,200\nSo on the exam, you definitely\nwanna be familiar with these\n\n1216\n01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:38,390\nguys right here that you got,\n/Users/Username/Library,\n\n1217\n01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:41,110\nthat's the first domain, called the user\ndomain, and it's the one that wins.\n\n1218\n01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:46,070\nThen you got /Library,\nwhich is the local domain, and\n\n1219\n01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:47,310\nthat's the one that comes in second place.\n\n1220\n01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:49,266\nThose are the global settings for\nthe computer.\n\n1221\n01:03:49,266 --> 01:03:53,474\nThen you've got /Network/Library, that's\nthe network domain, comes in third place\n\n1222\n01:03:53,474 --> 01:03:57,029\nand that's when there are settings\npulled down from a centralized server.\n\n1223\n01:03:57,029 --> 01:04:01,739\nAnd then lastly, /System/Library,\nthose are the system domain and\n\n1224\n01:04:01,739 --> 01:04:06,050\nthat's the defaults from Apple,\nthose are in last place.\n\n1225\n01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:09,360\nThey'll take effect if nobody\nelse overrides them otherwise,\n\n1226\n01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:09,890\nthey get ignored.\n\n1227\n01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:11,600\nAll right.\n\n1228\n01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,890\nSo, those are the four domains.\n\n1229\n01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,890\nThat's why we have so many library\nfolders and that's how they interact.\n\n1230\n01:04:17,712 --> 01:04:21,380\nAll right, well, that's a pretty good\nspot for us to wrap up this show.\n\n1231\n01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:22,770\nJust to kind of recap,\nwhat we went through.\n\n1232\n01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:27,060\nWe started off this episode talking about\nhow to hide and unhide files, right?\n\n1233\n01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,800\nWith dots in the name or\nthe hidden file flag.\n\n1234\n01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:34,530\nWe also looked at system files like the\napplication folder, the system folder and\n\n1235\n01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:36,590\nthose guys that are in\nthe root of your drive.\n\n1236\n01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:40,010\nAnd then lastly we started talking about\nthose libraries, right, and how they're\n\n1237\n01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:43,730\nlittered across these different domains,\nand how settings can override each other.\n\n1238\n01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:46,290\nAll really important stuff,\nall testable material.\n\n1239\n01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:48,560\nAll right, well, let me remind you guys,\n\n1240\n01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,500\nif you have questions on any of this,\nplease feel free to ask.\n\n1241\n01:04:52,500 -->

00:00:36,090\nAlright, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,610\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,390\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,670\nBack again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n8\n00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,330\nIn this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at file archives and images.\n\n9\n00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,850\nAnd really, those are just fancy ways of\nsaying ways that we can bundle up our\n\n10\n00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,680\nfiles together and make them easier to\nmove around, back up, and deal with.\n\n11\n00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,590\nLet's start with file archives.\n\n12\n00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,240\nWhen you have a large quantity of files\nthat you need to send to somebody via\n\n13\n00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,690\nemail, or shared folders or whatever.\n\n14\n00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,980\nSometimes it can be useful to\nbundle them together into one file,\n\n15\n00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,790\ninstead of dealing with a bunch\nof individual files, right?\n\n16\n00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,550\nI don't know if you've\never had this before,\n\n17\n00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,210\nwhere you get an email from somebody\nthat says hey look at these pictures.\n\n18\n00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,250\nAnd there's 50 pictures attached to\nthe email, all as separate attachments.\n\n19\n00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,322\nAnd you're like great, now I gotta\ndownload each of those attachments and\n\n20\n00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:22,918\ndeal with it.\n\n21\n00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:28,400\nIt's far easier if they're\ncompressed all into one file, right?\n\n22\n00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,390\nStored in one archive file,\nI can just download that one file, and\n\n23\n00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,070\nthen extract all the individual\nfiles from inside of it.\n\n24\n00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,810\nWell, Mac OS has support for that\nbuilt right into the operating system.\n\n25\n00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,710\nWe don't even need third party software.\n\n26\n00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,160\nYou can combine, and then un-combine\nfiles really, really easily.\n\n27\n00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,660\nMac OS uses the ZIP file format.\n\n28\n00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,920\nAnd ZIP, it originated from\na company called PKWARE.\n\n29\n00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,870\nThey created this archive\nformat that did two things.\n\n30\n00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,460\nOne, it combined the files together.\n\n31\n00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,120\nAnd two, it applied a compression\nalgorithm to try and make the files\n\n32\n00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,680\nsmaller than they were normally,\nright, if they weren't compressed.\n\n33\n00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,840\nAnd so\nit's kind of neat that it does both.\n\n34\n00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,790\nA smaller file will transmit over\na network easier, and then once it gets to\n\n35\n00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,860\nthe other side, they can extract it and\nthe files are back to their normal size.\n\n36\n00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,310\nSo pretty neat functionality, all right?\n\n37\n00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,870\nLet me show you how it works\nright here inside of Mac OS.\n\n38\n00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,470\nSo on my desktop I've got some router\nconfiguration files from our Cisco show.\n\n39\n00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,580\nAnd if I browse in there,\nthey're just a bunch of text files,\n\n40\n00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,422\nI can see them right here.\n\n41\n00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:32,265\nThese are Different routers that I have,\nand their config files, all right?\n\n42\n00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:37,135\nIf pull up my detailed list,\nI can see they're all about 2 KB in size.\n\n43\n00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:39,415\nThe biggest one is 5 KB right there.\n\n44\n00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:41,635\nSo they're not terribly large files.\n\n45\n00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:45,085\nBut I don't wanna have to attach each\none to an email individually, or\n\n46\n00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:47,475\nhave somebody on the other side try and\ndownload them that way.\n\n47\n00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:49,570\nI wanna combine these Into one file.\n\n48\n00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,380\nSo to do that all you have to do\nis highlight the files, right?\n\n49\n00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,920\nSo I've highlighted all of those files,\nand\n\n50\n00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,110\nthen you can Ctrl+click or right-click.\n\n51\n00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,744\nAnd you'll see the option in here\nCompress 7 Items, all right?\n\n52\n00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:09,810\nIt's gonna say compress and then whatever\nnumber of files you've selected, items.\n\n53\n00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,520\nAnd that's gonna take those files and\n\n54\n00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,360\nshrink them all into one file\nthat's compressed, all right?\n\n55\n00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,720\nIf I compress those seven items,\n\n56\n00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,220\nit's gonna do it and\nit's gonna create this file Archive.zip.\n\n57\n00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,210\nNow, notice that Archive.zip\nfile is only 6 KB in size.\n\n58\n00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,100\nWell, any three of my files\nwould have been 6 KB.\n\n59\n00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,140\nWhat happened to all the rest of it,\nright?\n\n60\n00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,660\nThere's over, well, I don't know,\n\n61\n00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,540\nprobably about 20k more data\nright there that disappeared.\n\n62\n00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,630\nWell it didn't disappear, all\nthe duplicates, all that other information\n\n63\n00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,670\nis able to be extracted and\nremoved and the files are shrunk down.\n\n64\n00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,850\nAnd at the other end, whoever receives\nthis will be able to extract the data and\n\n65\n00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,640\nget it out of there, all right?\n\n66\n00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,740\nNow there are many,\n\n67\n00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,720\nmany other file formats that\nare out there other than just .ZIP.\n\n68\n00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,250\nBut Apple settled on .ZIP because almost\n\n69\n00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,510\nevery operating system\nout there supports it.\n\n70\n00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,990\nMost UNIX and Linux distributions\nhave ZIP support by default.\n\n71\n00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,250\nAll versions of Microsoft Windows\nhave ZIP support by default.\n\n72\n00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,780\niPhone and Android phones\nhave ZIP support by default.\n\n73\n00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,360\nSo it's pretty ubiquitous, right?\n\n74\n00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,870\nA lot people have support for\nit, and that's why we've got it.\n\n75\n00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,608\nBut there other formats\nthat are out there.\n\n76\n00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:21,420\nLike the Tar GZip format or\nTGZ, you'll see a lot of that.\n\n77\n00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,670\nUnix system have TGZ support baked in, but\nsystem's like Windows don't, all right?\n\n78\n00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,140\nYou might see RAR, or\n7-Zip, or other formats.\n\n79\n00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,270\nThose are great formats too.\n\n80\n00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,190\nBut not natively supported by the OS.\n\n81\n00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,485\nSo if you want a guarantee that the person\non the other end of this communication is\n\n82\n00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:42,070\ngonna be able to open that file,\nyou stick with ZIP.\n\n83\n00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,940\nAnd so that's why Apple chose that one.\n\n84\n00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:49,208\nAnd that file, you can rename it, right?\n\n85\n00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,725\nI might want to call it\nRouter Configs.zip, right, so\n\n86\n00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,160\nthat I know what it is.\n\n87\n00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,220\nBut at the end of the day,\nmy configuration files are in there,\n\n88\n00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,890\nand if I delete my files, so I'll just\nthrow those down there in my trash.\n\n89\n00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,950\nSo they're gone,\nI'm just left with my configs.\n\n90\n00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,020\nIf I wanna get the files\nout of there again,\n\n91\n00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,510\nI can always just right-click on that.\n\n92\n00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,170\nAnd you'll see the option\nin here to extract,\n\n93\n00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,460\nand actually it doesn't show up does it?\n\n94\n00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,440\nI use a slightly different\nprogram called Entropy so\n\n95\n00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,890\nI have my option way down there.\n\n96\n00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,810\nBut in our user interface,\nwe can just double-click on it and\n\n97\n00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,420\nthat will extract it also.\n\n98\n00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,350\nI forgot, I've got this third\nparty software installed\n\n99\n00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,500\nthat's kind of getting in the way of this.\n\n100\n00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,920\nNormally with Mac OS,\n\n101\n00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,040\nif you were to just double-click on that,\nit would extract out.\n\n102\n00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,580\nBut since I've got this Entropy software\ninstalled, when I double-click on it,\n\n103\n00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,060\nit's gonna fire up in Entropy.\n\n104\n00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,860\nSo let me just change that real quick so\nthat it's not opening with Entropy.\n\n105\n00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,860\nNotice that I've got, in the file\ninformation here, open with Entropy.\n\n106\n00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,450\nThe other option is Archive Utility,\nand the Archive Utility is what's part\n\n107\n00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,283\nof the Mac OS operating system,\nso I'm just gonna change that.\n\n108\n00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,870\nSo that that's what it's\ngoing to open with.\n\n109\n00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,750\nAnd when I double-click on it now,\nsee how it didn't ask me any questions,\n\n110\n00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,130\nit just extracted it.\n\n111\n00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,660\nIt created a folder with\nthe same name as the file and\n\n112\n00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,370\nit put all the individual\nfiles inside of there, right.\n\n113\n00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,162\nSo that's what it does when it's\nthe default just base Mac OS system.\n\n114\n00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,940\nYou double-click on the file and\n\n115\n00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,590\nit automatically extracts it into\na folder with the same name as the file.\n\n116\n00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,400\nAnd now I can get into these files,\nthey're just text files.\n\n117\n00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,210\nAnd I can jump in and I can see my router\nconfigs and all that information, right?\n\n118\n00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,380\nJust laid out right there, no big deal.\n\n119\n00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:32,840\nAll right, so that's an easy way to\narchive files and send them along.\n\n120\n00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,980\nIt makes them smaller and\nit makes them a single file.\n\n121\n00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,690\nSo if I want to send all these\nrouter configs to somebody else,\n\n122\n00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,440\nnow it's just this one file,\nI send it and that's the end of it.\n\n123\n00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,660\nFor most of us, that's the archive\nformat that we're going to use.\n\n124\n00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,000\nIt's the most convenient, it's quick, it's\neasy, and it doesn't take a lot of space.\n\n125\n00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,870\nBut there's other formats that we can use\ntoo for various other reasons, all right?\n\n126\n00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,090\nThis is considered an archive,\n\n127\n00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,320\nand that term archive just means you\ncombine multiple files into one.\n\n128\n00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,030\nThere's another type of archive that we\ncan make, though, that's called an image.\n\n129\n00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:11,120\nNow images, in the old days,\nwere basically a copy of a physical disk.\n\n130\n00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,150\nIf you had a hard drive or\na CD you could make an image of it,\n\n131\n00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,100\nwhich basically had the same contents,\nlike a clone of that data.\n\n132\n00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,500\nBut it was stored in a digital\nfile on your computer\n\n133\n00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,640\ninstead of being stored on\na actual physical disk.\n\n134\n00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,940\nWe see this all the time when we\ndownload third party software, right?\n\n135\n00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,110\nIf you have some third party software out\nthere that you want to install in Mac OS,\n\n136\n00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,550\nright?\n\n137\n00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,460\nLet's see if I can think of some kind of\nsoftware that I might want to install.\n\n138\n00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,834\nLet's see, what could we install today?\n\n139\n00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:47,010\nI'm trying to think of something that's\nnot going to get my computer crazy and\n\n140\n00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,165\ninfected or anything like that.\n\n141\n00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:51,340\n[LAUGH] You never know with this stuff.\n\n142\n00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,040\nLet's say we wanted 7-Zip,\nI mentioned that one earlier, right?\n\n143\n00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,710\nIf I want 7-Zip we can go, and I'm pretty\nsure they have a Mac version, don't they?\n\n144\n00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,000\nYou know what?\n\n145\n00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,630\nThey don't, do they?\n\n146\n00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,430\nIt looks like they are all Windows.\n\n147\n00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,100\nYeah, these guys have a Mac version.\n\n148\n00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,140\nSo we can go download software\nfrom these other companies and\n\n149\n00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,700\nthey'll normally give it to\nus in an image format, right?\n\n150\n00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,420\nWith a zip,\nthe files are all together, and\n\n151\n00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,020\nwhen you double-click on it they just\nextract and that's the end of it.\n\n152\n00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,020\nBut with an image file,\nit shows up like a hard drive.\n\n153\n00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,380\nAnd when you double-click on it, it shows\nas if you had plugged in a USB key or\n\n154\n00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,470\nsomething like that.\n\n155\n00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,580\nAnd you see the files.\n\n156\n00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,320\nAnd then you can drag and\ndrop them to wherever we want.\n\n157\n00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,050\nAnd that's how a lot of\nour installation goes.\n\n158\n00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,020\nThis is not voting well,\nthis website is covered in ads.\n\n159\n00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,388\nPretty sure I don't wanna\ninstall software from there.\n\n160\n00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:41,190\n[LAUGH] We'll use Royal ts.\n\n161\n00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,790\nI like Royal ts.\n\n162\n00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:48,560\nThat's an application I actually pay for,\nso if we give that one a shot.\n\n163\n00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,860\nActually, I need royal tsx,\nis what I need.\n\n164\n00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,693\nAnd we'll just download this one,\nroyal tsx, and we'll download it.\n\n165\n00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:04,733\nAll right, so I'm downloading this file,\nand if I find the file as soon\n\n166\n00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:09,605\nas it's downloading, notice the file\nname that's downloading and\n\n167\n00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:13,983\nit says- Royaltysx__2.0.1.1000-2.dmg.\n\n168\n00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,425\nAll right what is that dmg?\n\n169\n00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:17,762\nWell dmg is a disc image.\n\n170\n00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:20,836\nRight.\nThis archive is an image of a disc.\n\n171\n00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:22,483\nNow I don't know where that disc is from.\n\n172\n00:09:22,483 --> 00:09:26,350\nIt's some disc that the developer created\nand then they put the software in there.\n\n173\n00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,260\nBut when I click on that, instead of\nextracting out the hard drive like a zip\n\n174\n00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,110\nfile would,\nthis one turns into a virtual drive.\n\n175\n00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,450\nIf I shrink all this stuff,\nand look at my finder,\n\n176\n00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,280\nI should now have a virtual drive\nattached, which I don't see.\n\n177\n00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,960\nLet me try that again.\n\n178\n00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,860\nWe're gonna find that Royal TSX dmg.\n\n179\n00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,420\nI'm gonna double click on that.\n\n180\n00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,800\nThere we go.\n\n181\n00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,090\nIt's gonna launch, and it's gonna\nshow up as a virtual hard drive.\n\n182\n00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,820\nAnd here it's actually launching\nits installer, which I've\n\n183\n00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,750\nalready got the software installed so\nI don't need it to go too crazy.\n\n184\n00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,430\nBut it's opening it,\nit's checking the volume, and\n\n185\n00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,960\nthen right here, I see a folder.\n\n186\n00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,020\nAnd normally I would just drag this and\ndrop it right into applications and\n\n187\n00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,190\nthat would install it.\n\n188\n00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,000\nBut if you look at my desktop,\nI see it as a drive.\n\n189\n00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,130\nAnd if you look in my finder over here,\nit's showing up as a hard drive, as\n\n190\n00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,020\na removable drive, right, like a USB drive\nwould show up if I were to plug one in.\n\n191\n00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,410\nRight, here,\nI've got a USB drive sitting right here.\n\n192\n00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,206\nSo if I throw a USB drive on the system,\n\n193\n00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:32,140\nit's gonna pop up here in a moment,\nand it'll show up as a desktop icon.\n\n194\n00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,820\nAnd it will show up over here on\nthe left side as being a USB drive.\n\n195\n00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,780\nNo different from this image file, right?\n\n196\n00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,490\nThe difference, though, is that the image\nfile is not tied to a physical device like\n\n197\n00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,480\nthis USB drive that I just plugged into.\n\n198\n00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,630\nThe image file, instead is tied to\nthat .dmg file that I just downloaded,\n\n199\n00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,519\nall right?\n\n200\n00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,460\nThe .dmg file is much like an archive\nInside of it, it's got multiple files.\n\n201\n00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,830\nThese are the files inside of that DMG.\n\n202\n00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,590\nThe difference though,\nis that an image file doesn't compress.\n\n203\n00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,960\nRight?\nWhen we did that archive,\n\n204\n00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,030\nthat zip file earlier,\nit actually shrunk the content down.\n\n205\n00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,030\nA DMG isn't designed for that.\n\n206\n00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,110\nIt leaves the contents of the same ties.\n\n207\n00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:17,060\nSo, if this operating, this file here,\nit's 28.9 megabytes in size.\n\n208\n00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,400\nIf it was 30 megabytes in size on\nthe hard drive when I put it in the DMG,\n\n209\n00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,380\nit's still 30 megabits in size, all right?\n\n210\n00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,370\nBut it's a great way to bring\nsoftware in like this and\n\n211\n00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,180\nallow people to choose what\nthey wanna do with it.\n\n212\n00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,510\nI could drag it and drop it onto\napplications, that would work.\n\n213\n00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,010\nOr, whoops.\n\n214\n00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,140\nIt's warning me I've already\ngot this one in place.\n\n215\n00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,880\nSo it's not gonna be too happy with that.\n\n216\n00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,940\nI'm just gonna stop that, all right.\n\n217\n00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,670\nBut I could do that, or\nI could drag it and put it somewhere else.\n\n218\n00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,230\nMaybe I don't want it in\nmy application folder.\n\n219\n00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,910\nMaybe I want it somewhere else on\nthe hard drive, and I can drag it and\n\n220\n00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,470\nmove it there.\n\n221\n00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,650\nOr whatever.\nAll right?\n\n222\n00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,910\nThis applications folder right\nhere is the one available for\n\n223\n00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,440\nthe whole system, maybe I want it\nin my personal users applications.\n\n224\n00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,270\nI can just drag it and drop it there, too.\n\n225\n00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,738\nYou're gonna get all that flexibility.\n\n226\n00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:04,350\nNow the DMG files,\na lot of us use them all the time.\n\n227\n00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,775\nYou install the third party software,\nyou need it.\n\n228\n00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:07,580\nRight?\n\n229\n00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,360\nBut, most of us never create them.\n\n230\n00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,950\nWhen we create a zip, it was real easy.\n\n231\n00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,510\nWe just highlighted a bunch of files,\nwe Ctrl+Clicked on it, and\n\n232\n00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,100\nchose to compress the items.\n\n233\n00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,950\nThat made the zip file.\n\n234\n00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,270\nWe were done.\n\n235\n00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,068\nBut, making an image file like\nthis is a little more involved.\n\n236\n00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:25,480\nIf we wanna make an image file,\n\n237\n00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,720\nlike this, we actually have to create\nit using the Disk Utility, right.\n\n238\n00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,360\nThe Disk Utility can\ncreate these DMG files.\n\n239\n00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,530\nIt can make them and\n\n240\n00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,670\nwe can store data inside them and\nhave them available, right.\n\n241\n00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,420\nLet me show you that process.\n\n242\n00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:45,430\nIf I fire up my Disk Utility, I can come\nin here and I can create a new image and\n\n243\n00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,980\nyou'll see that button right\nhere at the top, New Image.\n\n244\n00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,410\nI'm gonna create a virtual hard drive.\n\n245\n00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,450\nAnd when I hit new image,\nit's gonna ask me about it.\n\n246\n00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,330\nI'm gonna put it on my desktop and\nI'm gonna call this one router backups.\n\n247\n00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,030\nSo, this is where I'll be\nstoring my router backups.\n\n248\n00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,370\nAll right?\n\n249\n00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,780\nI can then pick a name.\n\n250\n00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,790\nRight?\nNotice the name is just disk image but\n\n251\n00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,040\nI wanna call it router backups,\n\n252\n00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,510\nso I'm just gonna copy that and\npaste it down here.\n\n253\n00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,130\nI can pick a size.\n\n254\n00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,150\nNow what's up with that?\n\n255\n00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,440\nWhy would I pick a size?\n\n256\n00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,420\nWith the ZIP file, we didn't pick a size.\n\n257\n00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,860\nIt just grew based on the amount\nof data that was in there.\n\n258\n00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,210\nWell, here it's creating\na virtual hard drive, and\n\n259\n00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,040\nhard drives have a maximum size.\n\n260\n00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,980\nThey have a point where they become full.\n\n261\n00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,910\nSo when I create an image file,\nit's gonna have to have a maximum size,\n\n262\n00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,140\nand I need to pick it.\n\n263\n00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,050\nThat default of 100 MB.\n\n264\n00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,490\nThat's not terribly big.\n\n265\n00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,220\nWell, I've got those router configs and\n100 megs is more than enough for them, so\n\n266\n00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,150\nthat might be fine.\n\n267\n00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,310\nI might need to choose something much,\nmuch larger.\n\n268\n00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,650\nAnd you'll see, down here you can choose\ncustom and you can go as big as you want.\n\n269\n00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,570\nBut understand this, by default,\n\n270\n00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,420\nif I say the image is gonna be a 100 megs\nin size, it's going to be a 100 megs.\n\n271\n00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,994\nEven if it's completely empty,\n\n272\n00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:57,070\nit will still eat a 100 megs\nof space on the hard drive.\n\n273\n00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,220\nIt's not like a zip file that grows and\n\n274\n00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,280\nshrinks based on the data\nthat's inside it.\n\n275\n00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,380\nAn image file by default will\nconsume all the space we assign.\n\n276\n00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,990\nSo if I stick with a 100 megabytes,\nit's gonna make a 100 MB file.\n\n277\n00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,410\nSo I'm actually gonna\nrename this a little bit.\n\n278\n00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,310\nI'll call this Router Backups Fixed.\n\n279\n00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,330\nBecause this is a fixed size.\n\n280\n00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,070\nAll right, so I just want to remember,\nthis one's gonna be fixed at 100 MB,\n\n281\n00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,310\nall right?\n\n282\n00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,620\nBecause it's a hard drive,\nif we wanna copy data onto it,\n\n283\n00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,160\nwe've gotta format it,\nit has a be a volume.\n\n284\n00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,150\nAnd so we can pick the filesystem.\n\n285\n00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:35,120\nWe want it to be ExFAT or\nOSX Extended, whichever one we want.\n\n286\n00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,410\nI'll stick with Mac OS Extended.\n\n287\n00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,250\nThen the encryption.\n\n288\n00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,620\nYou can actually encrypt this with file\nvault just like a regular hard drive.\n\n289\n00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,660\nIt's a virtual hard drive but\nit's treated just like a regular one.\n\n290\n00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,150\nSo if you choose to go ahead and\ndo some encryption you can specify that.\n\n291\n00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,290\nYou can also partition it into\nmultiple partitions if you need it.\n\n292\n00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,890\nYou could choose to do a single partition,\nand if you do single partition,\n\n293\n00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,790\nyou can do APM, or MBR, or\nGUID, the GPT partitions.\n\n294\n00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,100\nYou can pick all the same stuff as\na regular hard drive, all right.\n\n295\n00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,210\nI'm just gonna leave it alone here.\n\n296\n00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,230\nI'll just do no encryption,\nno crazy maps or anything.\n\n297\n00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,590\nAnd then the image format,\nthe default is a read/write disc image.\n\n298\n00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,160\nAll right?\n\n299\n00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,220\nThat means, not only will people be\nable to read data from this image, but\n\n300\n00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,340\nthey'll be about to write to it.\n\n301\n00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,250\nThey can add things to it.\n\n302\n00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,942\nThat's how a normal hard drive would be.\n\n303\n00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:24,240\nAll right?\n\n304\n00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,030\nWell, If I don't want that.\n\n305\n00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,460\nIf I just want people to be able to read,\n\n306\n00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,860\nyou'll see that you got different\noptions and you're like DVD, CD master.\n\n307\n00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,170\nWhen you do that, you write to a DVD or\n\n308\n00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,910\nyou write to a CD and\nthen it doesn't change.\n\n309\n00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,140\nIt's effectively read only at that\npoint so I could specify that.\n\n310\n00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,632\nBut I want mine to be\nmore like a hard drive.\n\n311\n00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:43,700\nI wanna be able to put\nrouter backups in here and\n\n312\n00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,520\nthen pull them out when I need to.\n\n313\n00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,820\nSo I'll stick with this\nread write disk image.\n\n314\n00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,881\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate that.\n\n315\n00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:53,380\nAll right?\nIt's building that DMG file.\n\n316\n00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,880\nIt builds it, it mounts it like\na hard drive and then it formats it.\n\n317\n00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,660\nAnd so it just got a format.\n\n318\n00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,330\nAnd now it's in place.\n\n319\n00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,940\nAnd if I take a look at it,\nit's sitting right here on my desktop.\n\n320\n00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:13,590\nIf I pull up its info,\nI can see that it is 100MB in size.\n\n321\n00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,100\nIt's 100MB capacity.\n\n322\n00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,800\nRight now,\nit's saying incorrectly that it's\n\n323\n00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,640\ngot about 196MB of available [LAUGH] space\nin it, so that's a little bit wrong.\n\n324\n00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,670\nBut it's right there and\nit's showing up as a hard drive.\n\n325\n00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,623\nAnd if I want to put something in it,\nI just need to open it up and\n\n326\n00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:31,002\ncopy the data there.\n\n327\n00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:34,662\nSo if I want my router configs to be in\nthere, I can just drag them and drop them,\n\n328\n00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:36,510\nand now they're in there, all right?\n\n329\n00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,760\nOnce they're in there,\nthe file doesn't change in size,\n\n330\n00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,680\nthe file is already 100 megs.\n\n331\n00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,095\nI just put a very small\namount of data in there.\n\n332\n00:16:45,095 --> 00:16:49,026\nThat whole folder is\na whopping 30k in size, right,\n\n333\n00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:53,180\nit's a very small,\n53k on disk is what it says.\n\n334\n00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,550\nBut that's not gonna change the size of\nthis image file cuz it's already 100 megs,\n\n335\n00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,810\nall right.\n\n336\n00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,335\nEven if I start throwing bigger\nfiles in there and other things,\n\n337\n00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:03,125\nit's just gonna grow based on that, right.\n\n338\n00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:07,464\nSo If I were to throw like\nthe Royal TSX file that I downloaded,\n\n339\n00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:09,980\nlet me go find that one.\n\n340\n00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,357\nLet's see, that one went down in here.\n\n341\n00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:14,080\nSo, that was 18 megs, right?\n\n342\n00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,780\nSo, I'll go ahead and\nthrow that one in there.\n\n343\n00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,540\nSo it's gonna copy, and so\nnow it's 18 megs more data in there.\n\n344\n00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,340\nThat would be about 20% of the drive is,\nshould be consumed.\n\n345\n00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,390\nAnd when I take a look at its information,\nstill 100 megs.\n\n346\n00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,380\nNothing too special there.\n\n347\n00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,530\nNow, I treat it like a regular hard drive.\n\n348\n00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,900\nIf I'm done with it, I need to eject it.\n\n349\n00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,170\nAnd in the finder,\nI see if on the left side here as a drive.\n\n350\n00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,500\nSo I can eject it or\ndrag it to my trash and be done with it.\n\n351\n00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,990\nOnce it's disconnected,\nI can copy that DMG file anywhere.\n\n352\n00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,190\nI can copy it to anybody else's computer.\n\n353\n00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,620\nThey can double-click on it,\nand it'll mount it, right?\n\n354\n00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,256\nSo if I eject it, right,\nso that icon disappears,\n\n355\n00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:52,396\nI still have the actual\nDMG file right here.\n\n356\n00:17:52,396 --> 00:17:55,830\nAnd if I double-click on that,\nit'll mount it.\n\n357\n00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:00,450\nHere's the mounted version, and\nI'm browsing inside of that DMG file.\n\n358\n00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,040\nI'm browsing into it.\n\n359\n00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,370\nAnd there's the files that I copied,\nright?\n\n360\n00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,790\nOn a positive side, that makes it where\nwe have a disk that we can easily add and\n\n361\n00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,410\nremove data to and copy between computers.\n\n362\n00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,290\nIt gives you a lot of flexibility.\n\n363\n00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,050\nYou can encrypt,\n\n364\n00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,820\nyou can do all sorts of advanced\nthings you can't do with a ZIP file.\n\n365\n00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,180\nOn negative side, it's eating\nup a lot more space than normal.\n\n366\n00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,820\nWell, if I wanna forgo a little bit of\ncompatibility with earlier versions\n\n367\n00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,170\nof Mac OS, I can turn this into\nwhat's called a sparse disk.\n\n368\n00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,100\nAnd a sparse disk, or\nsometimes called a sparse bundle,\n\n369\n00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,590\na sparse disk will only consume the space\nfor the data that you put in it.\n\n370\n00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,684\nNow it actually does have a minimum,\n\n371\n00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,177\nthere's like a minimum\nsize that it can consume.\n\n372\n00:18:41,177 --> 00:18:44,580\nWhich I think is,\nif I remember right, it's about 30MB.\n\n373\n00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,330\nBut it has this minimum, but after\nthat it'll only consume the space for\n\n374\n00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,130\nthe data you throw inside of it.\n\n375\n00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,610\nSo when I made this Router Backups Fixed,\nit was 100MB, because that's\n\n376\n00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,623\nwhat I told it to be and it just took\nall of that space right here on day one.\n\n377\n00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,790\nBut if I go back into Disk Utility and\nI do a new image, and\n\n378\n00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,130\nI am gonna create another\none called Router Backups,\n\n379\n00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,080\nexcept I am gonna call this\none Router Backups Sparse.\n\n380\n00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:12,680\nAnd so I'm gonna come in and\n\n381\n00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,420\ndo the same basic settings\nthat I did before, all right.\n\n382\n00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,880\nThe size, I'll leave at 100MB,\njust like before.\n\n383\n00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,990\nBut down here at the bottom under\nImage Format, I'm gonna drop that down.\n\n384\n00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,600\nAnd see how I've got Sparse Bundle\nDisk Image and Sparse Disk Image.\n\n385\n00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,510\nWhen you get installation software,\n\n386\n00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,810\nthat installation software has an\napplication in it and it can run a script.\n\n387\n00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,530\nLike when I ran Royal TSX one,\n\n388\n00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,170\nremember the end user license\nagreement that came up, right?\n\n389\n00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,560\nThat was a sparse bundle disk image,\nit was able to run that extra stuff.\n\n390\n00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,550\nBut if I just want it to be a straight\nup disk, I can choose Sparse Disk Image.\n\n391\n00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,762\nAnd now it's gonna build the disk and\nonly consume the actual occupied space.\n\n392\n00:19:52,762 --> 00:19:57,550\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit Create, and\nlet it build that right on my desktop.\n\n393\n00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:03,080\nNow, my other file was a .dmg,\nthis one is actually .sparse.\n\n394\n00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,010\nSo it does have a different file\nextension on the end of it,\n\n395\n00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,410\nwhich is a little bit unique.\n\n396\n00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,420\nBut see how it's got like, .sparseimage?\n\n397\n00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,280\nYou can actually rename that .dmg and\nit works just fine.\n\n398\n00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,510\nA lot of people do that,\nthey just rename it .dmg.\n\n399\n00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,995\nBut here's the mount that it did for\nthe Router Backup Sparse.\n\n400\n00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:22,897\nAnd I can copy my configs in there, and\n\n401\n00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:29,190\nI can even copy things like that Royal TSX\ninstall or I can copy that in there.\n\n402\n00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,140\nSo now, these two disks have\nthe same exact data in them, right?\n\n403\n00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,150\nThey've got the same information.\n\n404\n00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,254\nIf I take a look at Router Backups Fixed\nand I pull up it's info,\n\n405\n00:20:38,254 --> 00:20:42,447\nI can see its capacity 100 megs,\nthat's the size that it is.\n\n406\n00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:47,034\nIf I take a look at Router Backups Sparse,\nit's 100 megs, right?\n\n407\n00:20:47,034 --> 00:20:50,900\nThey show as the same,\nthey both have that 100 megs of storage.\n\n408\n00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,888\nBut let's see how that\nlooks in the terminal.\n\n409\n00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:57,351\nIf I fire up my terminal and\nI get into my desktop,\n\n410\n00:20:57,351 --> 00:21:02,330\nhere's Router Backups Fixed,\nhere's Router Backups Sparse.\n\n411\n00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,103\nThe fixed disk is 98MB.\n\n412\n00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:09,010\nI told it it was 100MB,\nit laid out enough space for that.\n\n413\n00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,130\nThe sparse one though, is 25MB, okay.\n\n414\n00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,050\nIt's not the full 100, but\nit does have that minimum size and so\n\n415\n00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,890\nit's already consumed some of that,\nand it's at 25MB.\n\n416\n00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,760\nConsiderably smaller than\nthe other disk image,\n\n417\n00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,640\nconsuming less space than\nwhat was available with it.\n\n418\n00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,490\nAnd as I add more data to it,\nit'll continue to grow.\n\n419\n00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:32,030\nSo for example,\nif I were to take one of these files, and\n\n420\n00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,030\nlet's just change its name.\n\n421\n00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,960\nSo let's say I had another\nversion of that software.\n\n422\n00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,940\nSo here's another 18 megs that\nI just copied into it, right?\n\n423\n00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,197\nSo that file should have just grown.\n\n424\n00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:49,109\nAnd if I jump back in here and\ntake a look at it now, it was 25 megs,\n\n425\n00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:53,040\nnow it's 42 megs, right,\nstill considerably smaller.\n\n426\n00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,350\nI copied 18 megs of data into there,\nso it grew to encompass that.\n\n427\n00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,820\nAnd now, here we are half\nthe size of the other one.\n\n428\n00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,770\nSo a sparse disk image can\ntake up a lot less space.\n\n429\n00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,860\nThere's various reasons why you might\nwant to do one versus the other.\n\n430\n00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,970\nThe main thing centers\naround fragmentation.\n\n431\n00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,450\nWhen you do a sparse image,\n\n432\n00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,735\nit's always a little bit slower to access\ncuz the file can become fragmented.\n\n433\n00:22:13,735 --> 00:22:16,260\nVersus when you do\nthe fixed image like this,\n\n434\n00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,590\nthe regular one, the file will be\nall written nice and contiguous, so\n\n435\n00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,080\nit won't fragment and\nyou get better performance.\n\n436\n00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,490\nBut when you're talking\nabout installing software,\n\n437\n00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,650\nyou don't care about performance.\n\n438\n00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,586\nOr backing up little files,\nyou don't care about performance.\n\n439\n00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:30,950\nAnd so a sparse image can\nbe a lot more efficient.\n\n440\n00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,210\nSo just keep that in mind and\n\n441\n00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,540\nit's a decision you make\nwhen you create that file.\n\n442\n00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,190\nAll right, so if you wanna make\nyour own image files like this,\n\n443\n00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,158\nDisk Utility is the winner, right?\n\n444\n00:22:43,158 --> 00:22:45,850\nThat utility, it's right here, you got\nyour new image that you can create.\n\n445\n00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,720\nYou'll see where you can even convert\nan image into a different format.\n\n446\n00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,280\nSo if I wanted to take my original fixed\nimage, which actually it's probably gonna\n\n447\n00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,970\nbe mad about since it's mounted,\nlet me unmount those.\n\n448\n00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,770\nYou can only do so\nmuch with them when they are mounted.\n\n449\n00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,490\nSo I'll take that fixed image,\nand I can choose to convert it.\n\n450\n00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,470\nAnd when you convert it, here's where\nI can choose do I want it compressed,\n\n451\n00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,410\nread only, read write,\ndo I want to turn encryption on?\n\n452\n00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,740\nYou can start to modify those functions.\n\n453\n00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,230\nAnd if I choose to make it compressed, now\nI'll be able to get more data in there and\n\n454\n00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,372\nit'll take less space, and\nthen we'll be in business.\n\n455\n00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:24,075\nAnd so I can save that,\nwe'll let it replace.\n\n456\n00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:26,002\nSo there it goes creating that image.\n\n457\n00:23:26,002 --> 00:23:29,422\nAnd now I still have that\nRouter Backups Fixed, it's right there,\n\n458\n00:23:29,422 --> 00:23:30,993\nI can mount it and work with it.\n\n459\n00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:37,250\nBut, it's compressed now, so the data\ninside of it's gonna take less space.\n\n460\n00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,600\nSo, pretty easy to work with.\n\n461\n00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,650\nSimilar to a ZIP file,\nbut not as easy, right?\n\n462\n00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,560\nIt's really not as easy.\n\n463\n00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,763\nBut when you work with a DMG file, with\none of these images, you can copy data in\n\n464\n00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:51,920\nand out of that all you want and the file\ndoesn't really change all that much.\n\n465\n00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,361\nWith a ZIP file,\nevery time you copy something to it,\n\n466\n00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:59,120\nwhat it's actually doing is\nbuilding an all new ZIP file.\n\n467\n00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,210\nThrowing the old one away and renaming\nthe new one to match the old name.\n\n468\n00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,000\nIt's actually rebuilding\nthat file every time.\n\n469\n00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,991\nEvery time you add or\nremove something from a zip file,\n\n470\n00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:09,340\nthe entire file is rebuilt.\n\n471\n00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,612\nWith a DMG, every time you add or remove,\nit's just that file that changes,\n\n472\n00:24:13,612 --> 00:24:14,746\nnot the DMG itself.\n\n473\n00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,280\nSo it's a lot more efficient for\nthings that frequently change.\n\n474\n00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,530\nBut if I'm about to send somebody\nsome photos, that's a one time thing.\n\n475\n00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,360\nI need it to be quick, easy, and small.\n\n476\n00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,670\nZip files work out great, right?\n\n477\n00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,250\nSo, when it comes to building archives and\nimages, they both have their place.\n\n478\n00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,800\nFor most people,\nzip files are perfectly fine.\n\n479\n00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,850\nIt's native in the OS.\n\n480\n00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,790\nIt's supported by every other OS.\n\n481\n00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,650\nIt's the way to go, right?\n\n482\n00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,000\nBut if you're a software developer\nthat's gonna be deploying software or\n\n483\n00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,120\nif you're an IT guy and you wanna push out\na package of software out to your systems,\n\n484\n00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,460\nDMG files allow us to do that and\n\n485\n00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,350\neasily make changes without having\nto rewrite that whole file.\n\n486\n00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,070\nDefinitely some neat stuff there.\n\n487\n00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,840\nSo, take advantage of that,\nyou know it's part of the OS.\n\n488\n00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,370\nI didn't have to load any crazy\nthird party software for that.\n\n489\n00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,120\nNow I did mention in the beginning of the\nshow, I was running that Entropy Software.\n\n490\n00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,600\nAnd the reason I have that, Entropy,\nit's a third party software.\n\n491\n00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,420\nIt's just an archiver,\nand the reason I run it,\n\n492\n00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,530\nis I do get a lot of\nfiles in other formats.\n\n493\n00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:16,360\nI have people send me that are 7Zip or\nRAR, things like that.\n\n494\n00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,190\nAnd I can't open them normally cuz\nApple doesn't have support for those.\n\n495\n00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,380\nSo third party archivers\nlike this have a place, but\n\n496\n00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,790\nyou don't necessarily need them.\n\n497\n00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,420\nBetween the zips and the DMGs that you can\nmake in the base OS, that accounts for\n\n498\n00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,130\nmost people's needs.\n\n499\n00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,890\nAll right.\n\n500\n00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,390\nWell that's about all I've got for\narchives and images.\n\n501\n00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,020\nLet me see if I've got anything else\nI want to throw in on that one.\n\n502\n00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,360\nYeah, that's about it.\n\n503\n00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,860\nYeah.\n\n504\n00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,140\nThat's really about it.\n\n505\n00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,450\nDo remember that with zip files,\nthey don't mount.\n\n506\n00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,430\nYou just double click on them and\nthey extract.\n\n507\n00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,640\nBut with the DMG files they do mount.\n\n508\n00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,790\nAnd so,\nif you're gonna be making changes to them\n\n509\n00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,720\nbefore you copy it to\nsend it to somebody else.\n\n510\n00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,840\nYou need to unmount it to make\nsure your changes are done.\n\n511\n00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,330\nAnd then you can send\nthe DMG off to somebody else,\n\n512\n00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,330\nor copy it to a network share or whatever.\n\n513\n00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,837\nBut just make sure you do that.\n\n514\n00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:06,990\nOtherwise, they function like\nnormal hard drives and that's that.\n\n515\n00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,140\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\n\n516\n00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,050\nthat's about all I've got on\nfile archives and images.\n\n517\n00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,360\nSo let's wrap it up here.\n\n518\n00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,640\nLet me remind you guys if you have\nquestions on any of this stuff,\n\n519\n00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,530\nlive

evening and\n\n4\n00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:36,771\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,880\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n6\n00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,150\nback again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n7\n00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,470\nToday's a pretty exciting episode, cuz\nwe're jumping into a technology that is\n\n8\n00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,620\njust downright good stuff that\neverybody should be using.\n\n9\n00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,450\nAnd what I'm talking\nabout is Time Machine.\n\n10\n00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,470\nTime Machine is backup software\nthat's built into Mac OS.\n\n11\n00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,820\nDoesn't cost you any extra.\n\n12\n00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,810\nIt's part of that base operating system.\n\n13\n00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,710\nAnd let me tell you, it's one of the best\nback up solutions that's out there right\n\n14\n00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,430\nnow, not just for Mac, but really for any\nplatform, but it happens to be Mac only.\n\n15\n00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,400\nAll right, now,\nwhy is backing up important?\n\n16\n00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,280\nIt should probably be common sense, but we\nstore a lot of data on our computers and\n\n17\n00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,640\nthat data is typically\nstored on our hard drive.\n\n18\n00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,270\nThat hard drive might be\na magnetic spinning drive,\n\n19\n00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,000\nit might be a solid state digital drive.\n\n20\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,870\nBut, either way you're lucky to get a good\n\n21\n00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,210\nthree years out of\na hard drive these days.\n\n22\n00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,450\nIf you can get five years,\nyou're above the curve on that.\n\n23\n00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,310\nIt's pretty uncommon to even\ngo five years on a hard drive.\n\n24\n00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,260\nIf you have a laptop, it's even more\nlikely that you're gonna have a hard drive\n\n25\n00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,800\nfailure just because you shake,\nyou move the laptop.\n\n26\n00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,610\nIt gets jostled around a good bit.\n\n27\n00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,370\nOn a desktop, a hard drive\nmight last a bit longer, right.\n\n28\n00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,650\nWhen that drive does fail,\nwhat happens to your data?\n\n29\n00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,280\nYour data's gone!\n\n30\n00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280\nYou're data's inaccessible.\n\n31\n00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,410\nYou can't get to it.\n\n32\n00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,360\nAnd let me tell you,\n\n33\n00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,590\nif this has never happened to you before,\nit has happened to me.\n\n34\n00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,840\nAnd you get this sinking feeling\nin your gut, you're like, oh no.\n\n35\n00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,610\nI just lost my Data.\n\n36\n00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,250\nAnd if it's stuff like documents,\nemails, that kind of stuff.\n\n37\n00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,730\nYou can make those again.\n\n38\n00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,940\nThat's not a big deal.\n\n39\n00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,810\nBut if you lose your family photos,\ndocuments like that.\n\n40\n00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,990\nThose are things that you can't re-create.\n\n41\n00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:19,950\nIt's really important to make sure that\nwe have them stored two different places.\n\n42\n00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,630\nWell the old way of doing it,\n\n43\n00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,660\nold being like five years ago,\nit's not that terribly long ago.\n\n44\n00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,070\nThe old way of doing it was\nto use back up software and\n\n45\n00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,670\nback up to tape or DVD or\nsomething like that.\n\n46\n00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,190\nIt was a manual process.\n\n47\n00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,060\nYou had to remember to\nchange out the media.\n\n48\n00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,020\nPut in new tapes or\nput in new DVDs to back up to them.\n\n49\n00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,320\nAnd when it came time to restore, you\nhad to go and dig up the right tapes or\n\n50\n00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,130\nthe right DVDs to be able to find\nyour data and bring it back.\n\n51\n00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,890\nIt was a manual process so\nit counted on us to be involved.\n\n52\n00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,560\nAnd, unfortunately,\nmost of us don't care about backups.\n\n53\n00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,360\nSo, they don't get done.\n\n54\n00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,760\nAnd, it's not until you have a failure\nthat you really wish you had one.\n\n55\n00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,020\nSo, what Apple did is that they set\nout to make things as easy as possible\n\n56\n00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,460\nto have backups that ran without\nyou having to think about it.\n\n57\n00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,130\nAnd, to do that they created Time Machine.\n\n58\n00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,520\nNow what Time Machine does is it runs\nin the background on your Mac, and\n\n59\n00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,850\nit backs up your data periodically.\n\n60\n00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,640\nBy default, it's actually backing\nup your data once an hour.\n\n61\n00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,450\nBacks it up very, very often.\n\n62\n00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,720\nAnd then it can back up to\na couple different places.\n\n63\n00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,440\nYou can backup to a second\nhard drive in your computer.\n\n64\n00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,340\nSo if you have like a Mac Pro\nwith some extra room,\n\n65\n00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,860\nyou can stick a second hard drive\nin there and backup to that.\n\n66\n00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,540\nThat will work out fine or\n\n67\n00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,780\nyou could backup to something\nlike an external hard drive.\n\n68\n00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,540\nYou might have a USB 3.0 or\n\n69\n00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,220\na FireWire hard drive lying around,\nyou could do USB 2.0 or even 1.1,\n\n70\n00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,040\nit's just going to be slow so it will take\na lot longer to backup to those disks.\n\n71\n00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,910\nBacking up to an external disk like this\nis nice because if your computer dies,\n\n72\n00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,770\nyou can take this external disk,\nget a new computer, hook this up and\n\n73\n00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,610\nrestore your data to the new computer.\n\n74\n00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,850\nNo problem, right?\n\n75\n00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,970\nExternal media like this is\ninexpensive these days and\n\n76\n00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,560\na great way to recover that data.\n\n77\n00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,420\nNow sometimes you want something that\ndoesn't require even that much thought.\n\n78\n00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,330\nThe problem with removable media like this\nis when I get home at the end of the day,\n\n79\n00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,510\nI've got to plug it in.\n\n80\n00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,690\nIf this isn't plugged in,\nmy backup doesn't happen.\n\n81\n00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,400\nSo if I forget to plug this in,\nnow I'm not backing up.\n\n82\n00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,200\nSo Apple made it where you can\nback up over the network, also.\n\n83\n00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,950\nYou can back up to\na Time Capsule if you have one.\n\n84\n00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,310\nIf you've never seen a Time Capsule,\nlet me just pull this up here real quick.\n\n85\n00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,180\nIt's a really neat device from Apple.\n\n86\n00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,770\nIt's actually a wireless access point.\n\n87\n00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,910\nSo it's one of their\nAirports access points.\n\n88\n00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,330\nYou stick it in your home to\nbuild a wireless network.\n\n89\n00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,320\nBut they stuck a couple\nof hard drives in it.\n\n90\n00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,130\nSo it can have two or\nthree terabytes of storage and\n\n91\n00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,700\nyou can back up your laptops and\ndesktops up to that.\n\n92\n00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,150\nYou don't even have to think about it.\n\n93\n00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,590\nYou just go home and\nturn the computer on and\n\n94\n00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,890\nyou'll see it over the wireless network\nand start backing up your data.\n\n95\n00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,320\nVery, very cool.\n\n96\n00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,900\nIf you don't have an AirPort like this,\nbut you do have another Mac,\n\n97\n00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,010\nas long as you have the Mac OS X Server\nsoftware installed on it,\n\n98\n00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,060\nyou can create a shared folder, and you'll\nbe able to do a time machine backup over\n\n99\n00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,410\nthe network to that other Mac, all right?\n\n100\n00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,560\nIt does require the Mac OS X Server piece,\nit won't do it just on a regular Mac OS.\n\n101\n00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,900\nBut assuming you've got that,\nyou can do the back of this.\n\n102\n00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,360\nServer software's only 20 bucks.\n\n103\n00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,190\nSo, it's very inexpensive\nto throw on there.\n\n104\n00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,745\nBut even here, the time capsule,\n\n105\n00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:20,430\n$300 in exchange for not having\nto worry about losing your data?\n\n106\n00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,190\nThat's worth it.\n\n107\n00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,600\nYou know, our personal data, our business\ndata, that stuff's really important.\n\n108\n00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,415\nYou don't want to lose it.\n\n109\n00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:29,010\n$300, if you actually had a failure,\nyou would gladly\n\n110\n00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,030\npay $300 to get that data back, so\nit's really not that big of a deal.\n\n111\n00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,110\nAll right, so pretty cool stuff there,\nneat things that we can do to backup.\n\n112\n00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,520\nHow do we get this set up?\n\n113\n00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,710\nWell that's the real\nglory of time machine,\n\n114\n00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,440\nApple set out to make this super easy.\n\n115\n00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,670\nIf you have a second hard drive,\nlike this USB drive, or\n\n116\n00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,590\na second hard drive in your computer\nlike the one I'm about to do.\n\n117\n00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:56,650\nThe first time you plug it in, you'll get\na pop-up box on the screen that'll say,\n\n118\n00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,980\ndo you want to use this drive for\nTime Machine?\n\n119\n00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,260\nAnd you can say, no, or you can say, yes.\n\n120\n00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,840\nAnd if you say yes, it's gonna go\nahead and format the drive and\n\n121\n00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,510\nget it set up for Time Machine,\nand you'll be ready to go.\n\n122\n00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,360\nThat's it.\n\n123\n00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,420\nAny end user can do that.\n\n124\n00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,130\nThey plug in a drive,\nthey hit enable, done, all right.\n\n125\n00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,200\nBut, we can also go in and\nconfigure it ourselves if we wanted.\n\n126\n00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,530\nWe don't have to rely on those little\nwizards to get this stuff setup.\n\n127\n00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,560\nBut it's pretty straightforward, and you\ncan even do Time Machine backups to more\n\n128\n00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,510\nthan one destination if you want, so\nyou can throw it into different areas.\n\n129\n00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,660\nThere's a lot of flexibility there too,\nit's really pretty cool.\n\n130\n00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,380\nLet's walk to that process\nof getting things set up.\n\n131\n00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,610\nSo in this computer I\nhave two hard drives.\n\n132\n00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,360\nAnd you see I've got this second\nhard drive sitting right here, and\n\n133\n00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,710\nI want to use that for time machine.\n\n134\n00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:42,510\nNow if you just have one hard drive,\nyou actually can partition it in half and\n\n135\n00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,810\nput your time machine on\nthat second partition.\n\n136\n00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,110\nBut it's a bad idea.\n\n137\n00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,510\nAll right, that will help protect you\nfrom things like accidental deletions.\n\n138\n00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,120\nIf I deleted a file by accident it\nwill be on that back up partition.\n\n139\n00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,780\nBut it won't help me with\na physical hard drive failure.\n\n140\n00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,630\nIf my physical hard drive fails,\nI lose all of the partitions on it.\n\n141\n00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,940\nYou never lose just one partition,\nyou lose all the partitions on that drive.\n\n142\n00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,660\nSo it's always better to\nhave a second physical disk,\n\n143\n00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,675\neither internal or external.\n\n144\n00:07:09,675 --> 00:07:13,310\nExternal could firewire, USB,\nwhatever, it doesn't matter.\n\n145\n00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,300\nYou'll be able to back up to it.\n\n146\n00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,050\nAll right, now, when I connected this,\nI did actually get that\n\n147\n00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,940\nmessage that asked me if I wanted to do an\nenable or disable but I just canceled it.\n\n148\n00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,920\nIf you want to see it, a good way to bring\nit back up is just to format the drive.\n\n149\n00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,540\nIf I fire up my disk utility and\nI erase that disk.\n\n150\n00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,500\nSo here is.\nThis is my back up disk.\n\n151\n00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,280\nRight?\n\n152\n00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,470\nI can come in here, and\nI can repartition it.\n\n153\n00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,660\nSo I'll tell it I'm going to do\none partition on this disk and\n\n154\n00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,645\nI'll call it my back up disk.\n\n155\n00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:43,985\nNow, you do need to have it\nformatted Mac OS extended.\n\n156\n00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:47,833\nIt needs that for time machine to function\nproperly, so it can't be x fat or\n\n157\n00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,371\nfat 32 or any of those guys.\n\n158\n00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:50,346\nSo, you do have to format it that way.\n\n159\n00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:54,839\nBut then once you've formatted and erased\nit, there it goes, it's gonna format,\n\n160\n00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,462\nit'll see it as a new disk and\nI should get that pop up message again.\n\n161\n00:07:58,462 --> 00:08:00,284\nI say should.\n\n162\n00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:02,781\nI'm glad I said should because I'm\nnot getting the pop-up message.\n\n163\n00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:06,764\n[LAUGH] You'll normally see that pop-up\nmessage come up asking you if you want to\n\n164\n00:08:06,764 --> 00:08:08,410\nenable Time Machine.\n\n165\n00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,020\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n166\n00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,810\nWe don't need the pop-up to turn it on.\n\n167\n00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,600\nWe can always just go into the system\npreferences, and get it there too.\n\n168\n00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,173\nIt's probably because I\ndidn't change the name.\n\n169\n00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:18,452\nAll right.\nSo, I'm going to go up here\n\n170\n00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:21,417\ninto my system preferences, and\ninside of the system preferences,\n\n171\n00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,250\nyou'll have a system preference for\nTime Machine.\n\n172\n00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,090\nNow we can just jump right\ninto Time Machine and\n\n173\n00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,570\nit's going to offer to let\nus turn on Time Machine.\n\n174\n00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,340\nNow we need to select\na back up disk first.\n\n175\n00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,520\nAnd that's what that pop-up screen is\ndoing the first time you attach a new\n\n176\n00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,610\ndrive.\n\n177\n00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,130\nSo in my case,\nI'm just gonna hit Select Backup Disk, and\n\n178\n00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,060\nthen I'll get a pick from my hard drives.\n\n179\n00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,950\nNow I've got that Backup Disk,\nit's a local drive.\n\n180\n00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,950\nIt's about 500 gigs in size.\n\n181\n00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,320\nI've also got Other Airport Time Capsule.\n\n182\n00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,470\nSo if I had a time capsule on the network,\nI could point to that.\n\n183\n00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,520\nAnd if I had a server on the network,\nit would have spotted that, and\n\n184\n00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,210\nthat would be in the list also.\n\n185\n00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,970\nI don't have a server.\n\n186\n00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,620\nSo it doesn't show up.\n\n187\n00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,790\nBut I can choose back up disk.\n\n188\n00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,910\nAnd when I choose that,\nI can hit use disk.\n\n189\n00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,560\nAnd it's gonna turn on Time Machine and\nit's gonna start running.\n\n190\n00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,210\nIt's that easy.\n\n191\n00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,180\nBut there is another option right here\non the screen that's kind of useful.\n\n192\n00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,390\nEncrypt backups.\n\n193\n00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,400\nI'm backing up to an internal disk.\n\n194\n00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,180\nSo, nobody's going to\nsteal that internal disk.\n\n195\n00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,460\nThey would just steal the whole computer.\n\n196\n00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,140\nAnd if they steal the whole computer,\nthey've got my regular hard drive anyway,\n\n197\n00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,440\nso there's not a whole lot of need for\nme to encrypt this backup, right?\n\n198\n00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,730\nOr, maybe I am encrypting the other drive,\ntoo, it would make sense to encrypt this.\n\n199\n00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,090\nBut, where the encryption option is\nreally important is a removable disk.\n\n200\n00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,060\nI could leave this on an airplane.\n\n201\n00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,530\nSomebody could walk up to my desk at\nnight and steal it off of my desk.\n\n202\n00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,470\nThat would be a problem, right?\n\n203\n00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,340\nIf I lose this disk and\nthey take it somewhere and plug it in,\n\n204\n00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,380\nwhat do they have?\n\n205\n00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,100\nThey have all of my data.\n\n206\n00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,740\nEverything is right on this drive.\n\n207\n00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,880\nI don't want that getting out there.\n\n208\n00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,150\nRight?\nI don't want somebody to be able to get at\n\n209\n00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,360\nmy information.\n\n210\n00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,550\nSo it's important to encrypt it.\n\n211\n00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,640\nIf you choose to encrypt it,\nyou'll have to provide a password.\n\n212\n00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,710\nAll right?\nThat password will be the private key\n\n213\n00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,290\nfor that drive.\n\n214\n00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,250\nYou'll need it to decrypt and\naccess that drive.\n\n215\n00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,380\nIf you lose that password,\nthere's no way to recover it.\n\n216\n00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,440\nThere's no recovery system for the\npassword key on that time machine drive.\n\n217\n00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,220\nSo if you lose it,\nthose backups are no longer valid.\n\n218\n00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,070\nEven if you take it down to\nthe Apple store, the genius bar, or\n\n219\n00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,510\nwhatever, those guys can't\ndo anything about it either.\n\n220\n00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,740\nIt's a secured password,\nyou've got to remember it.\n\n221\n00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,280\nI'm not going to encrypt this one,\nI'm just going to choose the backup disk.\n\n222\n00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,161\nAnd hit Use Disk.\n\n223\n00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:27,180\nAll right.\n\n224\n00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,530\nIt's going to flag that drive\nas a Time Machine drive.\n\n225\n00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,850\nNow, if this were a USB drive, USB drives\nnormally show up with a yellow icon.\n\n226\n00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,550\nAnd, what will happen,\nonce they're flagged for\n\n227\n00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,690\nTime Machine, the icon will change to\nthis green with a little clock on it.\n\n228\n00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,160\nI'm using an internal disk though, and\n\n229\n00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,350\nif I remember right the internal\ndisk icon doesn't change.\n\n230\n00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,530\nSo, it won't change to show\nthat it's Time Machine.\n\n231\n00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,020\nBut I've named it backup disk so\nI can at least remember.\n\n232\n00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,080\nIt then started a timer, a timer of\nabout 120 seconds or two minutes,\n\n233\n00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,460\nsaying we'll do that first backup in two\nminutes, and it's counting down now.\n\n234\n00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,420\nWhen it runs the backup,\n\n235\n00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,140\nthe very first backup you run is\na complete backup of your system.\n\n236\n00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,140\nSo if I look at my hard drive, for\nexample, I can see that right now I'm\n\n237\n00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,300\nusing about ten gigs of space,\nten gigs of space on disk.\n\n238\n00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,420\nSo my first back up is going\nto be ten gigs of storage.\n\n239\n00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,730\nWell that's a 500 gig drive.\n\n240\n00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,980\n549 gigs apparently so\nplenty of room on their.\n\n241\n00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,680\nIf I put ten gigs of data,\nI've got a lot of empty space.\n\n242\n00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,440\nWell what does it do\nwith all the extra space?\n\n243\n00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,270\nOne of Apple's recommendations is that\nyou only use the disk for Time Machine.\n\n244\n00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,140\nDon't use it for anything else.\n\n245\n00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,080\nRight?\n\n246\n00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,920\nI'll tell you from my own experience,\nyou can.\n\n247\n00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,130\nYou can put other data on\nthe Time Machine disk, it won't stop you.\n\n248\n00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,070\nBut it takes away space from the back up,\nright?\n\n249\n00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,540\nWhy do we need that space?\n\n250\n00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,170\nWell, Time Machine is gonna\nback up once an hour.\n\n251\n00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,450\nFor 24 hours.\n\n252\n00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,850\nSo, for the last 24 hours\nI'm gonna have 24 backups,\n\n253\n00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,980\none each hour for the last day.\n\n254\n00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,540\nThen, it's gonna have daily back ups for\nthe last month.\n\n255\n00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,780\nOne back up every day for\nthe last 31 days.\n\n256\n00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:11,370\nAnd then, it's going to have weekly\nback ups for all previous months.\n\n257\n00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,560\nWhat does that mean?\n\n258\n00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,900\nWell, it's going to save as many backups\nas it can, until the hard drive is full.\n\n259\n00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,770\nWhen the hard drive is full, it will\ndelete the oldest backup to make room for\n\n260\n00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,300\nthe newest backup.\n\n261\n00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,600\nSo the more space you have,\nthe further back in time you can go.\n\n262\n00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,910\nI might have a computer\nthat's two years old and\n\n263\n00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,740\nas long as I didn't fill up my backup hard\ndrive, I'll have Time Machine backups\n\n264\n00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,800\nall the way back to the first\nday that I owned that machine.\n\n265\n00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,230\nBut if the Time Machine hardware fills up,\n\n266\n00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,850\nit's got to clear out those\nold backups to make room.\n\n267\n00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,240\nNow, it is really, really efficient\nto do backups with Time Machine.\n\n268\n00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,100\nBecause what it does is this\nfirst backup will be ten gigs.\n\n269\n00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,230\nRight?\nIt's gonna backup ten\n\n270\n00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,060\ngigabytes of data and that's gonna take\nup a good space on that hard drive.\n\n271\n00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:03,410\nBut after that, every time it backs up,\nit's only gonna back up what's changed.\n\n272\n00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,430\nHow much of your data changes?\n\n273\n00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,640\nWell, my hard drive has\nten gigs of data on it.\n\n274\n00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,550\nThe majority of that is Mac OS.\n\n275\n00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,760\nIt's my default install of Mac OS.\n\n276\n00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,610\nYou know, am I changing that every day?\n\n277\n00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,360\nNo.\nI'm changing my personal data\n\n278\n00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,980\nmy personal data might be a very,\nvery small subset of that information.\n\n279\n00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,720\nWell, Time Machine is gonna back that\nup as I make changes to it, right?\n\n280\n00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,890\nOnce an hour as I make changes.\n\n281\n00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,590\nThe rest of the data it\nonly maintains one copy of.\n\n282\n00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:32,100\nSo my first backup might\nbe ten gigs in size,\n\n283\n00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,670\nmy next backup might\nonly be 100 megabytes.\n\n284\n00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,240\nIt might only be 50 megabytes.\n\n285\n00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,510\nAnd that means I can get\na ton of backups there.\n\n286\n00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:44,090\nJust as an example,\nmy laptop has a 512 gig SSD in it.\n\n287\n00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,280\nThat's why I got my laptop.\n\n288\n00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,450\nI back up to a hard drive\nthat's identical to this one.\n\n289\n00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,830\nIt's sitting on my desk back there.\n\n290\n00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,280\nI have it attached to a docking station,\nso at the end of the day I take my laptop\n\n291\n00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,610\nand I throw it in the docking station,\nso it automatically sees that drive and\n\n292\n00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,300\nit backs up its data that hard\ndrive is one terabyte in size.\n\n293\n00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:06,140\nI got my laptop about nine months ago, so\nI've had this laptop about nine months,\n\n294\n00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,530\nand I can go to that one\nterabyte hard drive and\n\n295\n00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,150\nit has all of my data all the way back\nto the first day I had this computer.\n\n296\n00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:17,900\nIt's all there even after I upgraded\nfrom Mavericks to Yosemite,\n\n297\n00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,860\nit's got my backups.\n\n298\n00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,330\nIt's got that information there.\n\n299\n00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,710\nAnd it hasn't had to overwrite yet.\n\n300\n00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,260\nI've got a 512 gig drive,\nthe backup drive's only a terrabyte.\n\n301\n00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,720\nThat doesn't mean I can\nonly have two backups.\n\n302\n00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,270\nI have hundreds of\nbackups on there because\n\n303\n00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,050\nit's just backing up what's changed.\n\n304\n00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,750\nThat's really important, all right?\n\n305\n00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,970\nBut this first backup will take\nthe longest time, so I need to wait and\n\n306\n00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,300\nlet it do its thing.\n\n307\n00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,670\nNow I got some comments in the chat\nroom about these initial backups.\n\n308\n00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,910\nIt can take a little while to run.\n\n309\n00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,270\nYou gotta let it just do its\nthing here this first time.\n\n310\n00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,820\nYou can continue to work on\nthe computer while it's doing this.\n\n311\n00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,140\nIt's running a backup, but you know what,\nI can fire up my web browser,\n\n312\n00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,810\nI can continue to use the machine.\n\n313\n00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,710\nTime Machine runs in the background.\n\n314\n00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:06,630\nI don't need it to stop and just walk\naway from the computer while it back up,\n\n315\n00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,360\nit's perfectly happy, I can get out\nthere browse some web sites and\n\n316\n00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,830\nthen do whatever it is that I want to do,\nand it's fine, right.\n\n317\n00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,610\nIt's backing everything up.\n\n318\n00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,280\nThat's the other nice\nthing about Time Machine.\n\n319\n00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,670\nYou turn it on and\nyou just forget about it.\n\n320\n00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,510\nYou just let it run, and that's it.\n\n321\n00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,270\nAnd as long as that external drive or\ninternal drive, as long as that AirPort,\n\n322\n00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,160\nthe Time Capsule,\n\n323\n00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,530\nas long as that's available, you'll\nbe doing these backups automatically.\n\n324\n00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,760\nNow if you turn your laptop off.\n\n325\n00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,490\nIt's not going to back up, is it?\n\n326\n00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,900\nWell, there is actually\na way to make it do that.\n\n327\n00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,130\nThere's a couple of neat advanced\nfeatures that are inside a Time Machine\n\n328\n00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,614\nthat we can manipulate to\nchange the way that it behaves.\n\n329\n00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:46,865\nBut what I wanna do is I want to let this\nbackup finish before I jump into some of\n\n330\n00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:48,275\nthose advanced features.\n\n331\n00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:50,145\nSo let's do this.\nLet's stop here and take a break, and\n\n332\n00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:52,354\nI'm gonna let this backup\nfinish during the break.\n\n333\n00:15:52,354 --> 00:15:54,476\nIt's already halfway done, so I'll just\nlet it finish the rest of the way.\n\n334\n00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:58,985\nAnd once it's done we'll take a look\nat some of the different things that we\n\n335\n00:15:58,985 --> 00:16:00,690\ncan do in Time Machine.\n\n336\n00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,700\nSo of the advanced functionality that\nit's got and some of the cooler things.\n\n337\n00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,780\nWe'll also take a look at how\nwe can restore our system\n\n338\n00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,160\nfrom those Time Machine backups.\n\n339\n00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,646\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n340\n00:16:13,646 --> 00:16:19,459\n[SOUND] All right welcome back everybody.\n\n341\n00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:22,000\nSo during the break my backup finished.\n\n342\n00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,080\nIt didn't take all that terribly long, and\n\n343\n00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,320\nif I look at my Time Machine output I\ncan see it's giving me a message here.\n\n344\n00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,410\nBackup complete, Time Machine has\nfinished the first backup to backup disk.\n\n345\n00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,570\nGreat, I've got a backup, wonderful.\n\n346\n00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,000\nAnd it actually did change my icon.\n\n347\n00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,400\nNotice my backup disk now\nhas a Time Machine icon.\n\n348\n00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,130\nIt won't get that until it has at least\none complete back up on the disk.\n\n349\n00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,010\nAnd so it's letting me know now,\nthat that is my backup disk.\n\n350\n00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,630\nNow, it's not exclusive,\nI could just crack that thing open,\n\n351\n00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,200\nand start to throw my back ups in here.\n\n352\n00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,835\nSee all the backups get put in a folder.\n\n353\n00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:57,180\nBackups.backup.db.\n\n354\n00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,480\nI can put other data on\nthis drive if I wanted to.\n\n355\n00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,380\nJust remember that you're taking away\nspace from the backups that it stores.\n\n356\n00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:12,945\nNow looking at this screen I can see that\nI have 540GB available out of 549GB total.\n\n357\n00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:16,315\nSo that means the backup only took\nabout ten gigs, or nine gigs of space.\n\n358\n00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:20,435\nI've got plenty of room on this drive for\nmore backups.\n\n359\n00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:23,145\nAnd I can see my next backup\nis scheduled for 3:48 PM,\n\n360\n00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:25,735\nwhich is about 38 minutes from now.\n\n361\n00:17:25,735 --> 00:17:29,705\nSo that backup is gonna run again and\nit will continue to run every hour, for\n\n362\n00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:31,340\nthe next 24 hours.\n\n363\n00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,360\nAs long as I keep my computer on and I\nkeep this other drive present, all right.\n\n364\n00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,370\nIf I disconnect that drive,\nit'll stop running back ups.\n\n365\n00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,580\nWell, there's actually a little\nsomething extra about that,\n\n366\n00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,810\na special type of backup we can do.\n\n367\n00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,930\nBut for right now, we'll just say\nthat we've gotta have that available.\n\n368\n00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,600\nNow we can turn Time Machine off at\nany time just by flipping this switch,\n\n369\n00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,900\nthat'll turn it off.\n\n370\n00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,220\nIt doesn't delete\nthe backups that it took,\n\n371\n00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,290\nit just stops new backups from happening.\n\n372\n00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,940\nSo you can always come and turn it back\non again later and continue to back up.\n\n373\n00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,470\nBut what I wanna show you guys\nis a few other little options.\n\n374\n00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,950\nThere's this nice little option right\nhere, Show Time Machine in the menu bar,\n\n375\n00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,060\nand I love that option.\n\n376\n00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,360\nI like to have Time Machine\nin my menu bar.\n\n377\n00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,280\nSo I almost always choose that.\n\n378\n00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,370\nThat made the little Time Machine\nicon appear right up here.\n\n379\n00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,110\nAnd the reason I like that is, when I plug\nin my laptop into its docking station, and\n\n380\n00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,090\nit sees its backup hard drive,\nit starts backing up.\n\n381\n00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,160\nBut it's in the background, you don't\nnecessarily know that it's happening.\n\n382\n00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,500\nI like to know it happened.\n\n383\n00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,160\nAnd you'll see when it's running,\nthis little icon spins a little bit.\n\n384\n00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,660\nAnd if you click on it,\nit'll show you the status.\n\n385\n00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,020\nWhen was the last backup?\n\n386\n00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,290\nWas it successful?\n\n387\n00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,630\nIs it backing up right now,\nhow far along is it?\n\n388\n00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,140\nIt'll tell you, right.\n\n389\n00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,790\nAnd see how I've got\nthe Back Up Now option.\n\n390\n00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,830\nSo if I know I haven't done a backup\nin a while I can hook up that drive and\n\n391\n00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,690\nsay oh, I wanna back up right now.\n\n392\n00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,910\nAnd you can click on that, and\nit's gonna start backing up, all right.\n\n393\n00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,850\nAnd that icon changed just a little bit,\nthere was a little arrow that appeared,\n\n394\n00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,160\nand there was kind that\nspin I was talking about.\n\n395\n00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,170\nAnd if you click on it, I can see\nthe latest backup was at 3:18 PM,\n\n396\n00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,200\nright now, it just did it.\n\n397\n00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,920\nSee how fast it went?\n\n398\n00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,960\nThe reason it went so\nfast is I haven't changed anything.\n\n399\n00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,270\nMy drive is basically the same as\nit was before I did that backup.\n\n400\n00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,330\nNow, that means that the backup\ndidn't have much work to do, and\n\n401\n00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,260\nit backed up really, really fast.\n\n402\n00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,110\nWell, let's say I was to do something.\n\n403\n00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,490\nMaybe I install some software, generate\nsome kind of changes on the drive, right.\n\n404\n00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:30,080\nSo maybe I go and download something like,\nlet's see, Royal TSX.\n\n405\n00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,790\nIt's some software that I\ndownloaded another episode.\n\n406\n00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,780\nIt's software that I use all the time so\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n407\n00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,000\ndownload that again.\n\n408\n00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,410\nAnd when we download that software,\nthat's a change to my hard drive.\n\n409\n00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,300\nI'll have new files that\nhave been downloaded.\n\n410\n00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,260\nWhoops, which I will try and download.\n\n411\n00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,045\nWhat am I doing?\n\n412\n00:19:48,045 --> 00:19:50,970\n[LAUGH] So anyhow, I'm gonna try and\ndownload the software.\n\n413\n00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,480\nAnd when we download it,\nit's extra stuff to be backed up, and so\n\n414\n00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,070\nnow it's gonna consume\nmore space on the disk.\n\n415\n00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,268\nSo, I'm looking for Royal TSX,\nthere it is, so we'll download that, and\n\n416\n00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,270\nthere we go.\n\n417\n00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,520\nSo it's downloading,\nlet me go in in my downloads folder, and\n\n418\n00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,280\nI'm just gonna make a few copies of that.\n\n419\n00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,570\nIt's gonna download and\nbe ready to backup.\n\n420\n00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,300\nNow, Time Machine doesn't\nbackup 100% of your drive.\n\n421\n00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300\nI know I said that in the first segment.\n\n422\n00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,940\nBut it actually does exclude some\nfiles that it considers junk files,\n\n423\n00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,050\nfiles that don't need to be backed up.\n\n424\n00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:25,630\nOn your Mac, you'll have a number of files\nthat are temporary files, cache files,\n\n425\n00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,500\nthings like that.\n\n426\n00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,910\nThings like your temporary internet cache,\n\n427\n00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,010\nwhere it's caching web\npages you've been to.\n\n428\n00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,280\nThat stuff doesn't need to be backed up,\nit's temporary.\n\n429\n00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,740\nThe thumbnail cache for\nyour pictures library.\n\n430\n00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,770\nIt can always regenerate thumbnails,\nwe don't care about those.\n\n431\n00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,810\nThat stuff doesn't get backed up, but\n\n432\n00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,310\nthings like your documents,\nyour downloads, the operating system.\n\n433\n00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,640\nThose things do get backed up.\n\n434\n00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,830\nAll the important stuff,\nstuff that we can't recreate.\n\n435\n00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,290\nSo it's backing that up, and\nthis is a download right now, so\n\n436\n00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,550\nI see it right here.\n\n437\n00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,700\nBut if I were to copy that and\ntake it to my documents folder and\n\n438\n00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:03,030\nstart pasting a few copies in there, so\nwe can just make a few copies of these.\n\n439\n00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,340\nThere we go.\n\n440\n00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,180\nYou know each one of these\nis 18 megs in size and so\n\n441\n00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,660\nI'm starting to consume more and more\nspace, each one of these dropping on here.\n\n442\n00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,230\nWhen I run my next backup,\nit's gonna have to back up all these.\n\n443\n00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,620\nAnd so if I go up here to Time Machine\nagain and I tell it to back up now,\n\n444\n00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,030\nit's gonna start running that backup,\nand there I could see it running.\n\n445\n00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,010\nAnd it still happened really,\nreally fast, because, well,\n\n446\n00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,880\nit just had to backup the changes.\n\n447\n00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,390\nThe rest of my hard drive hasn't changed.\n\n448\n00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,250\nThis is a real simple thing,\nit just backs those up and\n\n449\n00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,340\nnow they're incorporated in my backup too,\nall right.\n\n450\n00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,490\nSo, pretty neat there, pretty easy to do.\n\n451\n00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,040\nThat's why I like to turn on that little\nmenu bar item, so it's easy access.\n\n452\n00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,670\nWe also have other options, if I go\ndown to this Options button right here,\n\n453\n00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,130\nyou'll see a few other things\nthat we can customize,\n\n454\n00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,670\nlike Exclude items from the backups.\n\n455\n00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,640\nI mentioned how it automatically excludes\ncaches, right, these cache files,\n\n456\n00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,000\nthese temporary files that get generated,\nthere's no point in backing them up.\n\n457\n00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,590\nMaybe I say,\n\n458\n00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,350\nyou know what, my Downloads folder, I\ndon't need to back up a Downloads folder.\n\n459\n00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,710\nIt's just stuff I downloaded, I could\nalways re-download it from somewhere else.\n\n460\n00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,480\nI could come in here and\n\n461\n00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,320\nI could add that to my exclusion list,\nor maybe my shared folder.\n\n462\n00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,240\nI have a lot of users on my computer that\nstick stuff in the shared folder just\n\n463\n00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,840\nas temporary junk and\nI don't want to back that up.\n\n464\n00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,300\nWell, I could add that to this list.\n\n465\n00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,420\nAnd I could browse on the hard\ndrive to wherever that is and\n\n466\n00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,260\nexclude it from the backup, right.\n\n467\n00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,130\nSo those are all different things that we\ncould do if I had something that I wanted\n\n468\n00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,680\nto exclude or block out or whatever.\n\n469\n00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,100\nI could easily do that from\ninside of here, all right.\n\n470\n00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,130\nAnd notice in this little navigator here,\nI have the option to show invisible items.\n\n471\n00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,630\nThat's kinda nice because you might wanna\ninclude something that's a hidden folder.\n\n472\n00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,710\nFor example, the Library folder\ninside of my own profile.\n\n473\n00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,810\nThat's something that's kind\nof hidden by default and\n\n474\n00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,210\nso you might wanna exclude that and\nyou've got the option to do that.\n\n475\n00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,528\nWe have backup while on battery power.\n\n476\n00:22:58,528 --> 00:23:01,060\nWhat is that?\n\n477\n00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,310\nIn Mac OS Yosemite you have\nwhat's called a power nap.\n\n478\n00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,680\nWhen your system goes to sleep,\nit's normally off, right,\n\n479\n00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,500\nit goes to sleep and\nit wouldn't do something like a backup.\n\n480\n00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,490\nWell it can actually wake itself\nup to do a Time Machine backup,\n\n481\n00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,370\nif you want it to, all right.\n\n482\n00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,050\nAnd if you're on a battery,\n\n483\n00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:22,010\na lot of times you don't want it to backup\ncuz it's gonna drain too much battery.\n\n484\n00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,530\nRight, this is all about\nbattery conservation.\n\n485\n00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,950\nWell, I may want that.\n\n486\n00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,570\nI may want to do the backup\nregardless of whether I'm on power or\n\n487\n00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,580\nbattery because the backup is so\nimportant.\n\n488\n00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,720\nAnd so\nI could choose that option right there and\n\n489\n00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,290\nnow I'll back up regardless of whether I'm\nplugged into a wall socket or not, right.\n\n490\n00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,670\nYou have to make the decision on that.\n\n491\n00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,730\nFor me, if I'm running on battery,\nI'm not in my docking station.\n\n492\n00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,020\nI'm not attached to my hard\ndrive that I back up to, so\n\n493\n00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,490\nI don't want to back up while\nI'm on battery, but you might.\n\n494\n00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,730\nSo if you need that,\nyou can turn that option on.\n\n495\n00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,810\nAnd you've got notify after\nold backups are deleted.\n\n496\n00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:59,233\nIf the drive does get full and has to\nstart deleting the earlier backups to make\n\n497\n00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:02,243\nroom for new ones Well,\nyou want to know about that.\n\n498\n00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:05,900\nYou want to know that you've reached that\npoint, and it'll let you know, right.\n\n499\n00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,210\nNow, I mentioned power nap.\n\n500\n00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,460\nLet me show you that option.\n\n501\n00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,180\nThat option is actually not here\nin the Time Machine screen.\n\n502\n00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,450\nIf I go back to my System Preferences, and\n\n503\n00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,360\nI go into Energy Saver,\nit's in the Energy Saver that you'll see.\n\n504\n00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,950\nLet's see, where is it?\n\n505\n00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:26,870\nWell shoot, I thought it was right here\nthat we'd see the power nap setting.\n\n506\n00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,520\nAnd you know it might be cuz\nI'm in a virtual machine.\n\n507\n00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,600\nLet me go to my actual laptop here and\nI'll show you on it, and\n\n508\n00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,650\nwe'll go into the old energy saver.\n\n509\n00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,640\nThere we go.\n\n510\n00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,130\nSo, I was in a virtual machine a second\nago which is not truly on a battery, and\n\n511\n00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,620\nthat's why I wasn't seeing the option but\nthis is on my actual laptop here.\n\n512\n00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,800\nAnd so I just went into System Preferences\nand Energy Saver, and notice\n\n513\n00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,865\nthis option right here, Enable Power Nap\nwhile plugged into a power adapter.\n\n514\n00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,450\nIf my computer goes to sleep,\nit's in a low energy state.\n\n515\n00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:00,010\nBut it'll wake back up to\nuse Time Machine, right.\n\n516\n00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,310\nThat's what the little\nnote is saying here.\n\n517\n00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:06,170\nWhile sleeping your Mac can backup using\nTime Machine and periodically check for\n\n518\n00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,940\nnew email, calendar and\nother iCloud updates, right.\n\n519\n00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,540\nSo, it doesn't fully go to sleep,\nit partially,\n\n520\n00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,966\nit's like sleeping with one eye open,\nright.\n\n521\n00:25:13,966 --> 00:25:17,140\nJust so it can say I'm gonna take\na backup every so often and cover that.\n\n522\n00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,600\nSo that's tucked away under your\nEnergy Saver settings, right.\n\n523\n00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,650\nAnd I'm on my Power Adapter settings here,\nif I switch over to Battery,\n\n524\n00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,750\nyou'll see you have Power Nap for\nBattery too, all right.\n\n525\n00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,586\nYou can turn that on and say, yeah,\nI want you to go to sleep while you're on\n\n526\n00:25:29,586 --> 00:25:31,585\nbattery, that way you don't\neat up all your power.\n\n527\n00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:34,785\nBut go ahead and wake up once in\nan hour to do a Time machine backup.\n\n528\n00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,485\nI do want you to do that all right.\n\n529\n00:25:36,485 --> 00:25:38,515\nSo you can specify that if you need it.\n\n530\n00:25:38,515 --> 00:25:41,985\nThe reality is if that the machine's\nbeen asleep for a long period of time.\n\n531\n00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:42,635\nNothing has changed.\n\n532\n00:25:42,635 --> 00:25:45,935\nAnd if nothing has changed you\nprobably don't need to do a backup and\n\n533\n00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:47,835\nthat's why that's turned off by default.\n\n534\n00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:48,365\nBut it's up to you.\n\n535\n00:25:48,365 --> 00:25:49,811\nYou can turn that on if you want.\n\n536\n00:25:53,712 --> 00:25:54,640\nAll right.\n\n537\n00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,640\nSo those are some of the options with\nTime Machine to make sure that it\n\n538\n00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,120\nkeeps running in the background and\ndoing its job.\n\n539\n00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,150\nMine is set up.\n\n540\n00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:05,470\nIt's running, I'm backing up my system,\nand it's good to go.\n\n541\n00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,860\nNow I can just forget about it, all right.\n\n542\n00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,320\nFor the next 23 hours,\nit's gonna do a back up once an hour.\n\n543\n00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:20,170\nWhen it gets to 24 hours, it's gonna\nsave the older one, the first back up.\n\n544\n00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:25,595\nWhen it It gets to 25 hours,\nit's gonna delete my second backup.\n\n545\n00:26:25,595 --> 00:26:27,975\nWhen it gets to 26 hours,\nit'll delete my third backup.\n\n546\n00:26:27,975 --> 00:26:33,815\nAnd the reason is, it's gonna save\none backup a day for 31 days.\n\n547\n00:26:33,815 --> 00:26:38,345\nIt'll save one backup an hour for\nthe last 24 hours,\n\n548\n00:26:38,345 --> 00:26:42,282\nthen one backup a day for\nthe last 30 days, and\n\n549\n00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:46,910\nthen one backup a month,\nsorry, one backup a week, for\n\n550\n00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,960\nas far back as it can,\nuntil the hard drive runs out of space.\n\n551\n00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,344\nSo it may have tons of backups in there,\nbut\n\n552\n00:26:55,344 --> 00:27:01,176\nin a given year there's kind of a maximum\nto how many you can have, right.\n\n553\n00:27:01,176 --> 00:27:03,081\nThere's 52 weeks in a year, but if we have\n24 backups for the last 24 hours, and\n\n554\n00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:04,153\nthen a daily backup for\nthe last month, right.\n\n555\n00:27:04,153 --> 00:27:06,951\nSo that would be 31 plus 24 backups,\nright so\n\n556\n00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:11,182\nyou're at like 55 backups, and\nthen one a week for the rest of the year,\n\n557\n00:27:11,182 --> 00:27:15,930\nwell that would be roughly let's say\n48 weeks, so another 48 backups.\n\n558\n00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:24,086\nSo, you end up with just a hair\nover 100 backups on your drive.\n\n559\n00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:28,463\nThe very first one, is a full one,\nyour entire computer.\n\n560\n00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:31,461\nAnd then after that,\nit's just what changes.\n\n561\n00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:34,465\nTo be able to go back an entire year,\nit's really not all that much,\n\n562\n00:27:34,465 --> 00:27:36,859\nit fits on the drive, and\nyou've got access to that.\n\n563\n00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:37,662\nReally cool stuff.\n\n564\n00:27:37,662 --> 00:27:41,552\nAll right, well, let's take a look at how\nit's actually backing this up cuz it's\n\n565\n00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:42,952\nreally not all that complex.\n\n566\n00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:46,166\nWhen it backs up to the drive,\nit created a folder on the drive that\n\n567\n00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,630\nwas called a backup database,\na backup DB right.\n\n568\n00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,050\nLet's take a look at that again.\n\n569\n00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:55,640\nIf I browse into my backup hard drive,\nI see this backups.backupdb folder.\n\n570\n00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,190\nAnd if I browse into that,\nI see Don's MacBook Pro.\n\n571\n00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,150\nNow, why does it have that?\n\n572\n00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,900\nYou can actually use the same hard\ndrive on more than one computer.\n\n573\n00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,820\nIf it's a removable drive, I can hook\nit up to somebody else's computer and\n\n574\n00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,080\nback theirs up to.\n\n575\n00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,670\nSo you might have more than one person's\ncomputer, and they'll all show up here.\n\n576\n00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,883\nThat's how those time capsules work.\n\n577\n00:28:16,577 --> 00:28:19,910\nThen if I browse into that,\nI start to see dates, all right.\n\n578\n00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,410\nThese are the dates where\nthe backups happened.\n\n579\n00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,800\nI have a backup on February 19th,\nwell I've got three of them now, right.\n\n580\n00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,690\nAnd each of them has the little\ntime stamp embedded in it.\n\n581\n00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,249\nThe very first one that ran,\nthat's the full backup.\n\n582\n00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:33,830\nThe other ones are just changes.\n\n583\n00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,530\nIf I look at the sizes of these folders,\nlike this first one here.\n\n584\n00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:41,870\nIf I pull up its size, it's calculating\nthe size right now, this first one.\n\n585\n00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,570\nActually wait, is that the first one?\n\n586\n00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,500\nShoot, no, that's not the first one.\n\n587\n00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,400\nLet me park that over here.\n\n588\n00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,240\nActually, you know what?\n\n589\n00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,610\nHere, I'll just pull them all up.\n\n590\n00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,180\nWe'll go crazy.\n\n591\n00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,920\nWill tax my hard drive here as it\ncalculates the size of all these things.\n\n592\n00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,740\nSo here's these three back ups.\n\n593\n00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,100\nAnd I just wanna pull them up here so\n\n594\n00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:05,200\nwe can see apples to apples,\nwhat their sizes are.\n\n595\n00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,020\nSo it's calculating the size.\n\n596\n00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,160\nThis one over here on the right.\n\n597\n00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,180\nThis one, the date on it, right?\n\n598\n00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,817\nFebruary 19th, 2015 and\nthe time on it, well,\n\n599\n00:29:15,817 --> 00:29:19,624\nthat's a time stamp that it's\nusing to track it, so it.\n\n600\n00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:24,609\nI'm not exactly sure what they based\nthat time on but if you look at it,\n\n601\n00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:29,090\nI've got one of these,\nit's 151156, 151819,\n\n602\n00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:34,310\n152047, the lower the number,\nthe earlier that backup was.\n\n603\n00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,680\nAnd so, this one on the left,\nthat's my first backup.\n\n604\n00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,215\nMy second backup,\nsee how it shows a size here of,\n\n605\n00:29:41,215 --> 00:29:44,860\nif these are bytes, kilobytes,\nmegabytes, gigabytes.\n\n606\n00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,280\nIt shows a size of 10 GB, all right.\n\n607\n00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,030\nThis backup shows a size of 10 GB,\n\n608\n00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:57,390\nand it even says right here 11.78 GB\nafter you correct for sector sizing.\n\n609\n00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:01,570\nThis one is 11.66 GB, this one's 11.66 GB.\n\n610\n00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,960\nThat sounds like over 30 gigs of storage,\nbut,\n\n611\n00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,660\nnotice the next number,\nwhich is the size on disk.\n\n612\n00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,900\nThese are actually pretty small when\nyou consider what's on the disk,\n\n613\n00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,060\ncuz it's really just the changes.\n\n614\n00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,410\nInside of these, if I browse into them,\nany file that was changed,\n\n615\n00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,560\nthe actual file is copied in there, right.\n\n616\n00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:27,870\nBut anything that wasn't changed, it\nputs what's called a hard link in there.\n\n617\n00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,520\nA hard link looks like the file, but\n\n618\n00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,710\nit's actually just pointing to\nwhere the file still exists today.\n\n619\n00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,200\nThat file is in the original back up.\n\n620\n00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,900\nThis back up that I did over here on\nthe left, the one that's 10.75 gigs.\n\n621\n00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,530\nThat file might not be in these new ones.\n\n622\n00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,150\nIt might have gotten deleted, or\nit might have been changed, and\n\n623\n00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,990\nif it was changed,\nthe new copy is in here, right.\n\n624\n00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,680\nBut if it hasn't been changed,\n\n625\n00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,070\nthis will just contain a pointer that\npoints back to the original one.\n\n626\n00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:59,460\nSo it looks like I've got\nover 30 gigs in backups but\n\n627\n00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:05,070\nthe drive itself, if I pull up the hard\ndrive itself, see how it says,\n\n628\n00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,500\nI've got 549 gigs of storage, 540 gigs\navailable, I'm only using 9.3 gigs.\n\n629\n00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:16,140\nHow am I only using 9.3 gigs,\nwhen I can clearly see\n\n630\n00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,650\nI've got about 32 gigs of storage\neaten up between these three folders.\n\n631\n00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,440\nIt's because of those hard links.\n\n632\n00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,110\nAnd that's really cool for us, because\nif you browse into one of these folders,\n\n633\n00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,880\nlike if I browse into my newest backup,\nit's only backed up with change.\n\n634\n00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,000\nWell what changed?\n\n635\n00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,970\nI downloaded Royal TSX and\nI copied that like eight times, right?\n\n636\n00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,260\nSo if I browse into that,\nhere's my hard drive.\n\n637\n00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,500\nAnd if I browse into that, here's\napplications, library, system, users.\n\n638\n00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,960\nI'll go into users.\n\n639\n00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,820\nAnd there's Don Pezet, and if I go into\ndownloads, there's the file I downloaded.\n\n640\n00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,802\nWell, actually, just one copy of it.\n\n641\n00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:53,585\nDid I not copy that before the backup?\n\n642\n00:31:53,585 --> 00:31:55,565\nI may not have.\nAnyhow, I see the file right there.\n\n643\n00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:56,095\nThere it is.\n\n644\n00:31:56,095 --> 00:31:58,635\nI can get at that file.\nThat's the one that I backed up, right.\n\n645\n00:31:58,635 --> 00:32:01,213\nBut what about all these other folders?\n\n646\n00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:04,183\nWell, if I take a look at\nsome of these other folders,\n\n647\n00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:06,955\nlike if I browse into System and\nLibrary, right,\n\n648\n00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:11,190\nI see these folders and\nas I browse into them there's files.\n\n649\n00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,140\nThose files take up space, don't they?\n\n650\n00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,710\nWell, not really.\n\n651\n00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,280\nThese aren't really files.\n\n652\n00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,760\nThese are pointers.\n\n653\n00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,000\nThese are hard links,\nthat point to a file that still exists,\n\n654\n00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,450\nthat wasn't changed it was already there.\n\n655\n00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,100\nAnd it's still the same\nway as it was before.\n\n656\n00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,050\nSo instead it creates these\nlinks that point to it.\n\n657\n00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:32,000\nAnd you really can't tell that,\nlooking at the GUI.\n\n658\n00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,730\nWhere you see that is in the terminal.\n\n659\n00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:42,123\nIf you drop to your terminal,\nand you switch into that volume.\n\n660\n00:32:42,123 --> 00:32:46,240\nLet's get into there.\n\n661\n00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,590\nWhat you'll see is that buried in here\nare going to be a lot of pointers.\n\n662\n00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:56,450\nIf I browse into that older backup\nthat I've got, let's see, 152047.\n\n663\n00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,330\nAnd my hard drive, whoops.\n\n664\n00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,660\nBrowse that hard drive.\n\n665\n00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,610\nAnd let's see, where do we wanna go?\n\n666\n00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:11,369\nLet's go into system,\nlibrary, preferences,\n\n667\n00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:23,260\nWell, we'll go into preference panes,\nthat'll work.\n\n668\n00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,670\nThere we go.\n\n669\n00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,960\nSo here's all these preference panes,\nall right.\n\n670\n00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,910\nThese preference panes,\nthey all take up space.\n\n671\n00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:36,970\nIf I do an LS-L, I can see where they\nall have a size associated with them.\n\n672\n00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,660\nThese all look like files to me but\nthey're actually links.\n\n673\n00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,910\nThey're hard links that are pointing\nover to the other side.\n\n674\n00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,300\nAnd they've all got little\nat symbols beside them,\n\n675\n00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,470\nwhich just lets me know they have\nextended attributes that are tied to it.\n\n676\n00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,470\nAnd most of them will even show what\nthey're linked to, to somewhere else.\n\n677\n00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,650\nThese guys are linked to\nthe originals that haven't changed.\n\n678\n00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,590\nThey are actually stored in that\nfirst backup if I were to change\n\n679\n00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,000\nall the way back into that\none we would see it there.\n\n680\n00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,990\nBut it looks like they're all there.\n\n681\n00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:06,870\nSo if I wanna go and get the files\nout of the latest backup I can\n\n682\n00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,550\nactually just navigate\nright into that folder.\n\n683\n00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,450\nYou don't have to use\nthe Time Machine wizard or anything.\n\n684\n00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,430\nYou can just browse right into it and\nget to it.\n\n685\n00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,390\nAnd recover your data that way.\n\n686\n00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:18,060\nBut there is an easier way using\nthe actual Time Machine utilities.\n\n687\n00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,690\nSo I wanna show you guys\nthat after the break.\n\n688\n00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,260\nBut for right now,\n\n689\n00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,020\nI just wanted to show you that structure\nof how this data is stored on the drive.\n\n690\n00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,170\nThere's really not much to it,\nit just separates them out by date, and\n\n691\n00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:31,620\ndoes a bunch of hard links for\nunchanged software, or unchanged files.\n\n692\n00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,912\nAnd then it does the actually copies\nof the files that have changed,\n\n693\n00:34:34,912 --> 00:34:36,250\nthose aren't hard links.\n\n694\n00:34:40,046 --> 00:34:43,320\nAll right, so we've got some backups,\nwe're in pretty good shape there.\n\n695\n00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,500\nThe next thing I wanna take a look at\nis recovering and restoring our data,\n\n696\n00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,400\nall right?\n\n697\n00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,510\nBut this is a pretty good spot to stop and\ntake a break.\n\n698\n00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:53,350\nSo let's pause here, when we get back\nwe'll see recovering some data and\n\n699\n00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:56,220\nI want to show you another\nneat thing that it does\n\n700\n00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,130\neven if our backup disk is unavailable.\n\n701\n00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,807\nSo there's some cool stuff there too.\n\n702\n00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,084\nStay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n703\n00:35:01,084 --> 00:35:07,360\n[MUSIC]\n\n704\n00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,995\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n705\n00:35:09,995 --> 00:35:13,747\nSo in the first couple of segments there\nwe got a chance to see how to turn\n\n706\n00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:16,330\nTime Machine on and how to do our backups.\n\n707\n00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,140\nNow let's look at the important stuff.\n\n708\n00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,610\nThe important stuff is,\nhow do I restore my data?\n\n709\n00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:25,150\nHow do I get my data back again if I have\na failure, or if I make a bad change, or\n\n710\n00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,210\nwhatever, right?\n\n711\n00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,640\nWell, fortunately, a very easy process.\n\n712\n00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,820\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n713\n00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,060\nSo, I'm gonna switch back\nto my regular desktop here.\n\n714\n00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,830\nFor whatever reason, my virtual machine\ndoesn't seem to like Time Machine.\n\n715\n00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,265\nBut here I am on just my regular laptop.\n\n716\n00:35:38,265 --> 00:35:39,950\nI use Time Machine myself.\n\n717\n00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,620\nI mentioned I've got this\nexternal drive I back up to.\n\n718\n00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,590\nThat's this back up hard drive here.\n\n719\n00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:49,660\nAnd if I browse into that,\nI can see my dp laptop, that's my machine.\n\n720\n00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:53,100\nAnd you can see back ups from my\nlaptop going all the back to September\n\n721\n00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,690\nof last year.\n\n722\n00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,530\nAnd backups as recently as today,\njust a little while ago.\n\n723\n00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:02,440\nSo this is where I store the backups of\nmy drive, they're just all right here.\n\n724\n00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,420\nIf I lose a file, or make a change, or\n\n725\n00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,310\nsomething like that,\nI go to this drive to recover.\n\n726\n00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:13,530\nI've got a folder on my desktop called\nrouter configs, and I've got some\n\n727\n00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,920\nrouter configuration files in here from\nanother show that I've been doing.\n\n728\n00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,830\nAnd let's say that I delete some of these,\n\n729\n00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,180\nmaybe like branch one\nthrough branch three.\n\n730\n00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,990\nI'm just gonna delete those files.\n\n731\n00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,200\nI'll move them to the trash,\nand I'll go ahead and\n\n732\n00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,310\nempty my trash just to get rid of those.\n\n733\n00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:34,620\nAnd then maybe I take a file like\nHQ.txt and I modify it, right.\n\n734\n00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,460\nSo I'm not I'm not deleting the file.\n\n735\n00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,380\nIt's not becoming corrupt.\n\n736\n00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,690\nI'm just changing it.\n\n737\n00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,980\nMaybe I go in here and\nI delete a bunch of lines out.\n\n738\n00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:48,850\nAnd I just write something\nlike Don was here, right.\n\n739\n00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:54,480\nSo, now I've like maliciously deleted data\nand it's missing from the file, okay.\n\n740\n00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,250\nI still have the file, I didn't delete it.\n\n741\n00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,060\nIt's not corrupted,\nit's just missing information, right.\n\n742\n00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,560\nIt's a different version of that\nfile than what I want, all right.\n\n743\n00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,680\nWell, if I wanna get the old version\nof that file back or if I wanna recover\n\n744\n00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,300\nthe files that I deleted, I can just\njump into Time Machine, all right.\n\n745\n00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,940\nThe easiest way to use Time Machine\nis to browse to whatever\n\n746\n00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,780\nfolder it is that has the data or\nshould have the data that you want.\n\n747\n00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,750\nAnd then you can use your\nTime Machine menu item up here\n\n748\n00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,470\nto choose enter Time Machine.\n\n749\n00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,160\nThat will take you into\na Time Machine view.\n\n750\n00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,460\nAnd the Time Machine view,\nit's really pretty slick.\n\n751\n00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,300\nLet's go full screen on this one cuz my\nhead's gonna cover up the coolest part.\n\n752\n00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,530\nWhat you see on the right side\nis a list of all my backups.\n\n753\n00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,620\nRemember when I browsed that hard drive\nI said I had backups all the way back to\n\n754\n00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,150\nSeptember of last year, so\nthat's what I see up here at the top.\n\n755\n00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:47,870\nAnd then I see October, November, December\ncoming forward all the way to now.\n\n756\n00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:51,800\nNow, that's how my hard drive looks right\nnow, and that's what I'm looking at.\n\n757\n00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,650\nBut I can use these up and down arrows,\nor I can go through here and\n\n758\n00:37:54,650 --> 00:38:00,070\nclick on various days to see what this\nfolder looked like on a particular day.\n\n759\n00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,980\nSo what did my router configs\nfolder look like yesterday?\n\n760\n00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,570\nAnd I can go back and I can see it, and\nnotice there's my branch one, two, and\n\n761\n00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,560\nthree files back again, right.\n\n762\n00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,920\nOr I can go back even further.\n\n763\n00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,190\nI can go back to January, and when I jump\nback there, see how it's not jumping?\n\n764\n00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:22,590\nThe reason it's not jumping is I\ndidn't have that folder back then.\n\n765\n00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,830\nBack in January,\nthat show that I made that folder for\n\n766\n00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:28,290\nis the one I was just recording\ntwo weeks ago, so it didn't exist.\n\n767\n00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:32,060\nSo, I can't go back to a point where it\ndidn't exist, but if I stick to these\n\n768\n00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,670\ntimes when it did exist, I can jump in and\nI can recover that missing data.\n\n769\n00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,520\nNow, how do I recover the missing data?\n\n770\n00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,360\nWell, in the case of branch\none through branch three,\n\n771\n00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,710\nI can just highlight them and\nhit this restore button.\n\n772\n00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:49,500\nI can restore that, and\nit's gonna put it back into now, and so\n\n773\n00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,620\nthere they go, they just reappear.\n\n774\n00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,820\nI got branch one, branch two,\nand branch three, all right.\n\n775\n00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,730\nAnd I can do the same thing for the file\nthat was missing part of it's data,\n\n776\n00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,940\nis I can go and grab one of those\nolder ones and restore it too.\n\n777\n00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,040\nSo I can just jump right\nback into my Time Machine,\n\n778\n00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,790\nsounds a lot cooler when\nyou say it that way.\n\n779\n00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,610\nBut I can just go right back a few days or\nwhatever.\n\n780\n00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:15,470\nI can find that HQ.txt, and\nnotice I can restore it.\n\n781\n00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,620\nBut what if I've made other\nchanges to the file since then,\n\n782\n00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,880\nand all I want is that one\nlittle part that was deleted.\n\n783\n00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,290\nWell, instead of restoring it,\nI can choose open.\n\n784\n00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:30,590\nI can open that file, and now I can\njust copy the pieces that were missing.\n\n785\n00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:34,900\nI can just get those little bits that\nwere missing, and bring those back over\n\n786\n00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,700\ninstead of overriding the entire file\nif I've made additional changes.\n\n787\n00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,290\nI can also use this little share\nbutton here to do other things,\n\n788\n00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,870\nlike send it by email, or copy it.\n\n789\n00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:48,581\nSo you can do a few different things\nto get that data out of here,\n\n790\n00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:50,970\nand send it somewhere else on the drive.\n\n791\n00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:54,879\nBut in my case, I haven't made any other\nchanges, so I can just right-click and\n\n792\n00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:55,751\nchoose Restore.\n\n793\n00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:56,668\nIt's gonna restore it back.\n\n794\n00:39:56,668 --> 00:39:58,642\nAnd put it in there.\n\n795\n00:39:58,642 --> 00:40:00,292\nWell when I go to put it in there,\n\n796\n00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:03,760\nit's smart enough to know\nthat the file already exists.\n\n797\n00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,750\nSo it gives me the chance again to go\nahead and pick somewhere else to save it.\n\n798\n00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:13,330\nI can choose to just put it right onto my\ndesktop, or somewhere like that if I want.\n\n799\n00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:17,800\nSo that it's not overwriting those files\nthat I've already got in existence.\n\n800\n00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,600\nSo I can just drop it right here\non my desktop and I'll do that and\n\n801\n00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,050\nhere's that HQ.txt that it just recovered.\n\n802\n00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,420\nNow what I can do is I can open that and\n\n803\n00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:33,160\nmaybe I take that and park it over\nhere on one side of my screen.\n\n804\n00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,810\nAnd then I go and\nI find the one that I have now and\n\n805\n00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,410\nI park that on the other\nside of my screen.\n\n806\n00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:44,350\nAnd so now the left side, that's how\nthe file looked a few weeks ago or\n\n807\n00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,470\na few days ago.\n\n808\n00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,710\nOn the right side is what I have now.\n\n809\n00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,830\nI can just come in and\ncopy just the pieces that I need.\n\n810\n00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:53,230\nI need all of this stuff is what I lost.\n\n811\n00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,080\nAnd so I can just copy that,\ncome over here and paste it.\n\n812\n00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:02,080\nAnd then this way,\nI don't lose the changes that I've made\n\n813\n00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,740\nsince the file was last backed up.\n\n814\n00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,570\nSo, I can do that, now I've got it and\nmy file's recovered.\n\n815\n00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:11,410\nSo you can recover piecemeal or\nrecover the entire file all at once,\n\n816\n00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:14,010\nit's up to you how you\nwant to go about that.\n\n817\n00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,350\nThat's what Time Machine facilitates.\n\n818\n00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,720\nNow what if this was a really bad failure?\n\n819\n00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,240\nWhat if the hard drive in my\nlaptop was completely dead and\n\n820\n00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,260\nmaybe my laptop wasn't under warranty?\n\n821\n00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,410\nSo I go down to the store and\nI buy a brand new hard drive and\n\n822\n00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,330\nI pop it in this computer.\n\n823\n00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,960\nWell, what's on that hard drive?\n\n824\n00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,650\nNothing, it's blank.\n\n825\n00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,070\nSo, can I boot up my computer?\n\n826\n00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,210\nI can't even boot my computer because\nI don't have Mac OS on that drive,\n\n827\n00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,320\nI need to reinstall it.\n\n828\n00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,250\nWell, if you've got a USB\ninstallation media,\n\n829\n00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,310\nyou can pop that onto your computer and\nyou can do your install.\n\n830\n00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:47,560\nIf it's a newer Mac, you can use\nthe Internet based recovery, and\n\n831\n00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,370\nit'll actually download OS X from Apple's\nservers and download and install it.\n\n832\n00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,030\nYou can go that route too.\n\n833\n00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,520\nBut, there's actually a little secret,\n\n834\n00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,380\na little secret about\nyour Time Machine drive.\n\n835\n00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,570\nWhen you make a Time Machine drive,\n\n836\n00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:05,020\nit actually puts a recovery\npartition on the Time Machine drive.\n\n837\n00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,920\nSo if you have a blank hard drive in your\nlaptop or your desktop, you can actually\n\n838\n00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,580\nboot off of your time machine drive,\nand it will boot you into recovery.\n\n839\n00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,400\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n840\n00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,890\nSo even with an absolutely\nblank hard drive in your Mac,\n\n841\n00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,160\nyou boot off of the time machine drive.\n\n842\n00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,270\nIt'll take you into recovery and\n\n843\n00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:24,700\none of the options right on that main\nscreen is restore from Time Machine.\n\n844\n00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,600\nAnd you pick that and\n\n845\n00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,330\nit'll restore your entire computer from\nTime Machine right back on to the system.\n\n846\n00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:33,190\nAnd you've got a full back-up,\nand now you are back in business.\n\n847\n00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,300\nReally cool, really easy.\n\n848\n00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,860\nThat's what Apple is set out to do,\n\n849\n00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,520\nmake the backups easy, because if\nyou don't, people won't do them.\n\n850\n00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,390\nPeople won't do the backups\nif they're hard to do.\n\n851\n00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,332\nThat's their main thing that\nthey kind of push for on that.\n\n852\n00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:47,700\nAll right,\n\n853\n00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:53,280\na few other comments that I want to make\nabout Time Machine before we wrap up.\n\n854\n00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,640\nThe way Time Machine looks at\nfiles to see if they've changed,\n\n855\n00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,700\nit's really just looking at\ntheir file size and their date.\n\n856\n00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,920\nIf their file size and date have changed,\nthat means the file itself has changed and\n\n857\n00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,330\nit's gonna do a back up.\n\n858\n00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:08,090\nIf the file size has gotten smaller or\nbigger or if the date is newer,\n\n859\n00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,560\nthen it knows that it changed and\nneeds to back it up.\n\n860\n00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,660\nWhen it backs up the file,\nit backs up the entire file.\n\n861\n00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:19,560\nSo if I have a massive file,\nlike a database, or my virtual machines,\n\n862\n00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,230\nI have virtual machines on here,\nlet's see if we can find those.\n\n863\n00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:27,610\nSo my virtual machines,\nif I browse onto my hard drive here and\n\n864\n00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,040\nI go under documents.\n\n865\n00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,470\nOkay, this virtual machines folder.\n\n866\n00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,120\nHere's some virtual machines that I use.\n\n867\n00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,620\nMy screen mirror machine, CentOS,\nright, these different things.\n\n868\n00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:41,340\nThese virtual machine files, some of them,\nlike my screen mirror, is 30 gigs in size.\n\n869\n00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,930\nIf I boot that machine up,\nand then shut it down again.\n\n870\n00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:47,110\nThere's gonna be some changes in there.\n\n871\n00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:50,110\nAnd it will back up\nthe entire file all 30 gigs.\n\n872\n00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:53,310\nEven though only a very\nsmall portion of it changed.\n\n873\n00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:56,990\nSo Time Machine is not terribly\nefficient with large files like this,\n\n874\n00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:59,430\nlarge files that change frequently.\n\n875\n00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:04,950\nSo if I'm worried about because in theory\nthat could fill up my external hard drive.\n\n876\n00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:08,690\nMy external hard drive is backing up\nin each of those VMs that I back up\n\n877\n00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,030\nis taking up space every\ntime I boot them up.\n\n878\n00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:13,430\nIf I'm worried about taking up space,\n\n879\n00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,620\nI might want to exclude this\ndirectory from my back up.\n\n880\n00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,240\nNot back these files up and\nback up them up manually.\n\n881\n00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,850\nSo I'll manually back them\nup every now an then so\n\n882\n00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,660\nit doesn't fill up my entire drive.\n\n883\n00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,970\nThat's important, because it will make\nyour backups fill the drive up faster.\n\n884\n00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:31,680\nIf you wanna be able to go as\nfar back in time as possible,\n\n885\n00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,500\nyou don't want your drive to be full.\n\n886\n00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,780\nIf you look at my drive,\nlike if I pull up it's information,\n\n887\n00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,755\nit's a one terabyte drive, and\nit's still got 285 gigs of space on it.\n\n888\n00:44:40,755 --> 00:44:43,375\nSo it's got about a third\nof the drive available.\n\n889\n00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:46,975\nI'm not full, I've got back ups all\nthe way to September of last year.\n\n890\n00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,895\nThat's five months worth of back ups.\n\n891\n00:44:50,247 --> 00:44:51,437\nActually is it five?\n\n892\n00:44:51,437 --> 00:44:52,757\nYes, that was good math.\n\n893\n00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:55,937\nFive months worth of backups here,\nand the drive's not full yet.\n\n894\n00:44:55,937 --> 00:44:58,299\nI'll be able to keep going,\nkeep getting backups, and\n\n895\n00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:00,957\nhave at least a few more months on there\nbefore that drive is actually full.\n\n896\n00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:04,297\nActually, I even have\nmore space than that,\n\n897\n00:45:04,297 --> 00:45:06,627\ncause I think I have\na Windows backup on there.\n\n898\n00:45:06,627 --> 00:45:10,530\nIf I browse into my Time Machine,\nI have a Windows drive image that I made.\n\n899\n00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,990\nThat's 128 gigs of storage there.\n\n900\n00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:17,310\nAnd that's eating up even more space on\nthat system that could be available for\n\n901\n00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,400\nTime Machine backups.\n\n902\n00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,240\nSo I could take that out.\n\n903\n00:45:20,295 --> 00:45:22,800\nBut that's another thing to\nkeep in mind that's on there.\n\n904\n00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,360\nNow the last thing that I wanna\nmention on Time Machine is\n\n905\n00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,710\nwhat happens if I don't have\nmy Time Machine disk with me.\n\n906\n00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:33,980\nIf it's an external disk and\nI don't have it with me.\n\n907\n00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:38,120\nOr what happens to all the stuff that I\nchanged in the hour between Time Machine\n\n908\n00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,120\nback ups?\n\n909\n00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:46,840\nWell, Time Machine can actually maintain\na local copy of a Time Machine back up.\n\n910\n00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,720\nA Time Machine back up is right\nhere on your own hard drive.\n\n911\n00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,915\nNow that will not help you if\nyou have a hard drive failure.\n\n912\n00:45:52,915 --> 00:45:55,650\nCuz it's stored on the same\nhard drive as your actual data.\n\n913\n00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:56,450\nRight?\n\n914\n00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:00,340\nBut it will help you in the case of\nan accidental deletion or a file change.\n\n915\n00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,670\nIt can have a local\ncache that it maintains\n\n916\n00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,780\nuntil the next time that you can back up.\n\n917\n00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,120\nSo if you ever have your computer sitting,\nand it goes a day or two, and\n\n918\n00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,140\nyou haven't plugged into your\nTime Machine hard drive.\n\n919\n00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,940\nAnd then you accidentally delete a file,\ndon't panic.\n\n920\n00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,230\nIt's not a big deal that it didn't get\nbacked up to your Time Machine disk.\n\n921\n00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:19,500\nAs long as your disk is still good,\n\n922\n00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,060\nyou can pull it from the local\nTime Machine back up.\n\n923\n00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,560\nWhen you enter Time Machine mode.\n\n924\n00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:28,340\nYou actually see all of the backups\nthat are on your Time Machine disk,\n\n925\n00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,980\nas well as the local backup\nthat it;s maintaining.\n\n926\n00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:34,730\nIt only has one local backup that it\nmaintains, but you'll be able to see that.\n\n927\n00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:35,960\nAnd it's just mixed in together so\n\n928\n00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,630\nyou don't even notice that\nit's a different back up.\n\n929\n00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,420\nIf you ever want to see it,\nit's hidden by default.\n\n930\n00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,610\nYou can't see it here inside of Mac OS.\n\n931\n00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:48,430\nAnd I usually disable it on my system cuz\nI, I eat up hard drive space like crazy.\n\n932\n00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,300\nThe local backup that it makes,\nis made right here on your desk so\n\n933\n00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,630\nit does eat up some space.\n\n934\n00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:55,420\nSo you might wanna disable it too,\nI usually do.\n\n935\n00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,850\nBut, it is a nice feature to have.\n\n936\n00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,530\nIf you want to see it in terminal,\n\n937\n00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:05,910\nif you jump to your volumes folder,\nyeah I don't have one.\n\n938\n00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:10,930\nIf you go into your volumes folder and\ndo an ls -la, that la\n\n939\n00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:16,730\nmeans the long form, and a means\nshow all folders, even hidden ones.\n\n940\n00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:21,810\nYou might see a volume in here that's\nnamed to be that local backup.\n\n941\n00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,140\nI'm trying to remember the name of it.\n\n942\n00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,610\nOh, Mobile Backups.\n\n943\n00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:28,700\nSo you might see a folder in here\nthat's called Mobile Backups.\n\n944\n00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:33,740\nIf you see that folder, that's\nthe local cache copy of Time Machine.\n\n945\n00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,980\nSo it's doing a backup of it right\nhere to your own hard drive.\n\n946\n00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,840\nAgain, does not help at all\nwith a hard drive failure.\n\n947\n00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,892\nIt just helps with accidental deletions or\nchanges when you haven't plugged in your\n\n948\n00:47:44,892 --> 00:47:47,360\nactual Time Machine back\nup disk in a little while.\n\n949\n00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,974\nSo, useful thing to have,\n\n950\n00:47:48,974 --> 00:47:53,269\nnot something you'd wanna bank on\nas you're only back up destination.\n\n951\n00:47:53,269 --> 00:47:59,420\nAll right, now let's say that I wanted\nto make sure that feature was turned on.\n\n952\n00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,940\nI don't have that folder here.\n\n953\n00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,220\nSo do I know if a feature is turned on or\nnot?\n\n954\n00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,910\nWell, I turned it off so\nI know it's not turned on.\n\n955\n00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,310\nIt's on be default.\n\n956\n00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,720\nSo most of you guys, if you've never\nlooked at this, you should have that.\n\n957\n00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,480\nYou should have mobile backups folder.\n\n958\n00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,383\nIf I want to turn it on the command\nis pretty simple, it's,\n\n959\n00:48:14,383 --> 00:48:17,415\nyou do have to be an administrator so\nI've got to do a.\n\n960\n00:48:17,415 --> 00:48:21,240\nAnd then the command itself is T-M util,\n\n961\n00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:26,730\nthat's the time machine utility,\nand then enable local.\n\n962\n00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:30,385\nThat's gonna tell it that\nit's okay to go ahead and\n\n963\n00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:34,720\nmaintain a local time machine\nbackup right here on my drive.\n\n964\n00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,498\nRight, now if I disconnect my time\nmachine backup and I wait long enough,\n\n965\n00:48:39,498 --> 00:48:42,811\nit will do another backup\nright here on my own disk,\n\n966\n00:48:42,811 --> 00:48:45,680\nas opposed to just not\ndoing a backup at all.\n\n967\n00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,480\nAnd if I wanna turn it off, so\nit's not eating up space on my disk,\n\n968\n00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,150\nI can come in and I can say, sudu tm util\n\n969\n00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:00,240\ndisable local.\n\n970\n00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,010\nAnd that's gonna turn it off, and\nwipe out that local backup, all right?\n\n971\n00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:10,350\nSo, if you're on something like an SSD,\nlike I am, and your space is at a premium,\n\n972\n00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,850\nI, you can't get the giant hard\ndrive cuz they're too expensive.\n\n973\n00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,080\nSo, your space is at a premium and you\nneed all the hard drive space you can get,\n\n974\n00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,100\nyou might want to remove\nthat time machine back up,\n\n975\n00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,750\njust because you need the space for\nother things.\n\n976\n00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,500\nBut it is nice to have that little go\nto backup you can get to, and in fact,\n\n977\n00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,570\nI'll just go ahead and\nturn mine back on, lately,\n\n978\n00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:31,650\ncuz there was one show where I need\na lot of VMs and I ran out of space.\n\n979\n00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:34,130\nI don't have those anymore, so\nI'll go ahead and turn it back on, and\n\n980\n00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,120\nthen later on, it'll recreate that file.\n\n981\n00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,220\nSo if you're ever poking around\nin the volumes folder and\n\n982\n00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,510\nyou see that mobile backups folder\nin there, that's what it is.\n\n983\n00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,310\nIt's a local cache of time machine.\n\n984\n00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,740\nAll right.\nWell, I think that is about it.\n\n985\n00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:52,030\nI'm trying to think if there's anything\nelse I need to mention on time machine.\n\n986\n00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,270\nIt's pretty straight forward.\n\n987\n00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:56,200\nThe whole focus of the thing\nis to make it easy to use.\n\n988\n00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,640\nAnd I think they achieve that.\n\n989\n00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,190\nOf the backup software I've worked with,\ntime machine's is probably the easiest,\n\n990\n00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,450\nand it's very good at what it does.\n\n991\n00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:03,970\nIt's very effective.\n\n992\n00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:09,090\nAll right, well that's a pretty good\nspot for us to wrap us this episode.\n\n993\n00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:12,690\nLet me remind you guys if you\nhave questions on any of this,\n\n994\n00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:13,800\njust let us know.\n\n995\n00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,680\nLive during the show you\ncan go to ITpro.tv/live,\n\n996\n00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,560\nand you'll see the chat room\nright beneath the video.\n\n997\n00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,000\nPost your questions there,\nwe monitor and answer during the show.\n\n998\n00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,600\nIf you have any questions after the show,\nuse our Q and A forums.\n\n999\n00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,540\nAt the top of every page on IT Pro TV,\nyou'll see a link that says Q and A.\n\n1000\n00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,151\nClick on it.\n\n1001\n00:50:30,151 --> 00:50:33,080\nIt will take you to the forums,\nyou can post your questions there.\n\n1002\n00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,990\nWe monitor and answer after the show.\n\n1003\n00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,820\nI feel like i'm forgetting something.\n\n1004\n00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,540\nSometimes when you have stuff like\na time machine, it's so simple,\n\n1005\n00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,990\nyou just feel like you forget\nsomething but, yeah all right well.\n\n1006\n00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,799\nSo, I'm gonna wrap it up here, if I can\nthink of what I forgot I'll record another\n\n1007\n00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:51,385\nsegment and stick it on to the end of\nthis show, but that should be about it.\n\n1008\n00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:52,753\nSo I hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n1009\n00:50:52,753 --> 00:50:56,873\nSigning off for ITPro tv, I'm Don Pezet,\nand I'll see you next time.\n\n1010\n00:50:56,873 --> 00:51:06,873\n[MUSIC]\n\n1011\n00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:11,990\n[SOUND]\n\n",

right.\n\n5\n00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:34,930\nGood morning.\n\n6\n00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,280\nGood afternoon and good evening and\n\n7\n00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,570\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,590\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n9\n00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,160\nback again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n10\n00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,080\nToday, we're going to be\njumping into part five,\n\n11\n00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,650\na whole new section,\nwhich is focused on applications.\n\n12\n00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,220\nAnd boy, there's a lot to talk about\nwhen it comes to applications.\n\n13\n00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,780\nWe're gonna start off just by talking\nabout how we get applications loaded\n\n14\n00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,080\nonto the system in the first place.\n\n15\n00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,750\nAnd then we're gonna move into some of\nthe different types of applications that\n\n16\n00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,570\nare out there and\nthe ways that we manage them and\n\n17\n00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,680\nthen have to deal with them\non an Apple system, right?\n\n18\n00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,250\nSo let's just start with the basic\nprocess of how we get applications\n\n19\n00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,140\nin the first place.\n\n20\n00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,280\nWell, when you install MAC OS,\n\n21\n00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,890\nit comes with the suite of\napplications already built into it.\n\n22\n00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,330\nSo for example, I've got here\na pretty stock install of Mac OS.\n\n23\n00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,785\nAnd I fired up Yosemite here and\nI've got my calendar.\n\n24\n00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:25,380\nRight?\nI can see when Groundhog's Day is,\n\n25\n00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,210\nthat's very, very exciting stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,540\nI've got things like Safari the web\nbrowser, Apple mail, or iMail or\n\n27\n00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,190\nwhatever you want to call it,\nwhich is their mail client.\n\n28\n00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,680\nWe've got all these other different\napplications and you may have even more.\n\n29\n00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,670\nYou may have things like\nthe iWork Suite installed, so\n\n30\n00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,770\nyou have iPhoto and Pages, and\nall those other guys, Numbers.\n\n31\n00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:51,250\nIf we go into our applications on\nour drive, we can actually go in and\n\n32\n00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,530\nstart to see some of that and\nsee what we've got installed, right?\n\n33\n00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,150\nSo, just a bunch of applications\nthat come with the operating system.\n\n34\n00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,090\nAnd for your average home user,\nthose might be enough.\n\n35\n00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,210\nYou might not need to install\nany other applications.\n\n36\n00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,060\nBut if you're like me,\nyou'll probably install a ton more.\n\n37\n00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,950\nThere's so many other applications we\ncan get out there to provide special\n\n38\n00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,300\nfunctionality that what comes with the\nsystem is not necessarily gonna be enough.\n\n39\n00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,950\nRight.\n\n40\n00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,410\nSo, if we need to get additional programs,\nwhere do we get them from?\n\n41\n00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,260\nWell in Apple land there's really\ntwo different places we can\n\n42\n00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,420\npull that data from.\n\n43\n00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,310\nThe first place is from the app store.\n\n44\n00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,090\nNow the app store originally\nlaunched to support the IOS devices,\n\n45\n00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,875\nthe mobile devices.\n\n46\n00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,870\nRight?\nIt launched on the iPhone and\n\n47\n00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,740\nwhen the iPad came out it was there to, so\n\n48\n00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,150\nthey had the IOS app store where you could\nget all the mobile apps that you wanted.\n\n49\n00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,830\nOn the desktop though,\nyou were left to going and\n\n50\n00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,380\ngetting third party applications.\n\n51\n00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,260\nYou would just go to websites,\nthey would have programs,\n\n52\n00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,880\nyou would download them and install them.\n\n53\n00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,330\nOr you'd go to the store and\nyou'd buy a DVD or\n\n54\n00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,040\nwhatever it was they were selling,\nthe media of the day.\n\n55\n00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,760\nAnd you'd pop that into your computer and\nyou install the software that way.\n\n56\n00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,820\nAnd so Apple said,\nwhy don't we make life easier on people?\n\n57\n00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,430\nWhy don't we go ahead and\ncreate an app store for the desktop also?\n\n58\n00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,010\nAnd, that's exactly what they did.\n\n59\n00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,220\nSo, when you install Yosemite,\nyou'll have the Mac app store.\n\n60\n00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,800\nNow, the Mac app store is\ndifferent than the IOS app store.\n\n61\n00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,990\nThe IOS app store has all the mobile apps,\nand\n\n62\n00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:19,290\nthey don't run on regular Mac,\non OSX, right.\n\n63\n00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,780\nAnd in the Mac app store,\nwe have all of these OS10 apps, and\n\n64\n00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,320\nthey don't run on IOS.\n\n65\n00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,510\nSo they're two completely separate stores,\n\n66\n00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,870\ndon't expect to see the same\napplications when you go into them.\n\n67\n00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,240\nIt's gonna fire up.\n\n68\n00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,180\nAnd I'll see the application\nthey're promoting this week,\n\n69\n00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,660\nas well as various other\napplications I can go in and buy.\n\n70\n00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,150\nAnd they're categorized,\n\n71\n00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,280\nyou can search and find them all\nright here in one easy to use place.\n\n72\n00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,770\nNow I probably don't have to tell\nyou guys about the advantages and\n\n73\n00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,580\ndisadvantages of this.\n\n74\n00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,850\nBut let's just cover it\nto be on the safe side.\n\n75\n00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,760\nThe primary advantage of using\nthe app store is security.\n\n76\n00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,550\nRight?\n\n77\n00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,890\nEvery single application that is in\nthis list has been reviewed by Apple.\n\n78\n00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,160\nApple's looked at it.\n\n79\n00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,220\nMade sure it's a legitimate application.\n\n80\n00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,702\nAnd put it in the app store.\n\n81\n00:04:07,702 --> 00:04:12,570\nAll right, so we know that it's going to\nbe virus free, that it's not malware,\n\n82\n00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,870\nthat it's not spy software.\n\n83\n00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,085\nWe assume, right?\n\n84\n00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:20,270\n[LAUGH] So it's been tested by somebody.\n\n85\n00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,970\nThe other advantage is,\n\n86\n00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,700\nwhen we install software through the app\nstore, it automatically updates.\n\n87\n00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,290\nSo if a new update comes out for\nCore Animator, and\n\n88\n00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,314\nthat's what I have installed.\n\n89\n00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:34,180\nThen it'll update my system to Havoc,\n\n90\n00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,440\nthat another advantage of\ngetting it from the app store.\n\n91\n00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,060\nThere are some disadvantages of\ngetting things from the app store.\n\n92\n00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,710\nFor example, if I'm a software vendor,\nand I wrote my own software package, and\n\n93\n00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,410\nI want to give that out to my customers,\nif I put it in the app store,\n\n94\n00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,530\nthat's a great way to do it.\n\n95\n00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,780\nBut now Apple gets\na percentage of my revenue.\n\n96\n00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,110\nRight?\nThe developers have to pay Apple,\n\n97\n00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,450\nso software is either more\nexpensive in the app store or\n\n98\n00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,840\na lot of developers just choose not to\nput their apps in the app store because\n\n99\n00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,610\nthey don't want to pay Apple\npart of their profits.\n\n100\n00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,580\nRight?\nProfit margins on software is not that\n\n101\n00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,320\ngreat anyway, so.\n\n102\n00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,190\nThey might choose not to do that.\n\n103\n00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,840\nNow the other option though\nis that you can go out and\n\n104\n00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,610\nyou can install applications yourself.\n\n105\n00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,750\nYou can go to a website for somebody and\n\n106\n00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:22,650\nI know earlier in the show I went\nto a Royal TS, that's not it.\n\n107\n00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,990\nA program that I use just all the time.\n\n108\n00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,310\nAnd, oh that was the right web page.\n\n109\n00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,670\nApparently they've changed their\npage since I've been there last.\n\n110\n00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,900\nBut you can go to some\nvendors' web page and\n\n111\n00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,090\ndownload the applications\nright from there.\n\n112\n00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,680\nSo if I want Royal TSX, the Apple version,\nI can just download it and\n\n113\n00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,910\nnow I've got a copy and\nI can install it from there.\n\n114\n00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:41,640\nAll right.\n\n115\n00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,000\nNow on a positive side, it was very easy.\n\n116\n00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,990\nI just went and got it.\n\n117\n00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,490\nRight?\nAnd the vendor they can charge money for\n\n118\n00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,720\nthe application and\nthey get all that money so it helps them.\n\n119\n00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,660\nOn a negative,\nit's not gonna automatically update\n\n120\n00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,080\nunless that developer wrote some kind\nof update functionality in there.\n\n121\n00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,850\nIn the case of Royal TSX, it checks for\nupdates but it won't actually do them.\n\n122\n00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,330\nSo I've gotta go and\ndownload an update when I'm ready,\n\n123\n00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,450\nso that's a little bit more challenging.\n\n124\n00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,650\nThe other thing is,\nif I go to download this application and\n\n125\n00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,140\nit sends me to a mirror site,\nto some other website to download it.\n\n126\n00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,960\nHow do I know I'm getting\nthe actual application and\n\n127\n00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,590\nnot one that's been modified or\ncompromised, right?\n\n128\n00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,940\nWe see that with a lot of software, where\nto save money the developers are using\n\n129\n00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,830\nmirror sites, and you don't know\nwho those mirror companies are.\n\n130\n00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,830\nYou don't know if you can trust them.\n\n131\n00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,960\nSo they might have MD5 checksums along\nwith the download so you can compare to\n\n132\n00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,940\nmake sure the file wasn't tampered with,\nbut that's a lot of burden.\n\n133\n00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,760\nThe app store does it for you, right?\n\n134\n00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,860\nSo pros and cons for going either way.\n\n135\n00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,070\nBoth are supported.\n\n136\n00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,770\nYou can install your\napplications either way.\n\n137\n00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,770\nApple leaves that up to you.\n\n138\n00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,780\nAll right.\n\n139\n00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,710\nBut on the exam, when they talk\nabout downloading applications and\n\n140\n00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,500\ninstalling them, if it's from the app\nstore, they just call it that.\n\n141\n00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500\nInstalling from the app store or\ninstalling an application.\n\n142\n00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,620\nThat's what they're referring to.\n\n143\n00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,720\nIf they just, in general,\nsay you install an application.\n\n144\n00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,510\nYou can assume they mean\nfrom the app store.\n\n145\n00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,790\nWhen they talk about downloading an\napplication from a vendor site like this,\n\n146\n00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,730\nthey refer to that as side loading.\n\n147\n00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,640\nSide loading means you're not using the\napp store, you're coming in from the side\n\n148\n00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,690\nand installing without the app\nstore being involved, all right?\n\n149\n00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,290\nSo on the exam when they say side loading,\n\n150\n00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,080\nthey're referring to you downloaded\nit from a vendor website.\n\n151\n00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,660\nOr got a DVD or whatever and installed\nfrom that media not using the app store.\n\n152\n00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,248\nAll right well,\n\n153\n00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:29,550\nlet's take a look at the process of\ngetting an application from the app store.\n\n154\n00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,470\nFirst thing is,\n\n155\n00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,380\nif you're gonna use the app store,\nyou're going to need an Apple ID.\n\n156\n00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,620\nYou've gotta have an Apple ID to sign in\nand get applications, even the free ones.\n\n157\n00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,090\nNow an Apple ID is free.\n\n158\n00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,010\nSo you can create one and\nget signed in with it.\n\n159\n00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,622\nBut if you want to buy applications,\n\n160\n00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:48,691\nyou'll have to add a credit card to\nyour account to be able to buy them.\n\n161\n00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:52,103\nRight, and there's a number of\napplications in here that are good ones,\n\n162\n00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:55,860\nthat are really useful, there's video\ngames that aren't so terribly useful.\n\n163\n00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,100\nBut there's a lot of stuff in here.\n\n164\n00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,600\nAnd there's plenty of free\nones that are available too.\n\n165\n00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,131\nNow, this is a fairly new install.\n\n166\n00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:03,671\nI just launched it.\n\n167\n00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:06,775\nAnd if I go into the App Store and\nI look for something like TextWrangler.\n\n168\n00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:11,120\nTextWrangler's a little text\neditor that I've used before.\n\n169\n00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,180\nI have a different one that I prefer.\n\n170\n00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,610\nBut this is one that's pretty popular.\n\n171\n00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,080\nI can do a quick search for\nit and there it is.\n\n172\n00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,955\nAnd I can click on it to\nget information about it.\n\n173\n00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:22,340\nScreenshots, I can see what\nversion it's at right now,\n\n174\n00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,020\nwhat's new in the latest update.\n\n175\n00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,310\nYou get all the information you\nneed about the application, and\n\n176\n00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,030\nif you wanna install it,\nyou've got a Get button.\n\n177\n00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,160\nRight there because this one is free.\n\n178\n00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,520\nI want a free application I need to get\nand it will download it and install it.\n\n179\n00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,590\nIf it's not a free application, like I use\nan application called Write, all the time.\n\n180\n00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,070\nThis guy right here.\n\n181\n00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,340\nAnd I, I really like this program and\nit's $10.\n\n182\n00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,490\nSo that's a paid application.\n\n183\n00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,780\nIf I want that I have to click on it and\n\n184\n00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,310\nI'm gonna have a credit card\non my account to buy it.\n\n185\n00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,770\nIf you've already bought it like I have,\nthen that button will just say install,\n\n186\n00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,410\nand you click on it.\n\n187\n00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,860\nAnd it will install\nthe app on your machine.\n\n188\n00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,350\nWhen you buy an application\nfrom the app store.\n\n189\n00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,810\nYou get it and you can install\nit on more than one machine.\n\n190\n00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,710\nAs long as you're logged in with your\nApple ID, you can get it, and install it.\n\n191\n00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,220\nAll right?\n\n192\n00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,850\nAnd we're not gonna tackle\nit this episode, but\n\n193\n00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,860\nApple actually has something\ncalled family sharing.\n\n194\n00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,050\nAnd when you set up your Apple ID\nyou can add your family members\n\n195\n00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,040\nto your account also.\n\n196\n00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,630\nAnd you'll see several applications\nhave a little note down here that says\n\n197\n00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,070\nfamily sharing, yes or no.\n\n198\n00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,970\nAnd if it says yes, then you can share\nthat application with up to five people.\n\n199\n00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,890\nWell I think that's actually counting\nyourself, so it'd be five people total.\n\n200\n00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,200\nSo if you have a husband or wife,\nyou have a couple of children,\n\n201\n00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,470\nthey can each have their own Apple ID.\n\n202\n00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,065\nYou can buy the application once and\nshare it among those users.\n\n203\n00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:43,036\nSo kind of a neat feature there to\nstop you from having to buy over and\n\n204\n00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:44,163\nover again, all right?\n\n205\n00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:49,483\nNow if you don't have an Apple ID, you\ncan go up to your Store menu up here and\n\n206\n00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:52,700\nyou'll see where you\ncan create an account.\n\n207\n00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,350\nThat's where you can create an Apple ID.\n\n208\n00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,500\nYou can do it from Apple's website also.\n\n209\n00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,040\nOr when you install Yosemite it probably\npestered you to create an Apple ID and\n\n210\n00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,900\nlink it to your account and all that.\n\n211\n00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,010\nSo you probably already have one.\n\n212\n00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,010\nIf you don't do create an account.\n\n213\n00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,770\nYou don't have to provide a credit card.\n\n214\n00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,990\nIf you don't provide a credit card you'll\nbe able to get free apps, not paid apps.\n\n215\n00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,970\nThat may be all you need.\n\n216\n00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,320\nIf we want paid apps though,\nwe are gonna add a credit card.\n\n217\n00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,880\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign in with\nan existing account that I've got.\n\n218\n00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,760\nAnd it's just my little lab account\nthat I use here on the show.\n\n219\n00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,080\nAnd let's see if I can\nremember it's password.\n\n220\n00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,490\nYou know always the problem with cloud\naccounts, if you forget the password,\n\n221\n00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,380\nyou've got to go through password reset.\n\n222\n00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,220\nBut there we go, I'm signed in.\n\n223\n00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,510\nAnd so it's letting me know that I've\nnever used this ID with the App Store, and\n\n224\n00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,550\nsince I've never used it\nwith the App Store before,\n\n225\n00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,360\nit's making me review\nthe license agreement.\n\n226\n00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,640\nSo I'll just hit that, and I'll get\nthe license agreement here in a moment.\n\n227\n00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,390\nSo it's just giving me a little\nbit of information, and\n\n228\n00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,330\nhere's the nice, easy to read,\njust super simple agreement.\n\n229\n00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,420\nI'll definitely read all of that and\nthen agree to it.\n\n230\n00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,227\nAll right.\n\n231\n00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:58,650\nIt's prompting me to add a credit card.\n\n232\n00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,560\nIf I want to buy paid applications,\nI'm gonna have to add a credit card here.\n\n233\n00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,320\nOkay.\n\n234\n00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,980\nBut you don't have to.\n\n235\n00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,880\nYou don't have to attach a credit\ncard in order to do this.\n\n236\n00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,870\nIf I want to do pay stuff, I can.\n\n237\n00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,210\nBut if I look down here, you'll see where\nI can hit cancel and not add that card.\n\n238\n00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,189\nAnd that's exactly what I'm gonna do,\nI'm just gonna cancel it.\n\n239\n00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:18,340\nI'm logged in.\n\n240\n00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,160\nIf I go up to my store menu,\nit actually you know what,\n\n241\n00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,100\nit did sign me out, didn't it.\n\n242\n00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,634\nLet me sign back in, then.\n\n243\n00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,105\nHere we go, we'll just get signed in.\n\n244\n00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:31,050\nAnd maybe this time I'll\nhit Continue instead.\n\n245\n00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,715\n[LAUGH] I will get this account created.\n\n246\n00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:36,346\nSo I'll go ahead and hit Continue here.\n\n247\n00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:37,707\nI'll resign my agreement.\n\n248\n00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:39,237\nThere we go.\n\n249\n00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:41,997\nSign away all my rights\nto old Steve Jobs and co.\n\n250\n00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:44,217\nAll right, so\nhere's that credit card screen again, and\n\n251\n00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:46,467\ninstead of hitting cancel,\nI'll just hit continue this time.\n\n252\n00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:48,137\nAnd it's at least asking for a phone,\n\n253\n00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:49,868\nyou'll see that it's\nred flagging me there.\n\n254\n00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:53,578\nAnd up here, the credit card\nhas not red flagged me, right?\n\n255\n00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:56,288\nSo it's not mad at me for\nnot having a credit card, but\n\n256\n00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:59,128\nit does want a phone number here\nI'll put my office phone in here.\n\n257\n00:11:59,128 --> 00:11:59,918\nWhich is that, area code?\n\n258\n00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:03,658\nYeah, so we'll put in the old\noffice number, there we go.\n\n259\n00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,430\nAnd we'll move forward.\n\n260\n00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,864\nAnd we'll get this account set up.\n\n261\n00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:08,559\nAnd I need a title.\n\n262\n00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,468\nSo, I guess I'll be Mr.,\ncould be a doctor I guess.\n\n263\n00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:12,240\nWe could put that in.\n\n264\n00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,300\nAll right.\n\n265\n00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,770\nWell, let me take my computer screen\noff camera for a second, here.\n\n266\n00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,580\nI'm gonna go ahead and punch in a credit\ncard on the account just to go ahead and\n\n267\n00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,580\nget it added.\n\n268\n00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,960\nIt turns out there's actually a little\nbit of a policy that Apple has.\n\n269\n00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,070\nIf you're creating a brand new account,\nthey'll let you choose none for\n\n270\n00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,930\nthe payment and not add a credit card.\n\n271\n00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,690\nThat's what I was trying to do.\n\n272\n00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,730\nBut if you already have an account,\nlike mine,\n\n273\n00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,130\nthat Apple ID already existed, well,\nit makes you put in a credit card.\n\n274\n00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,690\nAnd in the Apple documentation,\n\n275\n00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,190\nit even says where you can remove\nthe credit card after the fact, it's fine.\n\n276\n00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,354\nBut it makes you put it in for\nsign up purposes.\n\n277\n00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:47,940\nSo I just went ahead and\nentered mine in and hit submit.\n\n278\n00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,420\nSo you can see here my Apple ID is\nready to use with the app stores.\n\n279\n00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,900\nNow I can start shopping,\nlet's go buy some stuff.\n\n280\n00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,070\nSo now that I'm in here I can\nstart to find applications,\n\n281\n00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:03,100\nlike I'll go back to old TextWrangler,\nand here's TextWrangler and I can just\n\n282\n00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,970\nhit that get button and it's gonna change\nto an install app because it's free.\n\n283\n00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,593\nIf it was a dollar sign value,\nI'd click on that and\n\n284\n00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:12,980\nI'd have to enter my\npassword again to buy it.\n\n285\n00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,839\nAnd once I had bought it,\nthen we could install the App.\n\n286\n00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,690\nBut I'm going to go ahead and hit that.\n\n287\n00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,030\nIt is now installing.\n\n288\n00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,300\nIt's downloading the application\nfrom Apple servers and\n\n289\n00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,280\ninstalling it on my machine.\n\n290\n00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,010\nSo I know it's coming from a safe and\ntrusted source and\n\n291\n00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,770\nit's installing and\nit should be installed correctly.\n\n292\n00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,920\nThat's assuming I didn't mess anything up.\n\n293\n00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,160\nSo I should have TextWrangler now and\nI can hit open.\n\n294\n00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,370\nIt's gonna fire it up, and here I am.\n\n295\n00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,130\nI'm ready to start writing text documents.\n\n296\n00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,640\nIt's gonna be terribly, terribly exciting.\n\n297\n00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,210\nSo we can go out and\nfind all sorts of applications this way.\n\n298\n00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,960\nThe whole point of the App Store is,\nI guess the whole point is to generate\n\n299\n00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,610\nrevenue for Apple, but the second point\nof the App Store is to give us a safe and\n\n300\n00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,570\ntrusted place to get applications and\nto have them automatically update.\n\n301\n00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,550\nSo we don't have to worry about it.\n\n302\n00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,280\nIt's all about security and safety.\n\n303\n00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,890\nThat's really what we get.\n\n304\n00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,620\nFrom pulling apps like this.\n\n305\n00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,360\nAll right.\n\n306\n00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,670\nThe only problem is if I need an\napplication that's not on the list, right?\n\n307\n00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,120\nI've mentioned Royal TSX.\n\n308\n00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,190\nIt's a program I use every single day.\n\n309\n00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,439\nAnd if I go in here into the App Store and\nI look for\n\n310\n00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,210\nRoyal TSX and search, it's not there.\n\n311\n00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,456\nRight?\n\n312\n00:14:20,456 --> 00:14:22,480\nMaybe I just a need a space or something.\n\n313\n00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,590\nIt's not there.\n\n314\n00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,810\nAnd the reason is\nthe developer only charges.\n\n315\n00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,400\nI think it's like $35 for the program.\n\n316\n00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,305\nIf he were to sell it through the App\nStore, they would want 40% of that, right?\n\n317\n00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,930\nIt's a pretty big chunk of the profits.\n\n318\n00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:38,450\nSo if I want something like Royal TSX,\nI've gotta go and get it from the vendor.\n\n319\n00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,090\nI can go to their website,\nand I can download it.\n\n320\n00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,530\nAnd that's what I've\ndone in the background.\n\n321\n00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,230\nIf I go into my downloads,\nI've already downloaded that DMG,\n\n322\n00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,010\nthat disk image from that.\n\n323\n00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,750\nAnd if I want to install this way,\nthis is side loading.\n\n324\n00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,980\nI'm gonna get that application\ninstalled without using the app store.\n\n325\n00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,860\nI can just double click to get that DMG\nto get it mounted and it's gonna open up.\n\n326\n00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,580\nHe's got a little license\nagreement I have to agree to.\n\n327\n00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,800\nBut then it's gonna melt that image,\nopen it up, and\n\n328\n00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,820\nall I've got to do is drag that\napplication into my applications folder.\n\n329\n00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,360\nAnd this is just an alias right here\nthat points to my applications folder.\n\n330\n00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,140\nAnd if I go into it, there's TextWrangler,\nthat was installed from the app store, and\n\n331\n00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,750\nthere's Royal TSX,\nthat was installed locally as a side load.\n\n332\n00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,960\nAll right?\n\n333\n00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,500\nOnce they're installed,\nthere's really no difference, is there?\n\n334\n00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,770\nWell, the only true difference\none they're installed this way\n\n335\n00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,810\nis that TextWrangler will be\nautomatically updated, Royal TSX won't.\n\n336\n00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,040\nBut aside from that they're\nbasically treated the same.\n\n337\n00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,810\nWell I guess there is\none little difference.\n\n338\n00:15:38,882 --> 00:15:43,740\nYour Mac, your Yosemite will know\nthat this one was downloaded\n\n339\n00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,810\nfrom the internet and it will notice\nthis one came from the app store.\n\n340\n00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,831\nAnd it knows that because\nthere's a digital signature\n\n341\n00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:53,911\nattached to App Store apps, so\nthat Yosemite knows it can trust that app.\n\n342\n00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,407\nIt knows that's a safe app and\nif I run that,\n\n343\n00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:59,860\nit's gonna open it up just fine\nbecause it knows it's safe.\n\n344\n00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,191\nAll right, but if I take an app like\nthis one that I downloaded it from\n\n345\n00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:06,650\nthe internet,\nit doesn't have that digital signature.\n\n346\n00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,523\nAnd so when I go to open it,\nit's gonna see that it's missing that, and\n\n347\n00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:11,642\nit's gonna ask me.\n\n348\n00:16:11,642 --> 00:16:16,730\nIt's gonna say Royal TSX is an application\ndownloaded from the internet.\n\n349\n00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,090\nAre you sure you want to open it, right?\n\n350\n00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,470\nIt's giving me a warning here.\n\n351\n00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,330\nIt's letting me know that this\napplication might not be safe.\n\n352\n00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,550\nDo I trust it?\n\n353\n00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,260\nAnd if I trust it I can just hit open and\nit'll open right up, right?\n\n354\n00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,050\nThis one does have a digital signature,\nsee how its got the website and stuff.\n\n355\n00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,200\nIt's just not a digital\nsignature trusted by Apple.\n\n356\n00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,620\nSo I can open it and\n\n357\n00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,250\ngain access to that application, what\nit's doing here is called the quarantine.\n\n358\n00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,070\nThere's a little quarantine bit\nthat's set on every file you download\n\n359\n00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,220\nfrom the internet and that let's\nthe Mac know that this is different.\n\n360\n00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,670\nRight?\nEven if it's got a perfectly\n\n361\n00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,850\ngood digital signature on it, it's still\ndifferent because you sideloaded it.\n\n362\n00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,290\nAnd you just get this\nsimple little warning.\n\n363\n00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,470\nAll right.\n\n364\n00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,350\nUnder the hood,\nthis is a technology called gatekeeper.\n\n365\n00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,830\nGatekeeeper is part of the Yosemite\noperating system and it's designed for\n\n366\n00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,480\napplication safety.\n\n367\n00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,240\nYou can use Gatekeeper to\nrestrict a machine and\n\n368\n00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,980\nsay that it can only run\napplications from the app store.\n\n369\n00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,174\nIf you want to ensure that you don't get\nmalware, malicious software installed o\n\n370\n00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:19,086\nyour machine that's not safe, you could\nrestrict just the app store apps.\n\n371\n00:17:19,086 --> 00:17:22,385\nNow, it would just be apps that Apple\nhas reviewed, certified as clean,\n\n372\n00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:25,170\npublished, that you know they\nhaven't been tampered with.\n\n373\n00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:29,610\nIt's a great way to lock your system down\nand ensure a high degree of security.\n\n374\n00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,390\nBut if you're like me, and you rely on\napplications that aren't in the app store?\n\n375\n00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,390\nWell, Gatekeeper is a bit of a hindrance.\n\n376\n00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,740\nAnd so we do need to take a look at some\nof the ways we can configure Gatekeeper\n\n377\n00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,520\nand work with that.\n\n378\n00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,810\nBut I'll hold off on that for just now.\n\n379\n00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,510\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit open though,\n\n380\n00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,530\nand that application's gonna open right\nup and there we go, I'm in Royal TSX.\n\n381\n00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,300\nI can start working with it,\nI can setup all my terminal sessions and\n\n382\n00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,400\nremote desktops and VNC and all that good\nstuff, all right here in this software.\n\n383\n00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,900\nDone.\n\n384\n00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,750\nSo not a big deal to run stuff\nlocally versus remotely.\n\n385\n00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,190\nThere is some variations as far\nas getting rid of the software.\n\n386\n00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,180\nRight?\nIf I'm done with this software and\n\n387\n00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,150\nI don't need it anymore, the way we\nuninstall it can be a little interesting,\n\n388\n00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,630\nso I do want to talk about that too.\n\n389\n00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,690\nBut looking at the timer, this is probably\na good spot to stop and take a break.\n\n390\n00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:22,480\nSo when we get back, I want to talk more\nabout Gatekeeper and how it works, and\n\n391\n00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,610\nI wanna walk through\nthe process of uninstalling,\n\n392\n00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,320\nremoving software from our machine and\nkind of show you that process too.\n\n393\n00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,470\nSo stay tuned.\n\n394\n00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,560\nWe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n395\n00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:37,863\n[MUSIC]\n\n396\n00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:38,380\nAll right.\n\n397\n00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,610\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n398\n00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,560\nSo before the break I started talking\na little bit about Gatekeeper, and\n\n399\n00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,250\nhow it works to block those applications\nthat aren't necessarily trust worthy.\n\n400\n00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,220\nI wanna take a minute to show you\nthe behind the scenes of how that works.\n\n401\n00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,850\nI know I mentioned a quarantine bit, but\n\n402\n00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,810\nI didn't really show the true\nfunctionality of that.\n\n403\n00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,960\nSo let me show you a couple\nof neat things that happens\n\n404\n00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960\nwhen you install an application.\n\n405\n00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,830\nSo just to refresh ourselves, before\nthe break I installed Text Wrangler from\n\n406\n00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,820\nthe app store and I installed\nRoyal TSX from the vendor website so\n\n407\n00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,270\nI have an app store installed app and\na side loaded app.\n\n408\n00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,970\nLet's look at the differences\nof those apps.\n\n409\n00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,540\nWhen I browse in the finder, and I go into\nmy applications folder, I can look in\n\n410\n00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,230\nhere and I can find Royal TSX sitting\nright there next to TextWrangler, and\n\n411\n00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,730\nvisually they don't look any different\nto me, as far as apps are concerned.\n\n412\n00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,140\nIf I pull up their information I\nsee the basic data about them.\n\n413\n00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,960\nNothing crazy or special about either one.\n\n414\n00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,780\nJust standard applications\navailable on my system.\n\n415\n00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,220\nWhere we really see things different,\nis if we jump into our terminal, and\n\n416\n00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,660\ntake a look behind the scenes.\n\n417\n00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,450\nAll right?\n\n418\n00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,900\nSo if I dive into my applications folder,\nand\n\n419\n00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,690\nI pull up a long directory listing.\n\n420\n00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,390\nI'm just doing an ls-al.\n\n421\n00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:01,970\nI can find TextWrangler right here,\nand I can find Royal TSX right here.\n\n422\n00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,400\nNow there's some variations\nbetween these apps and\n\n423\n00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,450\nall of the other apps on my system.\n\n424\n00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,670\nIf I take an app like the mail app,\n\n425\n00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:14,400\nhere's the mail program,\nsee how it's flagged as a directory.\n\n426\n00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,330\nWell all applications\nshow up as a directory,\n\n427\n00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,770\nbecause they're actually a bundle\nof a bunch of files combined.\n\n428\n00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,600\nSo all of my programs\nshow up as directories,\n\n429\n00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,710\nI expect that, then I've got read,\nwrite and execute for\n\n430\n00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,910\nthe owner of the file and\nnotice the owner of the file is root.\n\n431\n00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,250\nThat means it's actually owned\nby the operating system,\n\n432\n00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,500\nthat root administrative account\nthat's kind of hidden from us.\n\n433\n00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,590\nThe operating system\ncontrols those applications.\n\n434\n00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,790\nThen I can see it's read and execute for\nthe group, and the group is wheel,\n\n435\n00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,190\nthat's a hidden administrative group\nthat's just for administrative actions.\n\n436\n00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,780\nNow, I'm not logged in as group,\nand I'm not in wheel, so\n\n437\n00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,420\nneither of those apply to me.\n\n438\n00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,110\nSo, it's the third set of permissions\nwhere it's read and execute.\n\n439\n00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,780\nThat's what applies to me.\n\n440\n00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,270\nI'm able to read that\nthe application is there, and\n\n441\n00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,250\nI'm able to execute it, and run it.\n\n442\n00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:00,850\nThat's what I want.\n\n443\n00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,330\nBut then there's a little\nplus sign beside it.\n\n444\n00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,000\nAnd that plus sign means that there's\nsome extended attributes attached to this\n\n445\n00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,160\napplication.\n\n446\n00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,730\nWith a normally installed\napplication in Mac OS,\n\n447\n00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:18,970\nthere is a little flag set on it\nthat denies you from deleting it.\n\n448\n00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:24,297\nI don't see that here but\nif I were to do a ls-le for\n\n449\n00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:30,760\nmail.app and just look at it,\nit will break that down and\n\n450\n00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,530\nactually is that tucked under,\ndid I pick a bad example?\n\n451\n00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,220\nLet's see.\n\n452\n00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,560\nLet's just do an ls-le for\nthe whole thing.\n\n453\n00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,090\nWhat you'll see as you\nstart to look at them.\n\n454\n00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,242\nHere we go.\nHere's mail.app.\n\n455\n00:21:44,242 --> 00:21:47,300\nAnd see that special attribute\nthat it added to it?\n\n456\n00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,870\nGroup everyone, deny, delete.\n\n457\n00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:54,280\nIt won't let me delete an application\nthat's controlled by the operating system.\n\n458\n00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,730\nMailbot app is a part of Yosemite, so\nthere's no reason I should delete it.\n\n459\n00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,260\nAnd so its got that where that\nextended attribute is, all right?\n\n460\n00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,020\nBut look at the apps that I installed.\n\n461\n00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,660\nI installed Royal TSX that was\nthe one I side loaded, all right?\n\n462\n00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,270\nWell for that one, look at the owner.\n\n463\n00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,780\nIt's Don Pezet, it's me.\n\n464\n00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,800\nI'm the owner cuz I installed\nthe application, all right?\n\n465\n00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,720\nAnd i'm in the admin group.\n\n466\n00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,000\nThat's why I was able to install it.\n\n467\n00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,160\nAnd so it shows as the admin group there.\n\n468\n00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,380\nAnd there's no extended attribute but\nthere are some\n\n469\n00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,820\nextra values attached to it with\nthat @ symbol is designating.\n\n470\n00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,200\nThat means there's some\nmetadata attached to this file.\n\n471\n00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,450\nAnd it's there,\nit's got some kind of information,\n\n472\n00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:40,670\nbut there's no denied delete,\nbecause I installed it, I can delete it.\n\n473\n00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,490\nI might want to uninstall the application.\n\n474\n00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,100\nSo, the permissions are different for\nthis application.\n\n475\n00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,990\nThe other thing is it's got that @ symbol.\n\n476\n00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,640\nWhat is that?\n\n477\n00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,520\nWell, if I do an ls-l@,\n\n478\n00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,210\nthat'll show me what that at symbol is,\nwhat the metadata is for that file.\n\n479\n00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,450\nAnd I can find Royal TSX right there.\n\n480\n00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,430\nAnd there is the metadata that's set.\n\n481\n00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,415\nIt's in the quarantine.\n\n482\n00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,490\nCom.Apple.quarantine.\n\n483\n00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,270\nThat's letting me know that it\nwas downloaded from the internet\n\n484\n00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,560\noutside of the app store.\n\n485\n00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,980\nThat's how it's tracking that information.\n\n486\n00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,120\nAnd I can remove that attribute and\n\n487\n00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,620\nthen it wouldn't know that\nit came from the internet.\n\n488\n00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,060\nIt's not a great idea to do that,\nbut you could.\n\n489\n00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,020\nThat's what's telling it,\nthat's how it knows.\n\n490\n00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,340\nIt tracks that metadata.\n\n491\n00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,510\nNow notice TextWrangler down here.\n\n492\n00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,980\nTextWrangler does not have\nany metadata attached to it.\n\n493\n00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,255\nOr even extended attributes.\n\n494\n00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:30,955\nThat matter.\n\n495\n00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:35,995\nIt doesn't have an extended attribute to\nsay everyone can't delete this, all right?\n\n496\n00:23:35,995 --> 00:23:38,695\nBecause it was installed from\nthe app store it's not part of\n\n497\n00:23:38,695 --> 00:23:39,765\nthe operating system.\n\n498\n00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:43,885\nIt's controlled by the OS see it's\ngot root and wheel for its groups for\n\n499\n00:23:43,885 --> 00:23:44,955\nits user and group.\n\n500\n00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:49,085\nBut it can be safely deleted\nbecause it's not part of Yosemite.\n\n501\n00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:51,505\nIt didn't ship with that base install.\n\n502\n00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:52,750\nSo we can delete it.\n\n503\n00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,950\nBut it's not in the quarantine\nbecause it came from the app store.\n\n504\n00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,010\nSo that's how it's\ntracking this information.\n\n505\n00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,689\nThat's how it knows what's going on, and\n\n506\n00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:04,901\nknows that it's okay for\nthis application to run.\n\n507\n00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:10,590\nAnother thing is, I installed Royal TSX\nby dragging it to my Applications folder.\n\n508\n00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,020\nThat's the Applications folder for\nthe whole computer.\n\n509\n00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,370\nSo if any other user logs in,\nthey'll see Royal TSX.\n\n510\n00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,750\nAnd the Everyone group has read and\nexecute right there.\n\n511\n00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,150\nSo that means they'll be able to\nrun it and use the application.\n\n512\n00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,530\nIf I want the application\nto be available just for\n\n513\n00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,750\nme, I shouldn't have put it\nin this Applications folder.\n\n514\n00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,360\nAlright.\n\n515\n00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,300\nInstead, you can create an applications\nfolder in your own user profile and\n\n516\n00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,460\nstick it there.\n\n517\n00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,210\nThen the program will be available for\nyou and no one else.\n\n518\n00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,320\nRight.\n\n519\n00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,220\nSo, if I were to browse to my applications\nfolder and find Royal TSX and\n\n520\n00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:53,580\nI am going to open up another finder\nwindow and I'll go to my home directory.\n\n521\n00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,900\nNotice in my home directory,\nI don't have an applications folder, but\n\n522\n00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,750\nI can make one,\nI can just do a new folder.\n\n523\n00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,940\nAnd I can call it Applications.\n\n524\n00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,820\nAnd when I do that,\nit recognizes what I'm doing.\n\n525\n00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,420\nSee how the icon just changed to have\nthe A made out of pencils in there?\n\n526\n00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:15,120\nIt knows that I just made my own personal\napplications folder, special folder.\n\n527\n00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,040\nAnd, if I go in there, I can take\nold Royal TSX and throw it in there.\n\n528\n00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,380\nAnd see how it made an alias of it, right?\n\n529\n00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:29,410\nIt made an alias because we don't need to\nhave two copies of the application, do we?\n\n530\n00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:29,930\nRight?\n\n531\n00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,140\nSo it's just saying well you\nwanted to put it in your own,\n\n532\n00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,410\nbut we'll just link to that main one.\n\n533\n00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,700\nSo that's what it's gonna do there, but\n\n534\n00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,500\nif I delete that,\nI'll just move it to the trash.\n\n535\n00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,880\nAnd I can do the same thing here,\nI can move that one to the trash.\n\n536\n00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,290\nThat's how we uninstall a side-loaded app,\nright?\n\n537\n00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,740\nWe just throw it away.\n\n538\n00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,520\nI just threw away Royal TSX,\nit's no longer installed on my computer.\n\n539\n00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,170\nBut now I can go back to the DMG\nfile where I downloaded the thing.\n\n540\n00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:59,870\nI can open that up and\ninstead of dragging it and\n\n541\n00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,180\ndropping it to my computer's\nApplications folder.\n\n542\n00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,990\nI can drag and drop it to my\npersonal Applications folder.\n\n543\n00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,780\nAnd so I'll throw it in there.\n\n544\n00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,780\nAnd it's gonna copy it down.\n\n545\n00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,060\nThere we go.\n\n546\n00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,660\nJust had to be a little patient.\n\n547\n00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,160\nNow, it's installed just for me.\n\n548\n00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,000\nIt's not installed for\neverybody, just my user account.\n\n549\n00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,230\nAnd if I were to go into like my launch\npad or mission control or whatever.\n\n550\n00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,410\nI'll see it right there,\nin line with all my other applications.\n\n551\n00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:31,530\nI don't know that it's necessarily stored\nin my folder or the computer's folder, but\n\n552\n00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,450\nif a different user logs in,\nthey won't have it.\n\n553\n00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,130\nAlright.\n\n554\n00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,390\nLet me show you that [COUGH] whoops.\n\n555\n00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,310\nIf i were to switch users, actually\nI don't have any other users do I?\n\n556\n00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,870\nLet me whip up another user real quick.\n\n557\n00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,130\nI'll add a quick Jane Doe or something.\n\n558\n00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,420\nAnd we'll log in as that other user and\n\n559\n00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,920\nthey won't see Royal TSX because\nit's tied to my account.\n\n560\n00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:59,042\nSo we'll just do Jane Doe, and\nwe'll hold off on iCloud for her.\n\n561\n00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,120\nAll right, we'll get that created.\n\n562\n00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,640\nAnd now I'm just gonna\nswitch over to her account.\n\n563\n00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,610\nAnd this will be the first\ntime she's logged in so\n\n564\n00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,530\nit's gonna pester me about iCloud and\nstuff.\n\n565\n00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,031\nI'll just cancel that and get logged in.\n\n566\n00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:20,109\nAnd then we'll see what\napplications she sees.\n\n567\n00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,420\nNow when she logs in,\n\n568\n00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,450\nshe'll have access to all of the stuff\nthat was installed for the system.\n\n569\n00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,970\nWhen I installed TextWrangler,\nthat was just for me, right?\n\n570\n00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,040\nWell, not really.\n\n571\n00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,920\nI used the app store and\nI was logged in with my Apple ID, but\n\n572\n00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,870\nit put it in the global\napplications folder.\n\n573\n00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,810\nSo when she logs in and\nshe goes into Launchpad, will she see it?\n\n574\n00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,360\nWell, she doesn't.\n\n575\n00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,960\nIt's in that global applications folder.\n\n576\n00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,580\nShe should see it.\n\n577\n00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,390\nBut the permissions on the file\nare written such that she's not the owner.\n\n578\n00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,830\nAnd actually in that one I\nthink everyone was read.\n\n579\n00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,130\nSo everybody should be able to watch it.\n\n580\n00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:56,690\nIt's a free app.\n\n581\n00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,040\nThere's no reason not to.\n\n582\n00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,700\nSo, it may be that my Launchpad\njust hasn't updated to reflect it.\n\n583\n00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,900\nLet's see.\n\n584\n00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,050\nIf she goes into applications and\nlooks, there's TextWrangler.\n\n585\n00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,160\nAnd if she runs it,\nthere it goes, it runs.\n\n586\n00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,390\nShe has the read access to it.\n\n587\n00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,890\nMy Launchpad just hasn't updated\nto reflect that app yet.\n\n588\n00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,530\nIt'll get it sooner or later.\n\n589\n00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,470\nThere it is.\n\n590\n00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,466\nIt's free, she's got it,\nshe can run it and it's available, but\n\n591\n00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:22,622\nif she looks in the application folder for\nRoyal TSX,\n\n592\n00:28:22,622 --> 00:28:27,113\nthat doesn't show up because that was\npart of my account now, not hers, and\n\n593\n00:28:27,113 --> 00:28:33,011\nher Launchppad, which granted doesn't even\nshow tech doesn't show Royal TSX either,\n\n594\n00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,110\nand if she searches for\nit, it doesn't come up.\n\n595\n00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,760\nSo that kind of shows how these\nthings can be compartmentalized.\n\n596\n00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,430\nNow If I gave her access to my\napplications folder, she could run it from\n\n597\n00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:50,780\nthere, which I'm pretty sure she doesn't\nhave by default, but we could always see.\n\n598\n00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,620\nOops.\n\n599\n00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,040\nLet me get into my finder here, and\n\n600\n00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,850\nI'll try and see if I can\nmanually jump over to that one.\n\n601\n00:28:58,512 --> 00:29:03,530\nSo if she were to browse into my folder,\nshe'll have access to my public folder,\n\n602\n00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,110\nand notice my Applications\nfolder is public also.\n\n603\n00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,070\nThe default permissions for this folder is\nthat it's public, and she can browse in\n\n604\n00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:14,690\nthere, and there's Royal TSX and\nshe can run it from inside of my profile.\n\n605\n00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,610\nAnd it's warning her that it was\ndownloaded from the internet,\n\n606\n00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,670\ndo I want to allow it?\n\n607\n00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,920\nAnd she can open it up.\n\n608\n00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,290\nAnd have access to it.\n\n609\n00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,150\nIf I don't want other people to\nhave access to my applications\n\n610\n00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,640\nI'll need to change the permissions\non that folder to prevent that.\n\n611\n00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,890\nBut the default permissions for\n\n612\n00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,340\nit are going to be that other\npeople have read access to it.\n\n613\n00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,790\nIt just won't show up if they search for\napplications.\n\n614\n00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,710\nAnd things like that.\n\n615\n00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,370\nNow, I'd mentioned that deleting an\napplication was as easy as dragging it and\n\n616\n00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,900\ndropping it in the trash.\n\n617\n00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,460\nAnd for the most part, that's true.\n\n618\n00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,920\nIf I take one of these applications and\n\n619\n00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,923\nI throw it away,\nthat's the end of it, right?\n\n620\n00:29:47,923 --> 00:29:49,830\nIt It's uninstalled and it's gone.\n\n621\n00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:55,920\nWell, that's true for the most part, but\nbe aware that when you run an application,\n\n622\n00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,900\nit will oftentimes create files in other\nplaces on your hard drive at a minimum,\n\n623\n00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,820\nit's going to create preference files, so\nI'll have preferences that are saved for\n\n624\n00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,170\nthat application.\n\n625\n00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,540\nWhen you throw that application in\nthe trash, the preferences stay behind.\n\n626\n00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,750\nThey remain.\n\n627\n00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,145\nSo if I were to reinstall\nthat application later on,\n\n628\n00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,190\nit'll remember all of my old settings.\n\n629\n00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,930\nSo there might be other files that go\nalong with it that need to come out\n\n630\n00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:23,280\ntoo if you want to have a true,\nclean, uninstall.\n\n631\n00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,250\nUnfortunately when you side load an app\nlike this, unless they provide you with\n\n632\n00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,820\nan uninstaller, they don't normally do a\ngood job of cleaning up after themselves.\n\n633\n00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,720\nWith the app store apps they do.\n\n634\n00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,770\nThey do a better job of doing that.\n\n635\n00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,140\nNot if you drag and drop it.\n\n636\n00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,480\nSo if I wanted to get rid of TextWrangler,\nif I were just to go into my applications\n\n637\n00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,920\nfolder and drag TextWrangler,\nand throw it in the trash.\n\n638\n00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,510\nIt would be just like what I\nsaw a moment ago with Royal TSX\n\n639\n00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,340\nthat leaves the preferences behind,\nbut for\n\n640\n00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,400\nour app store app there's actually\nanother way we can install them.\n\n641\n00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:02,070\nIf you fire up your Launchpad and you find\nthe app, if you click and hold on the app.\n\n642\n00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,280\nJust like on the iPhone or iPad all\nof your apps start to jiggle, right,\n\n643\n00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,730\nthey start kind of wiggling on the screen.\n\n644\n00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:12,740\nAnd you'll see an x on any app\nstore app that you can remove.\n\n645\n00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,330\nAnd all you have to do is click that x and\nit'll do a good clean uninstall of that.\n\n646\n00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,260\nIt's gonna delete the application.\n\n647\n00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,720\nGive us a clean removal, and\nthen we'll be back in business.\n\n648\n00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,130\nWhen somebody creates an app and\n\n649\n00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,340\nputs it in Apple App Store, one of\nthe things they have to do is they have to\n\n650\n00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,600\nspecify all the different files\nthat are a part of that app.\n\n651\n00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,722\nSo, that's how it knows what to clean up,\nwhat to remove.\n\n652\n00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,780\nAll right, so that's installing the apps,\nuninstalling the apps.\n\n653\n00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,780\nGate Keeper.\n\n654\n00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,240\nLet's talk a little bit\nmore about Gate Keeper.\n\n655\n00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,760\nI mentioned in the first segment that if\nI wanted, I could lock my system down so\n\n656\n00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,060\nthat it would only run apps\nthat came from the App Store.\n\n657\n00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,700\nAll right?\n\n658\n00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,350\nIt's pretty easy to do.\n\n659\n00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,140\nIf we go into our System Preferences.\n\n660\n00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,511\nInside of our System Preferences you'll\nsee all your different stuff in here.\n\n661\n00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:03,151\nAnd what I'm looking for\nis Security & Privacy.\n\n662\n00:32:03,151 --> 00:32:04,320\nThis guy right here.\n\n663\n00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,639\nAnd if we go into Security & Privacy,\nRight on its main screen,\n\n664\n00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:10,471\nyou have this section right at the bottom,\nall rIght?\n\n665\n00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,370\nThis is gatekeeper, all right?\n\n666\n00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,370\nIt doesn't say Gatekeeper, but\nthat's what the technology is.\n\n667\n00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,430\nYou'll see where we can restrict\nthe computer to only running apps\n\n668\n00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,690\nfrom the App Store or allow it to\nrun apps from the App Store and\n\n669\n00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,360\nfrom identified developers.\n\n670\n00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,890\nIn other words, developers that at\nleast put a digital signature on their\n\n671\n00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,150\napp, all right.\n\n672\n00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:32,120\nBut if they didn't put a digital\nsignature, it's going to be bought.\n\n673\n00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,110\nAnd then the last option is\nto run apps from anywhere.\n\n674\n00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,850\nWe don't care.\nWe don't check for signatures or whatever.\n\n675\n00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,180\nWe just leave it up to you.\n\n676\n00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,310\nYou can run whatever you want.\n\n677\n00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,420\nRight.\n\n678\n00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,810\nSo if I want to turn those options on,\nI can click the lock to unlock it,\n\n679\n00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:47,050\ncuz you've got to be an administrator\nto change this option.\n\n680\n00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,290\nAnd I'm gonna lock this computer down\nto just App Store apps, all right?\n\n681\n00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,509\nSo I'll choose that Mac App Store and\nthat's set and I'll just go ahead and\n\n682\n00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:54,082\nclose this.\n\n683\n00:32:56,137 --> 00:32:56,797\nAll right.\n\n684\n00:32:56,797 --> 00:33:00,268\nAnd, from here,\nif I go back into my App Store and\n\n685\n00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:05,300\nI find TextWrangler, all right,\nlet's go ahead and find it again.\n\n686\n00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:05,800\nThere we go.\n\n687\n00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,460\nI'm going to go ahead and\nreinstall it on my machine.\n\n688\n00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:15,880\nSo I'm installing good old TextWrangler,\nand, let's see, there was an error.\n\n689\n00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,923\nWell, isn't that awesome?\n\n690\n00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:20,210\nOh, but then it installed, perfect.\n\n691\n00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,163\nSo I've got TextWrangler and if I try and\n\n692\n00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:24,299\nopen it [LAUGH] let's\nsee what happens here.\n\n693\n00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:30,690\nLet's go back into my Applications and\nsee if it actually did install.\n\n694\n00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:31,710\nYeah, there it is.\n\n695\n00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,320\nAll right.\n\n696\n00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,342\nAnd if I open it up, there we go.\n\n697\n00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:35,940\nSo TextWrangler is working the way\nthat I would expect it to.\n\n698\n00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,240\nAll right?\n\n699\n00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,730\nBut let's take another app, one that\nwasn't downloaded from the App Store.\n\n700\n00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,100\nI downloaded another app called Spectacle.\n\n701\n00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,940\nThis is one that I use.\n\n702\n00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,650\nIt gives you keyboard shortcuts for\nmoving your windows around on the screen.\n\n703\n00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:53,070\nSo, I've downloaded this application\nfrom the web and if I try and open that,\n\n704\n00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,590\nSpectacle can't be opened because it was\nnot downloaded from a Mac App Store.\n\n705\n00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,260\nIt's telling me I'm not allowed.\n\n706\n00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,130\nAnd, it doesn't give me\nan option to bypass it.\n\n707\n00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:02,720\nDoes it?\n\n708\n00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,200\nIt says if I want to bypass it,\nI've got to go and\n\n709\n00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,660\nchange the option on my computer,\nall right.\n\n710\n00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,590\nThere are ways that you can\noverride these settings, sometimes.\n\n711\n00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,820\nLike if I had chosen to do the option\nto only do identified developers, and\n\n712\n00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,220\nI had an app from\nan unidentified developer.\n\n713\n00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,620\nYou can actually right click on it and\nchoose open, and\n\n714\n00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,360\nit'll bypass that if\nyou're an administrator.\n\n715\n00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,520\nIt'll prompt you for\nadministrative credentials.\n\n716\n00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,460\nIn this case, if I do that,\nI right click on it and I hit open.\n\n717\n00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,610\nSee how I do have that extra option?\n\n718\n00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,320\nI'm overriding that setting.\n\n719\n00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,720\nI could go and\nturn the option off in my preferences, but\n\n720\n00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,240\nif it's a one time thing,\nI can do it right here.\n\n721\n00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,040\nI had to control click or right click,\ndepending on your mouse or touch pad and\n\n722\n00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,820\nthen choose open and then I'll be able to\nhit this open button and bypass it, but\n\n723\n00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,700\nyou've got to be\nan administrator to do that.\n\n724\n00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,179\nSo here it is, now I'm running Spectacle,\n\n725\n00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:52,200\neven though I had blocked\nthat in my options, right?\n\n726\n00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,749\nSo just be aware that you can, indeed,\ndo that, you can bypass stuff.\n\n727\n00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:01,832\nAll right, now in the chat\nroom we had a question about,\n\n728\n00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:04,720\nwhat about the ones you\ncan't remove in Launchpad?\n\n729\n00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,070\nRight.\nSo when I went into Launchpad,\n\n730\n00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,340\nI held my mouse down on an app\nuntil they started to jiggle and\n\n731\n00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,500\nthen I had to X on the app to remove.\n\n732\n00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,790\nAll of these guys don't have Xs,\nbecause they're packaged with Yosemite and\n\n733\n00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,130\nyou're not allowed to remove them.\n\n734\n00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:19,740\nOkay?\n\n735\n00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,610\nIf you remove them,\nit's considered damaging the install, and\n\n736\n00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,910\nApple doesn't let you do that.\n\n737\n00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:28,810\nThese are all the ones that had the\ndenied-delete permissions set on the file.\n\n738\n00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,310\nSo that's why they don't have them.\n\n739\n00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,970\nAny app that I install will have that,\nright?\n\n740\n00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,100\nLet me show you my actual laptop, right.\n\n741\n00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,640\nThat's my little lab laptop for\nthe show, but if I,\n\n742\n00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:46,010\nlet me just minimize all this stuff here,\nget down to my desktop.\n\n743\n00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,210\nSo much stuff open on my desktop.\n\n744\n00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,760\nJust get all these stuff shrunk.\n\n745\n00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,512\nThere we go.\n\n746\n00:35:50,512 --> 00:35:56,070\nAll right, so if we take my laptop here\nand I'll fire up my launch pad, so you'll\n\n747\n00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,980\nsee all these different applications\nthat I have installed and if I\n\n748\n00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,260\njust hold my mouse down and we'll let them\njiggle, see how a lot of them have the Xs,\n\n749\n00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,130\neven things like iMovie and iPhoto,\nI downloaded those from the App Store.\n\n750\n00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,910\nThey didn't come with Yosemite,\n\n751\n00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:15,650\nI got them free because of Yosemite,\nbut they didn't come with Yosemite.\n\n752\n00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,736\nSo, most of this stuff up here like Mail\nand Contacts, I can't delete those, but\n\n753\n00:36:19,736 --> 00:36:23,705\nall these other guys, like Microsoft\nDesktop, Logitech Unifying Software,\n\n754\n00:36:23,705 --> 00:36:27,370\nExcom, that kind of stuff,\nI can delete those, that's fine.\n\n755\n00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,180\nBut the other things,\nthey're kinda stuck, right.\n\n756\n00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:33,749\nOkay.\n\n757\n00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:36,090\nSo, let's see, what was the?\n\n758\n00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,610\n[LAUGH] Oh, the other question was, what's\nthe secret to get launchpad to refresh?\n\n759\n00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,790\nAnd, you know, honestly, I don't know.\n\n760\n00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,270\nLaunchpad kinda refreshes on\nits own from time-to-time.\n\n761\n00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,950\nAnd I'm not sure what the trick\nis to get it to force refresh.\n\n762\n00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,390\nThere's probably something that you could\ndo to make it happen but I don't know it.\n\n763\n00:36:56,218 --> 00:37:00,130\nAll right, so that's basically the things\nwe need to know about applications,\n\n764\n00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,640\nwhether we load them directly or\nsideload them.\n\n765\n00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,360\nI guess the only other thing worth\nmentioning are the automatic updates.\n\n766\n00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,270\nIf you install an app from the App Store,\nit can automatically update, and\n\n767\n00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,530\nthat's kinda a nice feature.\n\n768\n00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,120\nRight?\n\n769\n00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,920\nWell, we can control that up\nin our system preferences.\n\n770\n00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,490\nIf you go into your system preferences,\nsorry,\n\n771\n00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,530\nlet me get rid of these\nother windows I've got open.\n\n772\n00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,360\nWhat is Spectacle doing?\n\n773\n00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,520\nThere we go.\n\n774\n00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,270\nAll right.\n\n775\n00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,500\nSo if I get into my\nsystem preferences here,\n\n776\n00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,280\nyou'll see that we've got a system\npreference for the App Store.\n\n777\n00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,690\nAnd if you go into the App Store,\nit's got automatically check for updates.\n\n778\n00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,180\nIt's gonna automatically look for\nupdates for my applications.\n\n779\n00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,070\nSo if I installed an old version, or\n\n780\n00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,340\nit's just been a while,\nit'll let me know there's an update.\n\n781\n00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,490\nBut you can actually tell it to download\nthe updates in the background, to install\n\n782\n00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:54,830\nthe updates, don't wait for me, just go\nahead and update, go ahead and do it.\n\n783\n00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,860\nInstall Mac OS updates,\nupdates to the base operating system so\n\n784\n00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,720\nwhen the next version comes out,\nit automatically updates.\n\n785\n00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,740\nYou can turn that on.\n\n786\n00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,210\nSo these are some nice little features\nto get it to automatically do that and\n\n787\n00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,630\nput it in place.\n\n788\n00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,590\nAnother option I like is this last one.\n\n789\n00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,950\nAutomatically download apps\npurchased on other Macs.\n\n790\n00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,860\nThat way if I go to another Mac, and I\nbuy an app, it'll install in both places.\n\n791\n00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,110\nThat's kind of a nice feature, too.\n\n792\n00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,751\nIt's just ready and\navailable wherever you go.\n\n793\n00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,715\nAll right, well I know I haven't covered\nanything earth shattering here as far as\n\n794\n00:38:25,715 --> 00:38:27,370\ngetting applications installed.\n\n795\n00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:30,630\nMost of that should be stuff that\nyou guys are already familiar with,\n\n796\n00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,500\nbut we got a chance to see\ngetting it installed and so on.\n\n797\n00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,050\nThere's one other thing, I wanna\nmention before we wrap up this part and\n\n798\n00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:43,160\nmove into our next set,\nwhich is the dashboard.\n\n799\n00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,450\nInside of Mac OS,\nwe have this new dashboard.\n\n800\n00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,700\nI'm not a big fan of it,\nI never use it, but it is there.\n\n801\n00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,470\nIt's something you need to be aware of.\n\n802\n00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,990\nIf I fire up my dashboard.\n\n803\n00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,180\nFor most people,\nif you just like three finger swipe,\n\n804\n00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,050\nit's all the way on the left\nside of your desktop.\n\n805\n00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,310\nOr you can use control\nleft arrow to get there.\n\n806\n00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,930\nI'm in a virtual machine so\nthose don't work for me.\n\n807\n00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,480\nThat's why I launched it manually.\n\n808\n00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,310\nBut, this is my dashboard.\n\n809\n00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:11,660\nAnd the dashboard is designed to give you\naccess to information that's timely and\n\n810\n00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,290\navailable, right?\n\n811\n00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,950\nSo, I see things like a calendar,\nthe weather, a clock, and a calculator.\n\n812\n00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:16,880\nVery exciting, right?\n\n813\n00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,630\nThese are programs.\n\n814\n00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,670\nThese are apps.\n\n815\n00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,880\nWe don't think of them as apps\nbecause they are widgets stuck in\n\n816\n00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,900\nthis little screen.\n\n817\n00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,570\nBut each of these is\nactually an application.\n\n818\n00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,450\nI'm running a calculator application, and\n\n819\n00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:34,170\na little weather application,\nand a clock, and a calendar.\n\n820\n00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:38,050\nEach one's running independently, they're\njust being rendered here in the dashboard.\n\n821\n00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,522\nSo these are another type of\napplication we need to be aware of, and\n\n822\n00:39:41,522 --> 00:39:44,439\nwe need to be aware of from\na security standpoint, too.\n\n823\n00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:48,747\nBecause our end users can add applications\nto this, they can come in here and\n\n824\n00:39:48,747 --> 00:39:51,775\nhit the little plus sign at\nthe bottom of the screen and\n\n825\n00:39:51,775 --> 00:39:55,639\nthey can add in widgets that do all\nsorts of crazy stuff, all right?\n\n826\n00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:56,391\nSo I'll see,\n\n827\n00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:59,848\nthat is the slowest refreshing\nscreen in the history of screens.\n\n828\n00:39:59,848 --> 00:40:04,061\nWell anyhow, so we can add in widgets,\nI can add in ESPN scores here or\n\n829\n00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:06,230\nflight trackers, and so on.\n\n830\n00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:09,903\nThese are widgets that are from Apple,\nand these are a pretty safe, right?\n\n831\n00:40:09,903 --> 00:40:13,010\nIt'd be hard to say that\none of these was malicious.\n\n832\n00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,260\nYou know, that is just so slow.\n\n833\n00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:20,050\nLet me switch to my actual desktop here,\nwe'll pull it up here, there we go.\n\n834\n00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,950\nActually I have, whoops.\n\n835\n00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,212\nI've already got the ESPN one added there.\n\n836\n00:40:24,212 --> 00:40:26,434\nBut I've got each of these widgets,\nthey're running,\n\n837\n00:40:26,434 --> 00:40:27,910\nthey are separate programs.\n\n838\n00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,150\nWe can hit our plus sign, and\nwe can pick what we wanna add.\n\n839\n00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:33,070\nMaybe I want the tile game,\ngotta have my tile game right?\n\n840\n00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,595\nAnd you can throw that in and\nstart to to use it.\n\n841\n00:40:35,595 --> 00:40:37,025\nIt's incredibly exciting.\n\n842\n00:40:37,025 --> 00:40:37,825\nRight?\n\n843\n00:40:37,825 --> 00:40:43,045\nWell, if a user adds a custom application\nto this list, one that's not here,\n\n844\n00:40:43,045 --> 00:40:46,765\nIf we hit that plus sign there's a button\nat the bottom that says more widgets.\n\n845\n00:40:46,765 --> 00:40:49,357\nAnd they can hit more and\nit'll take them to a web page\n\n846\n00:40:49,357 --> 00:40:53,157\nwhere they can start to add in other\nones from the Internet, right?\n\n847\n00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:57,127\nAnd you can even download ones\nyourself and install them.\n\n848\n00:40:57,127 --> 00:41:00,467\nThey end up, if we go into our,\ninto terminal.\n\n849\n00:41:01,803 --> 00:41:05,168\nThe widgets end up in a couple\nof different folders.\n\n850\n00:41:05,168 --> 00:41:10,438\nThere's /Library/Widgets, right?\n\n851\n00:41:10,438 --> 00:41:13,713\nThis is where the ones from Apple\ncome from, they're right there.\n\n852\n00:41:13,713 --> 00:41:16,073\nBut the users can install\nthem in their own folder too.\n\n853\n00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:22,766\nSo, if I go to like\n/Users/donpezet/Library/Widgets,\n\n854\n00:41:22,766 --> 00:41:24,110\nall right.\n\n855\n00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,650\nOh, I don't have it.\n\n856\n00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,760\nThey can go to the library and they can\ncreate a widgets folder if they don't have\n\n857\n00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,140\none already, so I'll just make one.\n\n858\n00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,200\nAnd now I can download widgets from third\nparty sites, and throw them in here, and\n\n859\n00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,840\nthey'll run with my dashboard.\n\n860\n00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,950\nWell, are those safe?\n\n861\n00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,120\nAre they trusted?\n\n862\n00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,720\nAre they ones that we want to allow?\n\n863\n00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,950\nThat can be a little dangerous right?\n\n864\n00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:46,100\nSo we have to be aware that the dashboard,\nthere's still applications right?\n\n865\n00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,060\nFortunately, Gatekeeper applies to widgets\njust like it does regular applications,\n\n866\n00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,170\nso if they download it\nthey've got to approve it.\n\n867\n00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:55,419\nBut just be aware that it\nisn't another type of program.\n\n868\n00:41:55,419 --> 00:41:58,564\nAnd the way we uninstall those is\nby dragging them to the trash.\n\n869\n00:41:58,564 --> 00:42:01,365\nWe can throw them away if\nthey're ones we've downloaded.\n\n870\n00:42:01,365 --> 00:42:04,505\nIf they're ones that we got from Apple,\nlike that ESPN one,\n\n871\n00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:07,750\nwell you just delete it from the dashboard\nscreen and that knocks it out.\n\n872\n00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,470\nBut you can't actually\ndelete the application.\n\n873\n00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,040\nIt stays on the hard drive because\nit's considered part of the OS.\n\n874\n00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,370\nAll right, so those are widgets and\nthat's about that.\n\n875\n00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:21,338\nI can't think of anything else\nexciting to say about them.\n\n876\n00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:24,800\nAll right, well that's about all I've\ngot for installing, supporting and\n\n877\n00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,360\nin removing applications.\n\n878\n00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,970\nWe still have a tun of other things to\ntalk about in this section that are kind\n\n879\n00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:35,588\nof more fringe type topics, things like\nthe quick look functionality, autosave,\n\n880\n00:42:35,588 --> 00:42:38,790\nresume, Java applications and so on.\n\n881\n00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,440\nBut, this is a good spot to stop for\nthis episode.\n\n882\n00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,454\nSo let's wrap it up right here,\nstay tuned,\n\n883\n00:42:43,454 --> 00:42:47,111\ncuz we're gonna have a part two where we\njump into all the additional technologies\n\n884\n00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:48,761\nthat are kind of a mixed bag of stuff.\n\n885\n00:42:48,761 --> 00:42:51,410\nSo we'll get a chance to see\nthose in the next episode.\n\n886\n00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:55,960\nAll right, let me remind you guys if you\nhave questions on anything that I covered,\n\n887\n00:42:55,960 -->

00:00:37,490\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,900\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,060\nback again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n6\n00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,460\nIn our last episode, we got a chance\nto see installing applications and\n\n7\n00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,070\nuninstalling applications,\nworking with those programs.\n\n8\n00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,880\nIn this episode, we're gonna talk about\nthe data that those programs generate.\n\n9\n00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,130\nEvery app that you install inside of Mac\nOS is gonna generate some kind of data.\n\n10\n00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,560\nAt a minimum,\nit's gonna generate a preferences file.\n\n11\n00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,980\nA file that stores settings that\nreflect what that program does or\n\n12\n00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,670\nhas set, all right.\n\n13\n00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,890\nYou know the preferences,\nthe options that we flag inside of it.\n\n14\n00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,400\nBut more commonly, the programs you\nrun are gonna generate actual data,\n\n15\n00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,640\nlike text documents,\nimages, photos, music,\n\n16\n00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,448\nwhatever it is that your programs make,\nthey'll generate files for that, too.\n\n17\n00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:29,020\nSo, I wanna highlight some of\nthe things that we want to be aware of\n\n18\n00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,890\nwith that data.\n\n19\n00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,908\nAnd some of the neat stuff we can do\nwith that data once it's on our system,\n\n20\n00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:34,800\nall right.\n\n21\n00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,520\nLet's start with preferences?\n\n22\n00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,560\nIf our system is running applications,\n\n23\n00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,170\neach user might use those\napplications a different way.\n\n24\n00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,600\nSo when they launch an application they\nmight wanna customize the user interface,\n\n25\n00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,250\nchange the way things are laid out.\n\n26\n00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,040\nWell, the programs remember that.\n\n27\n00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,000\nAnd they remember that\nby tracking preferences.\n\n28\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,970\nThe preferences are stored in a file\nin the hard drive which is called\n\n29\n00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,258\na p-list file, it's short for\npreference list.\n\n30\n00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:03,490\nAnd the p-list files are these little\nbinary files that contain all of\n\n31\n00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,090\nthose settings and options.\n\n32\n00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,130\nThere's typically one generic p-list\nfile that's the default settings,\n\n33\n00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,650\nand that's located in\n/library/preferences, right.\n\n34\n00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,930\nSo, it's on the root of the hard\ndrive in that global settings area.\n\n35\n00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,080\nBut then, each individual user will\ntypically have a preference file also,\n\n36\n00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,410\nso that every user can set\nthe program up a different way,\n\n37\n00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,540\nand they might override each other.\n\n38\n00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,180\nJust remember that the user's\npreference file is the one that wins,\n\n39\n00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,190\nthat will override the global\npreference file if one exists.\n\n40\n00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,520\nSometimes a global preference\nfile doesn't even exist because\n\n41\n00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,200\nit knows each user will have their own,\nright.\n\n42\n00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,808\nLet me show you what I'm talking about,\nall right.\n\n43\n00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:46,950\nIf I have a program,\nlike the VLC video player.\n\n44\n00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,330\nSo, here on my laptop I have the VLC\nvideo player, and I can go in and\n\n45\n00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,930\nI can customize its options.\n\n46\n00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,065\nIf I go into my VLC menu up here, and\ngo to Preferences I'll see all these\n\n47\n00:02:57,065 --> 00:03:00,135\ndifferent things that I can turn on and\noff, right.\n\n48\n00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:00,845\nMaybe for\n\n49\n00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:04,555\nthe language I don't want it set to auto\nI want to set it to American English.\n\n50\n00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:07,185\nAnd for the interface style I\nwant it to be the dark interface\n\n51\n00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:08,805\nnot the bright interface.\n\n52\n00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:12,175\nMaybe down here, I don't want to\nautomatically check for updates so\n\n53\n00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:12,765\nI'll turn that off, all right.\n\n54\n00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:18,530\nWhen I save all that and\nI get out of VLC, and\n\n55\n00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,020\nI go back into VLC,\nit's gonna remember all of those options.\n\n56\n00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,760\nIt's gonna remember them because it\nsaved them into a preferences file.\n\n57\n00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,750\nAnd so all those settings remain\nset exactly the way that I want it.\n\n58\n00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,380\nNow, where did that preferences file go?\n\n59\n00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,730\nIt could have gone into the global\npreferences folder, but\n\n60\n00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,640\nthe odds are it went into my\npersonal preferences folder.\n\n61\n00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,800\nLet's go see that.\n\n62\n00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,429\nIf I drop into my terminal,\nif I want to go to the global folder,\n\n63\n00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:45,700\nthat's in /library/preferences.\n\n64\n00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,581\nSo I'm just gonna change\ninto that directory, and\n\n65\n00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:52,928\nlet me see if I can find\nany VLC files in here.\n\n66\n00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:58,370\nRemember you might not and yeah,\nsure enough it doesn't seem like I do.\n\n67\n00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,440\nI guess it could be under\nthe company name in videolan.\n\n68\n00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,730\nNope, all right, so\nI don't have a global preference file and\n\n69\n00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,360\nI'm not terribly surprised.\n\n70\n00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,065\nA lot of applications forgo that one\nbecause you can just have individual ones\n\n71\n00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:10,810\nfor each user.\n\n72\n00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,568\nSo I need to look into my user profile, so\n\n73\n00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:20,544\nI'll switch into /users/dpezet/\nLibrary/Preferences,\n\n74\n00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:25,317\nwhich I'm going to have\na hard time spelling here.\n\n75\n00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:28,830\nSo, Preferences,\nactually that's not right either.\n\n76\n00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,310\nThere we go, Preferences,\nI will spell it right sooner or later.\n\n77\n00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,900\nOnce I'm in that folder, I can look and\n\n78\n00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,210\nI'm sure that I've got\ntons of preferences.\n\n79\n00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,910\nAll the different programs that I've run\nover the years, all laid out in here.\n\n80\n00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,830\nThere could be a lot of information,\nall right,\n\n81\n00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,910\nincluding applications you've uninstalled.\n\n82\n00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,880\nWhen you uninstall an application,\nwhen you drag and\n\n83\n00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,870\ndrop it in the trash, it will typically\nleave its preferences behind.\n\n84\n00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,840\nSo that if you go and\nrun the application again later,\n\n85\n00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,680\nif you install it, it'll remember\nall the settings from before.\n\n86\n00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,720\nThese files are all really small,\nyou know, 118 bytes,\n\n87\n00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,990\n645 bytes, that's not even 1 kilobyte.\n\n88\n00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,690\nSome of them are bigger this one is\n13 kilobytes for Parallels Desktop.\n\n89\n00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,750\nParallels Desktop is\na pretty hefty program,\n\n90\n00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,550\nthere's a lot of options and\nsettings there.\n\n91\n00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,762\nSome of them can be a little bit larger,\nbut\n\n92\n00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:15,040\neven the large ones\nare still really small.\n\n93\n00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,420\n27 kilobytes, that's a drop in the bucket\ncompared to your hard drive space.\n\n94\n00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:25,240\nAll right but down on the bottom, I can\nsee where I've got a whole folder for\n\n95\n00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,350\nVideoLAN right there, but I'll see\nthis guy is the one I'm looking for\n\n96\n00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,000\nright here, org.videolan.vlc.plist.\n\n97\n00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000\nThat's the preferences list for\nthat program.\n\n98\n00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,930\nAnd if I wanna read it, well,\nit's a little bit challenging.\n\n99\n00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,500\nBecause it's stored in a binary format.\n\n100\n00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,070\nIf I use the more command to try and view\nit, so like if I try and pull that up.\n\n101\n00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:51,953\nLet me just type in that full name.\n\n102\n00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:56,956\nSo I'm just typing\nmore./org.videolan.vlc.plist.\n\n103\n00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,040\nIt's gonna give me a warning.\n\n104\n00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,750\nIt says it may be a binary file,\nshould I see it anyway?\n\n105\n00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,550\nSure, why not, show it to me.\n\n106\n00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,490\nHere it is.\n\n107\n00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,560\nAnd when I look at it, there's some\nwords I can make out, but most of it is\n\n108\n00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,850\ncomprised of this garbage, right,\nthis junk text that's just dumped in here.\n\n109\n00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,840\nAnd I'm not actually able to\ninterpret what that means, okay.\n\n110\n00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,960\nSo what I need to do is\nI need to convert this.\n\n111\n00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,230\nAt the end of the day a p-list file is\nactually an XML file, it's human readable.\n\n112\n00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,390\nBut it's compiled into a binary format so\nit runs more securely and quickly.\n\n113\n00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,780\nWe just need to decompile it,\nand we can do that.\n\n114\n00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,880\nWell we've got a command line utility for\nthat, the plutil, right,\n\n115\n00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,580\nthe p-list utility, and\nit allows us to convert these files.\n\n116\n00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,510\nI can say, plutil-convert, and\n\n117\n00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,380\nthen specify the format I\nwant it converted into.\n\n118\n00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,430\nThere's really only two formats.\n\n119\n00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,600\nThere's XML1 and Binary1.\n\n120\n00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,770\nAnd that one is a reference to\nthe version of the p-list format.\n\n121\n00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,315\nApple only has one version,\nor at least one I know of.\n\n122\n00:06:57,315 --> 00:07:00,405\nSo I'm converting it to\nthe p-list XML version 1 format.\n\n123\n00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:04,385\nAnd then I need to specify\nthe file name that I'm converting.\n\n124\n00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:08,966\nWhich mine was org.videolan.vlc.plist.\n\n125\n00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:13,786\nSo I'll just punch that in there, let\nme make my screen a little bit wider so\n\n126\n00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:15,635\nit doesn't word wrap on us.\n\n127\n00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,680\nAnd it's gonna convert it.\n\n128\n00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,940\nNow the file name doesn't change,\nbut it is an XML file now.\n\n129\n00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,350\nThe program won't be able to work\nquite right while it's an XML file.\n\n130\n00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,785\nI can do this, make my changes or\nlook at the data and when I'm done\n\n131\n00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,805\nI can recompile it back again and\nthen it'll be available for the program.\n\n132\n00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:40,565\nSo if I take a look at it now, if I run\nthat same more command from before,\n\n133\n00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:43,437\ninstead of warning me about being\na binary It'll show me the data.\n\n134\n00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:46,557\nAnd it's just an XML file,\nit's not very hard to read.\n\n135\n00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:47,710\nAnd you can look in here and\n\n136\n00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,181\nsee the settings like what\nfolders it shows by default.\n\n137\n00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:52,165\nThe window location on the screen so\n\n138\n00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:55,352\nit can launch back into the same\nplace that it was before.\n\n139\n00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:59,281\nAs I continue to look down,\nyou'll spot other things in here\n\n140\n00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:02,758\nlike Enable automatic update\nchecks is set to false.\n\n141\n00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:03,288\nAll right?\nSo\n\n142\n00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:06,330\nit's remembering don't do\nthose automatic update checks.\n\n143\n00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,290\nAnd if I were to launch VLC Player\nit would show that, right?\n\n144\n00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,960\nI turned that off before.\n\n145\n00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,690\nBut it is just an XML file.\n\n146\n00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,540\nI could go and edit that and\nchange it to true.\n\n147\n00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,050\nAnd so then it would say enable\nautomatic update checks True.\n\n148\n00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,410\nAnd that would be turned on.\n\n149\n00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,450\nJust storing it right here inside of this.\n\n150\n00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,510\nYou'll see the language.\n\n151\n00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,700\nI hard set the language to English.\n\n152\n00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,030\nI also set the screen to show\nthe dark view instead of light.\n\n153\n00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,080\nI don't know where in here that's stored.\n\n154\n00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,530\nWhoever writes the application can pick\nwhatever name they want for these options.\n\n155\n00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,380\nSo sometimes it's really\neasy to spot language.\n\n156\n00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,700\nEN for English.\n\n157\n00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,920\nDone, right?\n\n158\n00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,260\nOther times it can be a little bit more\ndifficult, this, the theme that I chose,\n\n159\n00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,490\nthat could be called any number of things.\n\n160\n00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,490\nSo I'd have to look through here and\n\n161\n00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,400\nsee if I couldn't figure out which one\nof these actually referred to the theme.\n\n162\n00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,890\nBut, either way,\nit's all stored right here.\n\n163\n00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,634\nI can poke around in there and\nchange things if I want, when I'm done,\n\n164\n00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:06,193\nI just need to make sure that I\nconvert it back to the binary format.\n\n165\n00:09:06,193 --> 00:09:09,420\nSo that's the PLUTIL-convert.\n\n166\n00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,190\nBinary 1 and then the name of\nthe file to convert it back, and\n\n167\n00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,360\nnow you can go back in your\napplication and use it.\n\n168\n00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,770\nSo P list files, every program creates\nthem, they might be a binary, but\n\n169\n00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,320\nyou can use PLUTIL to decode or\ndecompile them, edit them, look at them,\n\n170\n00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,710\ndo whatever you need, and\nthen recompile them again, right?\n\n171\n00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,370\nPretty straightforward.\n\n172\n00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,560\nAll right now,\nthe preference file that's one\n\n173\n00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,540\nthing that gets generated\nby an application.\n\n174\n00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,720\nAnother thing that gets generated by\nthe application is application data.\n\n175\n00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,390\nAll right?\n\n176\n00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,460\nIf you've got a word processor\nthen you're creating documents and\n\n177\n00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,550\nthey got to get saved somewhere.\n\n178\n00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,340\nIf you've got photo management or\nphoto editing software,\n\n179\n00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,510\nyou're creating images and\nthey get saved somewhere, right.\n\n180\n00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,470\nThat's your data that's coming\nout of that application.\n\n181\n00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,510\nAnd that stuffs pretty important.\n\n182\n00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,210\nWell, there's some neat things\nwe can do with that data too.\n\n183\n00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,390\nRight?\n\n184\n00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,350\nOne of the things that I wanna show\nyou guys is the locked flag for data.\n\n185\n00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,960\nIf I go to my desktop,\nlet me just get out of some of this stuff.\n\n186\n00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,230\nOn my desktop I've got a little\ntext file here, called HQ.text.\n\n187\n00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,070\nInside it's got a router\nconfiguration that I wrote.\n\n188\n00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,270\nAnd, if I pull that up\ninto a text program,\n\n189\n00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,740\nI can see the router configuration.\n\n190\n00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,600\nSo, here it is.\n\n191\n00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,890\nThis is the configuration.\n\n192\n00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,850\nIt's all here, it's just straight up text.\n\n193\n00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,720\nAll right?\n\n194\n00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,910\nI can edit that and\nchange it and do whatever I want.\n\n195\n00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,560\nRight?\nSo, I'll go ahead and make a change,\n\n196\n00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,360\nI'll just bump up that version to 12.4 and\nI'll save it, and I'll get out, all right.\n\n197\n00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,660\nSo I just modified that file,\nthat's behavior that we expect, right?\n\n198\n00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,850\nBut what if I want to prevent\naccidental changes to the file?\n\n199\n00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,360\nWhen I open it I'm opening it\ninto a little word processor.\n\n200\n00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,710\nAnd the word processor, it'll let me\nchange, and if I click somewhere and\n\n201\n00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:52,280\ntype by accident and forget about it, it\nrecognizes that and it lets me type it in.\n\n202\n00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,045\nBut, if I don't realize I did it,\nand I just quit.\n\n203\n00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:57,605\nMy little word processor\nautomatically saves.\n\n204\n00:10:57,605 --> 00:11:01,545\nSo, now, I accidentally typed data in\nthere, didn't realize I did it and\n\n205\n00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:04,955\nwhen I opened it again,\nit's gonna remember that bad data.\n\n206\n00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,605\nIt's right there, and\nI didn't necessarily know that.\n\n207\n00:11:07,605 --> 00:11:11,345\nSo, if we're worried about accidental\nchanges to our documents like this,\n\n208\n00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,520\nhow can we prevent that?\n\n209\n00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,160\nWell, we could remove our right\npermissions to the file, but\n\n210\n00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,140\nthat's kind of annoying cuz then we\ncan't write to it when we want to.\n\n211\n00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,910\nSo a better option is\ninstead to lock the file.\n\n212\n00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,730\nWe can lock it and\nthat effectively makes it read only,\n\n213\n00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,080\nand it's very easy to turn the lock on and\noff.\n\n214\n00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,030\nThis is something your average end\nuser can easily understand, all right.\n\n215\n00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,530\nSo let me show you an example here.\n\n216\n00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,468\nSo if I take this HQ file, and I wanna\nlock it, all I have to do is, I can do\n\n217\n00:11:39,468 --> 00:11:45,610\ncommand-i, or CTRL+Click and get info\nto get to it's info screen, either way.\n\n218\n00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,850\nOnce I'm there you got this\nlittle lock button you can check.\n\n219\n00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,880\nAnd when you check it you'll see\na lock icon appear on that file and\n\n220\n00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,770\nit's now locked.\n\n221\n00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,790\nIt's now read only.\n\n222\n00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,930\nWatch what happens down here where\nit says you can read and write.\n\n223\n00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,370\nI can read and write on this file.\n\n224\n00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,290\nIf I check that lock button.\n\n225\n00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,330\nNow it says you can only read.\n\n226\n00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,980\nIt just made it read only.\n\n227\n00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,960\nIf I look at the permissions,\nit still says D Pezet has read and write.\n\n228\n00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,120\nI have full access to that file.\n\n229\n00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,360\nBut, I can only read it right\nnow because it's locked.\n\n230\n00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,790\nAnd if I open that file up.\n\n231\n00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,680\nAnd I accidentally type something in.\n\n232\n00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,380\nWhen I go to quit or save that, right?\n\n233\n00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,190\nIt tried to save it.\n\n234\n00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,390\nBut what happened?\n\n235\n00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,260\nWell, I open it again I'll see it\ntried to save it, but it failed.\n\n236\n00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,170\nThat extra stuff that I put in there.\n\n237\n00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,130\nIf I had actually used the save function,\nI would've seen the message here,\n\n238\n00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,570\nunable to Sync or permission denied,\nor write access prevented,\n\n239\n00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,220\nsome kind of warning message\nthat the developer puts in.\n\n240\n00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,400\nBut I can see that I wasn't\nable to save it, right?\n\n241\n00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,140\nAnd that's exactly what I want,\nyou can quickly lock and unlock files.\n\n242\n00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,260\nSo, If I want to make a change,\nall I've got to do is go into the file.\n\n243\n00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,410\nUnlock it.\n\n244\n00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,790\nMake the change and then lock it again.\n\n245\n00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,210\nVery easy to move around with,\nso kind of a convenient thing.\n\n246\n00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,670\nYou can do it from the command line too.\n\n247\n00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,630\nThat lock attribute, that's actually\na file flag that's being set.\n\n248\n00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,710\nAnd it's just turning the flag on and off.\n\n249\n00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,730\nAnd it's pretty easy to manipulate that.\n\n250\n00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,250\nThere's a command utility called Change\nFlags, and we can call that to modify it.\n\n251\n00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,440\nThe only weird part is\nthe name of the flag.\n\n252\n00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,020\nSo, if I change into my desktop.\n\n253\n00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:31,190\nHere's that HQ.txt.\n\n254\n00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,220\nAnd let me move it up here.\n\n255\n00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,840\nSo I can see as of right now, it's locked.\n\n256\n00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,100\nIt's got the little lock icon and\nI can see it's locked over here.\n\n257\n00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:47,200\nFrom the terminal, I can run CH flags,\nUCH, actually I wanna do\n\n258\n00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,410\nnoUCHG, no UCHD is going to unlock it.\n\n259\n00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,760\nUCHD is user changed, and I wanna make\nsure that this one can't be changed.\n\n260\n00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,300\nWell that when you lock it.\n\n261\n00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,030\nSo you set the UCHG flag to lock it.\n\n262\n00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,560\nIt's already set for me.\n\n263\n00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,040\nI need to remove it, so\nI'm going to say no UCHG and\n\n264\n00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,800\nthen the name of the file which is Hq.txt,\nnotice the lock\n\n265\n00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,760\njust disappeared from the file, and the\ncheckmark went away over here in getinfo.\n\n266\n00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,790\nIf I want to relock it,\nI just remove the word no.\n\n267\n00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,950\nSo, it's CHflags UCHG, and\nthen the name of the file.\n\n268\n00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,210\nAnd I can run it,\nI've got a little lock there.\n\n269\n00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,920\nAnd it's checked off right there.\n\n270\n00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,090\nIt's now locked in in place.\n\n271\n00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,620\nSo easy to toggle that from\nthe command line using CH files.\n\n272\n00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,310\nIf you've been watching all of our\nepisodes you probably remember when we did\n\n273\n00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,500\nhidden files.\n\n274\n00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,300\nAnd we could hide the file or make it\nappear, and that was with CH flags also.\n\n275\n00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,220\nWe just did CH flags,\nhidden, to hide it, and\n\n276\n00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,520\nsee how it just disappeared\nfrom my desktop.\n\n277\n00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:58,470\nOr, if I do no hidden, that one will\nreappear, and there it is again.\n\n278\n00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,710\nThe same thing, right?\n\n279\n00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,600\nMaking it read only, making it hidden,\njust changing that flag.\n\n280\n00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,830\nThe only difference is,\nthe locked one actually has a GUIL on it.\n\n281\n00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,090\nIt's easy to toggle right here,\nthe hidden flag,\n\n282\n00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,210\nyou got to do that from the terminal.\n\n283\n00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,480\nAll right.\n\n284\n00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,170\nSo, those are a couple of\ndifferent things that we can\n\n285\n00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,410\nset to be able to manipulate that file.\n\n286\n00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,275\nAnother thing worth mentioning\nis that's a Text file.\n\n287\n00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:25,285\nWhen I double clicked on it,\n\n288\n00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:29,145\nit opened up in my little word\nprocessor a program called Write.\n\n289\n00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:30,815\nYou may or may not have that application.\n\n290\n00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,825\nI don't think it's very popular so\nyou probably don't have it.\n\n291\n00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:37,165\nSo, when I double click it,\nit goes into Write.\n\n292\n00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:40,985\nWhen you double click it,\nit might go into a different program.\n\n293\n00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:44,300\nOn a default Yosemite install\nwe're actually going to text edit.\n\n294\n00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,469\nAll right, so\nyou might see it go into text edit, or\n\n295\n00:15:46,469 --> 00:15:49,508\nyou might have TextWrangler or\nsomething else that it goes to, right?\n\n296\n00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:53,764\nHow does your Mac know which\nprogram to use to launch it?\n\n297\n00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:57,466\nAll right?\nWell we can actually see that right here\n\n298\n00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:58,545\nin get info.\n\n299\n00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:02,751\nWhen I pull the get info for this file,\nit's got right here Open With.\n\n300\n00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:05,230\nAnd it's saying that it's\ngoing to open it with write.\n\n301\n00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,920\nWrite is the default for\nthis particular file type right now.\n\n302\n00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,660\nAlright?\n\n303\n00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,810\nI can override that by dropping down\nthe list and picking other programs.\n\n304\n00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,050\nWhen you install a program, the program\nadds what are called launch services.\n\n305\n00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,680\nLaunch services are just a list of\nfiles that, that program supports.\n\n306\n00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,210\nSo it basically tells\nthe operating system hey,\n\n307\n00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,350\nthese are some of\nthe files that I can open.\n\n308\n00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,860\nAnd that's what's in this list,\nthis open with list.\n\n309\n00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,620\nYou'll see the open with\nlist if you control click,\n\n310\n00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,170\nor right click on a file,\nyou can go to open with and\n\n311\n00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,630\nyou'll see all the programs that\nare registered to that extension.\n\n312\n00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,270\nIt is based on the extension.\n\n313\n00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,610\nI'm looking at a text file.\n\n314\n00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,950\nI've got all sorts of programs\nthat can open up a text file.\n\n315\n00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,190\nIf I were to take something a little\nbit different like a zip file and\n\n316\n00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,730\nright click on it,\nI don't have a lot of programs for that.\n\n317\n00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,760\nI've got the Archive Utility\nthat's included with Mac OS, and\n\n318\n00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,740\nI've got the Entropy Utility\nthat I installed later on.\n\n319\n00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,730\nThose are my only choices, right.\n\n320\n00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,570\nOr I can go to the app store, and\n\n321\n00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,290\nit will show me apps in the app store\nthat are registered to handle this.\n\n322\n00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,680\nThat's a pretty neat feature.\n\n323\n00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,155\nIf I click on that, it's gonna take me to\nthe app store, and look at this search.\n\n324\n00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:13,930\nThird string up here.\n\n325\n00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,125\nUtil:public.zip/archive.\n\n326\n00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:21,385\nIt's looking for\nfiles that can handle a zip file, and\n\n327\n00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:23,525\nthat's all that I'm gonna see,\napplication wise.\n\n328\n00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,180\nThis is all the programs\nthat can work with that.\n\n329\n00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,280\nThen you'd be surprised,\nsome of the ones that are out there.\n\n330\n00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,699\nIt's a great way to find\nan application to open a document.\n\n331\n00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:37,364\nNow when it creates those launch services,\nif you wanna know the back end of this,\n\n332\n00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:39,380\nit is actually just writing a little file.\n\n333\n00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,030\nLet me show you where these go.\n\n334\n00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,794\nIt's a preference file that it writes\ninside of /Library/Preferences.\n\n335\n00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,580\nThere is a preference.\n\n336\n00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,868\nLet's see if we can find it here.\n\n337\n00:17:57,403 --> 00:17:58,210\nOh, let's see.\n\n338\n00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,840\nIt should exist.\n\n339\n00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,900\nIt's an Apple one.\n\n340\n00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,630\nLet's see if I've got it here.\n\n341\n00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:10,780\nIt should be com.apple.launchservices.\n\n342\n00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,042\nAnd I'm not seeing it.\n\n343\n00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:16,900\nI'm sure I haven't overridden it.\n\n344\n00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,100\nLet me make sure I'm\nlooking in the right place.\n\n345\n00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,960\nLet's see.\n\n346\n00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:24,680\nAll right, well, you've got it for\nthe system as well as you personally.\n\n347\n00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,460\nOn the system,\n\n348\n00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,970\nyou'll see com.apple.launchservices\nis what it's called.\n\n349\n00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,110\nAnd it's a PLIST file that lists\nall of the file extensions and\n\n350\n00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,540\nwhat programs are tied to them.\n\n351\n00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,150\nAnd you track it personally too,\nlike for your individual account.\n\n352\n00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:44,210\nIf I change into my\n/Users/dpezet/Library/ Preferences.\n\n353\n00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,450\nWe'll look in here and\nI'll go to the Apple section, com.apple,\n\n354\n00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,995\nand we'll see if I can find the launch\nservices for me specifically.\n\n355\n00:18:53,995 --> 00:18:57,060\nI got a couple of Apple things in here,\ndon't I?\n\n356\n00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,150\nIt will turn up.\n\n357\n00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,495\nThere we go!\nRight there.\n\n358\n00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:04,330\nCom.apple.launchservices.plist, it's\na preference list, and it\n\n359\n00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,860\ncontains entries for the file extensions\nand what programs are attached to them.\n\n360\n00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,260\nSo when I install a new program, it'll\nregister itself with that Launch Services.\n\n361\n00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,220\nAnd that way,\nMac OS knows what program to use.\n\n362\n00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,410\nIf I wanna override it, it can be\noverridden on a per file basis or\n\n363\n00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,870\nall across the board.\n\n364\n00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:27,170\nSo for example I've got these router\nconfigs, and they're all text files.\n\n365\n00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:33,790\nWell for branch 1, if I take the BR1.txt,\nand I pull up it's information.\n\n366\n00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,820\nAnd I go to open width,\nI can choose a different text editor.\n\n367\n00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,590\nSo maybe I want to open\nthis one with text edit.\n\n368\n00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,010\nJust a built in.\n\n369\n00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:41,890\nMac TextEdit.\n\n370\n00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,240\nI can set that and if I open branch one\nit's going to try to open it in TextEdit.\n\n371\n00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,660\nIt's warning me that it's from and\nunidentified developer.\n\n372\n00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,910\nI copied it from a network share,\nso it's griping at me.\n\n373\n00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,400\nThat's Gatekeeper kicking\nin its quarantine.\n\n374\n00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,850\nSo, I'll just do the right-click and\nopen to bypass that.\n\n375\n00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,890\nAnd there it goes and\nit opened in Text Edit.\n\n376\n00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,600\nNow I'm in the Text Edit utility.\n\n377\n00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,020\nIf I open my next one br2,\nit's going to open up in Write.\n\n378\n00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,190\nSee how it's got different default\nprograms now for each file,\n\n379\n00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,650\nyou can overwrite it on a per file basis\nand it's storing it in the file meta data.\n\n380\n00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,500\nIf I want to overwrite it for\nevery text file though.\n\n381\n00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,490\nIf I want every single text file on my\ncomputer to open up in Text Edit or\n\n382\n00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,140\nsome other application.\n\n383\n00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:31,340\nWhen you do that get info, and you change\nthe default application to something else.\n\n384\n00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,960\nAll right so\nmaybe I'll change them to Sublime Text.\n\n385\n00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,130\nYou've got this button\nright here to change all.\n\n386\n00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,910\nAnd when you hit change all\nit is going to change it so\n\n387\n00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:44,020\nthat all text documents from now\non will open up with Sublime Text.\n\n388\n00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,120\nAnd so if I go back and open up BR1.text,\nwhat opened in Text Edit a moment ago.\n\n389\n00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,790\nWhen I open it now, oh shoot.\n\n390\n00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,480\nIt's overridden on that particular file.\n\n391\n00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,570\nBut if I take these other guys where\nI haven't specifically overridden it,\n\n392\n00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,540\nit's gonna go in a sublime text.\n\n393\n00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,790\nI forgot about that.\n\n394\n00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,640\nIf you override something on\na particular file, that stays.\n\n395\n00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,340\nEven when you do the change all.\n\n396\n00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:04,840\nRight.\n\n397\n00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,410\nChange all is basically affecting\nall of the files that you\n\n398\n00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,210\nhaven't manually overridden.\n\n399\n00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,690\nIf you manually overrode one,\nthough, it does remember that.\n\n400\n00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,070\nAnd so it's going to open it up\nthat way until you reboot and\n\n401\n00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,090\nthen it'll reset that.\n\n402\n00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,090\nBut if I take branch one and\njust pull up it's information,\n\n403\n00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,890\nsee how it's still set to text\nedit cuz of that manual override.\n\n404\n00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,790\nAnd I can just change that one to\nSublime or whatever it is that I want.\n\n405\n00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,790\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n406\n00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,500\nswitch it back to Right,\ncuz that's my preferred application.\n\n407\n00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,050\nAnd I'll hit change all there.\n\n408\n00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,060\nAnd now that'll take care of that.\n\n409\n00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,950\nAll right.\n\n410\n00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,590\nSo now I can go in and\nI can fire those up and\n\n411\n00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,320\nI'll launch into my preferred application.\n\n412\n00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,360\nSo just another little\nthing that we might need\n\n413\n00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,360\nto tweak as we work with the applications\nto kind of change that stuff.\n\n414\n00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,190\nIt can be overridden several ways.\n\n415\n00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,950\nIf it's just a one time override,\n\n416\n00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,658\nif you just wanna open it one\ntime in a different application,\n\n417\n00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:57,770\nyou can right-click and go to Open With\nand pick the application from there.\n\n418\n00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,750\nSo just this one time I wanna\nopen it up in Pages, and so\n\n419\n00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,380\nI'll click that and\nit's gonna fire up Pages.\n\n420\n00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,900\nAnd open that up and there we go.\n\n421\n00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,360\nNow I can see it and\nwork with it right in here.\n\n422\n00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,392\nBut the next time that I open it,\nit's not gonna open in Pages,\n\n423\n00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:15,500\nit's gonna open up in the application\nthat I have as my default.\n\n424\n00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,500\nAll right, well, those are a couple\nof examples of working with the data\n\n425\n00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,280\nthat our applications generate.\n\n426\n00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,500\nWe've got some other stuff that I want\nto tackle in this episode in particular.\n\n427\n00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,220\nI want to get into Quicklook,\nsome of the preview functionality, and\n\n428\n00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,260\nsome other things that programs\ndo when they get installed.\n\n429\n00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,252\nSo, stay tuned for that, but for\nright now, we're going to pause and\n\n430\n00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,193\ntake a break, and\nwe'll be back after this.\n\n431\n00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:42,746\n[MUSIC]\n\n432\n00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:44,620\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n433\n00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,350\nSo at this point we talked about\nthe data the application generates,\n\n434\n00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,830\nthe preferences the application generates.\n\n435\n00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,500\nThere's one more thing I want to mention\nthat an application can install when\n\n436\n00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,110\nit's added in.\n\n437\n00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,960\nSo you might have noticed at various\n\n438\n00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,380\npoints inside of\nthe Mac OS user interface,\n\n439\n00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:08,110\nyou get kind of a preview of the content\nof a file without even opening it.\n\n440\n00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,640\nAll right.\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n441\n00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,080\nSo for example, if I browse into\nthis folder here on my desktop,\n\n442\n00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,170\nI see these text files.\n\n443\n00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,160\nThere's nothing too\nspectacular about that, right?\n\n444\n00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,280\nBut if I go up to my View menu here,\nI can choose View>Show Preview.\n\n445\n00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,260\nAnd a little box is gonna appear\nover here on the side of my screen.\n\n446\n00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,450\nAnd as I click on files.\n\n447\n00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,893\nIt'll give me a preview of\nwhat's inside of that file.\n\n448\n00:23:29,893 --> 00:23:33,130\nNow, this is just a text file so\nit's actually showing me some of that\n\n449\n00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:37,860\ntext right there and\nI can see it without actually opening it.\n\n450\n00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,790\nEven without displaying that pane, if I\nturn that off, I hide the preview pane.\n\n451\n00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,220\nI can select any file and\nI can just press space bar on my keyboard.\n\n452\n00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,757\nAnd when you press space bar it brings up\nthat preview without actually opening it.\n\n453\n00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:54,016\nSee, I can't edit that,\n[LAUGH] I can try and edit it,\n\n454\n00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,127\nI can't edit that in this screen.\n\n455\n00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:58,464\nI just see the data and that's it.\n\n456\n00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:02,426\nAll right, this is a feature\nof Mac OS called Quick Look.\n\n457\n00:24:02,426 --> 00:24:04,797\nQuick Look is what's actually\ngenerating those previews or\n\n458\n00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:07,420\ngenerating this screen that\nI'm looking at right now.\n\n459\n00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,910\nSee how it's not a separate program, it\nstill says Finder up her in my menu bar.\n\n460\n00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,960\nBecause I'm still in the Finder, this is\nthe Quick Look function of the Finder.\n\n461\n00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,550\nNow if I have other applications or\ndocuments or\n\n462\n00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,660\nwhatever, let me see if I have a,\nI don't know.\n\n463\n00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,190\nI gotta have something else lying around\nhere like an image or he's a PDF file.\n\n464\n00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,190\nAll right.\n\n465\n00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,250\nIf I were to hit Space on that,\nhere it is.\n\n466\n00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,430\nI can see that PDF is being\nrendered inside of the Finder.\n\n467\n00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,640\nNot being rendered\ninside of Adobe Acrobat,\n\n468\n00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,550\nwhich I do have on this system,\nbut it's rendering it via Finder.\n\n469\n00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,270\nOkay?\nNow how does it do that?\n\n470\n00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,700\nWell, Quick Look has a number of plugins.\n\n471\n00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,540\nAnd those plugins let it see these\napplications and render them.\n\n472\n00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,070\nBut it's only got plugins for\nso many things.\n\n473\n00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:54,640\nYou install third party applications,\nthey might have proprietary data types.\n\n474\n00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,480\nAnd if you have a proprietary data type,\nhow's it gonna display that data?\n\n475\n00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,810\nIt can't.\n\n476\n00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,610\nBut when you install your application,\n\n477\n00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:08,580\nyour application might also\ninstall some quick look plugins.\n\n478\n00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,460\nThat way,\nthe Finder can render those documents.\n\n479\n00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,150\nSo you wanna be aware of that.\n\n480\n00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,790\nNow, how do you know if something\ninstalled a quick look plugin for\n\n481\n00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,760\nyour system?\n\n482\n00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,050\nWell, it tucks them\naway on our hard drive.\n\n483\n00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,780\nWe can actually kind of browse it and\n\n484\n00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,450\nfind them, there buried away\ninside of our library folders.\n\n485\n00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,545\nSo if I fire up my finder again and\nI'm just gonna browse to.\n\n486\n00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:34,246\nLet's go to /library, inside of /library,\n\n487\n00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:39,980\nyou'll see a folder in\nthere called Quick Look.\n\n488\n00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,280\nThere it is right there.\n\n489\n00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,710\nAnd inside of quick look,\nyou'll see all the different\n\n490\n00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,200\nquick look plugins that have been\ninstalled for the system globally.\n\n491\n00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,300\nYou can also have quick look\nplugins just for you as the user.\n\n492\n00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,880\nAnd there's ones that come\nwith the operating system.\n\n493\n00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,430\nNow if you look at mine,\nI've only got two.\n\n494\n00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:01,800\nI got an iBooks Author generator and\nan iWork generator, all right?\n\n495\n00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,220\nThose didn't come with my\noperating system, Yosemite,\n\n496\n00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,360\nI installed the iBooks Author and I\ninstalled iWork on my system later on, and\n\n497\n00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,070\nadded those quick look generators for\nthem.\n\n498\n00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,710\nSo it would be able to render previews\nof documents made in those applications.\n\n499\n00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,650\nNow, those are the ones globally.\n\n500\n00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,560\nThere might be ones for me specifically.\n\n501\n00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,170\nI don't think I've installed any for\nmyself.\n\n502\n00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,670\nLet's see.\n\n503\n00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:29,540\nSo if I go to my own library,\nand go into Quick Look.\n\n504\n00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,910\nI might not even have a folder.\n\n505\n00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,310\nIf you haven't even installed\na single Quick Look item,\n\n506\n00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,850\nthe folder might not exist and\nyou can see for me it doesn't.\n\n507\n00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,120\nSo I don't even have\na folder in my own profile.\n\n508\n00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,010\nBut there is a system library and\n\n509\n00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:46,040\nthat one's gonna have quite a few\nof these Quicklook plugins also.\n\n510\n00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,668\nSo if I browse into /System/Library,\nwhich I'm trying to type.\n\n511\n00:26:51,668 --> 00:26:56,087\nThere we go, if I browse into that,\nand I look at Quick Look in here,\n\n512\n00:26:56,087 --> 00:26:58,790\nI should see quite a few entries.\n\n513\n00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,330\nThese are the ones that come\nwith the operating system,\n\n514\n00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,710\nthese are the ones that Apple made.\n\n515\n00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,380\nAnd Apple's made a bunch\nof them like Audio.\n\n516\n00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,850\nAudio will give you a preview of MP3s,\nand AACs, and files like that.\n\n517\n00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,290\nNow, what do I mean by preview?\n\n518\n00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,500\nWell it's not a view like a visual view,\n\n519\n00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,360\nit actually gives you the chance to\nhit play and listen to that sound.\n\n520\n00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,330\nYou can actually play that file.\n\n521\n00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:22,550\nYou got things like contacts, EPS,\nthat's raw printer documents.\n\n522\n00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,740\nYou got iChat histories, images.\n\n523\n00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,620\nThat'll do GIF, PNG, JPG, all those guys.\n\n524\n00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,570\nMovies, mail, office applications.\n\n525\n00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,100\nSo they've got a bunch of them,\nand here's the PDF generator\n\n526\n00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,170\nthat was generating that PDF\npreview we saw a moment ago.\n\n527\n00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,930\nThese are the quicklook add ons.\n\n528\n00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,510\nThese Quick Look plugins.\n\n529\n00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:45,600\nSo when you install a third party\napplication, it's not uncommon for\n\n530\n00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,570\nthem to bring a Quick Look\nplugin along with them, also.\n\n531\n00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,150\nAnd that's what's enabling\nthat preview functionality.\n\n532\n00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,340\nIf you ever wondered how that preview\ngenerated, that's it right there.\n\n533\n00:27:55,682 --> 00:27:58,160\nAll right, and there's plenty of third\nparty plugins like these available out\n\n534\n00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,460\nthere on the internet that can\npreview all sorts of things,\n\n535\n00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,680\nincluding like archives and other data.\n\n536\n00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,640\nSo, if you want that,\nyou can reach out and\n\n537\n00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,360\nkind of find them out\nthere on the internet.\n\n538\n00:28:08,142 --> 00:28:10,840\nAll right, so,\nthose are the quick look plugins.\n\n539\n00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,350\nThe other thing that I want to\ntackle before we wrap this show up.\n\n540\n00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,660\nIs a neat little feature that was\nintroduced a few versions ago but\n\n541\n00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,600\nit's kind of important in\nYosemite called autosave.\n\n542\n00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,520\nAutosave is another neat thing\nthat is a part of the OS but\n\n543\n00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,300\nthird party applications\ncan interact with.\n\n544\n00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,670\nAll right, if you think about it let's\nsay you're working on your laptop and you\n\n545\n00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,340\nopen document and you start editing it and\nyou do a bunch of work in that document.\n\n546\n00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,760\nBut you never save it.\n\n547\n00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,620\nAll right?\n\n548\n00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,300\nAnd then all of a sudden you\nclose the application, or\n\n549\n00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,190\nyou reboot your laptop, and\nyou forgot to save that document.\n\n550\n00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,850\nWell what happens to your data?\n\n551\n00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,050\nIt's gone.\n\n552\n00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,060\nWell there's a lot of applications,\nlike word processors,\n\n553\n00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,160\nthat will implement an auto save feature.\n\n554\n00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,370\nWhere while you're working on it,\nit'll just save it every now and then.\n\n555\n00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,010\nOkay.\n\n556\n00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,880\nThere's some vendors that\ndon't like to do that though.\n\n557\n00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,550\nThey don't want their software\nto automatically save because\n\n558\n00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,820\nwhat if you didn't intend to save.\n\n559\n00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,620\nWhat if you just a made quick\nchange to see what happens and\n\n560\n00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,830\nyou're planning on undoing it and\ngoing back.\n\n561\n00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,810\nWell you don't want to save\nit with that that change.\n\n562\n00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,790\nSo some vendors make it where it's manual.\n\n563\n00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,890\nYou yourself have to go to File and\nSave or command that so\n\n564\n00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,070\nwhatever, to save when you want it.\n\n565\n00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,750\nThe problem there is you might lose data.\n\n566\n00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:24,540\nSo what Apple did is Apple said well,\nwhat if we combine this with Time Machine?\n\n567\n00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,940\nWhat if we made it where your application\ncould automatically save whenever you want\n\n568\n00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:33,590\nit and we used Time Machine to\nstore those previous versions of\n\n569\n00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:37,320\nthe file so if you didn't want to save you\ncould still roll back using Time Machine.\n\n570\n00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,670\nAnd that's how the autosave\nfeature was created in Mac OS.\n\n571\n00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:46,315\nSo now the OS can do that for us,\nautomatically saving the documents we\n\n572\n00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:50,270\nwork on regardless of whether\nwe choose to save them or not.\n\n573\n00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,370\nOkay.\n\n574\n00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,298\nNow, it was developed for\nthe operating system, but\n\n575\n00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:57,290\nApple opened it up for\nevery third party developer, so\n\n576\n00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,610\nany third part developer that\nwants to support auto save can.\n\n577\n00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,670\nUnfortunately, there's not\na great way to tell whether or\n\n578\n00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,320\nnot auto save is enabled in an application\nwithout reaching out to the vendor.\n\n579\n00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,900\nBut I will show you one little\ntrick that you can use.\n\n580\n00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,510\nWhen auto save is enabled,\n\n581\n00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,290\nit adds a few items to the menu\nthat aren't normally there.\n\n582\n00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,580\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n583\n00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,840\nIf I fire up Text Edit.\n\n584\n00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,600\nSo just the raw text editor\nthat comes with MAC OS.\n\n585\n00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,930\nSo this comes with MAC OS.\n\n586\n00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,260\nIt's written by Apple, so you know that\nthey added auto save support in here.\n\n587\n00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,260\nIf I start to write out some kind of\na document, it's gonna automatically save.\n\n588\n00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,980\nWell assuming I've saved it at least once.\n\n589\n00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,980\nI have to save it once so\nit has a file name.\n\n590\n00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,510\nAnd then after that it'll be\nable to save it on its own.\n\n591\n00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,900\nAll right.\n\n592\n00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:47,000\nIf you look under your File menu and\nyou see duplicate, rename, move to, and\n\n593\n00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000\nrevert to, those four options right there,\nthose options are provided by autosave.\n\n594\n00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,630\nSo if you see those menu items, you know\nthat vendor supports autosave, right?\n\n595\n00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:58,480\nWell, that's important for\n\n596\n00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,110\nme because I don't use the text edit\nprogram that comes inside a Mac OS.\n\n597\n00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,360\nI use a program called Write\nfrom a different company.\n\n598\n00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,660\nDoes Write support autosave?\n\n599\n00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,390\nI don't know.\nI actually honestly don't know.\n\n600\n00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,310\nI've never really looked.\n\n601\n00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:14,410\nBut, if I go into the File menu,\ndo I see Rename?\n\n602\n00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,730\nDo I see Duplicate?\n\n603\n00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,040\nRevert to?\n\n604\n00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,550\nI don't see any of those options.\n\n605\n00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,130\nAll right?\nThat means this application does not\n\n606\n00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,030\nsupport autosave.\n\n607\n00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,540\nNow, it has its own autosave\nfunctionality in it.\n\n608\n00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,080\nThe author actually wrote his own.\n\n609\n00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,720\nSo, it does do it, but It doesn't\nsupport Apple's version of auto save.\n\n610\n00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,640\nIf I take a look at some of\nmy other text editors I have\n\n611\n00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,070\na wide variety of text\neditors on my laptop.\n\n612\n00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,540\nSo here I'll take a look at Sublime Text.\n\n613\n00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,470\nIf I go under File, well, same thing here.\n\n614\n00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,070\nI don't see those options.\n\n615\n00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,356\nI've got a revert option here, but\nthat's actually part of sublime,\n\n616\n00:31:49,356 --> 00:31:50,465\nnot the one from Apple.\n\n617\n00:31:50,465 --> 00:31:54,181\nSo not every program is going to\nhave this auto save functionality\n\n618\n00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:55,676\nthat I'm talking about.\n\n619\n00:31:55,676 --> 00:31:59,547\nThey might have their own,\nwhich is what I'm seeing here.\n\n620\n00:31:59,547 --> 00:32:02,446\nWell let's say that I\ntook this hq.txt file and\n\n621\n00:32:02,446 --> 00:32:07,810\nI'm gonna open it with just the regular\nold text edit that's built in to MAC OS.\n\n622\n00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:12,188\nSo here it is, I can see my data,\nI can go in and I can start to edit it.\n\n623\n00:32:12,188 --> 00:32:13,134\nRight?\n\n624\n00:32:13,134 --> 00:32:17,400\nNotice how I see this little\nmessage up here that says edited.\n\n625\n00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,370\nThat's warning me that I've\nchanged the data somehow.\n\n626\n00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:20,910\nOkay.\n\n627\n00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,920\nI've made a modification,\nand I haven't saved yet.\n\n628\n00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,160\nNow, normally I'd need to save this,\nright?\n\n629\n00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,180\nIf I closed it, and didn't save,\nI would lose my data.\n\n630\n00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,190\nBut here, if i just go to text edit, and\nquit text edit I quit and I didn't save.\n\n631\n00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,580\nBut if I relaunch it,\nit's gonna come back up.\n\n632\n00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,970\nWhoops [LAUGH].\n\n633\n00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,720\nIf I relaunch it in TextEdit.\n\n634\n00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,510\nLet me get that right.\n\n635\n00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,280\nSo if I relaunch it in TextEdit,\nit's gonna come back.\n\n636\n00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,950\nAnd see how it says 12.3\ninstead of 12.4 now?\n\n637\n00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,240\nIt saved that change.\n\n638\n00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,780\nIt remembers that change that I made.\n\n639\n00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,415\nIt autosaved.\n\n640\n00:32:51,415 --> 00:32:52,510\nOkay?\n\n641\n00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:56,840\nSo it is saving for me so I don't lose\nthat data that I've been working on.\n\n642\n00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,020\nAnd if I decided I didn't wanna save,\nI can go up here to File > Revert to,\n\n643\n00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,305\nand you'll see revert to\nthe last opened version, so\n\n644\n00:33:04,305 --> 00:33:07,470\nthat the version that I opened when\nI actually started working with this.\n\n645\n00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:12,110\nOr I can choose Browse All Versions and\nthat's the integration with Time Machine.\n\n646\n00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,230\nIt takes me to the time machine for\nthat specific file, and I can see it.\n\n647\n00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:20,070\nSee I've got 12.3 in the file right now,\nbut in this previous version,\n\n648\n00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,880\nit's got 12.4 right there.\n\n649\n00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,035\nAnd I can start to go back in time and\nlook at some of those other ones.\n\n650\n00:33:26,035 --> 00:33:27,330\nAll right?\n\n651\n00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,300\nNow I have a Time Machine hard drive.\n\n652\n00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,840\nIt's not hooked up right now.\n\n653\n00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,920\nMy Time Machine hard drive is\nnot hooked up on this system.\n\n654\n00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,000\nIt's pulling this from\nthe local copy of Time Machine.\n\n655\n00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,920\nRemember that from\nthe Time Machine episode.\n\n656\n00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,800\nThat your Mac will keep a local cache and\nit specifically does\n\n657\n00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,240\nit to support functionality like this,\nthe autosave feature.\n\n658\n00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,540\nRight.\nSo it's a key thing\n\n659\n00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,280\nthat's built into the OS.\n\n660\n00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,180\nAnd if you're ever curious to see it,\nlet me just get out of this real quick.\n\n661\n00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,660\nAnd jump into my terminal here.\n\n662\n00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,609\nWe can jump into the /volumes folder and\n\n663\n00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:07,997\nyou'll see a folder inside of /volumes,\nit's called mobile backups.\n\n664\n00:34:07,997 --> 00:34:11,318\nAnd that's the Time Machine cache where\nit's storing that locally right here.\n\n665\n00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:16,657\nAnd if I were to go in there and\nbrowse through the hierarchy.\n\n666\n00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:23,670\nBrowse as deep as I need to go and\ngo into the latest copy.\n\n667\n00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,970\nAnd just kinda keep browsing into there.\n\n668\n00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,900\nI am getting pretty deep into this thing.\n\n669\n00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,620\nBut if I get in here, I can come in and,\n\n670\n00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,732\noh I've got to get into my own\ndesktop first and get into desktop.\n\n671\n00:34:35,732 --> 00:34:39,990\nAnd into router configs and\n\n672\n00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:45,330\nI can find in here where\nit will have my hq.txt,\n\n673\n00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,050\nthere's that file that I was editing.\n\n674\n00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,800\nThat's where it's saved that copy\nbecause it's been modified since\n\n675\n00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,540\nthe last time I ran Time Machine.\n\n676\n00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,390\nSo, it's keeping track of that and\nauto saving for me.\n\n677\n00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,940\nPretty neat functionality.\n\n678\n00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,950\nAll right.\n\n679\n00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,290\nNow, there are some customizations we can\nmake to the way that Auto Save works.\n\n680\n00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,040\nOkay?\n\n681\n00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,670\nSo for example,\nmaybe I don't like Auto Save.\n\n682\n00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,930\nMaybe I don't want that feature.\n\n683\n00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,930\nThat's a terrible thing and\nI wanna turn it off.\n\n684\n00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,620\nWe can do that.\nAll right?\n\n685\n00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,850\nThe other thing is,\nwe can tailor what's called Resume.\n\n686\n00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,930\nAll right?\n\n687\n00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:20,720\nResume is how applications function when\nyou launch them after they were closed.\n\n688\n00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,360\nAll right?\n\n689\n00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,530\nSo for example I'm in text edit, right?\n\n690\n00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,960\nAnd I'm editing this hq.text.\n\n691\n00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,000\nAnd if I exit out of text edit.\n\n692\n00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,160\nAnd I'm gonna relaunch text edit.\n\n693\n00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,760\nJust manually launching it.\n\n694\n00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,270\nRight?\n\n695\n00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,560\nSee how I've opened up an empty document?\n\n696\n00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,200\nWhat happened to my hq.text?\n\n697\n00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,440\nWell it closed it.\n\n698\n00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,560\nAnd when I resumed,\nwhen I went back into text edit.\n\n699\n00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,770\nIt just created a blank document for me.\n\n700\n00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:48,720\nWell, that's actually something\nthat's defined by autosave.\n\n701\n00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,260\nAutosave controls the resume function.\n\n702\n00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,160\nBecause we can tell it hey,\n\n703\n00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,220\nwhen you resume an application,\nbring those old documents back up.\n\n704\n00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,139\nBring the documents I was working on\nback up so I'm right back where I was.\n\n705\n00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,990\nAnd I can get my information,\nI can work with things, right.\n\n706\n00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,860\nSo that's another thing\nthat we can tailor.\n\n707\n00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,710\nBoth of these functions are not\nvery intuitive to customize.\n\n708\n00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,470\nThey're in our system preferences.\n\n709\n00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,910\nSo let me get into my\nsystem preferences here.\n\n710\n00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,080\nAnd they're in the general\nsystem preference.\n\n711\n00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:21,600\nInside of the general system preference,\nyou'll see a number of options.\n\n712\n00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,190\nAnd each one lets me kind of\ncustomize different things,\n\n713\n00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,140\nwhether I want to show scroll bars and\nso on.\n\n714\n00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,540\nAnd then, the options I'm\ntalking about are right here.\n\n715\n00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,830\nAnd the names,\nthey don't mention auto save.\n\n716\n00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,030\nThey don't mention resume.\n\n717\n00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,760\nThat's what makes it a little unintuitive,\nbut\n\n718\n00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,520\nthat's what we're customizing, all right?\n\n719\n00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,720\nThis first one, ask to keep\nchanges when closing documents.\n\n720\n00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,640\nAll right, if I turn that on.\n\n721\n00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,860\nThat's disabling autosave.\n\n722\n00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,920\nI'm saying don't ever automatically save.\n\n723\n00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,120\nI wanna manually save.\n\n724\n00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,550\nIf I wanna save a document,\nI'll hit the Save button.\n\n725\n00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:55,040\nAnd if I close an application\nthat has documents open in it\n\n726\n00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,530\nI want it to prompt me and\nsay do you wanna save?\n\n727\n00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,090\nThat puts it back to the old way.\n\n728\n00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:02,300\nThat's the way things were\nbefore we had autosave.\n\n729\n00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,200\nIf I turn that off, don't ask me,\nthat doesn't mean don't do it, right.\n\n730\n00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,360\nIt means just go ahead and\ndo it, go ahead and save.\n\n731\n00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,270\nIf I close the application, I probably\nwanted to save what I was working on.\n\n732\n00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:17,140\nGo ahead and do it for me, and if that' s\nnot what I wanted, I'll use Time Machine.\n\n733\n00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,060\nI'll grab the previous version,\nit's there, I can get at it.\n\n734\n00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,900\nSo no big deal if I accidentally save\nsomething that I didn't wanna save.\n\n735\n00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,800\nSo that's what that first option is.\n\n736\n00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,770\nTurning auto save on or off.\n\n737\n00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,360\nThe second option is, close windows\nwhen quitting an app, all right.\n\n738\n00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,140\nWell, if you think about it,\nwhen you quit an app,\n\n739\n00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,230\nit's got to close all the windows right?\n\n740\n00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,990\nWhat that options really saying is,\n\n741\n00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:44,000\nthe next time you run the program, do we\ntreat those windows as still being open?\n\n742\n00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,190\nAnd the default is no.\n\n743\n00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,020\nWe close them.\n\n744\n00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,310\nRight.\nWhen you close the application,\n\n745\n00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,580\nit closes the windows.\n\n746\n00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:54,700\nWhen you open the application again,\nit opens a blank app, or a blank document.\n\n747\n00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,340\nIf I turn this option off, though.\n\n748\n00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,750\nNow I'm saying, when I quit the app,\ndon't close my windows.\n\n749\n00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,460\nThe windows will go away.\n\n750\n00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,140\nBut the next time I run the app,\n\n751\n00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,260\nit will open up the same exact\nwindows right where I left off.\n\n752\n00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,610\nOkay, and that's kind of convenient\ncuz it makes it really easy to get\n\n753\n00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,360\nright back to where you are working..\n\n754\n00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,070\nI know that I work at a laptop,\nso when I'm here at the office,\n\n755\n00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,290\nI plug my laptop into my\ndocking station and I work.\n\n756\n00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,180\nAnd at the end of the day I take my\nlaptop out of the docking station and\n\n757\n00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,580\nI take it home and I do the same\nthing there and I work, right?\n\n758\n00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:30,260\nWell, when I do that, if I had a bunch\nof documents open here at the office,\n\n759\n00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,980\nI don't wanna have to through all the\nreopening of all those documents again, so\n\n760\n00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,500\nI usually put my laptop to sleep.\n\n761\n00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,880\nI put it to sleep and then head home,\nand that way, I wake it up at home and\n\n762\n00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,160\nit's got all my documents right there.\n\n763\n00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,362\nBut with this feature turned off,\nwith close windows when quitting\n\n764\n00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:47,180\nan app is turned off, and\nask to keep changes is turned off.\n\n765\n00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,470\nWith those turned off,\nI can go ahead and shut my laptop down.\n\n766\n00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:55,450\nIt'll close all the programs, and when\nI get home I turn my laptop back on and\n\n767\n00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:59,820\nit reopens the programs with my data all\nright back to the place that it was.\n\n768\n00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,420\nIt makes it where I don't have\nto put my laptop to sleep.\n\n769\n00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,060\nAnd that's important, because a lot\nof us will put our laptop to sleep,\n\n770\n00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,850\nand then stick it in a laptop bag.\n\n771\n00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,330\nAnd it can overheat if it\ndoesn't actually hibernate.\n\n772\n00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:12,110\nIf it's sitting in that low power\nstate it can overheat in there.\n\n773\n00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,700\nAnd so\nthis is a neat thing to get around that.\n\n774\n00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,680\nLet me show you in an action.\n\n775\n00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,330\nSo I've got both of those\nturned off right now.\n\n776\n00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,752\nI'm gonna go in here and\nI'm gonna edit dr1.txt.\n\n777\n00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:28,000\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nopen that one, all right?\n\n778\n00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,882\nAnd maybe I'll edit\nheadquarters in text edit also.\n\n779\n00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:34,640\nAll right?\n\n780\n00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,310\nSo, now going back to text edit I've\ngot these two documents that are open.\n\n781\n00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,230\nBranch 1 and headquarters, right.\n\n782\n00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,100\nThey're both open.\n\n783\n00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,660\nLet me just bump up their font size so I\ncan actually see what's going on in there.\n\n784\n00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,174\nSo they're both open.\n\n785\n00:39:47,174 --> 00:39:49,761\nThey both say that they're version 12.4.\n\n786\n00:39:49,761 --> 00:39:51,555\nThat's from the file that I wrote.\n\n787\n00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,349\nI'm gonna change this one to 12.5.\n\n788\n00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:57,143\nAnd I'll change this one to 12.3,\nall right.\n\n789\n00:39:57,143 --> 00:39:59,220\nSo I'm just making some little\nmodifications to my files.\n\n790\n00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,590\nI'm gonna go ahead and save branch one.\n\n791\n00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:08,380\nI just did a command as, or a file save,\nand you'll see the edited flag went away.\n\n792\n00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,470\nOver here I've got headquarters.txt,\nit still shows as edited.\n\n793\n00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,240\nI haven't saved it yet.\n\n794\n00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,500\nAnd now I'll just go up here to text edit.\n\n795\n00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,000\nAnd I'll quit.\n\n796\n00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,130\nIt didn't ask me if I wanted to save.\n\n797\n00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,120\nIt just quit.\n\n798\n00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,060\nIt just got out and\nthat was it, all right?\n\n799\n00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:27,000\nAnd if I relaunch textEdit when I\nfire it back up, there's my windows.\n\n800\n00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,900\nThe windows went away, but\nit said when I relaunch,\n\n801\n00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,240\nI'm gonna take you right back into them.\n\n802\n00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:38,620\nAnd when I look at branch one,\nit shows as being version 12.5.\n\n803\n00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,990\nAnd if I look at headquarters,\nnot only does it show as version 12.3,\n\n804\n00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,700\nbut it also still shows edited.\n\n805\n00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,180\nIt shows that I haven't saved it.\n\n806\n00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,550\nAutosave saved it, but\nI didn't, all right?\n\n807\n00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,150\nSo it still shows as edited here,\neven though it did save the change.\n\n808\n00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,780\nIf I get out of textEdit and\nI go into my router configs,\n\n809\n00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,650\nand look let's edit headquarters\nin a different program.\n\n810\n00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,110\nSo here I'm firing up the headquarters\nfile in a different program and\n\n811\n00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,080\nit shows 12.3, right?\n\n812\n00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,080\nSo it did actually save it.\n\n813\n00:41:12,152 --> 00:41:16,100\nBut autosave let's us know that\nit was an automatic save, and\n\n814\n00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,130\nnot one that we did ourselves.\n\n815\n00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,060\nMy program here Write,\nit doesn't know that, right.\n\n816\n00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,970\nThe Write app doesn't support the native\nauto-save functionality in Mac OS, so\n\n817\n00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,140\nit doesn't know that.\n\n818\n00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,560\nAnd remember the way I know it\ndoesn't support it natively,\n\n819\n00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,240\nis under the file menu,\nI don't see the revert option.\n\n820\n00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,820\nI don't see the duplicate or\nrename options.\n\n821\n00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,150\nBecause that auto-save\nfunctionality isn't there.\n\n822\n00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,540\nPretty cool function built right in\nthe Mac OS, it's automated by the system,\n\n823\n00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,700\nit's ready to rock, ready to get in there\nand do the stuff that you need to do.\n\n824\n00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,700\nWe really don't have to tweak it very\nmuch, there's just those two main options,\n\n825\n00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,010\nand they're confusing.\n\n826\n00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,120\nConfusing options,\nespecially for the exam.\n\n827\n00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,460\nSo make sure you pay attention to these.\n\n828\n00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:03,580\nInside of the general system preferences,\nask to keep changes when closing windows.\n\n829\n00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,940\nThat's turning autosave on or off.\n\n830\n00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,270\nAll right?\n\n831\n00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:10,340\nIf it's on, if I check this off,\nthen auto-save is not working anymore.\n\n832\n00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,970\nI have to manually save.\n\n833\n00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,820\nIf it's unchecked like this, autosave\nis on, and it will automatically save.\n\n834\n00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,700\nThe next one,\nclose windows when quitting an app.\n\n835\n00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,300\nIf it's checked, my windows will\nclose when the app closes, and\n\n836\n00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,270\nwhen I open the app again,\nit'll be a new session.\n\n837\n00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:30,780\nIf it's unchecked, when I open the app\nnext time, it'll return my windows\n\n838\n00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,050\nright back to where they were, I'll be\nright at my documents and ready to go.\n\n839\n00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,950\nSo pretty cool functionality, neat stuff.\n\n840\n00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,690\nThat's all powered by autosave.\n\n841\n00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,130\nAll right.\nWell, I think that's about it for\n\n842\n00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,390\nour crazy bells and\nwhistles in this episode.\n\n843\n00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:48,090\nSo we got a chance to see quite\na bit of cool stuff today.\n\n844\n00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:51,300\nWe got a chance to see our\npreferences files and how they work,\n\n845\n00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,860\nwhat's stored inside of them.\n\n846\n00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,950\nWe got a chance to see the quick\nlook functionality and\n\n847\n00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,890\nhow it let's us preview\ncontents inside of a file and\n\n848\n00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:02,580\nwe got a chance to see autosave and\nthe way that it functions.\n\n849\n00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:07,100\nAll meets up, all built into Yosemite,\nno third party software required.\n\n850\n00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,880\nAll right, well that's about it for\nthis show.\n\n851\n00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,560\nSo let me remind you guys,\nif you have any questions on this stuff,\n\n852\n00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,600\nplease let me know.\n\n853\n00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,290\nLive during a show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live, and\n\n854\n00:43:17,290 -->

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:36,517 --> 00:00:38,729\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:40,210\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\n\n7\n00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,820\nback again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n8\n00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,630\nWell, in this episode we're gonna be\nwinding down the application section.\n\n9\n00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,590\nIn our previous episodes,\n\n10\n00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,970\nwe've covered installing applications and\nmaking sure they run smoothly.\n\n11\n00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,560\nAnd how they save their preferences and\nall that good stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,570\nIn this episode, we've really\ngot a grab bag of miscellaneous\n\n13\n00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,195\ntechnologies that all kind of\nrotate around our applications.\n\n14\n00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:05,210\nSo,we're gonna get to see\nsome neat stuff here.\n\n15\n00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,360\nThis just didn't quite fit\ninto the other categories.\n\n16\n00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,730\nThe first one that I wanna talk about\nis,probably one of the best examples of\n\n17\n00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,580\nsomething that doesn't fit in the other\ncategories and that's Java applications.\n\n18\n00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,940\nWhat is Java?\n\n19\n00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,430\nJava is a programming language\noriginally created by Sun microsystems.\n\n20\n00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,370\nAnd they were acquired by Oracle so\nnow it's Oracle Java.\n\n21\n00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,720\nAnd the idea behind Java was\nthat with a normal application\n\n22\n00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,070\na programmer has to right the application.\n\n23\n00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,550\nAnd then compile it for each operating\nsystem they want to support.\n\n24\n00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,440\nAnd that means they usually have to write\nit a little bit differently if they want\n\n25\n00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,890\nthe application to run on Windows and\nMacOS and Linux and\n\n26\n00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,180\nwhatever else is out there.\n\n27\n00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,000\nThey've got to rewrite the application\nmore than once to meet the needs of\n\n28\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,290\nthe different OSs.\n\n29\n00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,820\nAnd with Java, what Sun said\nwas let's create a framework.\n\n30\n00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,090\nA framework that real customized\nto run on each platform, and then\n\n31\n00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,510\nall the developers have to do is write\ntheir programs to work with our platform.\n\n32\n00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,860\nThen they don't have to customize their\nprogram for every operating system.\n\n33\n00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,110\nThey can write a program once,\nand it'll run on every OS.\n\n34\n00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,180\nIt sounded like a great idea,\nand back in the beginning,\n\n35\n00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,480\nback in the early 90s,\nit was really a revolutionary idea.\n\n36\n00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,030\nA lot of people adopted\nJava really quickly.\n\n37\n00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,230\nBut there were a few problems with it.\n\n38\n00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,600\nThe biggest problem with Java\nare the security concerns.\n\n39\n00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,170\nThere are a number of significant\nsecurity vulnerabilities that\n\n40\n00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,620\nhave come out over the last few\nyears that center around Java.\n\n41\n00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,880\nAnd that's made it a real challenge to\nget Java support like we used to have.\n\n42\n00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,070\nIn fact, if you install Mac OS Yosemite.\n\n43\n00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,020\nIt does not have Java\nsupport out of the box.\n\n44\n00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,240\nThat's different than some of the\ndifferent versions like in Mountain Lion.\n\n45\n00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,610\nWhen you installed Mountain Lion,\n\n46\n00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,570\nit had Java support baked\nin right out of the box.\n\n47\n00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,580\nWe don't have that in Yosemite anymore.\n\n48\n00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,180\nAll right?.\n\n49\n00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,210\nSo security concerns were one problem.\n\n50\n00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,917\nThe only problem I always joke\nabout is that the old slogan is,\n\n51\n00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:00,000\nwrite once run anywhere, right?\n\n52\n00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,460\nThey say you write your program once so\nyou could run it anywhere.\n\n53\n00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,640\nAnd I always said it should be called\nwrite once, run slowly anywhere.\n\n54\n00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,190\nJava applications are slow.\n\n55\n00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,110\nThey don't run very fast because\nthey're doing what's called just in\n\n56\n00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,280\ntime compiling.\n\n57\n00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,410\nWhen you run the application it's\nlaying it on top of a Java framework,\n\n58\n00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,760\nwhat's called the Java\nrun time environment.\n\n59\n00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,670\nAnd that Java run time\nenvironment is executing that\n\n60\n00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,030\nprogram inside of a Java space and\nthat takes time.\n\n61\n00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,130\nIt slows things down.\n\n62\n00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,710\nYou're not running one program.\n\n63\n00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,700\nYou're actually running two.\n\n64\n00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,880\nYou're running the program\nthe developer created, and then you're\n\n65\n00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,470\nrunning an interpreter that's translating\nit into what a Mac is expecting.\n\n66\n00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,450\nAnd that's not the most\nefficient thing in the world.\n\n67\n00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,800\nAll I being said,\ntons of companies still use Java for\n\n68\n00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,100\na lot of things and\nI know from the security perspective alone\n\n69\n00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,220\nI do not like to have Java\ninstalled on my machines.\n\n70\n00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,330\nI typically uninstall it if it's\nalready on there but every now and\n\n71\n00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,580\nthen you will come across some\napplication that requires Java to run.\n\n72\n00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,970\nSo for example I took a course\nat a college not too long ago\n\n73\n00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,140\nwhere they had lab machines you\ncould remote in to and connect to.\n\n74\n00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,670\nAnd the viewer was Java only.\n\n75\n00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,750\nOr I've got a Firewall here in the office\nthat it's a Cisco firewall and\n\n76\n00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,550\nthe management software for\nit is Java only.\n\n77\n00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,140\nIf I want to manage that firewall.\n\n78\n00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,680\nI've gotta use their Java software,\n\n79\n00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,370\nand that means I've gotta\ninstall Java on my machine.\n\n80\n00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,830\nSo it's not uncommon to run into that,\na lot of people have to run it.\n\n81\n00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,330\nWell, if it's not installed on\nyour machine by default and\n\n82\n00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,020\nyou need it, where do we get it?\n\n83\n00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,610\nWe've got two choices.\n\n84\n00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,630\nI've said that Apple no longer includes it\nwith the OS, and that's absolutely true.\n\n85\n00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,630\nLet me show you how to test that, right?\n\n86\n00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,340\nIf you're ever on a Mac and\nyou wanna know if it has Java or\n\n87\n00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,780\nnot, well you can search for it,\nlike I could bring up spotlight and\n\n88\n00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,240\ndo a search for Java and\nsee if it turns up.\n\n89\n00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,290\nBut it may not actually turn up\nthere even if it is installed.\n\n90\n00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,990\nThe number one best way to tell wether\nyou've got Java is to open up a terminal.\n\n91\n00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:01,015\nAnd in your terminal window,\njust type java--version.\n\n92\n00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,910\nThis command right here will tell\nyou not only if you have Java but\n\n93\n00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,270\nif you do,\nwhat version of it you're running?\n\n94\n00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,485\nSo I'll just run Java--version and when\nI run that, see the message that I got?\n\n95\n00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:17,132\nNo Java runtime present,\nrequesting install.\n\n96\n00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:18,260\nAll right?\n\n97\n00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,570\nSo I don't have Java on this machine.\n\n98\n00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,760\nIf I want it,\nI'm going to have to install it.\n\n99\n00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,230\nNow, it prompts me with this window.\n\n100\n00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,000\nIt says here to use Java to command\nline tool, you need to install the JDK.\n\n101\n00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,537\nAll right?\n\n102\n00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,000\nJDK stands for Java Development Kit.\n\n103\n00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,930\nIf you're gonna be a Java developer,\nyou're gonna write Java software,\n\n104\n00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,710\nyou install the JDK.\n\n105\n00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,440\nMost of us though,\naren't gonna be a developer.\n\n106\n00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,530\nWe really just need what's called the JRE,\nthe Java Runtime Environment.\n\n107\n00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,420\nThat's enough for us to be able\nto execute Java applications, and\n\n108\n00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,830\nthat's typically all we need.\n\n109\n00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,660\nAll right.\n\n110\n00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,550\nNow it's offering for\nme to hit More Info to get additional\n\n111\n00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,150\ninformation about this or\nI can just say okay to dismiss it.\n\n112\n00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,050\nIf I hit More Info,\nit's gonna fire up a web browser and\n\n113\n00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,390\nit's gonna take me to Oracle, all right?\n\n114\n00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,480\nOracle is the company that owns Java now.\n\n115\n00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,080\nIt was originally developed by\nSun Microsystems, but now it's at Oracle.\n\n116\n00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,440\nAnd if we want to install Java\non our system, we can do that.\n\n117\n00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,000\nYou'll see there are several\ndifferent versions of Java.\n\n118\n00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,070\nThis is the page that Apple sends you to,\nbut\n\n119\n00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:22,711\nthe easier page if we want to install\nJava is to just go to java.com.\n\n120\n00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:26,800\nJava.com is a webpage owned by\nOracle that's designed to make it\n\n121\n00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,480\nreally easy to install Java.\n\n122\n00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,620\nNow the current version of Java is Java 8.\n\n123\n00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,850\nApple has blacklisted the certificates for\nevery previous version of Java.\n\n124\n00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,130\nSo if you try and install Java 7 or\nJava 6, the Java runtime environments for\n\n125\n00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,750\nthose, you're gonna get a red flag.\n\n126\n00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,410\nIt's gonna warn you, and\nit's not gonna let the install go in,\n\n127\n00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,590\nunless you disable Gatekeeper and a few\nother security features on your system.\n\n128\n00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,410\nWhich you don't want to do.\n\n129\n00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,020\nThe reason they did that is there are some\nknown exploits that are out there\n\n130\n00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,660\nin the wild that hackers can use right\nnow to infect and damage your machine.\n\n131\n00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,200\nAnd so the way Apple protects you\nfrom that is saying you can only run\n\n132\n00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,920\nthe newest version of Java,\nthe Java 8 version.\n\n133\n00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,380\nSo if you're trying to install a previous\nversion of Java and it's failing,\n\n134\n00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,460\nthat's probably why.\n\n135\n00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,350\nIt's not gonna let you do that.\n\n136\n00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,790\nIt's gonna stop it from running.\n\n137\n00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,060\nNow in the past,\nJava used to be included with Mac OS.\n\n138\n00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,960\nAnd that version that was included,\nthat was actually made by Apple.\n\n139\n00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,840\nIt wasn't made by Oracle,\nit was made by Apple.\n\n140\n00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,630\nThey created their own internal one.\n\n141\n00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:35,800\nThey took the Java code and customized\nit to meet their security requirements.\n\n142\n00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,970\nWhen they stopped baking it\ninto the operating system,\n\n143\n00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,640\nthey stopped providing\ntheir own version of Java.\n\n144\n00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,270\nAll right?\n\n145\n00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,590\nBut they do still have it, so if you ever\nrun into a scenario where you come up with\n\n146\n00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,370\na developer and the developer says, we\nwrote this program specifically to support\n\n147\n00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,580\nApple's version of Java, well,\nApple's version of Java is gone now.\n\n148\n00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,030\nThat doesn't mean it's gone completely,\nthough.\n\n149\n00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,473\nYou can go in and install it.\n\n150\n00:07:57,473 --> 00:08:01,355\nApple doesn't package it with the OS,\nbecause they want it to be as secure as\n\n151\n00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,520\npossible, but if you absolutely\nneed their version of Java.\n\n152\n00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,078\nYou can still get it from Apple's website,\nright?\n\n153\n00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:11,280\nAnd I'll post this in the show notes,\nwhen this episode gets up on the website.\n\n154\n00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,150\nBut I've got a link in the show\nnotes to Apple's webpage,\n\n155\n00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,580\nwhere you can actually go to\ndownload their version of Java.\n\n156\n00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,664\nSo if I wanted to go and get the one from\nApple, you would go to the support page.\n\n157\n00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:31,930\nAnd see how it says Java for\nOS X 2014-001, well this is the year 2015.\n\n158\n00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,130\nIt's old.\n\n159\n00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,380\nIt's not updated like it used to be.\n\n160\n00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,030\nIn fact, it's based off the Java\nruntime environment for version 6.\n\n161\n00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,520\nSo this is based on GRE 6.\n\n162\n00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,120\nThat's pretty old.\n\n163\n00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:49,150\nBut Apple has found it to be secure, found\nit to be safe, and they make it available.\n\n164\n00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,230\nBut that's why it still\nhas the lion logo up here.\n\n165\n00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,630\nIt's not being updated anymore.\n\n166\n00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,250\nApple is not gonna push anything\nbeyond the security update to it.\n\n167\n00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,870\nSo if you have to have it, you can come\nin here, and you can download it and\n\n168\n00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,060\nget it right from Apple, if you want.\n\n169\n00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,910\nBut, it is Java 6.\n\n170\n00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,880\nMore ideally, you'll wanna get it from\nOracle so you get the latest one.\n\n171\n00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,340\nAnd it's Java 8.\n\n172\n00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,920\nAnd if I just go to java.com and\n\n173\n00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,910\nhit the free Java download button,\nit's gonna let me agree and download it.\n\n174\n00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,040\nAnd see how it says recommended version 8,\nupdate 31, all right.\n\n175\n00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,610\nSo Java version 8 came out last year,\nand there's been 31 updates to it.\n\n176\n00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,440\nAll security updates to improve\nthe reliability of the software.\n\n177\n00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,200\nBut, you can agree and download it.\n\n178\n00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,040\nAnd when it downloads,\nit installs like most software.\n\n179\n00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,690\nIt's gonna download onto my machine, and\n\n180\n00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,420\nthen it's going to be a packaged\nfile that we'll install.\n\n181\n00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,050\nAnd that will add that framework to\nenable us to run Java applications.\n\n182\n00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,989\nOnce that's done,\nwe'll be able to run those.\n\n183\n00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,658\nSo if I jump into my downloads folder and\nI find my install file.\n\n184\n00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:52,290\nI'm trying to jump to my downloads file.\n\n185\n00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,230\nThere we go.\n\n186\n00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,610\nI can see where I just installed.\n\n187\n00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,580\nAnd see how it says JRE, right?\n\n188\n00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,350\nJava Runtime Environment.\n\n189\n00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,030\nI didn't actually download\nthe JDK cuz I'm not a developer.\n\n190\n00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,770\nI'm not gonna write a Java app.\n\n191\n00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,320\nI just needed the runtime environment,\nand that's what it downloaded.\n\n192\n00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,120\nIt's just a DMG file.\n\n193\n00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,450\nAnd notice also that it says jre8u31,\nso version eight, update 31.\n\n194\n00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,910\nIt's MacOSX.\n\n195\n00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,570\nThis is the Mac version,\nthere's a different one for windows, and\n\n196\n00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,000\na different one for Linux.\n\n197\n00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,970\nAnd this one says x64.\n\n198\n00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,040\nThis is the 64 bit version of Java.\n\n199\n00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,760\nThere is a 32 bit version also.\n\n200\n00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,040\nAnd I'm gonna talk later in this episode\nabout the difference between 32 bit and\n\n201\n00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,230\n64 bit applications.\n\n202\n00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,320\nBut, it went ahead and\npulled the 64 bit one for me.\n\n203\n00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,270\nAnd it's just a DMG.\n\n204\n00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,100\nIt's a disk image file.\n\n205\n00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,830\nAnd so if I double click on that,\nit'll mount and open, and\n\n206\n00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,370\nI'll see the installer for Java.\n\n207\n00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,110\nNow, Java is not an application by itself.\n\n208\n00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,160\nIt's a framework.\n\n209\n00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,280\nIt allows other applications to run.\n\n210\n00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,170\nSo this is not an app that you drag and\ndrop to your applications folder.\n\n211\n00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,480\nIt's more like a driver.\n\n212\n00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,570\nIt's low level system software.\n\n213\n00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,990\nSo it ships as a PKG, a package file.\n\n214\n00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,580\nWhen you load a package,\n\n215\n00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,020\nthat's gonna copy to some of your global\nlocations on the drive to be installed.\n\n216\n00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,750\nNow, I'm getting a warning here telling me\nthat it can't be opened because it wasn't\n\n217\n00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,620\ndownloaded from the Mac App Store.\n\n218\n00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,130\nWell in a previous episode,\n\n219\n00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,090\nI had locked my machine down so that it\nwould only run things from the App Store.\n\n220\n00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,430\nSo I need to relax that a little bit.\n\n221\n00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,680\nI'm gonna go into my system preferences,\nand security and privacy.\n\n222\n00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,930\nAnd here, I can see where I've got\nit locked down to the App Store.\n\n223\n00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,220\nI'm gonna have to relax\nthat just a little bit so\n\n224\n00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,450\nthat I'll be able to do this install.\n\n225\n00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,230\nSo I'm gonna move it down to\nMac App Store, and identified developers.\n\n226\n00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,450\nAnd now when I go and double-click on\nthat, it's a little bit happier for me.\n\n227\n00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,010\nAll right?\n\n228\n00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,090\nSo I get that message there.\n\n229\n00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,530\nThe Java 8 is installing.\n\n230\n00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,340\nI can just hit Continue.\n\n231\n00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,010\nIt's gonna ask what installation type.\n\n232\n00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,540\nNotice I didn't get to pick a destination.\n\n233\n00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,200\nThis is low level, so it's actually gonna\ninstall it globally on the system, and\n\n234\n00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,719\nit'll be available for all users.\n\n235\n00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,880\nWe'll go ahead and let that install.\n\n236\n00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,840\nAnd once it's done,\nmy system will now support Java.\n\n237\n00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,000\nAnd so if I have any Java applications\nthat are out there that I get from the web\n\n238\n00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,410\nor from wherever,\nI'll now be able to run those.\n\n239\n00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,160\nAll right.\nSo there it goes, it's installed.\n\n240\n00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,780\nAnd if I want to verify\nthat it's installed,\n\n241\n00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,670\nI can repeat my test form\nthe beginning of the show.\n\n242\n00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,670\nI can fire up my terminal.\n\n243\n00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,360\nAnd in the terminal window,\nI can run java --version.\n\n244\n00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,440\nAnd this time, I should get a response.\n\n245\n00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,020\nActually, you know what?\n\n246\n00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,530\nI'm gonna get this prompt\nbecause I haven't restarted.\n\n247\n00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,620\nIt's a package.\n\n248\n00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,290\nIt installs in the base OS, and so it\nrequires a reboot before it takes effect.\n\n249\n00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,430\nIt's not in the path and\nall that stuff yet.\n\n250\n00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,380\nSo I need to do that.\n\n251\n00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,480\nSo I'll go ahead and\ngive this machine a reboot.\n\n252\n00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,290\nAnd while we wait on that I'll\ntalk about some other things.\n\n253\n00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,510\nAll right, so\nwe'll let that machine restart.\n\n254\n00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,520\nKey things to remember about Java,\nit's a security target.\n\n255\n00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,870\nA lot of hackers target that\nspecifically because they know that\n\n256\n00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,860\nif you're running Java, they can\nprobably execute various code on it.\n\n257\n00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,520\nA lot of people develop Java\napplications non-securely, and\n\n258\n00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,270\nthat makes them risky to run.\n\n259\n00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,790\nSo when you have Java, you need to\nmake sure you do your Java updates.\n\n260\n00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,770\nYou'll get prompted periodically every few\ndays, for it to check for various updates.\n\n261\n00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,810\nIf an update is out,\nyou need to perform it.\n\n262\n00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,060\nYou need to go ahead and do it to make\nsure that your system stays up to date.\n\n263\n00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,110\nAll right.\n\n264\n00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,200\nIf you just needed Java to\nrun one application, and\n\n265\n00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,340\nyou're done with that application,\nyou should go ahead and uninstall Java.\n\n266\n00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,260\nDon't keep it around if you don't need it.\n\n267\n00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,810\nIt is a security liability.\n\n268\n00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,770\nIt's not something we want to\nkeep around if we don't have to.\n\n269\n00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,750\nAll right, let's see.\n\n270\n00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,500\nSo that's basically the basics of Java.\n\n271\n00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,340\nAnd, there we go.\n\n272\n00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,690\nSo I'm rebooted now.\n\n273\n00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,960\nIf I get into my terminal.\n\n274\n00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,070\nLet's do a little java --version.\n\n275\n00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,620\nAnd see what we get this time.\n\n276\n00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,720\nAnd still not seeing my Java runtime.\n\n277\n00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,660\nLet's just verify whether or\nnot that actually installed.\n\n278\n00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,531\nSee if I can.\n\n279\n00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,760\nI have to try and\nremember where it buried that away.\n\n280\n00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,650\nI might just be missing\ncommand line utility.\n\n281\n00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,210\nLet's see if it shows up\nin my system preferences.\n\n282\n00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,760\nWhen you install java, it adds a system\npreference down to the bottom.\n\n283\n00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,450\nYeah, there it is.\n\n284\n00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,810\nSo I can see it did actually install.\n\n285\n00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,190\nIt must not have installed the command\nline utility as part of the JRE.\n\n286\n00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,540\nBut I can see right here in my system\npreferences at the bottom of this screen,\n\n287\n00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,100\nI now have an icon for Java.\n\n288\n00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,780\nThis bottom part of system preferences is\nwhere the third party application show up.\n\n289\n00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,440\nAnd so, I can double-click on that\nto view information about Java.\n\n290\n00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,430\nAnd it's gonna lauch\nmy Java control panel.\n\n291\n00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,780\nAnd I can see right\nhere that it's running.\n\n292\n00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,670\nI can hit About and\nfind out what version I'm running.\n\n293\n00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,180\nSo, I'm running version 8, update 31.\n\n294\n00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,560\nYou can see it right there.\n\n295\n00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,890\nSo, I'm good to go..\n\n296\n00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,740\nAnd on my update tab, here's where\nit says that it's going to check for\n\n297\n00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,978\nupdates automatically, and it checked\njust a few minutes ago at 9:54 AM.\n\n298\n00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:38,720\n>> All right?\n\n299\n00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,555\nDefinitely, keep Java updated.\n\n300\n00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:43,475\nBut once you've got it,\nnow you can run Java Applications,\n\n301\n00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:46,195\nyou can access any of those resources and\nrun them.\n\n302\n00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:47,705\nBut that is going to be a key component.\n\n303\n00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:48,455\nMain thing to remember for\n\n304\n00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:53,895\nthe exam is that Java support used to\nbe baked into the OS, it no longer is.\n\n305\n00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:58,975\nNow, we have to install it.\n\n306\n00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:02,010\nThe next thing I want to\ntalk about is iCloud.\n\n307\n00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:06,480\nWhen we install Yosemite,\nit's one of the first Mac OSs to\n\n308\n00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,010\ncompletely pester you about\nlogging in with an Apple ID.\n\n309\n00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,810\nApple is making a big push for\nyou to start storing data in the cloud.\n\n310\n00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,910\nAnd so, they've actually been making\nthe move towards this for a while.\n\n311\n00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,840\nWe saw a big push forward in Mavericks,\nbut\n\n312\n00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,650\nYosemite is the first one\nto really force it one you.\n\n313\n00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,320\nSo when you first install Mac OS Yosemite,\nand you're booting up into it,\n\n314\n00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,100\nit asks you to log in with an Apple ID.\n\n315\n00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,140\nAnd you can tell it not to,\nbut it wants to.\n\n316\n00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,720\nAnd then as you start to run your\nsoftware and you set up things like your\n\n317\n00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,130\nKeychain and other resources like that,\nit's gonna continue to prompt you.\n\n318\n00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,800\nSaying are you sure you don't\nwanna log in with an Apple ID?\n\n319\n00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,530\nThey really want you to log in\nbecause as soon as you log in,\n\n320\n00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,720\nyou're Mac can get connected to iCloud.\n\n321\n00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,160\nAnd it can backup your data.\n\n322\n00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,950\nIt can give you a central place\nto store your information.\n\n323\n00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,068\nYou can get those Unity features,\nwhere when your cell phone rings,\n\n324\n00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:55,860\nyou get a notification on your laptop.\n\n325\n00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,750\nYou can send text messages from Mac OS.\n\n326\n00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,328\nYou can do a lot of cool things\nwhen you link to an Apple ID.\n\n327\n00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:04,089\nIf you don't None of those features work.\n\n328\n00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,308\nYou don't get any of that functionality.\n\n329\n00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:09,270\nSo that's something that Apple\nobviously wants you to have.\n\n330\n00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,350\nThey want you to have those features and\nit's all a part of iCloud.\n\n331\n00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,310\nWell in an earlier episode I talk\nabout a feature called auto save.\n\n332\n00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,110\nAnd auto save was something\nbuilt into the operating system.\n\n333\n00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,210\nWhere when we were running applications,\n\n334\n00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,320\nthey would automatically save\nin the background, right.\n\n335\n00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,780\nIt was a nice feature and it's something a\nlot of programs all ready had natively, or\n\n336\n00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,980\nbuilt into the app, but\nnow it's part of the OS.\n\n337\n00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,500\nWhy did Apple do that?\n\n338\n00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,720\nWell they did it because\nthat was the first stage\n\n339\n00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,390\nof moving people over to iCloud, right.\n\n340\n00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,250\nNow you're automatically saving,\ndo you know where you're saving to?\n\n341\n00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,020\nWho cares?\n\n342\n00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,000\nIt auto saves, right.\n\n343\n00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,030\nI don't care where it saves to\nas long as I know that it saved.\n\n344\n00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:52,090\nSo that enabled Apple to then slowly roll\nout features like, making you autosave\n\n345\n00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,900\nto iCloud, instead of just saving to the\nlocal disk let's save up to the iCloud.\n\n346\n00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,250\nAnd iCloud can track multiple versions of\nthe same document because we're linked and\n\n347\n00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,280\nwe can upload to it.\n\n348\n00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,190\nSo it makes things really simple.\n\n349\n00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,640\nThat's really their goal,\n\n350\n00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,180\nApple wanted people to be able to use\ntheir cloud without having to install\n\n351\n00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:12,110\nextra clients and set up things, do crazy\nconfigurations here, you just log in.\n\n352\n00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,200\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n353\n00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,610\nHere on my desktop,\nif I go into my System Preferences.\n\n354\n00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,453\nIn my System Preferences I've got\na system preference called iCloud.\n\n355\n00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:24,850\nAnd if I go into that I\ncan see if whether or\n\n356\n00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,751\nnot I am currently signed for\niCloud, and on my machine, I'm not.\n\n357\n00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:31,530\nSo I see that it is prompting me\nto sign in, so if I go ahead and\n\n358\n00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:37,340\nsign in with an account,\nI can go ahead and do that.\n\n359\n00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,520\nAnd then it'll connect me.\n\n360\n00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,090\nNow if you don't have\nan account they are free.\n\n361\n00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,000\nThey don't cost you a dime.\n\n362\n00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,570\nAnd you can sign up and\nit'll create you some iCloud storage and\n\n363\n00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,740\nyou'll be able to back up to it.\n\n364\n00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,150\nSo use that creat Apple ID\nlink right there.\n\n365\n00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,520\nBut in my case I've already got\nan account, so I'll sign in.\n\n366\n00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,220\nAnd once I'm signed in, in the background\nit's gonna start connecting services.\n\n367\n00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,290\nAnd that's why I get this legal\ndisclaimer, this warning, saying\n\n368\n00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,870\nyou're gonna be using Apple services, but\nif something goes wrong, don't sue us.\n\n369\n00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,090\nRight, I mean that's basically\nwhat all this boils down to.\n\n370\n00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,030\nI'll go ahead and agree to that,\nand hit Continue.\n\n371\n00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,990\nAnd now, I'll be connected to iCloud.\n\n372\n00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:16,510\nNow I'm not gonna see too much difference\nin the way that my system functions.\n\n373\n00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,980\nOnce I'm connected to iCloud,\nthe whole point is to be seamless and\n\n374\n00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,370\ninvisible, right.\n\n375\n00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,920\nSo I'm connected,\neverything looks the same.\n\n376\n00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,630\nI work like I normally work.\n\n377\n00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,220\nBut here's what's different.\n\n378\n00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,420\nWhat's different is if\nI go into my Finder.\n\n379\n00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,307\nIn my finder,\nI have iCloud drive, all right.\n\n380\n00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,180\nYou've got Applications, Desktop,\nDocuments, Downloads, right?\n\n381\n00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,810\nWhen I save a document,\nI'll put it in the Documents folder.\n\n382\n00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,040\nBut now, I've got this iCloud drive also.\n\n383\n00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,580\nAnd the iCloud drive,\nthat's cloud storage.\n\n384\n00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,690\nStorage that's on Apple's servers,\nand it's copied to your machine too.\n\n385\n00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,230\nSo when you're working with a document,\nyou're actually working with a local copy.\n\n386\n00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,510\nAnd auto-save is automatically\nsaving that local copy, and\n\n387\n00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,420\nin the background,\niCloud is uploading it into iCloud.\n\n388\n00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,200\nNow, when I first enabled iCloud,\nif I go back to my system preferences,\n\n389\n00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,430\nit only turned on a couple of features for\nme.\n\n390\n00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,890\nIt turned on Find My Mac, and\n\n391\n00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:22,260\nit turned on just the basic iCloud\nApple ID sync, right, and that was it.\n\n392\n00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,110\nIf I go back into the iCloud\nsystem preference,\n\n393\n00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,550\nnotice how the screen\nlooks a lot different now.\n\n394\n00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,570\nNow there's a lot of other stuff in here.\n\n395\n00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,890\nI see Find My Mac,\nBack to My Mac, Calendar, Mail,\n\n396\n00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,140\niCloud Drive, all these different\nservices, and see how they're turned off?\n\n397\n00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,860\nJust because I signed into\nmy Apple ID doesn't mean it\n\n398\n00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,040\nactually turned that stuff on,\nit's all off.\n\n399\n00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,950\nAnd it's up to me to turn that on, and\n\n400\n00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,610\nthat's why in finder, when I browse\nthe iCloud Drive, see what it says?\n\n401\n00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,250\nTurn on iCloud Drive to store\nyour files in iCloud and\n\n402\n00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,030\naccess them at any time\non all of your devices.\n\n403\n00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,950\nIt's pretty cool, right?\n\n404\n00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,590\nA pretty neat feature.\n\n405\n00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,900\nJust signing in isn't enough,\nyou have to go and turn these on.\n\n406\n00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,050\nApple wants your data to be safe.\n\n407\n00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,080\nAnd if you don't want your data in\nthe cloud, they're not gonna force you.\n\n408\n00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,880\nThat's why it didn't turn on by default.\n\n409\n00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,820\nYou signed in, but\nyou have to willingly tell it, yes,\n\n410\n00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,520\nI wanna save my stuff in the cloud,\nall right.\n\n411\n00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,750\nAnd this button here that says,\nOpen iCloud Preferences.\n\n412\n00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,110\nThat just takes you to this screen right\nhere, to the system preference for iCloud.\n\n413\n00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,580\nSo, in here, I can go through and\n\n414\n00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,970\nI can set up all the different\nthings that I need to do.\n\n415\n00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,560\nI can set up my iCloud drive.\n\n416\n00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,780\nSo, I want to be able to store data in\niCloud, so I'm just gonna check that off\n\n417\n00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,991\nand I'll hit Continue to upgrade\nme to iCloud drive now, all right.\n\n418\n00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:36,690\nIt's done, that wasn't hard,\nI just checked it off.\n\n419\n00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,245\nBut there are some options over here,\nif you click on Options,\n\n420\n00:20:40,245 --> 00:20:43,598\nyou'll see a few things that\nyou can tweak and it says here,\n\n421\n00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:47,174\napps that store documents and\ndata in iCloud will appear here.\n\n422\n00:20:47,174 --> 00:20:52,960\nNot every application is to designed\nto save data in iCloud, all right.\n\n423\n00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,840\nDid I install textWrangler on this system?\n\n424\n00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,100\nYeah, so I have textWrangler\ninstalled on my system.\n\n425\n00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,500\nHere it is, I can write text files and\n\n426\n00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,407\nI can save it but, notice textWrangler\nis not on that list, right.\n\n427\n00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,000\nBy default,\ntextWrangler doesn't save in to iCloud.\n\n428\n00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,480\nIt can, you can make it.\n\n429\n00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,480\nWhen you save a document,\nyou have to tell it to save in to iCloud.\n\n430\n00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,600\nVersus these applications that\nwill do it automatically.\n\n431\n00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,690\nMost developers are adding\niCloud drive support right now.\n\n432\n00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,300\nSo you're starting to see applications\nupdate that will have that support\n\n433\n00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,520\nbuilt into them.\n\n434\n00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,340\nIf they don't natively support iCloud, it\ndoesn't mean you can't use it, it's just\n\n435\n00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,880\nyou'll have to manually choose that\nlocation when you go to save your files.\n\n436\n00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,020\nAll right, so\nI've got iCloud drive turned on.\n\n437\n00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,780\nI could turn on some of these other\nthings if I wanted Contacts, Calendars,\n\n438\n00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,152\nReminders, all that other good stuff.\n\n439\n00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:42,840\nI'm gonna leave that off for now,\nwe'll just stick with iCloud drive.\n\n440\n00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,004\nAll right so, now when I click\non iCloud drive what do I see?\n\n441\n00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:51,520\nIt's an empty folder,\nnot terribly exciting, right.\n\n442\n00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,940\nBut it is there and I can go and\nI can take my documents and\n\n443\n00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,800\nI can move them over.\n\n444\n00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,810\nI can do a little drag and drop and\nthrow them in the iCloud drive.\n\n445\n00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,771\nAnd so now, that sample data\nthat txt file is there, and\n\n446\n00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:05,410\nsee how it says syncing beneath it, right?\n\n447\n00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,600\nAnd then syncing just disappeared.\n\n448\n00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:11,420\nSampledata.txt is local, it's being\nstored right here on my hard drive.\n\n449\n00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,000\nAnd it's being synchronized to iCloud.\n\n450\n00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,160\nAnd as I work with that file, as I make\nchanges to it, and I update and I save it,\n\n451\n00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,150\nit saves to my hard drive first, and\nthen it synchronizes it up to iCloud.\n\n452\n00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,150\nAnd if I'm disconnected from the network,\nright, maybe I'm on an airplane and\n\n453\n00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,650\nI'm in airplane mode,\nor I'm on a train and\n\n454\n00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,090\nI just don't have internet access,\nand I make a bunch of edits.\n\n455\n00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,370\nWhen I land at my destination and I go to\nthe hotel and get on the wireless there,\n\n456\n00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,550\nit'll upload all the stuff that I\nworked on those previous hours,\n\n457\n00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,380\nit keeps you in sync.\n\n458\n00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,030\nAnd the goal is, if your laptop fails,\nyour hard drive fails,\n\n459\n00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,650\nyour device is stolen,\nyou accidentally delete something,\n\n460\n00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,430\nthat you'll be able to go to iCloud and\nrecover it.\n\n461\n00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,910\nThat's the goal and that it be seamless.\n\n462\n00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,910\nWe just treat this like another folder.\n\n463\n00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,000\nWhen I save something in documents,\nit's pretty easy.\n\n464\n00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,130\nWhen I save it in iCloud, it's the same.\n\n465\n00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,210\nIt's just as easy,\nit's just a different folder.\n\n466\n00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,840\nAnd so it's right there in finder, I can\nbrowse to it, and even in my applications.\n\n467\n00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,490\nNow when I go into text edit, that's\none of my native applications, right.\n\n468\n00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,230\nSo it supports saving in to iCloud,\nno problem.\n\n469\n00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,650\nAnd as I save that data, in the background\nsee how the word syncing appeared, and\n\n470\n00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,840\nit's now saving.\n\n471\n00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,420\nSee how it also created a TextEdit folder,\nthough?\n\n472\n00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,340\nEven if I hadn't saved it into iCloud,\nTextEdit is iCloud integrated.\n\n473\n00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,590\nSo if I start creating new\ndocuments in TextEdit, so\n\n474\n00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,191\nif I just fire up TextEdit,\nnot TextWrangler, I wanted TextEdit.\n\n475\n00:23:35,191 --> 00:23:38,930\n[LAUGH] If I fire up\nTextEdit by itself and\n\n476\n00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,446\nI just start creating new documents,\nright.\n\n477\n00:23:41,446 --> 00:23:44,656\nSo here, I'm just gonna create\nan all new document in TextEdit.\n\n478\n00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:51,068\nAnd I'll save it, when I go to save it,\n\n479\n00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:55,279\nsee how the Where is\nlisted as TextEdit-iCloud.\n\n480\n00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,253\nTextEdit supports iCloud,\nit's gonna save there by default.\n\n481\n00:23:56,253 --> 00:24:02,372\nAnd so this is my new document.txt\nI guess this is rtf, I don't know.\n\n482\n00:24:02,372 --> 00:24:03,822\nAnd I'll go and save that.\n\n483\n00:24:03,822 --> 00:24:07,340\nAnd it's gonna save it\nright in the iCloud.\n\n484\n00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,260\nAnd it's gonna put it in\nthe Text Edit folder and there it is.\n\n485\n00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,860\nThere's my new document.\n\n486\n00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,736\nAnd see how Sample Data is in here also,\nright?\n\n487\n00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:16,770\nSample Data.\n\n488\n00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,490\nI manually copied that in\nthe iCloud right here.\n\n489\n00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,220\nBut because I used it in Text Edit and\n\n490\n00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:26,760\nText Edit is ICloud native, it made a copy\nof it right there in it's own system.\n\n491\n00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,930\nBe careful with that because you can\nend up with more than one of the same\n\n492\n00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,531\nfile, right?\n\n493\n00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:34,180\nYou can end up with a file that has\nchanges on one side and not on the other.\n\n494\n00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,180\nYou can start to get kind of confusion.\n\n495\n00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,060\nAnd the operating system tries\nto sort that out for you, right?\n\n496\n00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,880\nSeeing how it doesn't just\nsay Sample Data.txt here.\n\n497\n00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,810\nIt says Sample Data.txt in iCloud Drive.\n\n498\n00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,960\nIf I turn on my path bar.\n\n499\n00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,570\nLet me just show the path bar here.\n\n500\n00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,690\nYou can see that I'm in my iCloud Drive,\nbut\n\n501\n00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,800\nI'm in that Text Edit folder also, right?\n\n502\n00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,680\nVersus here,\nwhere I'm outside of the Text Edit folder,\n\n503\n00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,870\nI'm just in the iCloud drive,\nright there, right?\n\n504\n00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,730\nIf I open this with,\nlet me open this with a Text Wrangler.\n\n505\n00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,350\nSo I'm gonna open this with text wrangler.\n\n506\n00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,770\nText wrangler is not iCloud drive aware.\n\n507\n00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:19,600\nSo I'm making a change,\nin a non iCloud aware program.\n\n508\n00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,010\nAll right, and I'll just save that.\n\n509\n00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,110\nI saved it and\nI'll get out of a text wrangler, okay?\n\n510\n00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,720\nIt says syncing, it's updating it and\nit's copying it up to iCloud.\n\n511\n00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,000\nThere it is.\n\n512\n00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,650\nIf I go to Text Edit,\nhere I can see Sample Data.text here.\n\n513\n00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,600\nAnd if I open that up,\n\n514\n00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,260\nsee how it's got that I'm making\na change in a non-iCloud aware program?\n\n515\n00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,280\nIt's smart enough to know that\nthat's the same file, okay?\n\n516\n00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,600\nSo, it's not actually storing\ntwo copies of the file.\n\n517\n00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,490\nThis one's actually a link.\n\n518\n00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,480\nThis is like a symbolic or\na hard link, you know?\n\n519\n00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,510\nIt's pointing to that other\nfile that's stored in there.\n\n520\n00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,640\nSo we don't try and\nkeep it straight for you, all right?\n\n521\n00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,500\nSo you need to be a little\nbit careful about that,\n\n522\n00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,330\nit can look like you're\nduplicating files or losing them.\n\n523\n00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:07,780\nBut even in a non-iCloud aware program,\nyou can still use iCloud.\n\n524\n00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,870\nSo when I fire up things\nlike Text Wrangler,\n\n525\n00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,940\nif I were just to create an all new file,\nright?\n\n526\n00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,270\nInstead of using this existing one,\nI'll create an all new file.\n\n527\n00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,640\nAnd when I go to save it,\nit's gonna default to Documents,\n\n528\n00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,740\nbecause it doesn't know about iCloud,\nright?\n\n529\n00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,340\nSo by default, it wants to save\ndocuments and that's that.\n\n530\n00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,646\nIf I save there,\nit's not gonna get synchronized to iCloud.\n\n531\n00:26:31,646 --> 00:26:32,727\nI might lose my data.\n\n532\n00:26:32,727 --> 00:26:35,280\nIf my laptop fails, I might lose my data.\n\n533\n00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,080\nAnd if you don't want to use iCloud,\nthen that's fine with me,\n\n534\n00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,430\nyou don't want to tap into that.\n\n535\n00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,440\nBut if I do, I can drop that down,\nand the iCloud drive is right there.\n\n536\n00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,550\nAnd the application doesn't\nhave to know that it's iCloud,\n\n537\n00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,870\nit just sees it as another folder.\n\n538\n00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,020\nSo this is my all new\ndocument that I'm saving.\n\n539\n00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,870\nAlright, there we go, saves to iCloud as\nif it was a regular folder on my drive.\n\n540\n00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:01,430\nAnd when I look at my iCloud drive\nback here and if I can get into it.\n\n541\n00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,250\nThere's my all due document, ready to go.\n\n542\n00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,310\nNow you do have a limit to the amount\nof storage that you have in iCloud.\n\n543\n00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,090\nIf I remember right, if you sign up for\n\n544\n00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,670\na free account today,\nI believe you get 20 gigs of storage.\n\n545\n00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:16,190\nI say I believe, because it kinda changes,\nand there's promotion sometimes.\n\n546\n00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,750\nSo like I've got 100 gigs on mine\nbecause of some promotion that was\n\n547\n00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,690\ngoing on at the time.\n\n548\n00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,480\nSo it just depends on when you sign up and\nhow you sign up,\n\n549\n00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,100\nwhat amount of storage that you get.\n\n550\n00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,690\nYou can pay to buy more storage, right?\n\n551\n00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,780\nAnd that's pretty useful because you\nwant all of your data backed up,\n\n552\n00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,990\nyou may need more.\n\n553\n00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,590\nAnd Apple's pricing is actually\npretty reasonable in that.\n\n554\n00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,670\nIf you wanna take a look at\nthat side of things, right?\n\n555\n00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,070\nYou can use the web interface for iCloud.\n\n556\n00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,180\nAnd, that's probably,\none of the coolest features of this.\n\n557\n00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,430\nLet's say that I'm in another city and\nI don't have my laptop with me and\n\n558\n00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,895\nI really wanna get to that\ndocument I was working on.\n\n559\n00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:49,005\nWell, iCloud is a fully\nenabled web interface.\n\n560\n00:27:49,005 --> 00:27:53,735\nI can fire up Safari and just last week\nthey opened up to other web browsers so\n\n561\n00:27:53,735 --> 00:27:56,245\nyou can actually do this in\nGoogle Chrome if you want now.\n\n562\n00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:59,145\nUp until a week or\ntwo ago you could only do it in Safari.\n\n563\n00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:03,085\nBut if you fire up your web browser and\n\n564\n00:28:03,085 --> 00:28:07,790\ngo to iCloud.com you'll come in here and\nyou get to a sign in screen.\n\n565\n00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,050\nYou just log in with your lab ID,\nI mean [LAUGH] your Apple ID.\n\n566\n00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,130\nSaying one thing and typing another.\n\n567\n00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:19,390\nAnd so you get logged in with that and\nyou'll get the web interface for iCloud.\n\n568\n00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:24,020\nSo I'm just gonna log in there and\nhere I am with my awesome photo and\n\n569\n00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,210\nI'll start using iCloud.\n\n570\n00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,110\nAnd what you'll see when you get in here.\n\n571\n00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,110\nAre different applications, right?\n\n572\n00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,150\nMy Mail, my Contacts, my Calendar.\n\n573\n00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,540\nThe one I'm looking for is iCloud Drive.\n\n574\n00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,450\nAnd if I go in iCloud Drive,\nI'll start to see my storage.\n\n575\n00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,390\nAnd so I see that Text Edit folder,\nright there.\n\n576\n00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,940\nI see the Sample Data file,\nI see the all new document, right?\n\n577\n00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,490\nThose things that I saved up here.\n\n578\n00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,640\nAnd I see other things too,\nautomator, previews, script editor.\n\n579\n00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,380\nThose are other programs\nthat support iCloud Drive.\n\n580\n00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,970\nYou'll see folders for\neach of the applications that you use.\n\n581\n00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,030\nAnd you can go into those and\nwork with them.\n\n582\n00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,280\nNow this sample data here,\nI made that in Text Edit.\n\n583\n00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,410\nAnd if I double click on it,\nit's just gonna display that for me.\n\n584\n00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,530\nRight?\nI can actually see the file.\n\n585\n00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:12,890\nSome documents, like if you have\nPages you can go in it and do pages.\n\n586\n00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,010\nLike word processor type documents and\nthere's actually a web based version of\n\n587\n00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,940\npages that will let you edit\nthat document and work with it.\n\n588\n00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,980\nSo some of them are very advanced.\n\n589\n00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,620\nSome of them are very simple.\n\n590\n00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,960\nThey just get displayed.\n\n591\n00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,150\nWhen I double click on that one,\nsee how it downloaded it and\n\n592\n00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:31,240\nlaunched it in Text Edit.\n\n593\n00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,040\nAnd so now I can go in and\nI can modify it.\n\n594\n00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,435\nAnd it knew to do that because it\nwas in the Text Edit subfolder so\n\n595\n00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:38,150\nit's tied to that application.\n\n596\n00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,870\nIt knew what program to run.\n\n597\n00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,430\nAnd I've got that program local so\nit fired it right up in there.\n\n598\n00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,250\nAnd if I save it,\nit's gonna save it down to iCloud.\n\n599\n00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,190\nSo, that's pretty cool stuff, really easy.\n\n600\n00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,090\nIt's like having a mobile desktop,\n\n601\n00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,250\na desktop that you don't have\nto be sitting right at to use.\n\n602\n00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,230\nSo, but, yeah.\n\n603\n00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,530\nSo that's basically iCloud.\n\n604\n00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:58,005\nAnd some good comments in the chat room.\n\n605\n00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:02,500\n[LAUGH] As with any cloud service,\nsecurity is a concern.\n\n606\n00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,690\nAnd Apple has done a pretty good\njob of keeping their system secure.\n\n607\n00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,940\nThere was the celebrity photo leak.\n\n608\n00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,710\nRight?\n\n609\n00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,010\nWhen you start tying your\nstuff to a cloud account.\n\n610\n00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,720\nSomebody could try and get in.\n\n611\n00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,350\nAnd it's important to mention on that one,\n\n612\n00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,930\nthe way the attackers were able to\naccess those people's iCloud data.\n\n613\n00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,910\nThey were able to do it because\nthose users had weak passwords.\n\n614\n00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,840\nThey had passwords that were guessable,\nthey were brute forced, and\n\n615\n00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,170\nthey got in you need to make\nsure that your Apple ID is safe.\n\n616\n00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,310\nAnd Apple has taken some precautions\nthere, they've made it stronger,\n\n617\n00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,580\nso as long as you have a good,\nstrong password on your Apple ID account,\n\n618\n00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,580\nmost of the ways that those attackers\nused to get in there are gone.\n\n619\n00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,240\nBut with any Cloud service,\nyou've got to be careful.\n\n620\n00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,050\nAnd if you're handling medical data,\nfinancial data, things like that\n\n621\n00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:49,330\nyou probably don't wanna put into a cloud\nservice without encrypting it first.\n\n622\n00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,750\nSo you might wanna look into\ndata encryption services.\n\n623\n00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,430\nThings like Open PGP are really good for\nthat for securing your data.\n\n624\n00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,500\nYou do lose some functionality.\n\n625\n00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,300\nYou can't dynamically edit\na encrypted document.\n\n626\n00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:04,280\nYou gotta decrypt it first,\nbut the security is worth it.\n\n627\n00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,980\nAll right, so that's basically it for\niCloud Drive.\n\n628\n00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,510\nIt's neat functionality and\nApple is really proud of it.\n\n629\n00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,794\nSo you can count on seeing it on the exam.\n\n630\n00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,330\nAlright.\n\n631\n00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,950\nWell looking at the clock, this is a\npretty good spot to stop and take a break,\n\n632\n00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,795\nlet's pause here, when we get back I wanna\ntake a look at some of the accessibility\n\n633\n00:31:21,795 --> 00:31:25,418\nfeatures we have in Mac OS that can\nimprove applications for people that might\n\n634\n00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:29,140\nhave some sort of disability or limitation\nwith interacting with a base OS.\n\n635\n00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,904\nSo we'll get a chance to see that\nwhen we come back, so stay tuned.\n\n636\n00:31:33,904 --> 00:31:34,409\nWe'll be backed in just a few.\n\n637\n00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:41,710\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n638\n00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,979\nSo now I'd like to move into some of the\naccessibility features that are built in\n\n639\n00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:46,850\nto Mac OS.\n\n640\n00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:50,660\nAnd I feel like I've covered these in some\nof the other shows but maybe we haven't so\n\n641\n00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,010\nwe'll just kind of go from scratch here.\n\n642\n00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,202\nMac OS is designed to be extremely\neasy to use and it's easy\n\n643\n00:31:56,202 --> 00:32:00,520\nto use through multiple interfaces,\nthrough keyboard, mouse, touchpad.\n\n644\n00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,376\nWe have visual representations\nof the desktop.\n\n645\n00:32:02,376 --> 00:32:05,115\nWe have audio bells that we\nhear when activities happened.\n\n646\n00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:08,745\nThese are all a standard design\nthat's built, basically,\n\n647\n00:32:08,745 --> 00:32:14,340\nto work as flawlessly as possible for\nthe majority of people that are out there.\n\n648\n00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,800\nHowever, it doesn't work for everyone.\n\n649\n00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,630\nDifferent people have different needs.\n\n650\n00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,330\nSome people have severe needs.\n\n651\n00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,720\nSome people have very minor needs, but\n\n652\n00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,620\nneed to change the way the basic\noperating system functions.\n\n653\n00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,220\nAnd accessibility features\nare designed to do that.\n\n654\n00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,660\nThey're designed to make\nthe technology accessible,\n\n655\n00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,302\nusable to someone who may not\notherwise be able to do that.\n\n656\n00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,340\nRight.\nWhether that be a visual impairment or\n\n657\n00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,810\nauditory impairment, maybe it's\nsomebody just like me with bad vision.\n\n658\n00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:43,030\nNot clinically blind or anything, but\nmy eyes are not as good as they should be.\n\n659\n00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:46,355\nSo those types of things make\na computer harder to use.\n\n660\n00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:50,170\nAnd so there's various features that\nare built into MAC OS that are designed to\n\n661\n00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:50,700\nhelp with that.\n\n662\n00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,200\nTo help get you in there and\nusing that computer,\n\n663\n00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,735\nin spite of anything else that might\nstop you from doing it normally.\n\n664\n00:32:55,735 --> 00:32:56,590\nRight.\n\n665\n00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,900\nThese are all tucked away under\nthe accessibility features.\n\n666\n00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,390\nI just want to point out a couple of\nthem that can turn out on the exam.\n\n667\n00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,760\nSo if you go in the System Preferences.\n\n668\n00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,270\nYou'll see an icon down there for\n\n669\n00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:10,680\nAccessibility, it's just a little\nwhite stick man on a blue circle.\n\n670\n00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,455\nAnd that'ill show you some of\nthe different accessibility features that\n\n671\n00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:15,050\nare part of Mac OS.\n\n672\n00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,540\nSome of the easy ones to deal with\nthe things like the Display enhancements.\n\n673\n00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,610\nInverting colors, using grayscale, and\n\n674\n00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,690\nfeatures like this are designed to\nhelp people with visual impairment.\n\n675\n00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:30,120\nIf you have a hard time seeing then\ndata rendered on the screen can be\n\n676\n00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,740\nreally challenging,\nespecially with Apple's design spec.\n\n677\n00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,240\nRight?\n\n678\n00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,770\nApple makes some good stuff, but on the\ndesign side they make some decisions that\n\n679\n00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,590\nare really frustrating sometimes.\n\n680\n00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,440\nLike it's really popular for them to\ndo grey text on a white background.\n\n681\n00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,480\nI hate that, the light grey,\nit's so hard to read.\n\n682\n00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,725\nOr even like right here,\nthe black text on a grey background.\n\n683\n00:33:50,725 --> 00:33:53,510\nIt'll be so much easier to\nread if it were high contrast,\n\n684\n00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,030\nblack text on a white background.\n\n685\n00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,850\nBut it's not as pretty, right?\n\n686\n00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,990\nWe've got to reach a certain aesthetic,\nand for most people that's fine.\n\n687\n00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,680\nBut if you have a visual impairment,\nthat can be frustrating.\n\n688\n00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,140\nSo you can do things like\ninverting colors, and\n\n689\n00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,630\nsee how it becomes much more stark now.\n\n690\n00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,910\nThis is a high-contrast view.\n\n691\n00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,390\nThings have been reversed, and\nnow they're much more sharp.\n\n692\n00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:15,500\nI do have white text on\nthat black background.\n\n693\n00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,139\nOr we can do grayscale,\nwhere everything goes black and white.\n\n694\n00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:18,985\nRight.\nIf you're,\n\n695\n00:34:18,985 --> 00:34:20,776\nnot necessarily typical color blind.\n\n696\n00:34:20,776 --> 00:34:24,414\nBut certain types of color blindness\ncan make it where it's difficult to\n\n697\n00:34:24,414 --> 00:34:28,545\ndifferentiate similar colors on the screen\nand this helps to break things apart.\n\n698\n00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:29,630\nRight.\n\n699\n00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,260\nWe've got differentiate without color,\n\n700\n00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,900\nwhich is supposed to\nachieve the same thing.\n\n701\n00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,550\nFor me, I don't actually notice\nany visual difference there.\n\n702\n00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,580\nIncrease contrast, if we just want\nto make it a little bit more stark.\n\n703\n00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,400\nAnd you'll see that was really\na subtle change to the screen design\n\n704\n00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,550\nto help improve that accessibility.\n\n705\n00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:49,180\nLike if you watch my menu up here, see\nhow it's black text on a gray background?\n\n706\n00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:53,648\nAnd when I hit increase contrast now\nit's black text on a white background.\n\n707\n00:34:53,648 --> 00:34:55,270\nMore visible.\n\n708\n00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,010\nRight.\n\n709\n00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,630\nAnd you can do things like reducing\nthe transparencies that are used.\n\n710\n00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,720\nSome things are intentionally\nsee through in the UI.\n\n711\n00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,010\nWe can start to minimize that or\nchange it.\n\n712\n00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,860\nSo a lot of different options\nright there on the Display side.\n\n713\n00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,650\nYou've also got this Zoom tool,\nto be able to zoom in on\n\n714\n00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,690\nparts of the screen which is\nhelpful when you've got small text.\n\n715\n00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:17,750\nIf I wanted to zoom in to show something\nlike this, I could turn on the Zoom tool.\n\n716\n00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,220\nAnd we've got keyboard shortcuts for\n\n717\n00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,590\nthat that we can use to zoom in and\ncapture that.\n\n718\n00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:25,420\nYou've also got scroll gestures that\nyou can use, like on your touchpad,\n\n719\n00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,560\nyour swipes and\nother motions you can customize there.\n\n720\n00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,243\nSo couple of interesting ones we can do,\nand\n\n721\n00:35:31,243 --> 00:35:33,980\nthe keyboard shortcuts are designed\nto make that somewhat easy to use.\n\n722\n00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,662\nThe one they call out on the exam though,\nis this technology right here.\n\n723\n00:35:39,662 --> 00:35:41,270\nVoiceOver.\n\n724\n00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,170\nRight.\n\n725\n00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:46,100\nIf your visual impairment is such\nthat you can't see the screen.\n\n726\n00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,570\nIt doesn't matter what color it is,\nor whether it's zoomed in.\n\n727\n00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,800\nYou're just not able to see it.\n\n728\n00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,252\nWell, none of these\nfeatures are gonna help us.\n\n729\n00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:56,680\nWhat voiceover does is it takes\nthe visual information and\n\n730\n00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,160\nit turns it into auditory information.\n\n731\n00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,840\nSo this is text to speech.\n\n732\n00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,115\nIt takes the text on the screen and\nit reads it out loud in a computer voice.\n\n733\n00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:08,486\nVoiceover's been around in MAC OS for\nquite some time.\n\n734\n00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:13,320\nSo it's not a new technology and\nit's designed to help us to be able to\n\n735\n00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,830\nbasically deal with a machine when we\nmight not be able to read the text.\n\n736\n00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,870\nEnabling it is really easy.\n\n737\n00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,540\nWe just click a little check mark on it.\n\n738\n00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,940\n>> VoiceOver.\n\n739\n00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,242\n>> And there it goes.\n\n740\n00:36:22,242 --> 00:36:25,360\n>> VoiceOver speaks descriptions\nof items on the screen and\n\n741\n00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,390\ncan be used to control the computer\nusing only your keyboard.\n\n742\n00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:32,092\nIf you already know how to use VoiceOver,\npress the V key now.\n\n743\n00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:33,752\n>> I'm not\n>> VoiceOver on System Preferences,\n\n744\n00:36:33,752 --> 00:36:34,787\nAccessibility, window,\nAccessibility features, table, VoiceOver,\n\n745\n00:36:34,787 --> 00:36:35,445\nVoiceOver image selected\nhas keyboard focus.\n\n746\n00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:43,790\n>> [LAUGH] We'll get it\nin just a minute here.\n\n747\n00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,520\nThere we go.\n\n748\n00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,177\nAll right, now once voiceover is on,\nas Windows pop up on my screen.\n\n749\n00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:49,839\n>> You are currently on a table.\n\n750\n00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,186\nTo enter this table,\npress Control-Option-Shift-Down Arrow.\n\n751\n00:36:51,186 --> 00:36:52,190\nIt's gonna start reading what's going on.\n\n752\n00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:55,590\nNow if you hear what it's doing right\nthere, it's telling me I'm on a table.\n\n753\n00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,090\nRight.\n\n754\n00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,540\nWhat tables it talking about?\n\n755\n00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,450\nIt's talking about this stuff over here.\n\n756\n00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,480\nRight.\nDisplay, Zoom, VoiceOver, that's my table.\n\n757\n00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,270\nAnd so its got a bunch of different items\nin there and it's giving me options for\n\n758\n00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,520\nhow to navigate that.\n\n759\n00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,540\nSee how it said to enter this table\npress Control-Option-Shift-Down Arrow.\n\n760\n00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,770\nThat is not something\nI would ever remember.\n\n761\n00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,590\nBut they say it so I know what to press.\n\n762\n00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,880\nI can hit control,\noption Shift down arrow.\n\n763\n00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,030\n>> Interact with Accessibility\nfeatures table, row 4 of 14 selected.\n\n764\n00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,230\n>> And now I'm in the table.\n\n765\n00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,660\nAnd it's telling me I'm in row 4,\nwhich didn't help me out too much.\n\n766\n00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,620\nNormally, it'll actually say what\nthe name of that entity was.\n\n767\n00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,411\n>> You are currently on a cell 2 items,\ninside of a table.\n\n768\n00:37:33,411 --> 00:37:37,229\nTo navigate the cells within this

navigation information.\n\n771\n00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,851\nWhere I can go, what I can do from here.\n\n772\n00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:44,933\nI can go and start to check option.\n\n773\n00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:48,306\nThis feature is nice because you can\nturn on and turn it off really easy.\n\n774\n00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:50,436\nIt was the Command F5.\n\n775\n00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:51,644\n>> VoiceOver Off.\n\n776\n00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,641\n>> It was that turns it on and off.\n\n777\n00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:57,268\nAnd so once I've got that kind of set up,\nI can go wherever I want.\n\n778\n00:37:57,268 --> 00:38:01,412\nAnd if I have a hard time reading\nsomething, I can hit the Command F5 and\n\n779\n00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:04,635\nit'll start to read that back to me,\nall right?\n\n780\n00:38:04,635 --> 00:38:07,470\nVoiceOver really convenient for\ndoing that.\n\n781\n00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,250\nYou might've noticed that voice\ndidn't sound all that great, right?\n\n782\n00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,530\nThat does happen.\n\n783\n00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,730\nThe built in voices, they try and\ndo a decent job of it, but\n\n784\n00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,140\nthey're not necessarily the greatest.\n\n785\n00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,840\nAnd so we'll see where we can change\nsome of those a little bit later.\n\n786\n00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,462\nI'll show you some of the other\nvoices that are built into the system\n\n787\n00:38:21,462 --> 00:38:22,107\nthat we can use.\n\n788\n00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:25,435\nNotice we've got this\nOpen VoiceOver Training.\n\n789\n00:38:25,435 --> 00:38:25,980\n>> VoiceOver Quick Start.\n\n790\n00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,728\n>> We can go into this and\nlet me just silent her a little quick.\n\n791\n00:38:29,728 --> 00:38:32,306\nIt gives us a whole wizard\nthat we can walkthrough and\n\n792\n00:38:32,306 --> 00:38:33,721\nlearn how to use VoiceOver.\n\n793\n00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:36,474\nIt's actually really powerful software.\n\n794\n00:38:36,474 --> 00:38:40,232\nIt can do all sort of crazy things\nif you take the time to learn it.\n\n795\n00:38:40,232 --> 00:38:43,592\nIf you don't have a visual impairment\nyou might look at this and say man,\n\n796\n00:38:43,592 --> 00:38:44,760\nthat's really kludgy.\n\n797\n00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,250\nI don't wanna navigate this way.\n\n798\n00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,220\nBut if this is the tool you have to use to\nget by, you can learn it and become very,\n\n799\n00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,400\nvery efficient with it.\n\n800\n00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,660\nIt's really good.\n\n801\n00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,910\nThere's third party utilities out there\nthat work too, but this one it's free,\n\n802\n00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,685\nit's built in the OS and\nit's very effective.\n\n803\n00:38:58,685 --> 00:39:00,372\nRight.\n\n804\n00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:02,680\nI'm gonna quit out of that for right now.\n\n805\n00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,930\nYou'll also see the VoiceOver utility\nright here, and we can click on that.\n\n806\n00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,090\nAnd it will take us into some\nadditional settings for VoiceOver.\n\n807\n00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,440\nAnd here's where we can do things like\ntesting VoiceOver, and seeing whether or\n\n808\n00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,610\nnot it's working the way\nthat we'd want it to.\n\n809\n00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,250\nWe can set up our speech or\nother utilities,\n\n810\n00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,250\nand there's a lot of neat things in here.\n\n811\n00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:22,470\nThe one I wanna point out the most,\nthough, is this guy right down here.\n\n812\n00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,480\nWe can set up a connection for\na Braille keyboard.\n\n813\n00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,580\nIf you have a Braille keyboard which is\nnot a keyboard in the traditional sense\n\n814\n00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,380\nlike you might be thinking of keys.\n\n815\n00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,070\nA Braille keyboard's actually\nit's like a flat board and\n\n816\n00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,980\nthe bumps are able to appear on that\nto represent the letters and so on.\n\n817\n00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,170\nYou can have it connected to that,\ninstead of rendering spoken speech,\n\n818\n00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,360\nit can render the braille\nversion of that too.\n\n819\n00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,750\nSo another option to be able to use\nthe computer if you're visually impaired.\n\n820\n00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,930\nAll right, now VoiceOver is designed for\ntext to speech.\n\n821\n00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:57,210\nIt takes the text on your screen,\nand it makes it into speech.\n\n822\n00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:01,060\nBut one of the big things we're\nhearing about today is speech to text,\n\n823\n00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,691\nwhere it takes what you say and\n\n824\n00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:07,275\nconverts that into text on the screen or\nconverts it into commands on the computer.\n\n825\n00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:10,655\nSo that you can control\nthe computer without touching it.\n\n826\n00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:14,120\nNow, it's a convenience that\na lot of us use these days.\n\n827\n00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,550\nLike talking to Siri on your phone,\nwhich, I think I've yet\n\n828\n00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:20,980\nto get a right answer out of Siri so\nI must be asking the wrong questions.\n\n829\n00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,340\nSo it's a tool that they\nprovide as a convenience.\n\n830\n00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,960\nBut it actually originated from\npeople who couldn't use the keyboard.\n\n831\n00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,840\nIf you have Parkinson's disease or\nif you have motor skills issues.\n\n832\n00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,960\nMultiple sclerosis things like that.\n\n833\n00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,490\nThat can impact your ability\nto even use a keyboard.\n\n834\n00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,490\nWell are you out of luck?\n\n835\n00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,600\nCan you not use a computer?\n\n836\n00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,950\nEvery computer has a keyboard right?\n\n837\n00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:46,800\nEven an iPad has an onscreen keyboard\nwell if you can do speech-to-text,\n\n838\n00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,960\nyou can talk and command the computer and\nstill maintain use of it.\n\n839\n00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,110\nAnd that technology has come a long way,\nmostly because it's not\n\n840\n00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:59,050\njust stuck in accessibility anymore,\nnow it's a general purpose utility.\n\n841\n00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:03,890\nIt's kind of a sad state of affairs\nin the world of accessibility, that\n\n842\n00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:09,130\nthe people who benefit most from these\ntools make up a very small percentage\n\n843\n00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:13,000\nof the population and as a result, they\ndon't get the representation they need.\n\n844\n00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,360\nThey don't get the tools they\nneed to be succesful and so\n\n845\n00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,560\nwe end up with utilities that are,\nkind of, half baked, all right?\n\n846\n00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,270\nNotice that the voice-over utility, for\n\n847\n00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,980\nexample, didn't even read that I was\non the menu item for voice-over.\n\n848\n00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,910\nYou'd think they would have caught that.\n\n849\n00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,760\nBut the development dollars aren't\nin it like it should be, but\n\n850\n00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,980\nnow that speech-to-text is getting\ngeneral acceptance, we're starting to see\n\n851\n00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,360\nmore development dollars put into it and\nit's becoming more and more powerful.\n\n852\n00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,260\nYou end up with things like Siri, that as\nyou know, is very effective, anybody can\n\n853\n00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,420\ntalk to it in plain English and it's\nable to do a lot of different things, so\n\n854\n00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,890\nthere's a lot of neat stuff that\nare coming out along that route.\n\n855\n00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,170\nNow, in Accessibility,\nI see Voiceover, and\n\n856\n00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:54,560\nthat's text-to-speech, if I go back\nout to my main system preferences,\n\n857\n00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,930\nI'll see a completely system preference\ncalled Dictation and Speech, right?\n\n858\n00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,340\nThis is speech-to-text,\nthe other way around.\n\n859\n00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,250\nThis is me talking to the computer\nthey've moved it out of Accessibility and\n\n860\n00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,900\nout here, because it's designed for\neveryone now.\n\n861\n00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,550\nSo they've kind of moved that location.\n\n862\n00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,890\nIf you go into that Dictation and\n\n863\n00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,950\nSpeech, you'll see where you can\ncome in here and configure it.\n\n864\n00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,470\nIt even says, text to speech right there.\n\n865\n00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,920\nThat's basically what we're doing.\n\n866\n00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,850\nNotice my internal microphone\nis bobbing up and down.\n\n867\n00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:25,780\nThe microphone on my laptop is on and\npicking up my voice.\n\n868\n00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,270\nRight?\n\n869\n00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:31,760\nI can turn Dictation on, and now I can use\n\n870\n00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,530\nthis system to talk to the computer, and\nit'll start to type what I'm saying.\n\n871\n00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,380\nOr at least it'll try to, right?\n\n872\n00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,690\n[LAUGH] My My speech mannerisms are such\nthat I don't have a great lot of\n\n873\n00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,690\nluck with these things but\nif I turn it on it's ready to go.\n\n874\n00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,310\nYou'll see what it's got is a little\nshortcut that we can use here.\n\n875\n00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:52,890\nIt says press the function key twice,\nwhen you've got dictation turned on\n\n876\n00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,200\nIt doesn't want to listen\nto you all the time.\n\n877\n00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,820\nIt doesn't want your microphone on all the\ntime eavesdropping on your conversations.\n\n878\n00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,690\nSo instead, it sets up a function key.\n\n879\n00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:05,890\nAnd with the function key,\nyou hit whatever that key is, and\n\n880\n00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,140\nthen it starts listening.\n\n881\n00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,590\nAnd you hit that key and\nit stops listening.\n\n882\n00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:12,030\nThe default is,\npress the function key twice.\n\n883\n00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,100\nOn my keyboard,\nthere's actually a key labeled FN.\n\n884\n00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,770\nYou can drop that down and\nchose other things like, right command or\n\n885\n00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:22,620\nleft command key,tap it twice and\nthat starts it.\n\n886\n00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,690\nOr you can even go in to customize and\n\n887\n00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:29,620\nyou can chose any key combination\nyou want to serve as that hot key.\n\n888\n00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:34,010\nSo, you've gotta a couple of different\noptions for how you wanna go with that.\n\n889\n00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,740\nI might want to set to my left arrow or\nwhatever and you can do that.\n\n890\n00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,150\nI'm gonna set mine back to\nthe default of the function key.\n\n891\n00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,780\nRight.\n\n892\n00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:45,850\nOnce that's set, I can double tap that\nFN key and it'll start my dictation.\n\n893\n00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:46,400\nRight.\n\n894\n00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,520\nBut notice this little option right here,\nUse Enhanced Dictation.\n\n895\n00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,130\nRight.\nIt says allows offline use and\n\n896\n00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,710\ncontinuous dictation with live feedback.\n\n897\n00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,670\nWhat does that mean?\n\n898\n00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:01,050\nWell, the way dictation works by default,\nyou tap that FN key twice,\n\n899\n00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,060\nyou say something to the computer.\n\n900\n00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:08,280\nIt takes what you said, uploads it to\nApple's servers, and Apple's servers\n\n901\n00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,890\ninterpret what you said, and then send\ninformation back down saying what to do.\n\n902\n00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,980\nYour computer isn't\nactually doing the logic.\n\n903\n00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:20,160\nYou're relying on Apple's server, so\nif you're offline, it doesn't work.\n\n904\n00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,250\nSo that's one reason we\nmight not want that.\n\n905\n00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,610\nAnd then two, everything we say\nis being sent off to Apple.\n\n906\n00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:25,920\nWe might not want that either.\n\n907\n00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,630\nRight.\n\n908\n00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,950\nSo instead we can choose\nto use enhanced dictation.\n\n909\n00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,200\nWhere our own computer\ndoes the translation.\n\n910\n00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:39,280\nIf you turn that on, it has to download\nabout 1.2 gigabytes of audio data for\n\n911\n00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,820\nbasically hashing and\ndeciphering your commands so\n\n912\n00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,470\nwhen I check that off,\nit's gonna have to go and download it.\n\n913\n00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,870\nNow, I already downloaded it on\nmy laptop before the show so\n\n914\n00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,030\nwe wouldn't have to wait for it.\n\n915\n00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:51,890\nBut basically you'll see a little message\nappear right here that says downloading\n\n916\n00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,470\nvoice data please wait.\n\n917\n00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:56,120\nAnd you can do other things on your\ncomputer while it's downloading that,\n\n918\n00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,950\nit shouldn't take too terribly long.\n\n919\n00:44:57,950 --> 00:44:59,840\nBut once it's done,\n\n920\n00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,580\nnow I'll be able to do voice dictation\nright here on my own system.\n\n921\n00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,560\nAll right.\n\n922\n00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,220\nThe other tab up top\nhere is text to speech.\n\n923\n00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,940\nWe were in text to speech a moment ago in\nthe accessibility side, but I wanted us to\n\n924\n00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,840\ncome in here, because here's where you\ncan start to see some of the voices.\n\n925\n00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,780\nThis Alex voice is the default for\nme right now if I play that.\n\n926\n00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:24,040\n>> Most people recognize me by my voice\n>> It's a fairly robotic voice.\n\n927\n00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,720\nIt's not necessarily the greatest.\n\n928\n00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,760\nBut you'll see there's other ones that\nwe can choose from like Bruce and Fred.\n\n929\n00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,408\n>> Oh sure like the inside\nof this fancy computer.\n\n930\n00:45:31,408 --> 00:45:32,378\n>> That's pretty bad.\n\n931\n00:45:32,378 --> 00:45:34,210\nLet's try one of these other ones.\n\n932\n00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:36,930\n>> Sure like the inside\nthis fancy computer.\n\n933\n00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,130\n>> Yeah these are all pretty rough\n>> The nice thing though,\n\n934\n00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:43,260\nis with these voices, these are the free\nones that come from Apple, there\n\n935\n00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,950\nare companies out there that specialize\nin making voices that are smooth and\n\n936\n00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:50,230\nactually sound reasonably normal.\n\n937\n00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:53,580\nIt's not perfect, nobody's got\na perfect voice reproduction yet, but\n\n938\n00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:58,300\nyou can go into Customize, and you can\nactually load in third party voices.\n\n939\n00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,790\nYou'll see that I've actually got\nmore here that I can download from\n\n940\n00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,400\nApple if I wanted to.\n\n941\n00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,640\n>> And there's other nationalities and\nso on.\n\n942\n00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,603\nSome of them are silly, like the pipe\norgan, so they aren't actually voices,\n\n943\n00:46:07,603 --> 00:46:09,563\nbut a lot of these are, and\nwe can get them loaded in.\n\n944\n00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:16,763\nAll right, and then you'll see where you\ncan adjust the speed announce when alerts\n\n945\n00:46:16,763 --> 00:46:18,490\nare displayed, that's a useful one.\n\n946\n00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,850\nIf you get an email or notification,\nit'll actually say it out loud.\n\n947\n00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:23,270\nNotification from blah, blah, blah.\n\n948\n00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:24,870\nIt'll actually state that.\n\n949\n00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:28,100\nWe can speak selected text\nwhen a key is pressed.\n\n950\n00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,070\nWe can highlight text and\nhit a shortcut key and\n\n951\n00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:33,270\nit'll actually read that text out for\nus and you can set what that is.\n\n952\n00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:36,060\nThe default is Option+Esc and\nit'll read that text out.\n\n953\n00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,540\nAnd you'll see where we can see where you\ncan set the clock to read out animations\n\n954\n00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,340\nand you can jump into voiceover.\n\n955\n00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,641\nThis is all built on top of voiceover,\n\n956\n00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:45,390\nbuilt on top of that\naccessibility setting, and so\n\n957\n00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,950\nit's gonna link to you\nright back into that.\n\n958\n00:46:49,422 --> 00:46:52,350\nAll right, well let's take\na look at that dictation piece.\n\n959\n00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,300\nI've got it turned on,\nlet's see it in action, all right?\n\n960\n00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,080\nIf I were to fire up something like pages.\n\n961\n00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,400\nPages is a word processor from Apple,\nso I'll just fire that up.\n\n962\n00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,090\nAnd I can start writing\nmy application in here or\n\n963\n00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:09,770\nwhatever it is that I'm what\nI'm trying to write up today.\n\n964\n00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:14,610\nSo maybe these are Don's show notes and\nwe're covering voiceover.\n\n965\n00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:21,840\nAnd we'll just say most voiceover\nvoices are fairly robotic.\n\n966\n00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,410\nAll right, so\nI'm writing my document, okay?\n\n967\n00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,420\nNow as I write my document.\n\n968\n00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,700\nI can issue commands.\n\n969\n00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,980\nI can do straight up dictation to\nthe system, and start talking and\n\n970\n00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,960\nit will type it.\n\n971\n00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,860\nOr I can issue commands.\n\n972\n00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,500\nAnd the commands are really\nthe coolest part.\n\n973\n00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,860\nLet's go full screen on this for\njust a moment.\n\n974\n00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,710\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to double tap my FN key.\n\n975\n00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:44,950\nAnd when I do that at the bottom right\nof my screen there's a microphone that\n\n976\n00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:47,300\nappears and it hears me talking.\n\n977\n00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,380\nAnd see what it's doing?\n\n978\n00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,420\nIt's typing the words that I'm saying.\n\n979\n00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:54,900\nNow I'm just going to hit FN\ntwice again to turn it off.\n\n980\n00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,760\nSo it's turning off now.\n\n981\n00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,179\nAnd so it said at the bottom right my\nscreen is a microphone that appears and\n\n982\n00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:01,472\nit hears me talking.\n\n983\n00:48:01,472 --> 00:48:03,653\nI was talking a little bit too fast.\n\n984\n00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:05,592\nAnd so it lost some words as it went,\n\n985\n00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:09,140\nbut it did a pretty decent job\nof getting what I was saying.\n\n986\n00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:12,080\nI probably needed to talk a little\nslower to make sure that it actually got\n\n987\n00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:12,750\neverything in there.\n\n988\n00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,350\nBut the other thing that\nappeared was a command list.\n\n989\n00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,580\nNow that command list\ndoesn't show up by default.\n\n990\n00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,890\nI must have brought that up before,\nso let me show you how that works.\n\n991\n00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,210\nLet's go full screen again.\n\n992\n00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,450\nHide Commands.\n\n993\n00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:29,920\nWait, it's thinking.\n\n994\n00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,790\nSo the command list though,\nit's kind of nice.\n\n995\n00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:36,150\nIt gives you a list of all the voice\ncommands you can issue to the system.\n\n996\n00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:40,070\nAnd, let me just get out of this.\n\n997\n00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,278\nIt seems to be stuck.\n\n998\n00:48:41,278 --> 00:48:43,536\n[SOUND] There we go.\n\n999\n00:48:43,536 --> 00:48:44,974\nHide Commands.\n\n1000\n00:48:47,597 --> 00:48:49,465\nShow commands.\n\n1001\n00:48:49,465 --> 00:48:51,420\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n1002\n00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,400\nSee how it popped that right up?\n\n1003\n00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,590\nIt's debating whether it should issue\nthe command or actually listen to me.\n\n1004\n00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:59,660\nSo it popped up a little bit right\nthere that saw that was dealing with\n\n1005\n00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,560\nthat command.\n\n1006\n00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,174\nLet me just go a little more simple here.\n\n1007\n00:49:05,868 --> 00:49:07,953\nSelect all.\n\n1008\n00:49:07,953 --> 00:49:09,869\nBold this.\n\n1009\n00:49:09,869 --> 00:49:12,519\nItalicize this.\n\n1010\n00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:17,610\nThere we go.\n\n1011\n00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:20,230\nI'm gonna turn it off cause otherwise\nit's gonna keep listening to me.\n\n1012\n00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:23,670\nSo you guys saw right there where I\nwas able to issue commands to it, and\n\n1013\n00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,980\nthat command list tells me all\nthe different commands that I can issue.\n\n1014\n00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,120\nAnd so you say show commands to get that\nlist to come up if it's not there already.\n\n1015\n00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,126\nOr you can say hide commands to get\nrid of it although neither of those\n\n1016\n00:49:34,126 --> 00:49:34,856\nworked for me.\n\n1017\n00:49:34,856 --> 00:49:40,000\nYou'll see where I told it select all and\nI highlighted everything that I did and\n\n1018\n00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,420\nbold this, made it all bold or\nitalicize this.\n\n1019\n00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:47,490\nYou can say move right, move left to have\nit move the cursor to different places.\n\n1020\n00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:50,900\nYou can completely manage\nthis with your voice.\n\n1021\n00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,790\nAnd it works pretty well.\n\n1022\n00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:55,850\nIt does a pretty good job for being a\ncompletely free product built into the OS.\n\n1023\n00:49:55,850 --> 00:50:00,020\nThere's a lot of expensive software\nout there like Dragon Dictation,\n\n1024\n00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,940\nwhich does a great job but\ncosts a lot of money.\n\n1025\n00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,610\nThis is baked into the OS.\n\n1026\n00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:05,980\nSo very powerful stuff.\n\n1027\n00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,030\nAnd Apple's developed this\nkind of in line with Siri, so\n\n1028\n00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,500\nthey have a vested interest in\nmaking it as good as possible.\n\n1029\n00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:16,730\nSo with each version of Mac OS that comes\nout the feature gets better and better.\n\n1030\n00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,760\nAnd you probably noticed when it made that\nmicrophone noise, that's the same noise\n\n1031\n00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,830\nfrom the cellphone, from your iPad or\niPhone when Siri kicks in.\n\n1032\n00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:26,050\nThe only difference is we don't\nactually have Siri logic on this one.\n\n1033\n00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:29,250\nYou can't ask it what movies\nare showing in my city.\n\n1034\n00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,990\nIt'll just type that out, right?\n\n1035\n00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:35,150\nIt is listening for those commands though,\nwaiting to pick those up.\n\n1036\n00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:36,700\nBut it's not running all the time.\n\n1037\n00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,715\nIf I say select all.\n\n1038\n00:50:40,756 --> 00:50:41,680\nIt's not running.\n\n1039\n00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,725\nI've got to tell it to run,\nI've got to tap those FN keys.\n\n1040\n00:50:44,725 --> 00:50:47,156\n[SOUND] Select all.\n\n1041\n00:50:49,234 --> 00:50:50,080\nAnd there it goes.\n\n1042\n00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,850\nRight?\nSo you control what it listens.\n\n1043\n00:50:53,632 --> 00:50:56,770\nAll right just remember for the exam,\nenhanced dictation is not turned on by\n\n1044\n00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,270\ndefault you gotta turn it on, and it will\ndownload one point two gigs of data.\n\n1045\n00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:03,620\nAnd that is what allows us to\ndo the off line dictation.\n\n1046\n00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,450\nWithout that you are relying\non Apple servers and\n\n1047\n00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:09,076\nif you don't have a great internet\nconnection it could be really slow and\n\n1048\n00:51:09,076 --> 00:51:11,030\nfrustrating.\n\n1049\n00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:12,030\nAll right, let's see.\n\n1050\n00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:14,230\nIs there anything else I\nwanna mention in there?\n\n1051\n00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:17,766\nLet's see.\nThe advanced commands we saw,\n\n1052\n00:51:17,766 --> 00:51:18,980\nvoice over, yeah.\n\n1053\n00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,830\nYeah, that's basically it for\naccessibility options.\n\n1054\n00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:22,910\nThere's a lot of stuff in there.\n\n1055\n00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:23,680\nMess around with them.\n\n1056\n00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,420\nYou'll see the accessibility\noptions are really powerful, and\n\n1057\n00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,820\nthey're just great utilities.\n\n1058\n00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,202\nThey help a lot of people be able to\nuse a computer that otherwise might not\n\n1059\n00:51:31,202 --> 00:51:31,763\nbe able to.\n\n1060\n00:51:33,412 --> 00:51:36,420\nAll right, well that's about it for\nvoice over.\n\n1061\n00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,640\nLet's stop here and take a break.\n\n1062\n00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,210\nI've got a lot more to\ntalk about this episode.\n\n1063\n00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:43,160\nWhen we get back, I wanna talk about\n32-bit and 64-bit applications.\n\n1064\n00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,010\nI mentioned that when we\nwere talking about Java.\n\n1065\n00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,170\nI wanna double back and\n\n1066\n00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,170\ncover that so everybody has a good\nunderstanding of what that's all about.\n\n1067\n00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:51,230\nSo stay tuned.\n\n1068\n00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,858\nI'll be back in just a moment.\n\n1069\n00:51:53,858 --> 00:52:00,011\n[SOUND]\nAll right.\n\n1070\n00:52:00,011 --> 00:52:01,380\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n1071\n00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,070\nSo at the beginning of the episode\nwhen we were installing Java,\n\n1072\n00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:08,580\nI called out how Java was a 64-bit\napplication, or framework in that case.\n\n1073\n00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,850\nWhat was I talking about?\n\n1074\n00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,060\nWhat is 64-bit?\n\n1075\n00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:16,890\nWell Yosemite is a 64-bit\noperating system.\n\n1076\n00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:24,271\nAnd what that means is that it's able to\naddress more memory than non 64-bit OSs.\n\n1077\n00:52:24,271 --> 00:52:29,730\nFor the longest time,\nMac OS has been a 32-bit operating system.\n\n1078\n00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:34,510\nAnd what that meant is that any time a\nprogram needed to reach out to memory, and\n\n1079\n00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:39,050\nall programs do that, all of your running\nprograms store their running data in RAM.\n\n1080\n00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:41,190\nAnd so\nwhen a program would reach out to RAM,\n\n1081\n00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:44,910\nit had to reach out to particular spots\nin the RAM to where it stored its data.\n\n1082\n00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,560\nSo think of it as like a pirate map.\n\n1083\n00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,250\nSo if you bury your treasure out\nthere on some [LAUGH] island,\n\n1084\n00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,470\nhow do you find that\ntreasure a year from now?\n\n1085\n00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,910\nYou have a map and it's got little dots\nand a big x right where the treasure is.\n\n1086\n00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:59,290\nWell, your programs\nare basically doing that.\n\n1087\n00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:00,245\nYour programs are pirates.\n\n1088\n00:53:00,245 --> 00:53:04,350\n[LAUGH] And they store their golden RAM\nand then later on they say all right,\n\n1089\n00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:05,530\nI need to go back and get that gold.\n\n1090\n00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,740\nWhere is it?\nAnd they have to have a map to get there.\n\n1091\n00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,720\nAnd that map was simply an address number.\n\n1092\n00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,880\nIt was a number that identified\nwhere in the memory their data was.\n\n1093\n00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,310\nAnd so\nway back in the early days of computing,\n\n1094\n00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,330\nthey came up with this\nidea of having a number.\n\n1095\n00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,210\nAnd as time went on people got more and\nmore memory, and\n\n1096\n00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:25,570\nthey had to pick a number that was\nbig enough to account for memory.\n\n1097\n00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:29,993\nWell most systems, back in the 90s,\nswitched to a 32-bit number.\n\n1098\n00:53:29,993 --> 00:53:33,466\nA 32-bit, that means 32 binary bits,\n1s and 0s.\n\n1099\n00:53:33,466 --> 00:53:38,280\nWith a 32-bit number,\nyou can write any number from 0\n\n1100\n00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,000\nall the way through around 4.3 billion.\n\n1101\n00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:50,010\nThat meant if your computer had 2 gigs of\nRAM, which is around 2 billion bytes of\n\n1102\n00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:55,070\nRAM, then you could have a memory address\nthat referenced all of those bytes of RAM.\n\n1103\n00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,810\nIt wasn't that big of a deal.\n\n1104\n00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:01,200\nBut as we started getting more and more\nmemory in our computer, we get a problem.\n\n1105\n00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,200\nWhen people started getting 4\nGB of memory in their computer,\n\n1106\n00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,780\ndevelopers realized this\nwas gonna be an issue.\n\n1107\n00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:11,250\nThey said, well, we only use a 32-bit\nnumber to reference that memory.\n\n1108\n00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,460\nWhat if somebody gets\nmore than 4 GB of memory?\n\n1109\n00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,140\nNow we're out of luck.\n\n1110\n00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,770\nWell, you're not completely out of luck.\n\n1111\n00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,920\nApple stepped in and did some neat\nthings with 32-bit technologies.\n\n1112\n00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,920\nThey made it where your desktop could\nrecognize more than 4 gigs of RAM, but\n\n1113\n00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,140\neach of your programs were\nlimited to 4 gigs of RAM each.\n\n1114\n00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:36,340\nSo if I had 16 gigs of RAM in my computer,\nno one program could use all 16 gigs.\n\n1115\n00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:40,315\nOne program could use 4 gigs,\nanother program could use 4 gigs,\n\n1116\n00:54:40,315 --> 00:54:42,180\na third program could use 4 gigs, right?\n\n1117\n00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:47,170\nNow I'm using 12 gigs of RAM, but no one\nprogram could use more than 4 gigs of RAM.\n\n1118\n00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:49,310\nWell, that wasn't a big deal in the 90s.\n\n1119\n00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:52,200\nHaving a gigabyte of RAM\nin the '90s was unheard of.\n\n1120\n00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,250\nBut in today's world where I may be\nrunning a virtual machine with 8\n\n1121\n00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,390\ngigs of RAM assigned to it alone.\n\n1122\n00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:58,430\nIt happens all the time.\n\n1123\n00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:02,220\nWe have applications that consume\nmore memory than we used to.\n\n1124\n00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,550\nSo they had to move to a bigger number.\n\n1125\n00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:10,148\nThe 32-bit number wasn't big enough,\nso they moved up to a 64-bit number.\n\n1126\n00:55:10,148 --> 00:55:13,428\nBy having 64-bit memory addressing,\n\n1127\n00:55:13,428 --> 00:55:18,499\none application can now reference\nway more than 4 GB of memory.\n\n1128\n00:55:18,499 --> 00:55:25,420\nOne application can actually reference\nup to 18.4 exabytes of information.\n\n1129\n00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,510\nNow, what the heck is an exabyte?\n\n1130\n00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:31,790\nWell, when you measure memory, when you\nmeasure storage, we start with bytes.\n\n1131\n00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:33,740\nAnd when you get to 1000\nbytes that's a kilobyte.\n\n1132\n00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,820\nAnd when you get to 1 million bytes,\nthat's a megabyte.\n\n1133\n00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,220\nAnd when you get to 1 billion bytes,\nthat's a gigabyte.\n\n1134\n00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:45,210\nWhen you get to 1 trillion bytes,\nthat's a terabyte.\n\n1135\n00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:48,140\nWell after terabyte, you get to petabyte.\n\n1136\n00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,010\nAnd after petabyte, you get to exabyte.\n\n1137\n00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,100\nSo that's really big.\n\n1138\n00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,350\nAnd exabyte is a huge amount of memory.\n\n1139\n00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,554\nMost computers these days\nare still in the gigabyte range.\n\n1140\n00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,354\nWe haven't even made it to petabyte range.\n\n1141\n00:55:59,354 --> 00:56:01,814\nAnd then even after that we\nhave to get the exabyte range.\n\n1142\n00:56:01,814 --> 00:56:06,430\nSo 64-bit numbers are big\nenough to last us a good while.\n\n1143\n00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,673\nBut in our lifetimes, well,\n\n1144\n00:56:07,673 --> 00:56:09,874\nI guess I don't know how old\nyou are there in TV land.\n\n1145\n00:56:09,874 --> 00:56:13,687\nBut definitely in my lifetime,\nwe'll probably get to 128-bit computing,\n\n1146\n00:56:13,687 --> 00:56:17,944\nbecause we'll need even more memory, it's\ngoing to happen, right, in the next, say,\n\n1147\n00:56:17,944 --> 00:56:18,915\nten years, right?\n\n1148\n00:56:18,915 --> 00:56:23,096\nBut as it stands, 64-bit is enough to be\nable to address large amounts of memory\n\n1149\n00:56:23,096 --> 00:56:24,840\nfor single applications.\n\n1150\n00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,240\nAnd it'll cover us for awhile.\n\n1151\n00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,110\nSo Apple recognized this and they said we\nneed to make our operating systems 64-bit,\n\n1152\n00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:33,470\nand they've done a really good job.\n\n1153\n00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:39,400\nApple exported 100% of the base operating\nsystem over to 64-bit applications.\n\n1154\n00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,133\nSo when you install Yosemite the whole\nthing, the whole shebang is 64 bits now.\n\n1155\n00:56:44,133 --> 00:56:46,000\nAnd that's good.\n\n1156\n00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,010\nBut when you install your own programs\nthey may or may not be, all right?\n\n1157\n00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,190\nWhen you're on a 64-bit or\n\n1158\n00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:56,590\nless like Yosemite,\nit can still run 32-bit applications.\n\n1159\n00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,340\nIt's backwards compatible, right?\n\n1160\n00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,528\nThose applications would perform\nbetter if they were 64-bit.\n\n1161\n00:57:01,528 --> 00:57:04,770\nThey could access more memory and\nrun more stably, but\n\n1162\n00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:07,700\nthey'll still run even if they're 32-bit.\n\n1163\n00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,496\nAnd Apple did that to give developers\ntime to rewrite their software and\n\n1164\n00:57:10,496 --> 00:57:11,780\nto update it, right?\n\n1165\n00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,190\nWhere we had a really big\nproblem were Web browsers.\n\n1166\n00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,940\nWeb browsers were the worst, right?\n\n1167\n00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,560\nIf you think about like Firefox or\n\n1168\n00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:22,260\nGoogle Chrome, those Web browsers,\nthat's one application.\n\n1169\n00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:26,200\nBut then they use all sorts of plugins,\nlike Adobe Flash, or extensions, or\n\n1170\n00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,280\nwhatever, all sorts of different plugins.\n\n1171\n00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,200\nThose plug-ins have to be\nrewritten to 64-bit too.\n\n1172\n00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,540\nAnd a lot of the plugin\nauthors dragged their feet.\n\n1173\n00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:41,680\nAnd so you had 64-bit Web browsers but\n32-bit plugins and that doesn't work.\n\n1174\n00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,580\nIf the Web browser is 64-bit\nthe plugins have to be 64-bit.\n\n1175\n00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:45,500\nAnd it's not just Web browsers.\n\n1176\n00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,470\nThat goes for any software.\n\n1177\n00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:48,519\nIf you have any software\nthat uses plugins,\n\n1178\n00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:53,030\nthe plugins have to be at the same\nbit version as the application.\n\n1179\n00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,960\nSo, it took time for\npeople to get that way and\n\n1180\n00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,590\nthat's why Apple kept support for 32-bit.\n\n1181\n00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:03,820\nI can run my Web browser in 32-bit mode so\nit can still use its 32-bit plugins.\n\n1182\n00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,215\nBut as soon as those plugins\nget updated to 64-bit,\n\n1183\n00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:08,100\nI need to switch over to that mode, right?\n\n1184\n00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:12,453\nFor most of us end users, we don't care\nlike if system is 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\n1185\n00:58:12,453 --> 00:58:14,690\nWe don't notice the difference, right?\n\n1186\n00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,650\nBut, it does allow us\nto address more memory.\n\n1187\n00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:21,210\nIf you have more than 4 gigabytes\nof memory in your device\n\n1188\n00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:24,140\nyou will benefit from being\nin 64-bit mode, right?\n\n1189\n00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,860\nAnd I think all Apples today,\nif you go to the website,\n\n1190\n00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,810\nI don't know if you can get\nanything with 4 gigs anymore.\n\n1191\n00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:30,910\nI think all of the systems\nstart with 8 gigs of RAM.\n\n1192\n00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:33,904\nThere might be like a Mac Mini or\nsomething that starts at four but\n\n1193\n00:58:33,904 --> 00:58:37,570\nI know all their Mac Books and their iMacs\nare all now starting at 8 gigs of RAM.\n\n1194\n00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:40,217\nSo they all benefit from being 64-bit.\n\n1195\n00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:44,327\nIf you're at 4 gigs of RAM or 2 gigs of\nRAM you're not really gonna notice much\n\n1196\n00:58:44,327 --> 00:58:47,270\ndifference between 32 and 64-bit, right?\n\n1197\n00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:52,050\nIt's not a great reason\nto push you to go 64-bit.\n\n1198\n00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:56,030\nAll right, well, let's say that I've got\none of those applications that I wanna run\n\n1199\n00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:58,330\nin 32 versus 64-bit mode, right?\n\n1200\n00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,590\nWell, let me show you\nhow this kind of works.\n\n1201\n00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:03,170\nLooking at my system,\nif I go into my Apple menu, and\n\n1202\n00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:08,130\nabout this Mac, I can see that I've\ngot 16 gigs of RAM in my computer.\n\n1203\n00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:12,490\nSo I've got more than the 32-bit\naddressable memory space.\n\n1204\n00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,560\nNow Mac OS is okay with that,\nit can deal with it.\n\n1205\n00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,143\nBut if I'm running 32-bit applications,\neach one will be limited to 4 gigs, so\n\n1206\n00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,727\nthey won't be able to use my\nwhole set of memory, all right?\n\n1207\n00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:25,623\nNow it used to be in previous versions\nof Mac OS, that you'd come in here and\n\n1208\n00:59:25,623 --> 00:59:29,745\nit would say whether you're\nrunning 32-bit or 64-bit,\n\n1209\n00:59:29,745 --> 00:59:34,487\nyou'd see it here and you'd also see\nit in system information if you went\n\n1210\n00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:38,340\ninto the system information\nutility if it ever comes up.\n\n1211\n00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,225\nI did run it, didn't I.\n\n1212\n00:59:39,225 --> 00:59:43,330\n[LAUGH]\nWe go into system information.\n\n1213\n00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:45,860\nIf it will ever launch.\n\n1214\n00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,100\nI guess maybe it thinks I'm already\nin it cuz I'm in this panel.\n\n1215\n00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:50,600\nI should try that again.\n\n1216\n00:59:53,527 --> 00:59:54,711\nThere we go.\n\n1217\n00:59:54,711 --> 00:59:57,212\nSo if we go into system information,\nyou go into software,\n\n1218\n00:59:57,212 --> 00:59:58,368\nit used to list it here too.\n\n1219\n00:59:58,368 --> 01:00:01,450\nAnd it would say that you were 32-bit or\n64-bit.\n\n1220\n01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:03,530\nNotice how mine doesn't say that, right?\n\n1221\n01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,770\nIt's not saying it because\nit's all 64-bit now.\n\n1222\n01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,986\nYosemite is a 64-bit OS so\nif you're running Yosemite,\n\n1223\n01:00:09,986 --> 01:00:11,990\nyou are running 64-bit, right?\n\n1224\n01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:13,189\nBut when you run an application,\nyou can choose to run it down in 32-bit,\n\n1225\n01:00:13,189 --> 01:00:14,149\nif the developer of that\napplication designed it that way.\n\n1226\n01:00:14,149 --> 01:00:19,301\nAll right, I mentioned how\nApple has already ported all of\n\n1227\n01:00:19,301 --> 01:00:24,351\ntheir applications over to 64-bit so\nthere's no need\n\n1228\n01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:29,311\nto run an Apple application\nin 32-bit mode, right?\n\n1229\n01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,430\nBut for third party software,\nthere might be.\n\n1230\n01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:37,220\nSo, for example,\nI've got Firefox installed on my machine.\n\n1231\n01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:40,270\nThe Firefox Web browser,\nI use it for testing and things.\n\n1232\n01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,130\nSo if I go in here and\n\n1233\n01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:45,270\nI find Firefox buried in my list of\nprograms that I've got installed.\n\n1234\n01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:48,380\nLet's see.\nThere it is, Firefox.\n\n1235\n01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,890\nI've got Firefox and if I launch that I\ncan go into my Firefox Web browser, and\n\n1236\n01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,839\nI can start browsing the Internet, okay?\n\n1237\n01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:55,988\nWell am I in 32 or 64-bit mode?\n\n1238\n01:00:55,988 --> 01:00:58,054\nI don't really know, right?\n\n1239\n01:00:58,054 --> 01:00:59,610\nI don't know, I just ran it.\n\n1240\n01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,931\nIf it's a 64-bit application\nit ran in 64-bit mode.\n\n1241\n01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:06,900\nIf it's a 32-bit application\nit ran in 32-bit mode.\n\n1242\n01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:13,680\nIf the application supports both\nmodes then it ran in 64-bit mode.\n\n1243\n01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,720\nIt defaults.\n\n1244\n01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,040\nApple defaults to 64-bit mode.\n\n1245\n01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,690\nBut if I need it to run\nin 32-bit mode I can.\n\n1246\n01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:22,280\nLet me exit the application here.\n\n1247\n01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,620\nIf I find the application icon and\n\n1248\n01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:29,180\nI do a Get Info, you can Ctrl+click and\nget info or Cmd+I.\n\n1249\n01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:32,530\nWhat you'll see is in your list,\nthis little option right here.\n\n1250\n01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,670\nOpen in 32-bit mode.\n\n1251\n01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:38,790\nI can check that, and now the next time I\nrun it, instead of running 64-bit mode,\n\n1252\n01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:41,200\nit'll run in 32-bit mode.\n\n1253\n01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,950\nSo now, if I run Firefox,\nnow it's running in 32-bit mode.\n\n1254\n01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:48,010\nAnd do you see any differences?\n\n1255\n01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:50,360\nNow, visually,\nit's not gonna look any different.\n\n1256\n01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,100\nIt's the same software.\n\n1257\n01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:55,400\nIt's just using a different\nmemory address registry size, and\n\n1258\n01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,930\nthat's making it only able to\naddress up to 4 gigs of memory.\n\n1259\n01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:00,310\nThat limitation is there, right?\n\n1260\n01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:04,130\nBut if I have 32-bit plugins,\nthey work now.\n\n1261\n01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:08,690\nIf I exit, and I go back in to 64-bit\nmode, now those 32-bit plugins don't work.\n\n1262\n01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,616\nI need to make sure I\nget the 64-bit plugins.\n\n1263\n01:02:10,616 --> 01:02:14,841\nNow, you don't have this\noption on every program.\n\n1264\n01:02:14,841 --> 01:02:19,262\nSo, let me just turn that off\ncuz I'll forget that I set it.\n\n1265\n01:02:19,262 --> 01:02:22,390\nSo, if I take Google Chrome here for\nexample and\n\n1266\n01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:27,460\nI pull up its information, see how I\ndon't have that open in 32-bit mode?\n\n1267\n01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:32,600\nWhen you install Firefox it installs\nboth the 32 and 64-bit support.\n\n1268\n01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,590\nIt's got both of them in there.\n\n1269\n01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,638\nWhen you install Chrome,\nat the time you install it,\n\n1270\n01:02:37,638 --> 01:02:42,840\nyou pick whether you want 32-bit or\n64-bit, and it only installs that mode.\n\n1271\n01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,390\nSo it didn't install both, so I don't\nhave that option to check it, all right?\n\n1272\n01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:48,530\nAnd you'll see that with\nall of Apple's stuff too.\n\n1273\n01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:51,531\nSo if I find like, Pages or\nany of the other programs,\n\n1274\n01:02:51,531 --> 01:02:53,620\nhere we'll use Pages as an example.\n\n1275\n01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:56,825\nAnd I pull up its information,\nsee I don't have that open in 32-bit mode.\n\n1276\n01:02:56,825 --> 01:03:00,120\nIt's because there is no 32-bit mode for\nit.\n\n1277\n01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:03,360\nI installed the 64-bit version,\nthat's all I have, right?\n\n1278\n01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,920\nAnd all of Apple's\napplications are like that.\n\n1279\n01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,590\nI think the exception.\n\n1280\n01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:11,850\niTunes is one exception because\niTunes has a ton of plug-ins.\n\n1281\n01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:14,836\nIt's gonna run in 64-bit mode but\nif I pull up its information,\n\n1282\n01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:17,840\nsee how I've got the open in\n32-bit mode option there, right?\n\n1283\n01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,460\nSo, it still has it.\n\n1284\n01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,530\nI think the DVD player does also.\n\n1285\n01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:22,400\nWhere is that thing?\n\n1286\n01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,480\nHere, let's take a look.\n\n1287\n01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,550\nNope, nope, I'm wrong on that one.\n\n1288\n01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:28,060\nSo the DVD player is 64-bit mode.\n\n1289\n01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,170\nSo, there's a few of them.\n\n1290\n01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:32,390\nYou can kinda browse around and look.\n\n1291\n01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:36,150\nDon't be surprised though if you\ndon't see the option to go 32 bits.\n\n1292\n01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,966\nSo like, Entropy is a third\nparty archiver I installed.\n\n1293\n01:03:38,966 --> 01:03:40,278\nIt's got 32-bit mode,\n\n1294\n01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:44,120\nright, because the developer is\nstill including both versions.\n\n1295\n01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,574\nBut if I take my Dropbox client,\nthe Dropbox client doesn't,\n\n1296\n01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:50,780\nbecause they chose not to\ninclude the 32-bit version.\n\n1297\n01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,651\nSo it's not a guarantee that\noption is gonna be there, but\n\n1298\n01:03:53,651 --> 01:03:57,887\nthat's how we can switch an application\ninto 32-bit mode, if we need it, right?\n\n1299\n01:03:57,887 --> 01:04:00,296\nBut given the choice, You wanna go 64-bit,\nright? That is the way that things go,\n\n1300\n01:04:00,296 --> 01:04:03,828\nbecause you need that to\naddress the larger memory,\n\n1301\n01:04:03,828 --> 01:04:08,880\nespecially on a system like mine\nwhere I've got 16 gigs of RAM.\n\n1302\n01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,760\nI might wanna fire up a virtual machine.\n\n1303\n01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,220\nI use virtual machines all the time.\n\n1304\n01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,130\nRight here on the show, right?\n\n1305\n01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:17,940\nYou guys have seen some of these guys like\nthis virtual Yosemite machine I've used.\n\n1306\n01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,770\nIf I can get into it.\n\n1307\n01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:24,360\nSo these virtual machines are really\nconvenient to be able to mock up\n\n1308\n01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,000\nthings and test and do stuff like that.\n\n1309\n01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,450\nWell, how much memory does\nthat virtual machine get?\n\n1310\n01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,810\nIf I'm in 32 bit mode,\nI can only give it four gigs of RAM.\n\n1311\n01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:35,600\nIf I want it to have more\nthan four gigs of RAM,\n\n1312\n01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,120\nit won't do it unless\nI'm in that 64 bit mode.\n\n1313\n01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,890\nAll right, so\nthat's the big difference there.\n\n1314\n01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:46,290\nThat's that difference between 32 and\n64 bit.\n\n1315\n01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:50,000\nSo when I installed Java,\nI installed the 64 bit version of Java and\n\n1316\n01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000\nthat's what I wanted.\n\n1317\n01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:57,826\nUnless I have a specific reason\nto go 32 bit I'm not going to.\n\n1318\n01:04:57,826 --> 01:04:58,850\nAll right, a few other things\nthat go on behind the scenes.\n\n1319\n01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:01,225\nThere's some neat stuff that's\ngoing on that we can't even see.\n\n1320\n01:05:01,225 --> 01:05:03,226\nLike application sand-boxing.\n\n1321\n01:05:03,226 --> 01:05:03,837\nAlright.\n\n1322\n01:05:03,837 --> 01:05:06,510\nApplication sand-boxing is a neat idea.\n\n1323\n01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:09,810\nIt says, when an application runs,\nit need access to memory.\n\n1324\n01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:11,510\nAnd we know that, right?\n\n1325\n01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:15,210\nIf I'm running two applications,\nthey both need access to memory.\n\n1326\n01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,800\nWell, what happens if one application\n\n1327\n01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,170\naccesses the memory another\napplication is using.\n\n1328\n01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:24,400\nIf they'd both try and\naccess the same memory.\n\n1329\n01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,580\nWell, we can get data corruption.\n\n1330\n01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:29,070\nWell, best case scenario,\nwe get data corruption, and\n\n1331\n01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:30,840\nthe applications crash, right?\n\n1332\n01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,640\nOne application crashes,\nit takes the others with it.\n\n1333\n01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:38,030\nWorst case scenario,\none application could be malware and\n\n1334\n01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:41,550\nit could be reading memory from other\napplications and leaking their data out.\n\n1335\n01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:43,470\nThat's how the Target\ncredit card hack happened.\n\n1336\n01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:46,350\nThere was software that was running\nthat was scraping all the memory in\n\n1337\n01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:49,400\nthat computer, looking any time a credit\ncard number passed through RAM.\n\n1338\n01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,050\nAnd that's where it was getting it,\nvery advanced software.\n\n1339\n01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,470\nSo, that kind of stuff is a problem.\n\n1340\n01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:58,420\nWell, in Yosemite when you run\nan application it runs in a sandbox mode,\n\n1341\n01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,720\nwell most applications,\nalmost all of them.\n\n1342\n01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:05,820\nRuns in sandbox mode, where it's\nisolated from the other applications.\n\n1343\n01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:06,910\nThere's two benefits to that.\n\n1344\n01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:08,530\nBenefit number one,\n\n1345\n01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:12,500\none application is unable to read\nthe memory of another application.\n\n1346\n01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,320\nThey're isolated.\n\n1347\n01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,380\nThey're separated.\n\n1348\n01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,430\nThat's benefit number one.\n\n1349\n01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:16,970\nThat's security.\n\n1350\n01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,270\nBenefit number two.\n\n1351\n01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:21,770\nIf one application crashes,\nit won't affect the other applications.\n\n1352\n01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,110\nIt won't take them with it.\n\n1353\n01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:23,820\nRight.\nAnd\n\n1354\n01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:27,620\nI know we always joke about Windows having\nblue screens and crashing a lot, but\n\n1355\n01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:28,615\nMacs crash too.\n\n1356\n01:06:28,615 --> 01:06:30,920\nI've crashed mine more than\na few number of times.\n\n1357\n01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,110\nAnd, when they crash, you don't want\nto have to reboot your whole computer.\n\n1358\n01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:35,880\nYou don't want to lose\neverything you're working on.\n\n1359\n01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,030\nIt's just one program.\n\n1360\n01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:39,730\nBut that one program crash will\nleave all the rest of them alone.\n\n1361\n01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:43,360\nThat's called protected memory and\nYosemite makes use of protective memory\n\n1362\n01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:47,020\nall throughout the system to\nensure stability and security.\n\n1363\n01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,660\nAll right?\nIt's a nice feature to have.\n\n1364\n01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:52,780\nNow when I run an application,\nI don't have to tell it to sandbox it.\n\n1365\n01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:53,670\nIt does it automatically.\n\n1366\n01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:54,920\nIt's kind of part of the system.\n\n1367\n01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,590\nIt's gonna run it.\nIt's gonna be isolated,\n\n1368\n01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:58,030\nprotected and off we go.\n\n1369\n01:06:58,030 --> 01:07:01,580\nAnd if you've ever had to\nforce quit an application.\n\n1370\n01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:03,780\nThat's basically what you're doing,\nis crashing one program,\n\n1371\n01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:08,320\nand your other programs stay up and happy.\n\n1372\n01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,080\nI'll talk about force\nquitting a little bit later.\n\n1373\n01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,420\nI'll do that in the next segment.\n\n1374\n01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:14,780\nBut another part of\napplication sandboxing,\n\n1375\n01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,440\nit actually goes beyond just\nthe running application.\n\n1376\n01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,750\nIt even tackles things like preferences.\n\n1377\n01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,770\nThere's a problem with preferences files.\n\n1378\n01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:25,930\nBy default, all your preferences files\nare stored in the same spot, right.\n\n1379\n01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:29,090\nSo either slash library\nslash preferences or\n\n1380\n01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:32,690\nslash library slash your\nuser name slash preferences.\n\n1381\n01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:35,550\nRight, that's usually where\nthe preferences files go.\n\n1382\n01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:36,700\nThat means when you run a program,\n\n1383\n01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:40,280\nthe program needs to be allowed to\nwrite to the preferences folder.\n\n1384\n01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:44,340\nWell, if you ever look at the permissions\non that preferences folder,\n\n1385\n01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:49,140\none application could write to\nthe preferences of another application.\n\n1386\n01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:52,840\nSo I could write some malicious\nsoftware that ran on a Mac.\n\n1387\n01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,870\nAnd modified the preferences\nof other programs to make\n\n1388\n01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:58,650\nthem do things that we might not want to,\nright?\n\n1389\n01:07:58,650 --> 01:07:59,910\nThat's a risk.\n\n1390\n01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:04,530\nSo, Apple has extended out sandboxing to\nnot only include the memory addressing for\n\n1391\n01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:08,540\nthe applications, but also to include\nthings like the application support files.\n\n1392\n01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:09,100\nThe preferences.\n\n1393\n01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:16,185\nNow, when we were doing an episode on\npreferences, I mentioned one application,\n\n1394\n01:08:16,185 --> 01:08:18,485\nor at least I think I did,\nthis Write application that I use.\n\n1395\n01:08:18,485 --> 01:08:19,485\nI use this program called Write.\n\n1396\n01:08:19,485 --> 01:08:22,125\nIt's a little text editor that\ndoes mark down and stuff.\n\n1397\n01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:24,770\nI use it for all of my show notes,\nright, so if I pull up.\n\n1398\n01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:26,783\nHere's the shout outs for today's episode.\n\n1399\n01:08:26,783 --> 01:08:28,186\nLet me fire that up.\n\n1400\n01:08:28,186 --> 01:08:28,940\nHere we go.\n\n1401\n01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,720\nSo, I get in here and\nthis is where I work on my show notes.\n\n1402\n01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,621\nLike right now, we're talking\nabout sandboxing which is here.\n\n1403\n01:08:35,621 --> 01:08:37,800\nThis is what I'm talking about right now.\n\n1404\n01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:42,000\nSo, I work on that stuff and\nI use this program a lot.\n\n1405\n01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,600\nIt saves its preferences.\n\n1406\n01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:50,080\nWell I would expect the preferences to be\nin /Users/username/Library/Preferences.\n\n1407\n01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,930\nOr if they were global preferences, I'd\nexpect them to be in /Library/Preferences.\n\n1408\n01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,950\nThat's where I expect it to be, all right.\n\n1409\n01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:57,930\nBut if I go and look in those folders.\n\n1410\n01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:01,060\nSo I'm going to fire up\nmy terminal here and\n\n1411\n01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:06,010\nlet me go into /Library /preferences.\n\n1412\n01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:08,170\nOkay.\nAnd there's a lot of stuff in here so\n\n1413\n01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:11,410\nI'm gonna just look for the word Write.\n\n1414\n01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:14,420\nI'm pretty sure it's capitalized but\nif I make it lower case, there we are.\n\n1415\n01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,340\nSo, I'm not finding the word\nwrite in there anywhere.\n\n1416\n01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:22,740\nSo apparently I don't have preferences\nin the main preference folder.\n\n1417\n01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:25,820\nIf I change into my individual user.\n\n1418\n01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:35,730\nAnd I do the same kind of lookup here and\nI don't have anything in there either.\n\n1419\n01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:37,150\nRight.\nSo\n\n1420\n01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:39,580\nwhere is this program\nsaving its preferences?\n\n1421\n01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:42,710\nWell this application has been sandboxed.\n\n1422\n01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:46,380\nAnd that means it's not using these\nlocations for its preferences.\n\n1423\n01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:48,850\nInstead it's using my sandbox.\n\n1424\n01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:50,530\nIf, in my user profile here.\n\n1425\n01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:51,700\nSo if I look at my path.\n\n1426\n01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:56,890\nI'm in user/dpezet/library/preferences.\n\n1427\n01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:59,205\nIf I get back in to my personal directory,\n\n1428\n01:09:59,205 --> 01:10:04,430\n/user/dpezet/library there's\na folder in here called containers.\n\n1429\n01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:12,200\nIf I go into containers, the containers\nfolder has sandboxed folders for\n\n1430\n01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,380\nall of my applications,\nwhere they're isolated from each other.\n\n1431\n01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:18,850\nWhere one can't overwrite the other.\n\n1432\n01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:23,460\nIf you look at what's in there, you'll see\na list of all your various applications\n\n1433\n01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:28,850\nand their names, and right there, that's\nthe write program that I use, all right?\n\n1434\n01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:31,140\nIt's got its own folders,\nthese are all folders.\n\n1435\n01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,770\nAnd the folder has permissions\nthat are set on it so\n\n1436\n01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:37,610\nthat only that one application\ncan get into that folder.\n\n1437\n01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:38,530\nAnd if I change into that folder.\n\n1438\n01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:48,871\nAnd I take a look, I'll see it's got\na little p-list right in there, but\n\n1439\n01:10:48,871 --> 01:10:49,430\na data folder.\n\n1440\n01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:50,023\nAnd if I go into data, look what it's got.\n\n1441\n01:10:50,023 --> 01:10:53,180\nDesktop, documents, downloads,\nlibrary, movies, music, pictures.\n\n1442\n01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:56,450\nIt's got representations of all of\nthe things that I would expect to be in\n\n1443\n01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:57,620\nmy library.\n\n1444\n01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:02,980\nWhen I got into /user/dpezet/library, I\nexpect to see some of these things in it.\n\n1445\n01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:05,270\nOr just in my profile as a general, right?\n\n1446\n01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:08,510\nSo /user/dpezet,\nI expect to see these folders.\n\n1447\n01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:10,970\nWell here, some of these are links, right?\n\n1448\n01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:12,220\nMovies, desktop, downloads.\n\n1449\n01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:17,270\nThose are actually pointing to my\nprofile too /user/dpezet/desktop.\n\n1450\n01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:19,900\nBut, see how library doesn't.\n\n1451\n01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,360\nLibrary's not a pointer.\n\n1452\n01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:26,190\nThis is an isolated, private library\njust for this one application.\n\n1453\n01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:30,890\nAnd if I go in there I'll see\na Preferences folder that is also\n\n1454\n01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:32,240\nnot a link.\n\n1455\n01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:35,790\nAnd if I go in there I'll see,\n\n1456\n01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:37,860\nmy screen's getting a little messy,\nlet me clear that up.\n\n1457\n01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:41,800\nWell I guess this is just gonna\nbe too much data for the screen.\n\n1458\n01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:45,763\nBut I'll see that it's got all of\nthese preferences files just for\n\n1459\n01:11:45,763 --> 01:11:47,690\nthis one application, right?\n\n1460\n01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:51,376\nThe preferences of the application\nitself as well as preferences for\n\n1461\n01:11:51,376 --> 01:11:53,482\nthe general system that we can look to.\n\n1462\n01:11:53,482 --> 01:11:56,291\nAnd they're all isolated\ndown to just this program.\n\n1463\n01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,755\nAll the other programs\ndon't show up in here.\n\n1464\n01:11:57,755 --> 01:11:59,793\nSo when I run this application,\n\n1465\n01:11:59,793 --> 01:12:03,800\nit can't even see the preferences\nof the other applications.\n\n1466\n01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:08,550\nIt's safe, it's isolated, it can modify\nits own preferences, and that's it.\n\n1467\n01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:12,640\nThis whole data set has been\nvirtualized and sandboxed,\n\n1468\n01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,440\nisolated just for this one program.\n\n1469\n01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,310\nAll right, so nice way to isolate\nthat out, nice protection, and\n\n1470\n01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:22,070\nthat's why I didn't find those\npreferences in the main folder.\n\n1471\n01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:25,845\nThey were here, buried away,\ninside of this sandbox folder,\n\n1472\n01:12:25,845 --> 01:12:29,530\n/user/dpezet/library/containers.\n\n1473\n01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:34,490\nAnd then the name of\nthe application /data and\n\n1474\n01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:39,430\nthen it's virtual view of my system,\nso /library, /preferences and so on.\n\n1475\n01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:41,030\nRight, it's a virtualized view for\nthat program alone.\n\n1476\n01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:44,930\nAll right, important to remember that and\nfor the exam, you'll want to\n\n1477\n01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:47,670\nremember that path, the container's part,\nthat's the key part to remember.\n\n1478\n01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:53,730\nAll right, so\nthat's enough about application isolation.\n\n1479\n01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:58,240\nI did mention force quitting apps,\nand how when an app might malfunction,\n\n1480\n01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,600\nwe might have to quit out of it.\n\n1481\n01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,060\nThere's actually a lot of\ndifferent troubleshooting and\n\n1482\n01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:06,040\ndiagnostic tools that are built into MAC\nOS for troubleshooting your applications.\n\n1483\n01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:08,340\nAnd I want to take some\ntime to look at those and\n\n1484\n01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:11,620\nkind of detail how they function, but I'm\na little short on time on this segment.\n\n1485\n01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:15,210\nSo let's pause and take a break and\nwhen we get back we'll talk about\n\n1486\n01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:17,820\ntroubleshooting applications when\nthey're not behaving themselves.\n\n1487\n01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,987\nSo, stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n1488\n01:13:19,987 --> 01:13:20,672\n[MUSIC]\n\n1489\n01:13:20,672 --> 01:13:27,511\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1490\n01:13:27,511 --> 01:13:32,086\nSo believe it or not, occasionally\napplications don't work the way they're\n\n1491\n01:13:32,086 --> 01:13:34,870\nsupposed to and\nthen we start to have problems.\n\n1492\n01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:38,850\nAnd when we have problems, well, Apple's\ngiven us quite a few tools to be able to\n\n1493\n01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:41,510\nwork with those applications to try and\nsolve our problem, or\n\n1494\n01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:44,000\nat least find out where\nthe problem is coming from.\n\n1495\n01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,070\nOne of the most common\nscenarios that I hear or\n\n1496\n01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:50,210\nI see myself sometimes, is where your\ncomputer starts to run really sluggishly.\n\n1497\n01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:54,210\nIt starts to get slow, that usually\nindicates that one program is using more\n\n1498\n01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:56,620\nresources than other\nprograms on your system.\n\n1499\n01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:59,190\nAnd so,\nhow do you know which program it is?\n\n1500\n01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:03,460\nWell fortunately we have a neat utility\ncalled the Activity Monitor in our system\n\n1501\n01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:07,010\nthat we can use to find out which program\nis consuming the most resources, right?\n\n1502\n01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:11,290\nLet me show you how this works, when\nwe're in our computer and we're running.\n\n1503\n01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:14,140\nWe know what applications we're\nrunning because we can look, well,\n\n1504\n01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:16,330\nat a minimum we can look down\nhere in our dock, right?\n\n1505\n01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:19,730\nAnything that has a dot beneath it is\nsomething that's actively running.\n\n1506\n01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:23,034\nSo I can see that I'm running Finder,\nand Google Chrome, Parallels Desktop,\n\n1507\n01:14:23,034 --> 01:14:26,160\nI got a couple of different things\nthat are running down here.\n\n1508\n01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,340\nBut what that doesn't tell me is,\nwho's currently busy,\n\n1509\n01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:33,330\nwho's doing things, and for\nthat I've got the Activity Monitor.\n\n1510\n01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:36,820\nIt's on your hard drive in\nthe Applications folder and\n\n1511\n01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:40,200\ninside of Applications,\nyou'll find a folder called Utilities and\n\n1512\n01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,550\nthe Activity Monitor is right there.\n\n1513\n01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:44,660\nSo I can just fire up that\nActivity Monitor, and\n\n1514\n01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:48,630\nit's gonna show me what programs\nare active on my system right now.\n\n1515\n01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:51,180\nThat's what this process name\ncolumn is here, this big list,\n\n1516\n01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:53,440\nthese are showing all\nthe programs that are running.\n\n1517\n01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,247\nThese include applications that\nI'm running in user land, right,\n\n1518\n01:14:57,247 --> 01:15:00,138\nthey're the things that I\nactually see on my screen.\n\n1519\n01:15:00,138 --> 01:15:03,940\nLike the activity monitor itself\nright there, I'll see Viscosity,\n\n1520\n01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:07,910\nthat's my VPN client, Undock is\nthe utility I use for my docking station.\n\n1521\n01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:12,740\nThese are all different programs that\nI'm running and I can see them, but\n\n1522\n01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:16,760\nthere's also a lot of programs that are\nrunning in the background of my system.\n\n1523\n01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,530\nThe operating system itself is\nrunning different resources and\n\n1524\n01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:22,400\nthese are our support services or\n\n1525\n01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:26,590\ndemons that are running in the background\nthat we don't normally interact with.\n\n1526\n01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:30,660\nWhen your system is running sluggish, it\nmight be a program that you're running or\n\n1527\n01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,130\nit might be a program that Mac OS\nis running in the background and\n\n1528\n01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:34,960\nwe need to be able to see that.\n\n1529\n01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:39,220\nWell in this screen,\nwe can see the applications and\n\n1530\n01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:41,190\nsome basic details about each.\n\n1531\n01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:45,120\nThis percent CPU column is normally\nthe one that we're looking for,\n\n1532\n01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,580\nthis is gonna show us who\nis consuming the most CPU.\n\n1533\n01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:54,220\nAll right now, don't be surprised if the\nnumber for CPU percentage adds up to more\n\n1534\n01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:59,680\nthan 100% because you likely have more\nthan one processor core in your system.\n\n1535\n01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,640\nAnd so as you look at\nthe different resources in here,\n\n1536\n01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,330\nthey may add up to more than 100%.\n\n1537\n01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:07,130\nBut looking at mine I can see that I've\ngot some program running right here,\n\n1538\n01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:10,350\nsomething about a butterfly site.\n\n1539\n01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:12,240\nI actually have no idea what that is,\n\n1540\n01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:15,580\nso www.thebutterflysite.com,\nI should probably find out what that is.\n\n1541\n01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:19,610\nBecause it's eating up 100% of one of my\ncores right now, so it's actually really,\n\n1542\n01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:22,540\nreally busy and\nit's been that way for a long time.\n\n1543\n01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:27,690\nIf I look at my CPU time,\nI'm at basically 1 hour,\n\n1544\n01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:32,930\n2 minutes, and 38 seconds, so over\nan hour of time the processor has spent\n\n1545\n01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:37,650\nworking on this application, and I'm not\neven sure what that application is, right?\n\n1546\n01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:38,970\nSo, that's a problem.\n\n1547\n01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:43,010\nWell, I have kind of an idea, see how it's\ngot a little dot dot dot right there?\n\n1548\n01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:46,660\nThat means there's more information about\nthis that wouldn't fit on the screen, and\n\n1549\n01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:49,120\nso it's probably Google Chrome, or\n\n1550\n01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:53,260\nsome other application that's running,\nand consuming those extra resources.\n\n1551\n01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:54,940\nAnd I probably have more than one tab, so\n\n1552\n01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:58,740\nthat all starts to add up after a while,\nbut it could be malicious software.\n\n1553\n01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:01,350\nI could've had something installed\non my machine that I'm not aware of.\n\n1554\n01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:05,410\nI do see over here that it's running\nas me, dpezet under the user column,\n\n1555\n01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:08,000\nso I know it's me that's running it.\n\n1556\n01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,740\nWhat could that be?\n\n1557\n01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,820\nWell, I could kill the application and\n\n1558\n01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:13,520\nfind out that way,\nwhat every closes or goes away.\n\n1559\n01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,960\nBut, I really should try and\nfind out more about that, right?\n\n1560\n01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:17,870\nWell, if you look up here,\n\n1561\n01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:20,880\nyou've got a couple of little\nbuttons you can use to do just that.\n\n1562\n01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,650\nI've got this x and that's gonna\nforce quit that application or\n\n1563\n01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:25,400\nkill that process.\n\n1564\n01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,350\nIf I don't know what that is and\nI wanna just kill it outright,\n\n1565\n01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:31,540\nI can hit that little x right there and\nthen I'll kill it, right?\n\n1566\n01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:35,640\nIf it's a running application that I can\nsee, like down here on my task bar, well,\n\n1567\n01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,770\nyou can Ctrl+Click or\nright-click on the icon.\n\n1568\n01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:42,958\nLike if I had Chrome right here,\nI could Ctrl+Click on it, and\n\n1569\n01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:45,960\nsee how I've got quit right there?\n\n1570\n01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,940\nIf the application was frozen or\n\n1571\n01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:52,370\nnot responding, that quit would\nactually show up as force quit.\n\n1572\n01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:54,680\nIn my case,\nthe application's running just fine, but\n\n1573\n01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:59,540\nif I hit the option key on my keyboard,\nsee how quit changes to force quit?\n\n1574\n01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:02,980\nI can force quit and that will\nterminate that application right now,\n\n1575\n01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:05,710\nit'll just end it, kill it,\nand then I'll be done with it.\n\n1576\n01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:09,690\nWhen you use this x up here,\nthat's a force quit also.\n\n1577\n01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:13,480\nAnd while I'm on the topic of force quit,\nit is something that shows up on the exam.\n\n1578\n01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,170\nIn the objectives,\n\n1579\n01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:18,010\nthey say they want you to know the three\nways to force quit an application, right?\n\n1580\n01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:20,827\nMethod number one is\nright here in our dock,\n\n1581\n01:18:20,827 --> 01:18:25,792\nwe just Ctrl+click an application,\nhold down Option, and hit Force Quit.\n\n1582\n01:18:25,792 --> 01:18:28,790\nRight, that's method number one.\n\n1583\n01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:34,690\nMethod number two is, in the application\nitself, you can go up the Apple menu and\n\n1584\n01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:37,740\nin the Apple menu,\nyou'll have Force Quit right there.\n\n1585\n01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:40,313\nAll right,\nthat's method number two and then,\n\n1586\n01:18:40,313 --> 01:18:43,400\nmethod number three is\nin the Activity Monitor.\n\n1587\n01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,600\nWe find the application in here,\nhere's Google Chrome, then we hit the X,\n\n1588\n01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,950\nand when you hit that,\nit's going to close out and it's gone.\n\n1589\n01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:52,640\nRight, three different ways to force\nquit out of an application and\n\n1590\n01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,050\nthat's not even counting dropping\nthe terminal and using the kill command.\n\n1591\n01:18:56,050 --> 01:19:00,180\nEvery process has an ID,\nI see can that Chrome is process ID 62.\n\n1592\n01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:03,327\nI could open up my terminal and\nI could say, kill 62 or wait, it's not 62,\n\n1593\n01:19:03,327 --> 01:19:03,960\nit's 407.\n\n1594\n01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:09,980\nThe PID, that's the processed ID,\nI was looking in the wrong Chrome.\n\n1595\n01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:14,241\nSo Chrome has a process ID of 407, I could\ntype kill 407 and that would remove it and\n\n1596\n01:19:14,241 --> 01:19:14,825\nget it out.\n\n1597\n01:19:14,825 --> 01:19:16,395\nSo there's several different\nways to go about it.\n\n1598\n01:19:18,255 --> 01:19:23,165\nThe next item here is this letter i and\nif I hit that, that'll get additional\n\n1599\n01:19:23,165 --> 01:19:27,862\ninformation about what that is and\nI can see here it's Spotlight Web Content.\n\n1600\n01:19:27,862 --> 01:19:28,732\nRight, so\n\n1601\n01:19:28,732 --> 01:19:32,862\nI had no idea what that application\nwas because the name was a URL.\n\n1602\n01:19:32,862 --> 01:19:36,972\nSome website that apparently I've been to,\nor maybe I don't know about it,\n\n1603\n01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:39,182\nmaybe it's malicious software\nthat was going there.\n\n1604\n01:19:39,182 --> 01:19:42,105\nBut it's Spotlight, that's doing it,\nnow Spotlight has support for\n\n1605\n01:19:42,105 --> 01:19:44,736\nsearching your local hard drive,\nas well as searching the web,\n\n1606\n01:19:44,736 --> 01:19:47,332\nas well as searching your favorites,\nand your applications.\n\n1607\n01:19:47,332 --> 01:19:52,123\nSo it can search through a ton of stuff\nand apparently it's searching something,\n\n1608\n01:19:52,123 --> 01:19:54,842\nbut it's CPU percentage is up there,\nright.\n\n1609\n01:19:54,842 --> 01:19:58,394\nIt's using 100% CPU power\non one of my cores.\n\n1610\n01:19:58,394 --> 01:20:02,283\nTo be able to create that index, and I\nmight not be too happy about that, right?\n\n1611\n01:20:02,283 --> 01:20:03,951\nI might wanna kill that off and\n\n1612\n01:20:03,951 --> 01:20:08,432\nstop it because I want my system to run\na little faster or less resource intense.\n\n1613\n01:20:12,123 --> 01:20:17,649\nAll right, now looking at CPU,\nthat's one thing, but there's also memory.\n\n1614\n01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:19,785\nWho's eating up all of my RAM?\n\n1615\n01:20:19,785 --> 01:20:22,256\nAnd when I go into memory and\nsort by the memory column,\n\n1616\n01:20:22,256 --> 01:20:24,207\nI can actually see their spotlight again.\n\n1617\n01:20:24,207 --> 01:20:27,947\n5.7 gigs of my RAM is being\neaten up by Spotlight right now.\n\n1618\n01:20:27,947 --> 01:20:31,125\nMy system is spending\na lot of CPU time and\n\n1619\n01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:36,188\na lot of RAM updating this index,\nit's outta control, right?\n\n1620\n01:20:36,188 --> 01:20:40,555\nNow, does that indicate a problem,\nor is this a good thing, right?\n\n1621\n01:20:40,555 --> 01:20:43,365\nIs it good that it's indexing all this so\nI'll get better Spotlight searches?\n\n1622\n01:20:43,365 --> 01:20:45,840\nOr should I kill that off and\nthen go on and\n\n1623\n01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,945\nadjust Spotlight to stop indexing\nwhatever the heck it's indexing, right?\n\n1624\n01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:52,751\nSo, there's more than likely something\nwrong here that Spotlight would be running\n\n1625\n01:20:52,751 --> 01:20:53,459\nthat heavily.\n\n1626\n01:20:53,459 --> 01:20:57,406\nBut I can see that memory utilization\nway above even the next couple of ones,\n\n1627\n01:20:57,406 --> 01:21:01,476\nspeech recognition that I turned on\nearlier is running 842 megs of memory,\n\n1628\n01:21:01,476 --> 01:21:03,959\nalmost a gig of memory for\nspeech recognition.\n\n1629\n01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:07,900\nAnd then I see the kernel at 794 megs and\nthen beyond that.\n\n1630\n01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:12,870\nSo if my system is running slow, it's\nprobably because almost half my memory\n\n1631\n01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:15,540\nis tied up in these two\napplications right here and\n\n1632\n01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:18,650\nthose aren't even applications\nI'm using right now.\n\n1633\n01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:22,970\nAnd under CPU, well, looks like system\nmonitor is cranked up a little bit for\n\n1634\n01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:24,170\na second there, but there we go.\n\n1635\n01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:24,800\nSpotlight is up.\n\n1636\n01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,000\nThe speech recognition is not up because\nI'm not actively using it right now.\n\n1637\n01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:31,890\nThere's other breakdowns in here,\nlike energy,\n\n1638\n01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:35,810\nwho's making me eat up\nthe most battery power, disk?\n\n1639\n01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:38,635\nWho's generating the most disk I/O,\nwriting to the hard drive?\n\n1640\n01:21:38,635 --> 01:21:41,110\nAnd the network who's\nusing the most bandwidth.\n\n1641\n01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:43,118\nAnd on all of these,\nI expect to see parallels.\n\n1642\n01:21:43,118 --> 01:21:46,402\nWhen you run a virtual machine, it takes\nup a lot of disk IO, a lot of processor,\n\n1643\n01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:48,474\na lot of memory, so\nyou expect to see that higher.\n\n1644\n01:21:48,474 --> 01:21:50,367\nI didn't expect to see\nSpotlight that high.\n\n1645\n01:21:50,367 --> 01:21:52,295\nBut it is, so there it is.\n\n1646\n01:21:52,295 --> 01:21:56,002\nAnd oh, actually I can see right there,\nlooking under Spotlight,\n\n1647\n01:21:56,002 --> 01:21:58,678\nthe Spotlight Web content\nhas actually failed.\n\n1648\n01:21:58,678 --> 01:22:00,339\nNot responding, all right.\n\n1649\n01:22:00,339 --> 01:22:02,500\nSo it's not very happy.\n\n1650\n01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,190\nI should probably force quit that.\n\n1651\n01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:05,230\nAnd so I'll go ahead and do that.\n\n1652\n01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:08,490\nI'm gonna force quit that and it's just\nletting me know that Spotlight Web content\n\n1653\n01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:10,530\nis gonna force quit out, so I'll do that.\n\n1654\n01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:13,960\nThat's gonna terminate it,\nrelease those resources.\n\n1655\n01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:18,220\nAnd Spotlight will just rerun it again\nhere in a moment to start its index over.\n\n1656\n01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:21,330\nAnd hopefully whatever was wrong\nwith it will be corrected and\n\n1657\n01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:22,009\nnow we're back in business.\n\n1658\n01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:29,070\nAll right, now, what I just did there\nis I fixed the symptom, not the cause.\n\n1659\n01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:32,320\nThe symptom was Spotlight was eating\nup too much memory on my system, and\n\n1660\n01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,840\nSpotlight was eating up\ntoo much processor power.\n\n1661\n01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,300\nNow that it's terminated,\nthe symptom is gone.\n\n1662\n01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:38,950\nBut what was the cause?\n\n1663\n01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:41,560\nWhy was Spotlight eating\nup that much memory?\n\n1664\n01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,480\nWhy was Spotlight running\nat such a high CPU level?\n\n1665\n01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,100\nWell, I don't know.\n\n1666\n01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,570\nI fixed it, but I don't know why.\n\n1667\n01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:51,800\nIn fact, looking at my CPU load, see how\nmy chart just drops off right there.\n\n1668\n01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,750\nThat's where I terminated Spotlight, and\nnow I've got tons of available resources.\n\n1669\n01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:59,440\nMy system is considerably happier\nthan it was just a moment ago.\n\n1670\n01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,850\nAnd same thing under memory.\n\n1671\n01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:05,762\nIf I watch my memory guy meters and stuff\ndown here I'll see it did drops off too.\n\n1672\n01:23:05,762 --> 01:23:07,479\nActually it's not gonna\nshow that right now.\n\n1673\n01:23:07,479 --> 01:23:11,727\nBut, that was all tied to the cancelling\nof that one application, right?\n\n1674\n01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:14,130\nWell if we wanna try and\n\n1675\n01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:19,110\nfind out why things went that crazy,\nI need to look at my system logs, right?\n\n1676\n01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:22,010\nHopefully the application generated a log\n\n1677\n01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:24,850\nof what was going on at\nthe time when it crashed.\n\n1678\n01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:28,160\nNow the system logs are actually\nstored in your system library so\n\n1679\n01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,900\nyou can browse into that logs file and\nfind them there.\n\n1680\n01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,603\nI know I talked about that\nin another show somewhere.\n\n1681\n01:23:32,603 --> 01:23:38,060\nBut that's a pretty difficult way to view\nthings, like looking at the raw log files.\n\n1682\n01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:42,465\nApple actually has a really cool utility\ncalled the Console that you can use to\n\n1683\n01:23:42,465 --> 01:23:44,330\nview those logs in real-time.\n\n1684\n01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:46,910\nIt's a neat utility,\na lot of people don't know about it.\n\n1685\n01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:49,670\nIf I go back into my\nApplications folder and\n\n1686\n01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:54,240\nback into Utilities,\nyou'll find a utility called Console.\n\n1687\n01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:58,940\nAnd if you run that, this is like a log\nviewer, but it's a log viewer on steroids.\n\n1688\n01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:01,160\nI can see all the different logs for\nmy system.\n\n1689\n01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,890\nAnd it's in real-time.\n\n1690\n01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:07,190\nYou might not see it right now, but\nas new log entries are being put in,\n\n1691\n01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:10,260\nit's actually adding them and\nlive updating the screen.\n\n1692\n01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:14,050\nSo this is a current view of what's\ngoing on, on my system, and so\n\n1693\n01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:15,810\nI can see any kinda log\nmessages I'm getting.\n\n1694\n01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:20,480\nLike here, my xClipboard program had a\nproblem, it says unable to load NIB file.\n\n1695\n01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,510\nMain menu exiting.\n\n1696\n01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:23,530\nI don't know what a NIB file is.\n\n1697\n01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:25,600\nBut it looks like there's\nsomething wrong with xClipboard.\n\n1698\n01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,770\nSo if it's not working right,\nI need to go and check with that vendor.\n\n1699\n01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:33,900\nAnd find out what's wrong with that,\nand kinda work out what that issue is.\n\n1700\n01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:37,880\nI didn't think I was actually running\nxClipboard right now, but apparently I am.\n\n1701\n01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,960\nNow notice how it's starting to\nscroll off the top of my screen.\n\n1702\n01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,890\nThat's cuz there's more stuff\nthat's being logged down here.\n\n1703\n01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:45,050\nAnd I can see more xClipboard stuff.\n\n1704\n01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:47,320\nxClipboard is not having a good day.\n\n1705\n01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:51,890\nAnd I kind of figured because I don't\nsee its icon up here in my taskbar.\n\n1706\n01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:55,680\nxClipboard's a little utility I use that\nlets you copy and paste multiple things.\n\n1707\n01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,040\nYou have more than one clipboard,\nwhich I like.\n\n1708\n01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:02,430\nBut I can see here service\nexited with abnormal code 1.\n\n1709\n01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,140\nIt's trying to launch.\n\n1710\n01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:07,660\nAnd the program is crashing over,\nand over, and over again.\n\n1711\n01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:09,240\nAnd I can see it here.\n\n1712\n01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:13,470\nAnd I can expand this out, and I can get\na little bit more information about it.\n\n1713\n01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:16,440\nAnd this is the kinda stuff that\nthe developer might want to see.\n\n1714\n01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,560\nI can send this over to the developer,\nand say hey this is what I'm getting.\n\n1715\n01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,090\nI'm getting unable to load NIB file.\n\n1716\n01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:22,300\nDo you know what it is?\n\n1717\n01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,100\nAnd they can look at it,\ntroubleshoot it, and\n\n1718\n01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:27,340\ngive us information back about it,\nall right?\n\n1719\n01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:28,640\nSo interesting stuff there.\n\n1720\n01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,100\nYou'll see other things,\nlike my User Diagnostic Reports.\n\n1721\n01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:31,880\nYou can browse in and\n\n1722\n01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:35,130\nyou'll see breakdowns for\ncrashes that you've had, right?\n\n1723\n01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:39,150\nSo like my LCC-Demon has\napparently crashed at some point.\n\n1724\n01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:40,270\nI don't actually know what that is.\n\n1725\n01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:41,670\nOh, Logitech Control.\n\n1726\n01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:44,590\nSo I use a little Logitech\ntrackball on my laptop.\n\n1727\n01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:47,880\nI've got a unifying receiver over here and\nit crashed once.\n\n1728\n01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:51,490\nAnd when it crashed,\nI can see the crash data right here.\n\n1729\n01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:54,570\nAnd it's telling me exactly what was\ngoing on when the crash happened,\n\n1730\n01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:57,360\nwhat files were being accessed,\nand everything.\n\n1731\n01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,270\nNow this data might be useless to me.\n\n1732\n01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:01,970\nWhen I look at it,\nthis might not tell me anything.\n\n1733\n01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:06,220\nBut if I copy that and send it to\nthe developer, they can take this and\n\n1734\n01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,500\ninterpret it to find out why\nthat program crashed, and\n\n1735\n01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:11,430\nactually figure out what went wrong,\nright?\n\n1736\n01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:13,230\nThat's what the Console application does.\n\n1737\n01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:14,910\nIt interprets those crash logs.\n\n1738\n01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:17,000\nAnd these are just being read\nright from the hard drive.\n\n1739\n01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,800\nThese are stored in those log folders that\nwe talked about in an earlier episode.\n\n1740\n01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,750\nThey're just being stored as text files.\n\n1741\n01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:26,613\nYou can read them from the terminal if you\nwant, but this view is so much easier.\n\n1742\n01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:32,110\nAll right, so those are available for us.\n\n1743\n01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:34,940\nGreat for troubleshooting, great for\nfiguring that out, but at the end of\n\n1744\n01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,800\nthe day, we do often times have to\nreach out to the developer for support.\n\n1745\n01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,990\nSo for my xClipboard problems for\n\n1746\n01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:42,820\nexample, I probably need to\nreach out to that developer.\n\n1747\n01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:44,830\nAnd I could force quit the app,\nalthough it's quitting on its own.\n\n1748\n01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:47,760\nIt's crashing over and over.\n\n1749\n01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,796\nSo I could try uninstalling and\nreinstalling it.\n\n1750\n01:26:49,796 --> 01:26:51,292\nSomething like that to try and\nmake it work.\n\n1751\n01:26:51,292 --> 01:26:54,260\nBut maybe I'll look at it and\nsay, you know what?\n\n1752\n01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:55,510\nI just don't use it enough.\n\n1753\n01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:56,510\nLet's just get rid of it.\n\n1754\n01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:57,890\nAnd so maybe I do that.\n\n1755\n01:26:57,890 --> 01:26:59,680\nAnd now I don't worry about\nthe application at all,\n\n1756\n01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,680\nwhich is probably what I'm inclined to do.\n\n1757\n01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,400\nCuz I don't use that\napplication all that often.\n\n1758\n01:27:04,882 --> 01:27:06,493\nAll right, so\nthose are some of the things,\n\n1759\n01:27:06,493 --> 01:27:09,060\nthe tools that we've got available\nto us inside of the system.\n\n1760\n01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:13,570\nJust remember activity monitor is\ngreat for locating who the problem is.\n\n1761\n01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:18,155\nAnd then the Console is great for\nfinding out what the actual cause was,\n\n1762\n01:27:18,155 --> 01:27:20,400\nwhat actually happened that wrong.\n\n1763\n01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:24,630\nOh, and in fact,\nI didn't even look at the Spotlight stuff.\n\n1764\n01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:27,730\nDid I have a Spotlight log file?\n\n1765\n01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:28,720\nWe'll see if I got one.\n\n1766\n01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:31,740\nSo, looking under user diagnostic\nreports I don't see Spotlight.\n\n1767\n01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:33,390\nIf I look under System Diagnostics,\n\n1768\n01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:36,770\nlet's make this window a little\nbit bigger for me here.\n\n1769\n01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:42,080\nUnder System Diagnostics we've\ngot all sorts of entries in here.\n\n1770\n01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,592\nI'm just looking to see if any\nof these indicate Spotlight.\n\n1771\n01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:47,314\nSpotlight is an Apple utility,\nso I'm kinda looking for\n\n1772\n01:27:47,314 --> 01:27:50,034\nanything that's tied to the Apple name.\n\n1773\n01:27:50,034 --> 01:27:52,643\nThose are some of my virtual\nmachines that have run,\n\n1774\n01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:55,443\nlooks like I crash my virtual\nmachines pretty regular.\n\n1775\n01:27:55,443 --> 01:28:02,860\nSo I see some web content CPU,\nany of these dated today?\n\n1776\n01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:08,660\nNope, nothing dated today so nothing crazy\nindicating there, but you'll come in and\n\n1777\n01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:11,710\nfind various things that indicate\nwhat that problem might have been.\n\n1778\n01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:14,870\nYou're looking for one that's tied to the\napplication that was giving you problems.\n\n1779\n01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:16,210\nI'm not seeing anything offhand.\n\n1780\n01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,870\nDon't be surprised about that either.\n\n1781\n01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:21,940\nIf an application is malfunctioning,\n\n1782\n01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:25,120\nit might not be generating log\nfiles because it's malfunctioning.\n\n1783\n01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,760\nSo you might not have much to go on, but\n\n1784\n01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,070\nyou can definitely peruse through\nthese final sorts of stuff.\n\n1785\n01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:34,660\nHere's more information on\nthat ex-clipboard failure.\n\n1786\n01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:37,896\nSo you can start to poke through and\nmaybe find out what that problem is.\n\n1787\n01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:40,437\nIt just depends on the applications.\n\n1788\n01:28:40,437 --> 01:28:45,750\nAll right, well, the only other thing that\nI wanna mention to be aware of on the exam\n\n1789\n01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:51,390\nis that when you run an application,\nby default, the application runs as you.\n\n1790\n01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:54,510\nSo I'm logged into this\ncomputer as dpezet, so\n\n1791\n01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:56,060\nwhen I run a program, like here.\n\n1792\n01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:59,840\nI'll launch, what's something that's easy,\nlike Calendar.\n\n1793\n01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,570\nSo if I fire up my calendar, or\nWrite, my little text editor.\n\n1794\n01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:07,050\nWhen I fire up Write,\nit's running as me, as dpezet, and so\n\n1795\n01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,650\nit gets the same permissions that I do.\n\n1796\n01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:13,460\nAnd when we're in the activity monitor,\nand I look at the applications they're\n\n1797\n01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:18,260\nrunning, I can sort it by user, and I can\nsee all the things that dpezet is running.\n\n1798\n01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:21,910\nAnd somewhere in here, I should be\nable to find that Write application,\n\n1799\n01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:24,350\nwhich should be running as me.\n\n1800\n01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:26,950\nAnd so I'm just looking in\nhere trying to find it.\n\n1801\n01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:28,710\nApparently it's buried in, there it is.\n\n1802\n01:29:28,710 --> 01:29:29,680\nRight.\n\n1803\n01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,810\nNow, there's that write application,\nit's running as me.\n\n1804\n01:29:31,810 --> 01:29:34,970\nIt says it's not responding, but\nit's actually working just fine.\n\n1805\n01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:37,580\nBut I can see it, it's running,\nand it show it's running as me.\n\n1806\n01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:38,500\nThat's what I expect to see.\n\n1807\n01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:45,220\nBut, there are sometimes when you run an\napplication and it runs as somebody else.\n\n1808\n01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,590\nUnderneath the hood in Mac OS,\nwe have the BSD operating system,\n\n1809\n01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:51,600\nwhich is based on Unix.\n\n1810\n01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:56,090\nIn Unix, there's a special\nfile flag called the SUID.\n\n1811\n01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:57,560\nIf any files or\n\n1812\n01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:02,420\napp has been flagged with SUID flag,\nwhen it runs, it will run as root.\n\n1813\n01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:08,240\nSo don't be surprised if you look in here\nand you see some things running as root.\n\n1814\n01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:10,850\nThat means they're running as the system.\n\n1815\n01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:15,110\nAnd there's certain applications, usually\ndrivers, that have to run as the system.\n\n1816\n01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:18,310\nThey have to run as that underlying,\nhigh-admin account, and\n\n1817\n01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:20,050\nthey'll run as root.\n\n1818\n01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:24,110\nBut, if you see an application in there\nthat you didn't approve, that you didn't\n\n1819\n01:30:24,110 --> 01:30:27,970\ninstall yourself, that's a great indicator\nthat your system's been compromised.\n\n1820\n01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:32,060\nThat somebody is running\nan application not as they should be.\n\n1821\n01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:32,630\nRight?\n\n1822\n01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:34,610\nSo mine looks pretty clean.\n\n1823\n01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:38,810\nI don't see anything jumping out at me\nhere that shouldn't be run as root,\n\n1824\n01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:42,430\nbut you'll see things in here like\nthe Logitech software that I added.\n\n1825\n01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:44,810\nThat will be running\nSUID in the background.\n\n1826\n01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:47,470\nNo matter what user logs\nin on the computer,\n\n1827\n01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:50,740\nthat needs to run as root because it's\ninteracting with hardware on the computer.\n\n1828\n01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:52,660\nIt's not tied to a particular user.\n\n1829\n01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:56,410\nOur applications, though,\nthose are tied to us as a user, and\n\n1830\n01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:59,420\nthey run with our permission, so\nthat's what we expect to see.\n\n1831\n01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:02,260\nAll right.\n\n1832\n01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:05,670\nI've got all sorts of random applications\nsaying they're not responding.\n\n1833\n01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:09,245\nThis is turning out to be a good\ntroubleshooting instance, so\n\n1834\n01:31:09,245 --> 01:31:11,940\n[LAUGH] sometimes you get that, right.\n\n1835\n01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:12,900\nIt's kind of jumping all over the place.\n\n1836\n01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,490\nI can see Write is showing\nup as healthy now.\n\n1837\n01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:16,690\nSo, strange stuff.\n\n1838\n01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:19,210\nAll right.\nWell those are some of the utilities that\n\n1839\n01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:20,300\nare built into the system.\n\n1840\n01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:21,310\nKind of a quick view of them.\n\n1841\n01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:24,410\nI can't think of anything else\nworth mentioning on that, so\n\n1842\n01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:27,230\nthis is probably a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap this episode up.\n\n1843\n01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:28,420\nAll right.\n\n1844\n01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:29,860\nWell let me remind you

--> 00:00:40,610\nFor another episode of\nITProTV I'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,662\nBack in with another episode of Apple\ncertified support professional.\n\n5\n00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:47,126\nWe're gonna be diving into\na new objective area today.\n\n6\n00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:51,010\nIt is 6.0 or part 6,\nhowever you want to call it\n\n7\n00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,010\nNetwork configuration,and this is an area\nthat is really important today because it\n\n8\n00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,480\nis a rare rare computer that\nisn't connected to a network.\n\n9\n00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,470\nAnd you might not have other\ncomputers on the network with you.\n\n10\n00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,090\nYou might just use Internet access which\nmeans you are connected the largest\n\n11\n00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,690\nnetwork in the world.\n\n12\n00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,930\nAnd that's just a given, right?\n\n13\n00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,450\nA computer without Internet access\nthese days is like a car without gas.\n\n14\n00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,140\nWe expect to have that access.\n\n15\n00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,920\nWe need to be able to set up and\nget configured for it.\n\n16\n00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,510\nFortunately, Mac OS is a full\nnetwork operating system.\n\n17\n00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,370\nIt wasn't always like that,\nall right, back in the old OS 9 and\n\n18\n00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,250\nOS 8 days, the operating system back then,\nit had networking support, but\n\n19\n00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,650\nit wasn't built in as the original\nidea for the operating system.\n\n20\n00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,900\nThe original Apples were designed\nto be standalone units, and\n\n21\n00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,700\nthey added networking\nkinda as an afterthought.\n\n22\n00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,800\nWell, with OS 10, when we became OS X,\n\n23\n00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,510\nright, that's when they switched to\nhaving a Unix BSD core under the hood.\n\n24\n00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,980\nAnd that operating system was designed,\n\n25\n00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,220\nas a network operating\nsystem from the beginning.\n\n26\n00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,040\nAnd what that means is that now\nwe benefit from that, right?\n\n27\n00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,790\nThat Mac OS is a fully functional network\noperating system that is very powerful.\n\n28\n00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,700\nIt can be an excellent client.\n\n29\n00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,760\nAs well as a server.\n\n30\n00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,730\nThere's a lot of stuff\nthat's located inside of it.\n\n31\n00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,270\nWell, in this episode we're focused\nmore on just basic connectivity.\n\n32\n00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,730\nWe're gonna have another episode coming\nup which is gonna be our network services\n\n33\n00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,110\nwhere we're focused on all the different\nlittle things we can provide on a network,\n\n34\n00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,590\nbut as far as basic connectivity, there's\ntwo main areas we need to worry about.\n\n35\n00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,210\nThere's physical connectivity,\nhow we connect our Mac\n\n36\n00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,310\nphysically to whatever network it\nis that we're gonna be on, and\n\n37\n00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,900\nthen there's logical connectivity,\nthe addressing that we use,\n\n38\n00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,019\nthe protocols that we use to\ncommunicate between two computers.\n\n39\n00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,860\nWe need to take a look at some\nof those different pieces.\n\n40\n00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,220\nOn the physical side, most of us are gonna\nbe connecting to a network via wireless,\n\n41\n00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,290\nright, like 802-11 a,\n\n42\n00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,190\nb, g, n, a, c, whatever standard is\nout when you guys watch this episode.\n\n43\n00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,640\nThat's how we're gonna connect\nto a wireless network which\n\n44\n00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,660\ndoesn't involve wires.\n\n45\n00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,700\nBut, thus the wireless name, I guess.\n\n46\n00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,530\nBut it is still considered\na physical connection medium.\n\n47\n00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,130\nWe're connecting to that network\nvia RF waves, radio frequency.\n\n48\n00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,390\nThe other option,\nis to do a copper based connection.\n\n49\n00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,880\nRight?\nWhere we plug in via a network cable of\n\n50\n00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,820\nsome sort.\n\n51\n00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,030\nAnd that's usually common\nif you have a desktop.\n\n52\n00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,650\nIf you're trying to do something that\nrequires a constant network connection,\n\n53\n00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,070\nthat's very reliable, you'll normally\nuse a physical network cable.\n\n54\n00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,770\nWell apple devices, laptops,\ndesktops, they support all of that.\n\n55\n00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,800\nWe can do wired and wireless.\n\n56\n00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,300\nThat's easy.\n\n57\n00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,890\nOnce we connect to that network though.\n\n58\n00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,230\nNow we need to deal with\nthe logical side of things.\n\n59\n00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,630\nAnd on the logical side,\n\n60\n00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,440\nmost networks that are out there\nare going to run IP version four.\n\n61\n00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,670\nInternet Protocol version four, all right.\n\n62\n00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,013\nAnd we normally here\nrefered to it as TCPIP.\n\n63\n00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:47,110\nBut TCPIP,\nthat's actually two different protocols,\n\n64\n00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,390\ntransmission control protocol and\nInternet protocol.\n\n65\n00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,970\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthose in this episode.\n\n66\n00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,080\nMake sure we have a good\nunderstanding of what they are.\n\n67\n00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,538\nBut for right now,\nlet's just think about IPv4.\n\n68\n00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:01,128\nIPv4, that's\nthe Internet Protocol Version 4,\n\n69\n00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:05,350\nit's the most common network\nprotocol on the planet.\n\n70\n00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,460\nIt is a open protocol so\nany vendor can support it and that means,\n\n71\n00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,880\nif your Mac is running IPB4 and\nthere's a Linux machine running IPB4 and\n\n72\n00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,970\na Windows machine running IPB4,\nand a refrigerator\n\n73\n00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,220\nrunning IPB4 they can all talk to\neach other cuz the common protocol.\n\n74\n00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,922\nThat makes it very attractive so\na lot of devices support it,\n\n75\n00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:29,580\nnow IPv4 has some problems I'll talk\nabout a little bit later, but it's being\n\n76\n00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,490\nreplaced with IPv6 and Mac OS was one of\nthe first operating systems to provide\n\n77\n00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,250\nreally good vendor support for IPv6.\n\n78\n00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,050\nApple got behind IPv6 pretty early on.\n\n79\n00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,140\nAnd so we have good support for\nthat in here too.\n\n80\n00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,040\nIt's a lot less common than IPv4, but\nit is out there and over the next five to\n\n81\n00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,920\nten years, we'll see people migrating\nover to it and eventually replacing IPv4.\n\n82\n00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,470\nBut those aren't the only protocols.\n\n83\n00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,980\nThere's other protocols\nthat our Mac supports.\n\n84\n00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,520\nThings like NetBios,\n\n85\n00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,510\nwhich is an old Windows protocol that\nwe can use to communicate with them.\n\n86\n00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,980\nThere's Bonjour, which we'll learn about\nlater on, which is an Apple type protocol.\n\n87\n00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,600\nThere's Apple file-sharing or\nApple File Protocol, AFP.\n\n88\n00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,040\nThere's a bunch of other different\nprotocols that stack on to allow us\n\n89\n00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,100\nto communicate.\n\n90\n00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,380\nBut under the hood most of our\ncommunication is gonna happen with IPv4,\n\n91\n00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:21,890\nor IPv6, right?\n\n92\n00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,410\nAnother one that I wanna mention, I don't\nthink it'll turn up on the exam, but\n\n93\n00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,430\nyour Mac still has support for things\nlike PPP, the Point-to-Point Protocol.\n\n94\n00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,740\nSome of you, if you're younger, you might\nnot remember this, but if you're over 30,\n\n95\n00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,290\nyou probably remember having to dial up\nvia phone line to connect to the Internet.\n\n96\n00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,540\nMaybe that was via AOL or\nportage, or a local ISP but\n\n97\n00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,000\nyou dialed up via a phone line to connect.\n\n98\n00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,300\nWell, regular protocols like IPv4 aren't\ndesigned to go over a phone line, and\n\n99\n00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,560\nso we had to leverage a special protocol\ncalled PPP, Point to- Point Protocol,\n\n100\n00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,490\nto be able to hide or encapsulated our\nIPv4 traffic, send it across the phone\n\n101\n00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,760\nline, and your Internet service\nprovider could then unencapsulate it,\n\n102\n00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,730\nto release it on the network\non the other end.\n\n103\n00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,200\nThat protocol is still supported.\n\n104\n00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,790\nIf you still need to connect via modem,\nyou can.\n\n105\n00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,510\nNow, I can't think of a single\nMac sold today that actually has\n\n106\n00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,720\nan analog modem in it, so you'd have\nto get like an external analog modem,\n\n107\n00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,680\nor USB modem to hook up and use it.\n\n108\n00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,300\nBut you still can,\nthose protocols are still there.\n\n109\n00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,090\nNo reason for Apple to remove them so\nthey leave them.\n\n110\n00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,300\nIt's not as prominent as they use to be.\n\n111\n00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,640\nWe don't see them in a lot of\nthe menus but they are there.\n\n112\n00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,440\nWell, I mentioned TCPIP.\n\n113\n00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,390\nBefore we start diving into\na lot of this stuff too crazy,\n\n114\n00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,530\nI wanna spend some time on what TCPIP is,\nand how it functions all right.\n\n115\n00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,390\nTCPIP is the most common protocol that's\nused and when we say TCPIP we're typically\n\n116\n00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:53,310\nreferring to IP version four right so\nthe most common protocol mechanism or\n\n117\n00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,340\ncommunication that we can use that's out\nthere and what its designed to do is to\n\n118\n00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:02,600\nfacilitate, two computers finding\neach other and talking, right?\n\n119\n00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,800\nIf you have two computers that are right\non the same network, they're local.\n\n120\n00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,560\nThey can talk directly to each other.\n\n121\n00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,360\nThere's no big deal.\n\n122\n00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:14,505\nWhat if one computer is here\nat the IT Pro TV studio, and\n\n123\n00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:17,245\nthe other computer is right there\nat the desk in front of you?\n\n124\n00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:20,925\nWell, we may be separated\nby 100 of 1000's of miles.\n\n125\n00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:25,677\nWe may be separated by huge amounts\nof Internet infrastructure.\n\n126\n00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:31,007\nHow do our two computers find each other,\nwell, that's where IPv4\n\n127\n00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:35,137\nkicks in IPv4 uses a hierarchical\naddressing structure that allows us to\n\n128\n00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:39,467\ndefine networks and then be able to find\nthose networks if we need to get at them.\n\n129\n00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:42,067\nAnd it's designed to scale very large.\n\n130\n00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:44,237\nNow, I say it's designed\nto scale very large.\n\n131\n00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:46,570\nThat's actually one of\nthe problems we have with IPv4.\n\n132\n00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,450\nIt's designed the scale very large.\n\n133\n00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,392\nBut not large enough, okay.\n\n134\n00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:55,293\nLet's talk a little bit about the IPv4\naddresses and I'll show you what I mean.\n\n135\n00:07:55,293 --> 00:08:00,342\nLet me just bring up like a notepad Window\nhere, and I'll show you guys an example.\n\n136\n00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:03,802\nWhen I have a computer that's\noperating on an IPv4 network,\n\n137\n00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:06,940\nit will have an address that\nlooks something like this.\n\n138\n00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,218\nI might have 192.168.0.1.\n\n139\n00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:17,584\nOr I might have 172.16.5.23 or\n\n140\n00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:23,277\n209.251.159.188.\n\n141\n00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:25,770\nSomething of that nature.\n\n142\n00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:30,590\nAn IPv4 is written in what's\ncalled a dotted decimal notation.\n\n143\n00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,930\nIt's broken into four pieces.\n\n144\n00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,430\nSo, I've got a number here,\n192, and a dot, and\n\n145\n00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,280\nthen a 168, and a dot, and\na 0, and a dot, and a 1.\n\n146\n00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,980\nSo, it's written as dotted decimal.\n\n147\n00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,630\nWell, that's how we see it as humans,\n\n148\n00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,670\nbecause when it's written this way\nit's somewhat easy to remember.\n\n149\n00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,210\nThe maximum amount of the numbers\nwe would have in there is 12, and\n\n150\n00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,210\n12 numbers people can handle.\n\n151\n00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,330\nWe remember ten digit phone numbers pretty\neasy, and it's just two extra digits.\n\n152\n00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:01,180\nSo, people can remember these IP addresses\npretty easily written the way they are.\n\n153\n00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,980\nBut your computer doesn't\nwanna see it this way.\n\n154\n00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,950\nYour computer will see it as binary.\n\n155\n00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:13,040\nAnd when we write an IPv4 address in\nbinary, it's actually a 32-bit number.\n\n156\n00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,654\nIt's a 32-bit binary number\nthe way the system writes it.\n\n157\n00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:20,918\nSo if I were to take 192.168.0.1 for\nexample, and\n\n158\n00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:25,100\nconvert that to binary,\nthis is what it's gonna look like.\n\n159\n00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,430\nLet me see if I can do this in my head.\n\n160\n00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,710\nI have mixed results when I do this\nstuff in my head sometimes, so\n\n161\n00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,970\nlet me just double check [LAUGH] here.\n\n162\n00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,828\nI'm not as good as a calculator.\n\n163\n00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:38,613\nThere we go.\n\n164\n00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:39,252\nAll right.\nSo\n\n165\n00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:44,040\nthat's what 192.168.0.1\nlooks like in binary.\n\n166\n00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,230\nAnd I put the dots in there to\nrepresent where the separation is.\n\n167\n00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,589\nSo like 192 written in binary 1100,00,00.\n\n168\n00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:55,275\nBut the dots are there\nto help us as humans, so\n\n169\n00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:57,550\nthe computer doesn't even see that.\n\n170\n00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,329\nWhen the computer looks at this,\n\n171\n00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:05,600\nit actually sees it without the dots,\nas just 32 1s and 0s.\n\n172\n00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:12,970\nWell, 32 1s and 0s, that's how many bits\nI have available to write this address or\n\n173\n00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,520\nnetwork ID, or whatever to get\nout there and form my systems.\n\n174\n00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,170\nIf you started with all\nzeros at the bottom,\n\n175\n00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,090\nthat would be the lowest number that I\ncould write, it would be just all zeros.\n\n176\n00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,850\nThe highest number that I\ncan write would be all ones.\n\n177\n00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,940\nSo I've got an upper and a lower\nceiling here for my IPv4 addresses.\n\n178\n00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,720\nSo that means I have a limited\nnumber of addresses available.\n\n179\n00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,010\nFortunately that number is really big.\n\n180\n00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,678\nI've actually got it written down on\na little notepad over here on my side, so\n\n181\n00:10:41,678 --> 00:10:42,632\nI'm gonna write this out.\n\n182\n00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:46,265\nI always just remember that it's\nroughly 4.3 billion addresses.\n\n183\n00:10:46,265 --> 00:10:54,380\nBut it's 4,294,967,295 addresses.\n\n184\n00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,470\nThat's how big the IPv4 address pool is.\n\n185\n00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,840\nSo if we were to go to every computer and\nstart assigning one address to\n\n186\n00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,660\nevery computer,\nwe could do 4.3 billion computers.\n\n187\n00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,396\nNow, back when IPv4 was created,\nthis was in the 1970s,\n\n188\n00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:14,216\n4.3 billion computers was\na number that was inconceivable.\n\n189\n00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:17,650\nThey never thought there\nwould be that many computers.\n\n190\n00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,210\nComputers at the time were still very\nexpensive, they were very large.\n\n191\n00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,360\nAnd it was just computers.\n\n192\n00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,830\nNobody ever anticipated computers\nbecoming much, much smaller.\n\n193\n00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,790\nMuch, much less expensive.\n\n194\n00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,790\nAnd more than just computers\nusers in the network.\n\n195\n00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:38,020\nWe got cell phones, tablets,\ntelevisions, VCRs, well not VCRs.\n\n196\n00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,820\nMaybe like Blu Ray players.\n\n197\n00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,455\nAll these devices\nconnecting to the internet.\n\n198\n00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:44,520\nThey all need addresses to talk.\n\n199\n00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,430\nWell, if you look at that number,\n4.3 billion,\n\n200\n00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:53,420\nthere's a little over 6 billion\npeople on the planet today, right?\n\n201\n00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,850\nSo, just based on one person having one\nIP, there's not enough IP's available.\n\n202\n00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,820\nThere's not enough addresses.\n\n203\n00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,350\nBut it gets even worse when there's people\nlike me that have a bunch of addresses.\n\n204\n00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,160\nI've got a phone, a tablet,\na laptop, a desktop,\n\n205\n00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,655\nI'm consuming more IP's than just one.\n\n206\n00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:17,245\nSo there's not enough addresses and\nthat's the big problem with IPv4.\n\n207\n00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:20,315\nSo it is the most common\nprotocol in the world.\n\n208\n00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:23,555\nIt is most likely the one you're\nusing right now to watch this show.\n\n209\n00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:27,115\nIt's definitely the one I'm using right\nnow to communicate with you guys.\n\n210\n00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:29,980\nSo, it is the most popular.\n\n211\n00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,190\nBut the death knell has been sounded.\n\n212\n00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,610\nThe timer is ticking on it.\n\n213\n00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,070\nThere is an end coming for\n\n214\n00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,630\nIPv4 and it's coming soon, really in\nthe next probably five to seven years,\n\n215\n00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,560\nis where we'll see that big push\nto get us moved over into IPv6.\n\n216\n00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,120\nIPv6 fixes this problem by making\na much larger address space.\n\n217\n00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,220\nIPv6.\nSo this is IPv4 right here.\n\n218\n00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:04,340\nSo the IPv4 address base is\naround 4.3 billion addresses.\n\n219\n00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,110\nWell IPv6, I've got its number\ntucked away in here somewhere.\n\n220\n00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,205\nLets see if I can find it, right here.\n\n221\n00:13:13,537 --> 00:13:17,690\nThis number is big.\n\n222\n00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,560\nIt's a number that most of us\ncan't even fathom in our minds.\n\n223\n00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,400\nIn the IPv6 address space,\nit doesn't use a 32-bit number.\n\n224\n00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,041\nIt uses 128-bit number.\n\n225\n00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:32,400\nA number that is significantly\nlarger than this.\n\n226\n00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,858\nIt's four times the size of\nthe number of an IPv4 address.\n\n227\n00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:42,890\nAnd it creates 340 undecillion addresses.\n\n228\n00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,630\nAnd that's a meaningless name,\nundecillion,\n\n229\n00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,790\nnobody even knows what that is.\n\n230\n00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,030\nIn our minds we can't fathom that.\n\n231\n00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,010\nSo let's put it into\nterms that we can fathom.\n\n232\n00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,120\nRemember this IPv4 address space where I\nsaid there were 4.3 billion addresses.\n\n233\n00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,010\nWell, on Earth right now let's just\nsay that there are 6 billion people.\n\n234\n00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:06,650\nIn IPv6 I could give everyone of those 6\nbillion people, so all 6 billion people,\n\n235\n00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:11,150\nI could give everyone of them 4.3\nbillion addresses of their own.\n\n236\n00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:16,640\nYou could give every person on the planet\nan entire IPv4 space just for them.\n\n237\n00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,420\nThis is a massive number.\n\n238\n00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,300\nNow that's exactly what they\nthought back in the 1970s.\n\n239\n00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,730\nSo right now it's a massive number.\n\n240\n00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,810\nBut 20 years from now, when we've\npopulated other planets and whatever,\n\n241\n00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,100\nthey're gonna look at that and go, oh man,\nwe only have an undecillion addresses.\n\n242\n00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,030\nWe need more.\n\n243\n00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,640\nAnd so there'll be something new.\n\n244\n00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,510\nBut this should last us a while, right?\n\n245\n00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,690\nAnd that's the plan with IPv6.\n\n246\n00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,560\nWe do make a bit of a sacrifice.\n\n247\n00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,640\nWith IPv6 the number is so big it\nbecomes something we can't remember.\n\n248\n00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:53,750\nWhen I look at 192.168.0.1, sure that's\nnot a very meaningful number to me.\n\n249\n00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,470\nThere's no pattern in there that\nwill help me remember that.\n\n250\n00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,080\nBut it's not that bad, right?\n\n251\n00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,770\nIt's only so many numbers.\n\n252\n00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,395\nBut an IPv6 address is big, 128-bits.\n\n253\n00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,600\nAnd so when they write those addresses,\n\n254\n00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,460\nthey actually write them in\nwhat's called hexadecimal.\n\n255\n00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:14,500\nWhen we talk about decimal, decimal is\nwhat we all learned in grade school and\n\n256\n00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:21,130\nwhat it uses, it uses digits\nmade up of zero through nine.\n\n257\n00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,330\nSo if I start counting,\nI go from zero to nine.\n\n258\n00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,890\nAnd when I get to ten I go to two digits.\n\n259\n00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,620\nAnd then each of those\ncan be zero through nine.\n\n260\n00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,898\nAnd then I go to three digits,\nzero through nine and so on.\n\n261\n00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:37,796\nSo each one has a value of ten,\nso it's 2 to the 10th power,\n\n262\n00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:43,090\nif we were to go a little mathematical,\nor base 10 mathematics.\n\n263\n00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,999\nSo that's what we normally use.\n\n264\n00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,600\nLet me just write this in a way\nthat's a little more sensible there.\n\n265\n00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,656\nBinary, what we just saw is, let's see,\n\n266\n00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:03,720\nbinary used digits made up of zero and\none.\n\n267\n00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,970\nThat's it, just two values, zero and one.\n\n268\n00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,352\nIt's two.\n\n269\n00:16:08,352 --> 00:16:12,140\nTo the second power, and\nit's base two mathematics.\n\n270\n00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,660\nHexadecimal goes crazy though.\n\n271\n00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,618\nHexadecimal uses digits\n\n272\n00:16:21,618 --> 00:16:27,390\nmade up of 0-9 and A-F.\n\n273\n00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,288\nNow why A-F?\nWell,\n\n274\n00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,536\nhexadecimal is actually\ntwo to the 16th power.\n\n275\n00:16:31,536 --> 00:16:33,470\nOr Base 16 mathematics.\n\n276\n00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:38,830\nWe need 16 values,\n0-9 that's ten values, I need six more.\n\n277\n00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,400\nIt goes A-F.\n\n278\n00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,150\nWhere A represents ten, and\nB represents 11, C represents 12,\n\n279\n00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,070\nD represents 13 and\nI sorta lose track in my head.\n\n280\n00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,940\nAnd you get to F, which represents 16.\n\n281\n00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,050\nEach of those represents a higher number.\n\n282\n00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,588\nWhen we look at an ITv6 address,\n\n283\n00:16:56,588 --> 00:17:02,698\nI might see an address that's written out\na lot more complex than an IPv4 address.\n\n284\n00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:07,999\nFor example, Apple's website Apple's own\n\n285\n00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:12,915\nwebsite which is just www.apple.com.\n\n286\n00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:14,575\nThat address right there.\n\n287\n00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,835\nNow it has multiple addresses.and\nI'm gonna use the addresses\n\n288\n00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:21,395\nthat I looked up here from the IT PRO TV\nstudio, you might actually\n\n289\n00:17:21,395 --> 00:17:25,165\nget different addresses where you're at\ncuz Apple has servers all over the world.\n\n290\n00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:30,710\nBut if I wanted to use just\nan example Apple, their IP address,\n\n291\n00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,340\nwell let me go and find that.\n\n292\n00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:39,239\nOh actually what,\nI think I've got it written down,\n\n293\n00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:46,210\nyes I do their IPv4\naddress is 23.78.138.214.\n\n294\n00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,160\nThat's the IP address of\nApple's website for IPv4.\n\n295\n00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,330\nThey have an IPv6 address also.\n\n296\n00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,666\nAnd the IPv6 address is 128 bits long.\n\n297\n00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,604\nIt's written in hexadecimal.\n\n298\n00:17:58,604 --> 00:18:04,820\nAnd when they write it into hexadecimal,\nthey break it up into eight sections.\n\n299\n00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,630\nWe had four sections up there for our IPv4\naddress, here's gonna have eight sections.\n\n300\n00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,888\nAnd Apple's IPv6 address,\n\n301\n00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:23,262\nis 2600:1402:14:197:0:0:0:c77.\n\n302\n00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:23,970\nThere.\n\n303\n00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,400\nAll right, that's their IPv6 address.\n\n304\n00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,461\nFor their website all right notice\nits significantly longer, and\n\n305\n00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:34,068\nits got letters in it here's a letter C\nright actually its only got one letter in\n\n306\n00:18:34,068 --> 00:18:37,568\nit that's unusual normally they have\na little more then that but all right so\n\n307\n00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:39,226\nits only got one letter in it and so.\n\n308\n00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:40,966\nI can see that address right there,\n\n309\n00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:44,794\nits much longer much harder to remember\nyou can't remember that I wrote it down\n\n310\n00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:48,650\nbefore the show cuz there was no\nchance I was gonna memorize that.\n\n311\n00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,570\nIPv6 addresses are big.\n\n312\n00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,070\nRight?\n\n313\n00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,870\nAs a result, we don't want to deal\nwith them if we don't have to.\n\n314\n00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,610\nWe don't even really want to\ndeal with IPv4 addresses,\n\n315\n00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,230\nif we don't have to, right?\n\n316\n00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,290\nWhy memorize these address\nif we don't need to?\n\n317\n00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:07,090\nApple has gone to great lengths to make\nsure that we never have to deal with that,\n\n318\n00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,795\nin fact, most end users,\nmost people who use a Mac.\n\n319\n00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:12,710\nDon't even know these\naddresses are happening.\n\n320\n00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,450\nThey plug in that network cable,\nand they're just able to work and\n\n321\n00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,480\nit's all hidden from them.\n\n322\n00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,700\nAnd that's great, right?\n\n323\n00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,530\nThat works great for them,\nand that's kind of the point.\n\n324\n00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,290\nYou want to make stuff easy, but if you're\ngonna be a technician supporting these\n\n325\n00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,260\nMacs and something doesn't work,\nyou've got to know what's going on under\n\n326\n00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,370\nthe hood, so you've got to have\nan understanding of this, all right?\n\n327\n00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,980\nNow if you have absolutely no background\nin networking, if you've never dealt with\n\n328\n00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,420\nnetworking at all, I really encourage you\nto jump over to our Network Plus show.\n\n329\n00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:44,594\nIn the Network Plus Show, we have\na series of IPv4 and IPv6 episodes.\n\n330\n00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:47,550\nI think it was like eight\ntotal episodes altogether.\n\n331\n00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,380\nWhere we go in-depth on how these work,\nhow they function, exactly what's going on\n\n332\n00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,940\nbehind the scenes, because it's the same\nfor Windows, for Mac, for Unix.\n\n333\n00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,730\nThe protocol's the same for all of them.\n\n334\n00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,670\nIt's a common protocol.\n\n335\n00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,000\nThat one show we really cover them all,\nall kinda wrapped into one,\n\n336\n00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,610\nand it's really good stuff.\n\n337\n00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,470\nRemember as an IT Pro TV subscriber,\nyou have access to all of that.\n\n338\n00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,750\nYou can just jump right over to\nNetwork Plus, and catch those episodes.\n\n339\n00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,950\nDefinitely great for\ngetting all the background.\n\n340\n00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,071\nBut what I'm gonna do here in this\nepisode is cover what's important for\n\n341\n00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:20,488\nthe exam, to make sure we know\nwhat we need for the ACSP.\n\n342\n00:20:20,488 --> 00:20:23,825\nAnd the primary thing that\nwe need to understand,\n\n343\n00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:27,330\nis that the address is\nactually made up of two parts.\n\n344\n00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,270\nOne part is the network ID.\n\n345\n00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,900\nAnd the other part is the host ID.\n\n346\n00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,160\nThis address is actually\nbroken into two pieces.\n\n347\n00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,370\nThe network ID, is what's telling\nus what network we're on and\n\n348\n00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,750\nthe host ID is telling\nus what host we're on.\n\n349\n00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,010\nWhat individual computer we're on.\n\n350\n00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,130\nThink of it like a street address.\n\n351\n00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:55,272\nThe building I'm in right now\nis 6933 NW Fourth Boulevard.\n\n352\n00:20:55,272 --> 00:20:57,510\nAll right, that's the building\nthat I'm sitting in right now,\n\n353\n00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,730\nor standing in, right now.\n\n354\n00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,420\nThat street address,\nis made of two pieces, right?\n\n355\n00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,960\nWe've got a building ID and\na street ID, all right?\n\n356\n00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,342\nThe building is 6933.\n\n357\n00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:14,688\nAll right, there's a building right\nnext to that might be 6931 or\n\n358\n00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:16,572\non the other side, 6935, right?\n\n359\n00:21:16,572 --> 00:21:21,050\nThey each have a street number or\nstreet ID.\n\n360\n00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:24,600\nAnd then after that, is my street name,\nNorthwest Fourth Boulevard.\n\n361\n00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,320\nThere's other buildings on\nNorthwest Fourth Boulevard.\n\n362\n00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,863\nSo for example.\n\n363\n00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:34,202\nThe ones I mentioned,\n6935 Northwest Fourth Boulevard.\n\n364\n00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:37,041\n6-9-3.\n\n365\n00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,330\nWell it could really be any number.\n\n366\n00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,600\nIt could be 55 Northwest Fourth Boulevard.\n\n367\n00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,070\nWhen I look at these numbers,\nand these names.\n\n368\n00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,590\nWhen I see\nNorthwest Fourth Boulevard I know.\n\n369\n00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,030\nThose buildings are on\nthe same street as me.\n\n370\n00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,550\nWe're on the same street.\n\n371\n00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,150\nIf I wanna drive to one\nof these other buildings,\n\n372\n00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,940\nI just get on the street right here and\nI jump right over to them.\n\n373\n00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,620\nI don't need to look up directions for\nthat, I just turn left to right and\n\n374\n00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,220\nI find that building.\n\n375\n00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,133\nDone.\nThese are the buildings that are on\n\n376\n00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:03,200\nthe same street as me.\n\n377\n00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,550\nAnd there will be no two buildings,\nwith the same building ID on this street.\n\n378\n00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:14,470\nWe are 6933, there's no other\n6933 on Northwest 4th boulevard.\n\n379\n00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,080\nRight?\n\n380\n00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,674\nWe are 6933.\n\n381\n00:22:15,674 --> 00:22:18,040\nBut there's other streets out there.\n\n382\n00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,880\nI don't know where it is,\n\n383\n00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,150\nbut I can imagine there's\na Northwest Fifth boulevard.\n\n384\n00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:22,870\nAll right?\n\n385\n00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,800\nAnd on Northwest Fifth Boulevard,\nthere might be a 6933.\n\n386\n00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,410\nOn a different street.\n\n387\n00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,800\nAnd I know if I want to go\nto visit that building,\n\n388\n00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,940\nI might need to look up some directions\ncuz I don't know where Fifth Boulevard is.\n\n389\n00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,510\nI'm gonna begin on\nNorthwest Forth Boulevard, my road,\n\n390\n00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,290\nand make some turns to get there.\n\n391\n00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,830\nWell, that's exactly how\nyour IP addresses work.\n\n392\n00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,310\nPart of this address.\n\n393\n00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:51,350\nIs going to represent your network ID,\nand part of it represents your host ID.\n\n394\n00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,150\nIf you have two hosts on the same network,\nthey can talk directly to each other.\n\n395\n00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,060\nThey just reach right out on\nthe network and talk to each other.\n\n396\n00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,720\nBut if the network ID is different,\nif they're on a different network,\n\n397\n00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,390\nyou're gonna have to go through a router.\n\n398\n00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,560\nYou'll have a router on your network that\nwill help get you to your destination.\n\n399\n00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:14,500\nThat's one of the primary purposes of\nan IP address is making sure we know\n\n400\n00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,310\nwhen a computer is on our network or if\nthe computer is on somebody elses network.\n\n401\n00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,140\nAnd then how to get there.\n\n402\n00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,070\nHow do we get to that\nsomebody elses network.\n\n403\n00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,150\nAnd that's where the router comes in.\n\n404\n00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:29,390\nWhen we configure IP addressing on\na system, whether it's IPv4 or IPv6,\n\n405\n00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,170\nwe're normally setting three things.\n\n406\n00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,030\nWe're setting an address,\n\n407\n00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,990\nwe're setting what's called a sub net\nmask, and we're setting a router.\n\n408\n00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,270\nThe address,\nwell that's the address of our machine.\n\n409\n00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,980\nThe IP address that our machine is using.\n\n410\n00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,770\nThe router,\nthat's the person we need to go to\n\n411\n00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,388\nwhen we're talking to someone\non a different network.\n\n412\n00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:56,536\nIf I wanna get to a different network,\nI've got to go through the router, well,\n\n413\n00:23:56,536 --> 00:24:00,633\nI only know if somebody's on a different\nnetwork if I know what my network ID is.\n\n414\n00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:04,178\nAnd I can figure that out\nusing my sub net mask.\n\n415\n00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:08,814\nNow the sub net mask is simply a number\nThat represents how many bits of my\n\n416\n00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,593\nIP address, when we look at the bits here,\n\n417\n00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:15,320\nhow many bits of that IP address\nmatch up with my network?\n\n418\n00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,820\nAnd fortunately, there's really just\nthree that get used really commonly.\n\n419\n00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,800\nThey're based on this old class\nsystem that used to exist back in\n\n420\n00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,670\nthe 70s and 80s.\n\n421\n00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,040\nIt doesn't exist anymore.\n\n422\n00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,340\nBut it's kind of stuck around as\nfar as the subnet mask that we use.\n\n423\n00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,840\nWhat you'll see is that\nwith an IPv4 address,\n\n424\n00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,340\nit'll normally be coupled with a subnet\nmask that will look something like this.\n\n425\n00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,420\nSo these are Common Subnet Masks.\n\n426\n00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:49,246\nAnd they'll look something like this,\n255.255.25.0, or 255.255.0.0.\n\n427\n00:24:49,246 --> 00:24:52,513\nOr 255.0.0.0.\n\n428\n00:24:52,513 --> 00:24:53,750\nAll right,\n\n429\n00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:58,720\nif I were to convert these to binary,\nanywhere you see 255 that's eight ones.\n\n430\n00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,700\nAnd so it's saying these eight ones here,\n\n431\n00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,150\nthese eight bits are going to be\nconsidered part of the network ID.\n\n432\n00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,260\nAnd these next eight bits, and\n\n433\n00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,010\nthese eight next bits are all going\nto be part of the network ID.\n\n434\n00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,980\nAnd when you see a zero,\nthat's gonna be eight zeroes.\n\n435\n00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,000\nAnd those eight zeroes\nare part of the host ID.\n\n436\n00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,350\nThere's something that mask is telling us.\n\n437\n00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:20,290\nWhat part of our address is our network\nand what part is the host, all right?\n\n438\n00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,680\nSo if this where my subnet mask, and\n\n439\n00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,728\nmy address was 192.168.0.1,\n\n440\n00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:35,990\nmy network would be, well,\nI've got 255, 255, 255.\n\n441\n00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:42,470\nThose first three values there,\nthose are my network.\n\n442\n00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:47,203\nSo 192.168.0.x,\nthat's my network, all right?\n\n443\n00:25:47,203 --> 00:25:53,202\nAnd my host, well,\nmy host ID would be basically x.x.x.1.\n\n444\n00:25:53,202 --> 00:25:54,144\nI'm .1.\n\n445\n00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:56,690\nI'm .1 on this network.\n\n446\n00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:04,020\nThere might be other people that are .5,\n.128, .178, 212, right?\n\n447\n00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,540\nAll the way up to 255,\nthat's where we stop.\n\n448\n00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,480\nSo, there'll be other people\nthat have other host IDs.\n\n449\n00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,400\nBut this is my network ID,\nand this is my host ID.\n\n450\n00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:15,950\nRight?\n\n451\n00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:21,300\nIf I were to take that and\nredo that with these other masks, right?\n\n452\n00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,894\nThe other masks are different.\n\n453\n00:26:24,894 --> 00:26:26,652\nObviously.\n\n454\n00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:30,012\n[LAUGH] So for this one, 255.255,\n\n455\n00:26:30,012 --> 00:26:35,965\nmy network would be 192.168 and\nmy host would actually be 0.1.\n\n456\n00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:41,968\nAnd with this last one where\nthe 255 is just in the first value,\n\n457\n00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:45,360\nmy network would be 192.\n\n458\n00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,482\nAnd my host would be 168.0.1, all right?\n\n459\n00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:53,110\nNow remember what I said earlier,\n\n460\n00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:58,510\nif I wanna talk to another computer on my\nnetwork, our network IDs need to match.\n\n461\n00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,960\nIf our network IDs match,\nwe're on the same network.\n\n462\n00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,450\nWe can talk to each other.\n\n463\n00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,120\nAll right.\n\n464\n00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,340\nBut if our network IDs don't match I'm\ngoing to have to go through a router.\n\n465\n00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:14,544\nSo if I wanted to talk to another\nhost that was 192.168.5.12.\n\n466\n00:27:14,544 --> 00:27:15,680\nAll right.\n\n467\n00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:22,650\nIn this configuration here my host ID\nis .1, my network ID is 192.168.0.\n\n468\n00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:26,895\nThe person I'm talking to,\nis their address 192.168.0 also?\n\n469\n00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,977\nNo, it's 192.168.5, it's different.\n\n470\n00:27:29,977 --> 00:27:33,048\nAnd since it's different,\nthey're not on the same network as me.\n\n471\n00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:39,070\nI have to go through a router.\n\n472\n00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:43,020\nBut if their address was 192.168.0.207,\nright?\n\n473\n00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,344\nThey start with 192.168.0.\n\n474\n00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:48,600\nMy network is 192.168.0.\n\n475\n00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,271\nI can talk to them without\ngoing through a router.\n\n476\n00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,240\nThat's what that network mask does.\n\n477\n00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,410\nAnd in this first example,\nwhere I did 192.168.5.12,\n\n478\n00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,535\nif I was using this network right here,\nright,\n\n479\n00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:07,500\n255.255.0.0, well my network\nID would be 192.168.\n\n480\n00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,481\nMy address starts with 192.168.\n\n481\n00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:13,316\nTheir address starts with 192.168.\n\n482\n00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,430\nWe're on the same network.\n\n483\n00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,610\nWe can talk without\ngoing through a router.\n\n484\n00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,410\nAll right?\n\n485\n00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,350\nWhere it really even bigger\nis this guy right here.\n\n486\n00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,010\nThis network where my network is just 192.\n\n487\n00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,230\nAnd anybody who's address\nstarted with 192,\n\n488\n00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,610\nI'd be able to talk to them\nwithout going through a router.\n\n489\n00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,120\nThat's how an IP address functions.\n\n490\n00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,760\nYou have an IP, you have a subnet mask,\nand then you have a router that you go to.\n\n491\n00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,280\nAnd the router's actually optional.\n\n492\n00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,420\nIf you're only gonna be talking\nto people on your local network,\n\n493\n00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,250\nyou don't need a router for that.\n\n494\n00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,780\nYou don't have to put it in.\n\n495\n00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,310\nYou won't be able to get to the Internet.\n\n496\n00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,680\nYou won't be able to\naccess remote networks.\n\n497\n00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,360\nBut you can leave it out.\n\n498\n00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,400\nIf you do want to access remote networks,\nthough, you've got to have a router.\n\n499\n00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,760\nThat IP address that you're gonna go to.\n\n500\n00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,340\nNow, if this is overwhelming,\n\n501\n00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,280\nI'll admit, it is a lot to take in if\nthis is your first exposure to it, and\n\n502\n00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,880\nthat's why I encourage you to jump\nover to that Network Plus show,\n\n503\n00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,260\nwhere we go really in depth on how\nthis IP addressing structure works.\n\n504\n00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,560\nBut for most people, they don't care.\n\n505\n00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,850\nAnd it's not wrong.\n\n506\n00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,910\nIt's not something you have to deal with.\n\n507\n00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,260\nMost systems are automatic.\n\n508\n00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:18,630\nSo what I want to show you next is\nhow to manually set this stuff up but\n\n509\n00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,420\nalso how to automatically set it up.\n\n510\n00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,690\nYour system can just automatically\nconfigure itself and\n\n511\n00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,980\nyou don't have to sweat it.\n\n512\n00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,020\nSo I wanna show you guys\nan example of how that works.\n\n513\n00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,240\nBut I think I've talked a little long for\nthis segment.\n\n514\n00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,130\nSo why don't we pause here and\ntake a break.\n\n515\n00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,660\nAnd when we get back, we'll get\na chance to see all of that in action.\n\n516\n00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:39,858\nStay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n517\n00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:43,413\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n518\n00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:46,990\nSo before the break I was\ntalking about IP addressing.\n\n519\n00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,770\nAnd it's kind of a dry topic so,\nlet's see it in action.\n\n520\n00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,350\nRight.\nLet's go and\n\n521\n00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,460\ntake a look at how these things function.\n\n522\n00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,280\nI've got a work station set\nup here that's got Yosemite.\n\n523\n00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,660\nAnd I'm going to basically just jump in\nand test a basic IP configuration on it.\n\n524\n00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,180\nNow to assign an IP address,\nI need to go into my System Preferences.\n\n525\n00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,190\nAnd all of my network\nsettings are buried away\n\n526\n00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:11,470\nright here in the Network\nsystem preference.\n\n527\n00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,100\nSo I'll just jump into\nthe network system preference.\n\n528\n00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,540\nNow this is one of those\nsystem preferences where you\n\n529\n00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,270\ncan do certain things as a regular user\nand certain things as an administrator.\n\n530\n00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,880\nThere's actually a lot of access in this\nparticular panel for regular users because\n\n531\n00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,780\nregular users need to be able to\nconnect to different networks.\n\n532\n00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,240\nWhen I come in here I say,\nI have one ethernet connection.\n\n533\n00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,280\nYou may have many more.\n\n534\n00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,170\nLike on my actual laptop I have a good\neight or nine different connections.\n\n535\n00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,790\nBut you'll see your connection and\non the right side you may or\n\n536\n00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,080\nmay not see an IP address.\n\n537\n00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,930\nFor me when I look at my address,\nI can see that I've got this IP\n\n538\n00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:50,000\naddress right here,10.211.55.6, right?\n\n539\n00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,670\nHow did I get the address?\n\n540\n00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,360\nWell, it says right here using DHCP.\n\n541\n00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,150\nThat's Dynamic Host\nConfiguration Protocol.\n\n542\n00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,090\nMost networks support DHCP, and that means\nthat when you plug your computer in,\n\n543\n00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:05,550\nyou don't have to set an IP address,\nyou get one from the network.\n\n544\n00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,761\nYou plug your computer in, and\n\n545\n00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:09,430\nyour computer sends a message out\nn the network called a broadcast.\n\n546\n00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,300\nAnd it sends this broadcast that says,\n\n547\n00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,020\nhey, can somebody out there\nplease give me an IP address?\n\n548\n00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,910\nAnd if you have a DHCP server on your\nnetwork, it will respond back and say,\n\n549\n00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,290\nhere's an address you can use.\n\n550\n00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,100\nGood luck.\n\n551\n00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,040\nAnd we get that address and\nwe're off and ready to go.\n\n552\n00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,150\nThat means your average users doesn't\nhave to worry about the address,\n\n553\n00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,890\nthey get it automatically.\n\n554\n00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,810\nBut if we want to manually assign it,\nwe can drop that box down.\n\n555\n00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,360\nAnd we can tell it manually.\n\n556\n00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,930\nAnd now it's up to us to plug in\nthe information that we want, all right?\n\n557\n00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:45,000\nSo I might give myself\nan address like 10.211.55.100.\n\n558\n00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,663\nAll right, there's my address.\n\n559\n00:31:47,663 --> 00:31:52,079\nWell, after that,\nI can see my subnet mask,\n\n560\n00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,343\n255.255.255.0.\n\n561\n00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:58,723\nThat means if I want to\ntalk to somebody else and\n\n562\n00:31:58,723 --> 00:32:04,628\ntheir IP address starts with 10.211.55,\nwe're on the same network.\n\n563\n00:32:04,628 --> 00:32:08,671\nWe can talk to each other, and\nI don't have to go through a router.\n\n564\n00:32:08,671 --> 00:32:11,008\nI can just reach out and\ntalk to that person.\n\n565\n00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:16,170\nBut, if their address starts with anything\nelse, I'll have to go through a router.\n\n566\n00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,120\nAnd I wanna show you guys that.\n\n567\n00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,410\nI'm gonna delete this router value.\n\n568\n00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,910\nRemember, I said that the router\nvalue is actually optional?\n\n569\n00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:25,660\nSo, I'm gonna leave that off, and just\nput in these two addresses right here,\n\n570\n00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,080\nthe IP address and the subnet mask.\n\n571\n00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,030\nThat's the bare minimum.\n\n572\n00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,820\nThat's what's required.\n\n573\n00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,520\nI'll go ahead and hit Apply and\nthat's gonna take effect.\n\n574\n00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,680\nAnd now I've got this IP address.\n\n575\n00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,843\nI should be able to talk to anybody on\nmy network that has a 10.211.55 address.\n\n576\n00:32:41,843 --> 00:32:44,630\nIf it starts with that I should\nbe able to talk to them.\n\n577\n00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,020\nIf it starts with anything else,\nI shouldn't.\n\n578\n00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,120\nWell let's test that out.\n\n579\n00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,652\nI'll fire up my terminal.\n\n580\n00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:54,910\nAnd I'm just gonna use\na simple ping command here.\n\n581\n00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,140\nAnd we'll try and communicate with\nsome people that are out there.\n\n582\n00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,735\nAnd that was what?\n\n583\n00:32:59,735 --> 00:33:06,555\n10.2.11.55 All right, so I'm going to\ntry and ping 10.211.55.1, all right.\n\n584\n00:33:06,555 --> 00:33:07,960\nThat was my router.\n\n585\n00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,180\nIt's on the same network as me.\n\n586\n00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,778\nIt starts with 10.211.55 I\nshould be able to ping it.\n\n587\n00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:14,460\nAnd there I I can see the ping.\n\n588\n00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,670\nNow, if you've never used ping before,\nit's a very old command.\n\n589\n00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,830\nIt's been around for a long time.\n\n590\n00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,890\nIt was part of the original\nUnix operating system.\n\n591\n00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,000\nIt works on a little echo system.\n\n592\n00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,980\nWe send a message out called\nan echo request saying.\n\n593\n00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,190\nCould you please echo this back to me?\n\n594\n00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,220\nAnd the system that receives it\nsends us an echo reply that says,\n\n595\n00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,260\nyeah, I got your message, here it is.\n\n596\n00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,510\nIt's just a quick way to test out and\n\n597\n00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,800\nverify that we're able to\ncommunicate with that host.\n\n598\n00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,130\nSo, I just did that,\n\n599\n00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:47,040\nI typed ping, followed by the IP address\nI was trying to communicate with.\n\n600\n00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,500\nNow, that ping will\ncontinue running forever.\n\n601\n00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,050\nI hit Ctrl+C to stop it,\nCtrl+C on the keyboard,\n\n602\n00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,550\nyou can see where I hit it, right there.\n\n603\n00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,970\nThat's where I stopped it, and now it's\ndumped me out to the command prompt.\n\n604\n00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,560\nI can communicate on my own network.\n\n605\n00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,740\nIf there's other Macs on my network,\nI can start to browse and find them, or\n\n606\n00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,450\nWindows machines and other stuff.\n\n607\n00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,950\nWe can reach out and\ncommunicate with those guys now.\n\n608\n00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,450\nWe have that connectivity.\n\n609\n00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:13,238\nBut if I try and talk to somebody on\na different network, like if I try and\n\n610\n00:34:13,238 --> 00:34:18,180\nget out to the internet, this is one\nof Google's DNS servers, all right.\n\n611\n00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,850\nIf I try and get out to Google,\nI get request timed out.\n\n612\n00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,436\nOr if I try and get out to Apple for\nthat matter, right.\n\n613\n00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:25,433\nWhat was their IP?\n\n614\n00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:26,234\nI had that written down.\n\n615\n00:34:26,234 --> 00:34:30,565\n23.78.138.214.\n\n616\n00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:31,349\nRight, that's Apple.\n\n617\n00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:32,742\nI can't get to them.\n\n618\n00:34:32,742 --> 00:34:39,960\nAnd the reason is I'm looking at that\naddress and I'm comparing it to my subnet.\n\n619\n00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,340\nSo this one starts with 23.78.138.\n\n620\n00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:47,669\nMy computer looks at the subnet mass and\nit says that my network is 10.211.55,\n\n621\n00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:50,558\nthose don't match I've got to go for\na router.\n\n622\n00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:56,190\nBut I don't have a router, and since\nI don't have a route I can't get out.\n\n623\n00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:01,562\nIf I go back to my network settings and\nI put that router in 10.211.55.1.\n\n624\n00:35:01,562 --> 00:35:06,242\nNow my system knows if I need to get\nto a computer on a different network,\n\n625\n00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:08,620\nI can by going though this router.\n\n626\n00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,274\nAnd that router will help me find my way.\n\n627\n00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:14,134\nAll right.\nAnd so if I go back and\n\n628\n00:35:14,134 --> 00:35:20,190\nrepeat this little process, if I try and\nping to 8.8.8.8, Now I can.\n\n629\n00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,520\nNow I'm getting out there.\n\n630\n00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,480\nI see that it's not on\nthe same network as me,\n\n631\n00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,450\nuntil I go to my trusty\nneighborhood router.\n\n632\n00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,550\nAnd the router takes me along, and\ngets me out the way, all right.\n\n633\n00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,650\nJames posted something interesting\nin the chatroom there.\n\n634\n00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,970\nI actually didn't know that.\n\n635\n00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,770\nPing is an acronym and it stands for\nPacket Internet Groper.\n\n636\n00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,932\nSo kind of a creepy name for it I guess.\n\n637\n00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:43,905\nBut [LAUGH] Inappropriate\nprotocol of the day.\n\n638\n00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:48,720\nBut ping, it's been around a long time,\nvery useful for testing like this.\n\n639\n00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,200\nAnd I did it through the terminal and\nthat's because I have a Unix background,\n\n640\n00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,870\nthat's kinda where I cut my teeth\nwhen I got started in networking.\n\n641\n00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,040\nBut, we actually have a tool, I was gonna\ntalk about it later in the episode but\n\n642\n00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,350\nlet's talk about it now.\n\n643\n00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:03,490\nWe have a cool utility that's built into\nMac OS called the network utility, and\n\n644\n00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,580\nit's got ping and\n\n645\n00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,820\na number of other utilities that are built\ninto it that are really awesome.\n\n646\n00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,214\nLet me show you that utility.\n\n647\n00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:14,520\nYou can launch it via Spotlight or you\ncan browse to your applications folder.\n\n648\n00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,410\nIf I go into my applications folder\nit's actually going to be in\n\n649\n00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,080\nthe utilities folder inside of there.\n\n650\n00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,390\nIf it ever comes up, there we go!\n\n651\n00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,000\nAnd so I can just kind of browse down and\n\n652\n00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,440\nfind utilities and\nI can look in here for network utility.\n\n653\n00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,434\nIt'll be buried in here somewhere and,\nwhere is it?\n\n654\n00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:38,770\nIt may not actually be in utilities\nfolder, It's just under our regular one.\n\n655\n00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,300\nI'm not seeing it.\n\n656\n00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,450\nLet me fire up the old [LAUGH] I'll\njust launch it through Spotlight.\n\n657\n00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,480\nI am kind of curious where\nthat one actually resides.\n\n658\n00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,590\nI could have swore it was\nin the utilities folder,\n\n659\n00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,840\nbut either way you can\nlaunch it with Spotlight.\n\n660\n00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,990\nIt's called the network utility and\nit's got a bunch of stuff built into it.\n\n661\n00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,340\nRight here on the Info tab,\n\n662\n00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,270\nthe first tab we get to, we can see\nthings like what our IP address is.\n\n663\n00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,950\nIt's right there.\n\n664\n00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,350\nThere's my IP address.\n\n665\n00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:05,340\nI can see other information about my\nconnection, is it gigabit and so on.\n\n666\n00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,910\nBut if you look across the top,\nyou'll see various utilities.\n\n667\n00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,810\nOne of them is ping.\n\n668\n00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,040\nAnd you could choose ping, and\n\n669\n00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,020\nthis would be just like what\nI was doing in the terminal.\n\n670\n00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,620\nWe could type that in, and\nwe could tell it to send.\n\n671\n00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,910\nAnd instead of going unlimited,\nsee how this one defaults to ten pings.\n\n672\n00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,290\nSo we don't have to worry about\ncanceling this one, we can let it run,\n\n673\n00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,340\nand it would give us the information, so.\n\n674\n00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:28,050\nIt's a good utility,\nit's definitely one to make use of.\n\n675\n00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:31,670\nIt's got a lot of other neat\nstuff that's in it, right.\n\n676\n00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,520\nSome of the things that are in there\nare like NetStat that will show\n\n677\n00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,950\nall the sessions that my computer\nis currently holding open.\n\n678\n00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,170\nSo your computer is reaching out and\ntalking to other computers and\n\n679\n00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,660\nother people might be talking to you, it\nmight even be happening in the background.\n\n680\n00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,780\nHow do you know it's happening?\n\n681\n00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,360\nWell, Netstat will show that.\n\n682\n00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,870\nAll right?\n\n683\n00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,740\nIt will show us.\n\n684\n00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:53,540\nBut it also shows us our routing table and\nthe routing table is important.\n\n685\n00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,230\nWhen we put in that router, when we said\nhere's the guy we can go to if we need to\n\n686\n00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,650\nget to another network\nthat's not our network.\n\n687\n00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,370\nThat's called a route.\n\n688\n00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,880\nAnd if you click on NetStat, you can\ntell it to display the routing table and\n\n689\n00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,710\nwhen we hit that button, it's gonna\nshow us what our routing table is.\n\n690\n00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,510\nAnd so notice I've got this\ndefault route right here.\n\n691\n00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:17,660\nThe default route is pointing to\n10.211.55.1, that's my router.\n\n692\n00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,120\nThe default route says, if I don't have\na direct way to connect to that network.\n\n693\n00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,480\nGo through the router, use this guy.\n\n694\n00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,630\nReach right out there and\nthat's how we can get there.\n\n695\n00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,050\nOtherwise, look at my interfaces.\n\n696\n00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:34,000\nI've got the 10.2.11.55 network connected\nright here on interface EN0, right.\n\n697\n00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,850\nMy Ethernet network interface zero.\n\n698\n00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,070\nI can connect out and get right to\nthe network, I don't need a router.\n\n699\n00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,870\nBut if I need a router,\nthis is the guy I can use.\n\n700\n00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,990\nSo nets that, shows that,\nit can show a lot of other stuff too.\n\n701\n00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,010\nYou'll see network statistics,\nmultitask information,\n\n702\n00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,470\na bunch of crazy things in there.\n\n703\n00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,605\nBut, at a minimum,\nthe routing table's pretty useful to see.\n\n704\n00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:57,000\nIPv6 is not much different.\n\n705\n00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,050\nWith IPv6, we assign an address, right.\n\n706\n00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:02,280\nIf I go back into my system preferences\nand I go back into Network, and\n\n707\n00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,580\nI go back to my network adapter,\n\n708\n00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,780\nhere's my network adapter, and notice IPv6\nis right here, here's my IPv6 address.\n\n709\n00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,030\nIt's not a very easy address to remember,\nis it?\n\n710\n00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,530\nThere's my IPv6 address, and\nnotice how it won't let me type it in.\n\n711\n00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:22,000\nWell, that's because most people\naren't using IPv6 yet, and\n\n712\n00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,900\nso Apple is managing that for me.\n\n713\n00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,970\nIt's going ahead and assigning that for\nme so that I don't have to, right.\n\n714\n00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:30,320\nIt's already setting it and\nmost people won't have to mess with it.\n\n715\n00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,850\nBut if you want to set\na static IPv6 address you can,\n\n716\n00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,240\nyou just need to hit the advanced button.\n\n717\n00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,980\nAnd if we go under advanced.\n\n718\n00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,480\nYou'll see your TCP/IP connection and\nright down here,\n\n719\n00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,770\nI can see things like my routers and\nother information.\n\n720\n00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,410\nAnd so, we can go in and\nwe can customize those as needed.\n\n721\n00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:53,130\nRight now, configure IPv6 is set to\nautomatic, I can change that to manually\n\n722\n00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:57,710\nand now I can put in the router,\nmy address and the prefix link.\n\n723\n00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,012\nThen the prefix link,\nthat's the subnet mask.\n\n724\n00:40:00,012 --> 00:40:02,990\nIn IPv6, instead of writing it this way,\n\n725\n00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:07,560\nas 255.255.255.0 They write\nit as a binary value.\n\n726\n00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,470\nA certain number of ones, and\na certain number of zeros.\n\n727\n00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:14,910\nThis is telling me that there will be 64\nones, and the remainder will be zeros.\n\n728\n00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,570\nWell it's 128 bits, so\n64 ones and 64 zeros.\n\n729\n00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:21,810\nThat's almost always the prefix\nlength that's used with IPv6,\n\n730\n00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,900\nbut you can use other ones too.\n\n731\n00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,830\nIt's just representing\nthat information there,\n\n732\n00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:30,070\nI can manually change my address here\nto whatever address I need, right?\n\n733\n00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,610\nI can customize that for my own network.\n\n734\n00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:36,906\nI can also specify a router, but\nin IPv6 we don't normally have to.\n\n735\n00:40:36,906 --> 00:40:39,519\nIPv6 is an amazingly smart protocol,\n\n736\n00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:44,680\nit will usually automatically find\nthe router that's on the network.\n\n737\n00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,700\nWhen it comes up,\n\n738\n00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,340\njust like DHCP we talked about\nearlier IPv6 does neighbor discovery.\n\n739\n00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,820\nIt'll discover the other hosts on\nthe network including routers, and so\n\n740\n00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,980\nit'll know hey I can get out to\nthe Internet via this router or\n\n741\n00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,300\nthat router it'll find them on it's own.\n\n742\n00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,390\nI don't have a router specified here, but\n\n743\n00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,500\nI'll likely be able to get\nout to the Internet well\n\n744\n00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,450\nI'll be able to get out to the Internet\nas far as my computer is concerned.\n\n745\n00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,923\nUnfortunately at IT pro TV our\nInternet service provider,\n\n746\n00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:11,090\nwhich is a great company, our ISP.\n\n747\n00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:11,830\nThey don't support IPv6.\n\n748\n00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,820\nAnd you'll find that yours\nlikely doesn't also.\n\n749\n00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,457\nMost ISPs haven't adopted IPv6 yet.\n\n750\n00:41:18,457 --> 00:41:20,403\nYou can use IPv6 internally, but\n\n751\n00:41:20,403 --> 00:41:23,810\nyou won't be able to get out\nto the Internet using it.\n\n752\n00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,010\nThat's how most people are.\n\n753\n00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,900\nIf you're in Europe you're probably lucky\nand you probably do have access to IPv6,\n\n754\n00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,740\nand you can get out to the Internet,\nbut here in the United States,\n\n755\n00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,350\nwe're kind of behind, and\nso we don't have that yet.\n\n756\n00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:38,065\nBut we can specify that information\nhere and get out just like IPv4, right?\n\n757\n00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:41,480\nWe just have to go to\nthe advanced screen to do it.\n\n758\n00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,980\nBut even left to automatic,\nit was working, right, it was working and\n\n759\n00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,650\nit was communicating, now,\nwhen we talk about IPv6 addresses,\n\n760\n00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,570\nthere's actually two different types\nof addresses we need to worry about.\n\n761\n00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:57,420\nThere's our link local addresses,\nand our global addresses.\n\n762\n00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,840\nLink local addresses, those are addresses\nthat are valid just on your network.\n\n763\n00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,440\nJust on your network right\nhere in between machines\n\n764\n00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,400\nright here in the building with you and\nthat's it.\n\n765\n00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,630\nAnd then there's global addresses.\n\n766\n00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:13,820\nThose are unique across the entire world.\n\n767\n00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,290\nAll right you'll see\nthose all over the place.\n\n768\n00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,010\nTo locate these addresses\nthey kinda look the same.\n\n769\n00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:24,970\nThe way you tell the difference with\na link local address it will normal start\n\n770\n00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:28,560\nwith fc through fe.\n\n771\n00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,900\nThat's usually the range that you'll see.\n\n772\n00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,020\nMy address is here.\n\n773\n00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,460\nSee how they start with fd?\n\n774\n00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,240\nThat fd is my indicator so I know\nthat this is a linked local address.\n\n775\n00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,160\nIf it starts with ff, that's called\na multicast address and that's used for\n\n776\n00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,440\nsome other services that\nwe'll talk about later.\n\n777\n00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,700\nIf it starts with a two, well,\nif it starts with a two,\n\n778\n00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,790\nit's normally going to be a global\naddress, unique across the Internet.\n\n779\n00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,910\nYou don't have to memorize these for\nthe exam, I'm just saying it's so\n\n780\n00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,800\nthat you guys know, and\nyou can recognize those.\n\n781\n00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,800\nRemember when I brought up\nApple's IP address earlier?\n\n782\n00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,460\nWhere did I do that?\n\n783\n00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,690\nIt was in some screen.\n\n784\n00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,720\nOh, I've got it right here I think.\n\n785\n00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,520\nHere.\nThis is Apple's IPv6 address.\n\n786\n00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,780\nAnd see how it starts with 2600,\nit starts with a two.\n\n787\n00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,500\nAnd that two is an indicator\nthat's a globally unique address.\n\n788\n00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,600\nNobody in the entire planet,\nhas that same address.\n\n789\n00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:18,690\nIt is just Apple's, they have it versus\nthese link local addresses where there\n\n790\n00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,020\nmight be, other people out there\nthat have that same address.\n\n791\n00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,970\nIt could be, and\n\n792\n00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:25,440\nit wouldn't be a problem because it's\nonly valid on your local network.\n\n793\n00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,900\nWell, those are automatically defined.\n\n794\n00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,310\nI didn't have to define those.\n\n795\n00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:32,140\nYour computer set those, and so if you\nhave more than one Mac on your network and\n\n796\n00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:36,400\nthey're talking to each other, the odds\nare they're using IPv6 to do it, right?\n\n797\n00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,800\nBonjour and a few of the other protocols,\nthey all prefer IPv6 over IPv4\n\n798\n00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,570\nif they can, we go out to the Internet\nwe're pretty much stuck using IPv4 for\n\n799\n00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:50,040\nnow until we'll see that\nroute begin to clear.\n\n800\n00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,690\nAll right.\nAs far as assigning IP addresses like\n\n801\n00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:53,550\nthis, that's basically it.\n\n802\n00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,550\nIt's not a hard process\nto assign those IP's.\n\n803\n00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:00,840\nThere is normally one other thing\nthat we set and that's a DNS server.\n\n804\n00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,740\nAll right.\n\n805\n00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,720\nDNS is the domain name system,\nor Domain Naming System.\n\n806\n00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:11,240\nAnd what it does, is allows us to tie\nnames to an IP address, all right?\n\n807\n00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,460\nAll of you watching the show have\nprobably been to Apple's website before.\n\n808\n00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,302\nAnd you probably went there\nby typing www.apple.com.\n\n809\n00:44:17,302 --> 00:44:19,609\nBut do you know what their IP address is?\n\n810\n00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:21,390\nI had to look it up.\n\n811\n00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,820\nI wrote it down before the show, right?\n\n812\n00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,900\nIT Pro TV, I work for IT Pro TV.\n\n813\n00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,930\nI go to that website every single day.\n\n814\n00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:28,995\nI go to IT PRO.TV.\n\n815\n00:44:28,995 --> 00:44:32,220\nI don't know the IP address of IT Pro TV,\nright?\n\n816\n00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,990\nThat IP address is masked.\n\n817\n00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,390\nIt's hidden behind a name.\n\n818\n00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:39,610\nI type a name that's easy to remember.\n\n819\n00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:44,070\nAnd for most end users, that's what\nthey want, well, DNS provides that.\n\n820\n00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,940\nTypically we don't just set an IP address,\nwe typically jump over to DNS,\n\n821\n00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,240\nand assign some DNS servers also.\n\n822\n00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,660\nNotice how I don't have\nany DNS servers right now.\n\n823\n00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:57,270\nIf I were to open up a terminal or\n\n824\n00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,290\nactually I can just go back\nhere to network utility.\n\n825\n00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:02,090\nIn network utility you\ngot the look up tab.\n\n826\n00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:06,350\nAnd here we can try and look something up\nlike I can try and look up, www.apple.com.\n\n827\n00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:10,060\nWhen I go to look it up I\ndon't get anything back.\n\n828\n00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,440\nI get operation couldn't be completed.\n\n829\n00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,720\nI don't have a DNS server.\n\n830\n00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,410\nI don't have somebody helping\nme turn that name to an IP.\n\n831\n00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,280\nBut if I go back to my\nnetwork preferences.\n\n832\n00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:25,920\nAnd to that DNS tab,\nI can add in IP systems right here and\n\n833\n00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,350\nso I can punch in a DNS server\nthat's out there to use.\n\n834\n00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:34,810\nI'll use Google's,\nokay Google has 8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.\n\n835\n00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:38,040\nYour Internet service provider\nprobably has DNS servers for\n\n836\n00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,835\nyou to use, or your company might have\nDNS servers for you to use too, so\n\n837\n00:45:41,835 --> 00:45:44,540\nit's kinda up to you how\nyou wanna go about that.\n\n838\n00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,670\nFor example, we've got one here in\nIT Pro TV that is 10.1.230.1, so\n\n839\n00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:55,030\nI might specify that, but you put in\nwhatever DNS servers, you need, all right,\n\n840\n00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:58,530\nnow when I go back and I do that search,\nwell actually, I think I need to hit okay.\n\n841\n00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,690\nI don't think it applies\nautomatically if I remember right.\n\n842\n00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:02,830\nI'm just gonna go back here and hit Apply.\n\n843\n00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:05,960\nBe careful with that some of the network\nsettings take effect right away,\n\n844\n00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,490\nsome do require you to come out and\nhit Apply first, so\n\n845\n00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:11,430\nI'm just making sure that I hit Apply so\nthat I know it takes effect.\n\n846\n00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:18,550\nAnd now if I go and do that lookup, there\nit goes and I get the IPv4 address as\n\n847\n00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:22,770\nwell as the IPv6 address right I see those\naddresses right there, and I'm good to go.\n\n848\n00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:26,220\nAll right, so\nthere's the addresses that came backward.\n\n849\n00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,360\nHey, we can answer our question.\n\n850\n00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,980\nWhat exactly is the IP\naddress of itpro.tv?\n\n851\n00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,024\nAnd there it is, 72.10.35.44.\n\n852\n00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:34,644\nThat's the address, right?\n\n853\n00:46:34,644 --> 00:46:35,900\nEasy enough to spot.\n\n854\n00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,230\nAll right, so those are name look ups,\nand they're pretty important, right?\n\n855\n00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:46,050\nBecause we don't wanna have to remember\nIP addresses and other information.\n\n856\n00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,290\nThere is some neat stuff in here,\ntoo, though.\n\n857\n00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:52,380\nLike if you've got local hosts, people\nthat are right here on your own network,\n\n858\n00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,270\nwhen you do a name look up you might\nnot want to type in the whole name,\n\n859\n00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:59,150\nyou might wanna just type\nin just part of a name.\n\n860\n00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:04,770\nFor example, if I knew I was gonna\nbe doing lookups for, I don't know.\n\n861\n00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,520\nI don't really have a DNS\nserver set up for this.\n\n862\n00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,064\nIf I was gonna do a lookup for lab.itpro.\n\n863\n00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:14,230\nLet's see if this is defined.\n\n864\n00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:16,240\nI don't know if we actually\nhave an IP tied to this one.\n\n865\n00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,410\nLet me see what I get.\n\n866\n00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:18,890\nI do a search for lab dot IT Pro TV.\n\n867\n00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:21,250\nOh yeah, we don't have that one to find.\n\n868\n00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,245\nWhat is something that I could use?\n\n869\n00:47:23,245 --> 00:47:26,890\n[LAUGH] Trying to think of\na server that I could use.\n\n870\n00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:31,030\nWell, I guess we could kind of cheat\na little bit here and say www.google.com.\n\n871\n00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:31,690\nAll right.\n\n872\n00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:36,040\nWhen I do a look-up for that, that name\nis actually made up of several pieces.\n\n873\n00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,640\nThere's the host.\n\n874\n00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,983\nThe host is actually called www.\n\n875\n00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:41,150\nAnd then there's the domain.\n\n876\n00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,680\nIn this case, the domain is google.com.\n\n877\n00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,370\nRight?\n\n878\n00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,490\nThose are the two pieces of that name.\n\n879\n00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,620\nI did a look-up and\nit returned the addresses for that.\n\n880\n00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:49,290\nRight.\n\n881\n00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:53,370\nWell, if I know that I'm gonna be\nworking with Google servers a lot, and\n\n882\n00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,200\nI don't want to type the whole\nname I just want to type the host.\n\n883\n00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,320\nI just want to type www.\n\n884\n00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,008\nAnd that's it, right, a single name.\n\n885\n00:48:00,008 --> 00:48:03,399\nWell, what you can do is back\nin your network settings,\n\n886\n00:48:03,399 --> 00:48:05,138\nyou can set search domains.\n\n887\n00:48:05,138 --> 00:48:08,918\nAnd we'll search domains, what you're\ndoing is adding in a maze that will be\n\n888\n00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:10,965\nused in the event you don't provide one.\n\n889\n00:48:10,965 --> 00:48:15,513\nSo if I come in here and I say,\ngoogle.com, if I do a search for\n\n890\n00:48:15,513 --> 00:48:20,322\na single name, if I search for\nserver one, or if I search for www,\n\n891\n00:48:20,322 --> 00:48:25,715\nit will add on google.com to the end\nof it and try and resolve it, right.\n\n892\n00:48:25,715 --> 00:48:27,875\nSo, you might have local domains for\nyour network,\n\n893\n00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:29,265\nand you can punch each of those in there.\n\n894\n00:48:29,265 --> 00:48:30,045\nYou can have more than one.\n\n895\n00:48:30,045 --> 00:48:31,985\nAnd, it'll just go through them in order,\n\n896\n00:48:31,985 --> 00:48:35,145\ntrying each one until it finds\none that gets a hit, all right.\n\n897\n00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:42,300\nAnd, if I Apply that, and go back here and\ndo a DNS lookup just for www,\n\n898\n00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:47,660\nwell it's going to append google.com\nto it and I get an answer, right.\n\n899\n00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,330\nSo that's a search domain.\n\n900\n00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:55,910\nThose are optional, not really needed,\nbut we can punch those in if we need to.\n\n901\n00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,426\nThank you.\nCarlton, actually.\n\n902\n00:48:57,426 --> 00:49:01,325\n[LAUGH] Earlier, I couldn't' find where\nthe network utilities was cuz it used to\n\n903\n00:49:01,325 --> 00:49:03,110\nbe in that utilities folder.\n\n904\n00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:07,670\nAnd Carlton said that it's now hidden\nunder the system core services folder.\n\n905\n00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:10,790\nSo, it's actually buried\ninside of the system folder.\n\n906\n00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,090\nJust use spotlight to get to it.\n\n907\n00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:12,990\nThat'll be the easiest way.\n\n908\n00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:16,480\nIf you fire up spotlight,\nI do command-space all the time.\n\n909\n00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,910\nAnd type in network utility.\n\n910\n00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,410\nYou'll find it real quick, and\nyou will be able to launch that.\n\n911\n00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:21,760\nThat's a little bit easier.\n\n912\n00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,000\nA little less painful than trying\nto browse into the system folder.\n\n913\n00:49:26,492 --> 00:49:28,180\nAll right, so IP addresses,\n\n914\n00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,950\nI think we have seen how the IP addresses\nwork, how the subnet mass work, and\n\n915\n00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:35,670\nhow DNS servers work which is pretty\nimportant to mask all of that.\n\n916\n00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,060\nThese are key things that\nwe wanna setup on a system.\n\n917\n00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,430\nIf you've got DHCP,\nit all gets done for you, right.\n\n918\n00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:45,480\nIf I take this system and I go back\nunder its network adaptor in my system\n\n919\n00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:51,960\npreferences, and I change Configure IPv4\nto use DHCP, and I hit Apply.\n\n920\n00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,018\nRight now, it's asking the network,\nsaying, hey,\n\n921\n00:49:54,018 --> 00:49:55,284\ncan somebody give me an address?\n\n922\n00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,898\nAnd it just got it back.\n\n923\n00:49:56,898 --> 00:49:59,417\nIt got 10.211.55.6.\n\n924\n00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:03,950\nIt got this subnet mask,\nit got this router, all right.\n\n925\n00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:08,450\nNow, my DNS server and my search domains,\nI've overridden those.\n\n926\n00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:10,920\nIf I go back into my advanced screen, and\n\n927\n00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,190\nI remove all the stuff that I put in here,\nright.\n\n928\n00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,950\nSee I put a bunch of things in here.\n\n929\n00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:18,100\nIf I remove all that,\nlet's just get these guys out of here,\n\n930\n00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,030\nwhen those are gone and\nthere's nothing left.\n\n931\n00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:24,430\nIt's not gonna let me\nremove that last one.\n\n932\n00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,490\nThat one's coming from the DACP server.\n\n933\n00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:31,510\nIf I remove all of these,\nlet me actually make sure we can see this.\n\n934\n00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,288\nI'm just gonna go to manually for\nthe IPs again.\n\n935\n00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:37,870\nOkay, it's mad about that IP address.\n\n936\n00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:41,458\nSo let me just put it back to manual for\na second, I'll put a fake address in.\n\n937\n00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:46,280\nJust so I can get in here.\n\n938\n00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,260\nAnd what I wanna do is I wanna remove\nthose DNS servers and get them out.\n\n939\n00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,470\nShoot, I forgot to hit apply.\n\n940\n00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:54,030\nThere's that whole hit apply thing, right?\n\n941\n00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,330\nKind of important.\n\n942\n00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:58,810\nBut if I go in here and\nI remove those DNS servers, there we go.\n\n943\n00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:01,410\nSo how my DNS servers and\nsearch domains are completely empty now?\n\n944\n00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,920\nWhen I go back here and tell it to use\nDHCP, it's gonna reach out to the network\n\n945\n00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,850\nand it's not just gonna get\nan IP address and SubNet mask.\n\n946\n00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:11,100\nIt's gonna get the router.\n\n947\n00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,420\nAs well as DNS information, too.\n\n948\n00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,160\nAnd so see how it got a DNS server right\nthere which is the same as the router.\n\n949\n00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,960\nI am able to get that information\nfrom DHCP and function.\n\n950\n00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,260\nAnd so\nI'll still be able to do name lookups.\n\n951\n00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:27,890\nSo if I search for cnn.com.\n\n952\n00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:30,450\nWe'll look that up, and\nI get my responses, right.\n\n953\n00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:34,570\nAll functioning with no real\nconfiguration by the end user, all right.\n\n954\n00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:38,305\nThat's called zero configuration and\na lot of protocols have that support.\n\n955\n00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:40,665\nZero configuration means the end\nuser doesn't have to worry about it.\n\n956\n00:51:41,925 --> 00:51:45,485\nAll right, well, there's a lot of advanced\nthings that I wanna take a look at, too.\n\n957\n00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:46,845\nBut let's stop here and take a break, and\n\n958\n00:51:46,845 --> 00:51:50,105\nwhen we get back, we'll continue\non with network configurations.\n\n959\n00:51:50,105 --> 00:51:51,095\nSo stay tuned.\n\n960\n00:51:51,095 --> 00:51:54,091\nWe'll be back in a few moments.\n\n961\n00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:58,784\n[SOUND].\n\n962\n00:51:58,784 --> 00:52:00,950\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n963\n00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:04,380\nSo in the last segment we got a chance\nto see what an IP address is.\n\n964\n00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,540\nAnd I did some pings to verify\nsome basic communication.\n\n965\n00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:10,460\nThere's actually a little bit more going\non under the hood that I want you guys\n\n966\n00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,580\nto be aware of.\n\n967\n00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:15,870\nWhen you communicate locally on a network,\nyou use the IP\n\n968\n00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:19,090\naddress to determine if the other\nperson is on the same network as you.\n\n969\n00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:21,980\nBut, when you actually go\nto communicate to them,\n\n970\n00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:25,870\nyou don't use the IP address,\nyou use what's called their mac address.\n\n971\n00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:30,530\nAnd not mac as in macintosh but\nmac as in media access control.\n\n972\n00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,610\nEvery network interface, be it wireless or\n\n973\n00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:37,550\nwired, has a MAC address,\nhas a Media Access Control address.\n\n974\n00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:41,990\nWhen they speak on those networks they're\nusing a protocol called Ethernet.\n\n975\n00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:46,780\nAnd Ethernet uses media control to\ndetermine who's allowed to talk when.\n\n976\n00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:52,130\nAnd every frame, every set of data that\nwe throw on the network has to have\n\n977\n00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:56,370\na Mac address attached to it, a source Mac\naddress, where the data's coming from, and\n\n978\n00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:58,630\na destination Mac address,\nwhere it's going to.\n\n979\n00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:01,270\nNow, that sounds a little redundant,\n\n980\n00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:05,670\nbecause if I'm communicating to\nsomebody out on the internet,\n\n981\n00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:10,500\nI've got a source IP address, mine,\nand a destination IP address, theirs.\n\n982\n00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,480\nIf I've already got a source and a\ndestination address, that's a IP address,\n\n983\n00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,650\nwhy do I need a source and a destination\naddress that's a Mac address also?\n\n984\n00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,530\nWhy have that duplication?\n\n985\n00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:23,640\nWell, the reason is sometimes I\nhave data that's destined for\n\n986\n00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,120\none host, but I need it to go to\na different host instead first.\n\n987\n00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,010\nWhy would I do that?\n\n988\n00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:33,350\nWell, think about when you\ncommunicate out to the internet.\n\n989\n00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:36,430\nWhen I communicate out to the internet, I\nmight be trying to go to Apple's website.\n\n990\n00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:41,110\nAnd Apple's website might be 23 dot\nsomething dot something, right.\n\n991\n00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:43,800\nSo, I'm trying to go out\nto apples website and\n\n992\n00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,520\nI know that IP address,\nthat's the addresses I wanna get to.\n\n993\n00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,360\nBut it's not on the same network as me,\nso I've got to go through a router.\n\n994\n00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,580\nSo, even though my data is destined for\n\n995\n00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:56,030\napple, I need to send it\nto my router instead.\n\n996\n00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:58,000\nAnd then my router will forward it along.\n\n997\n00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,100\nSo the IP address is the start and\nthe finish of your communication, right.\n\n998\n00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,750\nThe beginning and end point, but\n\n999\n00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:09,030\nthere's a lot of stuff that's in-between\nall the routers that you pass through.\n\n1000\n00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:14,140\nAnd the routers will use the MAC\naddress to determine the next hop.\n\n1001\n00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:17,440\nThey call it the next hop,\nthe very next step in your journey.\n\n1002\n00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,547\nWell, when two computers are on the same\nnetwork, they talk right to each other,\n\n1003\n00:54:20,547 --> 00:54:22,753\nthey can use their Mac addresses,\nthat is their next hop,\n\n1004\n00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:24,400\nbut when you communicate on the Internet.\n\n1005\n00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,110\nYou might pass through many routers\non your way to a destination.\n\n1006\n00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:30,180\nLet me show you.\n\n1007\n00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:34,450\nWe've got another utility here inside\nof Network Utility called traceroute.\n\n1008\n00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:40,300\nAnd traceroute will show me all of\nthe stuff in between my computer and\n\n1009\n00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,040\nsomebody that I'm trying to reach out to.\n\n1010\n00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:46,650\nSo when I reach out to Apple,\nI don't have a direct connection to Apple.\n\n1011\n00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,680\nI don't think they would\nappreciate it if I did.\n\n1012\n00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:52,650\nSo, I rely on other routers to\nconnect me to that destination.\n\n1013\n00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:55,180\nAnd if I type in that\ndestination here in traceroute.\n\n1014\n00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,460\nAnd I hit trace.\n\n1015\n00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,530\nIt's gonna show me all the stuff\nthat I have to pass through.\n\n1016\n00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,510\nOkay, now here in network utility.\n\n1017\n00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:05,150\nI don't think it lets me\nbump up my font at all.\n\n1018\n00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:05,650\nDoes it?\nLet's see.\n\n1019\n00:55:08,126 --> 00:55:09,730\nYeah, it doesn't really\nlet me bump up my file.\n\n1020\n00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:10,910\nLet me do this.\n\n1021\n00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:13,500\nI'm gonna drop to\na terminal window instead\n\n1022\n00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,480\nbecause in the terminal I can\nactually zoom this in quite a bit.\n\n1023\n00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,490\nAnd we'll actually be able to\nsee this a little bit better.\n\n1024\n00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,280\nAll right.\nSo I'm just gonna do a trace route and\n\n1025\n00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,750\nI'll trace right out to some other\nsite that's out there, right.\n\n1026\n00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,110\nMaybe itpro.tv, all right.\n\n1027\n00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:35,879\nIf I wanna get to that server, well,\nITProTV is 72.10.35.44, right.\n\n1028\n00:55:35,879 --> 00:55:36,780\nThat's.\n\n1029\n00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,670\nAnother host that's out\nthere on the network.\n\n1030\n00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:41,720\nIt's not on my network, so\nI've gotta got through some routers.\n\n1031\n00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,410\nAnd traceroute is gonna sort that out.\n\n1032\n00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,010\nNow I'm in a virtual machine and\n\n1033\n00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,290\nI forgot to adjust my firewall\nto allow that through.\n\n1034\n00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:48,900\nSo I'm gonna get some stars like this.\n\n1035\n00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,850\nWhen you see stars, that means\nthe host that was that first journey\n\n1036\n00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,960\ndidn't respond and usually once you get\nthat the rest of the chain is that way.\n\n1037\n00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,908\nLet me do this from my actual laptop so\nwe can see the full path.\n\n1038\n00:55:58,908 --> 00:56:03,886\nAll right, so\nhere I am on my actual laptop.\n\n1039\n00:56:03,886 --> 00:56:06,056\nAnd if I do a traceroute out to...\n\n1040\n00:56:06,056 --> 00:56:09,297\nitpro.tv, there we go,\nthat's what I expect to see.\n\n1041\n00:56:09,297 --> 00:56:14,278\nWhat it's showing me, is a list of all\nthe routers I had to go through to\n\n1042\n00:56:14,278 --> 00:56:19,345\nget to the ITProTV website, and\napparently we're blocking something\n\n1043\n00:56:19,345 --> 00:56:24,430\nin the IT productivity website so\nit's not actually getting through.\n\n1044\n00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:28,270\nBut you'll see 10.1.230.1, that's our\nfire wall right here in the building.\n\n1045\n00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:31,240\nI wanted to get to the internet,\nso I went to my firewall.\n\n1046\n00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,950\nAnd from there, it went up to our ISP,\nour internet service provider is GRU.net,\n\n1047\n00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,592\nGainesville Regional Utilities.\n\n1048\n00:56:37,592 --> 00:56:41,100\nSo I go through them, and I'll rattle\naround their servers a little bit before\n\n1049\n00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:45,240\nthey send me, here it's still GRU,\nhere's GRU, I'm rattling around inside of\n\n1050\n00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:49,950\ntheir network before they jump me over\nto another service provider, right?\n\n1051\n00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:53,680\nNTT, that's one of the bigger backbone\nproviders, and I'm in Atlanta,\n\n1052\n00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,780\nthat ATL right there, letting me know\nthat I jumped all the way up to Atlanta.\n\n1053\n00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:02,050\nAnd then we move through their\nservers on the way over to wherever\n\n1054\n00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,200\nITProTV is hosted.\n\n1055\n00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,700\nNow, it's hosted on Media Temple.\n\n1056\n00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,930\nThat's a service provider and so\n\n1057\n00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,570\nit's finding them and\nreaching that destination.\n\n1058\n00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:12,970\nAnd then on our server, we must be\nblocking pings or blocking trace routes,\n\n1059\n00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:14,490\nand so it's not getting through.\n\n1060\n00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:18,390\nIf a pick a site like Apple,\nyou might see the same thing.\n\n1061\n00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:21,850\nThere's a lot of service providers\nthat will block those trace routes.\n\n1062\n00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,160\nOh, well, Apple's not.\n\n1063\n00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,920\nSo I can see, I jumped to GRU.\n\n1064\n00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,450\nGRU sends me along to Atlanta, again.\n\n1065\n00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:31,960\nAnd I hit Akamai, Akamai is\na Content Delivery Network, or a CDN.\n\n1066\n00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,470\nThey have servers all over the world,\nand I can see,\n\n1067\n00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:40,770\nI got a copy of Apples website,\nright from Akamai's servers in Atlanta.\n\n1068\n00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:42,550\nI only had to pass through\nseven routers to get there.\n\n1069\n00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,714\nA very very short distance.\n\n1070\n00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:44,820\nRight.\n\n1071\n00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,610\nOther servers you might have to pass\nthrough 20 routers to get there.\n\n1072\n00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:48,780\nOr if you're in other countries,\n\n1073\n00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:51,310\nyou may have passed through\nway more servers to get there.\n\n1074\n00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:54,240\nWell, your beginning point and\nyour end point for\n\n1075\n00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,770\nyour communication that never changes.\n\n1076\n00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,050\nThe IP information.\n\n1077\n00:57:57,050 --> 00:58:01,280\nIt came from you and\nit's going to Apple's website or wherever.\n\n1078\n00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,760\nBut the MAC addresses,\n\n1079\n00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,310\nthe media access control addresses\nchange With every single hop.\n\n1080\n00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:11,360\nThe destination MAC address was\nthe MAC address for the 10.1.230.1.\n\n1081\n00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:15,150\nThen, it was the MAC address for\nthis guy, 209.251.159.177.\n\n1082\n00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:20,530\nThen it was the MAC address for,\noops, this guy, if I can highlight.\n\n1083\n00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:24,040\nAnd it kept changing all the way\nout as I went across that network,\n\n1084\n00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,880\nchanging each hop along the way.\n\n1085\n00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,880\nNow that happens in the background and\nwe don't normally see it, but\n\n1086\n00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,310\nI do want to show this process to you\nbecause it can turn up on the exam.\n\n1087\n00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:38,240\nIf you want to see your MAC address all\nyou have to do is go into your system\n\n1088\n00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,490\npreferences and go into your network.\n\n1089\n00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,820\nSo here's my network settings.\n\n1090\n00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,230\nAnd if you go into Advanced,\n\n1091\n00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,690\nyou'll be able to find the information\nburied under Hardware.\n\n1092\n00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:55,990\nSo if I look under Hardware,\nright there is my MAC address.\n\n1093\n00:58:55,990 --> 00:59:00,780\nThe MAC address for\nthis adaptor is 00:1C:42:5D:A4:9E.\n\n1094\n00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,900\nRolls right off the tongue.\n\n1095\n00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,690\nIt's a 48 bit hexadecimal number, so\n\n1096\n00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:08,900\nit's kind of like IPv6 addresses\nexcept they're 128 bit, much larger.\n\n1097\n00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,030\nThis is only 48 bit.\n\n1098\n00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:15,130\nBut I can see that Mac address and\nthat identifies my network adaptor.\n\n1099\n00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:19,980\nSo when I talk on a local network, that's\nmy Mac address, my media access control,\n\n1100\n00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,380\nand other computers on\nthe network need to learn that.\n\n1101\n00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:27,710\nAnd that's happening thanks to a protocol\ncalled Address Resolution Protocol,\n\n1102\n00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:28,970\nor ARP.\n\n1103\n00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:33,340\nARP runs in the background and it helps us\nfind the Mac addresses of other systems.\n\n1104\n00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:37,820\nSo, for example, when I fire up\na terminal window, and I ping my router.\n\n1105\n00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,328\nSo I'm pinging my router 10.211.55.1.\n\n1106\n00:59:43,328 --> 00:59:45,900\nI'm pinging it and there it is.\n\n1107\n00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,370\nWell I pinged it via and IPV4 address.\n\n1108\n00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,300\nBut it actually used the Mac address for\nthe communication.\n\n1109\n00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:57,270\nIn the background,\nit sent out a broadcast on the network and\n\n1110\n00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:02,300\nit said hey I'm trying to get to\n10.211.55.1 what's your MAC address.\n\n1111\n01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:08,190\nAnd 10.211.55.1 heard that broadcast and\nresponded back and said, hey this is my\n\n1112\n01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:12,670\nMAC address and so we learned it and then\nthat's how we built our data to go to it.\n\n1113\n01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,840\nAnd you can see that if you want there's\nnot a lot of reason to see it but\n\n1114\n01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:21,470\nif you want to in your\nterminal you can run arp-a\n\n1115\n01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:26,500\nARP is the Address Resolution Protocol,\n-a means show me all of the cache.\n\n1116\n01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,890\nWe cache, we save these values so\nthat we can use them again.\n\n1117\n01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:31,510\nThe next time I need to\ncommunicate with that IP,\n\n1118\n01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:33,250\nI don't want to have to\ndo the lookup again.\n\n1119\n01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:36,480\nSo this will just display it and\nI can see who I've learned.\n\n1120\n01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,340\nAnd see how I've got 10.211.55.1,\nthat's the router.\n\n1121\n01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,442\nAnd here's its MAC address, right?\n\n1122\n01:00:42,442 --> 01:00:44,450\n0:1c:42:0:0:18.\n\n1123\n01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:51,670\nI'm on a virtual machine here, so\nthe MAC addresses are a little bit weird.\n\n1124\n01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:54,840\nLet me do it on a actual machine,\nlike here on my laptop.\n\n1125\n01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:59,458\nIf I do an arp -a, I've talked to all\nsorts of computers on my network, right?\n\n1126\n01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:02,360\n10.1.230, that's our studio network here.\n\n1127\n01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:06,220\nAnd you'll see where I've talked to our\nlittle encoding machine, our tricaster,\n\n1128\n01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,060\nsome other computers on the network.\n\n1129\n01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,530\nAnd I'm learning each of them.\n\n1130\n01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:14,560\nHere's their IP address and\nhere's their MAC address on my network.\n\n1131\n01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,510\nAnd it's tied to one adapter or another.\n\n1132\n01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:19,210\nNow I've got two network\nadapters in my system.\n\n1133\n01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:25,745\nEN0, that is a physical Thunderbolt\nnetwork adapter on the side of my laptop.\n\n1134\n01:01:25,745 --> 01:01:28,870\nEN7, that's my wireless network adapter.\n\n1135\n01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:32,900\nSo I'm seeing a lot of these\npeople on two different adapters.\n\n1136\n01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:37,270\nSee how I've got 10.1.230.1, our firewall?\n\n1137\n01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:40,470\nThe Mac address is the same but\nI can see it via both adapters,\n\n1138\n01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:44,140\nvia my physical copper adapter and\nvia my wireless adapter.\n\n1139\n01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,330\nAnd so it gets two entries\nthere in the arc table.\n\n1140\n01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:47,010\nI'd get to it either way.\n\n1141\n01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,550\nNow, that's an important\nthing to remember.\n\n1142\n01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:53,960\nInside of Mac OS, you may have\nmore than one network adapter.\n\n1143\n01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,440\nI know in my virtual machine back here,\nif I go into System Preferences and\n\n1144\n01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:02,180\nNetwork, I only have one adapter, right?\n\n1145\n01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,210\nI just have this ethernet adapter.\n\n1146\n01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:05,480\nBut that's pretty rare.\n\n1147\n01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,160\nYou're normally going to have more.\n\n1148\n01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:09,570\nI'm kind of a network guy, so\n\n1149\n01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:12,080\nI actually have more than most\npeople I think will normally have.\n\n1150\n01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,400\nIf I go into my system preference,\n\n1151\n01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:17,780\nyou'll see that I've got a bunch\nof network adapters, right?\n\n1152\n01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:18,750\n[LAUGH] More than what fits on the screen.\n\n1153\n01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:21,220\nIt's gotta create a little scroll bar for\nme, right?\n\n1154\n01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:22,570\nI've got two that are green.\n\n1155\n01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:24,170\nThat means they're working right now.\n\n1156\n01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:25,660\nSo two that are working right now.\n\n1157\n01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,060\nAnd then all these red ones that\nare sitting there doing nothing.\n\n1158\n01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:32,090\nLet's walk through these and\nsee what they are.\n\n1159\n01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:35,810\nThe first one I've got is\na Thunderbolt ethernet adapter.\n\n1160\n01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:37,750\nWell, I've got a Macbook Pro and\n\n1161\n01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:40,980\nwith the newer Macbook Pro's they don't\nhave a network jack on them anymore.\n\n1162\n01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:43,190\nSo if you want to plug\ninto a physical network,\n\n1163\n01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:45,030\nyou've got to use one of\nthese little adapters.\n\n1164\n01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,930\nI've got a Thunderbolt adapter\nthat turns into a RJ-45 jack,\n\n1165\n01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,330\nthat you can plug a network cable into.\n\n1166\n01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:52,090\nRight?\nAnd that's what I used here on the show.\n\n1167\n01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:56,840\nI always want a reliable connection\non the show, and so I use that.\n\n1168\n01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,580\nI also have my wireless adapter,\nand that's next.\n\n1169\n01:02:58,580 --> 01:02:59,720\nI see Wi-Fi.\n\n1170\n01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,720\nRight?\nWi-Fi, it's connected.\n\n1171\n01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,750\nI've got a wireless connector, and\n\n1172\n01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:06,770\nthat works great normally, but\nWi-Fi can be a little flakey sometimes.\n\n1173\n01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:09,640\nThe further away you get from\nthe access point the less reliable that\n\n1174\n01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,700\nconnection gets.\n\n1175\n01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:14,420\nBut I see that I've got\na Wi-Fi adapter also, right.\n\n1176\n01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,770\nThen I've got a USB controller.\n\n1177\n01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:20,190\nSo there's this USB serial controller,\nthat's for a little serial port I use for\n\n1178\n01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:21,540\nmanaging some devices.\n\n1179\n01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,920\nIt's not truly a network connection.\n\n1180\n01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,910\nThen I've got USB ethernet.\n\n1181\n01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:27,450\nThat's a generic adapter, it's actually.\n\n1182\n01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,080\nThis guy right here.\n\n1183\n01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:36,510\nThis little connector that I can plug into\na USB port and get an RJ45 jack that way.\n\n1184\n01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:38,060\nRight?\nWhen I come up here to the podium,\n\n1185\n01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,700\nsometimes I forget my Thunderbolt adapter,\nand so I just use this one.\n\n1186\n01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:45,750\nI stick it on there and I get a USB\n32 gigabit ethernet connection.\n\n1187\n01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:49,330\nSo, different types of\nconnections are available there.\n\n1188\n01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:51,000\nWhat else do I have on the list?\n\n1189\n01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,750\nThis AX88.\n\n1190\n01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,480\nThat's actually my docking station.\n\n1191\n01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,410\nWhen I go back to my desk, I take my\nlaptop and I stick it in a docking\n\n1192\n01:03:57,410 --> 01:04:00,600\nstation, and it's got a network\nadaptor built into it and that's it.\n\n1193\n01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,851\nSo it shows as red right now,\nnot connected.\n\n1194\n01:04:02,851 --> 01:04:06,585\nBut if I go sit back at my desk and\nplug in, that's gonna light up and\n\n1195\n01:04:06,585 --> 01:04:08,540\nthat will be my connection there.\n\n1196\n01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:11,090\nI've got a, let's see, what is this?\n\n1197\n01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:15,310\nA Broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Ethernet\ncontroller.\n\n1198\n01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,090\nThat's a nice long one.\n\n1199\n01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:18,010\nThat's actually my old docking station.\n\n1200\n01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:19,480\nI don't have that one anymore.\n\n1201\n01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,030\nSo, since I don't have that\nanymore I could remove it.\n\n1202\n01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:24,560\nNotice down here I've got pluses and\nminuses.\n\n1203\n01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,640\nYou can remove these connections\nif you don't have them anymore.\n\n1204\n01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,040\nSo I don't have the Broadcom anymore.\n\n1205\n01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:32,650\nI'll just hit the minus, and\nnow it goes away and I can hit Apply.\n\n1206\n01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:34,360\nAnd now that adapter is gone.\n\n1207\n01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:38,660\nIf I ever plug it in again the adapter\nwill show back up I will get it again but\n\n1208\n01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:40,650\nright now I don't have it in my list.\n\n1209\n01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:46,450\nI've got thunderbolt fire wire, I don't\nhave any fire wire jacks on my laptop but\n\n1210\n01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:49,120\nApple has a thunderbolt\nto fire wire adapter and\n\n1211\n01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,040\nif I plug that in Firewire\nactually works like a network.\n\n1212\n01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,180\nA lot of people don't realize that\nthey think of it as like USB.\n\n1213\n01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:59,080\nWith USB if I have a USB printer,\nI can only plug it in to one device.\n\n1214\n01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,710\nBut if I have a Firewire printer,\nI can run it to a Firewire hub, and\n\n1215\n01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:05,790\nI can have more than one computer plugged\nin to that hub and they can all share\n\n1216\n01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:09,700\nthe printer at the same time,\nbecause Firewire functions like a network.\n\n1217\n01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,300\nAnd so that's why it shows up right\nhere under my network adapters.\n\n1218\n01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,860\nI've got a bluetooth personal\narea network, all right.\n\n1219\n01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:20,420\nIf I've got computers that both\nhave bluetooth, they can connect\n\n1220\n01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:24,070\nto each other via bluetooth and build,\nthey call it an ad hoc network, right.\n\n1221\n01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:25,870\nA network on the fly and\nthey can communicate.\n\n1222\n01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:27,270\nI do this with my iPad sometimes.\n\n1223\n01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:29,760\nI'll connect it up to the laptop\nvia the bluetooth pan.\n\n1224\n01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:34,110\nAnd then lastly I've got\nthis Thunderbolt bridge.\n\n1225\n01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:38,050\nI've never actually used this one, but if\nyou have two Macs with thunderbolt ports\n\n1226\n01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:42,910\non them, you can run a thunderbolt cable\nbetween them and it will build a bridge,\n\n1227\n01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:45,780\na simple point to point connection\nbetween the two systems so\n\n1228\n01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,480\nyou have very fast network transfers.\n\n1229\n01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,840\nYou can almost say it was lightening fast.\n\n1230\n01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,120\nSee what I did there?\n\n1231\n01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:55,373\n[LAUGH] A really fast communication\nbetween the two Macs all via that\n\n1232\n01:05:55,373 --> 01:05:58,360\nthunderbolt port, so\nthat's why that one shows up.\n\n1233\n01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,050\nThese are all different types\nof connections that you may or\n\n1234\n01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:03,380\nmay not have in your system\ndepending on what you do.\n\n1235\n01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,540\nI think I probably connect to more network\nadaptors than most people do on a normal\n\n1236\n01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,530\nbasis, but\nyou might have more than me, right.\n\n1237\n01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:10,040\nDifferent people have different needs.\n\n1238\n01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,290\nAnd that's the real\nadvantage of this screen.\n\n1239\n01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:15,060\nNow all the ones that I detailed\nto you guys right there,\n\n1240\n01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:18,860\nthose were tied to physical\nequipment on my system, right.\n\n1241\n01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:22,420\nThe Thunderbolt connection,\nthat's tied to my Thunderbolt port or\n\n1242\n01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,905\nBluetooth is tied to\nmy Bluetooth antennas.\n\n1243\n01:06:24,905 --> 01:06:26,660\nWi-Fi is tied to my Wi-Fi antennas, right.\n\n1244\n01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:31,650\nBut some of these can be tied\nto virtual connections also.\n\n1245\n01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:33,880\nIf you go to that little plus\nsign down at the bottom,\n\n1246\n01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,450\nyou'll see where you can\nadd in more interfaces.\n\n1247\n01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:40,810\nAnd all these up here at the top, these\nare real, these are physical interfaces.\n\n1248\n01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:48,350\nBut down here at the bottom, VPM, PPvOE,\n6 to 4, those are virtual tunnels.\n\n1249\n01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:51,460\nVPN's.\nThat's a virtual private network.\n\n1250\n01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,670\nWith a virtual private network\nwe build an encrypted,\n\n1251\n01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:59,460\nsecured tunnel between our laptop or\ndesktop and another system somewhere else.\n\n1252\n01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,695\nAnd that encrypted tunnel makes it\nthe equivalent of having a direct\n\n1253\n01:07:02,695 --> 01:07:05,945\ncable running between us and\nthem that's nice and secure and safe.\n\n1254\n01:07:07,501 --> 01:07:08,244\nPPPoE.\n\n1255\n01:07:08,244 --> 01:07:11,420\nThat's point-to-point\nprotocol over Ethernet.\n\n1256\n01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:17,950\nWhen you plug into an Ethernet network, by\ndefault, you just plug in and you're on.\n\n1257\n01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:20,480\nBut, some people like to\nadd on authentication.\n\n1258\n01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,490\nWhen you plug into the network,\n\n1259\n01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:23,280\nyou've gotta provide a username and\npassword to connect.\n\n1260\n01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,030\nYou see this with DSL a lot.\n\n1261\n01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:28,760\nAnd so for those,\nthey do PPP over ethernet and\n\n1262\n01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,480\nthey use the authentication Ps for\npoint to point protocol.\n\n1263\n01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,320\nSo if I have to connect to that,\nI've gotta add that option in so\n\n1264\n01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,910\nI can provide a username and password.\n\n1265\n01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,370\nAnd then the last one is 6 to 4.\n\n1266\n01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:42,040\nThat is a IPv6 to IPv4 tunnel.\n\n1267\n01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:46,180\nRemember how I mentioned that\nmost Internet service providers\n\n1268\n01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:48,640\ndon't have support for IPv6?\n\n1269\n01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,850\nWell if my network support IPv6 and\n\n1270\n01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:57,320\nyour network supports IPv6 and\nthe Internet is in between us with IPv4.\n\n1271\n01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:02,250\nWe could build a 6 to 4 tunnel\nwhere I take my IPv6 traffic,\n\n1272\n01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:06,160\nhide it inside of IPv4,\nsend it across the Internet to you, and\n\n1273\n01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,310\nyou unwrap it and release it as\nIPv6 traffic on your network.\n\n1274\n01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:11,240\nRight?\nThat's a 6 to 4 tunnel.\n\n1275\n01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,230\nThose are virtual interfaces and\nwe can add them in.\n\n1276\n01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:16,540\nThe only one they really hit on,\non the exam, is VPN.\n\n1277\n01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:21,400\nAnd the key thing to remember for\nthe exam is which VPN types they support.\n\n1278\n01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,540\nWith a virtual private network, you can\ninstall VPN clients on your Mac and\n\n1279\n01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:27,920\nget support for\nall sorts of different protocols.\n\n1280\n01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,460\nFor example, I like to use open VPN.\n\n1281\n01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,220\nAnd Mac doesn't support that natively.\n\n1282\n01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:34,660\nSo I run a little client\nup here called viscosity.\n\n1283\n01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:38,210\nAnd viscosity supports open VPN, and\nI throw it on there and I use it.\n\n1284\n01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:44,840\nBut native in the OS we have support for\nlayer 2 tunneling protocol or L2TP.\n\n1285\n01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,700\nWe have some word for PPTP the point\nto point tunneling protocol, and\n\n1286\n01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:53,490\nwe have support for Cisco IPsec.\n\n1287\n01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:55,610\nIPsec is Internet protocol security and\n\n1288\n01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:58,480\nthis is Cisco's implementation of it,\nall right.\n\n1289\n01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,725\nNow, in real life land,\nYou do not wanna use PPTP.\n\n1290\n01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:04,940\nPoint-to-Point Tunneling Protocol\nis a very weak encryption.\n\n1291\n01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,450\nIt's only 40 bit by default.\n\n1292\n01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:07,890\nIt's not very secure.\n\n1293\n01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:09,660\nYou don't wanna use PPTP.\n\n1294\n01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:14,480\nBut the other two, L2TP and Cisco IPSec,\nthose guys are very secure,\n\n1295\n01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:18,100\nvery stable,\ndefinitely protocols that you may use.\n\n1296\n01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,650\nIf you want a protocol\nthat's not here on the list,\n\n1297\n01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:22,840\nyou'll need to install\nthird party software.\n\n1298\n01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:23,370\nRight.\n\n1299\n01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:24,790\nBut they all work basically the same.\n\n1300\n01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:28,020\nYou choose the protocol you want,\nlike I'll choose L2TP, right.\n\n1301\n01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:33,050\nYou give it a name, so this might\nbe like my connection to work, or\n\n1302\n01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:36,010\nI might even call it VPN to work so\nI can remember this is a VPN.\n\n1303\n01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:40,680\nAnd you hit Create, and\nit's gonna add it into my list.\n\n1304\n01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,530\nI can find it right here,\n\n1305\n01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:44,870\nand then I need to specify\nthe server I'm gonna connect to.\n\n1306\n01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:47,910\nSo this will be the IP\naddress of the VPN endpoint.\n\n1307\n01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:50,650\nThe user name that I'm\ngonna use to authenticate,\n\n1308\n01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:52,910\nand then my authentication settings.\n\n1309\n01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:56,280\nDo I authenticate with a password,\nwhich is a pre-shared key.\n\n1310\n01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,850\nOr do I authenticate with a certificate?\n\n1311\n01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,870\nI would need to provide that information.\n\n1312\n01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:02,790\nOnce that was done, I could connect\nto that VPN pretty easily, and\n\n1313\n01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:05,040\nyou can add it to\nthe menu bar if you want.\n\n1314\n01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,290\nYou'll see that VPN option right there,\nand\n\n1315\n01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,900\nyou can quickly connect to\na VPN right from your menu bar.\n\n1316\n01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,420\nThat VPN function is built right in.\n\n1317\n01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,070\nJust be familiar with that basic process.\n\n1318\n01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:16,180\nOn the exam they're not gonna\nhave you set up a VPN server or\n\n1319\n01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,740\nanything like that, you just need\nto understand the client side.\n\n1320\n01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:21,838\nPunch in the server IP, punch in user\nname and password, and you're done.\n\n1321\n01:10:25,273 --> 01:10:27,709\nAll right.\nNow these network adapters,\n\n1322\n01:10:27,709 --> 01:10:32,780\nthe order that they're listed\nin is kind of important, right.\n\n1323\n01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:39,030\nNotice how my Thunderbolt ethernet adapter\nis listed above my WiFi adapter, okay.\n\n1324\n01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:40,060\nWhy is that?\n\n1325\n01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:44,390\nWell this is the order these\nconnections are preferred in.\n\n1326\n01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:47,190\nIt'll always list the active\nadapters at the top, and\n\n1327\n01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:48,290\nthe inactive ones at the bottom.\n\n1328\n01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:52,480\nYou're never gonna prefer an inactive\nadapter over an active one.\n\n1329\n01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:57,190\nBut the active ones are listed in the\norder that are preferred, and your Mac OS\n\n1330\n01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:03,260\nsystems will prefer a physical connection\nto a wireless connection any day.\n\n1331\n01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:07,310\nWireless connections are great but they're\nnot as fast as physical connections and\n\n1332\n01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:08,770\nthey're not as reliable.\n\n1333\n01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:11,630\nWe can have congestion, we can move\ntoo far from the access point and\n\n1334\n01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:12,990\nthe connection gets flaky but\n\n1335\n01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:16,260\nif you're plugged in,\nthat's the best connection you can get.\n\n1336\n01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:20,230\nSo if you're like me, my laptop, I've\ngot a wireless and a wired adapter and\n\n1337\n01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:22,170\nthey're both connected\nto the same network.\n\n1338\n01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:23,790\nThey're both connected to 10.1.230.\n\n1339\n01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:25,810\nSo which does the device use?\n\n1340\n01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:28,100\nIt picks that physical adapter.\n\n1341\n01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,590\nWell you can override that if you want.\n\n1342\n01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:32,610\nYou can tell it the order\nyou want it to prefer.\n\n1343\n01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:38,500\nIf you hit the little gear icon down here,\nyou'll see in here Set Service Order.\n\n1344\n01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,830\nThat Set Service Order,\nthat's where you define.\n\n1345\n01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,910\nThe order of preference for these.\n\n1346\n01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:45,380\nAnd you just drag and drop things.\n\n1347\n01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:50,070\nNow, this is not representative of\nwhether things are active or inactive.\n\n1348\n01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,190\nThis is just all of them.\n\n1349\n01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:55,395\nSo assuming that all of your\nadaptors went active at once?\n\n1350\n01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:57,355\nWhich ones do you wanna prefer?\n\n1351\n01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:59,105\nSo, my thunderbolt ethernet?\n\n1352\n01:11:59,105 --> 01:12:00,175\nI might wanna prefer that.\n\n1353\n01:12:00,175 --> 01:12:01,175\nNumber one.\n\n1354\n01:12:01,175 --> 01:12:03,548\nI always wanna use that\nThunderbolt ethernet adaptor.\n\n1355\n01:12:03,548 --> 01:12:06,220\nSo I'll drag it and\nstick it up at the top, all right.\n\n1356\n01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:09,085\nAnd then maybe wifi comes in...\n\n1357\n01:12:09,085 --> 01:12:10,382\nSecond place.\n\n1358\n01:12:10,382 --> 01:12:14,937\nWell, that's good if I'm up here at\nthe podium, but when I go back to my desk,\n\n1359\n01:12:14,937 --> 01:12:17,920\nI wanna make sure that I\nuse my wired adapter there.\n\n1360\n01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,440\nWell, that's this USB or\nAX88179, these guys.\n\n1361\n01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:27,260\nAnd so I might choose to move\nthose up above WiFi, right?\n\n1362\n01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,720\nSo that I prefer those.\n\n1363\n01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,860\nI'm gonna use these guys first.\n\n1364\n01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:32,770\nIf they're not available,\nthen I'll use WiFi.\n\n1365\n01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:36,910\nAnd then after that I've got\nthat USB serial controller.\n\n1366\n01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:39,310\nI've got some other USB\nnetwork connection,\n\n1367\n01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:41,790\nI might wanna move that above WiFi.\n\n1368\n01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:45,240\nAnd then my thunderbolt firewire,\nbluetooth pan, and\n\n1369\n01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,870\nthunderbolt bridge beneath that.\n\n1370\n01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:50,050\nSo now I start to set my preferences and\nI prefer that.\n\n1371\n01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:53,130\nAnd when that's done,\nthat'll take effect over here and\n\n1372\n01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:55,202\ninfluence which ones get priority.\n\n1373\n01:12:55,202 --> 01:12:56,820\nAll right.\n\n1374\n01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:59,940\nSo, it's really updating the routing\ntables on the back end to say you've got\n\n1375\n01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:02,010\nthis default router and\nhere's where you gonna go.\n\n1376\n01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:05,630\nThis interface or that interface,\nsome kind of preferencing it there.\n\n1377\n01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:07,765\nSo pretty interesting\nthat we can set that.\n\n1378\n01:13:07,765 --> 01:13:11,960\n[COUGH] All right, some of the other\nthings that we need to be aware of.\n\n1379\n01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,470\nLet's see, we talked about DNS.\n\n1380\n01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:15,110\nWe talked a little bit\nabout MAC addresses.\n\n1381\n01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,780\nThere is one thing I do need to point out.\n\n1382\n01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:21,110\nI showed you guys how to get a MAC\naddress for your wired connection.\n\n1383\n01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:24,570\nSo I chose my Thunderbolt connection\nhere and I went to Advanced.\n\n1384\n01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:28,790\nAnd I went to Hardware, and there was\nthat MAC address right there, right?\n\n1385\n01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:31,300\nIt's a little bit different for wireless.\n\n1386\n01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,080\nIf I choose the wireless adapter and\n\n1387\n01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,670\nI go to Advanced, well I can see\nthat Hardware page right there.\n\n1388\n01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:39,940\nI can jump in and\nI can see that MAC address, but\n\n1389\n01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:41,990\nthe screens are a little bit different.\n\n1390\n01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:43,670\nNotice here under WiFi,\n\n1391\n01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:48,170\nI don't see my IP address options right\nunder my main status pane, right?\n\n1392\n01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:50,820\nThings are different here\nbecause WiFi is different.\n\n1393\n01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:54,490\nWith a physical network,\nyou plug a cable in and you're connected.\n\n1394\n01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:58,370\nBut with WiFi you've got to run through\nsome different connection steps.\n\n1395\n01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:01,970\nAnd so I wanna talk about those connection\nsteps and kinda demonstrate what they do\n\n1396\n01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:05,090\nand walk you that, but I'm a little\nshort on time on this segment.\n\n1397\n01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:09,530\nSo, let's pause here and when we get back\nwe'll take a look at wireless networks,\n\n1398\n01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:11,300\nthen we'll start to wrap\nthings up from there.\n\n1399\n01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,411\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n1400\n01:14:13,411 --> 01:14:17,220\n[MUSIC]\n\n1401\n01:14:20,401 --> 01:14:22,330\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1402\n01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:25,160\nSo in the previous segment I started\nto talk about wireless and how\n\n1403\n01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:29,330\nwireless networks have a different type\nof configuration from our wired networks.\n\n1404\n01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:32,430\nThe wired network you just plug in and\nthey work, right?\n\n1405\n01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:35,840\nWired networks don't normally mess around\nwith you as far as authentication and\n\n1406\n01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,640\nall that.\n\n1407\n01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,475\nThey can, right we talked about PPP\nover ethernet, this is one example.\n\n1408\n01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:44,646\nThere's actually another one I\ndidn't talk about, which is 802.1X.\n\n1409\n01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:47,630\nWhen you configure a wired network,\n\n1410\n01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:51,910\nyou can use 802.1X which is a standard for\ndoing authentication.\n\n1411\n01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:55,709\nTo require that computer to provide a user\nname and password or a certificate,\n\n1412\n01:14:55,709 --> 01:14:58,662\nto validate that computer's\nallowed to be one the network.\n\n1413\n01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:02,733\nWhile 802.1X actually was developed for\nthe wireless world and\n\n1414\n01:15:02,733 --> 01:15:05,140\nthen adopted by the wired world.\n\n1415\n01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:08,930\nSo in wireless, having authentication\nlike that is pretty commonplace, and\n\n1416\n01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:11,160\nthe authentication is going\nto take one of two forms.\n\n1417\n01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,534\nIt well I guess there\ncould be a third form,\n\n1418\n01:15:12,534 --> 01:15:13,960\nwhich is to not have\nauthentication at all.\n\n1419\n01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,960\nYou can have an open wireless network,\n\n1420\n01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,130\none that anybody can connect\nto without credentials.\n\n1421\n01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:20,510\nNot the greatest idea, but you can do it.\n\n1422\n01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:23,580\nIf you wanna authenticate though,\nwe have two choices.\n\n1423\n01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,640\nChoice number one is to use a password.\n\n1424\n01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:28,690\nNow that's called a pre-shared key.\n\n1425\n01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,410\nIt's a key right?\n\n1426\n01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:32,030\nIt's like an encryption key, or\na decryption key in this case.\n\n1427\n01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:34,790\nAnd it's a key that you have\nto give to people in order for\n\n1428\n01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:36,310\nthem to connect to the wireless.\n\n1429\n01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:39,830\nWell, if you give your\nkey out to 50 people and\n\n1430\n01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:43,930\nthen one of those people, one of those\nperson is doing something bad, and\n\n1431\n01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:46,470\nyou want to cut off their access,\nyou change the key.\n\n1432\n01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:50,590\nBut that affects all 50 people, so\nit doesn't give you very granular control.\n\n1433\n01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:54,900\nThose keys are great for home users, but\nthey are not so great for businesses.\n\n1434\n01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:58,310\nIf you're a business, you would be\nable to cut off individual people.\n\n1435\n01:15:58,310 --> 01:16:01,760\nAnd so a better way to go about it,\nis to do certificate based authentication.\n\n1436\n01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,830\nAnd with certificates, you basically\nissue out a certificate to every\n\n1437\n01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:08,980\nsingle computer, iPhone,\nwhatever it is that's on your network.\n\n1438\n01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:11,630\nAnd then when they connect,\nthey show that certificate saying hey,\n\n1439\n01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:12,960\nI'm allowed to connect.\n\n1440\n01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,200\nThe cool part there is that if an employee\ngets terminated, or somebody's doing\n\n1441\n01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:21,680\nmalicious activity, you can go in and\ndisable just that one certificate.\n\n1442\n01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,420\nThey call it revoking the certificate.\n\n1443\n01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:26,780\nAnd now they don't have access, and it\ndoesn't impact anyone else on the network.\n\n1444\n01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:29,640\nThe problem is,\nif you want to issue certificates,\n\n1445\n01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:32,510\nyou have to have what's called a PKI,\na public key infrastructure.\n\n1446\n01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:34,937\nIt's a couple of servers,\nit's a lot of software,\n\n1447\n01:16:34,937 --> 01:16:38,630\nit's not something that a home or\nsmall business is going to have.\n\n1448\n01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:40,140\nSo most people don't do it.\n\n1449\n01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,890\nBut if you're in a business or\nan enterprise, you will.\n\n1450\n01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:45,330\nSo, when we go to configure\na wireless network,\n\n1451\n01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:47,390\nthose are things we need to think\nabout when we're connecting.\n\n1452\n01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:49,470\nWhat do we need to get connected?\n\n1453\n01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:50,580\nLet me show you.\n\n1454\n01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:54,620\nSo, here I am in my system preferences,\nand in the network preferences and\n\n1455\n01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:56,245\nI've got my WiFi adaptor selected.\n\n1456\n01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:59,100\nI've got a button to turn WiFi on and off.\n\n1457\n01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:02,240\nNice to be able to turn WiFi off when your\nnot using it if your on like an airplane\n\n1458\n01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,810\nsometimes they make you turn it off so\nwe've got that option but\n\n1459\n01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:05,650\nusually we just leave it on.\n\n1460\n01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:10,330\nAnd then after that I see\nwhat network I'm connected\n\n1461\n01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:13,750\nto now I'm connected to a network right\nnow let me just get disconnected and\n\n1462\n01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:16,740\nactually you know what its not gonna\nlet me disconnect from there but\n\n1463\n01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,590\nit will stay connected and that's fine.\n\n1464\n01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:23,110\nSo what I see right here is a list of\nthe various networks that are available.\n\n1465\n01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:25,000\nMy system is doing a scan and\n\n1466\n01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,750\nit's showing all the different\nwireless networks that are out there.\n\n1467\n01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:31,600\nI'm connected to one called ITProTV 5 GhZ,\nright?\n\n1468\n01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,490\nSo that's the network I'm connected to.\n\n1469\n01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:36,480\nAnd see how it's got a little\nwireless symbol here and a lock.\n\n1470\n01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,780\nThat lets me know there's security\non this network that I have to\n\n1471\n01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,610\nhave authentication\ncredentials connect to it.\n\n1472\n01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:44,630\nThere's other networks\nlike this one right here.\n\n1473\n01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:47,960\nIt's an HP printer and it has no lock.\n\n1474\n01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:48,970\nIt's an open network.\n\n1475\n01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:52,300\nAnybody could connect to that\none without credentials, right?\n\n1476\n01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:55,040\nSo, that's an open versus a secured.\n\n1477\n01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:55,960\nNow, if it's secured,\n\n1478\n01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,900\nit doesn't tell me much more about it\nas far as credentials or whatever.\n\n1479\n01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,510\nI will need to provide\nthat when I connect.\n\n1480\n01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:06,300\nIf I choose one like\nthe to be two 2.4 GhZ,\n\n1481\n01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,350\nhere it's prompting me for credentials.\n\n1482\n01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:12,379\nIt's telling me that it\nrequires a WPA2 password.\n\n1483\n01:18:12,379 --> 01:18:15,570\nWell, when you go to connect to\na wireless network there's really\n\n1484\n01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:18,320\nthree standards of encryption\nthat are available.\n\n1485\n01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,592\nTheres WEP,\nthe wired equivalency protocol.\n\n1486\n01:18:20,592 --> 01:18:21,570\nAll right.\n\n1487\n01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:23,940\nAnd that protocol's been broken.\n\n1488\n01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:25,780\nThe cipher code that was used for it.\n\n1489\n01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:28,380\nIt used a weak algorithm and\nit's been cracked.\n\n1490\n01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:32,735\nAnd so, somebody can actually reverse the\nencryption if they monitor your connection\n\n1491\n01:18:32,735 --> 01:18:34,255\nlong enough, it's not reliable.\n\n1492\n01:18:34,255 --> 01:18:37,575\nSo you don't see WEP very often any more.\n\n1493\n01:18:37,575 --> 01:18:41,135\nThen there's WPA which is\nWi-Fi Protected Access.\n\n1494\n01:18:41,135 --> 01:18:45,515\nIt replaces WEP with a much\nstronger level of encryption.\n\n1495\n01:18:45,515 --> 01:18:47,115\nSo WPA is seen more commonly.\n\n1496\n01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:52,470\nBut then WPA2, which is the newer version,\nI say newer it's been out like 15 years,\n\n1497\n01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:55,400\nbut this one uses a much\nstronger level of encryption.\n\n1498\n01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,730\nIt uses AES, and\nthat gives us a higher degree of security.\n\n1499\n01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:02,890\nSo WPA2 is pretty much what you're\ngonna see out there in the real world.\n\n1500\n01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:05,680\nUnless somebody specifically has\nequipment that doesn't support it,\n\n1501\n01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:06,340\nthey might be doing WPA.\n\n1502\n01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:08,600\nBut you really shouldn't see WEP anymore.\n\n1503\n01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,910\nNow notice how it's asking me for\na password.\n\n1504\n01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:14,560\nThat lets me know that this\nnetwork is using a pre-shared key,\n\n1505\n01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,540\nit's not using a certificate.\n\n1506\n01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:20,080\nIf it was using a certificate, then it\neither wouldn't have prompted me at all,\n\n1507\n01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,360\nit would've just let me on\nif I had the certificate.\n\n1508\n01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,830\nOr it would have prompted me for\na username and a password.\n\n1509\n01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:29,150\nWe can combine certificate based\nauthentication with username and password.\n\n1510\n01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:33,060\nThat's a function of 802.1X that lets\nyou do that type of authentication.\n\n1511\n01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:37,420\nIn my case it's just a pre-shared key so\nI would just type in what that key is.\n\n1512\n01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:38,500\nLet's see if I can remember it.\n\n1513\n01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:43,910\nAnd then I can join it now if I choose to\nremember the network my laptop will always\n\n1514\n01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:47,120\nreconnect to it whenever it sees\nthat wireless network available.\n\n1515\n01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,420\nI'll go ahead and join it, and now in\nthe background its connecting see my WiFi\n\n1516\n01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:54,150\nadapter just turned yellow,\nand then its gonna connect and\n\n1517\n01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:58,320\nits trying to get an IP address right\nnow see how it says no IP address?\n\n1518\n01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,177\nSo it's using DHCP, or I assume it is,\nto try and get an address.\n\n1519\n01:20:02,177 --> 01:20:05,245\nAnd if it gets one,\nthen this will turn green and\n\n1520\n01:20:05,245 --> 01:20:07,713\nit'll move up in my list of adaptors.\n\n1521\n01:20:07,713 --> 01:20:10,852\nNow it takes longer than a Wired Network.\n\n1522\n01:20:10,852 --> 01:20:14,100\nWith a wired network,\nyou plug right in and you're ready to go.\n\n1523\n01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,760\nOn a wireless network,\nwe have that negotiation for\n\n1524\n01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,630\nencryption that takes just a moment.\n\n1525\n01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:21,270\nAnd then there we go,\nlooks like I got a self assigned IP, so\n\n1526\n01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:23,980\nI actually didn't get an IP address\non the network for some reason.\n\n1527\n01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:26,390\nI'll take a look and\nsee what happened there.\n\n1528\n01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:29,530\nBut it looks like it's just\nassigned myself an IP and moved up.\n\n1529\n01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:35,150\nNow, normally,\nthis is the process we're gonna follow.\n\n1530\n01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:37,230\nYou can use the System Preferences for\nthis.\n\n1531\n01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:39,940\nYou also have your menu bar up top.\n\n1532\n01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,370\nYou have a wireless symbol up there and\n\n1533\n01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:43,480\nyou can choose between your\nwireless networks there.\n\n1534\n01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,880\nThat's usually a little bit quicker,\nso you can just jump through and\n\n1535\n01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:49,900\nselect those and\nbe in business pretty easy to jump around.\n\n1536\n01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:52,490\nThis screen is nice because you get a\nlittle status message that tells you like\n\n1537\n01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:54,740\nhere I've got no internet connection.\n\n1538\n01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,020\nIt's telling me there's a problem.\n\n1539\n01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:59,980\nI am connected to the Wireless Network but\nI'm not able to get out to the internet.\n\n1540\n01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,350\nAnd I can see why right here.\n\n1541\n01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:03,280\nI have a Self-assigned IP.\n\n1542\n01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:07,560\nFor some reason, I didn't get\na response from the DHCP server.\n\n1543\n01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:11,530\nThe DHCP server didn't give me an address\nlike it was supposed to, all right?\n\n1544\n01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:16,100\nAnd if I go into my Advanced screen here,\nI should see that.\n\n1545\n01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:22,280\nUnder Advanced, if I go to TCP/IP I can\nsee that I got this 169.254 address.\n\n1546\n01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:25,065\nAny time you see 169.254,\nthat's a fake address.\n\n1547\n01:21:25,065 --> 01:21:27,620\nIt's one that your computer made up.\n\n1548\n01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:31,189\nIf you can't contact a DHCP server,\nyou'll make up an IP address,\n\n1549\n01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:33,329\nand it'll start with 169.254.\n\n1550\n01:21:33,329 --> 01:21:36,433\nIf there's other computers,\nthey'll make up an address also, and\n\n1551\n01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,880\nyou might be able to talk to them.\n\n1552\n01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,560\nBut the main problem we have with\nthat address is there's no Router.\n\n1553\n01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,230\nSo I won't be able to get\nto any other Network.\n\n1554\n01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:45,280\nI won't be able to get to the Internet.\n\n1555\n01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,710\nThat's why the error message up here\nis saying No Internet Connection.\n\n1556\n01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:50,530\nThe problem isn't that I don't\nhave an Internet connection.\n\n1557\n01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:52,360\nThe problem is that I don't have a Router.\n\n1558\n01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,990\nRight?\nSo it's a little bit of a Misnomer there.\n\n1559\n01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:57,600\nBut to an end user that's\nwhat's important, and\n\n1560\n01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,770\nI've decided they can't\nget to the internet.\n\n1561\n01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:02,210\nSo, that's why the messages are different,\nbut that's my main problem.\n\n1562\n01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:06,280\nNow, if you can't contact the DHCP server,\nit could have just been a fluke.\n\n1563\n01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:10,600\nIt could be that for\nsome reason I sent out my message and\n\n1564\n01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,760\nmaybe that wireless signal\njust didn't make it.\n\n1565\n01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:16,670\nYour system will actually try three times,\nbut maybe it just failed all three times.\n\n1566\n01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:22,280\nSo you can force it to try again by\ncoming here and saying renew DHCP lease.\n\n1567\n01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,174\nIf you hit that, it's gonna try again and\n\n1568\n01:22:24,174 --> 01:22:27,493\nnow it's gonna reach out to that server\nand try and get another address.\n\n1569\n01:22:27,493 --> 01:22:32,400\nIn my case I can see where it failed\nto do that, it just went right back.\n\n1570\n01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,960\nNow, it failed really fast so I don't\nthink it tried very hard and if we wait.\n\n1571\n01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,830\nThere we go, now it's trying again.\n\n1572\n01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:40,390\nI said it would try three times.\n\n1573\n01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:44,410\nSo it's gonna try again and again and\nsee if it can contact that server, and\n\n1574\n01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:44,910\nget an address.\n\n1575\n01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:49,390\nNow, I've actually\ncreated a scenario here.\n\n1576\n01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:52,310\nI use a reservation for my IP address.\n\n1577\n01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:53,200\nThose two networks,\n\n1578\n01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,810\nthe ITPRO TV 5 gigahertz and 2.4\ngigahertz are actually the same network.\n\n1579\n01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:58,630\nIt's the same network\nthat I'm connecting to.\n\n1580\n01:22:58,630 --> 01:23:00,940\nIt's just they're at\ndifferent frequency ranges.\n\n1581\n01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:05,170\nAnd my DSAP reservation was tied\nto the 5 giga hertz network.\n\n1582\n01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:09,080\nNow I've jumped over to the 2.4 and so\nit's not moving my reservation over.\n\n1583\n01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,480\nSo I'm never going to get an address for\nmy server.\n\n1584\n01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,990\nMy server's perfectly happy.\n\n1585\n01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:15,900\nI'm just doing something I shouldn't\nbe doing with my wireless adapter.\n\n1586\n01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:21,520\nSo another way to test this, to say,\nall right, is the problem the DACP server.\n\n1587\n01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,340\nWe could switch to a manual IP.\n\n1588\n01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:26,730\nI could come in here and\nsay let me go manual.\n\n1589\n01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:28,749\nI'll specify an address on that network.\n\n1590\n01:23:28,749 --> 01:23:36,279\nMaybe I'll do 10.1.230.251 or I'll do 242.\n\n1591\n01:23:36,279 --> 01:23:37,790\nThere we go.\n\n1592\n01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:40,320\nI'm trying not to bump into\nanybody else on my network.\n\n1593\n01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:44,970\nAnd I'll punch in the other\ninformation from my network manually.\n\n1594\n01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:46,990\nPunching it in manually I'm\nnot using the DHCP server.\n\n1595\n01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:50,150\nSo this is gonna let me identify,\nis the problem the network.\n\n1596\n01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,610\nAm I not able to communicate?\n\n1597\n01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:53,940\nOr is the problem just the DHCP server.\n\n1598\n01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:58,530\nIf this works, then the problem's with\nthe DHCP server, if this doesn't work,\n\n1599\n01:23:58,530 --> 01:24:01,580\nif I still can't communicate then\nthe problem is with the network,\n\n1600\n01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:05,000\nthere's something wrong with that wireless\nnetwork, and I'm not able to communicate.\n\n1601\n01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,580\nI'm going to go ahead and hit OK on that,\nand apply so it takes effect.\n\n1602\n01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:12,650\nNow, my Physical Network Adaptor\nis going to take priority.\n\n1603\n01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:14,300\nSo, I'm going to unplug that one,\n\n1604\n01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,980\nI'm just going to unplug my\nPhysical Network Adapter, there we go.\n\n1605\n01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,800\nSo that my WiFi is the only\nthing that's connected.\n\n1606\n01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,560\nSo now I either connect wireless or\nI don't connect.\n\n1607\n01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:27,640\nNotice up here, in my Menu bar,\nthe no Internet Connection just appeared.\n\n1608\n01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:30,360\nIt's probably communicating but\nlet's just test that out.\n\n1609\n01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,800\nI'll go back into my Network Utility and\n\n1610\n01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:36,600\nI'll just do a quick ping to\nsee if I can ping our firewall.\n\n1611\n01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,505\nAnd I'm getting a message\nhere saying no Route to host.\n\n1612\n01:24:40,505 --> 01:24:42,095\nI don't have a Route to get to the host.\n\n1613\n01:24:42,095 --> 01:24:48,032\nNow, that's a little odd,\nI'm pinging 10.1.230.1,\n\n1614\n01:24:48,032 --> 01:24:52,860\nand my own IP address was 10.1.230.242.\n\n1615\n01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,460\nI shouldn't need a route for that right?\n\n1616\n01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,270\nIt’s on the same network that I'm on.\n\n1617\n01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:58,320\nSo let’s double check some\nof that information and\n\n1618\n01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,860\nthis might be one of those\nscenarios where I didn't hit apply.\n\n1619\n01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:03,150\nAlthough, I was pretty sure I did.\n\n1620\n01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:04,430\nYep I did.\n\n1621\n01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:05,590\nI'm gonna close out of that.\n\n1622\n01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:09,090\nAnd let me get back in\nto my Network Utilities,\n\n1623\n01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:12,370\nwhen it says there's no Route available,\nhow do we know what Routes we have?\n\n1624\n01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:15,990\nWell, in the Network Utility we\ncan go to Netstat, and we can say,\n\n1625\n01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:18,750\ndisplay routing table information.\n\n1626\n01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:20,850\nAnd I should have a route\nin here somewhere\n\n1627\n01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:25,226\nthat matches the 10.1.230 network.\n\n1628\n01:25:25,226 --> 01:25:31,220\nAnd I can see it right here 10.1.230/24\nis available via link number 4, right?\n\n1629\n01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:34,070\nAnd it's listing EN0 on the far side.\n\n1630\n01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:38,290\nNow, I actually don't remember if\nmy Wireless Adapter is EN0 or EN7.\n\n1631\n01:25:38,290 --> 01:25:41,960\nI thought it was EN7, but I'm gonna look\ndown the list and look for 10.1.230.241,\n\n1632\n01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:49,780\nthat was the static IP I assigned to\nmyself, or I think I did 242 there it is.\n\n1633\n01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:52,700\n10.1.230.242, so I see that one and\nI can see that it's tied to EN0, so\n\n1634\n01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:55,115\nI was actually wrong earlier.\n\n1635\n01:25:55,115 --> 01:25:56,605\nEN0 is my Wireless Adapter.\n\n1636\n01:25:56,605 --> 01:25:58,800\nEN7 must have been my physical one.\n\n1637\n01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:03,980\nSo I can see the IP address tied to\nthat adapter and my Default Route\n\n1638\n01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,480\nis going out that adapter, so everything\nlooks good in the routing table.\n\n1639\n01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:10,020\nSo, I may have just gone\na little too fast and\n\n1640\n01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:13,140\nthe Network didn't have time\nto set those values in place.\n\n1641\n01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,275\nI'm going to verify this from\nthe Command Prompt also.\n\n1642\n01:26:15,275 --> 01:26:19,660\nI\"m going to try and ping that\nfirewall and see if we get through.\n\n1643\n01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:21,430\nAnd I'm still not getting through.\n\n1644\n01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:26,990\nSo in this scenario,\nI've got a manual IP address set but,\n\n1645\n01:26:26,990 --> 01:26:30,120\nI can't actually communicate.\n\n1646\n01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:34,260\nSo the problem is probably not\nthe DACP server after all but\n\n1647\n01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:38,150\nthe fact that I can't communicate\nover this 2.4 gigahertz network,\n\n1648\n01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:40,700\nthere's something wrong with\nthe 2.4 gigahertz network,\n\n1649\n01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:46,241\nit's making it where I can't communicate\neven to a local host, right here.\n\n1650\n01:26:46,241 --> 01:26:49,740\nSo, if we have another device,\nwe could test that, right?\n\n1651\n01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:51,950\nI could say my cell phone or\nsome other device and\n\n1652\n01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:55,430\nconnect that 2.4 gigahertz network and\nsee if it exhibits the same problem.\n\n1653\n01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:56,110\nAll right?\n\n1654\n01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:59,920\nIf it does, then we know the problem\nis with the Wireless Access point.\n\n1655\n01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,950\nIf the other device works fine then,\n\n1656\n01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:06,310\nit might actually be an issue with my\nlaptop and I've gotta find out why.\n\n1657\n01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:08,570\nWell, my laptop supports both 2.4 and\n5 gigahertz, so\n\n1658\n01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:11,230\nI can always just jump\nover to the 5 gigahertz.\n\n1659\n01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:13,010\nAnd I know that one was working.\n\n1660\n01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:18,060\nAnd we communicate and things are fine but\nremember I set that static IP.\n\n1661\n01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:19,318\nIf I go back into my network settings.\n\n1662\n01:27:20,459 --> 01:27:25,290\nAnd I go into WiFi I just switch\nto that 5 gigahertz network.\n\n1663\n01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:30,010\nAnd if I go to advanced and into TCP/IP\nthere's that static IP still set.\n\n1664\n01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:33,890\nWhen you set a static IP like that.\n\n1665\n01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:37,100\nIt's tied to the Wireless Adapter,\n\n1666\n01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:40,650\nnot to the wireless network\nthat's important to remember.\n\n1667\n01:27:40,650 --> 01:27:43,250\nStatic IP's are tied to\nthe wireless adapter.\n\n1668\n01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:48,375\nOn that main screen, here,\nI'm seeing the Wireless Network.\n\n1669\n01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:51,260\nThat name that I'm seeing right there,\nthat's called the SSID,\n\n1670\n01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:52,890\nthe Service Set Identifier.\n\n1671\n01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:55,030\nThat's identifying that network.\n\n1672\n01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:58,334\nAnd when you set up a Wireless Access\npoint they broadcast that name out over\n\n1673\n01:27:58,334 --> 01:28:00,756\nand over again to let people\nknow that it's out there.\n\n1674\n01:28:00,756 --> 01:28:02,848\nAnd so I'm picking that name.\n\n1675\n01:28:02,848 --> 01:28:06,252\nThe IP address is not\ntied to that name though.\n\n1676\n01:28:06,252 --> 01:28:07,894\nAnd so\nthat's where I end up with a problem.\n\n1677\n01:28:07,894 --> 01:28:11,080\nI might have a static IP that's\nvalid in one place but not another.\n\n1678\n01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,650\nLet me give you a scenario.\n\n1679\n01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:15,710\nLet's say when I'm here at work.\n\n1680\n01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:20,625\nWhen I'm at work, and I'm on\nthe IT Pro TV five gigahertz network,\n\n1681\n01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:24,954\nI want to have 10.1.230.242\nas my IP address.\n\n1682\n01:28:24,954 --> 01:28:26,138\nI want it to be static.\n\n1683\n01:28:26,138 --> 01:28:27,409\nI always want to have that address.\n\n1684\n01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:32,150\nBut when I go home,\nI wanna connect to a different network.\n\n1685\n01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:34,600\nAt home I have this wireless\nnetwork called the Pezets.\n\n1686\n01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,710\nAnd I think it showed up on\none of the other screens.\n\n1687\n01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:39,050\nHere it's only showing one sided tech now.\n\n1688\n01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:40,320\nIf you go under Advance,\n\n1689\n01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,800\nyou'll see other ones that you\nconnected to in other places.\n\n1690\n01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,060\nLike here's the Pezets, so that's my home.\n\n1691\n01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:45,910\nOh which I need to check.\n\n1692\n01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:47,590\nIt says WPA and not WPA2.\n\n1693\n01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:51,070\nI need to reevaluate my home\nnetwork security apparently.\n\n1694\n01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:55,911\nBut, so, you'll see that you can connect,\nwhen I'm at home I don't\n\n1695\n01:28:55,911 --> 01:29:00,355\nwant to connect with\na static IP of 10.1.230.242.\n\n1696\n01:29:00,355 --> 01:29:02,760\nThat works at the office,\nthat doesn't work at home.\n\n1697\n01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:06,260\nWell at home I want to use DATP.\n\n1698\n01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:09,500\nAnd so if I wanna have different\nconfigurations like that,\n\n1699\n01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:12,640\nI can make use of what\nare called network locations.\n\n1700\n01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:15,120\nNetwork locations are an easily\noverlooked feature.\n\n1701\n01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,010\nMost people don't know about it.\n\n1702\n01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:20,730\nUp at the top I've got this location box,\nand it says automatic.\n\n1703\n01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,920\nAnd that's all that's in there.\n\n1704\n01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:25,490\nWhen you have a network location\ndefined you can specify\n\n1705\n01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:28,870\ndifferent network settings based\non where you physically are.\n\n1706\n01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:30,590\nAnd they're called locations.\n\n1707\n01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:34,410\nI can create a location for\nwork and a location for home, and\n\n1708\n01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:38,140\nwhen I'm at work, my wireless adapter\nmight have a static address, and\n\n1709\n01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:41,560\nwhen I'm at home, my wireless adapter\nmight have a dynamic address.\n\n1710\n01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,960\nYou can customize these settings\nbased on where you are.\n\n1711\n01:29:45,410 --> 01:29:49,260\nFor example, let me go back into WiFi and\nI'm gonna put it back to DHCP.\n\n1712\n01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:55,740\nWiFi just said to you,\nit's DHDP There we go.\n\n1713\n01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:57,560\nThat's that disconnected and\nit's in business.\n\n1714\n01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:58,060\nI'm gonna go ahead and apply that.\n\n1715\n01:30:00,176 --> 01:30:02,460\nAnd now it's off trying\nto get an address again.\n\n1716\n01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:05,660\nNow while it's doing that I'm\ngonna go up here to locations.\n\n1717\n01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:07,680\nAnd I'm gonna chose edit locations.\n\n1718\n01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,930\nAnd I'm gonna create two locations.\n\n1719\n01:30:08,930 --> 01:30:15,080\nI'm gonna create a location called work,\nand I'm all create a location called home.\n\n1720\n01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,360\nThose are my two locations.\n\n1721\n01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:21,280\nAnd you can type whatever you want for\nthe names, it doesn't matter.\n\n1722\n01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,080\nAnd now when I go through, I can pick.\n\n1723\n01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:26,470\nLike I'll pick work, and\non work, I'll go to WiFi.\n\n1724\n01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:30,950\nAnd it's got that IT PRO TV\nfive GHz chosen, and\n\n1725\n01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:36,190\nI'll go to Advanced and TCPIP and\nI'm gonna tell it to use that static IP.\n\n1726\n01:30:36,190 --> 01:30:37,912\nI'll set that to manual.\n\n1727\n01:30:37,912 --> 01:30:40,521\n10.1.230.242.\n\n1728\n01:30:40,521 --> 01:30:43,780\nPunch that other information in.\n\n1729\n01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:46,552\nI probably need to add some DNS servers.\n\n1730\n01:30:46,552 --> 01:30:52,580\nI'll add our DNS server and I might\nwanna add things like my DNS suffixes or\n\n1731\n01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:54,170\nwhatever, I can come in and\nadd those, right?\n\n1732\n01:30:54,170 --> 01:30:57,870\nI'm gonna studio.itpro.tv and\nwe add that in, all right?\n\n1733\n01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:02,200\nThat's my setting for work.\n\n1734\n01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,710\nAnd so\nsee how WiFi is now listed as green?\n\n1735\n01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:05,910\nThat's how I want it to\nbe when I'm at work.\n\n1736\n01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:13,060\nThen if I change that to home, notice\nhow WiFi just changed to no IP address.\n\n1737\n01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:16,580\nNow I can choose it, and my network\nname is still just showing the ones that\n\n1738\n01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:19,860\nare here, but it's got the other\nones saved in the background so\n\n1739\n01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:22,500\nit'll know about\nthe pozets when I go home.\n\n1740\n01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:26,538\nAnd I can go into Advanced, and TCPIP and\nI can make sure that's set to DHCP.\n\n1741\n01:31:26,538 --> 01:31:33,660\nAll right, now when I'm home,\nmy wireless will have a DHCP address.\n\n1742\n01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:37,590\nWhen I'm at work,\nmy wireless will have a static IP address.\n\n1743\n01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:40,350\nAll right.\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n1744\n01:31:40,350 --> 01:31:43,160\nWell, how does the laptop know\nwhether I'm at work or home?\n\n1745\n01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,210\nUnfortunately, it doesn't.\n\n1746\n01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:45,900\nIt doesn't know if I'm at work or at home.\n\n1747\n01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,280\nWe have to tell it.\n\n1748\n01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,900\nAnd we can change that right here in\nthe Network System Preferences, but\n\n1749\n01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,270\nhow annoying would that be, right?\n\n1750\n01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:54,170\nEvery time you go to work, you gotta\ngo into system preferences, network,\n\n1751\n01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:55,720\nchange the location.\n\n1752\n01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,300\nApple makes it easy.\n\n1753\n01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:59,280\nWhat they did, is they changed it.\n\n1754\n01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,700\nAnd I'm gonna let that apply and\nI'll get out of it.\n\n1755\n01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:05,720\nThat once you've set up network locations,\n\n1756\n01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,310\nunder your Apple menu\nyou'll have a new item.\n\n1757\n01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:11,440\nThis item location,\nit doesn't show up normally.\n\n1758\n01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,470\nBut as soon as you add your\nfirst location, it'll show up.\n\n1759\n01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:19,500\nAnd now you can go under the location,\nand you can choose home.\n\n1760\n01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,960\nI'm at home,\nnow my wireless is gonna use DHCP.\n\n1761\n01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:26,900\nAnd then I can go back to the Apple and\nI can go to location and work and\n\n1762\n01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:29,310\nnow my wireless is gonna\nuse a static address.\n\n1763\n01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:30,210\nRight.\n\n1764\n01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:34,220\nRight now, I told it I'm at home,\nthat's my location, and so\n\n1765\n01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:37,580\nif I go back into system preferences,\nand network.\n\n1766\n01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:39,928\nAnd I take a look at my WiFi.\n\n1767\n01:32:39,928 --> 01:32:43,414\nI'll go into Advanced, TCPIP, and\n\n1768\n01:32:43,414 --> 01:32:49,267\nI see I got 10.1.230.241,\nand I got it via DHCP.\n\n1769\n01:32:49,267 --> 01:32:52,380\nNow I'm gonna get outta that.\n\n1770\n01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,310\nAnd I'll go back to my Apple menu and\nlocation, and\n\n1771\n01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:58,360\nnow I'll tell it I'm at work.\n\n1772\n01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,100\nNow it knows I'm at work.\n\n1773\n01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:03,540\nAnd if I go back into my\nSystem Preferences Network.\n\n1774\n01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:09,353\nI can choose WiFi Advanced TCPIP.\n\n1775\n01:33:09,353 --> 01:33:10,960\nAnd I can see that I've got my static IP.\n\n1776\n01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,800\n10.1.230.242.\n\n1777\n01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:17,580\nReal easy to quickly move between\nnetwork configurations, and\n\n1778\n01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:18,940\nwe don't have to do anything crazy, right?\n\n1779\n01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:20,420\nYour regular end user can handle that.\n\n1780\n01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:24,810\nHey, when you're at work, go to the Apple\nmenu Location, and choose Work.\n\n1781\n01:33:24,810 --> 01:33:27,070\nWhen you're at home,\ngo to the Apple menu Location, and\n\n1782\n01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:30,180\nchoose Home, every setting will be\nset the way you want it, right?\n\n1783\n01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:33,280\nReally easy way to be able\nto move between those.\n\n1784\n01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:36,760\nAutomatic is the one that's default,\nand there's nothing automatic about it,\n\n1785\n01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:39,260\nit's just the location that\nwas automatically created, and\n\n1786\n01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:42,490\nall of your adapters are tied to it, and\nthey're all set to DHCP by default, and\n\n1787\n01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:46,650\nyou can go and change that,\nhowever you want all right.\n\n1788\n01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:48,170\nActually, I'm not sure if you\ncan delete the automatic one.\n\n1789\n01:33:48,170 --> 01:33:48,860\nLet's test that out.\n\n1790\n01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:50,270\nI've never tried it.\n\n1791\n01:33:50,270 --> 01:33:53,850\nIf you have a home and work setup,\nyou might not need an automatic one, so\n\n1792\n01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:55,180\nyou might wanna get rid of that.\n\n1793\n01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:56,500\nI'm not entirely sure if you can.\n\n1794\n01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,460\nLet's see if it'll let me do that.\n\n1795\n01:33:58,460 --> 01:33:59,240\nI take automatic.\n\n1796\n01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:03,070\nYeah, it actually will let you remove it,\nso now I just have home and work, and\n\n1797\n01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:07,340\nI might even add another one,\nfor Hotel or Travel, right?\n\n1798\n01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,900\nTravel or public.\n\n1799\n01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:12,810\nAnd on that one I might have\nVPN connections set up.\n\n1800\n01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:15,820\nI might not need a VPN connection at work,\nso don't bother showing that, but\n\n1801\n01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:18,160\nat travel, I might want that.\n\n1802\n01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:23,780\nIf I create a travel location, and then\nin here I can come in and add, and I can\n\n1803\n01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:28,490\nadd a VPN connection, and I'm adding that\nVPN connection just for travel, right?\n\n1804\n01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:31,790\nIt shows up right there and\nI've got that available, and\n\n1805\n01:34:31,790 --> 01:34:33,540\nnow that VPN is available for me.\n\n1806\n01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:37,420\nIf I switch back to my home and\nwork, see how VPN disappears?\n\n1807\n01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:39,200\nIt's not a part of those profiles.\n\n1808\n01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,900\nWhen I'm at home or\nwork I don't need the VPN.\n\n1809\n01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:44,230\nWhen I'm traveling I don't\ntrust that network, and so\n\n1810\n01:34:44,230 --> 01:34:46,870\nwhen I'm in my travel location,\nI've got the VPN and\n\n1811\n01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:52,520\nI probably need to modify my service order\nto get that up towards the top, right?\n\n1812\n01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,950\nI want my VPN to be preferred.\n\n1813\n01:34:54,950 --> 01:34:59,280\nWhen I communicate, if I communicate\nencrypted I want that to be the default.\n\n1814\n01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:04,840\nAll right a few of the things worth\nmentioning on wireless networks, that\n\n1815\n01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:08,549\npreshared key that I punched in that was\none way to connect to a wireless network.\n\n1816\n01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:13,720\nIt may be that your company\nuses a hidden SSID and\n\n1817\n01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:16,750\nthat's where the SSID is not being\nbroadcast out over the wireless.\n\n1818\n01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:21,180\nYou choose WiFi and you choose network\nname and it's not here in the list.\n\n1819\n01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:24,660\nIf it's not on the list, then it's\neither out of range or it's hidden.\n\n1820\n01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:28,010\nAnd if it's hidden,\nyou can just hit join other network.\n\n1821\n01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:30,060\nAnd now that you type in,\nthe network name.\n\n1822\n01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:32,030\nAnd that's what you'll\nhave to do if it's hidden.\n\n1823\n01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:35,830\nAnd then under security, you can choose\nwhat level of security it's using.\n\n1824\n01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:41,510\nNotice that WPA, WPA2,\nare listed as personal and Enterprise.\n\n1825\n01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:44,180\nPersonal, uses a pre-shared key.\n\n1826\n01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:47,100\nEnterprise, uses a certificate.\n\n1827\n01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,420\nRight.\nSo that's the difference between the two.\n\n1828\n01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:50,220\nWhen you choose Enterprise,\n\n1829\n01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:51,887\nthat means you're gonna be\nproviding it with a certificate.\n\n1830\n01:35:55,087 --> 01:35:55,926\nAll right.\n\n1831\n01:35:55,926 --> 01:35:58,578\nOther things to notice,\nif we go under Advanced,\n\n1832\n01:35:58,578 --> 01:36:01,879\ninside of here you'll see that 802.1x tab,\nall right.\n\n1833\n01:36:01,879 --> 01:36:05,923\nIf we have a certificate loaded for\nauthentication, it'll show up right here.\n\n1834\n01:36:05,923 --> 01:36:09,671\nUnder authentication, under 802.1s,\nyou'll see that right here.\n\n1835\n01:36:09,671 --> 01:36:12,680\nYour administrator will\nload that onto a computer.\n\n1836\n01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:15,890\nAnd that, if you stay for\nthe ACTC show we're gonna do,\n\n1837\n01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:17,790\nwe'll actually show that process in there.\n\n1838\n01:36:17,790 --> 01:36:21,090\nBut for most of us, the administrators\njust load it, it's set up, and\n\n1839\n01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:23,140\nit's done, it's right there.\n\n1840\n01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:26,260\nIf you've ever worked with\nApple Remote Desktop or\n\n1841\n01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:28,960\nthe profile manager on an OS X server,\n\n1842\n01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,630\nthey can push that certificate right out\nto these clients and get them setup.\n\n1843\n01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:34,400\nThe user doesn't have to load\nthe certificate, themselves.\n\n1844\n01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:34,900\nThat's pretty handy.\n\n1845\n01:36:36,513 --> 01:36:38,790\nAll right [COUGH] and\nthat applies to wired networks, too.\n\n1846\n01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:41,950\nYou can do 802.1X authentication\non a wired network.\n\n1847\n01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:43,500\nNot a lot of people do, but you can.\n\n1848\n01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,139\nIt gives you that extra level of security.\n\n1849\n01:36:46,677 --> 01:36:47,295\nAlright but\n\n1850\n01:36:47,295 --> 01:36:51,230\nother than that you're wireless\nnetworks are pretty much the same.\n\n1851\n01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:55,280\nThe only other thing is that we do have\nwireless network priorities over here.\n\n1852\n01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:00,940\nYou'll see that I prefer this Pizet\nprivate network or the Pizets or whatever.\n\n1853\n01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:04,710\nEach of these different networks\nare listed and I can prioritize those.\n\n1854\n01:37:04,710 --> 01:37:09,440\nI can drag them and drop them, if I'm ever\nin range of two networks at the same time.\n\n1855\n01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,710\nWhich one do I prefer?\n\n1856\n01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:12,490\nSo I can drag those and readjust them.\n\n1857\n01:37:12,490 --> 01:37:15,690\nSo we've got a few options there, right.\n\n1858\n01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:17,260\nTwo last little comments I'll wanna make.\n\n1859\n01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:21,120\nThere's some functions that are disabled\nin Yosemite that might be enabled\n\n1860\n01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,790\nin other versions that can\nbe a little confusing.\n\n1861\n01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:27,360\nNotice I've got down here create\ncomputer to computer networks.\n\n1862\n01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,030\nAnd that's turned off, right.\n\n1863\n01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:29,530\nIt says,\n\n1864\n01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:34,120\nrequire administrator authorization to\ncreate computer-to-computer networks.\n\n1865\n01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:36,910\nYou can create what's\ncalled an Ad Hoc network,\n\n1866\n01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:40,200\na wireless network that doesn't\nrely on an access point.\n\n1867\n01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:43,030\nIf you have two laptops and you just wanna\nshare some information between them really\n\n1868\n01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:46,720\nquick, you can create an Ad Hoc\nwireless network and share that data.\n\n1869\n01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:51,420\nWhen we click on our wireless menu up top,\nyou'll see all the wireless networks that\n\n1870\n01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:54,100\nI have out there and\nI can choose create a network.\n\n1871\n01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:58,030\nAnd when you choose create,\nthat's gonna build an Ad Hoc network.\n\n1872\n01:37:58,030 --> 01:38:00,360\nYou give it a name and\nthen someone else can connect to it.\n\n1873\n01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:04,300\nYou may not want your end\nusers to be able to do that.\n\n1874\n01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:07,350\nAnd if you don't want them to do it,\nyou choose this option right here.\n\n1875\n01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:10,510\nYou've gotta be an administrator\nto create those Ad Hoc networks.\n\n1876\n01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:14,470\nThe default cuz it's off and that means\nyour end users can create those Ad Hoc\n\n1877\n01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:18,810\nnetworks and that could put your data at\nrisk if they don't properly secure those.\n\n1878\n01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:20,217\nThat can be dangerous.\n\n1879\n01:38:20,217 --> 01:38:24,033\nAnother thing that's actually\nmore secure than it used to be,\n\n1880\n01:38:24,033 --> 01:38:26,570\nin previous versions of Mac OS.\n\n1881\n01:38:26,570 --> 01:38:31,150\nIf it fired up, and there were no\nknown wireless networks, right.\n\n1882\n01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:32,710\nSo these are all my known networks,\n\n1883\n01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:34,550\nthese are networks that\nI've connected to before.\n\n1884\n01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:35,630\nI know they're out there.\n\n1885\n01:38:35,630 --> 01:38:37,620\nIf I see one of these,\nI'm gonna connect to them.\n\n1886\n01:38:38,650 --> 01:38:42,630\nBut if I can't find any of those in\nprevious versions of Mac OS it would look\n\n1887\n01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:44,150\nfor any unsecure network.\n\n1888\n01:38:44,150 --> 01:38:47,700\nIt would basically look for\nany network that was out there.\n\n1889\n01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:49,770\nThat didn't have a lock on it, right.\n\n1890\n01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:54,310\nAny network that was just open, then\nit would automatically connect to that.\n\n1891\n01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:57,090\nNow, do you want to automatically\nconnect to a non-secure network?\n\n1892\n01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:58,290\nI know I don't.\n\n1893\n01:38:58,290 --> 01:39:01,440\nSo, that's an unfortunate\nbehavior in previous versions.\n\n1894\n01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,440\nIn Yosemite that doesn't happen.\n\n1895\n01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:06,810\nIn Yosemite it will not connect to an\nunsecured network unless you tell it to.\n\n1896\n01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:09,870\nYou have to come in and\nchoose it yourself, all right.\n\n1897\n01:39:09,870 --> 01:39:14,510\nAnd that option Is actually controlled\nby this little value right here.\n\n1898\n01:39:14,510 --> 01:39:17,550\nSee where it says,\nask to join new networks?\n\n1899\n01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:21,840\nIf you turn that on, when it goes\nto connect to a new network, right,\n\n1900\n01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,370\none of these unknown, unsecure networks,\nit will ask you first.\n\n1901\n01:39:25,370 --> 01:39:28,730\nIt'll say, hey I don't see any\nknown networks that are out there.\n\n1902\n01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:32,150\nHere's this unsecure one,\nwould you like to connect to it?\n\n1903\n01:39:32,150 --> 01:39:33,430\nAnd then it'll connect.\n\n1904\n01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:33,940\nRight.\n\n1905\n01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:37,370\nIf you turn that off, it won't do it.\n\n1906\n01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:41,880\nIt won't ask, and see how it says you\nwill have to manually select the network.\n\n1907\n01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,210\nTurning that off says,\n\n1908\n01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:46,430\ndon't even ask me to connect to\none of these unsecure networks.\n\n1909\n01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:48,170\nMake me have to manually choose it.\n\n1910\n01:39:48,170 --> 01:39:49,510\nAnd that's the default, right.\n\n1911\n01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:51,630\nIt's turned off by default.\n\n1912\n01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:53,610\nYou'll have to manually connect\nto those unsecure networks.\n\n1913\n01:39:53,610 --> 01:39:56,410\nThat is different than\nprevious versions of Mac OS.\n\n1914\n01:39:56,410 --> 01:39:59,335\nSo be aware that on the exam, you might\nhave seen it one way over the years, and\n\n1915\n01:39:59,335 --> 01:40:00,642\nnow it's a little bit different.\n\n1916\n01:40:01,936 --> 01:40:03,140\nAll right.\n\n1917\n01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:06,820\nSo those are all some of the different\nvariations when it comes to networking.\n\n1918\n01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:08,150\nThere's a lot of neat stuff in there.\n\n1919\n01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:12,703\nMac OS gives us a lot of tools, and\nthey're all really incredibly easy and\n\n1920\n01:40:12,703 --> 01:40:13,442\npowerful.\n\n1921\n01:40:14,454 --> 01:40:17,510\nAll right, well, that's about it for\nmy topics today.\n\n1922\n01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:19,390\nSo let's kind of recap what we went over.\n\n1923\n01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:23,660\nRight, in the very beginning, we started\ntalking about IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,\n\n1924\n01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:25,610\nhow they're built up and how they work.\n\n1925\n01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:28,500\nWe talked a little bit about how\nnetworking functions in general,\n\n1926\n01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:31,100\nlike our broadcast and\nARP messages that go on,\n\n1927\n01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:35,270\nDHCP, lot of network infrastructure\nthose first two segments.\n\n1928\n01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:37,250\nIf you wanna learn more about those,\n\n1929\n01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:39,890\nI really do encourage you to jump\nover to that Network Plus show.\n\n1930\n01:40:39,890 --> 01:40:42,750\nWe go in depth on a lot of\nthat stuff in there, and\n\n1931\n01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:44,080\nyou can learn a ton of information.\n\n1932\n01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:47,000\nWe cover what was on the exam,\nbut you know,\n\n1933\n01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,590\nthere's always good information to\nlearn for out there in real life.\n\n1934\n01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:53,470\nAnd then for the second half of the show\nwe covered configurations, right.\n\n1935\n01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:56,030\nConfiguring our wired adapters,\nour wireless adapters,\n\n1936\n01:40:56,030 --> 01:41:00,650\nwe saw setting priorities,\nwe saw DACP and manual IP assignments\n\n1937\n01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:04,850\nas well as changing the order,\nthe preference of those adapters.\n\n1938\n01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:08,060\nWe had a TSC troubleshooting,\nwe used the network utility and\n\n1939\n01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:11,270\nsaw some network problems now we\ncan identify and diagnose those.\n\n1940\n01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:14,280\nAnd move on to a properly\nfunctioning network.\n\n1941\n01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:18,010\nSo a lot of neat stuff in there,\nall definitely good stuff.\n\n1942\n01:41:18,010 --> 01:41:20,200\nNow I recognize some of\nthis is pretty complex,\n\n1943\n01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:24,330\nso always remember if you have\nquestions on it, feel free to ask.\n\n1944\n01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:26,515\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live and\n\n1945\n01:41:26,515 --> 01:41:29,385\nyou'll see the chat box beneath the video.\n\n1946\n01:41:29,385 --> 01:41:30,395\nPost your questions there.\n\n1947\n01:41:30,395 --> 01:41:31,995\nWe monitor and answer during the show.\n\n1948\n01:41:31,995 --> 01:41:35,615\nIf you have questions after the show,\nuse our Q&A forums.\n\n1949\n01:41:35,615 --> 01:41:39,345\nAt the top of every page in ITProTV,\nyou'll see a link that says Q&A.\n\n1950\n01:41:39,345 --> 01:41:40,280\nClick on it.\n\n1951\n01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:41,980\nOnce you click on that it'll\ntake you to our forums.\n\n1952\n01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:43,440\nYou can post your questions there.\n\n1953\n01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:44,932\nWe monitor and answer after the show.\n\n1954\n01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:47,720\nWe wanna make sure you guys get\nthe answers to your questions so\n\n1955\n01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,030\nthat when you go into that testing booth,\n\n1956\n01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:51,700\nyou're going in there with answers in\nyour mind, and not questions, right.\n\n1957\n01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:52,277\nThat's not gonna help you much.\n\n1958\n01:41:52,277 --> 01:41:54,850\nAll right,\ntake advantage of that resource.\n\n1959\n01:41:54,850 --> 01:41:56,930\nIt is there for you.\n\n1960\n01:41:56,930 --> 01:41:58,790\nWell, I hope you guys\nenjoyed today's show.\n\n1961\n01:41:58,790 --> 01:42:00,140\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n1962\n01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:01,907\nAnd I'll see you next time.\n\n1963\n01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:11,907\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:38,921\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:41,902\nI'm your host Don Pezet back\nagain with another episode\n\n5\n00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:44,255\nof Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n6\n00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:47,400\nWe're gonna be diving back in to\nthe world of networking in this episode.\n\n7\n00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,760\nI know if you're watching\nall these in order,\n\n8\n00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,700\nour last episode was on\nnetwork configuration.\n\n9\n00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,430\nBut now we're gonna take\na look at network services.\n\n10\n00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,080\nAnd what do I mean by network services?\n\n11\n00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,840\nWell, once you've got network\nconnectivity, once you're plugged in or\n\n12\n00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,540\nconnected via wireless or whatever,\nwhat do you do with your network?\n\n13\n00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,300\nIt's there, how do you use it?\n\n14\n00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,400\nWell, network services are the things\nthat we can use across that network.\n\n15\n00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,770\nAnd network services used to be\nreally basic, it used to be file and\n\n16\n00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,390\nprinter sharing and that was it.\n\n17\n00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,470\nI could share files,\n\n18\n00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,710\nI could share printers between\nmy machines and that was it.\n\n19\n00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,540\nAnd then in came the Internet.\n\n20\n00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,480\nAnd we started having these\nlike Web browsers, right?\n\n21\n00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,960\nSo we could get to Web pages and\nFTP servers for file transfer.\n\n22\n00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,030\nAnd now, now it's just gone crazy, right?\n\n23\n00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,010\nWe have all sorts of crazy services\nthat are available out there.\n\n24\n00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,060\nAnd they're not crazy.\n\n25\n00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,160\nThey're all useful.\n\n26\n00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,450\nIt's just so diverse.\n\n27\n00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,680\nWe use the network for so\n\n28\n00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,200\nmany different things now that we never\neven thought of years and years ago.\n\n29\n00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,160\nThat it's really pretty amazing.\n\n30\n00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,030\nSo as a result, we end up having an entire\nshow like this one where we focus on\n\n31\n00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,380\nthe various things that we\ncan use the network for.\n\n32\n00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,760\nAnd how we can do a basic figuration for\nthem, all right?\n\n33\n00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,930\nNow, the first one that I'm gonna cover,\nis probably the most important one.\n\n34\n00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,040\nIt's the one that Apple's\nthe most proud of.\n\n35\n00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,503\nIt's iCloud.\n\n36\n00:01:58,503 --> 00:02:01,970\nOne of the big challenges you have\nwith network services is getting them\n\n37\n00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,800\nconfigured properly.\n\n38\n00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,920\nWhen you have a network service,\n\n39\n00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,900\nit's typically what's called\na client server model.\n\n40\n00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,420\nThat means that there's a server somewhere\nthat's actually running the service.\n\n41\n00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,000\nAnd then you've got all your\nvarious clients that connect to it.\n\n42\n00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,211\nSo for example if I'm doing file sharing,\nthere's a server somewhere.\n\n43\n00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:20,340\nAnd by server,\nthat might be a workstation.\n\n44\n00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,253\nIt doesn't have to be some\nhardcore piece of machinery.\n\n45\n00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:25,170\nIt could just be a laptop.\n\n46\n00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,130\nIt's serving up a shared folder.\n\n47\n00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,709\nAnd all the clients on the network\nscan and find that shared folder and\n\n48\n00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:31,295\nconnect to it.\n\n49\n00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:32,815\nThey're clients, they depend on it, right?\n\n50\n00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:34,830\nClient-server model.\n\n51\n00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,350\nSo, that's normally what we have.\n\n52\n00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,020\nBut there are some services that\nare what are called peer-to-peer.\n\n53\n00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,300\nWhere the clients just\nconnect to each other,\n\n54\n00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,250\nand neither one of them is the server.\n\n55\n00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,240\nNo one client acts as that server role,\n\n56\n00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,500\neveryone works together in kinda\nlike a communist environment, right?\n\n57\n00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,694\nIt's all everybody's treated equally,\nright?\n\n58\n00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:55,142\nWell, either model, client-server or\n\n59\n00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:59,220\nclient-to-client, the biggest challenge\nis getting this set up, right?\n\n60\n00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,900\nAnd if we're dealing with networks and\nfirewalls and\n\n61\n00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,430\nrouters and all the different\nthings that go in between our PCs,\n\n62\n00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,160\nwell we might end up in an environment\nwhere we can't communicate, and\n\n63\n00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,800\nthen we gotta troubleshoot it and\nfigure it out.\n\n64\n00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,730\nAnd so what Apple did is they stepped\nin and said well, what if we do this?\n\n65\n00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,350\nWhat if we provide the service?\n\n66\n00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,400\nWhat if Apple provides that service\nout on the Internet in the cloud?\n\n67\n00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,060\nAnd then you don't have to worry about\nsetting it up and crazy configurations.\n\n68\n00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,753\nYou just connect up to our cloud.\n\n69\n00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:29,420\nAnd it won't matter if you're at home or\nat work or traveling.\n\n70\n00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,140\nYou'll always be able to connect to\nthat cloud service and have access.\n\n71\n00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,176\nAnd if you lose your laptop or\nyour hard drive fails, well,\n\n72\n00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:37,628\nall your data was up there in the cloud,\nright?\n\n73\n00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:39,480\nCentralized communications.\n\n74\n00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,540\nNow iCloud has grown a lot\nover the last few years.\n\n75\n00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,260\nAnd they've expanded the services on it.\n\n76\n00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,350\nSo let's go over some of the services\nthat are supported inside of Yosemite.\n\n77\n00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,700\nAssuming that we connect to iCloud, right?\n\n78\n00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,440\nSo I've got a workstation\nhere running Yosemite.\n\n79\n00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,340\nAnd I'm just gonna jump\ninto my System Preferences.\n\n80\n00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,600\nAnd we have a dedicated\niCloud system preference.\n\n81\n00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,740\nIt used to be tucked away\nunder Internet Accounts, but\n\n82\n00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,880\nnow it's got own dedicated thing.\n\n83\n00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,960\nAnd I'm just gonna just jump right\ninto that iCloud preference.\n\n84\n00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,950\nNow, if I haven't signed in with an Apple\nID, it's gonna prompt me at this point.\n\n85\n00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,880\nIf you don't have one\nyou'll need to create one.\n\n86\n00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,170\nBecause we're connecting to Apple's\nservers, we've gotta authenticate.\n\n87\n00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,390\nThere's millions of users that\nare on these servers also.\n\n88\n00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,650\nYou wanna keep your data separate and\nsafe.\n\n89\n00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,110\nSo you gotta pick an account.\n\n90\n00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,530\nIf you don't have one you can\nchoose create an Apple ID.\n\n91\n00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,300\nIt's free.\nYou create an account and off you go.\n\n92\n00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,120\nIf you already have one though, you can\njust punch that information in here and\n\n93\n00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,630\nget logged in.\n\n94\n00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,150\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nget logged into that service.\n\n95\n00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,460\nAnd as soon as I'm in then\nI'll be able to customize it.\n\n96\n00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,260\nNow when you first connect to iCloud,\nif you haven't\n\n97\n00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,045\nset it up before you might see an end user\nlicense agreement, a few other things.\n\n98\n00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:49,005\nIt's actually asking me if I\nwanna configure some of the basic\n\n99\n00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:50,477\nservices right here.\n\n100\n00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:52,325\nAll right, I'll go ahead and\njust go with the default.\n\n101\n00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:56,425\nAnd you see how it says use iCloud for\ncontacts, calendars, reminders, and\n\n102\n00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:59,205\nSafari, and use Find My Mac.\n\n103\n00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:02,680\nWell, those are a few basic\nservices that are a part of iCloud.\n\n104\n00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,990\nMost of them are self-explanatory.\n\n105\n00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,860\nContacts.\n\n106\n00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,420\nWell down here in Yosemite,\nI've got a Contacts application, and\n\n107\n00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,630\ninside of it will be all the people that\nI communicate with, email addresses,\n\n108\n00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,400\nphone numbers, and so on.\n\n109\n00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,960\nBy default that's stored in\nyour user profile on your Mac.\n\n110\n00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,320\nAnd if you have two or\nthree Macs, you've got two or\n\n111\n00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,300\nthree separate sets of contacts.\n\n112\n00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,190\nBut if we use iCloud for\nit, our contacts will\n\n113\n00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,700\nsynchronize across all the machines that\nare logged in with our iCloud account.\n\n114\n00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,270\nSo now we just have one contact database.\n\n115\n00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,040\nAnd if we don't have access to our\ncomputer, we can always go to iCloud's\n\n116\n00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,090\nwebsite, www.icloud.com, log in,\nand add access to those contacts.\n\n117\n00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,920\nThe same thing goes for\ncalendars and reminders, right?\n\n118\n00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,750\nThe calendar items that we set.\n\n119\n00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,398\nAnd Safari, for our bookmarks,\nso if I have a bunch\n\n120\n00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:49,342\nof really cool bookmarks on my desktop,\nthey synchronize to my laptop, and\n\n121\n00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:52,503\neven to our mobile devices,\nour iPhones and iPads, right.\n\n122\n00:05:52,503 --> 00:05:55,130\nSo, it synchronizes across all of that,\nwhich is pretty slick stuff.\n\n123\n00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,090\nAnd then Find My Mac.\n\n124\n00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,260\nThis is one that's really useful.\n\n125\n00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,900\nHave you ever lost your cell phone or\nlost your iPad?\n\n126\n00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,070\nCan't remember where your laptop is?\n\n127\n00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,120\nIt just happened to me the other day.\n\n128\n00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,850\nThe other day I was at home and\nmy son said can I use your iPad, Dad?\n\n129\n00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,850\nAnd I said oh, sure, and\nhe asked where it was.\n\n130\n00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,630\nI said well I don't remember.\n\n131\n00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,970\nI don't remember where it is.\n\n132\n00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,980\nIt might be in the car,\nit might be in my bedroom.\n\n133\n00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,205\nAnd so I went on my laptop,\nfired it up, connected into iCloud,\n\n134\n00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:23,220\nand I did Find My Mac.\n\n135\n00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,290\nAnd I went to look to\nfind out where it was.\n\n136\n00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,520\nActually I think I pulled it up on\nmy cellphone if I remember, right?\n\n137\n00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,650\nSo I was on my iPhone and\nI went to Find My Mac.\n\n138\n00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,530\nAnd I pulled my iPad up on there, and\nit showed it right here at the office.\n\n139\n00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,472\nAnd so I knew it was at the office and I\ndidn't have to worry about it being stolen\n\n140\n00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:40,253\nand off in the middle of nowhere,\nI can see it was right here at the office.\n\n141\n00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:42,290\nAnd that's really cool stuff.\n\n142\n00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,461\nIt is somewhat limited in Yosemite though.\n\n143\n00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:48,265\nAnd one of the basic functions\nyou have to have in order for\n\n144\n00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:50,440\nthis to work is a GPS location.\n\n145\n00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,450\nIf you don't have a GPS\nlocation it's not gonna work.\n\n146\n00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,370\nSo if you have an older Mac with\nno GPS service or if you're not\n\n147\n00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,020\nconnected to any wireless network,\nit's not gonna work very well, is it?\n\n148\n00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,016\nOn an iPhone or iPad you've got GPS,\nyou've got location and wireless services,\n\n149\n00:07:03,016 --> 00:07:04,170\nyou know you have that.\n\n150\n00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,510\nSo really incredibly useful there.\n\n151\n00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,878\nOn a desktop you don't\nnormally have GPS service.\n\n152\n00:07:08,878 --> 00:07:12,336\nYou don't normally use wireless, and\nso those it's harder for it to locate.\n\n153\n00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:14,628\nOn a laptop though if you have\na newer Mac, then it will.\n\n154\n00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:16,740\nAnd you'll be able to\nfind them pretty easy.\n\n155\n00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,461\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nturn those options on.\n\n156\n00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:21,400\nNow be careful with this option here,\nFind My Mac.\n\n157\n00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,850\nIf you have more than one\nuser account on the laptop,\n\n158\n00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:30,810\nFind My Mac can only tie\na Mac to one iCloud account.\n\n159\n00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,560\nSo if I have five users\nwith five iCloud accounts,\n\n160\n00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,460\nI can only Find My Mac to one of them,\nall right?\n\n161\n00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,100\nSo you need to pick like an administrator\naccount, or some centralized account.\n\n162\n00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,700\nAnd if one of those five users loses\nthe device they can't look it up.\n\n163\n00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,070\nThey have to come to the administrator and\nsay hey can you look it up and\n\n164\n00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,555\nsee where my device is and\nthey'll find it.\n\n165\n00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:49,679\nJust be aware of that.\n\n166\n00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:50,850\nIf you don't share your laptop.\n\n167\n00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,910\nI don't share my laptop.\n\n168\n00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,741\nI'm the only that uses it so I just tie\nit to my iCloud account and that's that.\n\n169\n00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,987\nBut if you do share it,\nlike a family device,\n\n170\n00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:00,248\nyou'll have to pick one\naccount to tie it to.\n\n171\n00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:02,895\nAll right, I'll go ahead and\nhit Next on that.\n\n172\n00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:07,040\nAnd it's gonna turn on iCloud for\nmy device and get it connected.\n\n173\n00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,170\nNow when it gets setup,\n\n174\n00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,350\nit's asked me to punch in my Apple ID\npassword to set up my iCloud Keychain.\n\n175\n00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,950\nWe have a keychain on our computer\nnormally that's storing our\n\n176\n00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,510\nuser credentials for our local access.\n\n177\n00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,710\niCloud has a keychain also.\n\n178\n00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,600\nAnd we can synchronize our local\ncredentials with the iCloud credentials so\n\n179\n00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,120\nthat it will then synchronize\nacross all of our computers.\n\n180\n00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,390\nYou may or\nmay not want that functionality but\n\n181\n00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,620\nif you're gonna use Find My Mac\nyou're gonna need it.\n\n182\n00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,780\nSo I need to punch in my password\nhere again so it'll have that.\n\n183\n00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,480\nAnd store it in the keychain so\n\n184\n00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,120\nthat it'll be able to access\nthis service automatically.\n\n185\n00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,100\nBasically when the computer turns on,\nit needs to be able to reach out and\n\n186\n00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,980\nreport location information,\neven before I log in.\n\n187\n00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,820\nSo my keychain might be locked\nbecause I'm not logged in yet.\n\n188\n00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,990\nIt still needs to be able\nto reach out to do it.\n\n189\n00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,550\nIf I don't do that,\nif I don't give it the ability to do that,\n\n190\n00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,970\nwhat's gonna happen is,\nmy computer's gonna turn on.\n\n191\n00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,770\nAnd if I don't login,\nit's not gonna report data.\n\n192\n00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,610\nIt's not gonna report whether\nthe system is at my office, or\n\n193\n00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,840\nbeing sold on eBay right now.\n\n194\n00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,747\nI won't know that because it\ncan't report back in, right.\n\n195\n00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,720\nNow when you set this up, you do need\nto set up a PIN number for iCloud.\n\n196\n00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,230\nSo I'll have to punch in some kind of\nPIN number to use for that system so\n\n197\n00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,320\nI will punch one in.\n\n198\n00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,908\nBy default it's a four-digit\nnumeric security code.\n\n199\n00:09:25,908 --> 00:09:27,940\nIf you wanna go more advanced\nyou can hit Advance and\n\n200\n00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,280\nyou can put in a bigger PIN number or\neven letters.\n\n201\n00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,680\nYou can do all sorts\nof crazy things there.\n\n202\n00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,945\nAnd I just have to verify it and\nmake sure I got it right.\n\n203\n00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:38,215\nAll right, and then it's asking for\n\n204\n00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:41,095\na phone number that can\nreceive text messages.\n\n205\n00:09:41,095 --> 00:09:44,165\nIf I ever lose this device or\nneed to do verification for iCloud,\n\n206\n00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:46,115\nit can send me a text message with a code.\n\n207\n00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:49,575\nThis is like a second factor, or\na dual factor authentication.\n\n208\n00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:52,720\nIf somebody tries to log in with\niCloud on another computer,\n\n209\n00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,888\nthey'll need my username and password.\n\n210\n00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:58,403\nAnd the verification code that\ngets sent to me via text, so\n\n211\n00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:01,367\nwe'd need both pieces of information,\nright?\n\n212\n00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,820\nI'll just put in my office number here.\n\n213\n00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,800\nLet's see if I can punch that in.\n\n214\n00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,300\nThere we go.\n\n215\n00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,940\nWe'll get that on, and now it's enabled.\n\n216\n00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,920\nNow iCloud is turned on, and I can see\nContacts, Calendars, Reminders and Safari,\n\n217\n00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,410\njust like in that menu.\n\n218\n00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,900\nThose were each of those options.\n\n219\n00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,140\nAnd down at the bottom\nI've got Find My Mac.\n\n220\n00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,730\nThe only one that wasn't on that\ndefault screen was Keychain, but\n\n221\n00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,000\nwe saw those options, right?\n\n222\n00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,780\nSo Keychain synchronization is on.\n\n223\n00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,390\nI could turn that off, but\n\n224\n00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,230\njust be aware that your laptop won't\nsynchronize until after you log in.\n\n225\n00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,590\nIf the keychain access is turned off.\n\n226\n00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,090\nSome of the other things we can turn on,\nnotes.\n\n227\n00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,970\nI can synchronize the notes\nthat I generate right down here\n\n228\n00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,020\nwith the Notes app.\n\n229\n00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,560\nAnd those will synchronize up to iCloud\nand across my different devices.\n\n230\n00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,733\nI might wanna turn that on.\n\n231\n00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,650\nI'll go ahead and check it off.\n\n232\n00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,590\nAnd with Notes,\nthe reason it didn't turn it on by default\n\n233\n00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,960\nis they want you to have\nan iCloud email address.\n\n234\n00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,930\nSo here it's asking me to\npick an iCloud email address.\n\n235\n00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,330\nAnd I'll just call this one maybe.\n\n236\n00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,354\nLet's see if it will let\nme do a .lab.itprotv.\n\n237\n00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:06,670\nI'm not sure if it will let\nme do a period in the name.\n\n238\n00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,450\nApparently it will.\n\n239\n00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,170\nGood, well, there we go.\n\n240\n00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,374\nSo now I got an iCloud address.\n\n241\n00:11:09,374 --> 00:11:11,834\nThat will be awesome.\n\n242\n00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:15,200\n[LAUGH] So now it's got that and we'll\nbe able to synchronize those notes up.\n\n243\n00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,740\nSo notes that I generate on my laptop\nwill now synchronize with the iCloud and\n\n244\n00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,000\nif I have other devices that are running\nNotes it'll bring that back down and\n\n245\n00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,567\nit'll be available, right?\n\n246\n00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,915\nIt's also asking if I wanna add\nother things, iMessage and FaceTime.\n\n247\n00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:31,275\niMessage, that'll let me\nsend text messages back and\n\n248\n00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:33,685\nforth between my computer and\nother systems that are out there.\n\n249\n00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:38,705\nAnd FaceTime, I can make video and voice\nphone calls, as well as receive them.\n\n250\n00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:42,801\nWhen Yosemite came out, one of the big\nfeatures they promoted was Unity, right?\n\n251\n00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:47,630\nUnity, where if your cell phone rings,\nyour computer rings, your laptop rings,\n\n252\n00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,180\nyour desktop rings, your iPad rings.\n\n253\n00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,590\nAnd you can answer your\nphone on any of those.\n\n254\n00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,510\nAnd if I want to send a text message\nto somebody I can do it from my phone,\n\n255\n00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,750\nfrom my iPad, from my desktop,\nfrom my Yosemite machine, right?\n\n256\n00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,730\nThat's Unity.\n\n257\n00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,610\nWell, FaceTime is what drives all of that,\nright?\n\n258\n00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,250\nIt's FaceTime that's\nmaking the phone calls,\n\n259\n00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,590\nthat's doing the text messaging,\nwell coupled with messages.\n\n260\n00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,380\nAnd Messages used to be iMessage.\n\n261\n00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,730\nNow it's just Messages.\n\n262\n00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,450\nSo it's those two combined that\nare really providing that.\n\n263\n00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,620\nSo it's offering to turn those on,\nwhich is effectively gonna turn on Unity.\n\n264\n00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,360\nNow I normally keep Unity turned off on\nmy laptop because I don't want a bunch of\n\n265\n00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,780\nnotifications coming up during the show,\nthat's my main reason for doing that.\n\n266\n00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,420\nBut, if you're not on a show like I am,\nthen Unity is actually a pretty neat\n\n267\n00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,490\nfeature and it's pretty valuable,\na useful thing to have.\n\n268\n00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,220\nI'm gonna say Yes to go ahead and\nturn that on.\n\n269\n00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,880\nAnd now I'll see the majority of my\nservices have a nice little check mark\n\n270\n00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,530\nbeside them, okay?\n\n271\n00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,350\nThe other ones that are left\nare kind of optional ones.\n\n272\n00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,553\nI've got photos, right?\n\n273\n00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,358\nIf I take pictures on my iPad,\n\n274\n00:12:44,358 --> 00:12:48,600\nwouldn't it be nice if they\nsynchronized down to my desktop?\n\n275\n00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,800\nOr even if I just have a laptop,\nif I take any pictures here,\n\n276\n00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,180\nI want them to synchronize to iCloud so if\nI lose my laptop, I still have my photos.\n\n277\n00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,560\nSo I can check that off\ntoo to back that up.\n\n278\n00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,620\nNow, notice it's kinda grayed out on mine.\n\n279\n00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,216\nIt tells me I need to update iPhoto or\nAperture, right?\n\n280\n00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:09,080\nWell, I installed Yosemite on here and\nI haven't done any of the updates.\n\n281\n00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,130\nThere is an update for iPhoto that\nenables iCloud synchronization.\n\n282\n00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,220\nBut the one that comes with Yosemite\nstock doesn't support it so\n\n283\n00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,080\nI can't turn that on\nuntil I update iPhoto.\n\n284\n00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,006\nAnd it's mentioning Aperture depending\non when you watch this show,\n\n285\n00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:24,800\nAperture might not be available anymore.\n\n286\n00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,960\nApple's working on replacing that\nin the next two to three months, so\n\n287\n00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,700\nAperture might go away, but\nif you have Aperture, same thing.\n\n288\n00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,800\nYou've got to update it before it\ncan support uploading to iCloud.\n\n289\n00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:36,305\nAfter that I've got mail.\n\n290\n00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:40,755\nIf I'm using the Mac mail client, then\nI can synchronize my email account and\n\n291\n00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:43,285\nother informations up into iCloud too.\n\n292\n00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:46,125\nThat makes it pretty useful if you're\nrunning the mail client on more than one\n\n293\n00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,883\nmachine, you'll be able\nto access that data too.\n\n294\n00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:50,875\nI don't wanna set up an email account\nright now so I won't bother with that one.\n\n295\n00:13:53,797 --> 00:13:58,650\nOne really nice feature, one that I enjoy\nis this guy right here, Back to My Mac.\n\n296\n00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,790\nBack to My Mac is a remote\nscreen sharing option.\n\n297\n00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,630\nI have a desktop at home and\nI have my laptop right here and\n\n298\n00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,540\nsometimes I leave my laptop at work.\n\n299\n00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,720\nAnd when I'm at home I might wanna\naccess something on my laptop.\n\n300\n00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,380\nI might wanna access a file or\nfolder that's on it, or\n\n301\n00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,140\nI might wanna see the screen on my laptop,\nso I can work as if I was sitting there.\n\n302\n00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,720\nBack to My Mac lets you do that.\n\n303\n00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,710\nYou can go to any Mac that's logged\nin with your iCloud account, and\n\n304\n00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:31,550\nyou'll be able to see remote machines to\nbe able to go in and manage their screens.\n\n305\n00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,853\nNow, that's turned off by default because\na lot of people don't want remote access\n\n306\n00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:37,314\nto their computer, right?\n\n307\n00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:39,150\nSo it's turned off.\n\n308\n00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,370\nBut if we want it, we can turn it on,\n\n309\n00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,700\nand I'll just put on\na little check mark there.\n\n310\n00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:48,345\nNow, it gives me a little message right\nhere turn on sharing to access this mac,\n\n311\n00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,220\nright?\n\n312\n00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,060\nIt's not going to be able to share\nthe screen until I turn on that option.\n\n313\n00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,300\nAnd I'll show you guys\nthose options in a moment.\n\n314\n00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,250\nWe have screen sharing on the Mac\nalready for local machines.\n\n315\n00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,580\nWhat Back to My Mac is doing\nis enabling remote machines.\n\n316\n00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,820\nIf I turn on screen sharing by default\nother computers on the same network\n\n317\n00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,320\nwill be able to see my screen.\n\n318\n00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,910\nBut when I turn on Back to My Mac\nthis could be people remote,\n\n319\n00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,212\ncompletely different networks,\nto be able to see that screen.\n\n320\n00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:16,750\nAll right, so it's just kinda letting me\nknow that I'll need to take care of that.\n\n321\n00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,920\nIt's all just the same set up router for\nbetter performance.\n\n322\n00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,102\nThere's a couple of little notes that\nwe're getting kinda warned about.\n\n323\n00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:26,100\nAll right, one of the cool\nthings about Back to My Mac,\n\n324\n00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,310\nit does use a lot of various\nports on the network.\n\n325\n00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,080\nSo it uses TCP/IP to communicate,\nand it uses a number of TCP and\n\n326\n00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,120\nUDP ports to communicate.\n\n327\n00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,450\nWell, Apple has configured this for what's\ncalled Universal Plug and Play, UPNP.\n\n328\n00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,880\nIf your router or\nfirewall supports UPNP, for\n\n329\n00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,855\nexample if you have an Airport,\nthe Airports, those stations,\n\n330\n00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:52,410\nthey actually support UPNP, and they'll\nautomatically configure themselves.\n\n331\n00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,481\nThey'll automatically allow that Back\nto My Mac track to flow through it.\n\n332\n00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:59,917\nIf you don't have a router or firewall\nthat supports UPNP, you're gonna have to\n\n333\n00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:04,567\nmanually open up some firewall ports or do\nport forwarding on the device to allow it.\n\n334\n00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:08,097\nAnd they have this details button, you\ncan go in and it will show you Additional\n\n335\n00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:12,059\ninformation, and see here, it's kind of\nwarning me, that I've got problems because\n\n336\n00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:15,660\nMacport Mapping, or universal plug and\nplay is turned off on my router.\n\n337\n00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,150\nIt's telling me, it wasn't able to\nautomatically configure my router.\n\n338\n00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,430\nWe have a firewall that\ndoesn't allow that.\n\n339\n00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,860\nI have to go in and configure it myself.\n\n340\n00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,170\nNow configuring it yourself,\nis outside of the scope of the exam.\n\n341\n00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:33,060\nBut just in case you bump into it in\nreal life land, in the show notes for\n\n342\n00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,460\nthis episode,\nlet me bring up my show notes here.\n\n343\n00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,020\nIn the show notes for this episode,\n\n344\n00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,670\nI actually put a link in here for\nports used by Back to my Mac.\n\n345\n00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,310\nAnd I just made a little table,\n\n346\n00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:48,250\ndown here that has a list of all\nthe different ports and what they do.\n\n347\n00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:48,920\nAll right?\n\n348\n00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,990\nIf you've got to configure\nyour firewall or router.\n\n349\n00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,040\nThese are the ports that you\nhave to forward to allow\n\n350\n00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,680\nInternet connections coming\nin to access your Mac.\n\n351\n00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,050\nAnd it's quite a few ports,\nto be honest with you,\n\n352\n00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,190\nit's more than I generally like to\nopen up for outside access coming in.\n\n353\n00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,940\nYour Mac is It's pretty secure; it's\nable to handle the stuff just fine, but\n\n354\n00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,780\nI always like to go\nbetter safe than sorry.\n\n355\n00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,180\nThat's where we are relying on UPMP,\n\n356\n00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:17,610\nwhich is a little more just in time;\nit opens the ports when it needs them.\n\n357\n00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,610\nIt's a little bit more secure and\nreliable than doing it manually.\n\n358\n00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,220\nBut, I put that in there just in case\nyou guys ever have to deal with that.\n\n359\n00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,063\nYou'll see that in the show\nnotes with this episode.\n\n360\n00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:30,580\nSo I've got it turned on.\n\n361\n00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,240\nI'm not gonna worry about\nthe rest of it here.\n\n362\n00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,860\nI'll just leave it like that, and now all\nof my various services are turned on.\n\n363\n00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,530\nThese are all the network services\nthat are a part of iCloud.\n\n364\n00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,220\nIf I wanna see some of them in action,\n\n365\n00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,460\nI'm probably gonna have to do a little\nbit more work, to get it going.\n\n366\n00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,360\nBut let's see if we can't show at\nleast a little bit of this working.\n\n367\n00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,290\nNotice on my Find My Mac, I'm getting\na warning, Mac can't be located.\n\n368\n00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,820\nWell this particular machine\nis a virtual machine, and\n\n369\n00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,990\na virtual machine doesn't have a GPS.\n\n370\n00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,920\nSo it doesn't have a way\nto locate the Mac.\n\n371\n00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,720\nWhile I am connected to Find My Mac,\nI can't actually use it,\n\n372\n00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,410\nbecause I don't have any kind of\nlocation device in the virtual machine.\n\n373\n00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,970\nNow if I were to go and turn that on on my\nlaptop, we might see something different,\n\n374\n00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,320\nin fact, let's do that.\n\n375\n00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,480\nI'm gonna jump over to my actual laptop.\n\n376\n00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,938\nSo here I am on my actual laptop.\n\n377\n00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:25,400\nLet's get all this stuff out of the way.\n\n378\n00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,220\nWhoops.\n\n379\n00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,410\nThere we go.\n\n380\n00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,360\nAnd I'll just go into\nmy System Preferences.\n\n381\n00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,010\nAnd I'll go into iCloud.\n\n382\n00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,610\nAnd you'll see I'm not signed in.\n\n383\n00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,470\nI mentioned that I don't sign into iCloud\ncuz I don't want a bunch of notifications\n\n384\n00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,440\nduring the show.\n\n385\n00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,320\nBut I'll log in with that lab account.\n\n386\n00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,810\nThis will probably mess\nup all sorts of things.\n\n387\n00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,410\nWe'll see how it goes.\n\n388\n00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,812\nI'll get logged in And\nget my own laptop set up for this.\n\n389\n00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:54,790\nNow, I'm signing in with the same iCloud\naccount that I did on the virtual machine.\n\n390\n00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,080\nJust like in real life, you might sign in\nwith the same account on your laptop and\n\n391\n00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,060\nyour desktop, and\n\n392\n00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,310\nthat's what's gonna enable that\nsynchronization between the devices.\n\n393\n00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,240\nSo, it's going ahead and\noffering to turn those same services on.\n\n394\n00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,790\nAnd we'll just let it enable, I'll allow\nthe synchronization of these settings.\n\n395\n00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,130\nI'll Find My Mac.\n\n396\n00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,920\nAnd here it's telling me to set\nup iCloud keychain on this Mac.\n\n397\n00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,340\nI've got to get approval, from one of\nthe other devices that's out there.\n\n398\n00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,065\nI can hit request approval and\nit's going to send a message.\n\n399\n00:19:30,065 --> 00:19:33,880\nTo the other devices I have\nset up that are using iCloud.\n\n400\n00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,970\nAll right?\n\n401\n00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,160\nIt's telling me an approval request\nhas been sent, and what I should see\n\n402\n00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,800\nis if I go over to this device, right\nhere I can see that I just got a message.\n\n403\n00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,540\niCloud Keychain DP Laptop OS X\nwants to use your passwords.\n\n404\n00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,240\nRight?\n\n405\n00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,520\nI'm gonna view that and\n\n406\n00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,520\nI'll see in here where I can come in and\nchoose to allow it or deny it.\n\n407\n00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,910\nOkay, so do I wanna allow it?\n\n408\n00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,790\nI punch it in, or I can say don't\nallow and that'll turn it off.\n\n409\n00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,340\nI'll go ahead and allow it,\n\n410\n00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,813\nand that's gonna allow that Keychain\nsynchronization between the two systems.\n\n411\n00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:07,355\nAll right.\n\n412\n00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:08,950\nSo now all that's set up.\n\n413\n00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,010\nWe're good to go.\n\n414\n00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,730\nI can turn on Back to\nMy Mac here also if I want.\n\n415\n00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,880\nIt's gonna turn on.\n\n416\n00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,420\nI'm not getting a warning about\nsetting up sharing settings,\n\n417\n00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,380\nprobably because I've already got them on,\non my desktop.\n\n418\n00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,750\nI do screen sharing on my desktop anyway.\n\n419\n00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,800\nI'm not getting a warning there,\n\n420\n00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,890\nversus the other machine where\nI did get warnings about it.\n\n421\n00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,880\nAll right, it is telling me I\nneed to set up my router so\n\n422\n00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,610\nI might have some issues there.\n\n423\n00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,521\nBut at least my screen\nsharing is turned on.\n\n424\n00:20:34,355 --> 00:20:36,269\nAll right, once that's turned on,\n\n425\n00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:39,280\nnow these two devices\nare starting to synchronize.\n\n426\n00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,800\nAnd what I'll be able to do is jump\ninto my notes, for example and\n\n427\n00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,570\nif I start to create a note.\n\n428\n00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:49,850\nThis is a very important note, be aware.\n\n429\n00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,620\nThere we go, all right.\n\n430\n00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,370\nSo I made a note.\n\n431\n00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,170\nVery, very exciting.\n\n432\n00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,870\nI've got that note made, and the note was\nmade right here on my own machine, right.\n\n433\n00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,920\nWhen I go into it, there it is,\nI can see it, terribly exciting.\n\n434\n00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,630\nAnd see how I've got iCloud\nnotes right here and\n\n435\n00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,370\nthat's what that note is showing\nup there is my iCloud note.\n\n436\n00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,970\nAnd if I jump back over to my desktop,\nwithin a few moments,\n\n437\n00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,310\nthat note will synchronize down to here\nand I'll be able to go into my notes\n\n438\n00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,680\nand I can see that iCloud note right here.\n\n439\n00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,980\nHere's that new note and\nit hasn't picked up its name yet, so\n\n440\n00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,240\nit's still synchronizing.\n\n441\n00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,810\nI need to wait.\n\n442\n00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:27,780\nThere it goes.\n\n443\n00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,550\nJust appeared right there.\n\n444\n00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,830\nThis is a very important note.\n\n445\n00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,540\nNow I've got that synchronization\nbetween my system.\n\n446\n00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,240\nAnd you guys know from watching this show,\nI haven't touched my firewall or anything.\n\n447\n00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,590\nThis set itself up.\n\n448\n00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,640\nRight?\nIt set itself up to be able to reach out\n\n449\n00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,490\nand pull that data.\n\n450\n00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,130\nAnd, if I didn't have my computer handy,\nI could always fire up my web browser.\n\n451\n00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,670\nLet me fire up Safari.\n\n452\n00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,920\nAnd in Safari, if I go to iCloud.com.\n\n453\n00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,240\nI can browse the iCloud website.\n\n454\n00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,810\nI can browse there very very slowly,\napparently.\n\n455\n00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,820\nThere we go.\n\n456\n00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:08,841\nI can log in with that iCloud account And,\n\n457\n00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:12,590\nonce I get logged in, I'll be able\nto access some of those resources.\n\n458\n00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:16,840\nI can log in here, and\nI'll see my Notes, right here.\n\n459\n00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,840\nAnd, if I go into Notes,\nthis is a very important note,right?\n\n460\n00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,170\nNow, I've got that nice easy\naccess between my systems.\n\n461\n00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,400\nNow, I'm putting a lot of\ntrust in Apple here, right?\n\n462\n00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,370\nI'm trusting Apple to store this data\nsecurely, and secure my communication.\n\n463\n00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,880\nAnd they've got a pretty good\ntrack record for that, right?\n\n464\n00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,330\nTheir big exploit what was it, a year ago?\n\n465\n00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,770\nWas caused by people using weak passwords,\n\n466\n00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,750\nor re-using passwords\nthey used on other sites.\n\n467\n00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,310\nApple's tried to fix that by doing\nthe Second Factor Authentication.\n\n468\n00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,360\nBut, it is still a level of trust, and a\nlot of people aren't ready to do that and\n\n469\n00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,700\nso you certainly don't have\nto use these features.\n\n470\n00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,272\nBut, it is kind of nice to be\nable to have that functionality.\n\n471\n00:22:55,438 --> 00:22:56,790\nAll right.\nSome of the other things,\n\n472\n00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,350\nlike Find My iPhone.\n\n473\n00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,560\nIf I go to Find My iPhone,\nI know my virtual machine is not reporting\n\n474\n00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,210\ninformation back, and so\nthat's not gonna help.\n\n475\n00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,780\nBut if I come in here,\nI can pull up other devices.\n\n476\n00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,390\nSo here's DPLAPTOP-OSX, and I can click on\nthat, and it's gonna show me where it is.\n\n477\n00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:18,560\nMy laptop does have a GPS transmitter in\nit, and so it is able to locate itself,\n\n478\n00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,870\nand looking at the map it's gonna figure\nout where it thinks that I am, and\n\n479\n00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,470\nlet's zoom in on that a bit and\nsee how close it got.\n\n480\n00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,400\nThat is basically spot on.\n\n481\n00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,740\nOur studio is right on this\ncorner here of the building, and\n\n482\n00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,940\nI usually park right around there,\nso it's got me pretty darn close\n\n483\n00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,620\nto where my facility is, now I know,\noh, my laptop's at work.\n\n484\n00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,750\nAll right.\n\n485\n00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,930\nNow my other machine,\nwhich was just called Don's Macbook Pro,\n\n486\n00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,320\nif I click on that one it's online,\nbut no location is available.\n\n487\n00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,710\nIt doesn't have a GPS transmitter.\n\n488\n00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,477\nI know it's online.\nI can make it play a sound I can\n\n489\n00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:55,558\nlock its screen, I can erase the mac\nwhich wipes out your user profile,\n\n490\n00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,299\nI can do a lot of that stuff remotely\nI just don't know where it is so\n\n491\n00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:03,339\nif its lost and I don't think I'm ever\ngonna get it back I can erase it.\n\n492\n00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:04,227\nWipe my data.\n\n493\n00:24:04,227 --> 00:24:06,583\nIt'll do a secure delete\nof your user profile.\n\n494\n00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,600\nAll right.\n\n495\n00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,030\nSo nice little options there.\n\n496\n00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,220\nBut the other one I mentioned,\nwas Back to My Mac.\n\n497\n00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,890\nRight?\nBack to My Mac where I can jump and\n\n498\n00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,120\nsee the screen of the other system.\n\n499\n00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,020\nNow, that's one of hardest\nones to get working because of\n\n500\n00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,670\nNetwork address translation, and firewalls\nthat are sitting in between the clients.\n\n501\n00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,240\nSo, because I haven't configured mine,\nI'm not sure if it will work, but\n\n502\n00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,300\nwe can certainly give it a try.\n\n503\n00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,140\nBack to My Mac does not work\nfrom the iCloud webpage.\n\n504\n00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,720\nYou probably noticed while\nI was here in iCloud,\n\n505\n00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,810\nnone of these stayed Back at My Mac,\nright?\n\n506\n00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,200\nSo you just can't go to the webpage and\nconnect to your Mac.\n\n507\n00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,980\nYou have to go to another Mac OS machine,\npreferably one running [INAUDIBLE].\n\n508\n00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,220\nGo to that machine,\nlog in with your iCloud account,\n\n509\n00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,480\nit's got to be logged in\nwith the same Apple ID and\n\n510\n00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,380\nthen you should be able to see\na remote machine in the Finder.\n\n511\n00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,990\nLet me show you what I mean,\nif I jump back here into my Finder.\n\n512\n00:25:03,776 --> 00:25:08,600\nAll right, on the left side I'm seeing\nthings like my favorites, other devices,\n\n513\n00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:14,382\nand as I scroll down, I'll see Shared,\nthese are systems that are on my network.\n\n514\n00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:17,410\nAnd I see some of the other computers\nthat are here like Tim's Mac,\n\n515\n00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,050\nand Nate's PC, and stuffs.\n\n516\n00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,790\nSo I'm seeing other computers,\n\n517\n00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:24,600\nI don't see that other virtual\nmachine that I've got fired up.\n\n518\n00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,757\nIt's not showing up there.\n\n519\n00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:31,260\nAnd if I jump over here to this guy,\nand I fire up his Finder.\n\n520\n00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,970\nAnd I look, I see Shared.\n\n521\n00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,670\nIt does see DP Laptop OSX II,\nso it is seeing that machine.\n\n522\n00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,910\nBut my other one isn't.\n\n523\n00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,000\nWell you can have this sometimes,\nyou know the firewalls or\n\n524\n00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,040\nthe configurations might be stopping\nthe communications one way or another.\n\n525\n00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,300\nYou know the other thing, actually I\nalmost forgot this, I'm seeing Shared.\n\n526\n00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,470\nThese may be being detected locally, so\n\n527\n00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,160\nI'm actually just seeing them\nacross the regular network.\n\n528\n00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,500\nI may not be displaying\nmy iCloud settings.\n\n529\n00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,240\nAll right.\n\n530\n00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,790\nIn the Finder there's actually\nsome preferences that can\n\n531\n00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,130\ntailor what shows up in this side bar.\n\n532\n00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,310\nIf I go up to Finder in my menu,\nand go to Preferences,\n\n533\n00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,810\nin the Preferences I can choose Sidebar,\nand in the Sidebar you'll see\n\n534\n00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,180\nall sorts of different things you\ncan turn on and under Shared.\n\n535\n00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,000\nIs Back to My Mac, all right?\n\n536\n00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,850\nWhen you check that off it'll show any\nother computers that are signed in with\n\n537\n00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,250\nyour Apple ID, and\nBack to My Mac is turned on.\n\n538\n00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:29,190\nSo I do have that turned on over here,\nand I'm seeing DP laptop.\n\n539\n00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,050\nAnd if I jump over here, let's see if\nI've got it turned on on this one.\n\n540\n00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,920\nI'll go into my Preferences and Sidebar,\nand Back to My Mac is turned on.\n\n541\n00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,100\nOh, I'm forgetting something.\n\n542\n00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,140\nI mentioned how Back to My Mac won't work\nunless you turn on screen sharing, and\n\n543\n00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,930\nI haven't done that.\n\n544\n00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,870\nSo let me show you that little step.\n\n545\n00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:50,480\nI've done it on my own laptop, but\nI haven't done it on this virtual machine.\n\n546\n00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,710\nSo, for this virtual machine,\nif I go into my\n\n547\n00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:02,370\nSystem Preferences and\ninto my Sharing Preference.\n\n548\n00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,300\nWe're going to talk a lot more about\nthe other options that are in here, but\n\n549\n00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,460\nfor right now the one I'm looking for\nis Screen Sharing,\n\n550\n00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,840\nand I'm going to turn that on.\n\n551\n00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,610\nAnd I'm gonna set it to allow access for\ncertain users.\n\n552\n00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,580\nThese are the users that will be\nallowed to use Back to My Mac.\n\n553\n00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,910\nSo do I want it to be just administrators,\nthat's the default.\n\n554\n00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,670\nOr do I want it to be all users, or\n\n555\n00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,560\nI can leave it administrators and\nthen add in individual people.\n\n556\n00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,960\nSo I could add myself in here if I wanted.\n\n557\n00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,060\nMaybe I'm not an administrator,\nso I can add myself to that list.\n\n558\n00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,330\nI'm now allowed to use Back\nto My Mac on this machine.\n\n559\n00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,900\nSo, now that that's turn on,\n\n560\n00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,730\nScreen Sharing is enabled,\nnow we should be able to get in there.\n\n561\n00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,100\nDon't confuse that with some of the other\noptions in here, like Remote Login, and\n\n562\n00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,990\nRemote Management,\nthose control other things.\n\n563\n00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,110\nScreen Sharing is what's for\nBack to My Mac.\n\n564\n00:27:50,688 --> 00:27:54,890\nAll right, now that's set, it may take\na moment to synchronize to the other side.\n\n565\n00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,464\nLet me just jump [COUGH]\nover to the other side and\n\n566\n00:27:57,464 --> 00:27:59,855\nsee if I'm seeing anything over here yet.\n\n567\n00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:03,925\nIt'll turn up in here, and sure enough,\nI see Don's Macbook Pro right there.\n\n568\n00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:05,605\nDon's Macbook Pro.\n\n569\n00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:08,435\nThat's the other machine that I\njust turned on Back to My Mac, and\n\n570\n00:28:08,435 --> 00:28:10,345\nI turned on Screen Sharing for.\n\n571\n00:28:10,345 --> 00:28:11,185\nSo I see it.\n\n572\n00:28:11,185 --> 00:28:12,745\nIt's showing up under Shared.\n\n573\n00:28:12,745 --> 00:28:15,445\nAnd the only option I have\nover here is Share Screen.\n\n574\n00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:20,950\nOn the other side, when it saw my laptop,\nsee how it showed some folders?\n\n575\n00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,150\nI have some shared folders on my laptop.\n\n576\n00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,750\nBut the Share Screen\nbutton is just up there.\n\n577\n00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,260\nIt's still out there,\nwe can share that screen.\n\n578\n00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,580\nIf I go to my laptop, though, I see\nDon's MacBook Pro, I can hit Share Screen,\n\n579\n00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,900\nand it's gonna reach out and\nconnect to that system.\n\n580\n00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,490\nAnd see how it didn't even prompt me for\nuser IDs?\n\n581\n00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,950\nThat's because of the key\nchain synchronization.\n\n582\n00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,690\nMy key chain is synchronized,\nI'm logged in as Don Pizett on my laptop.\n\n583\n00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,780\nI'm logged in as Don Pizett on that VM.\n\n584\n00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,740\nIt's the same account.\n\n585\n00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,010\nSo it's already able to authenticate me,\nand\n\n586\n00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,640\nnow I'm looking at the screen\nof that Remote Machine.\n\n587\n00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,010\nIt might be at my house,\nbut then I'm at work.\n\n588\n00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:01,310\nI might be across the country and remoting\ninto a machine back here in the studio.\n\n589\n00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,800\nEither way, we see it,\nand we connect to it.\n\n590\n00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,750\nThat's something that we get with iCloud.\n\n591\n00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,310\nThat synchronization\nthrough Apple's servers.\n\n592\n00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:11,390\nThese are some of the network\nservices that Apple provides.\n\n593\n00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:17,990\nNow, all of those are well and good, but\nmaybe you're not ready for that, right.\n\n594\n00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,180\nYou're not ready to trust\nApple with all that control.\n\n595\n00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:26,680\nIn which case, you can configure a lot of\nthings on your own without using iCloud.\n\n596\n00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,470\nAnd that's what I'm gonna show\nyou in the rest of the show.\n\n597\n00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,360\nThe rest of the time we'll spend\njust configuring our own services.\n\n598\n00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,940\nBut these are the iCloud ones and\nit's pretty stable.\n\n599\n00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,760\nAll right.\n\n600\n00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,910\nGot a question in the chat\nroom about Natch Reversal.\n\n601\n00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,680\nNatch reversal is when\nthis Back to My Mac or\n\n602\n00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,580\nwhatever has to go through a router\nthat's doing NAT, and in my scenario,\n\n603\n00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,440\nthat Virtual Machine that I'm\nrunning is actually being natted.\n\n604\n00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,000\nIn fact, it's being double natted.\n\n605\n00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,710\nIt's natted going into my\nvirtual machine network, and\n\n606\n00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,810\nnatted again on the way\nout to the internet.\n\n607\n00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,920\nSo it's actually designed to handle that,\nand the UPnP settings normally handle it.\n\n608\n00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,120\nI'm blocking UPnP on my network, and\n\n609\n00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,860\nit still functions,\neven though I'm being natted.\n\n610\n00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,690\nSo it's really good about that,\nand we don't have to customize it.\n\n611\n00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,810\nApple tried to make it as\nconvenient as possible.\n\n612\n00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,820\nAlright, well let's stop here.\n\n613\n00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,576\nDuring the break,\nwe're about to take a break.\n\n614\n00:30:14,576 --> 00:30:17,960\n[LAUGH] And during the break, I'm going\nto turn off all this iCloud stuff, so\n\n615\n00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,210\nthat we can then go back in, and get\na chance to see things configured without\n\n616\n00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,750\niCloud, just configuring our own services.\n\n617\n00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,857\nSo that's what's going to\ncome up in a moment, but\n\n618\n00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:29,192\ngive me a minute to clean my system up,\nand we'll jump back into that after this.\n\n619\n00:30:29,192 --> 00:30:36,076\n[MUSIC]\n\n620\n00:30:36,076 --> 00:30:38,742\nAlright, welcome back, everybody.\n\n621\n00:30:38,742 --> 00:30:42,780\nSo let's say that we want to share\nresources between our Macs, but\n\n622\n00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,630\nwe don't want to rely on Apple for that.\n\n623\n00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:49,820\nWell unfortunately that is gonna cut\nout most of our internet based sharing.\n\n624\n00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,590\nBut for our local computers we can still\ndo a lot of sharing pretty easily.\n\n625\n00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,800\nSo, if I have a couple of desktops or\na laptop, and a desktop or\n\n626\n00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,390\nwhatever, sharing information\nbetween them is extremely simple.\n\n627\n00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:04,470\nThe only thing complex is how much\nof the possibilities we have.\n\n628\n00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,430\nThere's actually a lot of different\nthings that we can turn on.\n\n629\n00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,000\nSo I wanna walk through each of\nthe different things that we can share,\n\n630\n00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,860\nthe various services we can create\nright from our own machine, right?\n\n631\n00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,990\nSo I'm gonna start here right\non my own little machine, and\n\n632\n00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,330\nI'll just go up into\nmy System Preferences.\n\n633\n00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,940\nAnd inside of my System Preferences,\n\n634\n00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,250\nyou'll see a preference\npane called Sharing.\n\n635\n00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,550\nIt's this guy right here, this little\nfolder with a person walking sign on it.\n\n636\n00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,290\nAnd if we go into Sharing,\n\n637\n00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,910\nwe'll see the different things\nthat we're able to share out.\n\n638\n00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,430\nSo I can see, for example,\nmy computer name.\n\n639\n00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,210\nWhen people see the things I'm sharing,\n\n640\n00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,060\nthis is the name of\nthe computer they'll see.\n\n641\n00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:41,070\nNow, it says Don's Macbook Pro, but\nI'm on a Virtual Machine, and so\n\n642\n00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,690\nthat's not really that accurate.\n\n643\n00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,990\nSo I'll call it my Mac OS VM.\n\n644\n00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,430\nJust so I can remember what it is.\n\n645\n00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,930\nI'm changing the name of my machine, so\n\n646\n00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:53,040\nI'll be able to recognize it\na little bit better in my Finder.\n\n647\n00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,310\nThen I can choose the things\nthat I want to share.\n\n648\n00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,288\nDo I want to share my DVD or CD drive?\n\n649\n00:31:57,288 --> 00:31:58,940\nI can, right?\n\n650\n00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,969\nIf I have a CD in the drive.\n\n651\n00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:03,180\nSo for example,\nlet me put a CD in my drive,\n\n652\n00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,390\nI can connect an Image file,\nlet's see what I've got.\n\n653\n00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,613\nI'm sure I've got something here,\na Linux CD.\n\n654\n00:32:09,613 --> 00:32:12,258\nSo, if I pop a CD in my drive,\nthere we go,\n\n655\n00:32:12,258 --> 00:32:17,460\nmaybe I have a MacBook that doesn't\nhave a CD drive, well, like mine.\n\n656\n00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,310\nAnd so I wanna connect to the CD\ndrive on some other computer.\n\n657\n00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,290\nWell, I can go to the other computer, and\nI can choose to share, the CD or DVD.\n\n658\n00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,310\nAnd so, now that one's gonna be\nshared out and made available.\n\n659\n00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,948\nAnd see how it's saying ask me before\nallowing other users to use my DVD drive,\n\n660\n00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,454\nit's gonna prompt about that.\n\n661\n00:32:32,454 --> 00:32:36,493\nSo if you put a DVD with personal data in\nthere they won't just be able to connect.\n\n662\n00:32:36,493 --> 00:32:38,540\nI'm gonna turn that off cuz\nI'm not worried about it.\n\n663\n00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,810\nI'm gonna let people get to it and\n\n664\n00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:43,980\nthey'll be able to access that DVD\ndrive whenever they want, all right?\n\n665\n00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,220\nScreen sharing.\n\n666\n00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,960\nWe saw screen sharing before the break.\n\n667\n00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,000\nThat was using Back to My Mac.\n\n668\n00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,540\nBut I can turn on screen sharing\njust from my local network, too.\n\n669\n00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,080\nOther computers on my local network\nwill be able to find this machine and\n\n670\n00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,660\nview its screen.\n\n671\n00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,320\nNow not just anybody,\nwe do need to authenticate.\n\n672\n00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,180\nI didn't have to authenticate with\nBack to My Mac because I was already\n\n673\n00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,160\nauthenticated, thanks to my keychain.\n\n674\n00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,300\nI was logged in to iCloud.\n\n675\n00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,960\nBut for regular screen sharing\nwe will have to authenticate.\n\n676\n00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,280\nAnd so we can specify what users\nwe want to allow access and\n\n677\n00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,220\nthese are the people who will be allowed\nto provide credentials to connect, right?\n\n678\n00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,449\nNow the screen sharing in Mac OS is\nactually powered by a software program\n\n679\n00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:25,097\ncalled VNC, or virtual network computing.\n\n680\n00:33:25,097 --> 00:33:30,228\nVNC was developed by AT&T, but\nit's open standard to be able to use.\n\n681\n00:33:30,228 --> 00:33:32,590\nThey have their own commercial\ngrade software, but\n\n682\n00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,720\nthe standard itself is open and that's\nwhat Apple has adopted for their system.\n\n683\n00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,850\nSo when I share my desktop out,\nit's using VNC.\n\n684\n00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:45,290\nWell the idea is I'll go to another Mac,\nand I'll use it to connect to the screen.\n\n685\n00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,020\nBut what if I wanna connect from\na Windows machine, or a Linux machine?\n\n686\n00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,670\nWell I can turn on raw VNC support.\n\n687\n00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:55,880\nIf you go under Computer Settings,\nyou'll see an option in here that says\n\n688\n00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,290\nanyone may request permission\nto control the screen.\n\n689\n00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,930\nThat would be users nonamalous.\n\n690\n00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,470\nThey can request to connect.\n\n691\n00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:06,520\nAnd then VNC viewers may control\nthe screen with a password, and\n\n692\n00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,950\nI can provide a password.\n\n693\n00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:12,493\nIf we do that you can get\nany VNC client you want.\n\n694\n00:34:12,493 --> 00:34:16,642\nTight VNC, there's a ton of them that\nare out there that you can get, and\n\n695\n00:34:16,642 --> 00:34:17,403\nyou can run.\n\n696\n00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:21,664\nAnd when you fire up those VNC clients,\nyou point to the machine you wanna connect\n\n697\n00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:24,900\nto, and you just type in\nwhatever this password is, right?\n\n698\n00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,560\nAnd that'll let you connect to a Windows\nmachine, or a Linux box, or whatever.\n\n699\n00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,060\nWell, I'm not gonna do that,\nI'm just gonna connect for Mac, so\n\n700\n00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,850\nI'll turn those off.\n\n701\n00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,020\nBut that's what those other options are.\n\n702\n00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,530\nWe got file sharing.\n\n703\n00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,640\nIf we wanna share folders out,\nwe can do that.\n\n704\n00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,600\nNow, when we share a folder, right,\nso if I check off file sharing here,\n\n705\n00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,360\nI've already got a public\nfolder that's being shared out,\n\n706\n00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,310\nthe one that's in my user profile.\n\n707\n00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,150\nAnd so it shows me the permissions\nthat can be used to access that.\n\n708\n00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,680\nI can come in and\nadd other folders though.\n\n709\n00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,790\nSo for example maybe inside of\nmy documents I come in here and\n\n710\n00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:03,360\nI create a new folder which I'm\ngonna call my shared documents.\n\n711\n00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,760\nAnd I wanna share those out\nwith certain people, right?\n\n712\n00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,570\nSo I wanna have these things\navailable to specific people.\n\n713\n00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:15,450\nWell, I can go under my shared folders,\nand I can hit that plus sign, and\n\n714\n00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,653\nI can choose the folder\nthat I want to add.\n\n715\n00:35:17,653 --> 00:35:22,360\nAnd so I'm adding it right there and\nI can set permissions on it.\n\n716\n00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,706\nNow be aware of this.\n\n717\n00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:28,631\nYour share permissions don't have to\nmatch the permissions that are on\n\n718\n00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:29,788\nthe hard drive.\n\n719\n00:35:29,788 --> 00:35:30,509\nThey can be different.\n\n720\n00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:33,361\nThe permissions that\nare on the hard drive,\n\n721\n00:35:33,361 --> 00:35:36,800\nthose are the regular\nfile systems permissions.\n\n722\n00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,070\nThose apply when somebody's\nsitting right at your computer.\n\n723\n00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,970\nBut when they come in over the network,\nthese are the permissions that apply and\n\n724\n00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,200\nthey can be different.\n\n725\n00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,000\nNow, how does it maintain two\ndifferent sets of permissions?\n\n726\n00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,880\nWell it does in an interesting way.\n\n727\n00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,860\nIf I fire up my terminal.\n\n728\n00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,200\nI'll show you how this works.\n\n729\n00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:58,430\nSo in my terminal,\nif I look in my own user profile, right?\n\n730\n00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,560\nSo I'm in /Users/donpezet.\n\n731\n00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,830\nAnd if I get into /Documents,\n\n732\n00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:07,510\nthere's my shared documents folder that\nI just made, right, buried under here.\n\n733\n00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:12,660\nThat is the local copy of that folder,\nand that's where it sits.\n\n734\n00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,194\nAnd it's got permissions\nthat are assigned to it.\n\n735\n00:36:14,194 --> 00:36:19,061\nWhen I share it,\nit creates another location that has\n\n736\n00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:24,156\nsymbolic links that point\nto the actual files, right.\n\n737\n00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:27,904\nAnd the reason it creates this\nlinks is that can set different\n\n738\n00:36:27,904 --> 00:36:31,960\npermissions on the link than on\nthe actual files themselves.\n\n739\n00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,590\nSo I can maintain\nseparation of permissions.\n\n740\n00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:38,150\nI can be more or less restrictive\nwith my share permissions, or more or\n\n741\n00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,330\nless restrictive with my file permissions.\n\n742\n00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,930\nI have that flexibility.\n\n743\n00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,772\nThose links are in the /Network folder.\n\n744\n00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:48,738\nIf you haven't turned on folder sharing\nyour /Network folder is usually gonna\n\n745\n00:36:48,738 --> 00:36:49,278\nbe empty.\n\n746\n00:36:49,278 --> 00:36:51,170\nThere's not gonna be anything in there.\n\n747\n00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,922\nBut if you've turned on folder sharing,\nwhen you go into /Network,\n\n748\n00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:57,605\nyou'll usually see a couple\nof folders in there.\n\n749\n00:36:57,605 --> 00:36:58,788\nAnd did I not hit Apply?\n\n750\n00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:04,040\n[LAUGH] Looks like my settings\nhaven't actually applied yet.\n\n751\n00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,880\nAs soon as those apply,\nI changed my computer name and so\n\n752\n00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,610\nit's not happy about that just yet.\n\n753\n00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,900\nBut as soon as all these\nsettings apply what I'll see is\n\n754\n00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:17,060\ndata appear inside of this /Network folder\nto reflect the stuff that I'm sharing out.\n\n755\n00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,820\nLet me show you here,\n\n756\n00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,925\non my desktop, so I'm doing it on my\ndesktop, I share some documents out.\n\n757\n00:37:20,925 --> 00:37:27,032\nAnd so,\non my own desktop if I go into /Network,\n\n758\n00:37:27,032 --> 00:37:32,910\nright, I can see, right there,\nthis folder called Servers.\n\n759\n00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,490\nAnd if I go into the Servers folder\n\n760\n00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,050\nI should see two symbolic directories,\nall right?\n\n761\n00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,790\nThey'll both point to\nthe name of your laptop.\n\n762\n00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,120\nOne of them is just the name\nof your device, and\n\n763\n00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,010\nthe other's the name of your device\nwith the DNS suffix of your device.\n\n764\n00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,910\nAnd if you haven't\nchanged your DNS suffix,\n\n765\n00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,390\nyour DNS domain name,\nthen it'll be .local.\n\n766\n00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,796\nSo must people will see it something\nlike this, Dons MacBook Pro and\n\n767\n00:37:55,796 --> 00:37:57,440\nDons MacBook Pro.local.\n\n768\n00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,760\nThey actually both point\nto the same place, right?\n\n769\n00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,110\nSee how the pointer is to just / the root,\nright?\n\n770\n00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,730\nSo they both point to the same place.\n\n771\n00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,935\nIt's just the two different\nnames that people might use and\n\n772\n00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:09,960\ntry to connect to my laptop.\n\n773\n00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:18,000\nAnd if I browse into either of those what\nI'm seeing is a view of my hard drive.\n\n774\n00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,770\nBut this view of my\nhard drive is different\n\n775\n00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,700\nbecause it can have different permissions.\n\n776\n00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,180\nThey can maintain different permissions\non the links than on the actual files.\n\n777\n00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:33,700\nAnd so as I start to navigate through\nhere, what I'm seeing is something that is\n\n778\n00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:39,400\noh, I actually went the wrong directory\nthat's wait a minute, where am I?\n\n779\n00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,850\nOh, I'm sorry, I'm looking for that\ndirectory I made in my virtual machine,\n\n780\n00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,790\nnot on my desktop.\n\n781\n00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,780\nBut now that I'm navigating in here it\nlooks like I'm navigating through these\n\n782\n00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,420\nactual folders.\n\n783\n00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:54,150\nBut if I pull up my path, I can see I'm\nin that /Network folder right there.\n\n784\n00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,730\nSo I'm inside this /Network to\nmaintain those separate permissions.\n\n785\n00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,890\nThat's why we have that\nextra folder that shows up.\n\n786\n00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,130\nFor the most part you can just ignore it.\n\n787\n00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,300\nThese are the permissions we're\nassigning when we share out\n\n788\n00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,570\nthe resources right here.\n\n789\n00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,410\nSo I can go into my shared documents, and\n\n790\n00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,000\nI can say I want Don Pezet\nto have read/write.\n\n791\n00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,420\nStaff can have read-only, but everyone,\nI want everyone to have no access.\n\n792\n00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,700\nI can change that, versus on the local\nsystem, if somebody sits down and logs in,\n\n793\n00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,070\nmaybe I do want them to have access.\n\n794\n00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,130\nI can customize that as I need.\n\n795\n00:39:23,117 --> 00:39:25,730\nSome of the other things I can do,\nPrinter Sharing.\n\n796\n00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,370\nIf I have a printer on this system\nI can check it off and share it.\n\n797\n00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:29,550\nI don't have any printers right now.\n\n798\n00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,780\nBut you could add them in and specify the\nusers that were allowed to print to them.\n\n799\n00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,790\nI've got Remote Login.\n\n800\n00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:40,590\nNow remote login, a lot of people confuse\nthis with the screen sharing, right?\n\n801\n00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:45,950\nWith remote login we're talking about SSH,\nwhich is secure shell and\n\n802\n00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,890\nSFTP, secure file transfer protocol.\n\n803\n00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,515\nThese are ways that we can\naccess the terminal and\n\n804\n00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,810\nour file system from our remote system.\n\n805\n00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,220\nThese are really Unix protocols,\n\n806\n00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,530\nsecure shell to be able to get that\ncommand line interface to work.\n\n807\n00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:03,285\nOr SFTP to use secure file transfers.\n\n808\n00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:07,405\nIt's really FTP being run over SSH.\n\n809\n00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,447\nSo, that's how it gets its security.\n\n810\n00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:12,093\nWe can turn that functionality on and\nspecify who's allowed to use it.\n\n811\n00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:13,585\nBy default, administrators would be.\n\n812\n00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:16,139\nWe'll go ahead and turn it on.\n\n813\n00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:18,640\nThen we got remote management.\n\n814\n00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,030\nFor home users and small businesses,\nyou're not gonna use this.\n\n815\n00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,920\nBut for large organizations and\n\n816\n00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,670\nenterprises, there's a product from Apple\ncalled Apple Remote Desktop, ARD, right?\n\n817\n00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,820\nI know the name, remote desktop,\nit makes you think of screen sharing.\n\n818\n00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,510\nThat's what it is in the Microsoft world.\n\n819\n00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:40,190\nBut in the Apple world, Apple Remote\nDesktop is designed from management.\n\n820\n00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:44,630\nIf you have a network team, a network\noperations center, a tech support team,\n\n821\n00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:49,610\nthose people need to be able to see your\ncomputers, copy files to your computers,\n\n822\n00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:53,090\ndeploy updates, reboot, do all sorts\nof remote management of your computers.\n\n823\n00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,530\nThey need to be able to do that.\n\n824\n00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:58,110\nAnd they can't depend on\nservices like iCloud for that.\n\n825\n00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,210\niCloud's really designed for\nindividual users, not companies.\n\n826\n00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:05,590\nApple Remote Desktop is kind of like\na personal iCloud for your company.\n\n827\n00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,380\nAnd that's what we're\nturning on right here.\n\n828\n00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,990\nWhen we check remote management,\nwe're turning on the ability for\n\n829\n00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,640\nApple Remote Desktop to work.\n\n830\n00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,770\nAnd we specify the different\nfunctions that we want to enable.\n\n831\n00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,940\nDo we want them to be\nable to see our screen?\n\n832\n00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,560\nIf they can see our screen do we\nwant them to control the screen?\n\n833\n00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,130\nDo we want them to notify us when\nthey're watching the screen?\n\n834\n00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,220\nOr do we want them to do it silently?\n\n835\n00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,390\nRight?\nSo we don't even know they're watching.\n\n836\n00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,100\nNow, I know what you're thinking,\nwhy would I want somebody else to do this?\n\n837\n00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,140\nWell, if you're a corporate entity and\nyou're managing these machines you need\n\n838\n00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,020\nthat functionality and the end users\nwouldn't be turning this stuff on.\n\n839\n00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,440\nYou would set these settings and\n\n840\n00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,980\npush them to the device before you\neven gave the device to the end user.\n\n841\n00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,530\nSo these are things that you\nwould configure from there.\n\n842\n00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,660\nBut we've got a lot more\nthan just screen sharing.\n\n843\n00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,420\nWe've got things like\nreporting information.\n\n844\n00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,220\nWe can pull what version\nthe systems are running.\n\n845\n00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,180\nWhen they've been updated.\n\n846\n00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,430\nWhat applications they're running.\n\n847\n00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,170\nAll sorts of data there.\n\n848\n00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:02,600\nWe can open and quit applications,\nso we can force programs to stop.\n\n849\n00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,460\nThis is useful for troubleshooting.\n\n850\n00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,880\nWe can change their settings and\npreferences, delete and replace items.\n\n851\n00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,260\nMost of this stuff is\npretty self-explanatory.\n\n852\n00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,370\nWe can start a text chat or send messages.\n\n853\n00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,490\nIf we're trying to communicate with them\nand we're on the phone that's one thing.\n\n854\n00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,530\nBut if the phone is what\nwe're trying to troubleshoot,\n\n855\n00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,340\nthis is another mechanism\nwe can use to communicate.\n\n856\n00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:25,890\nWe can reboot or shut down the machine,\nand we can copy items to that hard drive.\n\n857\n00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:31,550\nWe turn all these on, a tech support\ntechnician, or a network operations\n\n858\n00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:36,140\ncenter can use Apple Remote Desktop\nto connect to manage these systems.\n\n859\n00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,780\nNow I'll put a link in the show notes,\n\n860\n00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,280\nthe Apple Remote Desktop website\nwhere they explain the product.\n\n861\n00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,370\nIt's a very complex product.\n\n862\n00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,740\nIt's very powerful.\n\n863\n00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,550\nIt's not free.\n\n864\n00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:47,680\nIt cost $80 in the Apple App store,\nwhich if you're a home user,\n\n865\n00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,150\nthat sounds like a lot of money.\n\n866\n00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,620\nIt's not designed for you.\n\n867\n00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,059\nBut if you're managing a 1,000 Macs,\n\n868\n00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:57,410\n$80, be able to manage 1,000 Macs,\nthat's a drop in the bucket.\n\n869\n00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,925\nAnd it's money well spent, so\nit's a great product, really,\n\n870\n00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:01,147\nreally useful stuff in there.\n\n871\n00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:08,168\nJust to put it in perspective,\nMicrosoft has a similar product,\n\n872\n00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:13,750\nit costs $1,400, so $1,400 versus $80,\nit's a big difference.\n\n873\n00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:19,150\nSome of the other things,\nremote Apple events.\n\n874\n00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,090\nThis is one of the most\nmisunderstood ones.\n\n875\n00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:24,380\nRemote Apple events is actually\nsomething that ties in with Automator.\n\n876\n00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:28,990\nWith Automator we can run programs and\nperform actions on our own machine.\n\n877\n00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,050\nBut Automator can\nactually run programs and\n\n878\n00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:34,260\nperform actions on remote machines also.\n\n879\n00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,090\nIf we want that to happen, if we want to\nrun Automator scripts on one machine and\n\n880\n00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:43,630\nhave it perform actions on our machine,\nwe need to turn on remote Apple events.\n\n881\n00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,300\nThat's what enables the Automator\nto be able to connect.\n\n882\n00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,900\nAnd then we need to specify what\naccounts are allowed to do that.\n\n883\n00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,210\nYou can set it to all users,\n\n884\n00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,850\nthen any user that has an account on\nthis machine will be able to do it.\n\n885\n00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:57,705\nOr, we could limit that down to\nparticular users if we want.\n\n886\n00:43:57,705 --> 00:43:58,580\nIt's pretty neat stuff.\n\n887\n00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:05,360\nThe last one is one that I probably use\nthe least, and that is Internet sharing.\n\n888\n00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,490\nLet's say that you've got a cable modem,\nand\n\n889\n00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:11,760\nthe cable modem plugs directly into\nyour Mac, so you've got Internet access.\n\n890\n00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,350\nBut you've got another computer in your\noffice that you wanna give Internet\n\n891\n00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,600\naccess to also.\n\n892\n00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,190\nBut you don't have a router.\n\n893\n00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,350\nWhat you can do is you can\nuse your Mac as a router.\n\n894\n00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:22,190\nYou can turn it into a router.\n\n895\n00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,790\nPeople's network communications\ncan pass through your Mac\n\n896\n00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,420\nto go out to the Internet.\n\n897\n00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,680\nMost people don't need that\nanymore because home routers and\n\n898\n00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,900\noffice routers have become so inexpensive.\n\n899\n00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,380\nBut back in the day routers\nwere pretty expensive and\n\n900\n00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,100\nusing your machine as a router was a low\ncost alternative for that, all right?\n\n901\n00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:39,580\nSo, we can turn on Internet Sharing.\n\n902\n00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:43,496\nNow, the recommendation is that you\nhave two network adapters for this,\n\n903\n00:44:43,496 --> 00:44:47,320\none network adapter connected to\nthe Internet, and another network adapter\n\n904\n00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,320\nconnected to your internal network\nwhere your clients are, right?\n\n905\n00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,720\nYou can use the same adaptor for both.\n\n906\n00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,250\nSee like, if I turn on Internet Sharing,\nactually,\n\n907\n00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,960\nit's not gonna let me turn it on, is it?\n\n908\n00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,450\nSee how it says, I cannot start Internet\nsharing because I have not selected a port\n\n909\n00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,770\nto share my connection.\n\n910\n00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:07,480\nWhat you have to pick is, which\nconnection is connected to the Internet?\n\n911\n00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,440\nSo I'm sharing my Internet connection.\n\n912\n00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,150\nWell, I've just got ethernet,\nso I'll choose that.\n\n913\n00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,180\nAnd then I can say I wanna\nshare it to computers using and\n\n914\n00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,970\nhere I normally pick my other adapter,\nright?\n\n915\n00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:18,750\nI just have one.\n\n916\n00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,090\nI could choose the same adapter.\n\n917\n00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:23,380\nThe problem, and\nit's gonna give me a warning there,\n\n918\n00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,830\nif I do sharing on the same port\nyou get some really weird behavior.\n\n919\n00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:27,995\nA lot of stuff doesn't work right.\n\n920\n00:45:27,995 --> 00:45:29,133\nAnd it can cause some problems.\n\n921\n00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:31,550\nApple doesn't recommend it, all right?\n\n922\n00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:34,440\nSo instead I really need to\nhave a second adapter here.\n\n923\n00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,610\nWhere you can have some real fun\nwith this is maybe you have one\n\n924\n00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:41,398\nof those cellular cards for your laptop so\nyou have cellular data service.\n\n925\n00:45:41,398 --> 00:45:43,531\nAnd you wanna share that with other\nlaptops if you're on the road.\n\n926\n00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:48,550\nWell you could choose the cellular\ncard as your Internet connection,\n\n927\n00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:53,158\nand then choose your wireless\ncard as the internal connection.\n\n928\n00:45:53,158 --> 00:45:56,849\nIf you're doing an ad-hoc network,\nyou'd have people connect to you,\n\n929\n00:45:56,849 --> 00:45:59,120\nand they get access over\nyour cellular card.\n\n930\n00:45:59,120 --> 00:45:59,814\nYou can share that connection.\n\n931\n00:45:59,814 --> 00:46:03,911\nA lot of neat ways to use that, but\nit's not a very common feature, right?\n\n932\n00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:11,138\nIt's kind of like a Wi-Fi hotspot\nalmost when you use it that way.\n\n933\n00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:14,760\nAll right,\nI've turned on quite a bit of features.\n\n934\n00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,790\nActually, I guess I didn't turn on screen.\n\n935\n00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:19,390\nOh, notice how my screen\nsharing turned off?\n\n936\n00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:22,560\nAnd it's because I turned\non Apple Remote Desktop.\n\n937\n00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,160\nWhen Apple Remote Desktop is on it\ntakes over the screen sharing pieces,\n\n938\n00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,960\none of the features that it offers.\n\n939\n00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,423\nI'm gonna turn off\nthe Apple Remote Desktop piece.\n\n940\n00:46:30,423 --> 00:46:31,467\nThere we go.\n\n941\n00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:35,520\nSo that I can turn screen\nsharing back on just by itself.\n\n942\n00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,650\nAll right, so now I'm sharing quite\na few different services on my system.\n\n943\n00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,160\nAll right,\n\n944\n00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,790\nso what if I wanna get connected to\nthese services to see what's going on?\n\n945\n00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:48,300\nWell, I need to jump over to a client and\nconnect.\n\n946\n00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,670\nI just set up my server.\n\n947\n00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:53,340\nRight, this machine here\nis gonna act as my server.\n\n948\n00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,690\nNow I need to connect from a client.\n\n949\n00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:59,620\nWell, there's a few different ways\nwe can connect from a client.\n\n950\n00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,500\nThe easiest way is simply\nto use the finder.\n\n951\n00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,970\nIn the background we have what's\ncalled service discovery running.\n\n952\n00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:10,410\nApple service discovery is where it's\nscanning the network and looking for\n\n953\n00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,620\nservers that are providing services.\n\n954\n00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,780\nIt tries to automatically find them,\nright?\n\n955\n00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:19,520\nThis is a function of one of the neat\nprotocols that Apple built called Bonjour.\n\n956\n00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,450\nBonjour is a protocol that is designed for\nzero configuration.\n\n957\n00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,180\nWe don't have to assign IP addresses.\n\n958\n00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,530\nWe don't have to assign DNS servers,\nanything like that.\n\n959\n00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,960\nBonjour works automatically.\n\n960\n00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,880\nIt works using IPv6 link-local addresses.\n\n961\n00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,010\nWith IPv6, you've always got at\nleast one link-local address and\n\n962\n00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:42,170\nit enables you to talk to any other\ncomputer on your local network.\n\n963\n00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:46,625\nIt's perfect for service discovery and\nit even has a neat DNS function.\n\n964\n00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:51,141\nDNS is that domain naming system\nwhere we resolve a name to an IP.\n\n965\n00:47:51,141 --> 00:47:53,820\nWell, that normally\nrelies on a DNS server.\n\n966\n00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,620\nWe have to have a server available.\n\n967\n00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,097\nBut with Bonjour it doesn't\nwanna rely on that.\n\n968\n00:47:57,097 --> 00:48:02,064\nSo it uses something called multicast DNS\nor mDNS where we send out as multicast\n\n969\n00:48:02,064 --> 00:48:07,493\nmessage on the network that says, hey I'm\nlooking for a computer called Don Laptop.\n\n970\n00:48:07,493 --> 00:48:11,149\nAnd all the other computers that\nare out there are listening on that\n\n971\n00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:14,609\nmulticast address And\nDon laptop hears it and responds back and\n\n972\n00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:19,140\nsays, yep that's me this is my IP\naddress that's my name here's my IP.\n\n973\n00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,405\nIt basically performs the DNS\nfunction without a name server.\n\n974\n00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:23,740\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n975\n00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:27,960\nEnables that connectivity\nwithout relying on a DNS server.\n\n976\n00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,485\nSo my system without doing any crazy\nconfigurations is already running Bonjour,\n\n977\n00:48:32,485 --> 00:48:37,060\nit's already doing service discovery and\nit's already using multi cast DNS\n\n978\n00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:41,800\nto be able to resolve names to IP's,\nI'm really good to go.\n\n979\n00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,870\nSo I set up that server.\n\n980\n00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,930\nThe only thing I have to do with my client\nis to make sure I'm on the same network.\n\n981\n00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:50,210\nIf I'm out there on the internet, I'm\nnot gonna be able to discover my client.\n\n982\n00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,610\nThat's why we need iCloud.\n\n983\n00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:55,560\nBut if I'm on the same network,\nApple service discovery will find it.\n\n984\n00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,090\nThe Bonjour protocol will find it and\nI'll see those services.\n\n985\n00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,120\nWe'll see that in the finder.\n\n986\n00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,460\nSo here if I fire up my finder,\non the left side,\n\n987\n00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,200\nI have my favorites,\nwhich I think I have too many of.\n\n988\n00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,770\nBut if I scroll down, I'll find Shared.\n\n989\n00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:14,250\nAnd under the Shared section, here's where\nI'm seeing stuff that's on the network.\n\n990\n00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:18,390\nAnd if I look,\nI can see Don's Mac OS VM right there.\n\n991\n00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:22,480\nAnd if I click on it, I can see\nthe screen share that was set up for it.\n\n992\n00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,840\nSo it's got Don's Mac OS VM, and it's\ntrying to connect right now as a guest.\n\n993\n00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,060\nIt's trying to connect as a guest,\nan unauthenticated user and\n\n994\n00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,260\nshow me the resources that I get for it.\n\n995\n00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,270\nAnd unfortunately I'm not\ngetting much of anything.\n\n996\n00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:40,650\nWhen you connect as a guest, well, you'd\nhave to have everyone's permission set on\n\n997\n00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,730\nthe other side, and\nI turned that off for most of them.\n\n998\n00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,230\nI didn't have everyone set up.\n\n999\n00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:48,190\nSo, instead I need to hit\nthis Connect As button,\n\n1000\n00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,940\nto tell it that I'm gonna\nconnect as a different user.\n\n1001\n00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,700\nAnd so I'll choose Connect As, and\n\n1002\n00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:57,480\nI'm gonna provide the name of\nmy account on the other side.\n\n1003\n00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,540\nSo on this laptop I'm D Pezete, but\n\n1004\n00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,720\non my virtual machine I just did\nDon Pezete written out like this.\n\n1005\n00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,000\nSo I'm gonna punch that in and\nI'll tell it to remember my password.\n\n1006\n00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,510\nGo ahead and remember it so I don't\nhave to punch this in again next time.\n\n1007\n00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,110\nNow I'll go ahead and connect and\n\n1008\n00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:15,430\nthis time it's gonna reach out to\nthat machine with valid credentials.\n\n1009\n00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,560\nAnd I should see some more stuff now.\n\n1010\n00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,690\nWell, I would see more stuff\nif I knew my own password.\n\n1011\n00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:25,200\nI'm gonna use the Unix\nversion of my username.\n\n1012\n00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,460\nThat might help it.\n\n1013\n00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,880\nJust give that a shot and\nsee if I can get connected.\n\n1014\n00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,870\nThere we go!\n\n1015\n00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:31,330\nAll right, so now I'm connected up.\n\n1016\n00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,340\nAnd once I connected what do I see?\n\n1017\n00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,030\nDon Pezet's public folder.\n\n1018\n00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:39,100\nIf you have file sharing turned on, at\na minimum you'll see that public folder.\n\n1019\n00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,930\nI also see shared documents.\n\n1020\n00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:45,790\nThat was the folder I created inside\nof my documents folder earlier.\n\n1021\n00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:50,360\nSo for example if I,\nlet me whip up some new document or,\n\n1022\n00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:55,120\nlet me just go into another\nFinder window here.\n\n1023\n00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:55,990\nI'll grab a show note.\n\n1024\n00:50:57,056 --> 00:51:02,400\nLet me take this little test file, and\nI'll go over here and drop it right in.\n\n1025\n00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,788\nSo I just dropped that into\nthis Shared Documents.\n\n1026\n00:51:04,788 --> 00:51:07,920\nIf I jump back over to my client,\nI mean, to my server.\n\n1027\n00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,700\nIf I go into the Finder, and\ninto My Documents, there's that\n\n1028\n00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:16,050\nShared Documents folder that I created,\nand there's that dontest.md, right?\n\n1029\n00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:16,550\nCopied right in.\n\n1030\n00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,640\nI can do share screen to connect to\nthe screen and view that machine.\n\n1031\n00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,900\nI can look at the hard drive, and\nbrowse through the hard drive,\n\n1032\n00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,130\nbecause I'm a valid user that\nhas access to that system.\n\n1033\n00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:31,610\nAnd I can browse into my home folder, and\nhave access to my various other resources.\n\n1034\n00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:37,250\nNow, while I'm doing this,\nyou guys might have noticed on my desktop\n\n1035\n00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,440\nthere's a bunch of icons\nthat keep appearing.\n\n1036\n00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:47,010\nWhen you browse the network resources,\nyour Mac is mounting those resources.\n\n1037\n00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:49,090\nWe're mounting them so\nthey'll be available for access and\n\n1038\n00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:51,180\nthey just show up as\nthese remote hard drives.\n\n1039\n00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,840\nNow they don't actually show\nup on the desktop by default.\n\n1040\n00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,670\nThat's a feature I've turned\non because I like to have it.\n\n1041\n00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:02,120\nIf you want that functionality, in the\nFinder, just go to Finder > Preferences.\n\n1042\n00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,020\nIn your Preferences,\n\n1043\n00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:09,470\nif you go to the General Tab, you'll\nsee show these items on the desktop.\n\n1044\n00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:13,750\nAnd I've turned on connected servers,\nthat's not on by default.\n\n1045\n00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:16,270\nI've turned that on and\nthat's why all those icons are showing up.\n\n1046\n00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,460\nIf I turn that off,\nsee how they all just disappeared?\n\n1047\n00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,230\nSo I like to have that, personally.\n\n1048\n00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:21,290\nSame thing with hard disks.\n\n1049\n00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:22,430\nI like to have that.\n\n1050\n00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,200\nBut that would be off by default too.\n\n1051\n00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,860\nSo I've kinda turned each of those on.\n\n1052\n00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:29,520\nAll right so those are mounted.\n\n1053\n00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,760\nThey're right there and I now have access.\n\n1054\n00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,810\nIf I close out of the Finder,\nthey're still mounted.\n\n1055\n00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:35,930\nI still have access.\n\n1056\n00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,820\nIf I want to get into shared documents\nI can just double-click on it.\n\n1057\n00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,670\nAnd I'm in there and\nI can start to work on it.\n\n1058\n00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:41,870\nMakes it kinda easy and convenient.\n\n1059\n00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,460\nWhen they're mounted,\nthey're mounted under the volumes folder.\n\n1060\n00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:51,870\nSo if I were to go into terminal,\nand go into /volumes.\n\n1061\n00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:55,610\nSo that's my path, /volumes.\n\n1062\n00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:59,380\nAnd if I pull up a directory listing, see\nhow I've got Don Pezet's public folder,\n\n1063\n00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,610\nshared documents, Don Pezet.\n\n1064\n00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:05,197\nThose are the different ones that are\nshowing up for me because I've browsed to\n\n1065\n00:53:05,197 --> 00:53:08,421\nthose, and they're mounted in here\nvia that network connectivity.\n\n1066\n00:53:11,951 --> 00:53:14,570\nWhen I'm done with them,\nI can unmount them.\n\n1067\n00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:16,010\nI can disconnect them.\n\n1068\n00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:19,010\nAnd you can disconnect them just\nlike any other external drive.\n\n1069\n00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:23,250\nSo as we browse to them,\nif I was still in that browse screen.\n\n1070\n00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:28,480\nSo if I go back to Don Mac OS VM,\nI see each of those drives in here.\n\n1071\n00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,050\nAnd you've got a little\neject button beside it.\n\n1072\n00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:34,730\nAnd if I press that I can eject all of\nthe disks at once, or I can pick and\n\n1073\n00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:36,110\nchoose amongst them.\n\n1074\n00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:37,730\nOr I can always do them one by one.\n\n1075\n00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:42,860\nI can just drag and drop one down\nto my trash and throw it away.\n\n1076\n00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,870\nAnd that's gonna unmount it that way.\n\n1077\n00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,160\nBut I'll use this button here so\nwe can nail them all at once.\n\n1078\n00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,970\nYou see how they all just went away.\n\n1079\n00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:51,800\nAnd they're gone, right.\n\n1080\n00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,010\nPretty simple process,\nnot anything too terribly crazy.\n\n1081\n00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:58,120\nBut service discovery is what\nis powering all of that.\n\n1082\n00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,740\nAnd if I want to reconnect,\nI can just double click it.\n\n1083\n00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,710\nThere is another way we can connect to\nthose network resources that I want to\n\n1084\n00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:06,450\nshow you, it's a neat little\nshortcut tool that we have,\n\n1085\n00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,360\nit's one that I use all the time.\n\n1086\n00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,120\nBut looking at the clock,\nI'm a little low on time on this segment.\n\n1087\n00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,970\nSo let's pause here and take a break, and\n\n1088\n00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:14,770\nwhen we get back I wanna\nshow you that other tool.\n\n1089\n00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:17,580\nAnd then we'll take a look at a couple\nof other neat features before we\n\n1090\n00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,370\nwrap the show up.\n\n1091\n00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:20,613\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n1092\n00:54:20,613 --> 00:54:26,766\n[MUSIC]\n\n1093\n00:54:26,766 --> 00:54:28,520\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n1094\n00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,370\nSo, in the last segment, I showed the\neasiest way to connect to network shares,\n\n1095\n00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:36,020\nor easiest in my opinion, which was just\nto go into the Finder and in the Shared\n\n1096\n00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,700\nsection in the Finder we could browse\nthe network and find everything.\n\n1097\n00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,460\nThat works, right?\n\n1098\n00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:45,620\nIt works assuming you're on the same\nnetwork as the remote system.\n\n1099\n00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,790\nBut what if you wanna connect to a system\nthat's not on the same network as you?\n\n1100\n00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:52,390\nSo for example here in our\nstudio we actually have four or\n\n1101\n00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,530\nfive different networks here.\n\n1102\n00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,830\nSo when I run my finder,\n\n1103\n00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,070\nI'm seeing the other computers that\nare here in the studio with me.\n\n1104\n00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:03,230\nBut I'm not seeing the other computers\nhere in the building, and if I wanna\n\n1105\n00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:07,850\nconnect to one of those, I'm gonna need\nto provide a different way to connect.\n\n1106\n00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:11,350\nAnd for\nthat we have the connect to server menu.\n\n1107\n00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:14,020\nThe connect to server menu\nis a part of the Finder.\n\n1108\n00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,980\nWhen you're in the Finder it lets you\nbrowse around the stuff that's found,\n\n1109\n00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:21,660\nthus the name it can do\nthat easy right from here.\n\n1110\n00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,130\nBut if you go up into the menu,\nyou have a Go menu.\n\n1111\n00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:28,070\nAnd if you bring down Go,\nyou'll see various places that you can\n\n1112\n00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:30,880\ngo like to your network,\niCloud drive, and so on.\n\n1113\n00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,820\nAnd down at the bottom,\nyou've got connect to server, right?\n\n1114\n00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:39,590\nConnect to server will let you specify\na server that you want to connect to, and\n\n1115\n00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:42,210\nyou can see where I've connected\nto all sorts of different systems.\n\n1116\n00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:46,330\nAnd these are an easy way to\nreach out to systems that\n\n1117\n00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:49,065\naren't necessarily on\nthe same network as you.\n\n1118\n00:55:49,065 --> 00:55:52,330\nYou're in a different location\nthan we can jump out to.\n\n1119\n00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:55,495\nNow, when we connect to some\nkind of a remote system,\n\n1120\n00:55:55,495 --> 00:55:58,395\nwhat we need to do is provide a protocol.\n\n1121\n00:55:59,885 --> 00:56:02,470\nSo from here we have to type the protocol,\nand we need to know the protocol name.\n\n1122\n00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:04,873\nNow normally we're connecting\nto file shares, right?\n\n1123\n00:56:04,873 --> 00:56:07,938\nWhen you connect to a file share,\nif it's on a Mac.\n\n1124\n00:56:07,938 --> 00:56:11,548\nYou're gonna connect with\nthe Apple File Protocol or AFP.\n\n1125\n00:56:11,548 --> 00:56:19,089\nSo you'll see here I've\ntyped in AFP://10.1.230.5.\n\n1126\n00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:24,060\nWe have a little Mac mini over here off\nset that's connected to a storage device\n\n1127\n00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:26,420\nand it's where we store all\nof our video recordings.\n\n1128\n00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,630\nAnd if I wanna browse that,\nthis is what I connect to.\n\n1129\n00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:31,940\nI use Apple File Protocol\nto connect that Mac mini.\n\n1130\n00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:35,870\nIf I want to connect to a Windows machine,\nif there's a Windows file share out there,\n\n1131\n00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:41,090\nWindows machines don't use AFP,\nthey use Server Message Block or SMB.\n\n1132\n00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:42,530\nAnd so I would type in SMB:// and\n\n1133\n00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:46,990\nthe IP of the system that\nI'm connected to, right?\n\n1134\n00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,930\nAnd you'll see where I've\ndone that right here.\n\n1135\n00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:54,300\nThis is SMB://10.10.1.222/dropbox.\n\n1136\n00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:59,000\nThat means I was using server message\nblock to connect to a Windows machine.\n\n1137\n00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,350\nThe Windows machine was 10.10.1.222, and\n\n1138\n00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:06,170\nthe folder I was connecting to was\nthe shared folder called Dropbox.\n\n1139\n00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:08,390\nThat's the machine that\nI was connecting to.\n\n1140\n00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:12,490\nNow with SMB, that's a Windows box,\nthey connect, it works pretty well.\n\n1141\n00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:15,800\nWIth AFP, there's a few things\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n1142\n00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,950\nThe Apple File Protocol has changed\na little bit over the years.\n\n1143\n00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:25,310\nWhen you run Yosemite, and really\nMavericks too, the default version of\n\n1144\n00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:30,380\nAFP is 3.4, so we're up to\nApple File Protocol version 3.4.\n\n1145\n00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:36,710\nWell Time Machine was\nintroduced back in AFP 3.1.\n\n1146\n00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:40,630\nSo this was back in a while ago, so\n\n1147\n00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:46,809\nthis AFP 3.1 if I remember\nright was in OS 10.2.\n\n1148\n00:57:46,809 --> 00:57:48,260\nShoot!\n\n1149\n00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,570\nI'll make sure to nail that version\nnumber down for the show notes so\n\n1150\n00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:51,310\nyou have the exact number.\n\n1151\n00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:56,040\nI'm pretty certain it was 10.2 that\nran AFP 3.1 for the first time.\n\n1152\n00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,940\nNow, AFP 3.1 had full support for\nwhat was called File Forking.\n\n1153\n00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,380\nFile Forking is what we're\ndoing with Time Machine.\n\n1154\n00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,840\nYou have different versions of a file.\n\n1155\n00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:10,120\nAs you change a file, it saves\nthe original version and it saves a Fork.\n\n1156\n00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,260\nLike a fork in the road.\n\n1157\n00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:11,780\nRight?\nSo\n\n1158\n00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:15,050\nhere's the original file,\nhere's the changed file branching off.\n\n1159\n00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:20,180\nPrior to AFP 3.1,\nwe didn't have support for that.\n\n1160\n00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,150\nSo be aware of that,\n\n1161\n00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:26,390\nthat if you're connecting to a system\nthat's running a really old Mac OS\n\n1162\n00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:31,010\nlike 10.1 or earlier, they're\nprobably running AFP 3.0 or earlier.\n\n1163\n00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:34,640\nAnd as a result, Time Machine isn't\ngonna work very well on those things.\n\n1164\n00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,790\nThe auto save feature is not gonna work.\n\n1165\n00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,831\nAll that stuff is dependent\non our newer file systems.\n\n1166\n00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:41,655\nNow, 10.2 is really old.\n\n1167\n00:58:41,655 --> 00:58:43,320\n10.6 is really old.\n\n1168\n00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,600\nSo I don't think anybody's\ngonna have that problem.\n\n1169\n00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,450\nBut it is something that\nturns up on the exam so\n\n1170\n00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:49,860\njust be aware that AFP 3.1 and higher.\n\n1171\n00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:53,190\nThat's what we really want.\n\n1172\n00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:55,980\nSo if we're gonna connect to\nan Apple server or a client or\n\n1173\n00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:01,220\nwhatever, it's AFP://, the IP address\nof the system, and then the folder.\n\n1174\n00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,440\nIf we don't specify a folder,\n\n1175\n00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,770\nlike I'm doing here, AFP://,\nand just an IP address.\n\n1176\n00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:10,410\nWhen you hit Connect, it's gonna\nreach out and ask you what folder.\n\n1177\n00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:13,100\nSo here's a list of all\nthe folders that are on that one.\n\n1178\n00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,280\nWell, we store all of our shows\nhere in this Edutainment folder, so\n\n1179\n00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,030\nI can choose that, and I can hit OK,\nand it's gonna connect up, and\n\n1180\n00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,590\nI can jump in here and\nI can see all this junk.\n\n1181\n00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,090\nApparently we have a lot of stuff in here.\n\n1182\n00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:25,850\nSo I can see all of this stuff,\nand browse in there, and\n\n1183\n00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:28,180\nfind all of our content and whatever.\n\n1184\n00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,530\nSo I just connected via the network.\n\n1185\n00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:31,680\nIt mounted it.\n\n1186\n00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,050\nI see it here on my desktop.\n\n1187\n00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:36,350\nI'm not connected to it and\nI can access that resource as needed.\n\n1188\n00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:40,400\nNow if you're gonna be connecting\nfrequently, if this is something you're\n\n1189\n00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,910\ngonna use over and over again,\nyou can save it to your favorites.\n\n1190\n00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:47,900\nWhen I went to Go > Connect To Server,\nnotice all these down here.\n\n1191\n00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,450\nThey're labelled as Favorite Servers.\n\n1192\n00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:51,470\nIf I type in something and\n\n1193\n00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:55,940\nI just use it once,\nthen it'll be gone the next time I reboot.\n\n1194\n00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,540\nBut if I want to use it every time I can\ntype it in here and I can hit the little\n\n1195\n00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:01,740\nplus symbol and that'll add it to\nthis list, and now it's a favorite.\n\n1196\n01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:07,560\nOne that I can get to over and over\nagain as I need to, and it'll be there.\n\n1197\n01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:12,100\nNow AFP and SMB, those are the two most\ncommon protocols we're gonna use here.\n\n1198\n01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,000\nBut there's a few others that we can do.\n\n1199\n01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,880\nThere's NFS, that's the Network\nFile System, it's used for Unix and\n\n1200\n01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,910\nLinux systems.\n\n1201\n01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:24,015\nSo we could type NFS://\nthe server name/the export name,\n\n1202\n01:00:24,015 --> 01:00:26,480\nwhich is basically a folder.\n\n1203\n01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,000\nWe can do, let's see,\nAFP, SMB, NFS, SFTP, for\n\n1204\n01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,130\nsecure file transfer protocol,\nas well as regular FTP.\n\n1205\n01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,645\nSo you can type in either one of those,\n\n1206\n01:00:36,645 --> 01:00:41,220\nftp:// and then the IP address/folder and\nconnect to it up there.\n\n1207\n01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:45,850\nSo a few different protocols we\ncan use to get connected with.\n\n1208\n01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,562\nThe other one worth mentioning is WebDAV,\n\n1209\n01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:52,850\nwhich is Web-based distributed\nauthoring and versioning.\n\n1210\n01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,944\nIt's used by some systems\nlike Microsoft SharePoint,\n\n1211\n01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:58,730\nlike web-based content\nmanagement platforms.\n\n1212\n01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:04,960\nYou can point to a URL so it would\nactually be HTTPS:// and a webpage.\n\n1213\n01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,371\nAnd when you connect with certain\ncredentials, it allows you to edit that\n\n1214\n01:01:08,371 --> 01:01:11,420\nweb page as if it was just\na shared folder on your system.\n\n1215\n01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,530\nIt's pretty neat.\n\n1216\n01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:16,290\nI've never actually used it in production\nI've used it in tests and so on, but\n\n1217\n01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:17,500\nit is something that's out there.\n\n1218\n01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:22,440\nAnd then another one,\nwhich is not really file sharing, is VNC.\n\n1219\n01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,970\nI mention how the screen sharing in Mac OS\nuses virtual network computing, VNC.\n\n1220\n01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:30,440\nWell it's got a VNC client built into it.\n\n1221\n01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,010\nSo if you had a machine running\nVNC that you wanted to connect to,\n\n1222\n01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:35,950\nyou could type VNC://.\n\n1223\n01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:38,690\nAnd then the IP address of that machine.\n\n1224\n01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:43,920\nIf you had a special port, you can provide\nit, like :5900 and then connect up.\n\n1225\n01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,490\nIt'll prompt you for a password, but it'll\nconnect up and you'll see that screen.\n\n1226\n01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:50,950\nSo, a lot of different protocols\nthat we have available right here\n\n1227\n01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:51,770\nfrom connect to server.\n\n1228\n01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,670\nOnce we're connected, we can work\nwith the machine and off we go.\n\n1229\n01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,640\nAnd if you use it a lot,\nadd it to your favorites.\n\n1230\n01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,820\nAdd it to favorites and\nyou'll have it down in there.\n\n1231\n01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,120\nSo for example, I've got this machine,\n\n1232\n01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,610\nuser VMC machine I've\nsaved to my favorites.\n\n1233\n01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:05,270\nAnd I can try and connect it.\n\n1234\n01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:06,010\nI just double clicked on it.\n\n1235\n01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:09,030\nI don't actually know if that machine is\nturned on right now, so we'll have to see.\n\n1236\n01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:12,450\nThis is a little machine that\nwas running our chat room.\n\n1237\n01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,030\nI don't think it's actually running.\n\n1238\n01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,420\nYeah, so it's not gonna connect.\n\n1239\n01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:17,030\nBut it'll reach out and try and connect.\n\n1240\n01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:20,740\nIt'll prompt me for a password if I\ndon't have one, and it'll get connected.\n\n1241\n01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:22,850\nAnd you can save your\npasswords to the keychain,\n\n1242\n01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:24,700\nand then you don't have to\nprovide them every time.\n\n1243\n01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,710\nMakes it easy to bring these\nback up at a moments notice.\n\n1244\n01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:30,320\nAll right.\n\n1245\n01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,870\nSo those are some of the different\nways to get connected.\n\n1246\n01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:38,250\nWe use the finder in the sidebar\nthere as well as the Go To or\n\n1247\n01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,040\nGo and then connect to server menu.\n\n1248\n01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:44,670\nAll right, let's see what else do we\nhave on our agenda for this episode.\n\n1249\n01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:47,400\nLet's see, already talked about that.\n\n1250\n01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,050\nOh, this is an important one.\n\n1251\n01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:53,500\nSo far, every time I've tried\nto connect between my machines,\n\n1252\n01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,400\nit's worked out pretty well.\n\n1253\n01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:58,100\nBut what if it doesn't work out very well?\n\n1254\n01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,060\nWhat if I try and connect to a remote\nshare and I just can't connect?\n\n1255\n01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:03,812\nWell, like this VNC connection here\nthat I'm waiting on it's not actually\n\n1256\n01:03:03,812 --> 01:03:04,490\nconnecting.\n\n1257\n01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:06,700\nAnd finally it says connection failed.\n\n1258\n01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:10,770\nWell, I know that that machine is turned\noff and that's why I can't connect to it.\n\n1259\n01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:12,370\nBut, what if I didn't know that?\n\n1260\n01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:15,400\nWhat if I didn't know why can't\nI connect to that machine?\n\n1261\n01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:20,180\nWell, I could start to troubleshoot and\ntry and figure it out.\n\n1262\n01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:23,220\nOne thing that I absolutely need to verify\n\n1263\n01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:26,740\nis whether the Mac OS\nfirewall has been turned on.\n\n1264\n01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,430\nMac OS is a very secure operating system.\n\n1265\n01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:33,410\nApple has taken a lot of time to make\nsure that everything is secured and\n\n1266\n01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:36,030\nit's only running the services\nthat it absolutely needs.\n\n1267\n01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:36,762\nIt's not wasteful.\n\n1268\n01:03:36,762 --> 01:03:38,990\nBut you might wanna go a step further.\n\n1269\n01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:44,040\nYou might wanna go a step further and\nlock things down even more,\n\n1270\n01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:48,020\nand it's got a firewall built into\nit that's turned off by default.\n\n1271\n01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:48,548\nBut you can turn it on.\n\n1272\n01:03:48,548 --> 01:03:52,482\nAnd when you turn it on, you control what\nconnections are allowed to come in, what\n\n1273\n01:03:52,482 --> 01:03:56,317\npackets are able to come into your system\nand packets that are allowed to go out.\n\n1274\n01:03:56,317 --> 01:03:59,051\nThe firewall gives you\ncontrol of your network.\n\n1275\n01:03:59,051 --> 01:04:00,752\nSo if you turn that on.\n\n1276\n01:04:00,752 --> 01:04:03,881\nYou might be blocking some\nof the sharing connectivity.\n\n1277\n01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:07,722\nI might not be able to view and\nsee in that machine over there because,\n\n1278\n01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:11,740\nmaybe it is turned on but\nmaybe its firewall is blocking me.\n\n1279\n01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:14,120\nSo let's take a look at that\nfirewall configuration.\n\n1280\n01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:18,440\nI mentioned that it is turned off by\ndefault, but it's really easy to set up.\n\n1281\n01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:23,560\nIf we take a look at a machine, this guy.\n\n1282\n01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,552\nI'm gonna go into its system preferences.\n\n1283\n01:04:27,545 --> 01:04:30,684\nAnd in the system preferences\nif you go to security and\n\n1284\n01:04:30,684 --> 01:04:33,840\nprivacy, you'll see a tab\nup top labeled firewall.\n\n1285\n01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:37,410\nAnd as I go to firewall,\nsee my firewall is turned off.\n\n1286\n01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,940\nI got a little gray light beside it,\nI'm not running the firewall.\n\n1287\n01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:42,320\nI'm gonna turn it on.\n\n1288\n01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,210\nSo, i'll hit my little lock.\n\n1289\n01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,690\nI'll authenticate as an administrator.\n\n1290\n01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:48,130\nAnd now I can turn it on.\n\n1291\n01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:53,210\nWhen I turn on the firewall,\nit puts in a basic rule,\n\n1292\n01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:56,830\nthat says no incoming traffic is allowed.\n\n1293\n01:04:56,830 --> 01:05:01,590\nUnless it's replying to traffic that\nwe sent out in the first place.\n\n1294\n01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:06,470\nSo if I send out a question like,\nhey can I have a copy of CNN's web page?\n\n1295\n01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:11,500\nI'll allow the reply, here is a copy\nof the web page to come back in.\n\n1296\n01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:15,390\nBut if CNN tries to send me their web\npage on their own, I'm gonna block it.\n\n1297\n01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:17,480\nIncoming traffic is blocked.\n\n1298\n01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:21,100\nIf we've turned on iCloud, it's smart\nenough to allow the iCloud services to\n\n1299\n01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,940\npass through so it will enable those.\n\n1300\n01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:29,500\nAnd from now on, as I load software and\nstart to run it, it will prompt me and\n\n1301\n01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:34,950\nsay, do you want to allow this software\nto accept connections on the network?\n\n1302\n01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:39,920\nSo as I install more software and do more\nthings, it will prompt me about that.\n\n1303\n01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,520\nBut you can control it yourself.\n\n1304\n01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,020\nIf you go into these firewall options.\n\n1305\n01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,270\nYou get the advanced configurations and\n\n1306\n01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:51,030\nsee how it's already allowing\nthe sharing that I set up.\n\n1307\n01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,700\nSo it's already allowing the DVD sharing,\nthe file sharing,\n\n1308\n01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,560\nbecause it assumes if I turn those on I\nprobably won't allow those to come in.\n\n1309\n01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:01,620\nBut we can add our other software in here\nto say I want to allow this software\n\n1310\n01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:02,430\nto receive connection.\n\n1311\n01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,520\nSo for example,\nmaybe I've got some of those,\n\n1312\n01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,290\nI don't know if they make them anymore,\nthe Air Tunes speakers.\n\n1313\n01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:12,580\nThey were the speakers that would\nconnect over the network to your iTunes\n\n1314\n01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,770\ninstallation and play your music right\nthrough speakers without a stereo.\n\n1315\n01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:17,870\nSo if I've got those,\n\n1316\n01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:20,780\nI might want to allow those speakers\nto be able to connect into iTunes.\n\n1317\n01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:23,160\nSo I would need to add\niTunes to this list.\n\n1318\n01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,520\nI'll hit my little plus symbol,\nI'll find iTunes.\n\n1319\n01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,270\nIf I can stop scrolling [LAUGH] so far.\n\n1320\n01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:31,620\nI'm going a little scroll crazy.\n\n1321\n01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,360\nThere we go.\nI'll choose iTunes.\n\n1322\n01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,600\nI'll add that to the list.\n\n1323\n01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,090\nAnd see how it separates it with a line?\n\n1324\n01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:39,060\nThe ones above the line,\n\n1325\n01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,980\nthose are the ones that were created\nby the operating system automatically.\n\n1326\n01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:44,760\nThe ones below the line\nare the ones that we created.\n\n1327\n01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,650\nAnd then we can specify whether\nwe allow incoming connections or\n\n1328\n01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:50,370\nblock incoming connections.\n\n1329\n01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:53,420\nMaybe I have software that I\nabsolutely do not want to be able to\n\n1330\n01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,560\ncommunicate on the network.\n\n1331\n01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,320\nSo I can choose to block\nthose connections and\n\n1332\n01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,890\nnow that software is\nonly able to run locally.\n\n1333\n01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,630\nYou can do that, but\nI'll leave it as allow.\n\n1334\n01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:04,460\nAnd now when I fire up those air tune\nspeakers and they start looking for\n\n1335\n01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:06,820\nmy iTunes install,\nthey'll see it and connect.\n\n1336\n01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:09,680\nI'm not sure if they still\nmake those speakers or not.\n\n1337\n01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:10,230\nThey're pretty neat.\n\n1338\n01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,000\nThere are some advanced features\nthat can be turned on here.\n\n1339\n01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,440\nMost people won't need to bother with, but\n\n1340\n01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,780\nthey're kind of neat,\nlike enable cell phone.\n\n1341\n01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:22,990\nBy default your mac will\nrespond to things like pings.\n\n1342\n01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:26,560\nIf somebody sends a ping across\nthe network, your mac will respond to it.\n\n1343\n01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:30,350\nNow, that's useful for troubleshooting,\nwe like to have ping turned on for that.\n\n1344\n01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:31,860\nBut, it's also useful for\n\n1345\n01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:34,880\nattackers who are trying to find out\nwhat computers are on the network.\n\n1346\n01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,500\nSo, you can turn on stealth mode.\n\n1347\n01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,840\nAnd basically it says do not\nrespond to any attempts for\n\n1348\n01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,210\npeople to connect with ICMP for\npings and trace routes.\n\n1349\n01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,890\nLet me show you this in action.\n\n1350\n01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:50,934\nIf I fire up my terminal and\nI ping, let's see, what was that?\n\n1351\n01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:53,880\n211.55.6 I believe was its IP.\n\n1352\n01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,280\nThere we go, yep.\n\n1353\n01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,670\nSo I'm pinging that virtual machine.\n\n1354\n01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:59,210\nThe ping is running through just fine.\n\n1355\n01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:01,760\nIt's responding back saying yes, I'm here.\n\n1356\n01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,840\nBut if I don't want that,\n\n1357\n01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:06,850\nif I want to be invisible on the network,\nI can go into stealth mode.\n\n1358\n01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:08,960\nI'll turn on that stealth mode, hit OK.\n\n1359\n01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,740\nSo now I'm in stealth mode.\n\n1360\n01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:16,070\nAnd if I go back here,\nsee how the pings just stopped?\n\n1361\n01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,900\nThat Mac is now invisible.\n\n1362\n01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:22,300\nWhen that Mac sends communications out,\nthe replies will be allowed to come back\n\n1363\n01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:25,650\nin, but\notherwise it's not responding to these.\n\n1364\n01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:29,310\nNow it's not completely invisible\nbecause I've got Bonjour running.\n\n1365\n01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:31,100\nSo Bonjour discovery is still gonna work.\n\n1366\n01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,340\nAll the service discovery,\nthat still works.\n\n1367\n01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,220\nPeople will find my shared folders and\nso on.\n\n1368\n01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,720\nBut that's stuff that I've allowed.\n\n1369\n01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,350\nIf you wanna be truly invisible you've\ngotta shut off all that file sharing.\n\n1370\n01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:41,450\nTurn all that stuff off.\n\n1371\n01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,900\nTurn off the iCloud functionality.\n\n1372\n01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,090\nAnd now you are invisible.\n\n1373\n01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:48,080\nNow when you send a request\nout you'll get replies but\n\n1374\n01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,380\nnobody will even see you\nto send messages to you.\n\n1375\n01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,360\nIt's useful if you're somewhere\nlike Starbuck's, right.\n\n1376\n01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:55,790\nYou don't want all that access\navailable on a public network.\n\n1377\n01:08:58,110 --> 01:09:00,550\nBut that can also be part of the problem.\n\n1378\n01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:03,020\nIf you're not able to connect to\na shared folder on somebody's system,\n\n1379\n01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:06,760\nif you're not even able to see it,\nthey might have turned on the firewall and\n\n1380\n01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,220\nthey might have moved\nthemselves into stealth mode,\n\n1381\n01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:12,810\nor turned off some of these\nsettings in the firewall.\n\n1382\n01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:15,460\nThey might not be allowing\nfile sharing to pass through,\n\n1383\n01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:17,560\nthey might not be allowing\nthat functionality.\n\n1384\n01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:18,320\nAnd that can be a problem.\n\n1385\n01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:22,900\nThere's also this automatically\nallow signed software to receive\n\n1386\n01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:23,670\nincoming connections.\n\n1387\n01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:27,840\nIf we install software\nthat's digitally signed,\n\n1388\n01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:32,050\nlike from the App Store, then it will\nautomatically be allowed into the firewall\n\n1389\n01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:33,880\nto be able to receive\nthose communications.\n\n1390\n01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:36,920\nAnd again, I may or may not want that.\n\n1391\n01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,850\nIf it's from the App Store it's probably\nsafe, it's probably okay to allow it.\n\n1392\n01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:41,710\nBut I said probably more\nthan once in that sentence.\n\n1393\n01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:44,680\nSo if you don't like that you can\nturn it off, and now you're saying,\n\n1394\n01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,310\nI don't care if it's signed or not.\n\n1395\n01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:49,449\nI wanna manually add it to the list\nif I want it, otherwise, don't.\n\n1396\n01:09:51,936 --> 01:09:55,740\nThe other option is to block\nall incoming connections.\n\n1397\n01:09:55,740 --> 01:10:00,340\nThat effectively shuts down any inbound\nconnections, including Bonjour,\n\n1398\n01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:02,110\nincluding all the various things.\n\n1399\n01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:06,120\nThat are available on the system,\nyou now become basically shut down.\n\n1400\n01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:10,100\nYou can still send outbound\ncommunications, but inbound communications\n\n1401\n01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:14,310\nare not gonna be allowed, and\nsome protocols will no longer function.\n\n1402\n01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:17,860\nProtocols that do port switching,\nlike FTP, where it starts on one port and\n\n1403\n01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:19,850\njumps to another, that's broken.\n\n1404\n01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:23,650\nMost VPN tunnels will be broken,\nbut general web access, email,\n\n1405\n01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:27,120\nthat stuff will work still even though\nwe blocked incoming connections.\n\n1406\n01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,530\nYou send out your outbound messages,\n\n1407\n01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:31,730\nthey come back in on the same ports,\nand it works.\n\n1408\n01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:34,220\nSo interesting type of setup there.\n\n1409\n01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,780\nNot something that most\nof us are gonna use, and\n\n1410\n01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,950\nthat can really break things\nif we're not careful.\n\n1411\n01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:43,990\nAll right so that's one of the things\nthat we want to check when we're\n\n1412\n01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:44,760\ntroubleshooting.\n\n1413\n01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:48,630\nIf we can't see the machine on\nthe network then we can't connect to it.\n\n1414\n01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:50,948\nAnd if the firewall is on\nthat might be the reason.\n\n1415\n01:10:50,948 --> 01:10:55,076\nSo we might need to add our little\nservices to that firewall list to\n\n1416\n01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:56,680\nallow it.\n\n1417\n01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,540\nAfter that, there's some other\ntroubleshooting steps you might wanna do.\n\n1418\n01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,790\nWe should probably test\nour network connectivity.\n\n1419\n01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,480\nCan I not get to this one machine?\n\n1420\n01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,570\nOr can I not get to any machine?\n\n1421\n01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:07,790\nMaybe it's not just this\nmachine that's the problem.\n\n1422\n01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:09,710\nMaybe I've got some bigger network outage.\n\n1423\n01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:12,080\nSo I need to verify the network\nis actually functioning.\n\n1424\n01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:17,470\nAnd one of the ways I like to do that is\nI call it testing from the inside out.\n\n1425\n01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:21,040\nIf we want to test one of the tools\nI like to use is ping, and\n\n1426\n01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:25,050\nnormally I would use the network utility,\nI can go into the network utility and\n\n1427\n01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:28,210\nI can go to ping, and\nI can specify different hosts here.\n\n1428\n01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:32,970\nWell, I guess I could use it, I just\ncan't zoom-in in the network utility.\n\n1429\n01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:35,910\nBut I start by pinging myself.\n\n1430\n01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:39,770\nIf you ping yourself, you have\nwhat's called a loop back address.\n\n1431\n01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:46,315\nThe address is just your computer by\nitself and if you ping it's 127.0.0.1.\n\n1432\n01:11:46,315 --> 01:11:50,085\nThis ping does not use your\nnetwork adaptors at all.\n\n1433\n01:11:50,085 --> 01:11:51,536\nIt just uses software on your computer.\n\n1434\n01:11:51,536 --> 01:11:57,161\nSo when you ping 127.0.0.1,\nyou're testing your TCPIP software.\n\n1435\n01:11:57,161 --> 01:12:03,255\nIf you get responses, Then you know your\nsoftware is working properly, right?\n\n1436\n01:12:03,255 --> 01:12:09,300\nThat it's not like a corrupt OS, let me\njust shrink that down to like four pings.\n\n1437\n01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:13,910\nAll right assuming that works,\nthen I need to ping my IP address,\n\n1438\n01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:17,970\nmy actual IP address, whatever IP\naddress I'm assigned on this computer.\n\n1439\n01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:21,890\nIf I go into system preferences,\nand network, and\n\n1440\n01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:26,200\nI choose my I'm on WiFi right now so\nif I choose my WiFi adapter and\n\n1441\n01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,710\nI look I can see that I'm 10.1.230.241.\n\n1442\n01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:34,860\nIf I ping that IP,\nthat's pinging myself also but\n\n1443\n01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:38,570\nunlike the loop back this\nwill use my network adapter\n\n1444\n01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:42,530\nthis is actually gonna hit the network\nadapter's driver before it comes back and\n\n1445\n01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:47,680\nresponds to me so if this doesn't work I\nprobably have some kind of driver issue,\n\n1446\n01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:51,320\nbut it works so I'm good there.\n\n1447\n01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:55,610\nThen, I need to try and\nping another computer on my network.\n\n1448\n01:12:55,610 --> 01:13:02,460\nI might try and ping 10.1.230.5, another\ncomputer on my network that I know is on.\n\n1449\n01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,880\nLet's see if I can ping it.\n\n1450\n01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,700\nAll right.\n\n1451\n01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:08,340\nIf I can, that verifies that\nmy network cable is good,\n\n1452\n01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,590\nthat I am talking on the network.\n\n1453\n01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:12,970\nThat other machine is up so\nwe're good there but\n\n1454\n01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:17,120\nif I can't get to that machine,\nis it a problem with just that machine?\n\n1455\n01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,530\nOr is it a problem with me?\n\n1456\n01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:19,040\nAll right.\n\n1457\n01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:19,850\nI don't know.\n\n1458\n01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:21,800\nI should try ping another\nmachine on the network.\n\n1459\n01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,180\nMaybe my firewall, or router or\nwhatever and see if I can get to that.\n\n1460\n01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:29,380\nAnd if I can get to that, the net usually\nmeans I've got good network connectivity.\n\n1461\n01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:34,220\nI was trying to connect to .4 earlier, and\nI said I thought it might be powered off.\n\n1462\n01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:38,080\nIf I try and ping it,\nI can see I'm not even able to ping it.\n\n1463\n01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,050\nSo it more than likely\nis actually turned off.\n\n1464\n01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,320\nI'd need to go and look, right in.\n\n1465\n01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,540\nAnd there's no substitute for\ngoing and looking, and\n\n1466\n01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:45,180\nseeing if there is a little\ngreen light on it.\n\n1467\n01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,740\nBut, yeah, my ping is not\ngetting through on that one.\n\n1468\n01:13:48,952 --> 01:13:51,340\nAll right, once I've established\nthat I can ping to the firewall,\n\n1469\n01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:53,280\nthat tells me the firewall is up.\n\n1470\n01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,330\nCan I get through it?\n\n1471\n01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:58,700\nCan I get out to the Internet, so\nI can ping somebody out on the Internet?\n\n1472\n01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,030\nI'll ping one of Google's DNS servers.\n\n1473\n01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:04,540\nIf I can ping that,\nI'm good all the way out to the Internet,\n\n1474\n01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:08,050\nthere's likely not a network\nissue on my own computer.\n\n1475\n01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:12,680\nIf I still can't connect,\nto whoever it is I'm trying to connect to,\n\n1476\n01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:16,120\nit's probably not an issue on my machine,\nit's probably an issue on their's.\n\n1477\n01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:16,750\nAll right.\n\n1478\n01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,750\nAnd firewalls are normally\nthe number one culprit.\n\n1479\n01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:22,670\nA good way to test the firewall is\nright here in the network utility,\n\n1480\n01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:25,030\nwe have a port scan utility.\n\n1481\n01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:29,288\nIf I'm connecting to a FTP server,\nit uses ports 20 and 21.\n\n1482\n01:14:29,288 --> 01:14:31,996\nIf I'm connecting to a SSA server,\nit uses 22.\n\n1483\n01:14:31,996 --> 01:14:34,621\nIf I'm connecting to VNC,\nit uses port 5900.\n\n1484\n01:14:34,621 --> 01:14:38,230\nThere's all sorts of port numbers\nthat are associated with protocols.\n\n1485\n01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:42,410\nAnd when we run the port scanner,\nit will scan that machine And\n\n1486\n01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:44,480\nlist the ports that were open.\n\n1487\n01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,060\nRight?\nThe ones that were available for\n\n1488\n01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,480\nme to connect to.\n\n1489\n01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,810\nAnd so,\nif I'm trying to connect via SMB, or\n\n1490\n01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:54,370\nAFP, Apple File Protocol,\nthere's ports associated with that.\n\n1491\n01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:55,560\nAnd I can see whether they're open.\n\n1492\n01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,480\nAnd if they aren't,\nthen I've got a firewall issue.\n\n1493\n01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,390\nOr the service is just not turned on.\n\n1494\n01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:02,100\nMaybe they didn't actually\nshare the folders out.\n\n1495\n01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:04,480\nMaybe I'm looking at the wrong IP address.\n\n1496\n01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,720\nBut this is the way that we can test it.\n\n1497\n01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:10,620\nIf I were to take that\ncomputer at 10.1.230.5 and\n\n1498\n01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:12,880\nscan it, it'll show me the open port.\n\n1499\n01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:18,040\nNow, the scan can take a while,\nbecause there's 65,535 ports.\n\n1500\n01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,100\nWell, technically there's 65,536 ports.\n\n1501\n01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,420\nIt takes a while to scan those.\n\n1502\n01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:25,330\nWe might want to put a limit in.\n\n1503\n01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:29,038\nThe most important ports\nare between one and 1,024.\n\n1504\n01:15:29,038 --> 01:15:30,600\nThose are called registered ports.\n\n1505\n01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:34,800\nThings like HTTP and HTTPS,\nyour email protocols,\n\n1506\n01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,210\nFTP, all those guys are in-between\nthese two port ranges.\n\n1507\n01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:42,455\nBut there are some other ones that\nare out there like VNC at port 5,900.\n\n1508\n01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:44,180\nSo there are some others\nthat are outliers.\n\n1509\n01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:46,830\nBut most of the good stuff is\nright there in that range.\n\n1510\n01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:50,860\nI'm gonna scan this IP just looking\nat that range to see what's there.\n\n1511\n01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,080\nAnd I see I got a message back.\n\n1512\n01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,622\nAnd I don't have to have the port numbers\nmemorized cuz it tells me the protocol.\n\n1513\n01:15:55,622 --> 01:15:57,080\nPort 21, FTP.\n\n1514\n01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:02,205\nPort 22, SSH, Port 88,\n[INAUDIBLE] Port 111, some RPC.\n\n1515\n01:16:02,205 --> 01:16:07,115\nI'm starting to get these different\nmessages back and I can see right here,\n\n1516\n01:16:07,115 --> 01:16:09,580\n548 Apple file protocol over TCP.\n\n1517\n01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:12,600\nSo, I should be able to connect\nto file shares on this system.\n\n1518\n01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:17,450\nIf I didn't get 548 back, I probably won't\nbe able to connect to Apple file share.\n\n1519\n01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:20,150\nIt's ether not turned on, or\nthe firewall's blocking it.\n\n1520\n01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:23,120\nI need to go and look into that to find\nout whether or not that's functioning.\n\n1521\n01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:26,390\nI see a couple of other ones.\n\n1522\n01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:28,920\nGarcon, which is part of Bonjour.\n\n1523\n01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:33,830\nA few others that aren't named,\nlike port 1,017, 1,021.\n\n1524\n01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:37,030\nI'm actually not sure what those are so\nI'd need to go and look those up.\n\n1525\n01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:43,425\nAnd there may be even more that I just\ndidn't scan because I stopped it at 1,024.\n\n1526\n01:16:43,425 --> 01:16:47,975\nI could go and run a bigger full scan to\nscan all of its ports that are available\n\n1527\n01:16:47,975 --> 01:16:49,505\nand see what we get back.\n\n1528\n01:16:49,505 --> 01:16:51,105\nI'll start that and let it run.\n\n1529\n01:16:51,105 --> 01:16:53,685\nBut this is a great way to see\nif it is a firewall issue or\n\n1530\n01:16:53,685 --> 01:16:56,265\nsome other kind of connectivity issue.\n\n1531\n01:16:56,265 --> 01:16:58,295\nTroubleshooting can be pretty challenging,\n\n1532\n01:16:58,295 --> 01:16:59,715\nbecause you don't really\nknow what the problem is.\n\n1533\n01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,660\nRight?\nYou've gotta test things out.\n\n1534\n01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:06,230\nPinging from the inside out,\nlet's you determine where the failure is.\n\n1535\n01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:08,570\nAnd then the port scan utility,\n\n1536\n01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:11,440\ncan let you see the actual connections\nthat are being made on that other end.\n\n1537\n01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:16,160\nGood ways to test right there,\neasy processes.\n\n1538\n01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,460\nIt does require a little bit of\nknowledge there as far as what some of\n\n1539\n01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:19,520\nthese things do.\n\n1540\n01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,050\nBut Apple tries to make it easy.\n\n1541\n01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:27,050\nAll right, so that's about it for\nthe network file services.\n\n1542\n01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:28,520\nI'm trying to think if\nthere's anything else.\n\n1543\n01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,050\nWhen, well I think I did mention that.\n\n1544\n01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:32,750\nI was gonna say the host\nnames are a machine, but\n\n1545\n01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,360\nI showed that in the sharing panel.\n\n1546\n01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,430\nIt's a pretty straight\nforward as far as things go.\n\n1547\n01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:40,860\nRemember for the exam,\nthey want you to be familiar with iCloud.\n\n1548\n01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:43,830\nThat's the big network service,\nthe one Apple is proud of.\n\n1549\n01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:46,910\nThe easiest, and most feature rich.\n\n1550\n01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:50,240\nBut then they want you to know the file\nservice on the individual machines.\n\n1551\n01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:54,410\nThe things like sharing folders, and\nsharing printers, that kind of stuff.\n\n1552\n01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:57,720\nIt's right there,\neasy to turn on and get in business.\n\n1553\n01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:02,000\nNow one thing I didn't\ntalk about was OSX Server.\n\n1554\n01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,720\nThe OSX Server app adds\neven more services.\n\n1555\n01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,080\nBut it's not on the ACSP exam.\n\n1556\n01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,274\nYou actually see that\none on the ACTC exams so\n\n1557\n01:18:10,274 --> 01:18:12,360\nwe'll see that on the next series.\n\n1558\n01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:16,038\nBut for right now, those\nare the services we need to be aware of.\n\n1559\n01:18:16,038 --> 01:18:19,020\nAll right well that's a good spot for\nus to wrap this show up.\n\n1560\n01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,790\nLet me

00:00:38,720\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,330\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,080\nback again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n6\n00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,910\nWe're starting to wind things down now\nas we move into the final objective\n\n7\n00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,580\narea inside of this exam as we take\na look at managing our system.\n\n8\n00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,870\nIn this episode, what we're going to is we\nare gonna focus in on peripheral devices.\n\n9\n00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,900\nWhen you buy a Mac,\nApple kind of has an idea\n\n10\n00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,330\nof what is the most common set of hardware\nthat a regular user's going to need.\n\n11\n00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,560\nAnd so when you buy that MacBook or\nthat iMac or that Mac Mini,\n\n12\n00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,860\nit's already got the basic components\nin there that you're going to need.\n\n13\n00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,230\nIt's got a hard drive for storage,\nand it might be a magnetic drive or\n\n14\n00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,030\nit might be solid state, but\nit's got storage of some sort.\n\n15\n00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,910\nIt's got memory.\n\n16\n00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,030\nIt's got a video card.\n\n17\n00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,500\nIt's got network cards.\n\n18\n00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,420\nIt might have a physical\ncopper-based plug-in network card or\n\n19\n00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,700\nit might have a wireless card or\nit might have both.\n\n20\n00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,830\nIt might have Bluetooth.\n\n21\n00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:35,240\nIt might have various other things that\nApple assumes the general user will need.\n\n22\n00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,880\nBut the problem is,\nnot everybody is a general user.\n\n23\n00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,250\nDifferent people have different needs, and\n\n24\n00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,960\nso all of the Apple devices sold\ntoday are designed to be expandable.\n\n25\n00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,040\nWell, I say all of them.\n\n26\n00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,280\nMaybe not the iPhones and iPads.\n\n27\n00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,110\nThose are pretty well locked down.\n\n28\n00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,230\nBut as far as your MacBooks,\nyour Mac Pros and\n\n29\n00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,470\nyour Mac Minis,\nthey're designed to be expandable.\n\n30\n00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,180\nNow in the old days when we bought\na computer, if it was expandable, right?\n\n31\n00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,340\nIf you remember the old G4 Macs and those\nthings, they were these big desktops and\n\n32\n00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,840\nyou could pop open the side and you could\nadd cards and add hard drives inside them,\n\n33\n00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,240\nand you could do that without\nvoiding your warranty.\n\n34\n00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,720\nBut on these newer devices, like my laptop\nhere, it's not designed to be opened.\n\n35\n00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,220\nI can't crack this thing open and\nadd hardware to it.\n\n36\n00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,720\nOr if you buy one of those new Mac Pros\nwhere it's shaped like a trash can\n\n37\n00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,670\nyou're not supposed to open those.\n\n38\n00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,250\nThere's no room to add\nthings inside of it.\n\n39\n00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,890\nSo how do we expand our Mac?\n\n40\n00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,580\nHow do we add more to it\nto get it to do more stuff?\n\n41\n00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,040\nWe do it through some of the expansion\nbuses that are included on your device.\n\n42\n00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,840\nThe most common one of those is USB,\nbut we've got other ways, too.\n\n43\n00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,210\nFireWire, Thunderbolt,\n\n44\n00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,460\nBluetooth, all these different ways of\nattaching devices to your computer.\n\n45\n00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,130\nNow when I say attaching devices,\nwhat am I talking about here?\n\n46\n00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,500\nWell, it can be a range of things.\n\n47\n00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,000\nRight here,\njust looking at my laptop on the show,\n\n48\n00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,390\nI've got a couple of cables\nsticking out of my laptop.\n\n49\n00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,080\nI've got a Thunderbolt cable, over on\nmy left side, which is a network jack.\n\n50\n00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,890\nSo I've got a physical network\ncable running into Thunderbolt.\n\n51\n00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,930\nOn the right side of my computer, I've\ngot a little USB dongle that's adding my\n\n52\n00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,375\ntrackball, because I'm not a big\nfan of touchpads, so I've got this\n\n53\n00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:17,230\ntrackball that I use throughout the show,\nand that's connected in via USB.\n\n54\n00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,330\nI've got an HDMI cable in here,\nwhich is how I'm sharing my screen.\n\n55\n00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,140\nYou guys are actually seeing\nthe HDMI output of my laptop when\n\n56\n00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,460\nwe share that screen out.\n\n57\n00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,480\nSo these are things that\nI've added on to the system.\n\n58\n00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,700\nThey didn't come with it.\n\n59\n00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,840\nIt didn't come with a trackball.\n\n60\n00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,930\nIt didn't come with\nan external adapter like this.\n\n61\n00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,420\nI had to add those on to it to be\nable to get that functionality.\n\n62\n00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,440\nThose are peripherals, and\nperipherals can be far,\n\n63\n00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,110\nfar more things than that,\nright, based on your needs.\n\n64\n00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,570\nJust as an example,\nlet's go to Apple's website here.\n\n65\n00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,230\nSo if I fire up Apple's website and\n\n66\n00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,500\ngo into the Apple Store,\nyou'll see where we can buy Macs,\n\n67\n00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,090\niPhones, iPads, and all the way on\nthe right here we've got Shop Accessories.\n\n68\n00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,530\nThese accessories are peripherals,\nthings we can add on.\n\n69\n00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,713\nSo here's the goPro cameras,\nthe AirPort wireless,\n\n70\n00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,460\nthen they've got bags and stuff,\nthat doesn't really count.\n\n71\n00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:15,020\nBut you'll see other things in here\nlike charging devices and fitness and\n\n72\n00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,070\nsports stuff we can add on.\n\n73\n00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,270\nMemory, some devices are still able to be\nopened and you can add memory into them.\n\n74\n00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,030\nFor example, the Mac Minis that\nwere made up until this year,\n\n75\n00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,500\nyou could add more RAM into\nthem if you wanted to.\n\n76\n00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,890\nThe newer Mac Minis,\nthe memory is soldered in.\n\n77\n00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,090\nYou can't upgrade it anymore.\n\n78\n00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,950\nSo some of them have add-ons there.\n\n79\n00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,230\nWe've got Mice & Keyboards,\na lot of people use mice and keyboards.\n\n80\n00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,740\nBut then there's Music Creation,\nso what's that all about?\n\n81\n00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,270\nWell, I don't create music.\n\n82\n00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,770\nIt's not something I do.\n\n83\n00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,320\nI have very, very little musical talent.\n\n84\n00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,480\nActually that's probably\na lie right there.\n\n85\n00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,720\nI have absolutely no\nmusical talent whatsoever.\n\n86\n00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,290\nSo I have no interest in that.\n\n87\n00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,260\nSo what's under Music Creation is probably\nnot anything that I'm ever going to use.\n\n88\n00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,840\nBut there's other people out there,\nthat are DJs or producers or\n\n89\n00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,970\nwhatever, and\nthey need high-quality microphones.\n\n90\n00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,560\nThey need guitar input.\n\n91\n00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,170\nThey have a guitar they want to be able\nto feed that right into their Mac so\n\n92\n00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,120\nthey can record with Garage Band and\ndo multi-track recording.\n\n93\n00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,440\nThey need that.\n\n94\n00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,000\nYour average user doesn't.\n\n95\n00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,110\nSo Apple would be wasting money to put\nthat in every single laptop they sold\n\n96\n00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,390\nwhen just a small fraction\nof the people need it.\n\n97\n00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,540\nSo instead, they leave it up\nto peripheral manufacturers.\n\n98\n00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,140\nNotice this one says JAM.\n\n99\n00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,670\nIt's from a company called Apogee.\n\n100\n00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,350\nThis is not actually made by Apple.\n\n101\n00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,880\nA company has made this to fill a need and\nApple supports that, in this scenario.\n\n102\n00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,200\nThey don't always support it,\nbut in this scenario they do.\n\n103\n00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,980\nSo if you need to plug\na guitar into your laptop or\n\n104\n00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,470\ninto your Mac Pro,\nyou can't do it right out of the box, but\n\n105\n00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,190\nyou can add a peripheral and\nnow you get that functionality.\n\n106\n00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,020\nAnd you'll see there's all\nsorts of specialized hardware,\n\n107\n00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,320\nlike here's a MIDI keyboard that runs.\n\n108\n00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,250\nSome of this stuff, I actually,\n\n109\n00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,750\nlike I don't necessarily even know what\nthis thing is, some USB recording device.\n\n110\n00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,500\nSo a lot of this stuff is\nreally specialized and\n\n111\n00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,350\ngoes beyond what a normal person\nmight even understand what it is.\n\n112\n00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,950\nBut it's important to somebody.\n\n113\n00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,790\nI have no idea what an IK Multimedia\niKlip Xpand Mini holder is.\n\n114\n00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,800\nI don't know, but somebody needs that.\n\n115\n00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,310\nIt adds on to their laptop and\nit adds that functionality.\n\n116\n00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,450\nThose are peripherals.\n\n117\n00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,070\nReally common ones, let's think of\none of the most common peripherals.\n\n118\n00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,590\nWell, keyboard and mouse,\nthat's gotta be number one and number two.\n\n119\n00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,400\nKeyboard and mouse are really,\nreally common.\n\n120\n00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,940\nIt used to be that webcams and\nmicrophones were really common.\n\n121\n00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,320\nBut most computers these\ndays have them built in.\n\n122\n00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,310\nIt's like my laptop has a webcam and\na microphone built into it, so\n\n123\n00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,990\nI don't really need to add that on.\n\n124\n00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,880\nIn the old days that was something\nan average user didn't need, and\n\n125\n00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,790\nso it was a separate device that you'd\nbuy and you'd add on to your system.\n\n126\n00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,649\nBut now thanks to things like FaceTime,\nthe average user does need a webcam and\n\n127\n00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:52,350\na microphone, so\nApple has included it in the device.\n\n128\n00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,030\nThat happens over time,\nthis stuff changes.\n\n129\n00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,940\nOther really common ones, a printer.\n\n130\n00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,420\nIf you want to print, you might\nhave a printer on your network or\n\n131\n00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,570\nyou might have a printer\nattached to your laptop or\n\n132\n00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,897\ndesktop somehow, via one of\nthe different connection mediums.\n\n133\n00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,620\nOther devices we might connect,\nnetwork adapters, those are pretty common.\n\n134\n00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,550\nI'm using them right here.\n\n135\n00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,220\nWhat else?\n\n136\n00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,650\nWhat else makes for\na good peripheral device you might add on?\n\n137\n00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,150\nStorage.\n\n138\n00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:21,350\nIt's getting kind of sad the amount of\nexternal hard drives that I have and\n\n139\n00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,990\nUSB keys that I have.\n\n140\n00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,690\nI eat up a lot of storage.\n\n141\n00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,110\nIf you're gonna do Time Machine and you\nwanna back up to an external hard drive,\n\n142\n00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,580\nthat external hard drive is\na peripheral that we attach.\n\n143\n00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,310\nWe're adding more storage to our\nsystem without having to open it up,\n\n144\n00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,940\nwithout having to void our warranty.\n\n145\n00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,260\nIt's really nice that\nwe're able to do that.\n\n146\n00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,990\nThose are some of the things\nthat are peripheral devices.\n\n147\n00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,500\nNow the problem with\nperipheral devices is that\n\n148\n00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,730\nwhen you add it onto your computer, it's\nsomething that your Mac didn't expect.\n\n149\n00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,028\nWhen Apple made your Mac at the factory,\nwhen they put Mac OS on there,\n\n150\n00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:56,251\nthey knew what hardware\nthey were selling you.\n\n151\n00:07:56,251 --> 00:08:00,694\nWhen they sold me this laptop, They knew\nexactly what hardware was in there, and so\n\n152\n00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:04,990\nMac OS is designed to handle a 100% of\nthe hardware that's in this laptop.\n\n153\n00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,400\nI didn't have to do anything special.\n\n154\n00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,730\nIt just worked right out of the box,\nand that was that.\n\n155\n00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,230\nBut if I start adding peripheral devices,\nlike this trackball,\n\n156\n00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,390\nwhen I added this trackball to my laptop,\nApple didn't know about that.\n\n157\n00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,500\nMy trackball's made by Logitech.\n\n158\n00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,000\nAnd so\nthe Mac has to look at that and say,\n\n159\n00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,720\nall right, do I know what that device is?\n\n160\n00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,020\nCan I handle it?\n\n161\n00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,410\nAnd it makes a guess.\n\n162\n00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,140\nAnd it says well, it looks like a mouse,\nI'm gonna treat it like a mouse.\n\n163\n00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,850\nAnd that's what happened.\n\n164\n00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,700\nWhen I first plugged in this trackball,\nit treated it like a mouse, and it worked.\n\n165\n00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,630\nMy track ball was able to move the mouse\naround on the screen, and the left and\n\n166\n00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,640\nright mouse buttons would click,\nand that worked great.\n\n167\n00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,600\nBut, my track ball has\nsome extra buttons on it.\n\n168\n00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,690\nIt's got a back and a forward\nbutton on it to be able to, like,\n\n169\n00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,440\nif you're browsing the web you can go a\nweb page, forward a web page if you want.\n\n170\n00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,750\nIt's got a scroll wheel on it that\ncan move the web page up and down.\n\n171\n00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,510\nAnd when I first put the mouse in,\nthose actually didn't work.\n\n172\n00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:00,620\nThat was additional functionality\nthat the Mac didn't know about.\n\n173\n00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,990\nIt didn't know about those special\nbuttons that were on the track ball.\n\n174\n00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,980\nWhat I had to do then\nwas to load a driver.\n\n175\n00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,550\nDrivers are extra software that we add\n\n176\n00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,480\non to our Mac that allows them to\ninteract with specialized hardware.\n\n177\n00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,180\nNow Apple is one of the best companies,\nfor\n\n178\n00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,700\nmaking drivers not an issue for\nus, all right.\n\n179\n00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,500\nAt Apple headquarters, they know what\nare really common devices out there and\n\n180\n00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,990\nthey write native Apple drive Drivers\nthat are included with Mac OS, and so\n\n181\n00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,460\na lot of times if you go out and\nyou buy hardware that's really common, and\n\n182\n00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,610\nyou plug it in, your Mac will\nrecognize it and set it up and\n\n183\n00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,730\nrun and\nyou don't have to add a driver at all.\n\n184\n00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,960\nIt just knows it and works with it.\n\n185\n00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,180\nBut if you plug in your device and\nit doesn't work, or parts of it work and\n\n186\n00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,750\nparts of it don't, well, when that\nhappens, you may need to load a driver.\n\n187\n00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,310\nAll right.\n\n188\n00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,350\nAn example of this might be a printer.\n\n189\n00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,270\nThat you go to attach\na printer to your Mac.\n\n190\n00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,140\nAnd the Mac sees it,\nit shows up as a printer.\n\n191\n00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,400\nBut, some of the features are missing.\n\n192\n00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,670\nWe have an office copier here,\nit's this massive printer.\n\n193\n00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,180\nAnd it can do all sorts of crazy things\nlike it can print on large paper and\n\n194\n00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,180\nfold it in half to booklets, it can\nstaple things, it can hole punch things,\n\n195\n00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,400\nright, it's a really fancy printer.\n\n196\n00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,410\nIf I load the default Mac driver,\nI can print out that big printer but\n\n197\n00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,780\nI can't hole punch and I can't staple.\n\n198\n00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,010\nIt doesn't see that advanced functionality\nuntil I load the driver, from the vendor.\n\n199\n00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,910\nNow, when we add drivers to our software,\nwe attach them into Mac OS,\n\n200\n00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,030\nthat teaches the operating system\nabout that advanced functionality.\n\n201\n00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,410\nHow to properly talk to the hardware.\n\n202\n00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,800\nIt's not us talking to the hardware,\nit's Mac OS talking to the hardware.\n\n203\n00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,630\nWe're teaching Mac OS how to\nto talk to those devices.\n\n204\n00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:49,630\nAnd we do that through the user drivers,\nand drivers can come in one of three ways.\n\n205\n00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,490\nThere's actually three different\nways we get drivers on this system.\n\n206\n00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,060\nThe most common way is you\ngo to the vendor's website,\n\n207\n00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,450\nyou download a driver\npackage right from them.\n\n208\n00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,910\nAnd it will be a PKG file, right?\n\n209\n00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,400\nNormally when you download an application\nfrom the web, it's an app, right?\n\n210\n00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,300\nAnd we just drag it and drop it right\ninto our applications folder and\n\n211\n00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,360\nnow it's an application we can run, but\n\n212\n00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,240\na driver needs to be available to\nthe operating system underneath.\n\n213\n00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,210\nIt's not an app that we run on demand.\n\n214\n00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,890\nIt's something that's running\nin the background on the system.\n\n215\n00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,220\nAnd so\nit'll come to use as a package file.\n\n216\n00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,190\nAnd when you run that package file.\n\n217\n00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,470\nit will copy the driver contents,\nto the hard drive.\n\n218\n00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,230\nIt will copy them into your library so\nthat they're available, and\n\n219\n00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,670\nyou'll be able to access those\nresources as you need to.\n\n220\n00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,410\nUnder the hood in Mac OS, we have\nwhat's called the BSD operating system.\n\n221\n00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,950\nBSD is based on Unix.\n\n222\n00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,660\nIt's a Unix-like operating system.\n\n223\n00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,051\nAnd the heart of that Unix like operating\nsystem, is something called the kernel.\n\n224\n00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:50,560\nRight?\nK-E-R-N-E-L, so the kernel.\n\n225\n00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,340\nThe kernel is what's actually managing,\n\n226\n00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,930\nall of that interaction between our\noperating system and the hardware.\n\n227\n00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,320\nWhen we load a driver,\n\n228\n00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,940\nwe're actually teaching that kernel\nhow to interact with the hardware.\n\n229\n00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,960\nThose drivers,\nare called kernel extensions.\n\n230\n00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,550\nRight?\nA kernel extension.\n\n231\n00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,550\nAnd you'll hear people call\nthem different things.\n\n232\n00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,500\nthe official name from Apple,\nthey just call them extensions.\n\n233\n00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,880\nIn Unix land,\nwe call them kernel extensions.\n\n234\n00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,540\nBut you'll hear a lot of people\nrefer to them as Kext, and\n\n235\n00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,610\nI hate saying that,\nI think it sounds stupid.\n\n236\n00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,730\nBut I call them kext, and\nthat's because the file,\n\n237\n00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,530\nthat we loaded onto the hard drive,\nit'll actually end in dot K-E-X-T.\n\n238\n00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,450\nKernel extension,\ninstead of saying kext like that.\n\n239\n00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,530\nI think it sounds dumb.\n\n240\n00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,090\nBut, that's basically what's\nhappening when we load a driver.\n\n241\n00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:40,900\nNow, your operating system already\nhas some drivers built into it and\n\n242\n00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,970\nwe can see those right?\n\n243\n00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,800\nLet me just take this machine, so\nI've got this machine it's a stock in\n\n244\n00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,750\nsolid Yosemite I haven't\ndone anything to it.\n\n245\n00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,950\nActually I did the updates.\n\n246\n00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,950\nThere were some updates in\nthe app store so I did those but\n\n247\n00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,620\notherwise this is just a stock install and\nif I fire up my terminal,\n\n248\n00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,470\nwe can take a look at the extensions\nthat come with the system.\n\n249\n00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:08,290\nNow, remember like with the library, how\nthere is a library located in /Library,\n\n250\n00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,951\nand there's another library\nlocated in /System/Library.\n\n251\n00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:16,058\n/System/Library, that's the stuff\nthat comes with the operating system.\n\n252\n00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:19,340\nAnd then /Library,\nthat's the stuff that we load.\n\n253\n00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:25,385\nWell Kernel extensions of the same way\nthey can reside in more than one place,\n\n254\n00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:30,593\nthe ones that come with the system,\nthe ones that come from Apple,\n\n255\n00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:33,953\nare in /System/ Library/Extensions.\n\n256\n00:13:33,953 --> 00:13:38,713\nAll right, so that's the path that I'm in,\nand if I take a look at what's in here,\n\n257\n00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:42,113\nI'll see a bunch of files, and\nsee how they end in dot kext,\n\n258\n00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,980\nthose are those kernel extensions or\nkext files.\n\n259\n00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,490\nThese are the extensions,\nthat have been added on.\n\n260\n00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,190\nAnd these are the ones that came with,\nmy operating system, with MAC OS.\n\n261\n00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,560\nI didn't add these.\n\n262\n00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,120\nIf you look down the list, you'll see\nall sorts of crazy stuff in here.\n\n263\n00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:04,490\nNow some of this stuff,\nlike this guy right here, GeForce.kext.\n\n264\n00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,580\nThat's a kernel extension for\nNvidia video cards.\n\n265\n00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,470\nMy laptop doesn't have an Nvidia card.\n\n266\n00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,790\nWhen you buy these laptops, so\nif I go to, the Apple Store again.\n\n267\n00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,550\nAnd let's go shopping.\n\n268\n00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,200\nOkay?\nEverybody likes to go shopping.\n\n269\n00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,470\nAnd I'm gonna shop for a MacBook.\n\n270\n00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,040\nLet's see if I can still buy this laptop.\n\n271\n00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,050\nThey've probably replaced\nit with a new one by now.\n\n272\n00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,690\nI wanna buy a Mac.\n\n273\n00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,000\nAnd I want it to be a MacBook Pro.\n\n274\n00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,690\nAnd it looks like I'm still\non the current model.\n\n275\n00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,190\nThat's exciting.\n\n276\n00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,280\nI'm not out-of-date yet.\n\n277\n00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,750\nBut if you look I've got a 13 inch\nMacBook Pro with Retina display.\n\n278\n00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,020\nThat's what I'm running\nright here on the show.\n\n279\n00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,040\nAll right.\nThere's three different models of it and\n\n280\n00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,610\nif you look at the different models,\n\n281\n00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,610\nsee how it says\nIntel Iris Graphics right there?\n\n282\n00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,570\nAnd Intel Iris Graphics,\nIntel Iris Graphics.\n\n283\n00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,350\nAll three versions of the laptop I'm on,\ncome with an Intel Graphics Card.\n\n284\n00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,300\nBut, if I had stepped it up and\npaid a little extra money,\n\n285\n00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:07,610\nI could have got a 15 inch model, and\nyou can see here Intel Iris, but this one,\n\n286\n00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:13,260\nNVIDIA GeForce GT750M,\nthis one comes with a 3D graphics card.\n\n287\n00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,470\nIt's a little bit more expensive so\n\n288\n00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,040\nmy laptop costs, I think mine's\nprobably this middle one here.\n\n289\n00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,230\nI think I have more memory than that so\nI must have customized mine so\n\n290\n00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,200\nmine was probably around $1500.\n\n291\n00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,990\nThis one starts at $2500 so\nit's a lot more expensive but\n\n292\n00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,820\nyou get a fancy video card.\n\n293\n00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,540\nWell, if you want that fancy video card,\n\n294\n00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,720\nit's got a lot of extra 3D\nacceleration features in it.\n\n295\n00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,780\nMac OS needs to know about that.\n\n296\n00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,810\nAnd so, looking here in the kernel\nextensions, here it is.\n\n297\n00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,210\nHere's the kernel extension for\nthat GeForce card.\n\n298\n00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:49,330\nNow, why do I have that, if my laptop\ndoesn't have an Nvidia card in it?\n\n299\n00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,690\nWell, these kernel textensions\nare loaded on demand.\n\n300\n00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,500\nWhen your system boots up,\nit looks at the hardware you have.\n\n301\n00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,167\nAnd if the hardware is built into\nthe kernel which, not much of it is.\n\n302\n00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:05,042\nIf it's built into the kernel,\nit's already supported and that's that.\n\n303\n00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:08,625\nIf it's not built into the kernel,\nit looks for the kernel extension.\n\n304\n00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:12,543\nSo if it sees an Nvidia card,\nit looks for the kernel extension and\n\n305\n00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,290\nit loads it into RAM, and\nnow you're running it.\n\n306\n00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,246\nBut if it looks at your hardware and\nit doesn't see, and video card,\n\n307\n00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,167\nit doesn't load the extension.\n\n308\n00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:25,519\nSo just because the extension is here on\nmy hard drive doesn't mean I'm actually\n\n309\n00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,650\nrunning, right.\n\n310\n00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,680\nBut down the road,\nif I were to add an end video cartridge,\n\n311\n00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,250\nI can't do it on the laptop, but\nlet's just say I've soldered it on.\n\n312\n00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,280\nWell, it would see that card, and it would\nalready have the extension for it, and\n\n313\n00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,500\nit'd be in business, right?\n\n314\n00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,230\nThat's how these kernel extensions work.\n\n315\n00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,840\nThey're loaded on demand.\n\n316\n00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,960\nWhen your system recognizes the hardware,\nit looks for the extension and\n\n317\n00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,800\nif it's there, it loads the extension.\n\n318\n00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,140\nSo don't worry about having\nmore extensions than you need.\n\n319\n00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,110\nThey don't hurt performance\non your system.\n\n320\n00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,970\nCuz they're only loaded if you've\ngot the hardware that matches them.\n\n321\n00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,640\nAll right?\n\n322\n00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,020\nBut that's what these are, and\nyou see there's a bunch of them in here.\n\n323\n00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,510\nA lot of these are tied to\nthe Apple specific hardware, right,\n\n324\n00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,890\nthe hardware that Apple makes.\n\n325\n00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,415\nBut you'll see third party\ndrivers in here too.\n\n326\n00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:09,035\nLike these AMD and ATI video cards,\n\n327\n00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:12,635\nthose radeons,\nyou see those in a lot of Apple desktops.\n\n328\n00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:16,085\nIn the Apple laptops, I don't think they\ndo any AMD cards in the laptops now.\n\n329\n00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:20,560\nI think they're all either Intel or\nNvidia.\n\n330\n00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,040\nBut you'll see other things in\nhere like the third party stuff,\n\n331\n00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,780\nthe end video cards.\n\n332\n00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,080\nYou'll see other things like PPPoE,\n\n333\n00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,090\nthese little add-ons,\nthese are actually extensions.\n\n334\n00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,310\nSee how they all end in .ppp.\n\n335\n00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:37,520\nThat means they're extensions for\nthe ppp kernel extension.\n\n336\n00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,893\nIf I don't have any ppp\nnetwork connections defined,\n\n337\n00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:43,630\nthen it's not gonna load that kernel\nextension and I'm not gonna use it.\n\n338\n00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,140\nBut, if I create a ppp network connection,\nit will load this kernel extension and\n\n339\n00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,360\nthen it will have it available.\n\n340\n00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,100\nSo, it's pretty neat stuff.\n\n341\n00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,150\nBut, if I'm adding hardware\nthat's not in this list, right?\n\n342\n00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,310\nI didn't see Logitech's\nname in here anywhere.\n\n343\n00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,915\nLet me just make sure I'm not lying.\n\n344\n00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:00,260\n[LAUGH] Check the L's real quick.\n\n345\n00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,640\nI'm pretty sure I didn't\nsee Logitech in the list.\n\n346\n00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,150\nNope.\n\n347\n00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,052\nI don't see Logitech in this list anywhere\nbut I added this Logitech track ball.\n\n348\n00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,060\nAll right?\n\n349\n00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,010\nWhat I can do,\nis I can go to Logitech's website and\n\n350\n00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:16,230\nI can download the Logitech driver and\nI can load it on here, that package file.\n\n351\n00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,350\nWhen you run that package file\nIt's gonna copy the extension\n\n352\n00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,680\ninto the library location.\n\n353\n00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,900\nNow it's not going to copy\nit into this location.\n\n354\n00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,900\nThis is slash system slash library,\nslash extensions.\n\n355\n00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,910\nThat's what comes with Yosemite.\n\n356\n00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,950\nInstead, when I load a new driver on,\n\n357\n00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,550\nit's gonna put it in slash\nlibrary slash extensions.\n\n358\n00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,440\nThat's the global area for\nones that we add on.\n\n359\n00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,910\nThere isn't an extensions\nfolder in our user library.\n\n360\n00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,746\nSo if I try to go to slash users,\nslash donpezet,\n\n361\n00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:55,075\nslash library slash extensions.\n\n362\n00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:59,205\nIt doesn't exist, all right, that path\ndoesn't exist because drivers are at\n\n363\n00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:02,985\nthe hardware level, but being run by\nthe colonial, so if you have one user or\n\n364\n00:19:02,985 --> 00:19:06,705\ntwenty users on this computer,\nthey all have access to that extension.\n\n365\n00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:11,665\nIt's part of the base OS at that point, so\nwe just have that global storage area for\n\n366\n00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:16,065\nthat slash library slash extensions,\nso that's where I am right now.\n\n367\n00:19:16,065 --> 00:19:17,945\nAnd if I pull up my directory here,\n\n368\n00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,230\nI'll see I've actually\ngot a few things in here.\n\n369\n00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,030\nThe reason I've got these is\nthis is a virtual machine\n\n370\n00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,320\nthat's running on top\nof Parallels Desktop.\n\n371\n00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,050\nAnd so when I created this virtual\nmachine, I loaded the Parallels Tools so\n\n372\n00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,510\nit would recognize that it\nwas being virtualized and so\n\n373\n00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,610\nit's added some of this on here.\n\n374\n00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,130\nSome of these, though, actually do come\nwith the system, like this Promise.\n\n375\n00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,910\nAnd SoftRAID extension.\n\n376\n00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,900\nThese are actually packaged by Apple.\n\n377\n00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,180\nBut they're put here in the global area so\n\n378\n00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,820\nthat they can be dynamically\nupdated as needed.\n\n379\n00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,865\nBut you'll see various things in\nhere based on your hardware, right?\n\n380\n00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:51,510\nNow I've got this Logitech mouse here.\n\n381\n00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,170\nWhere is it?\nWell,\n\n382\n00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,110\nit's not showing up, and\nthat's because this is my virtual machine.\n\n383\n00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,950\nIf I got to my desktop.\n\n384\n00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:02,981\nLet me just jump over here\nto my actual desktop.\n\n385\n00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:07,826\nAnd, I'll go to /Library/Extensions.\n\n386\n00:20:07,826 --> 00:20:11,420\nAll right, so I'm in slash library,\nslash attentions, and\n\n387\n00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,080\nif I pull up a listing in\nhere I can see right here,\n\n388\n00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,040\nLogitech human interface devices,\nand then Logitech unifine.\n\n389\n00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,020\nSo the human interface device,\nthat's the track ball itself.\n\n390\n00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,220\nAnd then the unifying receiver, that's\nthe little wireless receiver that I've got\n\n391\n00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,330\nplugged into the USB, there's\nactually two pieces to my trackball.\n\n392\n00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,420\nAnd that's because I also have a keyboard\nthat taps into this and some other stuff.\n\n393\n00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,010\nThat's showing up right there,\nI've got the kernel extension.\n\n394\n00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,700\nWhen it sees a Logitech\ndevice get attached,\n\n395\n00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,560\nit will load that kernel extension,\nand it will be running.\n\n396\n00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,980\nIf I unhook it, it'll take the kernel\nextension out of memory and\n\n397\n00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,380\nit'll stop running it until\nI plug the device back in.\n\n398\n00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,350\nSo that's all dynamic\nloaded as you need it.\n\n399\n00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,560\nBut notice how I've got that promise\nPromise and SoftRAID kernel extension.\n\n400\n00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,250\nI didn't add those.\n\n401\n00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,090\nThose were just included by Apple.\n\n402\n00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,170\nI've got a few others in here,\nlike this AX8A179,\n\n403\n00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,970\nthat is actually this guy right here.\n\n404\n00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,810\nThat's USB to ethernet USB adapter.\n\n405\n00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,900\nSo at some point I plug this into\nmy laptop and it needed a driver.\n\n406\n00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,970\nI must have loaded it.\n\n407\n00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,000\nAnd that's it right there.\n\n408\n00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,350\nApparently I did that at some point.\n\n409\n00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,070\nYou can't trust these dates.\n\n410\n00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,290\nLike it says November 8th 2013,\nI didn't have this laptop in 2013.\n\n411\n00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:24,310\nThat's the date of the file,\nas prepared by the manufacturer, so\n\n412\n00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,585\nthat's when they made the driver,\nnot when I installed it.\n\n413\n00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:34,245\n[SOUND] All right so, that's one way\nthat we can load drivers to our system.\n\n414\n00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:39,025\nThere are a few other ways to,\nfor example a driver can be\n\n415\n00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:44,490\nnot part of the base OS but\ninstead part of a frame work.\n\n416\n00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:52,260\nRemember we've got this folder\nwhich is /Library/Frameworks.\n\n417\n00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,410\nAnd as we install\nsoftware on our computer,\n\n418\n00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,920\nthese various frameworks get created.\n\n419\n00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,660\nAnd a framework is just shared\ncode between applications.\n\n420\n00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,580\nSo if I have two applications that\nboth interact with my sound card.\n\n421\n00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,680\nDo I need them both to have code for\ndealing with the sound card?\n\n422\n00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,400\nNo, I can just have a framework for\n\n423\n00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,400\nsound generation and\nthey can both call that framework.\n\n424\n00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,980\nYou see this really commonly with\nthings like video codex, where\n\n425\n00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,690\ndecoding an MPEG file is the same whether\nyou're doing it in your DVD player or\n\n426\n00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,030\ndoing it in a video editor or whatever,\nso they can all call a common framework.\n\n427\n00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,160\nAnd so in the framework could\nbe written the instructions for\n\n428\n00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,990\nhow to deal with certain\nproprietary hardware.\n\n429\n00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,770\nI don't have any great examples of that, I\ndon't think I have anything that uses it,\n\n430\n00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:40,600\nbut you'll see things like OpenGL that\ndoes it, so like a 3D graphics library.\n\n431\n00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,210\nSo if I've got ten video games and they're\nall calling OpenGL, I don't want them each\n\n432\n00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,680\nto have to maintain their own instruction\nset for talking to the video card.\n\n433\n00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,840\nInstead, we can have one\nframework network, and\n\n434\n00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:56,320\nactually I probably do have that,\nlet's see, I don't have it here, well, we\n\n435\n00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,200\ncan see like the audio mix engine, which\nwas the example I was giving a second ago.\n\n436\n00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,420\nIf I have two programs that\nare both editing audio files,\n\n437\n00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,910\ndo they both have to have\nthe instructions for that?\n\n438\n00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,920\nNo.\nSo we can actually have a mixed engine\n\n439\n00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,570\nthat is that common framework.\n\n440\n00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,820\nAnd so it might include a .MIDI mixer for\n\n441\n00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,990\ncommunicating to .MIDI-based\nhardware when we connect to that.\n\n442\n00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,270\nI could be stored right\nthere in the framework.\n\n443\n00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,330\nNow when you look at the framework, you\ndon't actually see the hardware itself,\n\n444\n00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,290\nyou see the framework.\n\n445\n00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,040\nSo it's hard tell what's included\nas part of that framework.\n\n446\n00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,890\nBut you may drivers that\nare involved there.\n\n447\n00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,560\nThe third place you might have\na driver is the least common and\n\n448\n00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,360\nthat's where the driver is actually\nbuild into an application, all right?\n\n449\n00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,930\nSomebody wrote an application and in that\napplication is the instructions that said\n\n450\n00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,980\nspecifically to talk to a particular\npiece of hardware, all right?\n\n451\n00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,465\nYou see this with things\nlike some of those custom\n\n452\n00:23:46,465 --> 00:23:49,525\ntablets that graphic designers will use,\n\n453\n00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:54,542\nwhere the tablet only works when you\nare in a particular application.\n\n454\n00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:57,466\nSo you get the specific graphics app,\nand when you run it,\n\n455\n00:23:57,466 --> 00:24:01,833\nyour tablet works, and when you close that\napp The tablet no longer works, all right.\n\n456\n00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:04,832\nThat's the biggest hint right there\nthat that driver's built into\n\n457\n00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:06,000\nthe application itself.\n\n458\n00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,917\nIt's almost always done\nwith proprietary hardware.\n\n459\n00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:12,560\nA great high visibility\nexample though is iTunes.\n\n460\n00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,240\niTunes has drivers built into it\nspecifically for talking to iPads,\n\n461\n00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,600\niPhones and iPods, right.\n\n462\n00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,500\nThose drivers aren't\npresent in the base OS\n\n463\n00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,260\nbecause other programs aren't allowed to\ntalk to the iPhone, or iPod, or whatever.\n\n464\n00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,340\nBut when you run iTunes,\nit sees the devices, connects up,\n\n465\n00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,310\nmanages them, and even exposes access to\nthe rest of the OS through iTunes, right.\n\n466\n00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,100\nSo, it's giving you that functionality,\nbut\n\n467\n00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,510\nit's the application that\ncontains the driver there.\n\n468\n00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,410\nAll right.\n\n469\n00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,650\nThose last two example though.\n\n470\n00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,650\nFrameworks and applications.\n\n471\n00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,700\nThat's pretty uncommon.\n\n472\n00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,430\nThe driver is normally\nloaded separately and\n\n473\n00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,380\nit's located in that extensions folder.\n\n474\n00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,210\nThat's where we're gonna find it.\n\n475\n00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,020\nAlright well I wanna show you guys and\n\n476\n00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,160\nexample of setting up\nan example like this.\n\n477\n00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,210\nBut let's pause here and take a break.\n\n478\n00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,660\nI don't think I have quite enough\ntime to throw hardware on this one.\n\n479\n00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,410\nSo let's pause here and\nbreak and when we get back..\n\n480\n00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,920\nI'll throw some hardware onto my machine,\n\n481\n00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,880\nand we'll load a driver and\nget to see it in action.\n\n482\n00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:10,665\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n483\n00:25:10,665 --> 00:25:14,040\n[SOUND].\n\n484\n00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,481\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n485\n00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:19,260\nSo, let's take a look at actually\nadding some hardware to our device.\n\n486\n00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,120\nI've got right here this little\nwireless Logitech keyboard and\n\n487\n00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,270\ntouchpad combo device that I like.\n\n488\n00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,570\nIt's kind of a convenient\nthing to use sometimes.\n\n489\n00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,585\nSo, It's a little keyboard,\nand it's wireless.\n\n490\n00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:33,365\nAnd it uses a little,\nalmost lost it, there we go,\n\n491\n00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:37,755\na little wireless receiver that I plug\ninto the laptop to communicate with it.\n\n492\n00:25:37,755 --> 00:25:41,645\nNow, for the most part, it's just a\nkeyboard and a mouse, so when I plug this\n\n493\n00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:46,435\nin, even without a driver, I expect\nthings like all of my letter keys,\n\n494\n00:25:46,435 --> 00:25:48,745\nmy touchpad, and the buttons,\nI expect those to work.\n\n495\n00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:51,325\nBasic mouse, basic keyboard, right.\n\n496\n00:25:51,325 --> 00:25:53,170\nBut on this keyboard.\n\n497\n00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,620\nUp here at the top I've got some\nspecial buttons, like a power button.\n\n498\n00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,020\nWe've got a home button, a music button.\n\n499\n00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,100\nThese are special short cut keys.\n\n500\n00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,530\nAnd these are things you don't\nhave on an normal keyboard.\n\n501\n00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:08,180\nAnd so these are not likely going to\nwork unless I load a driver to enable\n\n502\n00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,780\nthem, okay.\n\n503\n00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,940\nSo when we plug this device in I\nexpect the normal keyboard and\n\n504\n00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,370\nmouse kernel extensions.\n\n505\n00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,700\nWell those are actually\nbuilt into the kernel.\n\n506\n00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,160\nI expect those to kick in and at least\nmake it at least basically function.\n\n507\n00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,990\nBut then I'll need to\nload a driver to make\n\n508\n00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,510\neverything else function\nthe way that I want.\n\n509\n00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,890\nSo let's take a look at that, all right.\n\n510\n00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,390\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this\nmachine that's running my stock Yosemite\n\n511\n00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,520\nand I'm gonna throw on\nthis Logitech receiver.\n\n512\n00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,610\nNow this is a virtual machine, so it might\nmake me flip screens when I do this.\n\n513\n00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,650\nLet's see what happens.\n\n514\n00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,010\nAnd it does that, there we go.\n\n515\n00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,440\nAll right, so I plugged it in.\n\n516\n00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,250\nAnd it sees my keyboard, all right.\n\n517\n00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,500\nSo I get this message here telling me\nthat my keyboard cannot be identified and\n\n518\n00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,920\nwill not be useable until it\nis identified, all right.\n\n519\n00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,168\nSo it launches this little wizard.\n\n520\n00:26:50,168 --> 00:26:54,330\nAnd it's gonna be asking me just\nsome basic questions about my setup,\n\n521\n00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,190\nabout getting this thing enabled.\n\n522\n00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,540\nMy mouse is going a little crazy,\n\n523\n00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,230\nwhich again makes sense because\nmy drivers aren't loaded.\n\n524\n00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,210\nSo, I'm going to use this keyboard and\nkind of advance through this menu,\n\n525\n00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,550\nif it will let me, let's see here.\n\n526\n00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,600\nThere we go.\nAll right.\n\n527\n00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,340\nSince it doesn't know what keyboard I\nhave, it's gonna have to try and guess.\n\n528\n00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,190\nIf I load the drivers from the vendor,\nI won't have to guess.\n\n529\n00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,570\nIt will work just fine.\n\n530\n00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,160\nBut since it doesn't know the keyboard,\nit's guessing.\n\n531\n00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,990\nAnd the way it guesses,\nby asking me to press a few keys.\n\n532\n00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,260\nSo it's saying on my keyboard,\npress whatever's next to your shift key.\n\n533\n00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,680\nWell, on a US keyboard like this,\nnext to the shift key is the letter z.\n\n534\n00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,430\nBut in other languages,\nlike if I have a French keyboard,\n\n535\n00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,260\nit's not the letter z that's by\nthe Shift key, it's a different letter.\n\n536\n00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,480\nAnd so when you press that,\n\n537\n00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,460\nthis is how it's going to start\nto identify the keyboard.\n\n538\n00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,530\nAnd now it's asking me to press the key\nnext to my other Shift key, and so\n\n539\n00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,020\nI'll press that, and it'll try and\nidentify it based on that.\n\n540\n00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,810\nAnd so now it's seeing that I probably\nhave an ANSI United States and\n\n541\n00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:02,570\nother keyboard, 101, or 102 key,\nit doesn't really know.\n\n542\n00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,140\nAnd so that's its suggestion.\n\n543\n00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,970\nRight, if that's good enough for\nme, then I can hit done.\n\n544\n00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,050\nOr I can launch Maps.\n\n545\n00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,140\nI can do all sorts of things here.\n\n546\n00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:15,520\nAnd now my keyboard and\ntrack pad should work, right.\n\n547\n00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,540\nNow, how do I know it's working?\n\n548\n00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,500\nWell, I can try and do some stuff.\n\n549\n00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,490\nLike firing up my terminal,\n\n550\n00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,798\nis what I wanted to do there, but\nMaps has started to get into my way.\n\n551\n00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,590\n[LAUGH] That's awesome.\n\n552\n00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:38,040\nI'm actually seeing a little\nbit of an issue here.\n\n553\n00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:39,940\nThere we go.\n\n554\n00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,600\nAll right.\n\n555\n00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,890\nSo, let me just fire up my terminal.\n\n556\n00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,750\nAnd you can expect odd behavior like\nthis sometimes when you haven't loaded\n\n557\n00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,110\nthe right drivers for the keyboard, or\nwhatever the device is that we attach.\n\n558\n00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:53,220\nThere's parts of it that might\nfunction right, and parts that don't.\n\n559\n00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,260\nSo, I'm gonna launch my terminal.\n\n560\n00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,690\nAnd I'm just gonna try and use it.\n\n561\n00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,620\nI'm using this wireless\nkeyboard as I type some text.\n\n562\n00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,710\nIt looks like my keyboard\nis working just fine, okay.\n\n563\n00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,450\nWell, it did that without\nloading any custom drivers.\n\n564\n00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,720\nIf I look into, this keyboard.\n\n565\n00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,030\nThis is one of those with up arrow\nis really close to the Shift key so\n\n566\n00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,470\nI have to try and navigate around that.\n\n567\n00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:27,490\nSo if I switch into /library/extensions\nand I take a look in here.\n\n568\n00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,820\nI don't see any Logitech\nkernel extensions.\n\n569\n00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,670\nIt didn't go out and download anything.\n\n570\n00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,390\nIt's just running off of\nwhat's built in to the system.\n\n571\n00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:37,220\nAnd using the normal human\ninterface device drivers.\n\n572\n00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,140\nAnd that means that some of my other keys,\nlike the home key and\n\n573\n00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,630\nthe music key,\nwhen I press those on the keyboard,\n\n574\n00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,840\nI'm just kind of pressing them here,\nabsolutely nothing happens.\n\n575\n00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,090\nThose keys are not working because,\nwell, they're not programmed to, right.\n\n576\n00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,070\nThe system doesn't recognize those,\nand they won't until I load a driver.\n\n577\n00:29:55,302 --> 00:29:57,290\nAll right, so if I wanna load a driver,\n\n578\n00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,460\nI'm going to need to go the vendors\nwebsite and download that.\n\n579\n00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:00,990\nAll right.\n\n580\n00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,250\nSo I'm gonna do that next.\n\n581\n00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,370\nNow my mouse is flaking\nout a little bit here so\n\n582\n00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,550\nI'm gonna reboot this machine real quick.\n\n583\n00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,330\nWell shoot.\n\n584\n00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:14,980\nI'm gonna try to reboot the machine real\nquick just to try and straighten that out.\n\n585\n00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,860\nLike my mouse cursor has disappeared.\n\n586\n00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,650\nThese are some of the things that can\nhappen when you're running without\n\n587\n00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,460\nthe proper drivers.\n\n588\n00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,120\nSo I'll just give it a quick\nreboot to let it try and\n\n589\n00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,000\nsort itself out and\nhopefully I'll see my mouse cursor.\n\n590\n00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,130\nAnd the problem here is going to be\nthat I now have a grand total of\n\n591\n00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,110\nthree mice attached to\nthis one virtual machine.\n\n592\n00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,590\nI've got my trackball over here on the\nright, I've got the touchpad on my laptop\n\n593\n00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:38,220\nitself and I've got the touchpad\non this new keyboard I've added so\n\n594\n00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,880\nit's getting a little angry with me.\n\n595\n00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,890\nBut we'll give it a quick restart here and\nsort that out.\n\n596\n00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,300\nNow what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ngo to Logitech's website, and\n\n597\n00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,460\nI'm gonna download\nthe driver from Logitech.\n\n598\n00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,920\nWhen you go to download\na driver from a vendor,\n\n599\n00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,280\nthey'll normally come as a DMG file,\nright.\n\n600\n00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,500\nBut when you open that DMG file,\n\n601\n00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,270\ninside of it, you'll normally\nsee a pkg file, a package, and\n\n602\n00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:05,110\nwe'll have to install that package in\norder for the system to work properly.\n\n603\n00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,270\nSo that's kind of what I expect to see\nwhen I go out to that vendor's website.\n\n604\n00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:13,380\nNow [COUGH] when we go\nto download the driver,\n\n605\n00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,129\nyou might still see some websites\nthat offer both a 32 bit and\n\n606\n00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:22,200\na 64 bit driver, so\nlet's talk about that for a minute.\n\n607\n00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,880\nWhen Apple switched to\na 64 bit architecture for\n\n608\n00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,370\ntheir system, that enabled them to support\nmore memory than previously available.\n\n609\n00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,760\nThe problem there is,\nyour hardware drivers have to do the same.\n\n610\n00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,670\nThey've got to be 64 bit.\n\n611\n00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,890\nIf your OS is 64 bit,\nyou need 64 bit drivers.\n\n612\n00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,500\nIf your OS is 32 bit,\nyou need 32 bit drivers.\n\n613\n00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,950\nWell, Yosemite is a 64\nbit operating system.\n\n614\n00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,917\nSo when I go to download a driver,\nI need 64 bit drivers, all right.\n\n615\n00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:51,253\nSo, you really shouldn't be\ndownloading 32 bit drivers anymore,\n\n616\n00:31:51,253 --> 00:31:54,990\nthat shouldn't be something that\nyou encounter really anywhere.\n\n617\n00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,375\nThose are just for\nwhen we see the older systems.\n\n618\n00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,417\nIf you still have a Mac, like a really\nold Mac that's still a 32 bit.\n\n619\n00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:03,583\nYou might need those.\n\n620\n00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:07,750\nNow how do I know if a driver\nI have is 32 or 64 bit?\n\n621\n00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,908\nWell I've got to go and check in, well\nwhen you download it you'll see it there,\n\n622\n00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:15,883\nbut if you've already got the driver\nloaded you can use system information to\n\n623\n00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:19,333\nfind it, it's actually buried\naway inside system information.\n\n624\n00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:23,920\nIf I take my virtual machine here.\n\n625\n00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,390\nAnd I'll go into System Information.\n\n626\n00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,000\nWhen I go into System Information,\nI see my hardware, I see my network.\n\n627\n00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,950\nAnd if I scroll down, under Software,\nyou'll find extensions.\n\n628\n00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:42,050\nAnd right here I can see lots of\ninformation about the extensions that\n\n629\n00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,600\nare currently on my system.\n\n630\n00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,240\nIt looks blank, but\nnotice down here the spinning wheel.\n\n631\n00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,890\nIt does just take a moment to load.\n\n632\n00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,740\nIt's looking at all the extensions on my\nsystem that's in the global extension\n\n633\n00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,440\nfolder and in the system extension folder.\n\n634\n00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,940\nIt's gonna find them and\ngive me a nice little list.\n\n635\n00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,570\nWhen that list comes up, at the top,\nI've got the list of drivers or\n\n636\n00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,600\nextensions, and\nat the bottom I've got the details.\n\n637\n00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,090\nAnd so I can look through here and\n\n638\n00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,940\nfind any of the various\ndrivers that I'm looking for.\n\n639\n00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,360\nSo maybe I'll look for\nsome of those Nvidia ones.\n\n640\n00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,750\nHere we go, so here's some of those\nNvidia, or no, wait, that's NV Dag.\n\n641\n00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,626\nLet's see if we can find.\n\n642\n00:33:21,288 --> 00:33:22,790\nWell, those will work.\n\n643\n00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,420\nSo if we take one of those drivers and\n\n644\n00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:29,710\nselect it, down here at the bottom\nit'll give us information about it,\n\n645\n00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:33,250\nand I can see this one\ncalm.apple.nvideodriver.nvdagf1, right.\n\n646\n00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,060\nSo here's a driver that's an nvideodriver,\nas I look down at the information,\n\n647\n00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,530\nsee this part where it says architecture.\n\n648\n00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:44,292\nAnd the architecture is listed as x86_64,\nright.\n\n649\n00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:47,880\nWhat does that mean?\n\n650\n00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,570\nIntel processors are referred to as x86\nprocessors, because we have the 8086 and\n\n651\n00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:57,860\nthen the 286, the 386, the 486, those\nwere the common processor architectures\n\n652\n00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,830\nthat came out of Intel and\na lot of systems used.\n\n653\n00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,790\nNow back in the day,\nApple didn't use those.\n\n654\n00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,290\nApple used PowerPC processors instead.\n\n655\n00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:12,420\nSo by the time Apple moved into the Intel\nworld, we weren't really calling them\n\n656\n00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,440\n486s anymore,\nthey were Pentium processors, right.\n\n657\n00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,730\nAnd so now we have these Pentiums,\nand now they call them i4s,\n\n658\n00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:23,160\nsorry, i5s, i3s, i7s, so\nthey have different naming now.\n\n659\n00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,210\nBut x86 is a throwback to\nthe original name, right.\n\n660\n00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,890\nX being any value,\n86 being the end of that processor number.\n\n661\n00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,570\nSo that means an Intel processor and then\nunderscore 64, that means it's a 64 bit.\n\n662\n00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,970\nSo this is the 64 bit architecture,\nthis driver is a 64 bit driver.\n\n663\n00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,990\nNow the 64 bit drivers are sort\nof backwards compatible right.\n\n664\n00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,110\nA 64 bit system can run\n32 bit applications, but\n\n665\n00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:55,080\nthe hardware drivers themselves will\nalways operate in that 64 bit mode.\n\n666\n00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,680\nSo they never truly run in 32 bit mode.\n\n667\n00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,180\nYou could have a 32 bit application\n\n668\n00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,560\nrunning on your 64 bit OS accessing\nhardware with a 64 bit driver so\n\n669\n00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,080\nits really just the application\npiece that can be 32 bit.\n\n670\n00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,415\nAlright so I can see that I can\nlook at any of these driver.\n\n671\n00:35:11,415 --> 00:35:14,575\nThe reality is if you're trying to\ninstall a 32 bit driver, it will fail.\n\n672\n00:35:14,575 --> 00:35:15,925\nIt won't let it install.\n\n673\n00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:18,705\nSo, that's gonna stop you\nfrom having any of those.\n\n674\n00:35:18,705 --> 00:35:22,915\nBut, if you've upgraded a system from\na really old version of Mac OS and\n\n675\n00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:25,262\ncome up to a newer one, that's now 64 bit.\n\n676\n00:35:25,262 --> 00:35:28,032\nWell, first off I don't think you\ncan even do that upgrade path, but\n\n677\n00:35:28,032 --> 00:35:29,242\nlet's say you did.\n\n678\n00:35:29,242 --> 00:35:31,982\nYou might still see some older kernel\nextensions in here that were 32 bit,\n\n679\n00:35:31,982 --> 00:35:34,532\nand they won't be allowed to load, right.\n\n680\n00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,332\nNotice this column over here, loaded.\n\n681\n00:35:38,122 --> 00:35:42,482\nI don't have an Nvidia card,\nso when I look here,\n\n682\n00:35:42,482 --> 00:35:47,302\nthese Nvidia drivers, they're here, but\nthe loaded status is no on all of those.\n\n683\n00:35:47,302 --> 00:35:50,210\nIt's not loaded It's not operational.\n\n684\n00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,780\nIf I sort by loaded,\nI can go to the top and\n\n685\n00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,900\nI can see the ones that are loaded,\nlike this IO bluetooth family.\n\n686\n00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,910\nI've got a Bluetooth controller in here,\nit recognized that, and so\n\n687\n00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,190\nit loaded the extension.\n\n688\n00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,617\nAnd over here,\nI can see loaded, yes, right.\n\n689\n00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,430\nSo when you see a yes\nin that loaded column,\n\n690\n00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,850\nthat's the hardware you\nactually have on your system.\n\n691\n00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,820\nWhen you see a No in that column,\nthat's hardware you don't have, but\n\n692\n00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,070\nit's ready to be supported.\n\n693\n00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,650\nIf you just plug it in,\nthe system's ready to launch it, right.\n\n694\n00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,430\nSo great way to see what's loaded and\nwhat isn't on your system.\n\n695\n00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,872\nAll right, but in my case, I'm dealing\nwith this Logitech keyboard, so\n\n696\n00:36:26,872 --> 00:36:30,230\nI need to get the driver for\nthis one, and get it loaded in here.\n\n697\n00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,690\nIf I sort by name, and\n\n698\n00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,330\nI look in the L section,\nI don't have Logitech anything, right.\n\n699\n00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,840\nSo I'm gonna go out, and I'm gonna get it.\n\n700\n00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,337\nSo I'll fire up my web browser,\ngood old Safari, and\n\n701\n00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:43,347\nwe'll jump over to Logitech's website.\n\n702\n00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:48,248\nAll right,\nnow when we go over to Logitech's website,\n\n703\n00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,810\nwe'll probably have to go\ninto their support, right.\n\n704\n00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,300\nAnd this would be\nthe same with any vendor,\n\n705\n00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,370\nI'm just using them as an example cuz it's\nthe hardware I have sitting right here.\n\n706\n00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,050\nSo I'm looking for support, there we go.\n\n707\n00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,793\nAnd I'll see support and downloads.\n\n708\n00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:01,530\nWe'll jump into that.\n\n709\n00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,560\nAnd now I can come through and\nI can tell it what I'm trying to do.\n\n710\n00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,552\nI'm trying to find downloads.\n\n711\n00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:11,675\nIt recognizes that I'm on a Mac, so\nit's already kinda taking me to those Mac\n\n712\n00:37:11,675 --> 00:37:14,420\nselections, and\nI can tell it what I'm running.\n\n713\n00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,841\nI'm running Yosemite, so 10.10.X.\n\n714\n00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:21,550\nAnd then, it's gonna ask me to pick\nbetween their different products.\n\n715\n00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:27,060\nSo is this gaming software,\nis it preference manager or whatever.\n\n716\n00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,730\nSo I can pick from there.\n\n717\n00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,710\nSo this Logitech gaming software,\n\n718\n00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,150\nthat's for\nsome of their special equipment they have.\n\n719\n00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,610\nBut down here we've got toggling between\nstandard and enhanced key functions for\n\n720\n00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,870\nyour Mac, display,\nbattery status, and more.\n\n721\n00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:42,140\nThis is stuff that adds additional\nfunctionality to your Logitech devices,\n\n722\n00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,020\nlike this keyboard here.\n\n723\n00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,850\nAs you choose different OSes,\nyou might see different options down here.\n\n724\n00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:53,630\nNotice when I choose Mac OS X 10.9,\nI can see more stuff down here.\n\n725\n00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,990\nLogitech Control Center,\nLogitech Preference Manager,\n\n726\n00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,840\nLogitech Unifying Software.\n\n727\n00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,310\nWell, this system is using\none of their unifying keys.\n\n728\n00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,590\nSo I actually need that unifying software.\n\n729\n00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,310\nIt didn't show up when I chose 10.10.\n\n730\n00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,590\nThat means they haven't updated\nthe driver for Yosemite yet, all right.\n\n731\n00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,790\nDoes that mean I can't use the equipment?\n\n732\n00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,560\nProbably not.\n\n733\n00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,960\nUsually the drivers will work, right.\n\n734\n00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960\nSo it probably means I can try it.\n\n735\n00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,190\nIt just hasn't been fully\nsupported by them yet.\n\n736\n00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,860\nSo we'll have to be careful about that,\nand\n\n737\n00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,790\nmake sure that this actually does\nwork the way that we want it.\n\n738\n00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,120\nSo that Logitech unifying software,\nthat's what I want,\n\n739\n00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,810\nthat's what's gonna recognize this little\nadd-on key and make it work properly.\n\n740\n00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,046\nSo I'm gonna download that.\n\n741\n00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,963\nAll right, that's gonna start downloading\nand then I'm just gonna do a quick\n\n742\n00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:37,860\nglance to make sure I don't have\nanything else crazy in here that I need.\n\n743\n00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,340\nI'll probably go ahead and get this\nLogitech preference manager to because I\n\n744\n00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:45,290\nneed those custom keys on my keyboard\nto work so I'll download that one too.\n\n745\n00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,880\nAnd we could do the Logitech\ncontrol center.\n\n746\n00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,389\nThat one lets you customize your mouse and\nkeyboard on the Mac and\n\n747\n00:38:50,389 --> 00:38:51,889\nthat's what I'm dealing with here.\n\n748\n00:38:53,084 --> 00:38:55,124\nYour hardware might just\nhave a single download,\n\n749\n00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:58,282\nyou might have multiple downloads like\nthis, just depends on the hardware,\n\n750\n00:38:58,282 --> 00:39:00,850\nyou've got to go and\nfind the appropriate one, all right.\n\n751\n00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,919\nLet me go and jump over into my downloads.\n\n752\n00:39:04,246 --> 00:39:06,760\nLet me try and jump into my downloads.\n\n753\n00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,390\nThere we go.\nAnd I can see each one is downloading.\n\n754\n00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:14,040\nNotice the unifying software I downloaded\nis a DMG file like I expected.\n\n755\n00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,296\nAnd if I open that up.\n\n756\n00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:21,050\nIt's gonna open up and\nin the dmg file instead of seeing an app\n\n757\n00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:25,230\nthat I can just drag and drop,\nI see a package file, all right.\n\n758\n00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,640\nI'm going to go ahead and\ndouble click on that.\n\n759\n00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,610\nDrivers will normally\ncome as a package file,\n\n760\n00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:32,520\nbecause they're not just copying\nan app to the applications folder.\n\n761\n00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,400\nThey're copying extensions\ninto the library, and\n\n762\n00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,990\nso you need different permission sets for\nthat, all right.\n\n763\n00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,360\nSo I'll just walk through their little\ninstaller, just kind of moving along,\n\n764\n00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,890\nagreeing to their license agreement.\n\n765\n00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,710\nNothing exciting there.\n\n766\n00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,970\nPicking the installation type.\n\n767\n00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:49,210\nTypically a driver won't have any\nchoices here, and we'll install, right.\n\n768\n00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,490\nI do need to provide\nadministrative credentials,\n\n769\n00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,110\nbecause it is modifying something\noutside of the applications folder.\n\n770\n00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,208\nAnd if I type the right password,\nit'll probably work.\n\n771\n00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:00,208\nThere we go.\n\n772\n00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:02,708\nAnd now it's gonna install.\n\n773\n00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:07,595\nSome of the other software that I\ndownloaded from them was not a driver,\n\n774\n00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:11,410\nbut merely software that\ncustomized function.\n\n775\n00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,680\nThat might be an app that I drag and\ndrop, or it might be a PKG file.\n\n776\n00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,660\nIt just depends.\n\n777\n00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,230\nYou'll probably have to\nlook at some of that.\n\n778\n00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,560\nHere it's telling me\nthat I'm ready to go and\n\n779\n00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,690\nit's offering to walk\nme through the set up.\n\n780\n00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,190\nOh I guess I need to plug my key back in.\n\n781\n00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,100\nLet me do that real quick.\n\n782\n00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,090\nAll right.\nI had unplugged the device.\n\n783\n00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:33,040\nSometimes it's a good idea to keep\nthe device unplugged while you walk\n\n784\n00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,770\nthrough the initial setup and\nthen plug it in afterwards so\n\n785\n00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,030\nyou know it loads the right driver.\n\n786\n00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,910\nSo I've got it plugged in now, and\nit's telling me that I need to restart my\n\n787\n00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:46,090\ndevice that I want to connect and so\nI can turn it off and turn it on.\n\n788\n00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:46,880\nThere we go.\n\n789\n00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,350\nAnd it will get connected.\n\n790\n00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,540\nMine was already connected, so\nI really don't have to do this.\n\n791\n00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,210\nI could just cancel out of it and\nthen I'll be in business.\n\n792\n00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,390\nSo once that's done, it's now up.\n\n793\n00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:01,540\nIt's going, and\nI should be ready to rock, right?\n\n794\n00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,790\nLet's go see the extension that I copied.\n\n795\n00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,520\nI'm going to fire up my terminal again.\n\n796\n00:41:07,752 --> 00:41:15,360\nAnd let me just jump into\n/Library/Extensions and\n\n797\n00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,340\ntake a look at what's in here.\n\n798\n00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:20,990\nAnd as I look, actually you know\nI don't see an extension for\n\n799\n00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,710\nthe Logitech driver right in here.\n\n800\n00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,950\nNormally this is where it would come so\nI would expect to see it here but\n\n801\n00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,540\nit could of copied it to one\nof the other locations also.\n\n802\n00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,130\nIt could of copied it into the system one.\n\n803\n00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,810\nThey don't normally do that but\nthey could.\n\n804\n00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:34,890\nIt could of ended up there.\n\n805\n00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,650\nOr it could be that didn't\ninstall an extension at all.\n\n806\n00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:41,400\nAnd if it didn't install an extension\nat all, if it's just software for\n\n807\n00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,130\ndoing unifying extension stuff,\nit could show up as something else.\n\n808\n00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,300\nRemember I mentioned the driver\ncan be part of an application?\n\n809\n00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,660\nWell, there's one type of\napplication I didn't mention,\n\n810\n00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,650\nand that's Preference Pane.\n\n811\n00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:54,450\nIn this scenario,\nthe driver could actually be\n\n812\n00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,370\npart of the Preference Pane because\nI don't need it all the time, so\n\n813\n00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,760\nit might just be loaded when\nI launch Preference Pane.\n\n814\n00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,480\nAnd actually I think that's\nprobably what's going on here.\n\n815\n00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,430\nIf I go into my System Preferences, I'll\nbet I have a Preference Pane for that.\n\n816\n00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,430\nAnd you know I don't.\n\n817\n00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:11,640\nOh, you know, let me plug that back in and\nsee if it appears.\n\n818\n00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,310\nGive that a moment.\n\n819\n00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,250\nYeah, not seeing it there.\n\n820\n00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,880\nSo I'm not sure where this one ended up.\n\n821\n00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,250\nThis might have been a bad example then.\n\n822\n00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,570\nLet me just check the system.\n\n823\n00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,720\nBut actually, I'll show you another\ngreat way to spot these things.\n\n824\n00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,530\nAnother great way to spot them is\nthrough the system information utility.\n\n825\n00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,590\nIn system information you see all\n\n826\n00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:33,090\nof the extensions that are loaded\nregardless of where they're stored.\n\n827\n00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,470\nAnd so if I don't see it in here,\nthen it didn't load an extension.\n\n828\n00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,690\nInstead it just loaded some software.\n\n829\n00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,380\nAnd it's part of the software.\n\n830\n00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,610\nSo we'll let that load.\n\n831\n00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:42,640\nWhile it's loading I'll go ahead and\n\n832\n00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,650\ninstall some of those other\npackages that I downloaded.\n\n833\n00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,780\nI've got the Logitech control center.\n\n834\n00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,000\nThe Logitech Preference Manager right?\n\n835\n00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,020\nThese notice how the icons\nare a little bit different.\n\n836\n00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,710\nThese are software programs and so\nthey're probably bad examples too.\n\n837\n00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:58,220\nYou know, they may not actually have\na dedicated driver for this one.\n\n838\n00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:03,830\nLet's see if we can spot anything\nspecifically for this particular hardware.\n\n839\n00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:08,770\nWe've got, nothing is showing up in there.\n\n840\n00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,740\nLet me type in the product number for\nthis keyboard and\n\n841\n00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,670\nsee if we can find a driver\nspecifically for it.\n\n842\n00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,874\nThis is a k400r.\n\n843\n00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,940\nThere it is,\nthat's exactly what I'm dealing with.\n\n844\n00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,220\nAnd let's see if they actually\nhave a driver for it.\n\n845\n00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,845\nLooks like they've got Windows drivers for\nit, but not Mac drivers,\n\n846\n00:43:29,845 --> 00:43:32,945\nso that would indicate why I don't\nhave a Kernel extension, right there.\n\n847\n00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:35,875\nSee how they have these Windows drivers\nright here, and it's part of that\n\n848\n00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:40,105\nLogitech Unifying Software, so on\nthe Mac side, it's using the Mac driver.\n\n849\n00:43:40,105 --> 00:43:44,065\nSo that's not a great example,\nthen, is it?\n\n850\n00:43:44,065 --> 00:43:47,095\nLet's try my trackball instead, my M570.\n\n851\n00:43:47,095 --> 00:43:50,580\nWe'll see if it's got a driver.\n\n852\n00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,530\nThere we go, there's my trackball.\n\n853\n00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:58,200\nAnd we'll go under it, looks like\nit's got the windows drivers, but\n\n854\n00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,230\nit also has Mac OS.\n\n855\n00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,790\nSo we can use that one\nas a better example.\n\n856\n00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:09,030\nThen we'll go in its downloads, and\nI'll choose mavericks again, 10.9.\n\n857\n00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:09,990\nI don't see 10.10.\n\n858\n00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:14,400\nAnd it's just showing the Logitech control\ncenter and the Logitech unifying software.\n\n859\n00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,130\nIf I jump back through any\nof the previous versions,\n\n860\n00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,440\nI'll probably just see the same thing.\n\n861\n00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,630\nSo I've already got that\nunifying software loaded,\n\n862\n00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,060\nlet me load the control center too.\n\n863\n00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,070\nSo, I've got that.\n\n864\n00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:23,953\nWe'll get it installed.\n\n865\n00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,780\nWe'll go ahead and open it up.\n\n866\n00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,630\nAnd walk through its process so\nit's not too big of a deal.\n\n867\n00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:35,500\nThere we go.\n\n868\n00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,360\nSo we'll go ahead and do it.\n\n869\n00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,250\nIt's telling me there's no\nupdates at this time so\n\n870\n00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,960\nit looks like we've already got it.\n\n871\n00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,620\nAlthough I didn't see.\n\n872\n00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,730\nThere we go.\nThe installer went in the background.\n\n873\n00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,210\nSo I'll go ahead and continue on this one.\n\n874\n00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:46,280\nThe installer for\nthis will be just like the other one.\n\n875\n00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,260\nWe'll go ahead and get it loaded in.\n\n876\n00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:51,220\nI'm just agreeing with their license\nagreement, no real choices here, right?\n\n877\n00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,080\nReally just clicking next a bunch, and\n\n878\n00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,290\nthen providing my\nadministrative credentials.\n\n879\n00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,310\nThere we go.\n\n880\n00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:00,170\nSo anyway when it's done we're gonna\nhave to reboot, so I'll let that do it.\n\n881\n00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,220\nIt'll install.\n\n882\n00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,910\nAnd it should be loading\na kernel extension here.\n\n883\n00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,920\nNow is it gonna load it into\nmy global preferences or\n\n884\n00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,850\nis it gonna tie it into software?\n\n885\n00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,320\nNot entirely sure yet we'll have to see.\n\n886\n00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,070\nAll right.\nIt's asking me what kind\n\n887\n00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:13,810\nof keyboard I've got.\n\n888\n00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:17,820\nWe'll just say it's U.S.\nEnglish and we'll let that finish.\n\n889\n00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,770\nNow it says it's gonna take about two\nminutes and after that it's gonna need\n\n890\n00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:23,310\na reboot and I don't want us to\nhave to sit here and wait for that.\n\n891\n00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,410\nSo why don't we pause here and\ntake a break.\n\n892\n00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:27,320\nWhen it's done I'll reboot the system.\n\n893\n00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:31,250\nAnd afterwards, we'll pick back up and\nget a chance to see that package and\n\n894\n00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,880\ndriver right in there.\n\n895\n00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,080\nSo stay tuned.\n\n896\n00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,017\nWe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n897\n00:45:37,017 --> 00:45:43,005\n[SOUND]\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n898\n00:45:43,005 --> 00:45:46,485\nSo, during the break, the driver finished\ninstalling and the system is rebooted.\n\n899\n00:45:46,485 --> 00:45:49,235\nLet's take a look at wat damage\nwe've done to our system.\n\n900\n00:45:49,235 --> 00:45:53,565\nSo I'm just going to get logged back into\nmy computer, if I can type my password.\n\n901\n00:45:53,565 --> 00:45:56,075\nI'm having a bad password day.\n\n902\n00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,310\nI didn't go with my normal one,\ntwo, three, four, I guess.\n\n903\n00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,840\nI'm going to go ahead and\nget back logged in.\n\n904\n00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,710\nI'm not going to see\nanything much different.\n\n905\n00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,230\nMy mouse works.\n\n906\n00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,640\nThat's exciting.\n\n907\n00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,040\nTo really see whether or\nnot this is done, I need to look and\n\n908\n00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,830\nsee if I've got some Kernel extensions.\n\n909\n00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,330\nSo I'm going to jump\nback into my terminal.\n\n910\n00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:19,470\nWhat I should see,\nis that if I go into /Library/Extensions.\n\n911\n00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:23,280\nWe should now have some Kernel extensions\nand there they are there we go.\n\n912\n00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:29,770\nSo I can see logitechhiddevice.kext and\nlogitechunifying.kext there they are.\n\n913\n00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:30,870\nAll right.\n\n914\n00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:34,930\nThose are the drivers that are being used\nto communicate with that keyboard and\n\n915\n00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:35,960\ntrack ball right?\n\n916\n00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,770\nSo, important to know.\n\n917\n00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,420\nRemember when I installed the unifying\nsoftware first I didn't see\n\n918\n00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,730\na Kernel extension.\n\n919\n00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,610\nIt was able to talk to\nmy unifying receiver\n\n920\n00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:47,360\nbecause the driver was\nbuilt into that software.\n\n921\n00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,390\nThat was an example of\na driver in the software.\n\n922\n00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:55,030\nBut then when I installed the preferences\npane here to be able to set those\n\n923\n00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:58,130\npreferences, it installed\nthe actual Kernel extensions and\n\n924\n00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,310\nput them right here in\n/Library/Extensions.\n\n925\n00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,760\nSo different behavior for\ndifferent drivers.\n\n926\n00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,790\nExpect to see that in real life land.\n\n927\n00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:06,820\nAnd in fact I should have\nmy preference pane now.\n\n928\n00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,210\nIf I go into my system preferences, and\nI scroll down, sure enough, there it is,\n\n929\n00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,580\nthe Logitech Control Center.\n\n930\n00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:16,050\nI've got it, now I can add all the\nLogitech devices to my heart's content,\n\n931\n00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:16,740\nand I'll be ready to rock.\n\n932\n00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:21,430\nAll right now that's one\nexample of adding a device.\n\n933\n00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:23,740\nAnd I added the device they're using USB.\n\n934\n00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,010\nBut there's a number of different buses\nthat are available to attach devices to\n\n935\n00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:27,970\nour computer.\n\n936\n00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:32,590\nSo for this segment what I wanna do is\nhighlight the different mechanisms that we\n\n937\n00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:36,320\ncan use to connect those and the things\nyou need to know about each for the exam.\n\n938\n00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,970\nIn the exam objectives they specifically\npull out a set of buses and\n\n939\n00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,340\nsome of them are what I call legacy buses.\n\n940\n00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,980\nOnes that you don't see\nin modern computers, but\n\n941\n00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,100\nyou need to know them for the exam.\n\n942\n00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,500\nSo that's why it's important\nthat we go over them.\n\n943\n00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,910\nThe first one the exam objectives\ncall out is Bluetooth.\n\n944\n00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:56,727\nBluetooth connectivity is wireless\nconnectivity that allows you to attach\n\n945\n00:47:56,727 --> 00:47:57,978\na device to your laptop or\n\n946\n00:47:57,978 --> 00:48:01,333\ncomputer without having to open it up or\neven run physical cables.\n\n947\n00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:03,216\nBluetooth is really popular for\n\n948\n00:48:03,216 --> 00:48:07,748\ndevices because it's based on our RF waves\nthat do really well when it comes to\n\n949\n00:48:07,748 --> 00:48:11,670\npenetrating walls, so\nit's a great technology for that.\n\n950\n00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:15,340\nBut its range is very, very short.\n\n951\n00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,830\nWhen we talk about something\nlike a WiFi network for\n\n952\n00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:22,670\nnetwork access, you can get\nusually up to about 300 feet away,\n\n953\n00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:26,870\nabout 100 meters away from a wireless\naccess point and still have a signal.\n\n954\n00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:30,920\nWith Bluetooth, you're lucky if\nyou can get ten meters away.\n\n955\n00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,250\nThe range for bluetooth is between one and\n\n956\n00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:37,560\nten meters, which maxes out somewhere\naround 30 or 33 feet or so.\n\n957\n00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,840\nThat's about as far away as you can get\nfrom a computer with a Bluetooth device.\n\n958\n00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,080\nThat makes it great for peripherals\nthat are gonna be right by the computer.\n\n959\n00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,050\nIt makes it bad for\nthings you're gonna roam around with.\n\n960\n00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,860\nA Bluetooth is extremely flexible.\n\n961\n00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,940\nThey make Bluetooth microphones,\nBluetooth,\n\n962\n00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,980\nspeakers, Bluetooth keyboards and mice.\n\n963\n00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,610\nThey make all sorts of Bluetooth\ndevices that you can attach securely\n\n964\n00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:57,130\nto your system.\n\n965\n00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,702\nThe thing you need to remember about\nBluetooth is that there's more than one\n\n966\n00:49:01,702 --> 00:49:02,332\nversion of it.\n\n967\n00:49:02,332 --> 00:49:06,400\nVersion 1.2 is the earliest one\nthat Apple really supported.\n\n968\n00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,810\nI don't think they supported\nanything before 1.2.\n\n969\n00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:13,690\nAnd 1.2 is designed really just for\nsimple devices like keyboards,\n\n970\n00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:16,970\nmice, and\nthose little cellular phone headsets.\n\n971\n00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:21,450\nThey had a maximum speed\nof 721 kilobits per second,\n\n972\n00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:24,650\nwhich is not terribly fast, right?\n\n973\n00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,920\n721 kilobits is great for\na keyboard or a mouse.\n\n974\n00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,630\nIt's terrible for streaming video.\n\n975\n00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,850\nYou wouldn't wanna use it for\nfile transfers.\n\n976\n00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:33,220\nBut it at least got you by for\nbasic connectivity.\n\n977\n00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,030\nThe next major version was Bluetooth 2.1.\n\n978\n00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:40,600\nIt functioned basically like\nBluetooth 1.2, except it went faster.\n\n979\n00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,930\nIt had an upward speed of,\nwas it 3 megabit?\n\n980\n00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:45,990\nYeah, 3 megabit per second,\nwhich is a lot more.\n\n981\n00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:48,700\nThree megabits a lot more reasonable for\nthings like file transfer.\n\n982\n00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,930\nSo now you started to see cameras,\ndigital cameras and\n\n983\n00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:55,850\ncell phones that could Bluetooth connect\nto your computer to copy photos back and\n\n984\n00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:57,710\nforth, copy videos back and forth.\n\n985\n00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,430\nAnd it wasn't blazing fast, but\nit wasn't slow either, right?\n\n986\n00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,570\nIt was kind of a good middle of the road.\n\n987\n00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:08,435\nBut on modern computers, what you're\ngoing to see is Bluetooth 3.0 and 4.0.\n\n988\n00:50:08,435 --> 00:50:10,390\nAnd often times you'll see both.\n\n989\n00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:13,131\nSo my laptop has 3.0 and 4.0.\n\n990\n00:50:13,131 --> 00:50:14,320\nNow, why both?\n\n991\n00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,980\nWell, each one addresses\nsomething different.\n\n992\n00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,510\nBluetooth 3.0 was designed\nto address speed.\n\n993\n00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:24,590\nThey wanted it to be as fast as possible,\nand with Bluetooth 3.0,\n\n994\n00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:27,410\nthe maximum speed on that is 24 megabit.\n\n995\n00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:30,440\n24 megabit is significantly\nfaster than the old\n\n996\n00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,570\nthree megabit that you saw on the old\nBluetooth 2.1, so it's a lot faster.\n\n997\n00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:38,430\nWhen it comes to copying videos and audio\nfiles and other things like that between\n\n998\n00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:42,600\na phone and a computer,\nBluetooth 3.0 does a great job for it.\n\n999\n00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,970\nBut it's energy hungry, so it's not so\ngood if you're worried about battery life.\n\n1000\n00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,750\nIt's good for simple, quick transfers,\nbut it's not good for\n\n1001\n00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,580\nstuff you use all the time.\n\n1002\n00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,710\nSo, for example, on an iPad,\nif you had a Bluetooth keyboard,\n\n1003\n00:50:55,710 --> 00:51:00,170\nhaving a Bluetooth 3.0 keyboard connected\nall the time would run your battery down.\n\n1004\n00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,700\nI used to have one for my tablet, and\n\n1005\n00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:06,930\nit would take usually about 10% to 12%\nof my battery over the course of a day.\n\n1006\n00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,950\nIf I didn't use that tablet\nat all during the whole day,\n\n1007\n00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:13,310\njust having that keyboard attached, we're\ngetting to about 10% to 12% of my battery,\n\n1008\n00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:15,252\nwhich is a pretty big chunk.\n\n1009\n00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:21,170\nBluetooth 4.0 or what it's normally\ncalled is Bluetooth low energy, BLE.\n\n1010\n00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:24,980\nBluetooth low energy was designed\nto address the energy problem.\n\n1011\n00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:29,780\nTo make it a lot less of a battery\ndrain and to make it connect really,\n\n1012\n00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,860\nreally rapidly.\n\n1013\n00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,720\nOne problem with Bluetooth 3.0 is\nif you had a Bluetooth keyboard,\n\n1014\n00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,900\nif it went to sleep you had to wake it up.\n\n1015\n00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,780\nAnd it would take a good 20, 30 seconds\nbefore the device would connect to\n\n1016\n00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,390\nyour computer and you could start typing.\n\n1017\n00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,700\nSo if you wanted a real quick type a note,\n\n1018\n00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,210\nyou weren't doing that on\na Bluetooth 3 keyboard.\n\n1019\n00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:48,740\nBut with Bluetooth 4 it\nwould connect very fast, and\n\n1020\n00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,790\nthen when it wasn't used\nit would go to sleep and\n\n1021\n00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:56,040\nit would consume very little energy, and\nthey achieve that by killing off speed.\n\n1022\n00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:00,920\nBluetooth 4.0 has a maximum speed\nof 200 kilobytes, that means it's\n\n1023\n00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:06,021\nactually slower then Bluetooth 1.0 or 1.2\nit's slower then the oldest technology.\n\n1024\n00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:09,550\nAnd that's because Bluetooth low energy\nwas designed for things like fitness\n\n1025\n00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:14,190\nhealth bands, keyboards, mice,\nstuff you don't use all the time,\n\n1026\n00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:17,330\nstuff that when you need it, you need it\nto work fast, and then when it's done,\n\n1027\n00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:19,540\nyou need it not to consume energy.\n\n1028\n00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,637\nI have a Bluetooth keyboard I\nuse with my iPad and it's BLE,\n\n1029\n00:52:22,637 --> 00:52:27,430\nBluetooth low energy, and it makes no\nnoticeable difference on my battery life\n\n1030\n00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:29,260\nwhether the keyboard's on or off.\n\n1031\n00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,240\nAnd the battery in that things,\nwhen I charge it, it'll stay charged for\n\n1032\n00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,890\na whole month before I\nhave to recharge it.\n\n1033\n00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,800\nBLE is not for speed.\n\n1034\n00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,040\nIt's for battery life.\n\n1035\n00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,245\nAnd so that's why a lot of devices like\nyour MacBook Pros will come with both,\n\n1036\n00:52:42,245 --> 00:52:43,941\nBluetooth 3.0 and 4.0.\n\n1037\n00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:46,080\nWhen you need speed, it'll use 3.0.\n\n1038\n00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,200\nLike when you're connecting a video camera\nand copying video files, it'll use 3.0.\n\n1039\n00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,490\nWell when you're connecting\nyour fitness band,\n\n1040\n00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:53,560\nit'll use 4.0, consuming less energy.\n\n1041\n00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:59,000\nWith all of the Bluetooth standards, you\nhave a maximum amount of devices that you\n\n1042\n00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,110\ncan attach, which is really kind\nof based on your bandwidth, right.\n\n1043\n00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:05,220\nIf you get too many Bluetooth\ndevices attached you start to\n\n1044\n00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,010\nrun out of bandwidth and communications,\nbut otherwise, they're wireless.\n\n1045\n00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,340\nThey just connect up and that's about it.\n\n1046\n00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,280\nWe'll see on some of the wired methods for\nconnecting that we actually have\n\n1047\n00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,940\na solid number of devices,\na maximum number of devices we can attach.\n\n1048\n00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,140\nAll right.\n\n1049\n00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:24,038\nSome of the other connectivity methods\nthey call on the exam, SCSI, S-C-S-I.\n\n1050\n00:53:24,038 --> 00:53:27,930\nSCSI, it stands for\nsmall computer system interface.\n\n1051\n00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:30,140\nAnd it's a legacy connection.\n\n1052\n00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,540\nWe do still see it in some services but\nas far as Macs,\n\n1053\n00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,080\nI don't believe any Macs sold today\ncome with SCSI connections any more.\n\n1054\n00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,270\nI could be wrong in that, but\nI haven't seen one in a long time.\n\n1055\n00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:44,675\nIt used to be, back in the day,\nthat if you bought an iMac or\n\n1056\n00:53:44,675 --> 00:53:49,900\nif you bought a MacPro that it would\nhave SCSI based hard drives in it.\n\n1057\n00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,700\nAnd those SCSI based hard drives\nwere pretty fast at the time.\n\n1058\n00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,810\nThey'd have speeds that were\nup to 320 megabits per second,\n\n1059\n00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:56,710\nwhich is pretty quick,\n\n1060\n00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:00,850\nand that was faster than some of the other\ntechnologies that were out there.\n\n1061\n00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:03,150\nThe drives were more expensive though,\nand so\n\n1062\n00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,100\nthat made them a little less attractive.\n\n1063\n00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,260\nBut one of the cool things about\nSCSI was that you could have\n\n1064\n00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:12,480\nup to 15 SCSI hard drives on\none channel on one connector.\n\n1065\n00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,260\nThey call it SCSI bus and it would\nhave IDs zero through 15, one of them\n\n1066\n00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:20,840\nwill be eaten up by the controller but\nthen the other 15 IDs would be available.\n\n1067\n00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,890\nSo there were 16 IDs total, you hear\npeople say you can have 16 devices.\n\n1068\n00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,920\nBut one of those devices would\nget eaten up by the controller.\n\n1069\n00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,200\nSo you really only have\n15 devices on there.\n\n1070\n00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,430\nAnd you saw that on a lot of Macs.\n\n1071\n00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:35,590\nI used to have an old Mac Quadra,\na long time, like 20 years ago.\n\n1072\n00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:39,039\nAnd it had the big SCSI port on the back\nwhere I could connect SCSI scanner or\n\n1073\n00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:41,790\nSCSI hard drives and\nit had SCSI hard drives on the inside.\n\n1074\n00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:43,720\nIt was all SCSI through the system.\n\n1075\n00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,990\nBut you really don't see that anymore.\n\n1076\n00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,850\nAnother one you don't see anymore is ATA,\nright?\n\n1077\n00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:53,240\nATA drives, you'll hear them called\nparallel drives or IDE drives.\n\n1078\n00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,010\nThis is another standard that\nwe saw on some Macs especially\n\n1079\n00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:00,530\non the earlier MacBooks,\nthey would have the ATA drives.\n\n1080\n00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,700\nIt stands for\nAdvanced Technology Attachment.\n\n1081\n00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,180\nIt was designed for older hard drives.\n\n1082\n00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:10,820\nIt had a maximum speed of 133 megabits,\nwhich was about\n\n1083\n00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:14,740\na third of the maximum speed of SCSI, so\nyou'll see where SCSI is a lot faster.\n\n1084\n00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,500\nBut ATA drives were a lot less expensive,\nand so\n\n1085\n00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,980\nthey were easier to implement especially\nin compact devices, like laptops.\n\n1086\n00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:26,880\nWith ATA, you do have a maximum device\ncount of two devices per channel.\n\n1087\n00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,200\nWith SCSI it was 15, right?\n\n1088\n00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,640\nWith ATA it's only two.\n\n1089\n00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,840\nSo if you had a hard drive and a CD drive\nthat was it, it was maxed out right?\n\n1090\n00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,780\nIf you had two channels you\ncould have four devices.\n\n1091\n00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,390\nIf you had three or\nfour channels you could have more devices.\n\n1092\n00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:42,940\nBut you were limited to two per channel.\n\n1093\n00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,421\nThis is another legacy connector,\nand to my knowledge,\n\n1094\n00:55:46,421 --> 00:55:48,750\nit's not used in any Macs sold today.\n\n1095\n00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,328\nSCSI and\n\n1096\n00:55:49,328 --> 00:55:56,020\nATA were both replaced by a different type\nof connector called Serial ATA, or SATA.\n\n1097\n00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,888\nSerial ATA kind of fixes some of\nthe issues that we had with the older\n\n1098\n00:55:59,888 --> 00:56:02,100\nstandards by increasing the speeds,\n\n1099\n00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,917\nmaking ATA much more in line with\nthe speeds that we saw with SCSI.\n\n1100\n00:56:05,917 --> 00:56:09,208\nWith SCSI I said the maximum\nspeed was 320 megabit.\n\n1101\n00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:12,587\nWith serial ATA, it is 600 megabit.\n\n1102\n00:56:12,587 --> 00:56:13,168\nRight?\n\n1103\n00:56:13,168 --> 00:56:20,650\nRegular ATA was 133 megabit,\nSCSI was 320, serial ATA 600 megabit.\n\n1104\n00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:23,910\nSo serial ATA is faster than both SCSI and\nregular ATA, so\n\n1105\n00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:26,200\nthat kind of pushed them to the wayside.\n\n1106\n00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:32,220\nThere is one negative, with serial ATA,\nyou can only have one device per channel.\n\n1107\n00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:37,000\nSo if I wanna have a hard drive and a CD\ndrive, I've gotta have two SATA channels.\n\n1108\n00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,830\nSo when you buy a desktop,\nit'll oftentimes have four or\n\n1109\n00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,180\nsix channels in it.\n\n1110\n00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:44,710\nBut when you have a laptop, it'll just\nhave the basic channels needed for\n\n1111\n00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,730\nthe devices that are inside of it,\nand that's it.\n\n1112\n00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,600\nSo, a little bit harder to expand.\n\n1113\n00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,490\nBut it's a lot less expensive,\nit's a lot faster, and it works great.\n\n1114\n00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:57,520\nSo a laptop like mine, I don't have an\noptical drive, I just have my SSD drive.\n\n1115\n00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,940\nIt's connected via SATA.\n\n1116\n00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,190\nIf you buy a Mac Pro,\nit's going to come with those SATA drives.\n\n1117\n00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,830\nIf you buy an iMac,\nit's gonna have a SATA drive inside of it.\n\n1118\n00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:06,720\nWhether it's solid state or whether\nit's magnetic, that doesn't matter.\n\n1119\n00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,090\nIt'll be a SATA connect.\n\n1120\n00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:11,710\nAnd if you have an optical drive, like\na super drive it'll usually be connected\n\n1121\n00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:14,730\nVSA also inside of the device, right.\n\n1122\n00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:19,200\nSo, those are the internal buses\nthat we'll see on our System.\n\n1123\n00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,580\nNow with those, it requires opening\nup your device to get at them.\n\n1124\n00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:25,660\nIf I wanna change the hard drive\nin my laptop or in that Mac Pro,\n\n1125\n00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:29,760\nI'm gonna have to open up that case to\nget in there and start to work with it.\n\n1126\n00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,950\nSo we don't normally wanna do that.\n\n1127\n00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:35,980\nThe rest of the buses that Apple calls\nout in the exam are all external ones or\n\n1128\n00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:39,730\nexpansion buses that we can add more stuff\nonto the system without having to crack\n\n1129\n00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:43,880\nopen that case and that's usually\na little more in line with what we want.\n\n1130\n00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,160\nSome of those external ones,\nI already mentioned Bluetooth.\n\n1131\n00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,580\nBluetooth is wireless,\nconnects right up to the System.\n\n1132\n00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:52,400\nI don't have to do any thing crazy there,\nwe've got FireWire.\n\n1133\n00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,170\nNow FireWire used to be\nthe darling of Apple systems.\n\n1134\n00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,990\nSo if you bought an Apple device ten\nyears ago, it had a FireWire port on it,\n\n1135\n00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:02,340\nand then it might've had\nmore than one FireWire port.\n\n1136\n00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:05,720\nAnd you could get digital cameras and\nscanners, hard drives,\n\n1137\n00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,990\nall sorts of stuff that\nwas FireWire connected.\n\n1138\n00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:09,780\nI know Rob, our Web Designer over there,\n\n1139\n00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,450\nhe's got a big FireWire external drive\nhe attaches to his laptop right now.\n\n1140\n00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,660\nSo FireWire was pretty prevalent.\n\n1141\n00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,776\nThere's two main versions of\nFireWire that are out there.\n\n1142\n00:58:18,776 --> 00:58:21,560\nThere's FireWire 400 and FireWire 800.\n\n1143\n00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,189\nAnd the name just refers to how fast\nthey are, 400 megabits per second or\n\n1144\n00:58:25,189 --> 00:58:26,641\n800 megabits per second.\n\n1145\n00:58:26,641 --> 00:58:28,233\nThat's pretty darn fast.\n\n1146\n00:58:28,233 --> 00:58:33,220\n800 megabits per second, that's a lot of\ndata that it can move through that System.\n\n1147\n00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,290\nAnd that gives you some really\ngood connectivity, right?\n\n1148\n00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:38,690\nFireWire had some neat\ncharacteristics to it.\n\n1149\n00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:41,700\nIt was external, right, so you were\njust attaching an external device.\n\n1150\n00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:47,660\nYou could attach up to 63\ndevices on one FireWire port.\n\n1151\n00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:50,760\nYou could run that FireWire port to a hub,\nand then to another hub, and\n\n1152\n00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,790\nto another hub, and\nyou could expand it out to 63 devices.\n\n1153\n00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:55,200\nThat's a lot, right?\n\n1154\n00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,310\nAll on one FireWire port.\n\n1155\n00:58:57,350 --> 00:59:00,740\nNow it was sharing that bandwidth, and\nso when you get more than one device on\n\n1156\n00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,230\nthere, you're starting to\neat away at your bandwidth.\n\n1157\n00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:03,870\nAnd just keep that in mind.\n\n1158\n00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:06,190\nFireWire also provided power.\n\n1159\n00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:10,340\nMost of the other connectors\nlike Serial ATA, ATA, Scuzzy,\n\n1160\n00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,390\nyou had to have a separate power cable.\n\n1161\n00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:15,070\nBut for an external device, we don't wanna\nhave to mess around with those, right?\n\n1162\n00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:17,550\nSo when we have that external device,\n\n1163\n00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:20,590\nit's nice to be able to draw power\nfrom the FireWire cable itself.\n\n1164\n00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:26,800\nAnd FireWire could provide up to 2.5 watts\nof power, which is a pretty decent amount.\n\n1165\n00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,390\nNow if you're trying to scribble\nthese down, like notes real fast,\n\n1166\n00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:29,950\ndon't worry about.\n\n1167\n00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:31,800\nI'm gonna post all this\nwith the show notes.\n\n1168\n00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,680\nI've got it kinda written up in\na nice little table you can look at.\n\n1169\n00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,010\nThat will help you see it.\n\n1170\n00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:38,351\nBut just be aware that FireWire\ndoes provide power and\n\n1171\n00:59:38,351 --> 00:59:39,763\ncan support up to 63 devices.\n\n1172\n00:59:39,763 --> 00:59:43,154\nThe other nice thing about FireWire\nis when you have a FireWire hub,\n\n1173\n00:59:43,154 --> 00:59:46,500\nyou can plug more than one computer\ninto it and share peripherals.\n\n1174\n00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:51,070\nSo you could have a Webcam set up that was\nFireWire and two computers connect to it.\n\n1175\n00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:52,600\nNot at the same time, but\n\n1176\n00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,692\nthey could connect to it, and\nit would be shared between them.\n\n1177\n00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:57,920\nAll right.\n\n1178\n00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,230\nFirewire though didn't really\nstick around all that long.\n\n1179\n01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,720\nIt had a good run, maybe about ten,\n\n1180\n01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,660\nyears but over time Firewire didn't\nget adoption outside of Apple.\n\n1181\n01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:11,650\nWe did see some Sony VAIO laptops that had\nFirewire and some other vendors but for\n\n1182\n01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,710\nthe most part it was an Apple thing,\nright?\n\n1183\n01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:17,350\nOutside of Apple world USB.\n\n1184\n01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:18,910\nThe Universal Serial Bus.\n\n1185\n01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,670\nThat is what really picked up.\n\n1186\n01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:22,960\nAnd USB use has seen seen\nseveral versions over the would.\n\n1187\n01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,050\nIt has been so\n\n1188\n01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:28,790\nprevalent across computers all across\nthe world that even Apple uses USB.\n\n1189\n01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:32,340\nSo when you buy an Apple device,\nit's rare that you just have firewire,\n\n1190\n01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:35,220\nyou would also have USB right next to it.\n\n1191\n01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:40,080\nAnd FireWire has pretty much been replaced\nby a newer technology called Thunderbolt.\n\n1192\n01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,710\nAnd so a laptop like mine, I don't even\nhave any FireWire ports on here but\n\n1193\n01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:46,120\nI do have Thunderbolt,\nI have two Thunderbolt ports, but\n\n1194\n01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:50,582\nI still have USB also, because USB is\njust so much more prevalent out there.\n\n1195\n01:00:50,582 --> 01:00:51,690\nAll right.\n\n1196\n01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,240\nSo let's talk about the pros and\ncons of these.\n\n1197\n01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,590\nUSB.\n\n1198\n01:00:55,590 --> 01:01:00,660\nWith USB, you can have up to 127 devices\nplugged into a single controller.\n\n1199\n01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:03,450\nSo a single port on your System,\nyou can put 127 devices in there.\n\n1200\n01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:04,850\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n1201\n01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:06,740\nThat's a lot of devices.\n\n1202\n01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,110\nUSB provides power.\n\n1203\n01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:09,720\nNot very much, though.\n\n1204\n01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,980\nUSB only provides, actually I think\nI've got these backwards in my notes.\n\n1205\n01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,180\nI said 2.5 watts for FireWire.\n\n1206\n01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:19,210\nI'm pretty sure FireWire is 7 watts and\nusb is 2.5 watts.\n\n1207\n01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:22,910\nI know USB provides less wattage, so I'll\nhave to verify that after the show and\n\n1208\n01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:24,110\nmake sure I've got that right.\n\n1209\n01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,770\nUSB doesn't provide a lot of power.\n\n1210\n01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,960\nIf you plug a keyboard or\na mouse in, USB will power it.\n\n1211\n01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,760\nBut, if you plug a hard drive in,\n\n1212\n01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,300\nUSB doesn't normally provide enough\npower to spin up that hard drive, right?\n\n1213\n01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,130\nSo, it's not a great amount of power,\nbut there is some.\n\n1214\n01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:42,250\nSo, a lot of external USB devices have\nto be powered or you get powered hubs.\n\n1215\n01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:44,510\nWhere the hub actually plugs into\nthe wall to create more power.\n\n1216\n01:01:46,472 --> 01:01:49,920\nAll right, so we've got a few things\nto be aware of there,127 devices,\n\n1217\n01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,910\nthere's also more than one version of USB.\n\n1218\n01:01:53,910 --> 01:02:00,529\nOn your System you'll likely USB 1.1 or\nUSB 2.0 Or USB 3.0.\n\n1219\n01:02:00,529 --> 01:02:02,670\nThere's not much different between them.\n\n1220\n01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:05,280\nWhen you look at the port on the computer,\nthe port looks the same,\n\n1221\n01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,750\nthe cable looks the same.\n\n1222\n01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,745\nBut the difference is the speed.\n\n1223\n01:02:08,745 --> 01:02:09,368\nAll right.\n\n1224\n01:02:09,368 --> 01:02:11,670\nUSB 1.1 was the very first version.\n\n1225\n01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:17,850\nIt came out in the 1990s and\nit had a maximum of 1.5 megabit.\n\n1226\n01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:21,920\nAll right, 1.5 megabit not\nvery much speed there at all.\n\n1227\n01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,990\nBut if you're talking about keyboards and\nmice, modems, that was a ton.\n\n1228\n01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:29,080\nBack then in the 90s 1.5\nmegabit was a ton of bandwidth.\n\n1229\n01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,400\nToday it's not.\n\n1230\n01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,718\nAnd so\nUSB 2.0 was designed to correct that.\n\n1231\n01:02:33,718 --> 01:02:40,260\nWhen USB 2.0 was released it bumped that\nspeed up from 1.5 megabit to 480 megabits.\n\n1232\n01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:44,900\nThat's a substantial jump right that's\na huge jump to 480 megabit and I remember\n\n1233\n01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:49,820\nthe first time I got a USB 2.0 device, I\nwas stoked I was like man this is so fast.\n\n1234\n01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:52,400\nBut today when I plug in\na USB two device I'm like oh\n\n1235\n01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,890\ngreat USB 2.0 I'm gonna have\nto wait forever to copy stuff.\n\n1236\n01:02:56,050 --> 01:03:01,120\nIt was fast at the time,\nnot so fast anymore.\n\n1237\n01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,010\nAll right.\nSo USB 3.0 design was designed to correct\n\n1238\n01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:07,332\nthat and it weighs in at 5 gigabit right.\n\n1239\n01:03:07,332 --> 01:03:12,230\nOr 5 a thousand megabit per second, way\nfaster than USB 2.0, so when you plug in\n\n1240\n01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:17,580\nthat USB 3 device, it's nice and fast,\ncopies that data, works really well, okay.\n\n1241\n01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:21,840\nSo, several different versions that\nare out there, when you buy a newer Mac,\n\n1242\n01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,580\nit's gonna come with USB 3.0 on it, right.\n\n1243\n01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:28,370\nIt's fully backwards compatible, so\nyou can plug USB 2 or USB 1.1 devices in.\n\n1244\n01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:30,870\nYou can have a hub and you can mix.\n\n1245\n01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:33,000\nYou can have all three versions of USB,\n\n1246\n01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,560\nrunning into your device via\nthat USB 3 port, if you want.\n\n1247\n01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:40,800\nUSB 3.0 ports are normally easy to spot\nbecause if you look inside the port,\n\n1248\n01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,966\nthey're usually colored blue.\n\n1249\n01:03:41,966 --> 01:03:46,380\nUSB 2.0 and 1.1,\nthey were colored black so\n\n1250\n01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,170\nit's pretty easy to spot that difference.\n\n1251\n01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:52,333\nBut, those are some of the USB\nstandards that are out there.\n\n1252\n01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:57,833\nBut the best connectivity method, one that\nyou wanna use if you can it's Thunderbolt.\n\n1253\n01:03:57,833 --> 01:04:00,998\nThunderbolt is a technology\ndesigned by Intel and\n\n1254\n01:04:00,998 --> 01:04:05,833\nApple to replace FireWire and\nreally to replace USB 2.0 for that matter.\n\n1255\n01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:12,770\nBut with Thunderbolt- You get a very\nflexibility, very, very fast connector.\n\n1256\n01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:14,980\nSpeed is of the essence with Thunderbolt.\n\n1257\n01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:19,300\nAnd versatility, you can connect all\nsorts of things with Thunderbolt.\n\n1258\n01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:22,720\nA Thunderbolt port, well,\nactually let me clarify this real quick.\n\n1259\n01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,650\nThere's two versions of Thunderbolt.\n\n1260\n01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:28,840\nThere's Thunderbolt 1, the original\none and inside of Thunderbolt one,\n\n1261\n01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:32,630\nyou had 210 gigabit channels.\n\n1262\n01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:35,580\nAnd that meant you could send 10 gigabit.\n\n1263\n01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:39,040\nAnd receive 10 gigabit at the same time.\n\n1264\n01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,920\nOr, if your device supported it,\n\n1265\n01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,610\nlike you might have some monitors that\nhave two Thunderbolt ports on them.\n\n1266\n01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:46,610\nWhere you could send 20 gigabit,\nten over each channel,\n\n1267\n01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,830\nthat was just a send communication.\n\n1268\n01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:50,870\nTo a monitor,\nyou normally send data to a monitor,\n\n1269\n01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:52,340\nyou don't get data back from a monitor.\n\n1270\n01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:56,440\nSo you could get more, and that's what was\npowering some of the earlier 4K TVs and\n\n1271\n01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,090\n4K monitors,\nwas running two Thunderbolt cables to it.\n\n1272\n01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:03,030\nBut Thunderbolt 2, that's the newer one.\n\n1273\n01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:05,200\nWith Thunderbolt 2 it does\nwhat's called port interaction.\n\n1274\n01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,910\nIt can dynamically combine\nthose channels together so\n\n1275\n01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:12,140\nyou can have one thunderbolt\ncable that's pushing 20 gigs of\n\n1276\n01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:17,030\ndata out to that monitor and doing it\nright there in a single line, all right.\n\n1277\n01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:20,320\nWith Thunderbolt you can get\n20 gigabit of bandwidth.\n\n1278\n01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,670\nThat's way beyond any of\nthe other technologies.\n\n1279\n01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:26,360\nThe fastest one that I've talked about so\nfar is USB 3 with 5 gigabit.\n\n1280\n01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,320\nThis one's 20, that much faster.\n\n1281\n01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,450\nSo right off the bat,\nwe've got a huge speed improvement.\n\n1282\n01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:35,980\nThe other thing is, with Thunderbolt,\nwe can do daisy chaining.\n\n1283\n01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:39,490\nA lot of devices that you buy like\nif you get an Apple cinema display\n\n1284\n01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:41,620\nit'll have two Thunderbolt ports on it.\n\n1285\n01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:45,790\nNot like the old 4K TVs when you had to\nrun two cables to it just to get that\n\n1286\n01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:46,820\nproper bandwidth.\n\n1287\n01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,320\nNow you run one cable to the monitor and\n\n1288\n01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,655\nthen you can run another cable from\nthe monitor, to another monitor.\n\n1289\n01:05:52,655 --> 01:05:55,845\nOr to another Hard drive, or\nto some other Thunderbolt device, and\n\n1290\n01:05:55,845 --> 01:05:57,765\nyou can daisy-chain them together.\n\n1291\n01:05:57,765 --> 01:06:01,065\nYou can daisy chain up to\nten devices on Thunderbolt.\n\n1292\n01:06:01,065 --> 01:06:04,695\nSo, we can have ten devices in line\nall off of one Thunderbolt port, and\n\n1293\n01:06:04,695 --> 01:06:05,295\nthat's pretty cool, right.\n\n1294\n01:06:07,085 --> 01:06:11,860\nThe other thing about Thunderbolt is\nthat the connector type they used\n\n1295\n01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:14,680\nis the same for DisplayPort, and so\n\n1296\n01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:19,340\nwhen it comes to connecting monitors, even\nif you have a non-Thunderbolt monitor,\n\n1297\n01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:22,508\nyou can run a DisplayPort cable and plug\nit in there and connect the monitor up.\n\n1298\n01:06:22,508 --> 01:06:27,420\nNow, with DisplayPort, you're not going\nto get the same ability to daisy chain,\n\n1299\n01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:31,010\nand stuff like that, it's got to be\na Thunderbolt monitor to daisy chain.\n\n1300\n01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:33,110\nBut you will be able to plug into\nthat port and make use of it.\n\n1301\n01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,360\nSo it kinda becomes a multi use port.\n\n1302\n01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,420\nAnd you can get all sorts\nof Thunderbolt stuff.\n\n1303\n01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,970\nOn my desk,\nI've got a Thunderbolt monitor,\n\n1304\n01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:42,560\nI've got a Thunderbolt hard drive,\nand I connect those up,\n\n1305\n01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,880\nand that's what I use to store my\ndata on and look at my computer.\n\n1306\n01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,220\nWhen I'm up here on the show,\nI've got a Thunderbolt Network Adapter, so\n\n1307\n01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:53,250\nmy Physical Network Adapter is\nThunderbolt that I plug in to the side.\n\n1308\n01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,640\nAnd when I'm out helping people\nwith their networks or whatever,\n\n1309\n01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,440\nI've got other Thunderbolt devices that\nI can plug in to make use of that.\n\n1310\n01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:03,060\nLike a Thunderbolt to VGA, or\na Thunderbolt to DVI adapter.\n\n1311\n01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,510\nWhich is not really Thunderbolt.\n\n1312\n01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:05,920\nIt's display port.\n\n1313\n01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,290\nDisplay port to DVI, and\nI stick that in there, and\n\n1314\n01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:11,440\nnow I can connect to a projector and\ndo a presentation, right.\n\n1315\n01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,640\nSo, really diverse port, and\n\n1316\n01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:18,095\nbecause of the high speeds, Apple's\nreplaced FireWire with Thunderbolt.\n\n1317\n01:07:18,095 --> 01:07:19,455\nSo when you buy a newer laptop like mine,\n\n1318\n01:07:19,455 --> 01:07:23,115\nit won't have FireWire anymore,\nit's been superseded.\n\n1319\n01:07:23,115 --> 01:07:25,995\nThey do make a FireWire to\nThunderbolt Adapter that you can buy and\n\n1320\n01:07:25,995 --> 01:07:28,145\nstick on there, so you have that option.\n\n1321\n01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:29,707\nThunderbolt is very flexible.\n\n1322\n01:07:29,707 --> 01:07:33,175\nAll right.\n\n1323\n01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:36,980\nSo those are the primary bus types,\nand connectors.\n\n1324\n01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:39,640\nThere's one other type\nthey mention on the exam.\n\n1325\n01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,300\nAnd I'm not entirely sure why they do.\n\n1326\n01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,065\nBut they call out PC Card.\n\n1327\n01:07:44,065 --> 01:07:45,040\nAll right.\n\n1328\n01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,270\nPC Card.\n\n1329\n01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:49,510\nThey don't sell any Apple devices\nto support to PC Card anymore.\n\n1330\n01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:54,930\nI haven't seen a device use PC Card\nin at least seven years probably?\n\n1331\n01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:56,460\nSo this is an older one.\n\n1332\n01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,270\nThis was for laptops.\n\n1333\n01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:02,370\nLaptops used to have a port that was\navailable on them that would accept\n\n1334\n01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,750\nwhat was called a PC card.\n\n1335\n01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,635\nNow it went through\nseveral different names,\n\n1336\n01:08:05,635 --> 01:08:09,735\nthe original name was a PCMCIA card.\n\n1337\n01:08:09,735 --> 01:08:11,445\nIt was the worst acronym ever.\n\n1338\n01:08:11,445 --> 01:08:12,675\nI've got it written down here.\n\n1339\n01:08:12,675 --> 01:08:14,785\nLet me tell you.\nIt's Personal Computer\n\n1340\n01:08:14,785 --> 01:08:18,985\nMemory Card International Association,\nnice long name there.\n\n1341\n01:08:18,985 --> 01:08:21,935\nYou could buy memory cards, network cards,\n\n1342\n01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:25,065\nother types of expansions it\nwould be able to support.\n\n1343\n01:08:25,065 --> 01:08:29,540\nIt was replaced by PC Card,\nwhich then was replaced by Express Card.\n\n1344\n01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,850\nAnd, so, the newest version\nof it was ExpressCard, and\n\n1345\n01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:34,460\nthe last time I saw that was\nliterally seven years ago.\n\n1346\n01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:37,560\nIt was a long time ago, so\nall of these are pretty much dead.\n\n1347\n01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,610\nBut, it was a special type of expansion,\nand I don't have any,\n\n1348\n01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:43,510\nI couldn't even find a device here\nin the building that used it.\n\n1349\n01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,310\nI guess here I could do\na Google image search and\n\n1350\n01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:47,960\nshow you guys what it looks\nlike if you've never seen it.\n\n1351\n01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,510\nLet's just pull this up here.\n\n1352\n01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:51,330\nExpress cards.\n\n1353\n01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:56,110\nThere we go.\nThese are express cards right here.\n\n1354\n01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:58,330\nSo some of them are smaller like this.\n\n1355\n01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:01,100\nOthers would do double data connectors,\nand so they were bigger.\n\n1356\n01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:05,530\nThey would actually have a little bit\nextra information or this guy here.\n\n1357\n01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:07,960\nHe's got a whole array of them,\ndifferent devices.\n\n1358\n01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:12,480\nSo these are express cards and they would\njust pop right into a port on the device.\n\n1359\n01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,650\nApple only had it for handful of devices\nfor a little while and it's gone now so\n\n1360\n01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:20,790\nwe don't see it, but if you do PCard,\n\n1361\n01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:25,170\nthe original PCard standard\nhad a band with a 1.2 megabit.\n\n1362\n01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:28,470\nExpress card, the newer version,\nwent up to 2.5 megabit.\n\n1363\n01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:30,300\nIt was pretty speedy.\n\n1364\n01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:34,140\nIt was based on the PCI express bus so\nit was kinda tapping into the bus right on\n\n1365\n01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:38,100\nthe mother board of the lap top and\nthat gave you some pretty good speed.\n\n1366\n01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,770\nIt just wasn't used very much.\n\n1367\n01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:41,030\nAnd now that we have Thunderbolt,\n\n1368\n01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:44,450\nthat's four times the speed of that,\nwe don't really need it anymore.\n\n1369\n01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:45,670\nSo that's why we don't\nsee this one either.\n\n1370\n01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:47,810\nThese are legacy bus types.\n\n1371\n01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:50,869\nBut they can show up on the exam, so\nyou need to be familiar with those.\n\n1372\n01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:53,790\nAll right.\n\n1373\n01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:57,370\nNow, if you're curious what bus\ntypes your system supports,\n\n1374\n01:09:57,370 --> 01:10:00,420\nyou can easily see that in\nthe system Information Utility.\n\n1375\n01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:06,430\nIf I fire up System Information, inside\nof System Information under Hardware,\n\n1376\n01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:09,040\nyou basically get a list of\nyour bus types right here.\n\n1377\n01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,400\nHere's ATA, right?\n\n1378\n01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,840\nDown here I can see Serial ATA,\nwe've got SCSI, and\n\n1379\n01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,640\nyou've got parallel SCSI and\nserial-attached SCSI.\n\n1380\n01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,250\nTwo different versions of it.\n\n1381\n01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:23,290\nI can see other things like USB and\nThunderbolt, FireWire.\n\n1382\n01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:26,590\nNow, I don't even have a FireWire port\non my System, so it tells me that.\n\n1383\n01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:31,500\nNo FireWire ports were found, but\nunder USB, I do have USB ports.\n\n1384\n01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,060\nAnd it's showing me what's attached.\n\n1385\n01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:37,380\nLike, there's my FaceTime ID camera,\nmy keyboard, my mouse, right.\n\n1386\n01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,000\nThese different things\nthat are showing up.\n\n1387\n01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:39,970\nI'm on a virtual machine.\n\n1388\n01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:42,090\nSee, that's my virtual mouse or whatever.\n\n1389\n01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:44,310\nLet me show you on my physical machine.\n\n1390\n01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:47,910\nLet me just bring up System Information.\n\n1391\n01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:50,540\nHere we go.\n\n1392\n01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:57,120\nI'll take a look at USB, and on here I\ncan see my BlueTooth USB host controller.\n\n1393\n01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,150\nI've got a Memory Card Reader.\n\n1394\n01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:02,700\nThat one's showing up as\nUSB 3.0 super speed bus.\n\n1395\n01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,350\nAnd USB High Speed bus.\n\n1396\n01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:08,470\nSo each of these are showing up\nwith what bus their attached to and\n\n1397\n01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:09,210\nhow their functioning.\n\n1398\n01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:15,360\nIf I look at my Thunderbolt, here we go,\nI get my Thunderbolt device tree,\n\n1399\n01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,050\nand there's my thunderbolt\nto Gigabit Ethernet Adaptor,\n\n1400\n01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:21,170\nthat's plugged in right here,\nI can see the attachment on that bus.\n\n1401\n01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:24,750\nBut if I got to FireWire, I don't have\nany FireWire ports, doesn't show up,\n\n1402\n01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,210\nI don't have it.\n\n1403\n01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:28,030\nAnd if I go to ATA.\n\n1404\n01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:33,960\nI don't have any ATA ports, but\nif I go to Serial ATA, there's my SSD.\n\n1405\n01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:34,940\nRight, my Solid State.\n\n1406\n01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:38,030\nI've got a 500 gig SSD in this laptop,\nand so I can see it.\n\n1407\n01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:39,320\nThere's the information about it.\n\n1408\n01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:39,940\nIt's up.\n\n1409\n01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:40,720\nIt's running.\n\n1410\n01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,550\nAnd it's happy.\n\n1411\n01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:44,110\nSo you can see all of your\nbuses right here, and\n\n1412\n01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:46,620\nsee which devices are attached to them,\nright inside of System Information.\n\n1413\n01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,511\nAll right, well, that's about it for\nour bus types and getting those attached,\n\n1414\n01:11:53,511 --> 01:11:55,500\nsome of the different\nthings that are there.\n\n1415\n01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,930\nThe only other thing I want to cover\non Peripheral Devices are printers.\n\n1416\n01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:03,412\nAs far as keyboards, mice,\ncameras, microphones and so on,\n\n1417\n01:12:03,412 --> 01:12:05,792\nApple leaves that up to the third parties.\n\n1418\n01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:09,408\nBut for the exam, they want you to be\nfamiliar with how to add printers to\n\n1419\n01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:13,708\nthe system, how to share printers out, so\nit's a peripheral they really focus on.\n\n1420\n01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:16,610\nSo I wanna spend a segment\nlooking directly at printers and\n\n1421\n01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:20,417\nhow they function, and so that's what\nwe're gonna do in the next segment.\n\n1422\n01:12:20,417 --> 01:12:23,270\nSo let's stop here and\ntake a break and when we get back,\n\n1423\n01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:25,270\nwe're gonna see printers in action.\n\n1424\n01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:26,581\nStay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n1425\n01:12:26,581 --> 01:12:33,375\n[MUSIC]\n\n1426\n01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:34,902\nAll right welcome back everybody, so\n\n1427\n01:12:34,902 --> 01:12:38,002\nin this last segment we are going to take\na look at printers specifically, and\n\n1428\n01:12:38,002 --> 01:12:41,167\nsome of the things we need to be aware of\nwhen we add them as a peripheral device.\n\n1429\n01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:44,002\nNow when you attach a printer to your Mac,\n\n1430\n01:12:44,002 --> 01:12:47,000\nthere are a few different\nways you can do it.\n\n1431\n01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,618\nIt might be that it's already attached to\nsome other computer on the network and\n\n1432\n01:12:50,618 --> 01:12:52,280\nit's being shared out.\n\n1433\n01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,460\nAnd that's the scenario we\njust fire up the finder and\n\n1434\n01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:56,780\nwe'll see it in our shared devices and\nwe connect to it.\n\n1435\n01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:57,320\nThat's it right?\n\n1436\n01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,290\nSuper easy and we're done.\n\n1437\n01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:01,540\nBut that's not normally the case.\n\n1438\n01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:06,540\nNormally, our printer is either gonna plug\nin with a cable directly into our system.\n\n1439\n01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:10,490\nUSB, or Thunderbolt, FireWire,\nhowever USB's probably the most common.\n\n1440\n01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:15,080\nOr it's gonna be on our\nwireless network or\n\n1441\n01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:18,500\nour wired network, and we'll connect\nto it based on an IP address, or\n\n1442\n01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:22,070\nBonjour will find it on the network, and\nyou can connect directly to it, right?\n\n1443\n01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:25,020\nThat's getting to be even more common.\n\n1444\n01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:28,890\nIf it's a wired printer, you plug in\nthe wire, and what's gonna happen is,\n\n1445\n01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:31,760\nyour Mac is going to detect it and\nit's gonna try and\n\n1446\n01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,190\nload one of Apple's built-in\ndrivers to make that printer work.\n\n1447\n01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:37,340\nAnd the majority of the time, that's fine.\n\n1448\n01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:39,210\nBut like I mentioned at\nthe beginning of the show,\n\n1449\n01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:42,880\nthose built-in drivers might not\nhave all the features that we want.\n\n1450\n01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,930\nSo we might need to add additional\ndrivers to get that full support.\n\n1451\n01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:47,670\nRight?\n\n1452\n01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:49,750\nThe same thing goes with network printers.\n\n1453\n01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:50,830\nThe difference with a network printer,\n\n1454\n01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:54,300\nthough, is the system doesn't\nautomatically detect them, right?\n\n1455\n01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,580\nWith a wired one I plug it in,\nthat gives it a moment to see that and\n\n1456\n01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:58,660\nknow to do something.\n\n1457\n01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:01,850\nBut with a network printer it doesn't\nknow whether we want that printer or not.\n\n1458\n01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:04,810\nJust because there's a printer on\nthe network, doesn't necessarily mean we\n\n1459\n01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:07,610\nwant to connect to it,\nversus if we plug into our computers,\n\n1460\n01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,655\npretty safe to assume we\nwanna connect to that.\n\n1461\n01:14:09,655 --> 01:14:14,110\nBut, on a network one,\nwe have to tell it to go out and get that.\n\n1462\n01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,020\nSo let me show you how that process works.\n\n1463\n01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:20,810\nTo add a printer, we just go\ninto our System Preferences, and\n\n1464\n01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:23,270\ninside of System Preferences,\nyou got the Printers and\n\n1465\n01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:25,150\nScanners system preference right there.\n\n1466\n01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:30,120\nAnd if I go into that I'll get a chance\nto see the printers that I've got\n\n1467\n01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,280\non my system already.\n\n1468\n01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,480\nNow I don't have many.\n\n1469\n01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,850\nactually I don't have any.\n\n1470\n01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:35,590\nThere's no printers by default.\n\n1471\n01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:36,740\nI need to add them in.\n\n1472\n01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:39,520\nIf I manually plug one in,\nthis is where it will show up.\n\n1473\n01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,700\nIt will load with the Apple drivers.\n\n1474\n01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,680\nBut if it's on the network,\nI might need to punch one in myself.\n\n1475\n01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,470\nAnd I've got the little plus sign\nright here that I can hit to do that.\n\n1476\n01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:48,980\nAnd now it's going to ask for the printer.\n\n1477\n01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:50,720\nNow it does something really neat.\n\n1478\n01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,310\nIt immediately starts scanning\nthe network to find the printers, and\n\n1479\n01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:57,540\nI can see where it just\nfound one Tim color laser.\n\n1480\n01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,990\nThis is the laser printer\nthat's in Tim's office.\n\n1481\n01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:04,010\nIt's found it on the network and\nit found it using Bonjour, right?\n\n1482\n01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:05,730\nThat's service discovery protocol.\n\n1483\n01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:08,540\nIt discovered the printer\nout there in the network.\n\n1484\n01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:13,120\nSo it's found it, and if I wanna connect\nto it, I can just select it and connect.\n\n1485\n01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:16,070\nTim's printer supports more\nthan one connectivity model.\n\n1486\n01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:18,772\nThe default is Use AirPrint, right.\n\n1487\n01:15:18,772 --> 01:15:20,050\nApple AirPrint.\n\n1488\n01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:22,540\nIf your printer supports that,\nthat works great,\n\n1489\n01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:26,190\nyou can connect to it wirelessly and\nprint right to the device.\n\n1490\n01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:28,160\nBut you might have more than one method,\n\n1491\n01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:32,210\nand if I drop that down, see how I\nhave more than one things I can do?\n\n1492\n01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:36,030\nI can connect to it using PCL,\nthe Printer Control Language.\n\n1493\n01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:38,240\nOr I can connect using postscript.\n\n1494\n01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:42,230\nPostscript is a great one for guaranteeing\nyou get the right font on the printer.\n\n1495\n01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:46,950\nOr I can connect using\nan actual HP LaserJet 400 color\n\n1496\n01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:50,290\nMFP M475 GW driver and direct connection.\n\n1497\n01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:52,930\nSo several different ways I can connect.\n\n1498\n01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:57,150\nWhat each of these are doing is\nchanging the format of the document\n\n1499\n01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:58,920\nI send to the printer.\n\n1500\n01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,920\nWhen you print,\nthe first step your computer does,\n\n1501\n01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,350\nit does what's called Spooling.\n\n1502\n01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,850\nIt takes what you're printing and\n\n1503\n01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:08,990\nit converts it into a format\nthe printer will recognize.\n\n1504\n01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:10,952\nIt does that right on your hard drive.\n\n1505\n01:16:10,952 --> 01:16:12,140\nAll right.\n\n1506\n01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:16,360\nAnd when it's done, it sends it over\nthe network or over the USB cable or over\n\n1507\n01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:20,450\nthe firewire cable to the printer, and\nit's in a format the printer recognizes.\n\n1508\n01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:22,870\nAnd here,\nwe're telling it what format to use.\n\n1509\n01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,850\nDo we want to use the print format,\nwhich is a standard from Apple?\n\n1510\n01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:30,090\nDo we want to use the HP format, which I\nknow for a fact will work on that printer?\n\n1511\n01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:33,860\nDo I want to use PostScript so\nI can get font guarantees.\n\n1512\n01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:35,440\nDo I do PCL?\n\n1513\n01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,070\nWhich is great for\nHP printers and some others.\n\n1514\n01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:41,030\nThat printer controlling,\nwhich you pick which one you want to use.\n\n1515\n01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:43,040\nAll right, I'll just stick\nwith AirPrint for right now.\n\n1516\n01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,470\nAnd I can go and hit Add,\nand add that printer.\n\n1517\n01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:50,110\nAll right, so there it goes,\nand see how it says setting up?\n\n1518\n01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:53,940\nSetting up means it's locating the right\ndriver, adding it to the system, and\n\n1519\n01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:55,080\npunching it in.\n\n1520\n01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,620\nAnd there's Tim's printer.\n\n1521\n01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,600\nRight?\nSo now I'm connected to Tim's printer,\n\n1522\n01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,010\nand I'm ready to print to it.\n\n1523\n01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:04,490\nNow, the printer might not be\non the same network as me.\n\n1524\n01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:06,080\nIt might be on a different network.\n\n1525\n01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,040\nAnd so when I go to hit that plus sign,\n\n1526\n01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,860\nit might not automatically\nfind it in the list.\n\n1527\n01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:14,740\nAnd if it's not in the list\nyou can add it yourself.\n\n1528\n01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:19,260\nI could choose IP and\nI can type in the IP address of a printer.\n\n1529\n01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:22,060\nI'll type in one here that's\non a different network.\n\n1530\n01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,410\nIt's gonna reach out to that printer and\n\n1531\n01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:25,550\nsee how it says gathering\nprinter information.\n\n1532\n01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,974\nIt's trying to figure out\nwhat that printer is.\n\n1533\n01:17:27,974 --> 01:17:28,900\nAll right?\n\n1534\n01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:32,330\nSo it tried to figure it out, and\nit really didn't do a very good job.\n\n1535\n01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:35,360\nIt's got a generic line printer daemon,\nor LPD connector.\n\n1536\n01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,380\nThat's a generic Unix type format for\nprinting.\n\n1537\n01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:42,120\nAnd then we've got the generic\nPostScript format that it's using.\n\n1538\n01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,720\nSo really pretty generic here.\n\n1539\n01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:49,060\nAnd if I hit Add, it's gonna add that\nprinter, so we'll give it a moment,\n\n1540\n01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:52,350\nthere it goes, and it says make sure\nthe options are accurately reflected,\n\n1541\n01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:56,470\nit picked up a duplexing unit, that means\nit can print on both sides of the paper.\n\n1542\n01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:59,360\nSo yeah, it does have that, so\nI'll go ahead and choose it,\n\n1543\n01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,710\nand it's gonna add it in.\n\n1544\n01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:02,670\nBut notice this printer.\n\n1545\n01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:06,740\nOn Tim's when I added it,\nit knew it was an HP LaserJet 400,\n\n1546\n01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:09,090\nit knew everything about that printer.\n\n1547\n01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:12,500\nThis other one that I added,\nit sees that its got a green light, but\n\n1548\n01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,550\nit doesn't know anything\nabout that printer.\n\n1549\n01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:18,130\nIt doesn't know what kind of a printer\nthat is, what functions it has.\n\n1550\n01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:19,990\nIt picked up the duplexing unit.\n\n1551\n01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:22,220\nBut that's about it, all right.\n\n1552\n01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:26,490\nSometimes the built in Apple\ndriver is not enough and\n\n1553\n01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:31,510\nin that scenario your gonna think\nabout get a driver for that printer.\n\n1554\n01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,890\nNow lets talk about printer drivers for\na minute.\n\n1555\n01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:37,640\nWhen Apple was running their own show with\ntheir own OS, right back in the OS9 and\n\n1556\n01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:41,210\nearlier days,\nthey have their own printing sub system.\n\n1557\n01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:43,880\nBut when they went to OS 10, right, OS X,\n\n1558\n01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:48,570\nwhen they went to that mode it was\nnow BSD and Unix under the hood.\n\n1559\n01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:52,080\nIn the Unix, Linux and BSD world,\nprinting was a nightmare.\n\n1560\n01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,960\nMost vendors did not make drivers for\ntheir printers.\n\n1561\n01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:59,530\nSo it was up to us to create these\ngeneric ones like the LPD systems.\n\n1562\n01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:01,200\nAnd it didn't work very well.\n\n1563\n01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,030\nAnd so Apple said that's a problem.\n\n1564\n01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:06,360\nAnd they looked around and they found\na company that created a product called\n\n1565\n01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:10,320\nCUPS, and\nCUPS is the Common Unix Printing System.\n\n1566\n01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:14,880\nAnd they had this kind of system that\nallowed you to build printer drivers, and\n\n1567\n01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:15,970\nApple liked it.\n\n1568\n01:19:15,970 --> 01:19:20,870\nIt was open source, so Apple could have\njust used it, but instead they bought it.\n\n1569\n01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:21,690\nThey bought that company,\n\n1570\n01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:24,630\nthe other company that was making this\nopen source product and they made it an in\n\n1571\n01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:29,430\nhouse project and now they have full\ntime developers that work just on cups.\n\n1572\n01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:33,480\nThey kept it open source, Apple's giving\nback to the Unix and Linux world and so\n\n1573\n01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:38,160\ntoday, almost every Linux\ndistribution uses CUPS,\n\n1574\n01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,680\nwhich is really managed by Apple.\n\n1575\n01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:42,230\nSo Apple revolutionized\nprinting in that Linux and\n\n1576\n01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:44,550\nUnix world they really\ndid a good thing there.\n\n1577\n01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:48,990\nAnd in turn we get actual drivers now.\n\n1578\n01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:52,831\nWhen a hardware manufacturer makes a new\nprinter, they'll make a Windows driver,\n\n1579\n01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:56,250\nthat's a given because you have Windows so\nheavily deployed in business.\n\n1580\n01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:59,578\nBut now they'll make a CUPS driver also,\nbecause if they do,\n\n1581\n01:19:59,578 --> 01:20:04,122\nthey know that driver will work on almost\nevery Linux distribution and in every Mac,\n\n1582\n01:20:04,122 --> 01:20:07,770\nand that's a pretty big deal,\nthey want to have that That footprint\n\n1583\n01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:11,500\nwith their driver so it makes life\na lot easier on the manufacturers.\n\n1584\n01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:15,354\nSo if I wanna use this printer to its\nfullest capabilities, I need to go out and\n\n1585\n01:20:15,354 --> 01:20:16,375\nget a driver for it.\n\n1586\n01:20:16,375 --> 01:20:19,250\nI need to get a CUPS compatible driver.\n\n1587\n01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:23,583\nNow CUPS uses these little files\nthat are called PPD files, right?\n\n1588\n01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:28,625\nAnd PPD,\nthat's the PostScript Printer Description.\n\n1589\n01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:32,925\nPost, not post print,\nPostScript Printer description.\n\n1590\n01:20:32,925 --> 01:20:35,587\nPostScript is one of the formats I\nmentioned earlier that lets us set\n\n1591\n01:20:35,587 --> 01:20:37,701\nthe fonts and all that stuff and\nwe print to a printer.\n\n1592\n01:20:37,701 --> 01:20:39,050\nIt works really well.\n\n1593\n01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:41,480\nWell, that's where\nthe PPD files came from.\n\n1594\n01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:45,220\nAnd back in the original cup days, that's\nall we had support for, was PostScript.\n\n1595\n01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,890\nBut since Apple took over\nthey've added a lot more.\n\n1596\n01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:49,920\nSo you're not just locked into PostScript.\n\n1597\n01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,030\nNow you can do air print, PCL,\nyou can do all sorts of other ones and\n\n1598\n01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:55,480\nit's still in a PPD file.\n\n1599\n01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:59,696\nThe names not really accurate anymore but\nwhen you want to get a printer driver for\n\n1600\n01:20:59,696 --> 01:21:02,368\nan Apple device you're looking for\nthat PPD file.\n\n1601\n01:21:02,368 --> 01:21:08,368\nSo this printer, I know for a fact that\nit's a Canon ImageRunner Advance 7065.\n\n1602\n01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:09,701\nThat's the model.\n\n1603\n01:21:09,701 --> 01:21:11,960\nSad that I know that,\nbut that's what it is.\n\n1604\n01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:16,240\nSo if I want the driver for it, I need\nto go to Canon's website and look and\n\n1605\n01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:20,690\nsee if they have a PPD for\nme that I can download and throw in here.\n\n1606\n01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:24,500\nSo I'll fire up Safari,\nI'm gonna go to Canon's website which\n\n1607\n01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:28,090\nI think is canonusa.com but I'll just\ngo to canon.com, see where I end up.\n\n1608\n01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,100\nApparently I need Flash, that's awesome.\n\n1609\n01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:35,980\nSo I want Support and North America.\n\n1610\n01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:41,970\nSo we're gonna browse in here and\nI'm basically just gonna look for\n\n1611\n01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:42,780\nthe driver for this.\n\n1612\n01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:47,368\nSo this is an office printer and\nI can see all the different things.\n\n1613\n01:21:47,368 --> 01:21:52,743\nIt's a color image runner advance and\nit is a C7065.\n\n1614\n01:21:52,743 --> 01:21:55,700\nSo I'll just find that here in the list,\nthere it is.\n\n1615\n01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:59,310\nYou'll see it's one of those gigantic\noffice printers it's a big deal.\n\n1616\n01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:02,140\nThere's a ton of features\navailable on this printer,\n\n1617\n01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:05,780\nyou wouldn't know it from\nlooking at my system preference.\n\n1618\n01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:09,540\nIt shows the picture of a little tiny\nprinter, and if I go into like options and\n\n1619\n01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:13,090\nsupplies there's not much\nin the way of options.\n\n1620\n01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:16,960\nIt picked up the duplexing unit and that's\nit, but this thing, it's got a stapler,\n\n1621\n01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,100\nit's got a hole puncher, it'll do\nthe dishes, it'll download files for\n\n1622\n01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,210\nyou from the internet.\n\n1623\n01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:23,230\nI think it's got a bit torque client,\nI don't even know.\n\n1624\n01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,560\nIt's got a ton of features.\n\n1625\n01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,290\nWe don't see any of that here.\n\n1626\n01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:31,180\nSo if I get the driver, that's what's\ngonna give me that functionality.\n\n1627\n01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:34,040\nSo when I go into the driver,\nthey make tons of different drivers.\n\n1628\n01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:37,010\nSo it detected that I'm on Yosemite.\n\n1629\n01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:40,940\nAnd if go under drivers, I can see these\ndifferent ones that are available.\n\n1630\n01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:43,050\nThey've got a PostScript driver for it.\n\n1631\n01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:47,980\nThey've get a PPD file right here for\nit, and I can see they got\n\n1632\n01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:51,070\ntheir universal driver that has\na lot of other software and stuff.\n\n1633\n01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:51,810\nI'm gonna get this PPD.\n\n1634\n01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:58,640\nSo it's got a little license agreement for\nme to sign off on, I'll do it.\n\n1635\n01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,550\nAnd now it's downloading\nin the background.\n\n1636\n01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,120\nAnd so if I go in here, here's that PPD.\n\n1637\n01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:07,290\nAnd notice it's pretty small, 1.1 MB.\n\n1638\n01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:10,150\nIf I had downloaded their bigger\nsoftware packages it's over 100 MB.\n\n1639\n01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:13,870\nIt's got a lot of other software in there\nfor doing things like fax and scanning.\n\n1640\n01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:15,740\nI don't care about that\nI just want to print.\n\n1641\n01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,020\nSo I just need that PPD file.\n\n1642\n01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:20,820\nSo if I open it up, what's inside of it?\n\n1643\n01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:23,240\nWell, just the PPD file usually.\n\n1644\n01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,420\nLet's see what's in this one.\n\n1645\n01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:25,890\nI haven't actually loaded this one,\nso I don't really know.\n\n1646\n01:23:25,890 --> 01:23:27,240\nWe'll find out right here.\n\n1647\n01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,920\nWell it actually looks like\nthere's a bunch of stuff in here.\n\n1648\n01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,450\nThis must be a generic PPD for\nall of their printers.\n\n1649\n01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:35,160\nSo I'm seeing a bunch\nof different printers.\n\n1650\n01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:40,660\nI need to look and\nsee if I can find the image runner C7065.\n\n1651\n01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:43,120\nThey haven't made this easy on me,\nhave they?\n\n1652\n01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:47,545\nSo it's an image runner advanced,\noh, this is annoying.\n\n1653\n01:23:47,545 --> 01:23:51,240\n[LAUGH] This is probably the most annoying\nway they could have structured all this.\n\n1654\n01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:55,840\nThere's an advance right there,\nand we gotta at least get close.\n\n1655\n01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,410\nOh, there we go.\n\n1656\n01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:59,740\nImage runner advanced C7055 and 7065,\nit's a shared drive for this one.\n\n1657\n01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:04,190\nAnd if I browse in there, I can see\nit has got a little zip for me and,\n\n1658\n01:24:04,190 --> 01:24:09,360\nif I extract that out we can look in there\nand, what we should see is the PPD file.\n\n1659\n01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,562\nThere is that printer.\n\n1660\n01:24:11,562 --> 01:24:15,040\nThe PostScript Printer description that\n\n1661\n01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,630\nfile defines how to\ninteract with the printer.\n\n1662\n01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:23,580\nNow that printer, that PPD file,\nwe load it into our system,\n\n1663\n01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,590\nand then we'll have a driver\nthat's ready to go with it.\n\n1664\n01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:26,161\nWhere does that go?\n\n1665\n01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:28,354\nWell, if I use their\nsoftware to do the install,\n\n1666\n01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:31,576\nit'll automatically put it there for\nme, but if I look in my terminal.\n\n1667\n01:24:33,826 --> 01:24:37,170\nThe place they go, it goes in\nthe Library like just about everything.\n\n1668\n01:24:37,170 --> 01:24:41,295\nIf I browse into /library/printers, so\n\n1669\n01:24:41,295 --> 01:24:48,080\nI'm in /libraries/printers,\nthat's where the PPD files go.\n\n1670\n01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,080\nAnd see how I've got\nthis Canon folder already\n\n1671\n01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:55,360\nwhere it's actually started\nto load certain things?\n\n1672\n01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,310\nSo it's got some kind of scanner present.\n\n1673\n01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:58,510\nThere's an Epson folder.\n\n1674\n01:24:58,510 --> 01:24:59,520\nI don't have any Epson equipment.\n\n1675\n01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,650\nThese are things that Apple has put in.\n\n1676\n01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:04,520\nBut there's a PPD folder.\n\n1677\n01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:09,250\nAnd if I look in there I'll\nsee contents and resources.\n\n1678\n01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:12,040\nI'm gonna kinda keep\nnavigating into this thing.\n\n1679\n01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:15,560\nAnd eventually you'll find these\nfiles where they've got other things.\n\n1680\n01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:19,960\nThere's PPD files, or here these\nare gzips, sorta archives that contain it.\n\n1681\n01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:22,060\nThese are ones that we've installed and\nadded.\n\n1682\n01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:29,118\nThere's also system ones in\n/System/Library/Printers.\n\n1683\n01:25:29,118 --> 01:25:32,996\nAnd if we look in here,\napparently we don't have any PPDs,\n\n1684\n01:25:32,996 --> 01:25:35,360\nI don't see any offhand.\n\n1685\n01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,330\nSo we can browse in here and\n\n1686\n01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:38,400\nyou can start to see some of\nthe other things that are available.\n\n1687\n01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,190\nI don't seem to have any printers here.\n\n1688\n01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:43,430\nBut I've got the PPD, so\nI can throw it into this folder.\n\n1689\n01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:44,660\nAnd I can start to use it.\n\n1690\n01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:46,370\nOr if I remember right,\nI think we can just double click on it.\n\n1691\n01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:49,410\nLet's test that theory out.\n\n1692\n01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:51,420\nNo, I guess you can't\njust double click it.\n\n1693\n01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:54,730\nBut if we need to load that PPD,\nwe can just throw it in that folder and\n\n1694\n01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:58,060\nnow it will be available and\nit will recognize that printer.\n\n1695\n01:25:58,060 --> 01:25:59,810\nIf I want the additional functionality,\n\n1696\n01:25:59,810 --> 01:26:03,610\nif I want the scanner and\nthe fax, the PPD is not enough.\n\n1697\n01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:04,150\nAll right.\n\n1698\n01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:06,880\nFor that,\nthat's where I need to go back and\n\n1699\n01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,920\ninstead of getting just the PPD\nfile I can come in here and\n\n1700\n01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:14,820\ngo to drivers and instead of just\ngetting that straight-up PPD.\n\n1701\n01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:19,060\nI can pull one of their other\ndrivers like this UFRII one, or\n\n1702\n01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:21,060\neven the PostScript one for Mac.\n\n1703\n01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:24,140\nIf we pull that one,\nit'll install a PPD also.\n\n1704\n01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:26,950\nBut it's gonna carry along\nwith it other software.\n\n1705\n01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:30,090\nLet me show you what I mean,\nas soon as that one finishes downloading,\n\n1706\n01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:31,910\nthen we'll see some of the other stuff.\n\n1707\n01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:35,535\nNow when you pull these,\nthey'll normally be PKG files, right?\n\n1708\n01:26:35,535 --> 01:26:40,365\nA package that runs and it will copy\nthe PPDs into the right place and\n\n1709\n01:26:40,365 --> 01:26:42,420\nmake them available.\n\n1710\n01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:45,480\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nopen up this PostScript one and\n\n1711\n01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,150\nthere is that Canon PostScript\ninstaller package.\n\n1712\n01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,890\nAnd when I run that it's gonna install\nit and that will take care of putting\n\n1713\n01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:55,130\nthe PPDs in the right place and\ngetting it registered with the system.\n\n1714\n01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:56,260\nAnd making them available.\n\n1715\n01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:58,060\nSo, I'll just agree to that.\n\n1716\n01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:00,170\nSee how it's 72 megs in size?\n\n1717\n01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:02,690\nConsiderably larger than just the PPD.\n\n1718\n01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:05,120\nThe PPD is the bare\nminimum of what I need.\n\n1719\n01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:09,160\nThis one's got more to enable some of the\nadditional functionalities of the system\n\n1720\n01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,510\nlike that scanner.\n\n1721\n01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:13,930\nThe scanner requires additional\nsoftware so, we've gotta have that.\n\n1722\n01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:16,740\nSo we'll go ahead and install that.\n\n1723\n01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,220\nAnd as soon as that's done,\n\n1724\n01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:22,110\nit's basically just copying\nthat PPD into the right place.\n\n1725\n01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:28,300\nWhen that's done,\nnow that the device should be recognized.\n\n1726\n01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:30,480\nOur system will know how\nto talk to a 7065 and\n\n1727\n01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:33,790\nit will see that that's a 7065 and,\nset up properly.\n\n1728\n01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:37,300\nI'll start to see things like\nthe hole-punching unit and all of that.\n\n1729\n01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:39,190\nSo when it's done,\nsee how it just says here to use it.\n\n1730\n01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:42,190\nGo ahead and add the printer you\nwanna use and you'll be in business.\n\n1731\n01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:43,590\nNow I've all ready added the printer.\n\n1732\n01:27:44,710 --> 01:27:49,210\nSo if I go back into my System\nPreferences, which apparently I closed, so\n\n1733\n01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:53,805\nI'll go back into my system preferences\nand the printer, I all ready added it.\n\n1734\n01:27:53,805 --> 01:27:58,215\nAnd so there it is and there's not\na lot I can do to it once it's added.\n\n1735\n01:27:58,215 --> 01:28:01,333\nIf I go into options and supplies,\nyou'll see here it's got the printer.\n\n1736\n01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:04,125\nIt doesn't really have where\nI can change that driver.\n\n1737\n01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:08,250\nThere is a way to do it but the easiest\nway is to just delete it, and re add it.\n\n1738\n01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:11,358\nAnd that'll redo the discovery,\nand when it re-does it,\n\n1739\n01:28:11,358 --> 01:28:14,167\nit should recognize it as\nthe full printer this time.\n\n1740\n01:28:14,167 --> 01:28:17,401\nSo if I repeat that process,\nI'll just hit the plus sign,\n\n1741\n01:28:17,401 --> 01:28:21,427\nI'll punch in the IP of that printer,\nand this time when it analyzes it,\n\n1742\n01:28:21,427 --> 01:28:23,910\nIt's got that Cannon driver loaded.\n\n1743\n01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:27,430\nAnd so it should see that, and\nrecognize what the printer is.\n\n1744\n01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:34,440\nAnd it doesn't look like mine did, so\nlet's see if we can't force it along.\n\n1745\n01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:37,300\nSo, here under use,\nit's got generic post script printer.\n\n1746\n01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,990\nI'm gonna drop that down and\nchoose select software.\n\n1747\n01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:40,970\nWhen you select software,\n\n1748\n01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:44,560\nit gives you the big list of\nall the PPDs you've got loaded.\n\n1749\n01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,050\nAnd I can look in here for\nthat driver that we just loaded.\n\n1750\n01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:50,130\nSo there's that Canon IR Advance 7065.\n\n1751\n01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:52,330\nSo I'm gonna choose that one.\n\n1752\n01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:56,840\nI'm just gonna force it along, and\nI'll rename that as our Office Printer.\n\n1753\n01:28:58,340 --> 01:28:58,970\nAnd we'll add it in.\n\n1754\n01:28:58,970 --> 01:29:02,710\nAll right, so\nthat's gonna get that one loaded.\n\n1755\n01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:06,490\nAnd once it's done,\nwhat I should see is recognizes it\n\n1756\n01:29:06,490 --> 01:29:09,120\nas something a little more\nadvanced than it did before, and\n\n1757\n01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,460\nwhen I go into it's options,\nI expect to see a lot more in here.\n\n1758\n01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:13,490\nThere we go.\n\n1759\n01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:15,510\nI don't just see the duplexer anymore.\n\n1760\n01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:19,225\nNow I see things like my\nExternal Hole Puncher, Paper Folding Unit,\n\n1761\n01:29:19,225 --> 01:29:22,260\nInsertion Unit, and\nit didn't automatically detect them.\n\n1762\n01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:23,820\nBut, at least I can turn them on.\n\n1763\n01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:25,440\nYes, we have a paper deck.\n\n1764\n01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,800\nAnd did I load the European one?\n\n1765\n01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:32,000\nIt's showing A1, well,\nwhatever, we'll go with that.\n\n1766\n01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,410\nI might have loaded the wrong locality.\n\n1767\n01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:36,642\nOh no, they just call it A1, B1, whatever.\n\n1768\n01:29:36,642 --> 01:29:40,290\nAll right, so we have a staple finisher,\nwe have an External two and\n\n1769\n01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:41,430\nthree hole puncher.\n\n1770\n01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:45,990\nSo I can punch in those values, and\nnow it'll be able to use those.\n\n1771\n01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:49,460\nSo now it's gonna understand that and\nwe can set what papers in each tray and\n\n1772\n01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:50,670\nall that good stuff.\n\n1773\n01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:55,330\nAnd now, I can really get\nthe full utility of that printer.\n\n1774\n01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:56,520\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n1775\n01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:59,430\nThe built in Apple drivers,\nthey'll typically work.\n\n1776\n01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:02,530\nThey'll enable you to do single\nsided printing at a minimum.\n\n1777\n01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:05,930\nBut, you'll probably need a load\nup driver from the vendor\n\n1778\n01:30:05,930 --> 01:30:07,300\nto actually get it up and going.\n\n1779\n01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:11,930\nAll right, so once that's in place,\nwe're pretty much done,\n\n1780\n01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:15,390\nbut there's one extra thing that\nwe need to know about printers,\n\n1781\n01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:18,260\nwhich is why they call it out\nspecifically for the exam.\n\n1782\n01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:21,000\nNow that I've added this\nprinter to my computer,\n\n1783\n01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,470\nI might wanna share it out with the other\npeople that are here in the office, so\n\n1784\n01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:26,710\nthat they don't have to go\nthrough what I just did, right?\n\n1785\n01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:27,480\nInstead of dealing with that,\n\n1786\n01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:31,900\nthey can just point right to me and I'll\nsend it to the printer for them, right?\n\n1787\n01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:35,800\nAnd you see that option right here on the\nscreen, share this printer on the network.\n\n1788\n01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,200\nYou can share the printer on\nthe network two different ways.\n\n1789\n01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,180\nThis is one way,\nwhen I come right into here and\n\n1790\n01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:44,800\nI check off share this\nprinter on the network.\n\n1791\n01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,680\nYou check it off and\nnow it's being shared.\n\n1792\n01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,920\nBut it's gonna share it with\nthe default permissions.\n\n1793\n01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,080\nIf you're fine with the default permission\nwhich just lets everybody print,\n\n1794\n01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:53,640\nthen that's all you do.\n\n1795\n01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,190\nYou check it off and you share it.\n\n1796\n01:30:55,190 --> 01:30:59,400\nSo I went into system preferences,\nand then into printers and scanners.\n\n1797\n01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,680\nShows the printer, and check off\nshare this printer on the network.\n\n1798\n01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,160\nThe other way to share it,\n\n1799\n01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:09,810\nlike if I uncheck that,\nis you go to your system preferences.\n\n1800\n01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:13,610\nAnd instead of going to printers and\nscanners, you go down to sharing.\n\n1801\n01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:17,750\nInside of sharing,\nyou can turn on printer sharing.\n\n1802\n01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:20,080\nYou can pick the printer.\n\n1803\n01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:23,660\nAnd the only difference between here and\n\n1804\n01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:29,320\nthe other place is once you turn it on,\nyou can customize the print permissions.\n\n1805\n01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:33,770\nMaybe I don't want everyone to print,\nmaybe I want to limit that now.\n\n1806\n01:31:33,770 --> 01:31:37,880\nSo I can add it in and maybe,\nI just want me to be able to print.\n\n1807\n01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:40,630\nAnd so I can take everyone and\nset it to no access.\n\n1808\n01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:42,690\nAnd me, I get full access.\n\n1809\n01:31:42,690 --> 01:31:45,480\nSo now, if I'm on somebody else's\ncomputer here in the office,\n\n1810\n01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:49,370\nI can connect to this printer, and\nI can print but other people can't.\n\n1811\n01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:51,560\nSo if you want to\ncustomize the permissions,\n\n1812\n01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,910\nyou need to go to the sharing preference.\n\n1813\n01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:56,600\nBut if you just want to share it out and\nlet everybody print, you can do that\n\n1814\n01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,975\nright from the printers and scanners\npreference, you can set it right in there.\n\n1815\n01:31:59,975 --> 01:32:02,110\nRight, and in fact,\nif I went the other way,\n\n1816\n01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:05,130\nnotice how they have links,\nlike here's this link, open printers and\n\n1817\n01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:08,070\nscanners preference,\nwe saw the same thing under the other one.\n\n1818\n01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:11,550\nIf I go to the printer and\nscanner preferences, and\n\n1819\n01:32:11,550 --> 01:32:13,830\nI choose the printer, it's got\na link to the sharing preferences.\n\n1820\n01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:15,790\nThe two tools link together.\n\n1821\n01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:17,910\nBecause they know you might\nneed to go back and forth.\n\n1822\n01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:21,390\nI turn on the sharing here, then I\njump over to sharing preferences, and\n\n1823\n01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:22,660\nI set the permissions.\n\n1824\n01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:24,760\nAnd then I jump back to printers and\nscanners, and\n\n1825\n01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,420\nI configure the printer some more, right?\n\n1826\n01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:28,930\nSo they link to each other for\nthat exact purpose.\n\n1827\n01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:30,480\nBut that's how we share those out.\n\n1828\n01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,210\nOnce it's shared, people on\nthe network can just browse, they see\n\n1829\n01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:36,160\nthe printer, and they can print to it, and\nthey don't have to mess with all the stuff\n\n1830\n01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,960\nthat we just did as far as loading\nthe driver and getting that all set up.\n\n1831\n01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:42,750\nThey'll learn all that from My Mac, My Mac\nwill tell them what the printer is and\n\n1832\n01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:46,710\nwhat format it uses and they just need to\ntalk to me and not the printer itself.\n\n1833\n01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:50,320\nSo if I say, hey you gotta give\nme files in postscript format,\n\n1834\n01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,970\nthey just need that\ngeneric postscript driver.\n\n1835\n01:32:52,970 --> 01:32:55,880\nOr if I needed an airprint,\nthey can send it to me in airprint.\n\n1836\n01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:58,280\nAnd then I can turn it into PCL or\n\n1837\n01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:02,090\nwhatever to send it along to that printer\nand get it to print out on the other end.\n\n1838\n01:33:02,090 --> 01:33:03,700\nSo it makes things a lot more simple.\n\n1839\n01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:07,430\nAll right, but\nthat's basically it for printers.\n\n1840\n01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:11,540\nNow I had to manually add this one in\nbecause it was on a different network.\n\n1841\n01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:13,870\nTim's, it automatically found\nthat one on the network, right?\n\n1842\n01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:15,230\nSo it just located it.\n\n1843\n01:33:15,230 --> 01:33:17,530\nAnd I don't have Tim's driver loaded, so\n\n1844\n01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:19,960\nI might need to go and add a driver for\nhis too if I wanna get.\n\n1845\n01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:23,120\nI don't see, I don't even get\nan Options button on this one.\n\n1846\n01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,880\nSo I would need to load the driver for\nhis too.\n\n1847\n01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:29,610\nIf we directly plug the cable in,\nwe wouldn't have to use the plus button,\n\n1848\n01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:31,980\nit would automatically spot it,\nsee it, and add it in.\n\n1849\n01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:34,010\nSo we'd have one less step there\nwith the direct attach printer.\n\n1850\n01:33:35,782 --> 01:33:37,505\nAll right, but\nthat's about It for printers,\n\n1851\n01:33:37,505 --> 01:33:40,345\nnot the craziest thing in the world,\npretty straightforward.\n\n1852\n01:33:40,345 --> 01:33:46,285\nThe exam, remember, the underlying system\nis CUPS, the Common Unix Print System.\n\n1853\n01:33:46,285 --> 01:33:47,235\nIt's pretty neat.\n\n1854\n01:33:47,235 --> 01:33:50,590\nIt's one of the better things that Apple's\ndone for the open source community.\n\n1855\n01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:54,400\nThere's one other thing I wanna mention,\nI mention that when we print to a printer,\n\n1856\n01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:58,200\nit takes those documents has to put them\nin a format the printer will understand,\n\n1857\n01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,940\nand it does that on your hard drive, okay?\n\n1858\n01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:03,960\nWell it does that in\na folder that's protected.\n\n1859\n01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:07,360\nSo, I wanna point that out to you guys\ncuz it's not a common one you encounter.\n\n1860\n01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:11,390\nAnd this can turn up on the exam,\nit's not terribly likely, but it can.\n\n1861\n01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:14,850\nThe printer, when it generates\nthose temporary documents,\n\n1862\n01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:20,816\nit puts them in a folder which is /var,\n\n1863\n01:34:20,816 --> 01:34:25,810\nvar, that's a hidden folder anyway,\nwe don't normally see that one.\n\n1864\n01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:31,860\n/var/spool/cups.\n\n1865\n01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:34,560\nThat's the folder where your\ntemporary print jobs are going.\n\n1866\n01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,770\nAnd if you ever try and browse to it,\nyou get permission denied.\n\n1867\n01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:40,120\nRight, it's a secured folder.\n\n1868\n01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:45,070\nThey want to make sure that each user\ncan't see each other's print jobs.\n\n1869\n01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:47,340\nIf I had a secret document, and\nI don't want anybody else to see it,\n\n1870\n01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:50,380\nand I print it, and\na copy of it gets stuck in the spooler.\n\n1871\n01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:53,860\nLike, the printer's offline,\nif somebody else could access the spooler,\n\n1872\n01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:55,350\nthey could see what I was printing.\n\n1873\n01:34:55,350 --> 01:35:00,200\nSo it's secured, it's isolated, and\nyou're not able to get to it, right?\n\n1874\n01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,400\nIf you want to see\nwhat's inside it though,\n\n1875\n01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:04,300\nyou can jump over to like, an admin shell.\n\n1876\n01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:07,370\nI'm just gonna do that real quick.\n\n1877\n01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:09,370\nYou're not supposed to do this,\nApple doesn't quite like it.\n\n1878\n01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:13,990\nBut if we want to see what's in there,\nwe can browse to it here, and\n\n1879\n01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:15,190\nnow we can browse inside.\n\n1880\n01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:19,210\nAnd what you'll see are folders for each\nof the printers that have been created.\n\n1881\n01:35:19,210 --> 01:35:21,950\nNow, these folders don't mean anything\nto us because we're not supposed to\n\n1882\n01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:22,500\nsee them, right?\n\n1883\n01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,350\nThe system is keeping track of that.\n\n1884\n01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:28,570\nAnd there's a cache, see that cache\nright there, where print jobs and\n\n1885\n01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:30,060\nother things can get stored.\n\n1886\n01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:32,760\nHere's that image that it\nwas using of Tim's printer.\n\n1887\n01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,490\nThere's some officer printer data.\n\n1888\n01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:36,290\nThere's things that get\ncached in there that again,\n\n1889\n01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:38,780\nyou might not want other\npeople to have access to.\n\n1890\n01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:45,155\nAnd if I take a look at one\nof these other folders, or\n\n1891\n01:35:45,155 --> 01:35:47,945\nactually that's just a raw file, isn't it?\n\n1892\n01:35:47,945 --> 01:35:48,855\nThat one is.\n\n1893\n01:35:48,855 --> 01:35:51,915\nI've got my cache, I've got my temp,\nand I guess I've never printed so\n\n1894\n01:35:51,915 --> 01:35:53,695\nsome of the folders haven't been created.\n\n1895\n01:35:53,695 --> 01:35:59,095\nBut you can browse in here and see some of\nthe different things that have been made.\n\n1896\n01:35:59,095 --> 01:36:01,350\nI don't really have all that\nmuch to see in this one, do I?\n\n1897\n01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:04,380\nBut this is where those\ntemporary jobs get cached and\n\n1898\n01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:06,720\nstored, until they make it to the printer.\n\n1899\n01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,890\nIf the printer's offline,\nthey'll sit there.\n\n1900\n01:36:08,890 --> 01:36:10,060\nAnd that's where the risk occurs.\n\n1901\n01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:13,890\nThat's why Apple secures this location and\ndoesn't let you get to it.\n\n1902\n01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:18,310\nBut it's just /var/spool/cups.\n\n1903\n01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:19,210\nYou should never have to go there.\n\n1904\n01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:23,830\nAll right, well,\nthat's about all I've got on printers,\n\n1905\n01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:26,960\nand really about all I've got on\nperipheral devices as a whole.\n\n1906\n01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,340\nSo this is a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap this show up.\n\n1907\n01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:33,320\nLet me remind you guys,\nif you have questions on any\n\n1908\n01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:38,010\nof the different things that we've talked\nabout in this show, feel free to ask.\n\n1909\n01:36:38,010 -->

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,250\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,718\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n7\n00:00:40,718 --> 00:00:45,000\nback again with another episode of\nApple Certified Support Professional.\n\n8\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,371\nIn fact,\nwe're not just back with another episode,\n\n9\n00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:51,190\nwe're back with the final episode of this\nseries as we wind down the objectives.\n\n10\n00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,730\nWe're on the final one and\n\n11\n00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,620\nin this episode we're going to take\na look at some stuff that is really cool.\n\n12\n00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,110\nThe whole title of this series is\nthe Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n13\n00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,180\nAnd that means that you're going\nto be dealing with systems that\n\n14\n00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,760\naren't necessarily working\nthe way they're supposed to.\n\n15\n00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,360\nWe've seen a ton of things throughout\nthe series that showed how to configure\n\n16\n00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,010\noptions, and\nchange the way the Mac OS behaves.\n\n17\n00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,080\nIn this episode,\n\n18\n00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,480\nwe're going to take a look at what to\ndo when Mac OS isn't even working.\n\n19\n00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,090\nWhen you can't boot, or\nyou can't login, when you're just\n\n20\n00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,930\nstuck trying to get into the system at\nall, better yet go and configure settings.\n\n21\n00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,225\nSo we're going to see some neat stuff,\nand these are the tools that\n\n22\n00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:32,110\nkinda become our mental toolkit,\nfor when we work on computers.\n\n23\n00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,980\nNow, Apple has put a lot of\n\n24\n00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,640\nreally neat Troubleshooting Utilities\ninto the Operating System and\n\n25\n00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,300\nthe hardware itself, most of which\nis hidden away from the users.\n\n26\n00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,003\nWe've seen lot of things like the\nNetwork Utility, and System Information,\n\n27\n00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:50,490\nDisk Utility, Recovery Mode, all that\nstuff we've covered in other episodes.\n\n28\n00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,460\nIt's all there, it's already to use,\nif you know about it.\n\n29\n00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,230\nIf you don't know about it, it's hard to\nstumble across those utilities, right?\n\n30\n00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,690\nYou don't necessarily see them,\nthey're kind of out of our purview.\n\n31\n00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,810\nBut a lot of that stuff, you can only\naccess assuming your Mac will boot up.\n\n32\n00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,990\nBut what if your Mac won't even boot up?\n\n33\n00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,100\nWhat if it won't even get that far?\n\n34\n00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,600\nWell, then you've gotta take\nsome extra steps, and try, and\n\n35\n00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,200\nsee what you can do to correct it.\n\n36\n00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,880\nWell, to understand how to\ntroubleshoot boot problems,\n\n37\n00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,000\nwe need to understand what\nhappens at boot time anyway.\n\n38\n00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,350\nWhen you press the power\nbutton on your Mac,\n\n39\n00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,810\nthere's actually four stages that\nwe go through as it boots up.\n\n40\n00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,010\nIt does a couple of different\nthings during that process, and\n\n41\n00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,240\nI want to show that to you.\n\n42\n00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,160\nI want to walk you through the process,\nand so we're gonna be using another Mac.\n\n43\n00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,440\nNormally, I'd use my laptop for this,\nbut because we're gonna be doing some\n\n44\n00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,910\ntroubleshooting, I'm gonna\nuse a separate Mac today.\n\n45\n00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,930\nSo I've got a Mac mini that's\noff camera here, and this is it,\n\n46\n00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,210\nwe're looking at it right here.\n\n47\n00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,480\nAnd it's running Yosemite.\n\n48\n00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,338\nIt's a perfectly healthy machine,\nit's up, and it's running and it's happy.\n\n49\n00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,500\nBut I wanna walk through\nthe boot process and show you,\n\n50\n00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,610\nwhat's going on at each stage.\n\n51\n00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,100\nSo let me just give this\nguy a quick restart.\n\n52\n00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,100\nSo we'll go ahead and restart that one,\nand while it reboots, there we go, we're\n\n53\n00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,690\njust gonna let it reboot, it's gonna go to\na black screen and it's gonna power off.\n\n54\n00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,150\nThen it's gonna power back\non cuz I told it to restart.\n\n55\n00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,330\nAnd when the power's on,\nyou'll see a black screen for a moment.\n\n56\n00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:19,260\nAnd that black screen is it going\nthrough its basic firmware process.\n\n57\n00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,880\nThen it goes to a grey screen,\nwith a grey Apple on it.\n\n58\n00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,041\nAnd that's when it's\nstarting to do it's booter,\n\n59\n00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:28,540\nwhen it's trying to find out where\nit's going to boot from, all right.\n\n60\n00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,200\nThen you get this screen right here,\n\n61\n00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,410\nwhich is a gray Apple with\na status bar at the bottom.\n\n62\n00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,330\nAnd this is the Kernel kicking in for\nthe Operating System,\n\n63\n00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,460\nstarting to do its activities.\n\n64\n00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,490\nAnd then once that's done, it's gonna\ntransition us to a login window,\n\n65\n00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,660\nall right?\n\n66\n00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,070\nThose are the four steps that\nhappens when a Mac boots up.\n\n67\n00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,210\nThe firmware,\nwhich is when we have the black screen.\n\n68\n00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,130\nThen we get the booter, which is when\nwe have the gray screen with an Apple.\n\n69\n00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,130\nThen we have the kernel, which is the gray\nscreen with an Apple, and the loading bar.\n\n70\n00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,670\nAnd then we have the login\nwindow right here.\n\n71\n00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,820\nThose four steps.\n\n72\n00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,550\nIf your Mac is failing to boot, it's\ngonna fail in one of those four phases.\n\n73\n00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,367\nIf you can get to the login window\nlike this, typically things are fine.\n\n74\n00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:17,710\nTypically things are working out okay.\n\n75\n00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,590\nAnd if you can log in as a user, so\nlike if I try to log in as ITProTV here.\n\n76\n00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,660\nLet's see if I can remember that password.\n\n77\n00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,780\nMaybe I do.\nThere we go, all right.\n\n78\n00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,550\nIf you can get to that spot,\nthings are pretty fine, right?\n\n79\n00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,020\nIf you can get to that spot and\nyou can't log in as a user.\n\n80\n00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,420\nIf you've forgotten the password.\n\n81\n00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,520\nOr if you go to log in and\nthe Mac crashes and it shuts down.\n\n82\n00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,870\nWell those are typically\nsoftware problems.\n\n83\n00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,630\nThose are problems with that user account,\nright?\n\n84\n00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,670\nThe user account that you'd just\nlog in as, oh that's our chat room,\n\n85\n00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,890\nlet me get that out of the way.\n\n86\n00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,570\nThere we go.\n\n87\n00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,800\nSo those are usually just problems\nwith the user account, and\n\n88\n00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,440\nthose can be solved by logging\nin as a different user.\n\n89\n00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,020\nIt's pretty straightforward and I'll talk\na little bit more about that later on.\n\n90\n00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,170\nBut if you can't even get to\nthe login window, what do you do?\n\n91\n00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,630\nLet's talk about each of those\nfour phases and what's happening.\n\n92\n00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,256\nThe very first phase when I booted,\nwas that I got a black screen, right?\n\n93\n00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:14,860\nAnd that black screen was the firmware.\n\n94\n00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,410\nNow, what is the firmware?\n\n95\n00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,190\nWell, on the mother board for that Mac,\nin this case it was the Mac Mini, but\n\n96\n00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,810\nit would be the same for my laptop, or\nMacBook Pro, or any thing like that.\n\n97\n00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,390\nOn that mother board, you have what\na lot of people call a Bios Chip, but\n\n98\n00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,360\nApple refers to as their firmware because\nthey have a custom firmware that written.\n\n99\n00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,970\nAnd that firmware, is what's responsible\nfor powering on the hardware.\n\n100\n00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,410\nWhen you push that power button,\nthe firmware's what wakes up all of your\n\n101\n00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,540\nhardware, and says, hey, the hardware\nneeds electricity, so it can spin up.\n\n102\n00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,180\nThe CPU needs electricity so\nit can power on.\n\n103\n00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,220\nThe memory needs electricity, and the CPU\nneeds to be allowed to talk to it, right.\n\n104\n00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,440\nThat's what your firmware is doing.\n\n105\n00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,790\nWhile it's doing that,\nit does what's called a post check.\n\n106\n00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,935\nOr a power on self test.\n\n107\n00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:59,200\nAnd the power on self test,\nis we just start testing\n\n108\n00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,970\nall the different hardware pieces,\nto make sure they're functioning.\n\n109\n00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,830\nThe system says, hey,\nI need to power on a video card.\n\n110\n00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,320\nWell, if the video card won't power on,\nwe got a problem.\n\n111\n00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,370\nSo, that's a pretty good indicator\nthat we've got some failure there.\n\n112\n00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,580\nIf it can't power on the video card,\nif it can't find the video card.\n\n113\n00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,440\nBut if it can't find the video card.\n\n114\n00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,010\nAnd we get some error.\n\n115\n00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,034\nWhat can the Mac tell us?\n\n116\n00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:18,810\nIt can't tell us much.\n\n117\n00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,190\nIt can't tell us much at all,\nbecause it couldn't find a video card.\n\n118\n00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,550\nIt's not like it can\ndisplay an error message.\n\n119\n00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,970\nSo, at a firmware stage, it can be very\ndifficult to troubleshoot an error, right?\n\n120\n00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,140\nWhat'll normally happen,\n\n121\n00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:37,080\nwhen you have an error at that stage,\nit's almost always a hardware problem.\n\n122\n00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,970\nSo we can't even get in to our software.\n\n123\n00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,660\nWe can't even boot from recovery.\n\n124\n00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,540\nYou can't even boot from removable media.\n\n125\n00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,220\nYou've got a hardware problem.\n\n126\n00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,540\nYour video card failed.\n\n127\n00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,895\nYour memory's failing.\n\n128\n00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:49,130\nYour CPU has failed, something like that.\n\n129\n00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,030\nAnd so what the mac will do,\n\n130\n00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,160\nis it'll default to a different\nway of reporting the error.\n\n131\n00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,650\nIf you have a hardware error like that,\nyou'll get one of two, or\n\n132\n00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,630\npossibly both, types of messaging.\n\n133\n00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,650\nThe first form of messaging is the sound.\n\n134\n00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,780\nAn audible beep.\n\n135\n00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,352\nAnd Apple calls them Beep Codes, so\n\n136\n00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:10,395\nwhen you power on the Mac,\nyou just start to hear [SOUND].\n\n137\n00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:11,820\nOr something like that.\n\n138\n00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,570\nIt will be a pattern,\nlong beeps and short beeps.\n\n139\n00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,496\nYou might hear beep, beep just like\nthat or you might hear beep-beep,\n\n140\n00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:23,920\nbeep-beep, different combinations there\nand each combination means something.\n\n141\n00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,260\nYou can actually pull it up on the Apple\nservice manual, if you want, and\n\n142\n00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,500\nyou can actually find out what\neach of those Beep Codes mean.\n\n143\n00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,566\nBut at this level, at the ACSP level,\n\n144\n00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:33,898\nit doesn't really matter\nwhat the Beep Code means,\n\n145\n00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:37,870\nbecause regardless of the result, it\nmeans your system needs hardware service.\n\n146\n00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,300\nIf you're getting Beep Code like that,\n\n147\n00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,350\nyou're more than likely gonna need to\ntake it down to Apple for repair, or\n\n148\n00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,680\ndo a warrantee exchange, whatever it\nis you have for covering that unit.\n\n149\n00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,290\nIt's gonna have to have repairs.\n\n150\n00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,250\nThere are some times\nwhen you can avoid that.\n\n151\n00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,440\nFor example,\nlike this Mac Mini in particular.\n\n152\n00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,750\nThis Mac Mini is last year's version.\n\n153\n00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,292\nAnd so\nit still has removable memory in it.\n\n154\n00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,290\nIf some of the memory became loose.\n\n155\n00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,375\nMaybe I was moving the unit around and\na little memory chip became loose.\n\n156\n00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,333\nWell, that could cause\na beep code when it boots.\n\n157\n00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,292\nIt can't find RAM, can't boot up.\n\n158\n00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,934\nSo, I might be able to just\nundo the bottom cover and\n\n159\n00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:12,680\ntighten those memory sticks.\n\n160\n00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,672\nTake them out and put them back out.\n\n161\n00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:16,610\nThey call reseating the memory, and\nthat might fix the problem right there and\n\n162\n00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,145\nI didn't have to I have\nto do a warranty call.\n\n163\n00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:19,605\nI have to do maintenance on it.\n\n164\n00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:21,955\nJust pop the chip out and pop it back in.\n\n165\n00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:26,385\nOr, it could be that a hard drive cable\ncame loose, it's unlikely in a Mac Mini,\n\n166\n00:08:26,385 --> 00:08:30,565\nbut it's possible in a Mac Pro or one of\nthe bigger Macs, you could have that.\n\n167\n00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:33,085\nSo you've checked the normal things.\n\n168\n00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:34,935\nYou've checked to make sure\nyour cables are seated,\n\n169\n00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:38,075\nyour cards are inserted properly,\nyou checked all those things.\n\n170\n00:08:38,075 --> 00:08:40,815\nAnother thing to try is to\nunhook all of your peripherals.\n\n171\n00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,200\nIf you've got a FireWire camera hooked up,\nand a USB hard drive, and\n\n172\n00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,520\na ThunderBolt monitor,\nunhook all that stuff.\n\n173\n00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,630\nUnhook everything except for the basics.\n\n174\n00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,190\nKeyboard, mouse, monitor.\n\n175\n00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,630\nAnd try and power it on then.\n\n176\n00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,730\nIt could be a peripheral\nthat's causing the problem.\n\n177\n00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,090\nAnd that's a quick and\neasy way to test it.\n\n178\n00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,580\nBut if you do that and you're still\ngetting a beep code then that means you do\n\n179\n00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,050\nhave some kind of hardware issue\ninside of the unit itself, and\n\n180\n00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,510\nyou may not be able to fix that.\n\n181\n00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,030\nYou'll probably have to go in for\nwarranty.\n\n182\n00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,550\nSometimes you don't get a beep code.\n\n183\n00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,760\nSometimes the problem\nis with the sound card.\n\n184\n00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,590\nIt's not able to generate those beeps and\n\n185\n00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,910\nin those scenarios instead of a beep code,\nyou'll get a visual code.\n\n186\n00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,920\nThe power button on the Mac will flash,\nall right?\n\n187\n00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,730\nNormally, when you hit the power,\nthe power button lights up and\n\n188\n00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,040\njust stays lit up the whole rest\nof the time the Mac has booted.\n\n189\n00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,200\nAnd if it goes to sleep, right, it does\nthat dim kind of fade in, fade out thing.\n\n190\n00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,900\nBut if you power on the Mac, and\n\n191\n00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,840\nit can't generate an audio beep code,\nit'll flash the power light instead.\n\n192\n00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,790\nSo, you'll have short flashes and\nlong flashes and\n\n193\n00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,130\nthose are indicating the same\ntypes of codes as the audio beeps.\n\n194\n00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,700\nAnd you can use those visual codes\nto be able to decipher what's\n\n195\n00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,830\nwrong with the Mac.\n\n196\n00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,720\nYou can go to Apple's website and\npull the service manual for your Mac and\n\n197\n00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,620\nit'll tell you what those codes mean.\n\n198\n00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,070\nBut it's the same thing as the audio\ncodes, it doesn't really matter because\n\n199\n00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,640\nwhatever's wrong is usually going\nto require hardware service.\n\n200\n00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,970\nReseat your cables, reseat your cards,\nsee if that fixes it.\n\n201\n00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:11,130\nIf it doesn't, you've got\na maintenance call in your future.\n\n202\n00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,985\nThat process, the firmware booting up,\nwhen it loads,\n\n203\n00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:16,985\nwhat it's loading is what\nis called the Bootrom.\n\n204\n00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:19,115\nSo you'll hear people\ntalk about the Bootrom.\n\n205\n00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:23,025\nAnd the Bootrom is that really,\nreally tiny operating system that\n\n206\n00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:26,915\njust does basic things like powers on the\nhardware, gets the system up and running.\n\n207\n00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:28,845\nAnd every Mac has its own Bootrom.\n\n208\n00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:32,095\nAnd the Bootrom does actually\n\n209\n00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:36,090\nhave some neat utilities built into it\nthat allow us to check our systems.\n\n210\n00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,260\nOne of the neatest ones,\n\n211\n00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,020\none that a lot of people don't know\nabout is the Apple hardware diagnostics.\n\n212\n00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,910\nIt is a hardware diagnostic built into\npretty much every Mac that you can access.\n\n213\n00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,000\nBut it's access to a hidden menu.\n\n214\n00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,080\nAnd we're gonna see some of\nthese throughout the day.\n\n215\n00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,590\nIs that we got a number of shortcut\ncombinations that we can do while our Mac\n\n216\n00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,299\nboots that changes what it does.\n\n217\n00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,260\nSo if I'm not even getting past\nthat initial black screen,\n\n218\n00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,640\nI never see an Apple logo up on my screen,\nI've got a problem and\n\n219\n00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,110\nusually the first thing I'll try\nare those hardware diagnostics.\n\n220\n00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,510\nNow, if it's a video card problem, you're\nnot gonna be able to get to the hardware\n\n221\n00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,560\ndiagnostics, but if it's something else,\nyou usually will.\n\n222\n00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,250\nYou'll be able to get to it and\nhopefully test to see what the problem is.\n\n223\n00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,170\nIf you wanna see the hardware diagnostics,\nit's pretty neat.\n\n224\n00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,310\nLet me bring this other Mac back up,\nand what I'm going to do is,\n\n225\n00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,520\nI'm going to go ahead and,\nlet's see, how do I want to do this.\n\n226\n00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,180\nNormally what I would do is shut\nit down and power it off, but\n\n227\n00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,290\nthe unit is way over there.\n\n228\n00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,960\nActually, you know what,\nI'm gonna task Nate on this one.\n\n229\n00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,650\nI'm gonna shut this unit down,\nand so it's gonna power off.\n\n230\n00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,280\nNate, I'm going to need a favor from you,\nwhen you see the power light go off,\n\n231\n00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,050\ncan you press the power button, and let\nme know when you press that power button.\n\n232\n00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,780\nWhat I'm going to do is when\nNate presses that power button,\n\n233\n00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,610\nI'm going to hold down\nthe letter D on my keyboard.\n\n234\n00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,312\nSo I'm just waiting for him to do that.\n\n235\n00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:57,890\nAll right so, it's gonna come up, and\n\n236\n00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,380\nwhat we're gonna see is this\ngray screen right here.\n\n237\n00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,270\nI'm holding D on my keyboard, and\n\n238\n00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,760\nthat's gonna cause it to load\nthe Apple hardware diagnostics.\n\n239\n00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,370\nSo we should see, there we go, so\nwe get a little screen there, and\n\n240\n00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,640\nnow it's asking me what\nlanguage I wanna speak today.\n\n241\n00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,670\nSo here's my Apple hardware test, and it's\nasking for a little bit of information.\n\n242\n00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,460\nIf you run this on one\nof the newer Mac Books\n\n243\n00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,910\nthe screen looks a little bit different.\n\n244\n00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,480\nIt actually hides a lot of this stuff.\n\n245\n00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,030\nBut on a Mac Mini like this one,\nit lets me pick the language and\n\n246\n00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,850\nI can do an interactive test.\n\n247\n00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,410\nOn the Mac Books, it just\nimmediately goes right into a test.\n\n248\n00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,320\nYou'll see a little status bar and\nit says takes approximately four minutes.\n\n249\n00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,200\nAnd it'll run about four minutes.\n\n250\n00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,610\nOn the desktops, though,\nit's a lot more powerful.\n\n251\n00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,580\nSo what I can see here is my menu,\nand I'll just pick my language here,\n\n252\n00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,400\nI'll go English on mine,\nand I'll move forward.\n\n253\n00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,260\nIt's going to probe for\nthe hardware in my system and\n\n254\n00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,020\nonce it's found the hardware,\nnow I can run the test.\n\n255\n00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,570\nRight?\nSo\n\n256\n00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,370\nit's just doing a quick scan to see and\ntell.\n\n257\n00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,670\nSee how it's telling me no tests can\nbe run until the probe is completed?\n\n258\n00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,190\nSo I just need to sit tight.\n\n259\n00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,990\nThere we go, now it's probed my hardware.\n\n260\n00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,660\nAll right.\n\n261\n00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,030\nAnd so we can perform a basic\ntest with this button.\n\n262\n00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,620\nOr we can do an extended test right here.\n\n263\n00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,390\nAnd it'll run a lot of additional\ntests against the system.\n\n264\n00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,050\nLike it'll test every sector of\nthe hard drive which takes a long time.\n\n265\n00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,480\nIt takes hours to run that one.\n\n266\n00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,690\nThe basic test on the other hand usually\ntakes three to five minutes, and\n\n267\n00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,380\nsee how just telling us there,\nthree minutes or longer.\n\n268\n00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,890\nUnder Hardware Profile,\nI can see the hardware that it found.\n\n269\n00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,150\nSo if I think it's missing something,\nif it didn't detect something properly,\n\n270\n00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,690\nI can look in here and see.\n\n271\n00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:36,030\nSo it's showing that I've got eight\ngigs of memory as two four-gig sticks.\n\n272\n00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,300\nBut if I know that it should\nhave 16 gigs of memory\n\n273\n00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,110\nThat tells me some of my\nmemory's not showing up.\n\n274\n00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,890\nMaybe I've got a loose chip in there.\n\n275\n00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,470\nAnd I need to go tighten that up.\n\n276\n00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,280\nIn my case,\nI do actually have eight gigs of memory.\n\n277\n00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,330\nSo that shows up just fine.\n\n278\n00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,910\nBut I can go back to hardware test and\nclick this button.\n\n279\n00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,160\nAnd now it's gonna run the basic test.\n\n280\n00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,830\nOn my MacBook Pro if I had booted,\n\n281\n00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,070\nI would've gotten a black screen that\nimmediately started running the test.\n\n282\n00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,070\nAnd I wouldn't have had those choices\nthat I got right here on the desktop.\n\n283\n00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,570\nSo the desktop one is\na little more powerful.\n\n284\n00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,250\nSo you let it run, and\nit's going to examine your hardware and\n\n285\n00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,030\nit's going to look to see if it\ncan find anything that's wrong.\n\n286\n00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,240\nAnd if it's wrong,\nit'll let you know what it is.\n\n287\n00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,160\nAnd now you can take down\nto the Apple store or\n\n288\n00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,970\nwherever to actually get it repaired.\n\n289\n00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,160\nSo neat little diagnostic there.\n\n290\n00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,400\nAnd this is all done\nInside of the bootrom.\n\n291\n00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,180\nSo this would work even if I\ndidn't have a hard drive attached.\n\n292\n00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,230\nYou don't need Mac OS to function in\norder to run these hardware tests.\n\n293\n00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,530\nIt's a great way to do\na hardware diagnostic and\n\n294\n00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,800\nthis is normally the first place I go.\n\n295\n00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,960\nWhen I think I have a firmware problem,\n\n296\n00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,470\nwhen I never do get that\ngray apple up on the screen.\n\n297\n00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,280\nIf I get the gray apple up on the screen,\nthat means my power on self test passed.\n\n298\n00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,670\nThat means it's already coming up and\nstarting to look to the hard drive.\n\n299\n00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,510\nBy that point,\n\n300\n00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,040\nthe only hardware failure you might have\nwould actually be a hard drive failure.\n\n301\n00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,670\nIf you have a hard drive failure,\n\n302\n00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,870\na lot of times you'll still get\nthat gray apple on the screen, And\n\n303\n00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,320\nthen it just doesn't get to where you\nget the loading bar at the bottom right?\n\n304\n00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,400\nSo you get some different input there.\n\n305\n00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,780\nThis is why it's important to\nunderstand the different stages of boot\n\n306\n00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,440\nbecause you have different\nproblems at each stage.\n\n307\n00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,020\nAt this stage it's almost always hardware.\n\n308\n00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,140\nRight, now Notice the first test\nit's run here, testing memory.\n\n309\n00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,170\nMemory problems are more\ncommon than you'd think.\n\n310\n00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,410\nA lot of people have memory problems and\n\n311\n00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:27,060\ndon't realize it, because memory problems\noftentimes look like hard drive problems.\n\n312\n00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,840\nYou save a file to your hard drive,\nand then you go to open it and\n\n313\n00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,040\nthe file's corrupt, and you go, oh,\ngreat, my hard drive must be failing,\n\n314\n00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,480\nmy file got corrupted.\n\n315\n00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,368\nWell, what happens is,\nany time you save a file,\n\n316\n00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:41,240\nthe file was stored in RAM and then it\nwrites it from RAM down to the hard drive.\n\n317\n00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,770\nAnd when you open a file,\nit opens the file from the hard drive and\n\n318\n00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,600\ncopies it into RAM and\nthen you read it from RAM.\n\n319\n00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,780\nSo if your RAM is bad,\nanything that you copy to or\n\n320\n00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,120\nfrom the hard drive is\npassing through your RAM.\n\n321\n00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,478\nAnd it can look like the file\nis corrupted or damaged and\n\n322\n00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:57,333\nit's not the hard drive that's at fault.\n\n323\n00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,000\nIt's your RAM that's at fault.\n\n324\n00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,417\nSo, memory failures\nare commonly undiagnosed.\n\n325\n00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:05,083\nAnd people change their hard drives\nout and still have problems.\n\n326\n00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,898\nMemory failures can cause random lockups,\nright, you're working along,\n\n327\n00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:10,292\nyour Mac's doing fine, and\nthen all of a sudden it just freezes.\n\n328\n00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:13,729\nThe whole thing just freezes,\nnothing responds, can't use the mouse,\n\n329\n00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:14,792\njust frozen, right.\n\n330\n00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:17,042\nRam, bad RAM, could do that, right.\n\n331\n00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:21,370\nYour system fails to boot, or you start\ngetting audible beep codes when you boot.\n\n332\n00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,700\nMissing memory or\nbad memory can do that, right.\n\n333\n00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,360\nSo it is a very guilty,\ncold written memory runs fairly hot,\n\n334\n00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,470\na lot of electricity is moving through on\na constant basis, and they do fail, so\n\n335\n00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,100\nit is something that can happen.\n\n336\n00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,030\nThe hardware test will help you spot that.\n\n337\n00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,230\nSo, it was testing memory there, now it's\ngoing through and testing other systems,\n\n338\n00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,160\nchecking the processor,\nthe busses that are on the system,\n\n339\n00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,730\nchecking the video card.\n\n340\n00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,240\nAnd it'll continue on to run.\n\n341\n00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,940\nI don't wanna bore us by sitting\nhere having to watch this little bar\n\n342\n00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,180\ncreep across the screen for half an hour.\n\n343\n00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,180\nBut it shouldn't take too\nterribly much longer.\n\n344\n00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,280\nMaybe what we'll do is we'll stop here and\ntake a break, and\n\n345\n00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,700\nlet that kinda finish up.\n\n346\n00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,470\nAnd when it's done, we can look at the\nresults of that test and see whether or\n\n347\n00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,070\nnot we had any hardware problems.\n\n348\n00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,860\nSo let's do that, let's pause here.\n\n349\n00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,980\nAnd when we get back, we'll continue\ntaking a look at that diagnostic.\n\n350\n00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,429\nStay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n351\n00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:15,828\n[MUSIC]\n\n352\n00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:17,820\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n353\n00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,260\nDuring the break we had a great\nquestion in the chat room from Carl,\n\n354\n00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,580\nhe asked about whether that hardware\ndiagnostic can run from the internet.\n\n355\n00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,240\nWe're gonna see where a lot of our newer\nMacs can do things like boot recovery\n\n356\n00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,430\nfrom the internet, and access the system\neven if there's no hard drive attached.\n\n357\n00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,630\nThe hardware diagnostics,\naren't able to do that.\n\n358\n00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,080\nWhen the hardware diagnostics run,\nthey're running from the boot ROM and\n\n359\n00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,530\nthey're testing things\nlike the network card.\n\n360\n00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,290\nSo the network card's not actually\nfunctioning at this stage.\n\n361\n00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,980\nThe wireless adapters aren't\nfunctioning at this stage.\n\n362\n00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,750\nAnd so the hardware diagnostic\ndoes run just right\n\n363\n00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,210\nfrom the motherboard of the system.\n\n364\n00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,830\nNot from the internet.\n\n365\n00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,220\nSo that's where that one's tied.\n\n366\n00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,990\nIt's actually not even running from\na partition on the hard drive.\n\n367\n00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,060\nThe Apple Hardware Diagnostics\nare embedded on the system board itself,\n\n368\n00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,500\nso you could take your hard drive out and\nunplug all your network adapters, and\n\n369\n00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,320\nthe diagnostics would\nstill run from that unit.\n\n370\n00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,570\nThat's the way that it's designed.\n\n371\n00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,250\nAll right, so mine finished.\n\n372\n00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:23,250\nAnd when the test finishes, you'll see\nis this screen's not terribly exciting.\n\n373\n00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,510\nSee how it says passed number one.\n\n374\n00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,800\nIt only ran one set of tests,\nand no trouble found.\n\n375\n00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,110\nSo it looks like my system Is okay.\n\n376\n00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,550\nIf it found an error,\nit would display the error right there and\n\n377\n00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,120\nlet me know the issue was.\n\n378\n00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,520\nIf I had ran the extended test, it would\nhave done more than one pass, and I would\n\n379\n00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,250\nhave seen like pass number three or\nhowever many passes that it was set for.\n\n380\n00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,110\nSo you've got that capability and\nyou can see it.\n\n381\n00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,530\nIf you check that off then it's\ngoing to run the extended test, and\n\n382\n00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,520\nsee how it goes one hour or longer.\n\n383\n00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,090\nSo that is where pull it up and\n\n384\n00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,350\nwe get the information that\nwe can report back to Apple.\n\n385\n00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,540\nA lot of times if you take your device\ndown to one of the Apple stores for\n\n386\n00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,740\nrepair, this is exactly what they are\ndoing just booting right into the hardware\n\n387\n00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,760\ntest and running this check,\nand if this comes out okay,\n\n388\n00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,120\nthen whatever your problem is may\nactually be a software problem.\n\n389\n00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,090\nAnd there's a number of things\nthat can cause that, right?\n\n390\n00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,590\nYou can have a corrupted\noperating system or whatever.\n\n391\n00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,720\nAnd that's when we start\nto boot from recovery.\n\n392\n00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,690\nAnd when we do that, that's when we got\nthe option to boot from internet based\n\n393\n00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,730\nrecovery or regular recovery and you can\nstart to use all the advanced tools.\n\n394\n00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,670\nBut this one?\n\n395\n00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,370\nReal basic.\n\n396\n00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,350\nReal low level stuff here.\n\n397\n00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:29,730\nAll right, assuming everything's\ngood you can hit restart and\n\n398\n00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,680\nyour system will boot up.\n\n399\n00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,310\nNow I activated the hardware diagnostics\nhere by holding down the letter\n\n400\n00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,610\nD while booting.\n\n401\n00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,270\nD for diagnostic right,\nthat's how we can remember that.\n\n402\n00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,180\nHold down the letter D while you boot up,\nall right.\n\n403\n00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,220\nNow when you push your power button.\n\n404\n00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,100\nOne of the other things you'll hear\nis that if you get a successful post,\n\n405\n00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,650\nif everything goes fine and\nit starts to hand off,\n\n406\n00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:55,570\nyou'll hear the iconic Mac sound.\n\n407\n00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,880\nWhen you power on a Mac, it's been like\nthis for 20 years, you'll hear that gong.\n\n408\n00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,815\nThey call it the Mac chime, the Apple\nchime, where it goes [SOUND] I know,\n\n409\n00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:06,827\nthat's a terrible impersonation.\n\n410\n00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:10,099\n[LAUGH] If you want a better\nimpersonation, watch WALL-E,\n\n411\n00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:11,810\nthat's how he boots up.\n\n412\n00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,080\nBut you'll hear that noise\nwhen the Mac boots up, and\n\n413\n00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,880\nit lets you know that it's\na successful boot, and\n\n414\n00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,850\ntypically that means that all\nof your hardware has passed.\n\n415\n00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,260\nAfter that, we get our gray\nscreen with the gray apple on it.\n\n416\n00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,400\nAnd that's where we're\ngoing into our booter.\n\n417\n00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,820\nNow what the booter is doing is a booter\nis looking at your hard drives and\n\n418\n00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,270\ntrying to find an operating\nsystem to boot.\n\n419\n00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,570\nNow I shouldn't just say hard drive.\n\n420\n00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,660\nIt's also looking for\nUSB keys and your super drive and\n\n421\n00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,532\nall the various places you might\nchoose to boot your system from.\n\n422\n00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:41,420\nAll right.\n\n423\n00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,640\nThe booters what's response for that.\n\n424\n00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,820\nNow the booter is a part of the hardware\nits a part of the motherboard right.\n\n425\n00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,505\nIts part of that boot ROM that's\npart of that whole start.\n\n426\n00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:54,480\nIt's all linked together\nthis whole whole process, so\n\n427\n00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,290\nwhen you power it on the power on self\ntest happen the boot ROM does its job and\n\n428\n00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,860\nwhen everything passes,\nthen it turns over control to the booter.\n\n429\n00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,300\nThat's when we see the gray\nscreen with the gray apple.\n\n430\n00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,490\nNow the booter in modern Macs, any Mac\nmade in the last, probably three or\n\n431\n00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,530\nfour years, uses EFI.\n\n432\n00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,700\nEFI is a type of BIOS that has\nbeen adopted not just by Macs,\n\n433\n00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,870\nbut by Windows machines,\nLinux machines, it's pretty generic.\n\n434\n00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:24,610\nAnd it's the extensible\nfirmware Interface.\n\n435\n00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,750\nIt's a standard way that hardware can\nboot up and find an operating system.\n\n436\n00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,840\nAnd the operating system might be on\na hard drive, which might be magnetic or\n\n437\n00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,940\nsolid state.\n\n438\n00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,720\nIt might find it on an optical drive,\nlike CD, DVD, or Blu-ray.\n\n439\n00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,910\nIt might find it on a USB drive,\nlike a USB hard drive or USB thumb drive.\n\n440\n00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,040\nIt might even find it on flash memory,\n\n441\n00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,132\nlike an SD card that's\nadded on to a system.\n\n442\n00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:49,140\nThe can handle all of those.\n\n443\n00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,140\nIt's just a standard instruction set\nthat says if you see any storage media,\n\n444\n00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,560\nlook for this kind of data.\n\n445\n00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,380\nThis kind of data is going to tell\nus we've got an operating system\n\n446\n00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,570\nwe can boot from.\n\n447\n00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,650\nSo when I restart this machine,\n\n448\n00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,330\nI'm going to hit restart and\nthe booter's going to happen.\n\n449\n00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,830\nNow, we don't normally see the booter,\n\n450\n00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:10,130\nbecause the booter just happens\nvery quickly and automatic.\n\n451\n00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:15,470\nIt uses a setting that we have in\nthe Mac called the startup disk.\n\n452\n00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,770\nWhen you go into your system\npreferences in a Mac,\n\n453\n00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,490\none of the system preferences\nis called startup disk.\n\n454\n00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,840\nAnd you pick which disk\nyou're gonna boot from.\n\n455\n00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,310\nSo when you boot up a Mac, it\nautomatically goes to that startup disk,\n\n456\n00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,240\nand the booter then transitions to the\nkernel, and that's what I'm seeing here.\n\n457\n00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,770\nThis gray Apple with\na booting bar at the bottom,\n\n458\n00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,580\na status bar,\nthe booter has already done its job.\n\n459\n00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,030\nIt found the hard drive,\nit found the kernel I wanna boot from.\n\n460\n00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,620\nRemember, the kernel,\nthat's the heart of your operating system,\n\n461\n00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,440\nthe single component\nthat controls everything.\n\n462\n00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,390\nAnd it's turned over\ncontrol to the kernel.\n\n463\n00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,720\nAnd the kernel was doing its work.\n\n464\n00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,236\nSo by the time you see that loading bar,\nthe booter is already gone.\n\n465\n00:22:54,236 --> 00:22:57,680\nBut if you wanna see the booter,\nyou can, right?\n\n466\n00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,730\nIf we go and reboot this system,\n\n467\n00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:07,050\nif you hold down the Option key on\nyour keyboard while you reboot, right.\n\n468\n00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:12,150\nSo I'm just going to hold down that Option\nkey, it's the Alternate slash Option key.\n\n469\n00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,350\nIf you hold it down,\nyou'll get to see the booter, right?\n\n470\n00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,950\nThis booter that's\nnormally hidden from us.\n\n471\n00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:23,100\nSo I'm restarting here and I am\npatiently holding down the option key.\n\n472\n00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,690\nI'm doing it patiently now, but\nit's only gonna last so long.\n\n473\n00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,690\nThere we go.\n\n474\n00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,910\nAnd now we see the booter, all right?\n\n475\n00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,850\nNow the booter is gonna boot\nto a hard drive by default.\n\n476\n00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,330\nIn my case,\nit's this one flagged as Macintosh HD.\n\n477\n00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,070\nAll right?\n\n478\n00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,300\nSo that's the one that I've got\nflagged as my start up disk,\n\n479\n00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,130\nthe one I want to boot from.\n\n480\n00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,650\nBut I can override that if I want.\n\n481\n00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,720\nI can boot from recovery,\nso it's showing that one.\n\n482\n00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,030\nI can boot from the network,\nif I had a net boot server set up.\n\n483\n00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,800\nAnd I can pick a wireless network\nhere that I wanna boot from and\n\n484\n00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,640\nI can boot to that right.\n\n485\n00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,610\nSome of these have their own shortcuts,\nfor example if I wanted to boot to\n\n486\n00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,947\nrecovery, and\nif you're trying to write all this down,\n\n487\n00:23:59,947 --> 00:24:02,189\ndon't worry I'll post all\nthese with the show notes,\n\n488\n00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:04,500\nall the different shortcuts\nyou can do when you boot up.\n\n489\n00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,958\nIf I want to boot to recovery,\nI could've just held Cmd+R when I booted.\n\n490\n00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,661\nAnd that's what I did way back in some\nof the first episodes we've filmed\n\n491\n00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:12,250\nfor this show.\n\n492\n00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,078\nI held Cmd+R on the keyboard and\nbooted up, and\n\n493\n00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,990\nthat told it to boot from recovery.\n\n494\n00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,292\nOr if you wanna boot from network,\nyou can just hold down N.\n\n495\n00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:24,792\nIf you hold down the N key on your\nkeyboard that says boot from the network.\n\n496\n00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:27,790\nSo I don't need to go into\nthe booter to choose these.\n\n497\n00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,560\nIt can be hidden from me, and\njust use those other options.\n\n498\n00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,580\nAnd again,\nI still don't have to see the booter.\n\n499\n00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,630\nSo most of us never deal with it.\n\n500\n00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,570\nBut if you've got a boot camp, for\n\n501\n00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,950\nexample, you might have a Mac\npartition and a Windows partition.\n\n502\n00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,260\nAnd so when you boot up you hold Alt on\nyour keyboard so you can pick, all right,\n\n503\n00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,930\nI wanna boot from the Windows\npartition this time.\n\n504\n00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,390\nI wanna boot from the Mac\npartition this time.\n\n505\n00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,170\nAnd the booter lets you do that.\n\n506\n00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,830\nYou just hold down Alt while you boot.\n\n507\n00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,770\nJust to tie back to Carlton's\nquestion from during the break,\n\n508\n00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,420\nwhen I say boot from recovery and\nboot from network,\n\n509\n00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:04,130\nlike hold down N to boot from network,\nrecovery can boot from internet.\n\n510\n00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,610\nAnd that means, instead of loading\nthe recovery that's right here on my\n\n511\n00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,600\nhard drive, I can load the recovery\nfrom Apple's server that are out there.\n\n512\n00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,750\nIf I have a blank hard drive,\na brand new hard drive in my system,\n\n513\n00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,890\nit's not gonna have a recovery partition.\n\n514\n00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:23,435\nSo instead of Cmd+R when you boot,\nyou can do Cmd+Option+R.\n\n515\n00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:25,750\nCommand+Option+R, holding\ndown that Option key,\n\n516\n00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,690\nthat says boot from the internet instead,\nand so Command+Option+R will cause that.\n\n517\n00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,330\nNow that looks a lot different than what\nwe see here, in fact let me, here we are,\n\n518\n00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,050\nwe'll just choose this one,\nI'll show you guys what I mean.\n\n519\n00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,710\nSo, if I choose recovery and\nI boot from this one,\n\n520\n00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,580\nit's gonna load the recovery partition\nfrom right here on my system.\n\n521\n00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,160\nIf I have a blank hard drive,\nit'll know it's not there and\n\n522\n00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,510\nit'll automatically\nboot from the internet.\n\n523\n00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,920\nBut if I suspect the recovery\npartition is damaged on my system,\n\n524\n00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,220\nI might wanna make it\nboot from the internet.\n\n525\n00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,700\nOr maybe my hard drive is good, but\n\n526\n00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,280\nwhoever set this up deleted\nthe recovery partition.\n\n527\n00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,270\nYou can, you can wipe the recovery\npartition, some people do it.\n\n528\n00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,850\nIf that's the case, then I might want\nto force it to boot from the internet.\n\n529\n00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:14,619\nAnd so instead of booting with Cmd+R\nbeing held, I would hold Cmd+Option+R.\n\n530\n00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:18,951\nAnd when that boots,\ninstead of seeing an apple on the screen,\n\n531\n00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:21,550\nyou'll see a globe, the Earth.\n\n532\n00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:24,270\nAnd that's how you know it's\nbooting from the internet.\n\n533\n00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:24,990\nThat actually reminds me,\n\n534\n00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,740\nthere's one other thing that\nyou might see when you boot up.\n\n535\n00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,640\nAn apple, that's usually a good sign.\n\n536\n00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,540\nThat means that it found your partition\nthat it's gonna boot from, and\n\n537\n00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,740\nit's ready to go.\n\n538\n00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,550\nIf you see a globe,\nthat means it's booting from the internet.\n\n539\n00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,793\nIf you see a folder with\na question mark on it,\n\n540\n00:26:39,793 --> 00:26:45,290\na folder with a question mark means\nthe booter fired up, it looked\n\n541\n00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,630\nat all of your drives, and it couldn't\nfind one that was valid to boot on.\n\n542\n00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,030\nIt couldn't find an operating\nsystem anywhere.\n\n543\n00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,460\nThere was no recovery partition,\nthere was no OS partition, no Windows,\n\n544\n00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,820\nno Mac, no anything.\n\n545\n00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:03,920\nIf you've got hard drives and the boot\nsector has somehow become damaged on then.\n\n546\n00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,100\nWhen you boot up,\nEFI might not be able to find that system.\n\n547\n00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,430\nAnd if it can't find it,\n\n548\n00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:14,380\nthen we end up with a folder with\na question mark on it as the icon.\n\n549\n00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,472\nAll right,\nnow my system is booting into recovery.\n\n550\n00:27:16,472 --> 00:27:18,870\nIt's gonna go into a black screen for\na second here, and\n\n551\n00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,400\nI should get my recovery\nscreen any moment.\n\n552\n00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,210\nI'm glancing over here\nat my other monitor coz\n\n553\n00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,700\nI kind of expected it to be here already.\n\n554\n00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,627\nI might actually have recovery problem.\n\n555\n00:27:27,627 --> 00:27:28,596\nHere's a great example.\n\n556\n00:27:28,596 --> 00:27:32,170\nMaybe my recovery partition\non this Mac is damaged.\n\n557\n00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,380\nI don't think I've ever booted\nthis one into recovery before.\n\n558\n00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,390\nSo it could be.\n\n559\n00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,020\nThis might be a great chance for\nme to say,\n\n560\n00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,980\nwell, let me just boot it\nfrom the internet instead.\n\n561\n00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,090\nSo I'm gonna leverage Nate's help again.\n\n562\n00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,330\nNate, can I get you to do me a favor.\n\n563\n00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,350\nOn that Mac, can you hold down the power\nbutton until the light goes off?\n\n564\n00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,535\nAs another little advice there, if your\nMac is ever frozen and it won't turn off,\n\n565\n00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:56,300\nif you hold the power button after\nabout ten seconds, it will power off.\n\n566\n00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,330\nThat's what it does,\nit kind of overrides the power supply.\n\n567\n00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,270\nSo it's off?\n\n568\n00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,090\nAll right.\n\n569\n00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:05,490\nAnd I'm gonna hold Cmd+Option+R, and Nate\ncan you press the power button for me?\n\n570\n00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,360\nSo I'm just holding Cmd+Option+R\non my keyboard, and\n\n571\n00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,860\nhe hit that power button,\nit's gonna start booting up.\n\n572\n00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,133\nNow Cmd+R would normally tell\nit to boot from recovery.\n\n573\n00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:19,440\nCmd+Option+R is gonna tell it\nto boot internet recovery and\n\n574\n00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,000\nit's gonna reach out to Apple server,\nthere we go.\n\n575\n00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,660\nSee how I have a globe this time\n\n576\n00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,460\nletting me know that I'm\nbooting from the internet.\n\n577\n00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,030\nSo if you don't trust the recovery\npartition on your hard drive or\n\n578\n00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,820\nyou don't have one, here's a great option.\n\n579\n00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,950\nIf you have a blank hard drive, then\nthe Mac will try to do this on its own,\n\n580\n00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,580\nright, it'll try and reach out.\n\n581\n00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,930\nNow this internet recovery is\nnot supported by every Mac.\n\n582\n00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,190\nIf you got a Mac made in the last\ntwo years, it'll support it, but\n\n583\n00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,480\nif it's three or four years old,\nit may not do it.\n\n584\n00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,480\nAnd you really base it on what\noperating system it shipped with.\n\n585\n00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,840\nIf it's shipped with Mavericks or\nYosemite, it'll support internet recovery.\n\n586\n00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,100\nBut if it's shipped with Mountain Lion or\nSnow Leopard or\n\n587\n00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,050\nsomething like that it may not support it.\n\n588\n00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:06,055\nIf you've done all your updates it should,\nbut if you haven't it may not.\n\n589\n00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:10,800\nSo,don't count on internet\nrecovery always being there.\n\n590\n00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,610\nIf it isn't,\nwhat you need to do is take a USBP and\n\n591\n00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:20,320\nmake a Yosemite installation media like\nwe showed back in the earlier episodes.\n\n592\n00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,560\nAnd you can boot off of that key and\nuse that for recovery.\n\n593\n00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,700\nThe installation media will have\na recovery partition on it,\n\n594\n00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,030\nand that will work.\n\n595\n00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:27,620\nAll right.\nSo\n\n596\n00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,770\nthere's some different\nways to get around that.\n\n597\n00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,230\nNow when you boot from Internet Recovery,\nit does take longer.\n\n598\n00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,220\nIt's having to reach out\nto Apple servers and\n\n599\n00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,750\nbasically download the operating system.\n\n600\n00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,540\nIt downloads about 600 megabytes of data.\n\n601\n00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,390\nIf you're on a fast internet connection,\nit doesn't take very long.\n\n602\n00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,150\nIf you're on a slow\nconnection like well dial up,\n\n603\n00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,550\nyou don't even wanna mess with it,\n\n604\n00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:50,990\nbut if it was a slow like DLS link, then\nit could take a few minutes to boot up.\n\n605\n00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,800\nSo you walk away, you get some coffee,\nthen come back and\n\n606\n00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,440\nyou'll be booted into recovery.\n\n607\n00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,970\nSo the recovery partition on my hard\ndrive didn't quite work so well for\n\n608\n00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,380\nme, this one might, and\nnow I can get into recovery.\n\n609\n00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:07,170\nNow as far as the booter is concerned,\nthere's not much we really deal with here.\n\n610\n00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,180\nIf our operating system is damaged,\nthen what we would do is we'd boot into\n\n611\n00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,820\nrecovery, and\nwe'd use disk utility to check our disks.\n\n612\n00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,160\nIf it was really damaged beyond repair,\nthen we could reinstall mac OS,\n\n613\n00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,940\nbut recovery won't let us do that.\n\n614\n00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,740\nSo, any problems at the booter stage,\n\n615\n00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,717\nrecovery is really the tool\nthat we're gonna use.\n\n616\n00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,400\nOkay, instead of waiting\non that one to boot,\n\n617\n00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,830\nlet me show you on my\nlaptop what you can do.\n\n618\n00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,020\nOnce the system boots into recovery,\n\n619\n00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,480\nthere's really just two\nthings you're looking for.\n\n620\n00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,680\nYou're looking to adjust\nthe startup disk or\n\n621\n00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,460\nyou're looking to use the disk\nutility to repair your disk.\n\n622\n00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,390\nNow I know we've shown both\nin earlier episodes, but\n\n623\n00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,210\nlet me just kind of recap them.\n\n624\n00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,670\nIn recovery, right under your Apple Menu,\n\n625\n00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:48,710\nyou'll have that Startup Disk option\nif you're actually booted like I am.\n\n626\n00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,690\nYou can go into System Preferences and\nyou'll see start up disc right there, and\n\n627\n00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,360\nthat lets you pick which disc\nyou're going to boot from.\n\n628\n00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,630\nSo I can see my disc right there,\nI can pick and boot from that.\n\n629\n00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,170\nYou might see other discs.\n\n630\n00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,580\nNotice that the recovery\npartition does not show up.\n\n631\n00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,270\nYou can't set the recovery\npartition as your start up disk.\n\n632\n00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,580\nIt won't let you.\n\n633\n00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,960\nWell there is actually a way to do it, but\nin the GUI here it won't let you do it.\n\n634\n00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,710\nAnd that's because you've got a keyboard\nshortcut that will do that for you.\n\n635\n00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,310\nSo, that's one way, is to choose right\nthere the proper start up disk and\n\n636\n00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,880\nthen the other thing is to\nlaunch the disk utility.\n\n637\n00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,220\nAnd when you're in recovery,\n\n638\n00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,020\nthat's right up under your utility\nmenu and you'll see disk utility.\n\n639\n00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,346\nAnd you can choose your disk,\n\n640\n00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:32,280\nand in your disk you can choose to\nverify the disk and repair the disk.\n\n641\n00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,260\nIf there's something wrong\nwith it's boot sector.\n\n642\n00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,870\nIf there's something wrong with\nit's EFI files, it'll find that and\n\n643\n00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,400\nit'll correct it.\n\n644\n00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,290\nAnd actually speaking of those EFI files,\n\n645\n00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,980\nlet me show you kind of\nwhat's going on there.\n\n646\n00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,130\nWhen your system boots, the booter\nactually does come from your hard drive.\n\n647\n00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:54,060\nIf I fire up my terminal,\nI can browse to where that is.\n\n648\n00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,875\nIt's in a folder where you\nwouldn't normally go to.\n\n649\n00:31:55,875 --> 00:32:00,935\nIt's inside of system/library/core\n\n650\n00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:06,000\nservices, and if I poke around in here.\n\n651\n00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,458\nWhoops.\n\n652\n00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,740\nThere we go.\n\n653\n00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,333\nThere's this boot.efi.\n\n654\n00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,375\nThat's your booter.\n\n655\n00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:13,430\nThat's what it's reading.\n\n656\n00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,750\nThat's where that's coming from.\n\n657\n00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,898\nAnd so if you boot your system up and\nthe booter is damaged,\n\n658\n00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:19,580\nwhere's it gonna get it from?\n\n659\n00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,560\nWell, there's a copy of\nthe booter in recovery too.\n\n660\n00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,540\nSo, I actually have more\nthan one copy of the booter.\n\n661\n00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,430\nBut if my hard drive is completely blank,\nthe booter doesn't exist, does it?\n\n662\n00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,350\nSo it's gonna come up with that\nfolder with the question mark.\n\n663\n00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,550\nIt couldn't find the booter to then go and\nfind a bootable operating system.\n\n664\n00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,593\nSo those are some of the different things\nwe'll see at boot time when it's going to\n\n665\n00:32:39,593 --> 00:32:41,595\nload and fire the system up, all right?\n\n666\n00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:45,752\nOnce it finds the operating\nsystem of choice, though,\n\n667\n00:32:45,752 --> 00:32:49,847\nat that point we start to see the loading\nbar appear at the bottom of the screen.\n\n668\n00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:54,570\nThat means it found the operating system\nthat we wanted, and it's starting to boot.\n\n669\n00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,213\nThe booter hands off\ncontrol over to the kernel.\n\n670\n00:32:58,213 --> 00:33:01,520\nAnd the kernel,\nthat's our operating system, right?\n\n671\n00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:07,600\nThat's the actual BSD core that runs\nunderneath Mac OS that starts up.\n\n672\n00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,392\nAnd it's the kernel's job to\nstart up everything else.\n\n673\n00:33:11,392 --> 00:33:11,993\nAll right,\n\n674\n00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:15,975\nto start loading all the kernel extensions\nthat power our advanced hardware.\n\n675\n00:33:15,975 --> 00:33:20,327\nTo get all of the fancy things that we\nneed running up and going on our system,\n\n676\n00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:21,415\nand get it ready and\n\n677\n00:33:21,415 --> 00:33:25,340\nput into a state where the computer\ncan be usable by us, right?\n\n678\n00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,150\nAnd the kernel, we don't normally see.\n\n679\n00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,540\nHere it is.\n\n680\n00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,957\nIf you go to a terminal and\nyou just do uname -a,\n\n681\n00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:34,564\nthat'll show you information\nabout your kernel.\n\n682\n00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:38,590\nAnd I can see that I'm\nrunning the Darwin kernel.\n\n683\n00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,609\nNow BSD,\nis the Berkeley System Distribution,\n\n684\n00:33:41,609 --> 00:33:44,100\nI believe is what that stands for.\n\n685\n00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,990\nAnd it's just a variation of Unix that was\ncreated by the University of California\n\n686\n00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,510\nat Berkeley.\n\n687\n00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,670\nApple has taken that and\nmodified it, all right?\n\n688\n00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,970\nBut it's open source, they release\nthe source code out to the public, but\n\n689\n00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,180\nthat modified kernel they made,\nthey call Darwin, all right?\n\n690\n00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,720\nSo it's the Darwin kernel,\nand part of evolution, right,\n\n691\n00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,870\nevolving Mac into the next stage,\nthat's why they called it Darwin.\n\n692\n00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:09,420\nAnd so\nI've got the Darwin kernel version 14.1.\n\n693\n00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:14,510\nSo when the booter on my system picked my\nhard drive, it then turned over control\n\n694\n00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:19,770\nto the Darwin kernel and it fired up and\nit started to get my system running.\n\n695\n00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:20,280\nAll right.\n\n696\n00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,250\nSo that's at the very beginning\nof the operating system loading.\n\n697\n00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,600\nNow, the kernel can have issues.\n\n698\n00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,100\nThere can be problems.\n\n699\n00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,830\nThe problems that you have are typically\nrelated to corrupted hard drive or\n\n700\n00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,430\nfailing hard drives.\n\n701\n00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:36,540\nOr they're related to bad extensions.\n\n702\n00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,860\nAs we load drivers onto our system,\n\n703\n00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,628\nthey are all getting thrown\ninto /Library/Extensions/.\n\n704\n00:34:45,628 --> 00:34:48,059\nAll right, so you can see where\nI've loaded some drivers,\n\n705\n00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:49,820\nsome network card drivers here.\n\n706\n00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:55,480\nI've got some extra Logitech drivers for\nmy keyboard and mouse.\n\n707\n00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,550\nI've got some HP printer library or\nextensions loaded.\n\n708\n00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,770\nSo these are all extensions that\nfire up when I turn my computer on.\n\n709\n00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,770\nWell, if one of those extensions is bad,\nthe kernel could go to load it,\n\n710\n00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,440\nand the system crashes.\n\n711\n00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,740\nThe system dies out, okay.\n\n712\n00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,490\nSo how do I know that that's happening?\n\n713\n00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,320\nHow do I know which one\nof those is the problem?\n\n714\n00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,060\nWell, there's two tactics\nthat you can take.\n\n715\n00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,950\nThere's one tactic,\nwhich is to do what's called a safe boot.\n\n716\n00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,690\nA safe boot is where\nyou turn the Mac on and\n\n717\n00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,790\nyou tell it not to load any extensions.\n\n718\n00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:32,400\nTo boot up without loading these extra\nextensions and let you get in, all right.\n\n719\n00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,660\nIt's a quick easy way to test and\n\n720\n00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,380\nsee whether you actually do\nhave an extension problem.\n\n721\n00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,250\nTo do a safe boot, you just hold\ndown the Shift key while you boot.\n\n722\n00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,770\nIf you boot your Mac while holding\ndown Shift, it will come up and\n\n723\n00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,120\nnot load any extensions.\n\n724\n00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,580\nNow, if that works, great.\n\n725\n00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,640\nYou know you have an extension problem.\n\n726\n00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,890\nWhich one?\n\n727\n00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,830\nWell it's kind of hard to figure out which\none was the problem because you just\n\n728\n00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,330\nunloaded all of them.\n\n729\n00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,580\nYou could uninstall them and\nreinstall them one by one but\n\n730\n00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,380\nthat takes a lot of time.\n\n731\n00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,520\nInstead, what you can do is you can boot\nyour Mac in what's called verbose mode.\n\n732\n00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,061\nWhen you see that Apple and the loading\nbar is at the bottom there's actually\n\n733\n00:36:10,061 --> 00:36:13,449\nstuff that's going on in the background\nthat's being hidden from you.\n\n734\n00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:15,120\nYou just see the status bar.\n\n735\n00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,750\nIf you put it in verbose mode, you'll\nsee a bunch of text on the screen and\n\n736\n00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,970\nit actually shows you what's going wrong,\nor going right I guess.\n\n737\n00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,540\nYou see what's going right and then\nwhen something goes wrong it stops and\n\n738\n00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,030\nwherever it stops, that's your problem.\n\n739\n00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,670\nAnd it'll normally be\none of those extensions,\n\n740\n00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,900\nnow you know which one to get out.\n\n741\n00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,801\nSo I want to show you guys that process,\nI want to show you safe boot, and\n\n742\n00:36:36,801 --> 00:36:39,616\nthen I want to show you\nbooting up into verbose mode.\n\n743\n00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:42,641\nBut I'm a little short on time in\nthis segment, so let's stop here and\n\n744\n00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:43,680\ntake a break.\n\n745\n00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,620\nAnd when we get back,\nwe'll take a look at that process.\n\n746\n00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,288\nSo stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n747\n00:36:48,288 --> 00:36:51,609\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n748\n00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:56,927\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n749\n00:36:56,927 --> 00:37:00,959\nSo let's say that we're booting up our\nsystem, and we get the Apple logo,\n\n750\n00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:04,750\nand the little progress bar is creeping\nacross and then it just stops.\n\n751\n00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,298\nIt doesn't make it all the way through,\nI don't get to boot,\n\n752\n00:37:07,298 --> 00:37:08,970\nright, or it just reboots.\n\n753\n00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,080\nWell, I could hold down Shift while I\nboot, and that's gonna do a safe boot.\n\n754\n00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,797\nThat'll disable all my extensions,\nwe can see if we boot, right.\n\n755\n00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,730\nOr I could boot in what's\ncalled verbose mode, and\n\n756\n00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,420\nthat's what I want to show you guys now.\n\n757\n00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,794\nI'm gonna hold down\nCmd+V on my keyboard and\n\n758\n00:37:23,794 --> 00:37:26,650\nget Nate to press that\npower button over there.\n\n759\n00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:31,420\nSo I'm holding Cmd+V on the keyboard to\nget it to go into verbose mode, all right.\n\n760\n00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,500\nWhen it boots,\nI get my gray screen with my Apple, and\n\n761\n00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,750\nthen when the loading bar would normally\ncome up, instead I see all this, right.\n\n762\n00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,200\nWhat is all this stuff?\n\n763\n00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,090\nWell, this is the Darwin\nkernel booting up and\n\n764\n00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,580\nstarting to load all the various\nother stuff in the operating system.\n\n765\n00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,310\nIt's loading all the extensions and\nstart up agents.\n\n766\n00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,580\nAnd all that other great stuff that\nhappens when you power on a Mac.\n\n767\n00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,210\nThis is normally hidden from us because\nend users don't need to see it.\n\n768\n00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,260\nAlso there's some errors in here\nthat are just normally expected\n\n769\n00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,290\nthat end users might think\nmeans something is wrong.\n\n770\n00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:06,710\nLike I can see, unable to get VHT\ncapabilities and that just means I\n\n771\n00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:09,650\ndon't necessarily have that particular\nhardware on that wireless card.\n\n772\n00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,250\nIt's not necessarily a problem.\n\n773\n00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:15,550\nSo I get to see a lot more of what\nhappens during the boot process.\n\n774\n00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,790\nIf I'm getting a freeze, or\na reboot during that boot process,\n\n775\n00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:25,020\nin verbose mode I can see what it was,\nI can see what the problem was.\n\n776\n00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:30,320\nNow, booting with Cmd+V, booting in\nVerbose Mode boots you like normal.\n\n777\n00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,310\nSo it boots up and it actually does\nload all of my extensions, right?\n\n778\n00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,008\nAnd that's important because we\nneed it to load those extensions,\n\n779\n00:38:37,008 --> 00:38:39,721\nif we're gonna figure out which one\nis the one causing the problem.\n\n780\n00:38:39,721 --> 00:38:40,507\nAll right?\n\n781\n00:38:40,507 --> 00:38:45,108\nBut if I just fire this up and\ngo into my system information,\n\n782\n00:38:45,108 --> 00:38:49,536\nwhich I've got this thing\ndoing too many things at once.\n\n783\n00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,811\nI'll just get rid of that.\n\n784\n00:38:51,811 --> 00:38:56,329\nAnd get into system information,\nis what I'm trying to do.\n\n785\n00:38:56,329 --> 00:39:00,400\nSystem of a Down, all right, well, we're\ngonna listen to some music apparently.\n\n786\n00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,590\nWho's loaded music on this Mac?\n\n787\n00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,434\nNow we have to wonder like,\nis this a show machine?\n\n788\n00:39:04,434 --> 00:39:06,110\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n789\n00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,690\nSystem information.\n\n790\n00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,890\nIf I go to system information,\nI can see what extensions are loaded.\n\n791\n00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,685\nAnd I know I've got at\nleast one extension loaded,\n\n792\n00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,110\ncuz I've got this Logitech keyboard or\nmouse on here and so\n\n793\n00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:20,890\nI can jump in and I can see the extensions\nthat fired up with this system.\n\n794\n00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,640\nSo let me just browse in here.\n\n795\n00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,789\nAnd I'm gonna go under Software >\nExtensions and that's gonna populate.\n\n796\n00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:30,510\nIt takes a minute.\n\n797\n00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,160\nSee how I've got a little\nspinning wheel down here?\n\n798\n00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,249\nIt takes a moment to\nload the extension list.\n\n799\n00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:36,513\nBut once it's loaded,\nI can sort by the Enabled column and\n\n800\n00:39:36,513 --> 00:39:41,550\nI'll be able to see which ones are\nactually loaded into memory and running.\n\n801\n00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,358\nIf I reboot the system and\nI hold down the Shift key,\n\n802\n00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:49,040\nwell that's gonna cause it to\nboot without those extensions.\n\n803\n00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,010\nIt still has to load the core system ones.\n\n804\n00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,520\nLike, I need my keyboard to work,\nfor example, right?\n\n805\n00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,070\nBut it's a much, much smaller set of\nextensions when you do a safe boot.\n\n806\n00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,040\nSo here if I sort by that Loaded column,\n\n807\n00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:05,060\nyou'll see there's actually a lot of\nextensions that are being loaded.\n\n808\n00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,625\nThere's a big list.\n\n809\n00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:09,417\nI could probably count them out,\nbut there's at least 50, right?\n\n810\n00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:14,542\nSo all of these extensions are being\nloaded when I boot the system.\n\n811\n00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:19,900\nThat's a lot of stuff,and any one of these\ncould be causing my system not to boot.\n\n812\n00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,910\nThe more hardware and custom stuff you've\nadded, the more extensions you're going to\n\n813\n00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,660\nhave, and that's all part of the process\nof adding this extra stuff to your system.\n\n814\n00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:34,900\nIf we wanted to boot without those\nextension we just boot holding shift.\n\n815\n00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,350\nNow when you boot up,\nyour Mac actually does some need stuff.\n\n816\n00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,940\nIt knows what extensions\nit normally loads, and so\n\n817\n00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:45,280\nit caches them on the hard drive so that\nwhen you boot up, it will boot faster.\n\n818\n00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,690\nIt's part of the way\nthey speed to process up.\n\n819\n00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,340\nWell when you boot\nthe system holding shift,\n\n820\n00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,130\nwhen you boot to safe boot,\nit flushes that cache also.\n\n821\n00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:57,750\nIt causes those extensions to be reloaded.\n\n822\n00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,380\nRegardless of what's in the cache.\n\n823\n00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,270\nSo that's another benefit we get\nby booting into that safe boot.\n\n824\n00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:06,710\nIf I wanna boot in the safe boot,\nall I need to do is restart, and\n\n825\n00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:10,500\nwhile it's restarting you just\nhold down your shift key.\n\n826\n00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,960\nNow notice my shutdown was doing mode\nstill because I booted in mode but\n\n827\n00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,020\nwhen I reboot I'm not\ndoing command V this time.\n\n828\n00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,290\nI'm just holding down\nshift on the keyboard.\n\n829\n00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,770\nWhen you hold down Shift,\nthe boot gonna look pretty normal.\n\n830\n00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,020\nI see my apple, I see my loading bar.\n\n831\n00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,850\nThings don't look very different.\n\n832\n00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,588\nBut what it's doing is it's booting\nup without those extensions.\n\n833\n00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:35,245\nNow, If there was a third party extension\ncausing the problem, we'll see that.\n\n834\n00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:37,215\nIt's also gonna boot a little bit slower.\n\n835\n00:41:37,215 --> 00:41:38,845\nNotice how long this is taking?\n\n836\n00:41:38,845 --> 00:41:42,775\nThat's because it wiped out the cache,\nand it's having to rebuild that cache,\n\n837\n00:41:42,775 --> 00:41:45,925\nrebuild the extension list, and\nyou can kind of see now how\n\n838\n00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:48,735\nlong it would take your Mac to boot\nif they didn't cache like that.\n\n839\n00:41:48,735 --> 00:41:50,875\nIt's a big performance improvement.\n\n840\n00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,840\nWe can just sit here Twiddle our\nthumbs and eventually it'll boot up.\n\n841\n00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,110\nNow I do want to make one comment\nthat's important for the exam.\n\n842\n00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,140\nI've been talking about safe boot.\n\n843\n00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:04,865\nThere's also something called safe mode,\nand they're very easy to use.\n\n844\n00:42:04,865 --> 00:42:05,655\nAll right.\n\n845\n00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:10,305\nWhen I hold down shift while I\nam booting up, that's safe boot.\n\n846\n00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:11,735\nI'm booting without extensions.\n\n847\n00:42:12,805 --> 00:42:17,465\nWhen I hold down shift,\nwhile logging in, that's safe mode.\n\n848\n00:42:17,465 --> 00:42:21,405\nThat means I log in, and\nit doesn't run my start up items.\n\n849\n00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,075\nWhen you log in as a user,\nyou can have start up items.\n\n850\n00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,275\nPrograms and\nthings that run when you log in.\n\n851\n00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:27,595\nRight?\nIt's convenient,\n\n852\n00:42:27,595 --> 00:42:29,440\nyou get right in to your software.\n\n853\n00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,370\nWell if you hold down Shift while you're\nlogging in, you do safe mode, and\n\n854\n00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,370\nyou log in your user account\nwithout running those programs.\n\n855\n00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,370\nHolding Shift during boot,\nthat's safe boot.\n\n856\n00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:43,240\nHolding down Shift while logging in,\nthat's safe mode.\n\n857\n00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,980\nRight?\nA little variation there between the two.\n\n858\n00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,330\nNow, unfortunately, while I was\nholding down Shift during the boot,\n\n859\n00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,120\none of the extensions that's not\ngonna load is the HDMI extension,\n\n860\n00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,060\nwhich is how I was sharing that screen.\n\n861\n00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,650\nSee how it just went black?\n\n862\n00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,610\nIf I go and look at the actual computer,\nI can see the screen just fine.\n\n863\n00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:02,310\nI see it off set, but\nhere on the cameras I'm not gonna see it.\n\n864\n00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,250\nThat's because it's now\nbooted into that safe boot.\n\n865\n00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:06,790\nAll right.\n\n866\n00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,060\nSo definitely important to understand\nthat difference there for the exam.\n\n867\n00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,410\nSafe boot versus Safe Mode, right?\n\n868\n00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,610\nBut now that system has booted up,\nand we can jump in and\n\n869\n00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,340\nstart to work with it\nwithout those extensions.\n\n870\n00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,540\nNow, let's talk a little bit about what\nhappens after the kernel fires up.\n\n871\n00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,700\nThe kernel fires up, loads all the system,\nloads all the extensions,\n\n872\n00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,660\nand if everything is working right,\nthen, it shows the log in window and\n\n873\n00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,950\nthat's the fourth stage of our boot.\n\n874\n00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,920\nThe first stage was firmware.\n\n875\n00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,010\nThe second stage was booter.\n\n876\n00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:41,620\nThe third stage was the kernel, and\nnow the fourth stage is the log in Window.\n\n877\n00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,210\nThe log in Window is what we see when\nwe first power that system on and\n\n878\n00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,940\nit shows us our user account.\n\n879\n00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,650\nRight.\n\n880\n00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:51,480\nNow the log in Window is actually\na process running on your system.\n\n881\n00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,210\nLet me show you on my laptop.\n\n882\n00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,060\nIf we bring that one up,\n\n883\n00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,060\nthat when your system boots up\nthe kernel fires up the log in Window.\n\n884\n00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,990\nThe log in Window is technically\nthe very first process you run.\n\n885\n00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,840\nWhen you fire up your system,\n\n886\n00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:11,240\nif you fire up the activity monitor, the\nactivity monitor lists all your processes.\n\n887\n00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,140\nAnd see how you've got this\nprocess ID column over here?\n\n888\n00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:19,290\nIf you sort by process ID,\nprocess ID number one is called launchd.\n\n889\n00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,990\nLaunchd is what's launching\nall the various services that\n\n890\n00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:27,430\nare running on the system, and that's\nthe very first thing the kernel fires up.\n\n891\n00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:31,498\nThat's always process ID number one,\nand see how it's running as root?\n\n892\n00:44:31,498 --> 00:44:32,499\nIt runs as root.\n\n893\n00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:34,556\nIt runs as the system.\n\n894\n00:44:34,556 --> 00:44:36,970\nWell, launchd then fires\nup the login Window,\n\n895\n00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:41,110\nand, at the beginning,\nthe login Window is also running as root.\n\n896\n00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:48,400\nBut the instant you log in, the login\nwindow is now running as you, and that\n\n897\n00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,090\nlog in Window process is now responsible\nfor launching any program that you run.\n\n898\n00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,860\nAnd when it runs those\nprograms it runs them as you.\n\n899\n00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,420\nIt's all running under\nyour user credential.\n\n900\n00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,670\nAnd when you log out,\nyou're ending the login Window process.\n\n901\n00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,360\nAnd when you end the login Window process,\n\n902\n00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,940\nit ends every application you were\nrunning, it logs all those out too.\n\n903\n00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,850\nRight?\n\n904\n00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:11,830\nAnd what happens is,\nlaunchd is running in the background, and\n\n905\n00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:17,090\nit sees the login window is now gone,\nand it recreates it as root.\n\n906\n00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,330\nIf I sort by name, and\n\n907\n00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,370\nI look in here I should be able to\nfind that login Window process.\n\n908\n00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:25,440\nLet's see if I can find it,\nit's in here somewhere.\n\n909\n00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,430\nI don't believe it's hidden.\n\n910\n00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:28,850\nThere it is right there.\n\n911\n00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:29,600\nLogin Window.\n\n912\n00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,330\nSee how I've got that login Window and\n\n913\n00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,580\nif I go over here,\nprocess ID 77 that's a pretty low number.\n\n914\n00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,070\nIt's not one, right, but it's pretty low.\n\n915\n00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:41,380\nAnd then the user is\nDeposet it's running as me.\n\n916\n00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,720\nAnd every program I run\nis being run as me.\n\n917\n00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,655\nWhen I launch something like moom\nis my little Window manager that I\n\n918\n00:45:48,655 --> 00:45:52,798\nrun up here in my menu bar, so\nI'm running moom and I can see over here,\n\n919\n00:45:52,798 --> 00:45:57,530\nrunning as Deposet runs as me, so\nit has the same permissions as me.\n\n920\n00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,170\nIt's Launchd in the login\nWindow that are providing that,\n\n921\n00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,580\nnow launchd that's short for\nLaunch Daemon.\n\n922\n00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,400\nIt's a service that runs\nin the background and\n\n923\n00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,650\nin the Unix world services\nare called daemons.\n\n924\n00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,940\nAnd so it runs in the background and\nthen it performs those various actions.\n\n925\n00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,820\nIn this case, launching the login window.\n\n926\n00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,080\nAnd if I logout,\nthe login window goes away.\n\n927\n00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,980\nAll the applications tied to me,\nanything over here that\n\n928\n00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,985\nsays Deposet user goes away, and\nthen it goes back to just launchd running.\n\n929\n00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:29,010\nLaunchd is running as root, so\nit starts the login window as root.\n\n930\n00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:31,120\nAnd then I log in and\nit reassigns that to me again, right?\n\n931\n00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,470\nThat process is happening\nin the background.\n\n932\n00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:36,180\nThat's that last stage\nof the boot process.\n\n933\n00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,310\nYou see the login Window and you login.\n\n934\n00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:43,810\nIf the login Window doesn't appear,\nthen that almost always indicates either\n\n935\n00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:48,210\ndamaged permissions on the hard drive or\ndamaged files on the hard drive.\n\n936\n00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,920\nDamaged permissions, and damaged files for\n\n937\n00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,160\nthat matter we can fix\nwith a disc utility.\n\n938\n00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,280\nWorst case scenario we might\nhave to reinstall Mac OS.\n\n939\n00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,850\nThat, that would be worst case scenario.\n\n940\n00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,550\nBut usually a fixed\npermissions will knock it out.\n\n941\n00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,436\nAll right, so that's the user process.\n\n942\n00:47:02,436 --> 00:47:06,338\nNow once the login Window logs in,\nit changes over to my role,\n\n943\n00:47:06,338 --> 00:47:10,482\nand then it starts running all\nthe programs that run when I log in.\n\n944\n00:47:10,482 --> 00:47:12,457\nNow what runs when I log in?\n\n945\n00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:14,780\nWell, there's actually quite\na few different things.\n\n946\n00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,320\nThere's mostly what we call log in items.\n\n947\n00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,010\nIf you go into your system preferences,\nthen you go under users and\n\n948\n00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:25,600\ngroups, and you take a look at a user,\nso like here is Don Pozette.\n\n949\n00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,160\nThis is my account.\n\n950\n00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,920\nUnder my account I have, log in items and\n\n951\n00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,860\nif I choose log in items I'll see all\nthe things that run when my system runs.\n\n952\n00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:38,580\nWhen I turn my system on,\nit runs Moon and Dropbox, Viscosity,\n\n953\n00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:42,640\nUndark all these different utilities\nthat I run and I use on a regular basis.\n\n954\n00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,540\nI runs them.\n\n955\n00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,710\nSome might be hidden,\n\n956\n00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,960\nlike the Google Chrome system that\nruns in the background, that's hidden.\n\n957\n00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,790\nBut the other ones run, I see them,\nI know they're running.\n\n958\n00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:51,320\nAll right?\n\n959\n00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,940\nIf I don't want them to run, like maybe\nI don't want Disk Warrior to run.\n\n960\n00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,460\nI don't run that very often, so I don't\nneed it running every time I boot up.\n\n961\n00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,916\nI can come in and remove that, and\n\n962\n00:47:58,916 --> 00:48:01,000\nnot it's not gonna run\nwhen my system boots up.\n\n963\n00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:01,670\nRight?\n\n964\n00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,917\nOr iTunes, I can't remember the last\ntime I the last time I launched iTunes.\n\n965\n00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:05,667\nSo I might wanna remove that.\n\n966\n00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:08,561\nThese things help my system to\nboot a little more quickly, or\n\n967\n00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:09,708\nto log in more quickly.\n\n968\n00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:10,750\nIt doesn't effect boot at all.\n\n969\n00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,667\nIt's just your log in.\n\n970\n00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:16,458\nAll right, so I can start to set some\nof those, and then we're in business.\n\n971\n00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:19,020\nBut what if I can't even login?\n\n972\n00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:23,080\nWhat if I punch in my password, and\nit starts to login, and then it reboots?\n\n973\n00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,778\nIt could be one of these login items\nthat's causing that reboot, and\n\n974\n00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,155\nthat's where safe Mmode comes in, right?\n\n975\n00:48:29,155 --> 00:48:30,790\nLet me show you safe mode.\n\n976\n00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:36,296\nI'm gonna close out of this,\nand I'm gonna log out.\n\n977\n00:48:36,296 --> 00:48:39,816\nNow when I log out,\nI'm ending my login window process, and\n\n978\n00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:43,834\nmy login window is going to be closing\nall the programs I was running.\n\n979\n00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:46,996\nNow if autosave is turned on all\nthose programs will come right back\n\n980\n00:48:46,996 --> 00:48:48,416\nup when I log back in, right?\n\n981\n00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:52,850\nBut if autosave is off then when I go\nto login I just get a new session.\n\n982\n00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:56,160\nEither way my login items will run.\n\n983\n00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,790\nSo if I punch in my password,\nI can expect Dropbox,\n\n984\n00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:03,890\nMoom, all those other\nutilities to be running.\n\n985\n00:49:04,998 --> 00:49:07,607\nBut I'm gonna hold down\nthe Shift key on my keyboard and\n\n986\n00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:09,261\nI'm gonna hit that login button.\n\n987\n00:49:09,261 --> 00:49:12,766\nSo I'm holding Shift and\nwhile you're holding Shift,\n\n988\n00:49:12,766 --> 00:49:15,163\nit's gonna do safe mode, all right?\n\n989\n00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:17,800\nWell shoot, it's supposed to do safe mode.\n\n990\n00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,540\nIt didn't.\n\n991\n00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,202\nI know it didn't do safe mode for\ntwo reasons.\n\n992\n00:49:20,202 --> 00:49:22,610\nOne, I see my programs ran, right?\n\n993\n00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:28,035\nSo I can see my login items up here,\nthey ran even though I was holding Shift.\n\n994\n00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:31,752\nAnd the other thing is when you boot into\nsafe boot and then safe mode on top of\n\n995\n00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:35,538\nthat, you'll actually have it where\nit's written up here in the menu bar.\n\n996\n00:49:35,538 --> 00:49:38,657\nIt'll let you know that\nit booted into safe mode.\n\n997\n00:49:38,657 --> 00:49:43,890\nSo I'm kinda missing a few things, or\nactually, wait a minute I think I did.\n\n998\n00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:47,920\nSo Moom and Dropbox,\nthose are some of my login items.\n\n999\n00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,560\nThey're not up here in my menu bar,\nthey actually didn't run.\n\n1000\n00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,800\nLooking up here, I don't see those items.\n\n1001\n00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,245\nSome of these other ones ran, but\nthey must be running as extensions, or\n\n1002\n00:49:56,245 --> 00:49:57,327\nfrom somewhere else.\n\n1003\n00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,618\nLogin items aren't the only thing\nthat run when you log in, right?\n\n1004\n00:50:00,618 --> 00:50:05,138\nWhen I went under System Preferences and\nUser Accounts and I looked at my user,\n\n1005\n00:50:05,138 --> 00:50:07,450\nI went to login items, right?\n\n1006\n00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:10,680\nUp here I've got jump desktop,\nI've got splash top,\n\n1007\n00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,980\nthose are some remote programs they use.\n\n1008\n00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,780\nI've got anti-sleep that\nkeeps my laptop awake.\n\n1009\n00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:17,204\nThose aren't showing up in this list,\nall right?\n\n1010\n00:50:17,204 --> 00:50:19,327\nViscosity is, that's my VPN client.\n\n1011\n00:50:19,327 --> 00:50:20,830\nI don't see it up here.\n\n1012\n00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:23,370\nDropbox, that's my file share, right?\n\n1013\n00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:24,370\nI don't see that up here.\n\n1014\n00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:27,700\nMoom, that was the little sigma type\nsymbol, I don't see that up here.\n\n1015\n00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,590\nSo they didn't run.\n\n1016\n00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:32,500\nMy login items didn't run as expected,\nbut these guys did.\n\n1017\n00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,360\nWhere did they come from, right?\n\n1018\n00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,570\nWell, they came from a different place.\n\n1019\n00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:39,290\nThere's several different\nplaces things can go\n\n1020\n00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:41,790\nto cause them to run when you log in.\n\n1021\n00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:45,430\nThe login items are tied to\nme as an individual user.\n\n1022\n00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,570\nBut some of these other\nones like anti-sleep and\n\n1023\n00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:51,870\nmy remote desktop stuff,\nthose are tied to the system as a whole.\n\n1024\n00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:54,820\nAnd so those are actually\nbeing launched by the system.\n\n1025\n00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:58,780\nAnd so I would need to do a safe\nboot to make those not load, right?\n\n1026\n00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,520\nOther things might be being\nlaunched by a legacy system.\n\n1027\n00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,950\nWe used to have what were\ncalled startup agents.\n\n1028\n00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,040\nAnd you shouldn't use\nstartup agents anymore.\n\n1029\n00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,830\nThey're really something that's gone.\n\n1030\n00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,510\nBut the Mac still supports it, and\n\n1031\n00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:13,740\nthere is some third party software\nout there that can still use them.\n\n1032\n00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:18,033\nIf you wanna find them, let's see if\nI can remember where they're hidden.\n\n1033\n00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,238\nLet's see.\n\n1034\n00:51:19,238 --> 00:51:21,900\nThey should just be right in our\nlibrary if I remember, right?\n\n1035\n00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,498\nSo let's go into /Library/StartupItems.\n\n1036\n00:51:26,498 --> 00:51:27,530\nThere we go.\n\n1037\n00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:32,526\nAnd in startup items we can see things\nthat also run when we start up and\n\n1038\n00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:36,170\nI'm looking at my\nglobal/Library folder here.\n\n1039\n00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,503\nAnd I don't have any, let's check my user.\n\n1040\n00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:45,949\nSo I'll go into\n/Users/dpezet/Library/StartupItems.\n\n1041\n00:51:45,949 --> 00:51:49,779\nAnd actually it looks like I don't\neven have a StartupItems folder.\n\n1042\n00:51:49,779 --> 00:51:51,451\nLet me make sure my username\nis actually Don Pezet.\n\n1043\n00:51:51,451 --> 00:51:52,711\nIt might be, nope, it is, yep.\n\n1044\n00:51:52,711 --> 00:51:55,455\nSo I don't even have a StartupItems\nfolder in there, and\n\n1045\n00:51:55,455 --> 00:51:57,120\nthen the system can have one also.\n\n1046\n00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,743\nSo I'll go ahead and check that one.\n\n1047\n00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:04,461\nAnd it does.\n\n1048\n00:52:04,461 --> 00:52:08,037\nAnd we'll take a look and it's empty too,\nso it's not any of those.\n\n1049\n00:52:08,037 --> 00:52:10,206\nSo these must just be\nrunning as extensions, right,\n\n1050\n00:52:10,206 --> 00:52:12,500\nthat are firing up when\nmy system fires up.\n\n1051\n00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,396\nIf I wanna hide those,\nwell in that scenario,\n\n1052\n00:52:15,396 --> 00:52:18,530\nI'm going to have to boot into safe mode,\nright?\n\n1053\n00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:19,739\nSo I'm gonna do that.\n\n1054\n00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:22,520\nI'm gonna go ahead and reboot my laptop\ninto save mode so that we can see it.\n\n1055\n00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:28,300\nNow when I do that I've got to\nhold down Shift while booting up.\n\n1056\n00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:33,040\nAnd I've got to hold down Shift while\nlogging in, and then I get both.\n\n1057\n00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,690\nI get the safe boot with no extensions,\nand I get the safe mode login.\n\n1058\n00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:40,260\nAnd when that happens, that's when I'll\nsee that little menu message up here at\n\n1059\n00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:43,240\nthe top right that actually\nsays that I'm in safe mode.\n\n1060\n00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,763\nSo I get that visual cue that\nlets me know that happened, so\n\n1061\n00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:47,990\nwe'll get to see that\na little more aggressively.\n\n1062\n00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:51,296\nNow, unfortunately the way I've\ngot my laptop hooked up right now,\n\n1063\n00:52:51,296 --> 00:52:53,750\nif I boot that way I'm gonna\nlose my desktop share.\n\n1064\n00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,080\nSo let's do this.\n\n1065\n00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,381\nLet's stop and take a break and\nduring the break I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n1066\n00:52:57,381 --> 00:52:58,246\nreboot it holding Shift.\n\n1067\n00:52:58,246 --> 00:53:01,537\nAnd what we'll probably have to do, I\nmight have to point a camera at my screen\n\n1068\n00:53:01,537 --> 00:53:03,630\nto actually get it to show up well for\nyou, guys.\n\n1069\n00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,410\nSo, let's stop and take a break.\n\n1070\n00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,970\nI'll sort that out and when we get back,\n\n1071\n00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:11,110\nwe'll get a chance to see that safe\nboot and safe mode combined, all right?\n\n1072\n00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:11,614\nStay tuned.\n\n1073\n00:53:11,614 --> 00:53:12,823\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n1074\n00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:19,792\n[MUSIC]\n\n1075\n00:53:19,792 --> 00:53:21,435\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1076\n00:53:21,435 --> 00:53:23,785\nSo during the break,\nI rebooted my laptop holding Shift.\n\n1077\n00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:26,595\nAnd we had to adjust our video feed\na little bit to get this to show up.\n\n1078\n00:53:26,595 --> 00:53:29,765\nBut I've got up on the screen,\nmy laptop now.\n\n1079\n00:53:29,765 --> 00:53:32,445\nAnd I've done a safe boot.\n\n1080\n00:53:32,445 --> 00:53:34,665\nNow when you do a safe boot,\nit's really easy to spot you did it.\n\n1081\n00:53:34,665 --> 00:53:37,645\nSee this red keyword right here,\nit's telling me safe boot.\n\n1082\n00:53:37,645 --> 00:53:39,410\nI know that I've done that.\n\n1083\n00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:42,820\nIt's booted without all\nthose extra extensions.\n\n1084\n00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,810\nAnd now what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna log in as myself and\n\n1085\n00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:51,410\nI'm gonna tell it to do a safe mode login.\n\n1086\n00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:54,550\nSo I'm gonna hold Shift while\nI click the log in button.\n\n1087\n00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:57,380\nSo now I'm loading without\nany custom extensions, and\n\n1088\n00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:01,120\nI'm loading without any startup items or\nlogin items firing up.\n\n1089\n00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,010\nNow did you notice how my screen\nflickered really bad there?\n\n1090\n00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:08,490\nWell, it actually did that on my laptop,\nthat's not a software problem.\n\n1091\n00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,590\nWell, I guess technically\nit is a software problem.\n\n1092\n00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,600\nIt's booted without the advanced\nvideo card drivers.\n\n1093\n00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,050\nSo it's using really,\nreally basic video card drivers right now.\n\n1094\n00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:20,330\nAnd so I've lost some functionality\nthat I would normally have.\n\n1095\n00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:23,490\nAll of the advanced\nextensions are not loaded.\n\n1096\n00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:25,160\nAlso, look at my startup items.\n\n1097\n00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:29,860\nEarlier, I saw Splashtop and Moom and\nall those other programs I used.\n\n1098\n00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:30,830\nThey're all gone.\n\n1099\n00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,740\nNone of them started up, right?\n\n1100\n00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,040\nNow they started up earlier,\n\n1101\n00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,010\neven when I did a safe mode\ncuz they weren't a login item.\n\n1102\n00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,510\nThey were something else, right?\n\n1103\n00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,210\nAnd we checked for startup items.\n\n1104\n00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,260\nI never did actually find them.\n\n1105\n00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,660\nThere's a few other\nplaces where they can be.\n\n1106\n00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,373\nThey could be, what are they called?\n\n1107\n00:54:46,373 --> 00:54:49,116\nWhat are they, launch agents,\nlaunch services?\n\n1108\n00:54:49,116 --> 00:54:53,370\nLet's test it out cuz it's gonna\nbug me all day if I can't remember.\n\n1109\n00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:54,410\nOops!\n\n1110\n00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:56,180\nYes, I wanted to look\nup the word terminal.\n\n1111\n00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,034\nThat's perfect.\n\n1112\n00:54:57,034 --> 00:55:01,770\nOh, [LAUGH] I've done a safe boot.\n\n1113\n00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,976\nAnd one of the things\nthat gets disabled and\n\n1114\n00:55:03,976 --> 00:55:07,030\nflushed when you do a safe\nboot is the Spotlight cache.\n\n1115\n00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:09,890\nAnd so Spotlight is not searching and\nfinding the terminal command for me.\n\n1116\n00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,700\nSo I'll just lock it from my bar here.\n\n1117\n00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,460\nNotice my fonts, right?\n\n1118\n00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,529\nMy font here inside of\nthe terminal is now different.\n\n1119\n00:55:16,529 --> 00:55:20,225\nThere's a lot of stuff that's\ndifferent because the system has\n\n1120\n00:55:20,225 --> 00:55:24,403\nkind of reset me to this very basic,\nguaranteed-to-work type motor,\n\n1121\n00:55:24,403 --> 00:55:27,226\nshould be guaranteed to work type mode,\nright?\n\n1122\n00:55:27,226 --> 00:55:30,470\nSo I'm gonna jump over into Library,\nand I can't remember the name of this.\n\n1123\n00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:31,480\nIt's launch something.\n\n1124\n00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,510\nLet's take a look here and\nsee if we can find it.\n\n1125\n00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:36,380\nThere we go, launch agents.\n\n1126\n00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:39,870\nLaunch agents, those are other things that\ncan start up when your computer starts or\n\n1127\n00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:41,210\nwhen you log in.\n\n1128\n00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:46,680\nAnd so, I'll bet,\nwe find those guys hidden right in there.\n\n1129\n00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,530\nAnd sure enough, there we go.\n\n1130\n00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:52,190\nI can see com.splashtop.streamer.\n\n1131\n00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:53,000\nThat's Splashtop.\n\n1132\n00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,210\nI've got TeamViewer,\nsome other software, Chromium.\n\n1133\n00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:57,630\nYeah, here is the other software.\n\n1134\n00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:01,042\nMy Logitech Control Center,\nall buried away under Launch Agents.\n\n1135\n00:56:01,042 --> 00:56:05,254\nNow, that launch LaunchAgents\nfolder I went to the global one,\n\n1136\n00:56:05,254 --> 00:56:07,206\n/Library/LaunchAgents.\n\n1137\n00:56:07,206 --> 00:56:11,543\nThat means it runs for everybody,\nit's global, right, not just me as a user.\n\n1138\n00:56:11,543 --> 00:56:14,530\nThat's why going into safe mode\ndidn't stop those from running.\n\n1139\n00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,917\nBut going into safe boot did.\n\n1140\n00:56:16,917 --> 00:56:21,486\nSo it's often that you need to do\na combination of the two, safe boot and\n\n1141\n00:56:21,486 --> 00:56:26,363\nsafe mode, to ensure that everything\nthat's third party is not starting,\n\n1142\n00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:29,110\nand that you get in and you can test out.\n\n1143\n00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:31,140\nThat's one way that we can\ngo about checking that and\n\n1144\n00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,100\nmaking sure that we're okay.\n\n1145\n00:56:33,582 --> 00:56:36,200\nAll right, so\nonce we're in here and we're up and\n\n1146\n00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,880\ngoing, I also mentioned\nthose caches that happen.\n\n1147\n00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,740\nThe caches that get flushed out.\n\n1148\n00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:44,764\nSo those caches with cache extensions,\na lot of that stuff gets stuck into\n\n1149\n00:56:44,764 --> 00:56:49,480\n/library/caches, that folder right there.\n\n1150\n00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,734\nAnd if you pull up a list you'll see\nthere's all sorts of junk in here,\n\n1151\n00:56:52,734 --> 00:56:56,300\naudio components, and other things,\nyour extensions get cached.\n\n1152\n00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,460\nAnd so when you boot into safe mode,\na lot of that clears out.\n\n1153\n00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,960\nOr when you do safe boot,\na lot of that gets cleared out.\n\n1154\n00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,750\nSo those are things that get wiped,\nand kinda helps you to start that out.\n\n1155\n00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:08,730\nIf, however, you're still having problems,\nnotice how everything doesn't get wiped.\n\n1156\n00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,210\nI got plenty of stuff in there.\n\n1157\n00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:13,990\nIf you're still trying to figure out\nwhat's causing the problem, you can go and\n\n1158\n00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,620\nmanually wipe these folders.\n\n1159\n00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,885\nOf course if you can't boot up,\nthat's not going to help you much.\n\n1160\n00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:20,720\nAnd that's where target\nmode comes in pretty handy.\n\n1161\n00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,590\nIf you boot your Mac while\nholding down the letter T,\n\n1162\n00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,710\nyou'll boot into target mode.\n\n1163\n00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:27,800\nAnd when you're in target mode,\nyou can run a Thunderbolt or\n\n1164\n00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,780\nFireWire cable between your Mac and\nanother Mac.\n\n1165\n00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,590\nAnd your Mac will just\nshow up as a hard drive.\n\n1166\n00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:36,800\nAnd you can browse into it, and\nyou can clear out some of these folders.\n\n1167\n00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,970\nSo the folders that I usually like to wipe\nout if I'm having problems like this,\n\n1168\n00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:44,980\nthey're /library/caches,\nthis folder right here.\n\n1169\n00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:49,370\nYou can also do /library/preferences.\n\n1170\n00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:54,080\nNow, a lot of people cringe when\nI say this /library/preferences.\n\n1171\n00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,950\nIt's got all the preferences in there for\n\n1172\n00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:59,120\nyour system as well as a lot of\nyour third party applications.\n\n1173\n00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:03,990\nIf you wipe that out it's gonna\nreset all those settings to default.\n\n1174\n00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:06,960\nWhen you boot back up it's going to\ncreate all new preference files.\n\n1175\n00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,610\nSo,if it's safe to do.\n\n1176\n00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,990\nYou can safely wipe out everything\nin /library/preferences and\n\n1177\n00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,940\nthe system will be fine.\n\n1178\n00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,900\nBut you'll have to go back and\nreset all the preferences,\n\n1179\n00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,170\nanything you had customized and changed.\n\n1180\n00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,950\nAnd if you're like me, there's things that\nyou changed the very first day you got\n\n1181\n00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:23,740\nthat computer and\nyou don't remember where they are now.\n\n1182\n00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,060\nSo it's a bit of work, but\n\n1183\n00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:28,480\nit's a better alternative than not\nbeing able to use your computer, right?\n\n1184\n00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,070\nSo you can boot into target mode.\n\n1185\n00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:33,450\nYou can wipe out /library/caches.\n\n1186\n00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:36,170\nAnd you can wipe out\n/libraries/preferences,\n\n1187\n00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:40,670\nand when you reboot they'll both be\nrebuilt, and they'll be nice and\n\n1188\n00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:43,260\nclean and hopefully that will\nsolve your issues there.\n\n1189\n00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,450\nThere is one more thing,\none more place that you can wipe out, and\n\n1190\n00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,800\nthis is another one that will\njust be rebuilt on boot.\n\n1191\n00:58:52,800 --> 00:59:00,980\nAnd it's /libraries/preferences/system\nconfiguration, all right?\n\n1192\n00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:03,450\nDid I not type, I didn't type cd.\n\n1193\n00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,946\nFixed my command, there.\n\n1194\n00:59:07,268 --> 00:59:08,870\nAll right.\n\n1195\n00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:10,940\nThere's the path, right there.\n\n1196\n00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,500\nSo it's\n/library/preferences/SystemConfiguration.\n\n1197\n00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:19,240\nAnd those are preferences that deal\nwith the operating system itself.\n\n1198\n00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,530\nAnd if you delete everything in there,\nsame thing.\n\n1199\n00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:25,410\nWhen you reboot they'll get recreated,\nthey'll all be put back to Apple default.\n\n1200\n00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:28,600\nSo there's a quick way to reset those\npreferences if you change something in\n\n1201\n00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,530\nthe preferences is causing you not\nto boot or causing odd behavior.\n\n1202\n00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,030\nThis'll reset it.\n\n1203\n00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:35,150\nCouple of different places we can go and\nwipe those out.\n\n1204\n00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:39,213\nAnd again I'll have those paths in\nthe show notes so you can seem em.\n\n1205\n00:59:42,754 --> 00:59:46,500\nNot too much to worry about there,\nthat's basically it.\n\n1206\n00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,340\nThe other caches are flushed just\nwhen you boot into safe mode.\n\n1207\n00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:53,890\nNow I'm in safe mode right now, and I'm\ngoing to stay in safe mode until I reboot.\n\n1208\n00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:59,590\nSo if I log out, so I'm just logging out\nas me, and going back to my login window.\n\n1209\n00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,810\nSee I'm still in safe boot mode.\n\n1210\n01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,590\nThe only way to get out of safe boot\nmode is to go ahead and reboot.\n\n1211\n01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:09,940\nSo that's pretty much it for\ntroubleshooting that final process.\n\n1212\n01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,996\nFor the exam definitely\nremember the four steps.\n\n1213\n01:00:11,996 --> 01:00:15,499\nYou've got the firmware,\nthe bootroms, the other name for\n\n1214\n01:00:15,499 --> 01:00:20,340\nit, but the firmware that kicks on\nwhen you first turn your computer on.\n\n1215\n01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:24,030\nThen you've got the booter, which is\nfinding the operating system to boot.\n\n1216\n01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:27,060\nThen you've got the kernel,\nthat's actually the operating system, and\n\n1217\n01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,050\nstarting all the various components there.\n\n1218\n01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:32,730\nAnd finally, we have the login window,\nwhat's creating our user session and\n\n1219\n01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,700\nactually running our program for us.\n\n1220\n01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:38,530\nAnd at each step along that journey,\nwe had different tools that were\n\n1221\n01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:41,360\navailable for troubleshooting the system\nand finding out what was wrong.\n\n1222\n01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:48,880\nThe last thing that we need to mention for\nthis troubleshooting episode is sleep.\n\n1223\n01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,850\nNot our personal sleep,\nalthough that is a nice thing to have, but\n\n1224\n01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:54,240\nthe sleep modes inside of Mac OS.\n\n1225\n01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:58,690\nWhen you run a Mac, by default,\nthe way that it's shipped out of the box,\n\n1226\n01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:01,870\nit's set to go to sleep periodically,\nand what do I mean by sleep?\n\n1227\n01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:05,620\nWell, if the computer sits idle for\nlong enough,\n\n1228\n01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:10,590\nit will not power off completely,\nbut it will power down a good bit.\n\n1229\n01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:13,870\nIt'll take a lot of stuff like\nthe hard rives and stop spinning them.\n\n1230\n01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:17,150\nThe CPU, it will drop it to\na lower power level, slow it down.\n\n1231\n01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:20,000\nIt does all these things to conserve\nenergy while the computer is not\n\n1232\n01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,550\nbeing used.\n\n1233\n01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:24,090\nAnd for\nthe most part that's not a big deal.\n\n1234\n01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:27,860\nBut there are somethings we can tweak\nabout that sleep operation to change\n\n1235\n01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:31,430\nthe way that is works, and I want to show\nyou a couple of those that might creep up.\n\n1236\n01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,446\nAnd I'll just stay in safe boot mode here,\n\n1237\n01:01:33,446 --> 01:01:36,950\nI don't need anything that's\nout of the ordinary for this.\n\n1238\n01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:40,590\nBut oh,\nactually what are my power options.\n\n1239\n01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:42,350\nBut we'll see if my options\nare all showing up right.\n\n1240\n01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:47,800\nSo if I go into my System Preferences,\nyou can go into Energy Saver, and\n\n1241\n01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,410\nthat's where you're gonna\nsee your sleep options.\n\n1242\n01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:53,590\nAnd you'll see like, my turn display\noff is set to never when I'm on a power\n\n1243\n01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:55,140\nadapter, which they absolutely hate.\n\n1244\n01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:58,920\nBut, on yours, it will normally be set to\nsomething like 20 minutes or 30 minutes\n\n1245\n01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,750\nand if you haven't used the computer in\nthat time, it will turn the display off.\n\n1246\n01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:05,883\nAnd then you'll see where you have\nsome other options here like prevent\n\n1247\n01:02:05,883 --> 01:02:09,550\nthe computer from sleeping\nautomatically when the display is off.\n\n1248\n01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:13,420\nBy default, if the display goes off,\nthe system goes to sleep.\n\n1249\n01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:16,880\nNow, if you are trying to run\nsome programs in the background,\n\n1250\n01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,510\nthey should keep the system awake, but\nif they weren't programmed correctly then\n\n1251\n01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:24,490\nthey might go to sleep also, and that\ncauses the system to have some problems.\n\n1252\n01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,920\nWhen you're not able to run these\nthings while the system is asleep.\n\n1253\n01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,060\nYou can tell it to stay awake or\n\n1254\n01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:33,480\nyou can update your software to\nmake sure that it's supported.\n\n1255\n01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,100\nBut you've got a few other\noptions that are in here,\n\n1256\n01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,730\nlike put hard disc to sleep when possible.\n\n1257\n01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:39,740\nSome people like that some people don't.\n\n1258\n01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:43,050\nIf you put your hard discs to sleep and\nthey're magnetic discs, the ones that\n\n1259\n01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:47,340\nspin, the first time you go to access them\nagain it's got to spin them back up, and\n\n1260\n01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,980\nthat takes time so it makes your system\na little slow to come out of sleep mode.\n\n1261\n01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,140\nSome people don't like that.\n\n1262\n01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,890\nSo you can turn that option off and\nthe hard drives will stay awake.\n\n1263\n01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,450\nYou've got wake for network access.\n\n1264\n01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:02,320\nWhat if you've got back to my Mac turned\non, and your computer goes to sleep?\n\n1265\n01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,310\nWell if your computer's asleep, you\ncan't remote into it to see your screen.\n\n1266\n01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:07,070\nYou can't use back to my Mac.\n\n1267\n01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:11,020\nBut, if you turn that on,\nnow when you fire up back to my Mac,\n\n1268\n01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,470\nyour computer'll wake up automatically.\n\n1269\n01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,670\nSimilar to that is power nap.\n\n1270\n01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:19,420\nPower nap says while we're asleep,\nfrom time to time the computer can wake up\n\n1271\n01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:23,310\nto run time machine backups, check for\nnew email and all those other resources.\n\n1272\n01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,660\nSo those are things that kind of change\nthe way that that sleep mode works,\n\n1273\n01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:27,760\nkind of waking that system up.\n\n1274\n01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,430\nAnd then always remember that\nyou've got different options for\n\n1275\n01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:32,680\nbattery versus power adapter.\n\n1276\n01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,440\nWhen you're on a wall socket versus\nwhen you're running on battery,\n\n1277\n01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,600\nthen you might wanna be more restrictive\nwhen you're on battery than when you're\n\n1278\n01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,660\non a wall adapter.\n\n1279\n01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,530\nSo little variations there.\n\n1280\n01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:47,220\nNotice that when you're on battery,\nwake for network access isn't an option.\n\n1281\n01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:51,734\nThat's because normally when you're on\nbattery, you're on wireless networks, and\n\n1282\n01:03:51,734 --> 01:03:55,882\nwhen you go to sleep, the wireless adapter\nis one of the things that consumes a lot\n\n1283\n01:03:55,882 --> 01:04:00,167\nof power, so it goes to sleep too and it's\nnot able to wake on the network activity.\n\n1284\n01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:02,495\nSo those are some of the basics settings\nwe need to be aware of outside of\n\n1285\n01:04:02,495 --> 01:04:03,293\nthe power management.\n\n1286\n01:04:03,293 --> 01:04:06,451\nNow there's one other thing that\ncan cause the problems, and\n\n1287\n01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:10,292\nthis really started back with Mavericks,\nbut it's the same in Yosemite.\n\n1288\n01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:14,500\nThere's something inside\nof Yosemite called App Nap.\n\n1289\n01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,928\nAnd what App Nap does is it says\nthat there's a program running in\n\n1290\n01:04:17,928 --> 01:04:21,989\nthe background and it's been idle for\nawhile and we haven't been using it,\n\n1291\n01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:24,167\nit can actually sleep the application.\n\n1292\n01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:26,236\nAnd it takes the memory for\nthat application and\n\n1293\n01:04:26,236 --> 01:04:29,545\nit kind of writes it to the hard drive and\nit puts that application to sleep and\n\n1294\n01:04:29,545 --> 01:04:30,542\nit stops responding.\n\n1295\n01:04:30,542 --> 01:04:32,793\nWell, I work with virtual machines a lot,\nand\n\n1296\n01:04:32,793 --> 01:04:36,548\nI would have this problem where virtual\nmachines would start to go to sleep and\n\n1297\n01:04:36,548 --> 01:04:39,583\nI would try and remote into them,\nand I couldn't get to them.\n\n1298\n01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:43,449\nIf you have background software\nthat you want to run all the time,\n\n1299\n01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:47,560\nthat you don't want to go to sleep,\nyou'll want to turn off App Nap.\n\n1300\n01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,860\nIf I browse on my hard drive and\n\n1301\n01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:54,360\ngo into applications, let's see,\nwhat would be a good application for me.\n\n1302\n01:04:54,360 --> 01:05:00,150\nMaybe something like,\nI know what I wanna do and I don't see it.\n\n1303\n01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:02,220\nSo we'll say something like Google Chrome,\nright?\n\n1304\n01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:04,890\nMaybe I have Chrome running and\nit's checking my email and\n\n1305\n01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:08,630\ndoing on-screen notifications, so I always\nwanna get those on-screen notifications.\n\n1306\n01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:11,988\nWell, if it goes to sleep,\nI wont get those on-screen notifications.\n\n1307\n01:05:11,988 --> 01:05:16,280\nSo I can choose Chrome and I can pull up\nit's information, you can just right click\n\n1308\n01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:22,325\nand do get information or Ctrl+Click or\nwhatever it is you wanna do to get there.\n\n1309\n01:05:22,325 --> 01:05:23,940\nCmd+I is what I did.\n\n1310\n01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:27,860\nAnd inside you'll see that option\nright here, Prevent App Nap.\n\n1311\n01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:31,020\nSo if you have a program that is\nintended to be running all the time.\n\n1312\n01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:33,070\nAnd for some reason, every now and\nthen, you can't get to it or\n\n1313\n01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:34,280\nit's not responding.\n\n1314\n01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,810\nIt might be because it's\ngone into App Nap mode.\n\n1315\n01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:38,370\nAnd you can turn that off for\nit, and now when you run it,\n\n1316\n01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:41,030\nit'll just stay awake all the time and\nit'll always be available.\n\n1317\n01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:44,320\nIt's a problem that I've bumped into\nmore than my fair share of times.\n\n1318\n01:05:46,085 --> 01:05:50,375\nThe other thing about sleep mode is when\nyou go into sleep mode your Mac will take\n\n1319\n01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:53,505\nwhat's in memory and\nwrite it to the hard drive.\n\n1320\n01:05:53,505 --> 01:05:56,925\nAnd it's doing that, actually hang on,\nit only does that if you have a battery.\n\n1321\n01:05:56,925 --> 01:05:58,565\nIf you don't have a battery\nit doesn't worry about it.\n\n1322\n01:05:58,565 --> 01:06:01,445\nBut if you have a battery when\nyour system goes to sleep,\n\n1323\n01:06:01,445 --> 01:06:03,845\nit'll write whats in\nRAM to the hard drive.\n\n1324\n01:06:03,845 --> 01:06:07,680\nAnd the reason it's doing that is if your\nbattery runs out, what's gonna happen to\n\n1325\n01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,030\nyour system, it's gonna power off, and\nthen it wants you to loose your data.\n\n1326\n01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:13,400\nSo then, what happens is if\nyou power your laptop on,\n\n1327\n01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,450\nit will see that memory\nwritten into the hard drive,\n\n1328\n01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:20,140\nit will reload it into RAM, and\nyou'll resume right where you left off.\n\n1329\n01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:24,020\nThat's called hibernate, and\nhibernation is a default thing,\n\n1330\n01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,160\nit's turned on it's part of sleep mode.\n\n1331\n01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,240\nIf you're on a battery,\nit's supports hibernate.\n\n1332\n01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,870\nIf you're on a desktop it doesn't.\n\n1333\n01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:34,880\nIt goes on that low power mode, and you're\non a wall socket so you've always got some\n\n1334\n01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,330\npower, unless you have a power outage,\nin which case it just goes off, right.\n\n1335\n01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:40,460\nYou don't need hibernate on a desktop, but\n\n1336\n01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:44,470\non a laptop you do because a laptop\nit doesn't have continuous power.\n\n1337\n01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:47,570\nIf that power runs out hibernate\nwill make sure your data's safe.\n\n1338\n01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,940\nAll right, so\nthose are a few things to think about.\n\n1339\n01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,420\nLet's see, what else is there?\n\n1340\n01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,130\nI think that's really about it.\n\n1341\n01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:59,370\nI don't think I have\nanything else on that one.\n\n1342\n01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:04,590\nIt is possible that your computer\ngoes to sleep, your laptop or\n\n1343\n01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:07,760\nwhatever runs out of battery power and\nit goes into hibernate mode.\n\n1344\n01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:12,840\nAnd something about that memory was\nwritten to the system and it's bad.\n\n1345\n01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,280\nAnd it won't boot up.\n\n1346\n01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,150\nAnd it can't boot, right?\n\n1347\n01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:18,390\nThe way to flush that is safe boot.\n\n1348\n01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:20,100\nJust hold Shift while you're booting.\n\n1349\n01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:23,869\nIf you hold Shift while you're booting,\nit throws out your extension cache and\n\n1350\n01:07:23,869 --> 01:07:28,190\nit throws out whatever sleep mode, or\nwhatever hibernate might have cached also.\n\n1351\n01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:31,040\nAnd it gives you a fresh,\nclean, boot, all right?\n\n1352\n01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,130\nIt'll take a lot longer to boot,\nand it is Safe Boot.\n\n1353\n01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:35,280\nOnce you're done you gotta reboot again,\nso\n\n1354\n01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,970\nthat's the way you kind\nof force that along.\n\n1355\n01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,490\nSafe Boot's a pretty handy tool to use.\n\n1356\n01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:42,490\nBut once we've eliminated all\nof our issues, that's it.\n\n1357\n01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:43,540\nWe're good to go.\n\n1358\n01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:48,620\nI need to reboot my computer cuz I'm still\nin Safe Boot mode, but other than that,\n\n1359\n01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:51,810\nwe're up, we're operational, and we got\na chance to see a lot of the tools and\n\n1360\n01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:54,140\ntroubleshooting techniques\nthat are available for\n\n1361\n01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,720\nwhen we have a system that's\nnot performing right.\n\n1362\n01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:59,900\nAll right, well, that's about all I've\ngot for the system management and\n\n1363\n01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:00,975\nsystem troubleshooting piece.\n\n1364\n01:08:00,975 --> 01:08:03,775\nThis is a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap it up.\n\n1365\n01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:08,675\nThis is our final episode, so\nif you have any questions,\n\n1366\n01:08:08,675 --> 01:08:10,595\nwell you won't be able to jump\nin on the live one this time.\n\n1367\n01:08:10,595 --> 01:08:15,585\nNormally you'd go to itprotv/live and type\nright in that chat box all you want, but\n\n1368\n01:08:15,585 --> 01:08:17,125\nsince this is the final
