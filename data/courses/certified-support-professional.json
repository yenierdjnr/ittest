Certified\nSupport Professional or ACSP.\n\n4\n00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,656\nThe ACSP certification has been around for\nquite awhile with Apple and\n\n5\n00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:17,622\nit's designed for\n\n6\n00:00:17,622 --> 00:00:22,320\ntechnicians that are working in business\nenvironments where you're supporting.\n\n7\n00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,950\nApple computers, right, be they laptops,\nor desktops mostly, but\n\n8\n00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,520\na little bit of mobile, iPad,\niPhone type environments, but for\n\n9\n00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,490\nthe most part we're focusing on\nthe Mac OS ten side of things,\n\n10\n00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,130\nright, that operating system that we\nstill run on laptops and desktops.\n\n11\n00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,640\nACSP is not really designed for\na home user, right,\n\n12\n00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,180\njust a person who's got a single Mac or\ncouple Mac's home and that's it.\n\n13\n00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,790\nWe're really talking about businesses.\n\n14\n00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,820\nWhat do businesses go through\nwhen they deploy Macs, right?\n\n15\n00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,100\nAnd it kind of boils down\nto two different things.\n\n16\n00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,370\nOne is just supporting the native\nenvironment inside of Mac OS ten and\n\n17\n00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,640\nthen the other side is getting it to\ninteract with non-Apple operating systems.\n\n18\n00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,520\nIf you've got Linux systems or\n\n19\n00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,942\nMicrosoft Windows system, you gotta\nget the two to talk to each other.\n\n20\n00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:11,790\nThe ACSP is a nice certification\nthat covers a lot of that.\n\n21\n00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,210\nFrom basic installation which is where\nwe're gonna start, all the way up\n\n22\n00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,050\nto more advanced things like security and\nenforcing policy across your network.\n\n23\n00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,530\nIt's a really cool certification,\ncovers really practical skills.\n\n24\n00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,110\nAll too often we see technical\ncertification that are out there that\n\n25\n00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,740\ncover things that are Esoteric, or\n\n26\n00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,070\nthings that you aren't going to\nimplement in real life land very much.\n\n27\n00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,220\nBut this one, the ACSP, covers real\nworld activities that you can expect to\n\n28\n00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,640\nperform if you're supporting\nApple devices in your network.\n\n29\n00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,938\nThe exam itself is pretty straightforward.\n\n30\n00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,750\nWhat we're gonna be doing\nin this IT Pro TV series,\n\n31\n00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:52,410\nis covering all of the exam objectives\nthat are covered on the actual ACSP exam.\n\n32\n00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,310\nNow before I jump into those objectives,\nlet's talk a little bit about that exam.\n\n33\n00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,000\nUnlike the entry level\nApple certifications,\n\n34\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,050\nlike the Apple Certified Associate or\nACA, those certifications.\n\n35\n00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,350\nThose, you could take those exams at\na Pearsonvue center anywhere you wanted.\n\n36\n00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,220\nYou could actually take\nthem from your desktop.\n\n37\n00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,820\nYou can just go online and take the exam.\n\n38\n00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,610\nFor this one.\n\n39\n00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,010\nFor ACSP, you have to take it at\nan Apple-authorized training center,\n\n40\n00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,290\nan AATC, all right?\n\n41\n00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,790\nYou've gotta locate an AATC near you.\n\n42\n00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,855\nNow, most of the AATCs do run the course.\n\n43\n00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:26,435\nCourse for this certification.\n\n44\n00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:30,345\nThe official course, if you wanna take it,\nis the Yosemite 101 course.\n\n45\n00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:32,674\nBefore that it was the Mavericks 101.\n\n46\n00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:35,435\nThey always name it after\nthe OS it's based on.\n\n47\n00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:39,387\nIt's a great course, it takes usually\nfive days, and you take it in the AATC.\n\n48\n00:02:39,387 --> 00:02:43,705\nWe're gonna cover the same exact content\nhere, the advantage being you can do it at\n\n49\n00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,000\nyour own pace, and get ready for\nthe exam the same way.\n\n50\n00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,140\nBut either way, whether you do the\nofficial course or you watch our shows,\n\n51\n00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,650\nif you wanna get the certification,\nyou've got to take the test at an AATC,\n\n52\n00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,190\nwe don't have any way to\nadminister that to you guys.\n\n53\n00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,830\nYou've got to locate one that's near you,\nif you're like me, the nearest one is\n\n54\n00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,730\nabout two hours away, so I've got\nto hop in the car and drive a bit.\n\n55\n00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,040\nBut you go down there and\nyou can take the exam.\n\n56\n00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,730\nThe exam is a multiple place exam,\nfor the most part.\n\n57\n00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,250\nThere are some drag and drop and\nsome what are called hot spot questions,\n\n58\n00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,980\nwhere they show you a picture and\nyou have to click on an area.\n\n59\n00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,330\nClick on the icon that will take you to a\nutility that can perform this action, and\n\n60\n00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,440\nyou gotta click on the right icon.\n\n61\n00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,060\nThat kind of thing.\n\n62\n00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,440\nDrag and drop will be,\nhere's a list of events,\n\n63\n00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,490\ndrag them and put them in the right order.\n\n64\n00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,780\nIt's pretty straightforward questions,\nno real trick questions, or anything.\n\n65\n00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,680\nYou know what you need to do.\n\n66\n00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,870\nYou answer the question.\n\n67\n00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,170\nAnd you move on.\n\n68\n00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,810\nIt is a big exam.\n\n69\n00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,500\nIt's 80 questions or around 80 questions.\n\n70\n00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,800\nAnd you get two hours to do it in, so\nthat's about a minute and a half per\n\n71\n00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,530\nquestion, which is a pretty decent amount\nof time, if you know what you're doing.\n\n72\n00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,840\nIf you know the content, you won't have\nany problem finishing in time, but\n\n73\n00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,900\nif you have to deliberate on a lot of the\nquestions, you'll run out of time fast and\n\n74\n00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,890\nthat's unfortunate because any question\nyou don't get to is marked wrong, right?\n\n75\n00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,350\nYou don't get credit for those questions.\n\n76\n00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,500\nAll right, as far as taking the exam.\n\n77\n00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,580\nFinding your local AATC,\nthat's a big part of it.\n\n78\n00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,140\nAnd you can go to Apple's website and\n\n79\n00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,320\nthey have where you can\npull that information up.\n\n80\n00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,720\nIn fact, if you haven't been\nto Apple's website yet,\n\n81\n00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,930\nthat's a great place to start\nlearning about this certification.\n\n82\n00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,233\nYou can go to\ntraining.Apple.com/certification,\n\n83\n00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:21,070\nall right?\n\n84\n00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,220\nThat'll take you to the certification\npage, and you'll find in there where\n\n85\n00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,260\nthey've got certifications for creative\nprofessionals like graphics design.\n\n86\n00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,526\nAnd IT Professionals and,\nthey've got the Maverick 10.9 and\n\n87\n00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:36,040\nthe Yosemite 10.10 certifications up now.\n\n88\n00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,800\nThe Yosemite stuff at the time of\nthis taping is not all done yet.\n\n89\n00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,940\nThey're still in the works of creating it.\n\n90\n00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,300\nBut as soon as it's all done,\n\n91\n00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,910\nthey'll phase out the 10.9 certifications\nand you'll see that go away.\n\n92\n00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,870\nIf you go to the webpage and you don't\nsee 10.9 don't don't be surprised.\n\n93\n00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,510\nNow, when we go into 10.10, you'll\nsee a few of the certifications that\n\n94\n00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,910\nare available, and\nthey're only listing three.\n\n95\n00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,890\nThere's actually four.\n\n96\n00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,370\nThe fourth one's not done as of today.\n\n97\n00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,980\nThere's the Apple Certified Associate for\nMac Management Basics, which is for\n\n98\n00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,260\njust the basic administration\nof an Apple device.\n\n99\n00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,370\nThat exam is really straightforward, and\n\n100\n00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,530\nif you're just getting started with this,\nthat's really where you should start.\n\n101\n00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,470\nHere at IT Pro TV, we've already taped the\nseries from Mac Management Basics, we did\n\n102\n00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:25,030\nit for 10.9, but there's no significant\nchanges to that exam from 10.9 to 10.10.\n\n103\n00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,690\nIf you study the 10.9 material, you can\ntake either the 10.9 or the 10.10 exam and\n\n104\n00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,000\nyou'll do just fine.\n\n105\n00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,720\nIt's an inexpensive exam,\nit's $65 to take it.\n\n106\n00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,930\nAnd you can take it.\n\n107\n00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,680\nFrom your own desk you don't\nhave to travel anywhere, so\n\n108\n00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,410\nif your just getting started with Apple\nthat's really where you should start,\n\n109\n00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,210\nall right, the Apple Certified Associate\nfor Mac integration,\n\n110\n00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,140\nthat's getting your Macs to work\ntogether with Windows machines.\n\n111\n00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,010\nThere's a lot of Microsoft Windows\nmachines out there in\n\n112\n00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,550\nbusiness environments.\n\n113\n00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,290\nYou need to get them to\ntalk to each other and\n\n114\n00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,410\nexchange information and that's all that\nwhat that certification is all about.\n\n115\n00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,970\nIt covers some really great stuff.\n\n116\n00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,490\nAgain, we've already taped that series.\n\n117\n00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,080\nWe did it under 10.9,\n\n118\n00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,240\nbut no significant changes, there's a few\nlittle things that have been added.\n\n119\n00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,230\nWe're actually going to record some extra\nvideos to correct for those, but for\n\n120\n00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:16,780\nthe most part it's the same, next is the\nApple Certified Support Professional and\n\n121\n00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,480\nthat's this series that you're\nabout to watch, all right.\n\n122\n00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,710\nThat's the first of the upper\nlevel certifications.\n\n123\n00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,230\nThese are where things start to\nget a lot harder, all right.\n\n124\n00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,080\nThese first two exams,\nthey're pretty easy.\n\n125\n00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,830\nMost people should be able to study and\npass those exams in about a week really.\n\n126\n00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,960\nIf you watch the series and\nhit the book, and\n\n127\n00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,380\nthe book is free you can\ndownload it right from.\n\n128\n00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:37,920\nTheir website.\n\n129\n00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,640\nThat's the book for\nthose guys right there.\n\n130\n00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,530\nYou can download it, study, it should take\nyou a week, maybe two weeks to get ready,\n\n131\n00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,880\nget those certifications and\nhave them on your resume.\n\n132\n00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,530\nBut for\nthe the ASCP it's a lot more material.\n\n133\n00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,980\nIt's a big exam.\n\n134\n00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,630\nIt's a ton of information.\n\n135\n00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,190\nAnd this one's gonna require\na lot more work, all right?\n\n136\n00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,260\nIf you're just getting started,\nstart with these two guys here,.\n\n137\n00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,300\nThere's a lot of overlap.\n\n138\n00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,660\nThe things that you learn here,\nyou'll see again, is ACSP, so\n\n139\n00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,030\nhaving that under your belt, already\nhaving that knowledge is pretty handy.\n\n140\n00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,260\nNow, there's another\nlevel up above this one.\n\n141\n00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,340\nThe ACTC, that's not showing up here.\n\n142\n00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,260\nThat's an Apple Certified\nTechnical Coordinator.\n\n143\n00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,160\nAnd the only reason it's not showing\nup is the 10.10 version is not out yet.\n\n144\n00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,070\nIf I go back to the 10.9 page,\nyou'll see the ACTC right there.\n\n145\n00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,660\nAll right?\n\n146\n00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,790\nI'm gonna use this page for a minute just\nto kind of show you guys how this works,\n\n147\n00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:29,940\nbut basically,\nthe ACSP is where you start, all right.\n\n148\n00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,100\nThe earlier exams, the ACA's,\nthose are not prerequisites.\n\n149\n00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,950\nYou don't have to do those, if you\ndon't wanna do the ACA's, fine, don't.\n\n150\n00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,450\nJust skip right past them.\n\n151\n00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,640\nIf you already have that knowledge and\nyou're ready to move up to the next level,\n\n152\n00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,770\nthen you don't have to bother with it,\nI encourage people to do it but,\n\n153\n00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,520\nit's not a requirement.\n\n154\n00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,880\nThen, the ACSP, that's that first step for\nthe higher level certification.\n\n155\n00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,430\nIt's one show or this series that\nwe're about to do and one exam.\n\n156\n00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,885\nThe exam is the OS 10 or OS X Support,\nthe Essentials 10.10 exam.\n\n157\n00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:03,856\nIt says, 10.9.\n\n158\n00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:05,000\nAnd, it tells you right there.\n\n159\n00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,130\nAvailable only at Apple-authorized\ntraining centers.\n\n160\n00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,040\nAnd if you click on that link,\n\n161\n00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,740\nit will take you where you\ncan find a one near you.\n\n162\n00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,620\nNow they do have the official\nMavericks 101 course, but\n\n163\n00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,670\nthis is what I wanted to point you guys to\nright here, the Exam Preparation Guide.\n\n164\n00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:22,700\nThe Exam Prep Guide has a lot of\ninformation to get you ready for the exam.\n\n165\n00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,542\nAnd the main thing is let me go back to\n10.10 here we go the main thing is when we\n\n166\n00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:31,958\ngo to that Exam Prep Guide, it's a PDF,\nyour machine will download it and\n\n167\n00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,870\nyou'll pull it up here.\n\n168\n00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,000\nIt'll tell you what to expect on the exam.\n\n169\n00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,790\nA lot of the stuff that I've\nbeen saying right here,\n\n170\n00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,090\nthat you've got the entry-level certs,\nand the higher-level certs.\n\n171\n00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,480\nIt'll tell you in here how many\nquestions the exam is, 80 questions,\n\n172\n00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,680\nyou've got to score a 73% to pass.\n\n173\n00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,010\nGeneral information that you'll\nwant to know to be prepared.\n\n174\n00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,370\nBut the most important\npart is right down here.\n\n175\n00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,040\nWhere it goes into the exam objectives.\n\n176\n00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,370\nThe exam, is broken up across\neight different knowledge areas.\n\n177\n00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,350\nPart one is installation and\nconfiguration.\n\n178\n00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,910\nWhat does it take just\nto install Yosemite, and\n\n179\n00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,990\ndo a basic configuration to get it up and\noperational?\n\n180\n00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,470\nThat's the first part.\n\n181\n00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,340\nAnd then they list all\nthe things you should know.\n\n182\n00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,460\nRead through these.\n\n183\n00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,130\nDo you already know all of these?\n\n184\n00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,400\nIf you already know how to\ndo all of these things,\n\n185\n00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,530\nthen you can skip past this section and\ngo to the next one.\n\n186\n00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,860\nOr if you need a refresher,\nif you don't know some of these things,\n\n187\n00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,840\nthen go ahead and watch it.\n\n188\n00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,210\nWatch that show or a couple of shows and\n\n189\n00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,070\nwe'll cover that content\nas we move through it.\n\n190\n00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,420\nAfter that it starts to\nmove into other areas.\n\n191\n00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,470\nLike, if I can scroll down and find it.\n\n192\n00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,680\nThey have like some review and\npractice questions too,\n\n193\n00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,880\nwhich is kind of nice if\nyou're getting ready.\n\n194\n00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,170\nPart two is user accounts.\n\n195\n00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,940\nWe start breaking down the different\ntypes of user accounts in Mac OS,\n\n196\n00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,520\nand how to create them,\nhow to disable them.\n\n197\n00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,990\nAnd all the various things that\nare involved in managing that.\n\n198\n00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,770\nNow, when we talk about managing user\naccounts, they might be local accounts,\n\n199\n00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,400\non your individual machine, but\n\n200\n00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,280\nthey might also be network accounts\non a machine that running OSX server.\n\n201\n00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,650\nThere's different types of accounts\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n202\n00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,460\nAnd then there's also some underlying,\n\n203\n00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,270\nhidden accounts like\nthe root user account.\n\n204\n00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,650\nWe talk about those,\nit's pretty good stuff, right?\n\n205\n00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,840\nThings that you will\nencounter in real life.\n\n206\n00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,350\nAnd so it breaks all those down.\n\n207\n00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,290\nAnd you start to see that information,\nnow for the ACSP,\n\n208\n00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,010\nyou don't see a lot of server items right?\n\n209\n00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,290\nWe'll mention that yeah there's user\naccounts if you have OSX server.\n\n210\n00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,125\nBut we're gonna work with the local.\n\n211\n00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,335\nCouple of accounts here in ACSP.\n\n212\n00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:29,465\nFor those of you moving to the next level,\nthe Apple Certified Technical Coordinator,\n\n213\n00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:32,225\nthat's where the server\ninformation comes in.\n\n214\n00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:37,243\nAnd let me go back to that page\nthat was the, the 10.9 page.\n\n215\n00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:41,675\nI'm just gonna jump back to that one to\nshow you guys how these stack together.\n\n216\n00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:45,400\nThe ACA, that was not a prerequisite.\n\n217\n00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,860\nForgetting the ACSP.\n\n218\n00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,800\nYou don't have to do the ACA's,\nyou can skip past them, and do the ACSP.\n\n219\n00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,500\nBut if you want your\nApple Certified Technical Coordinator,\n\n220\n00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,350\nif you want to get the ACTC,\nyou have to get the ACSP first.\n\n221\n00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,580\nThe ACSP is that first step on\nthat advanced level certification.\n\n222\n00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,760\nYou've got to do the ACSP first.\n\n223\n00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,450\nOnce you've passed it,\nthen you do the ACTC.\n\n224\n00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,840\nAnd when you've passed both,\n\n225\n00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,330\nthat's when you're awarded\nthe Apple Certified Technical Coordinator.\n\n226\n00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,330\nAnd if you look at the two courses,\nyou've got this Mavericks 101.\n\n227\n00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,022\nAnd you've got the Mavericks 201.\n\n228\n00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:22,140\nThe 101 is what we're gonna\nbe covering here in ACSP.\n\n229\n00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,396\nThat's the.\nThe OSX Support Essentials, and\n\n230\n00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:26,925\nwe're doing 10.10, all right.\n\n231\n00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:31,685\nThe other one is OSX Server Essentials\n10.10, all right.\n\n232\n00:11:31,685 --> 00:11:33,585\nThat's why we move the server stuff off.\n\n233\n00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:37,015\nIf you watch the ACSP show, and you're\nlike, man, that was a good show, but Don,\n\n234\n00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:39,265\nyou didn't cover any server stuff,\nare you scared?\n\n235\n00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,215\nWell, no, not scared, I promise.\n\n236\n00:11:41,215 --> 00:11:44,825\nWell, maybe a little, but we moved it off\nto another show, right, cuz it's covered\n\n237\n00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:48,700\nin that OSX server essentials, so\nthat's what we're gonna tackle.\n\n238\n00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,970\nThe two combined, it's two exams.\n\n239\n00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,940\nYou pass them both and you get your ACTC.\n\n240\n00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,200\nThat's usually the certification\nthat people are reaching out for\n\n241\n00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,650\nACST looks good on your resume,\nit'll help you get in and get that job.\n\n242\n00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,160\nACTC is when you really show that\nyou have expert level knowledge\n\n243\n00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,150\nof implementing max in\na business environment.\n\n244\n00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,200\nIn a home environment,\nyou're not gonna have a server, but\n\n245\n00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,400\nin a business environment, you will and\nthat server knowledge is really important\n\n246\n00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,470\nand so that ACTC is a great\ngoal to reach out for, right?\n\n247\n00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,590\nThat's not what we're covering in\nthis show, we're doing ACSP, so\n\n248\n00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,820\nlet's talk a little bit about some of\nthe things that were covered in there.\n\n249\n00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,370\nWe are gonna talk about installation and\nconfiguration, right?\n\n250\n00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,570\nWe already saw that.\n\n251\n00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,760\nWe are going to talk about,\nuser accounts, and the user accounts\n\n252\n00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,510\nthat are on the system, the pre-built ones\nas well as ones that we make ourselves.\n\n253\n00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,500\nWe are gonna look at the file system,\nthat mac OS uses.\n\n254\n00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,370\nAs far as the Apple\nsupported ones like HFS,\n\n255\n00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,600\nas well as third party ones like NTFS, and\nCDFS, and we'll get a chance to see those.\n\n256\n00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,550\nWe're gonna take a look\nat data management.\n\n257\n00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,490\nAs far as things that we can do with the\ninformation we store on our hard drives.\n\n258\n00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,450\nYosemite introduced\nsome really cool stuff.\n\n259\n00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,970\nLike universal tagging.\n\n260\n00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,890\nAnd if you haven't used that yet\nit's really cool.\n\n261\n00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,160\nWe'll get a chance to see some of those.\n\n262\n00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,590\nWe're gonna talk about applications and\nprocesses.\n\n263\n00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,190\nHow do we install applications and\nkeep them updated.\n\n264\n00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,770\nAnd how do we control the applications?\n\n265\n00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,240\nIf we have one start to run wild and\n\n266\n00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,050\neat up all of our CPU,\nhow do we even know that happens?\n\n267\n00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,640\nWe'll get a chance to see that and\nhow to with them.\n\n268\n00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,840\nWe're gonna do network configuration.\n\n269\n00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,500\nIn this day and\n\n270\n00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,900\nage it's a rare computer that isn't\nat least connected to the Internet.\n\n271\n00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,400\nBut more importantly, I wanna\nconnect your computers together, so\n\n272\n00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,990\nthey can exchange information.\n\n273\n00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,770\nWe'll get a chance to\nsee that in networking.\n\n274\n00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,060\nWe'll also see system management.\n\n275\n00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,290\nSystem management ranges from\nkeeping our systems up to date,\n\n276\n00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,500\nas well as controlling\ntheir configuration.\n\n277\n00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,670\nWe'll get e few examples there to see how\nto keep our systems nice and clean and\n\n278\n00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,210\noperating smoothly.\n\n279\n00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,990\nThen we wrap up the series\ntalking about security, and\n\n280\n00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,240\nit's actually a part of system management.\n\n281\n00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,580\nWe'll see the firewall, the gatekeeper,\n\n282\n00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,050\nsome of the other applications\nthat Apple builds in.\n\n283\n00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,650\nTo keep your computer safe, so that you\ndon't have to worry about viruses and\n\n284\n00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,280\nall that mess, but the other guys do.\n\n285\n00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,880\nThat's the general range of topics\nthat we're gonna be covering.\n\n286\n00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,675\nRemember that ASCP is focused on Yosemite\nitself, on the operating system.\n\n287\n00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:09,425\nVersus, the ACTC which moves\nto the server side and\n\n288\n00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:13,615\nnow starts to get a little more different,\nblended services across the network.\n\n289\n00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:17,345\nTwo kind of different areas\nthat we're gonna jump into.\n\n290\n00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:20,992\nWell all of that sounds excited and\ninteresting to you,\n\n291\n00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:26,280\nthen you're in the right place, stay\ntuned, our ACSP series is starting next.\n\n292\n00:14:26,280 -->
