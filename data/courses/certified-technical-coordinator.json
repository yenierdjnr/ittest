          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,144\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,144 --> 00:00:08,040\nIn this segment,\n\n3\n00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,569\nwe're gonna take a look at\nthe Apple Certified Technical Coordinator\n\n4\n00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:13,060\ncertification.\n\n5\n00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,820\nThe ACTC is the highest level\ncertification from Apple for\n\n6\n00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,820\nIT professionals.\n\n7\n00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,220\nNow, who is an IT professional?\n\n8\n00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,980\nWell, these are people that work in\nbusinesses, enterprises, government\n\n9\n00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,670\norganizations schools that are responsible\nfor supporting Apple computers.\n\n10\n00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,920\nRight.\nAnd this spans from MacBooks to Mac Pros\n\n11\n00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,040\nto iPads to iPhones, all the various\nApple devices that are out there.\n\n12\n00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,650\nMost of them are designed for\nconsumer level use.\n\n13\n00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,240\nRight.\nJust regular home users that have\n\n14\n00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,480\na single device.\n\n15\n00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,380\nBut when we deploy them in a corporate\nworld or an educational world,\n\n16\n00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,980\nwhere you might have hundreds,\nthousands, tens of thousands at Mac.\n\n17\n00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,210\nThere's actually some really cool\nadministrative software available\n\n18\n00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,330\nto help do that, to help provide a unified\nenvironment even though we have a large\n\n19\n00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,680\nquantity of these devices, and\nthat's what the ACTC is all about.\n\n20\n00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,500\nNow, if you've landed here,\nyou've probably already taken the ACSP,\n\n21\n00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,250\nthe Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n22\n00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,540\nIf you haven't, the ACSP is the first\nstep along the way of getting your ACTC,\n\n23\n00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,696\nthe Apple Certified Technical Coordinator.\n\n24\n00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:16,850\nIf you're gonna be working\nas a help desk technician,\n\n25\n00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,030\nif you're gonna be helping\npeople work with their Macs,\n\n26\n00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,840\nthat's what the ACSP is designed for,\nthe Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n27\n00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,360\nBut if you're gonna be running\na larger organization,\n\n28\n00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,840\nif you're gonna be the big picture person,\nthe person that says.\n\n29\n00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,280\nI've got hundreds of thousands of Macs.\n\n30\n00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,040\nHow do I get them all talking together?\n\n31\n00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,750\nHow do I get them able to locate\neach other across multiple networks?\n\n32\n00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,820\nHow do we provide that infrastructure?\n\n33\n00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,800\nThat's what the ACTC is for.\n\n34\n00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,300\nAll right.\n\n35\n00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,870\nNow where it gets confusing,\nis kind of how the exams are structured.\n\n36\n00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,800\nIf you want to get the Apple Certified\nTechnical Coordinator certification,\n\n37\n00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,080\nthere's actually two exams\nthat you have to take.\n\n38\n00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,790\nThere's the exam for the ACSP, for the\nApple Certified Sport Professional, and\n\n39\n00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,120\nthere's a separate one that's designed for\nserver.\n\n40\n00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,950\nLet me show you on Apple's website, so\n\n41\n00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,650\nwe can kind of make this\nas clear as possible.\n\n42\n00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,160\nApple's website is\ntraining.apple.com/certification,\n\n43\n00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,090\nand that's where they have all\ntheir certifications laid out.\n\n44\n00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,140\nThey've got certifications for\n\n45\n00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,110\nIT professionals,\nas well as creative professionals right.\n\n46\n00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,860\nThe design and graphics people.\n\n47\n00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,710\nFor us, we're dealing with\nthe IT professionals side.\n\n48\n00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,660\nAnd if you take a look,\nthey've got certifications for\n\n49\n00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,470\nthe different versions of\nMac OS that have come out.\n\n50\n00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:32,430\nSo we see 10.9 Mavericks and\n10.10 Yosemite, we're doing 10.10.\n\n51\n00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,050\nAnd if you jump in there,\nthey lay out the certifications.\n\n52\n00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,100\nNow there's the entry level\nApple Certified Associate, or\n\n53\n00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,740\nACA certifications.\n\n54\n00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,920\nThat's for people just getting started.\n\n55\n00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,850\nAnd they're really good certifications.\n\n56\n00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,640\nThe courses are fairly short.\n\n57\n00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,350\nThe exam fee is really low.\n\n58\n00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,690\nYou can take it right from\nthe comfort of your own home.\n\n59\n00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,160\nReally straightforward\ncertification to get.\n\n60\n00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,120\nIf you don't have any Apple certifications\nat all, that's really the place to start.\n\n61\n00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,560\nBut, it's not required.\n\n62\n00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,190\nIf you've been working with Macs for\nyears, you can skip right past the ACA and\n\n63\n00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,700\njump right up to the ACTC if you want,\nright.\n\n64\n00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,300\nNow, most people start with the ACSP,\nthe Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n65\n00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,988\nThere's one exam that goes along with it,\nand that exam is called the OS 10 or OS X.\n\n66\n00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,040\nSupport Essentials 10.10 exam.\n\n67\n00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,110\nAll right, so\nthat's the first exam that we take.\n\n68\n00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,130\nIf you want your ACTC,\nyou need to take a second exam.\n\n69\n00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,750\nYou've got the Support Essentials exam and\n\n70\n00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,600\nthen you've also go\nthe OS X Server Essentials exam.\n\n71\n00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,290\nSupport Essentials,\nthat focuses on workstations,\n\n72\n00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,610\ndesktops, laptops how we keep them up and\nrunning and healthy.\n\n73\n00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,050\nBut the server essentials that\ndives into the server app and\n\n74\n00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,010\na lot of the extra infrastructure that\na regular end user is never gonna see or\n\n75\n00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,350\nknow about but\nthey're gonna use it all the time.\n\n76\n00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,980\nThey don't just realize it,\nit's all transparent in the background.\n\n77\n00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,030\nSo that's the server essentials one,\nnow you can take these out of order,\n\n78\n00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,200\nif you want.\n\n79\n00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,350\nIf you do the server essentials first,\nyou actually do get awarded the ACSP.\n\n80\n00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,820\nThey don't show that on the site,\nbut you do.\n\n81\n00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,640\nIf you take just the server essentials,\nyou will take the ACSP, but\n\n82\n00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,250\nyou still don't get the ACTC\nuntil you pass both of them.\n\n83\n00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,440\nRight, now if you're just getting started,\n\n84\n00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,580\nyou should definitely\ncheck out our ACSP show.\n\n85\n00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,860\nWe've already filmed all the material for\nthat 10.10 Yosemite.\n\n86\n00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,280\nYou can jump in there, watch it,\nget that certification.\n\n87\n00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,892\nThat's where you start.\n\n88\n00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:27,200\nAll right.\n\n89\n00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,330\nBut if you just wanna learn about\nserver or if you've already pass ACSP,\n\n90\n00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,670\nthen it's time to move into this one\ninto the OS 10 server essentials course.\n\n91\n00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,580\nAnd here's where we start to\nlearn the advance infrastructure.\n\n92\n00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,320\nWhen you've passed that exam,\n\n93\n00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,720\nyou're now awarded the Apple Certified\nTechnical Coordinator certification.\n\n94\n00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,940\nThere is an upgrade path,\nthat's what they're showing here,\n\n95\n00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,500\nthe re-certification exam.\n\n96\n00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,412\nIf you were certified under\n10.9 Mavericks, or 10.8, or\n\n97\n00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:56,920\nanything earlier, you can just\ntake the re-certification exam.\n\n98\n00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,660\nIt covers material from both of the other\nexams, though, so it's the same content.\n\n99\n00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,960\nYou still have to know\nthe same information, but\n\n100\n00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,660\nit's just all grouped\ntogether right there.\n\n101\n00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,950\nAll right, now,\nlet's talk a little bit about the exam.\n\n102\n00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,980\nOn Apple's website they had these\nexam preparation guides and\n\n103\n00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,850\nthey are great to use to\nstructure your studying.\n\n104\n00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,200\nThey're a great way to know\nwhat to expect on the exam.\n\n105\n00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,405\nAnd to make sure that you've learned all\nthe material that you need to learn,\n\n106\n00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,190\nright.\n\n107\n00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,580\nUse it as a checklist.\n\n108\n00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,340\nI'm gonna pull up the one for\nServer Essentials here.\n\n109\n00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,026\nI'll just go that exam\npreparation guide and\n\n110\n00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:31,072\nwe'll pull that one up We\nwill go in English today.\n\n111\n00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:33,453\nHere we go.\n\n112\n00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:34,869\nAnd in this document,\n\n113\n00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:38,760\nit will have everything you\nneed to know about the exam.\n\n114\n00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,235\nAnd they lay it out in a pretty\nstraightforward process.\n\n115\n00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:42,760\nRight.\nThey explain the certifications,\n\n116\n00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,210\nwhat I was just talking about a moment\nago, but here's the really cool part.\n\n117\n00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,000\nHere's where they tell you\nabout the exam itself.\n\n118\n00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,550\nAll right.\n\n119\n00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,800\nSo what do we need to know?\n\n120\n00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,907\nWell, the exam number is 9L0-525.\n\n121\n00:05:53,907 --> 00:05:56,140\nWe need to know that for\nwhen we schedule the exam.\n\n122\n00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,290\nWhen you're ready to sign up for\nit, you go to Apple's web site and\n\n123\n00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,710\nyou sign up to take that exam.\n\n124\n00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,690\nNow, the exam is proctored through\nApple Authorized Training Centers, AATCs.\n\n125\n00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,550\nAnd you can go to Apple's website and\ndo a search.\n\n126\n00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,670\nI'll put a link in the notes for this.\n\n127\n00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,400\nThat you can click on to go and\nfind the nearest testing center to you.\n\n128\n00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,120\nSometimes they're right in\nthe same city as you, and\n\n129\n00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,630\nthat works out really convenient.\n\n130\n00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,400\nSometimes you're like me.\n\n131\n00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,510\nI have to drive two hours away to get\nto the nearest AATC to take exams or\n\n132\n00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,990\nto take official courses.\n\n133\n00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,420\nSo you can jump over and do that.\n\n134\n00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,080\nBut you can find those\nlisted right on the website.\n\n135\n00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,430\nThe exam is a computer based exam.\n\n136\n00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,060\nIt's 80 questions long.\n\n137\n00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,740\nAnd you get two hours, all right.\n\n138\n00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,170\nSo two hours for\neighty questions really not that bad.\n\n139\n00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,840\nYou get about a minute and\na half per questions.\n\n140\n00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,720\nA little bit more.\n\n141\n00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,990\nAnd you jump through and\nyou take care of it.\n\n142\n00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,520\nMost of the questions are multiple choice.\n\n143\n00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,980\nBut there are some drag and\ndrop and visual elements as well,\n\n144\n00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,640\nwhere they'll show you a screen\ncapture of the server app, and\n\n145\n00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,970\nthey'll say, where would you go in\nthis to perform a certain action?\n\n146\n00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,740\nAnd so you've gotta click.\n\n147\n00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,540\nThey have hotspots on the image.\n\n148\n00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,050\nSo, you get different\nquestions of that nature.\n\n149\n00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,370\nBut, most of them\nare just multiple choice.\n\n150\n00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,630\nBe aware that on Apple exams,\nyou do get partial credit for questions.\n\n151\n00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,700\nSo, if you get a question\nthat says something like\n\n152\n00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,140\nchoose three of the following that\nprovides such and such feature,\n\n153\n00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,450\nand they give you a list of 10 items.\n\n154\n00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,260\nWell, if you get two of the three right,\nyou actually do get partial credit.\n\n155\n00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,230\nSome of the other exam vendors\nout there like Microsoft,\n\n156\n00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,180\nthey don't do partial credit,\nbut Apple does.\n\n157\n00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,100\nSo make sure even if\nyou're not positive of\n\n158\n00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,410\nthe answer that you at least go ahead and\nfill it in.\n\n159\n00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,499\nBecause the parts that you do get right,\nyou will get credit on.\n\n160\n00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,820\nThere's a couple of other things,\nthere is a little confusion.\n\n161\n00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,840\nLet's see, did they say it here?\n\n162\n00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,240\nYeah.\nThere's a little confusion on this\n\n163\n00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,382\nline right here, that the exam includes\nfive unscored demographic questions.\n\n164\n00:07:42,382 --> 00:07:43,750\nAll right.\n\n165\n00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,330\nThere's some people out there that say,\nwell what that means is you actually get\n\n166\n00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,790\n80 questions and\nfive of them are unscored.\n\n167\n00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,050\nBut what really is is\nthere's 85 questions.\n\n168\n00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,190\nThere's a little five question survey\nat the very beginning that asks some\n\n169\n00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,180\ndemographics.\n\n170\n00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,480\nBasically how much experience you have.\n\n171\n00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,640\nHave you worked with Apple products?\n\n172\n00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,820\nHow did you study?\n\n173\n00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,320\nThings like that.\n\n174\n00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,600\nAnd those are unscored.\n\n175\n00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,400\nBut you will have 80 actual\nscored questions on the exam\n\n176\n00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,490\nspread across two hours.\n\n177\n00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:14,080\nNow the exam covers a wide range of\ntopics and [LAUGH] they lay it out\n\n178\n00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,670\nin just like painful detail right here\nacross 30 pages or something like that.\n\n179\n00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,290\nBut I'm gonna go up to the table of\ncontents, it's a little bit easier to take\n\n180\n00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,570\nin the exam content's divided\nup into seven areas alright.\n\n181\n00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,840\nIt starts out with configuring and\nmonitoring OS X server, right.\n\n182\n00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,730\nWe need the server app to\nturn our Mac into a server.\n\n183\n00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,640\nAnd it adds a lot of functionality\nthat technically was there already but\n\n184\n00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,620\nnow becomes visible on the graphical user\ninterface It's all hidden by default.\n\n185\n00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,660\nSo we can bring that out\nwith a server app, but\n\n186\n00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,760\nwe need to understand, how do we install\nit, how do we get it configured,\n\n187\n00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,390\nhow do we get it running, and\nhow do we keep it running.\n\n188\n00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,130\nAnd that's what that first section covers.\n\n189\n00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,120\nThis is the biggest section\nof the entire exam.\n\n190\n00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,050\nA lot of the exam content comes from\nright out of this very first part.\n\n191\n00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,620\nThen it divides the rest of the content\ninto more specific areas, right.\n\n192\n00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,450\nPart two is configuring accounts.\n\n193\n00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,090\nThese are local user accounts for\n\n194\n00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,280\na Mac as well as centralized user\naccounts in an open directory.\n\n195\n00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,659\nIf you've never worked with open\ndirectory, it's really cool software,\n\n196\n00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:14,715\nit's very powerful and\n\n197\n00:09:14,715 --> 00:09:18,063\ndefinitely something you'll want if\nyou have more than a handful of Macs.\n\n198\n00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:23,580\nThen we do managing devices\nwith configuration profiles.\n\n199\n00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,810\nIf you just have one Mac, you set\nthings up right there on the Mac and\n\n200\n00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,120\nyou just do it by hand.\n\n201\n00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,640\nBut if you have 1000 Macs,\nyou dont want to have to go and\n\n202\n00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,750\nconfigure every single one of\nthem it would take forever.\n\n203\n00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,720\nSo with configuration profiles we can\ncreate a standard configuration for\n\n204\n00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,450\nour Macs, and we can roll that out, either\nroll it out after the Macs are already out\n\n205\n00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,070\nthere or\nwe can build it into our deployment image.\n\n206\n00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,801\nSo that when we first install\nMac OS on the system it's already\n\n207\n00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:51,055\nconfigured the way that we want it,\nit already has the software we need and\n\n208\n00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:52,803\nit's ready to run right out of the box.\n\n209\n00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,311\nPart four is sharing files.\n\n210\n00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:57,425\nRight.\nHow do we exchange information between our\n\n211\n00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:59,547\nsystems and\nthat one's pretty straight forward,\n\n212\n00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:00,990\nnot a whole ton to deal with there.\n\n213\n00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,990\nPart five is deployment solutions.\n\n214\n00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,810\nI mentioned just a minute ago that we\ncould make images that already have Mac OS\n\n215\n00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,160\nset up the way we want it and roll it out\nonto the network, well how do you do that?\n\n216\n00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,260\nThat's what we'll cover\nin deployment solutions.\n\n217\n00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,500\nWe'll get a chance to see how\nto do scheduled network repairs,\n\n218\n00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,980\nhow to build an image and\ndeploy it over the network and\n\n219\n00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,830\ndo a lot of this stuff without\neven having a USB key or\n\n220\n00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,820\nbootable media you can do it right from\nthe network, really cool stuff there.\n\n221\n00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,690\nPart six is providing network services.\n\n222\n00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,500\nAnd this one's actually a collection\nof different technologies.\n\n223\n00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,230\nIn the server app,\nthere's a lot of functionality in there.\n\n224\n00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,120\nThings like automatic updates and\ncashing services, DNS.\n\n225\n00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,120\nAll of these various network services that\n\n226\n00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,230\ntaken individually aren't all that\npowerful but put together as a whole,\n\n227\n00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,870\nreally creates an amazing\nnetwork infrastructure.\n\n228\n00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,140\nAnd we'll take a look at that in part six.\n\n229\n00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,360\nAnd then the very end, part seven,\nis collaborative services.\n\n230\n00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,030\nWe're gonna take a look at email and\nchat, FaceTime.\n\n231\n00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,180\nSome of the different ways that we\ncommunicate between our users and\n\n232\n00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,750\nhow we deploy that in\na server environment.\n\n233\n00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,220\nHow we can keep a lot of that local\ninstead of relying on internet services.\n\n234\n00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,770\nSo if we're trying to maintain privacy and\nsecurity.\n\n235\n00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,270\nWe don't wanna use an internet service for\n\n236\n00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,350\nthat we'll get a chance to\nsee how to use the server.\n\n237\n00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,520\nSo really powerful stuff.\n\n238\n00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,860\nIf you attended the ACSP training if you\nwatched that whole series of shows you\n\n239\n00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,970\nmight have said by the end of it, man Don\nnever launched that server app at a single\n\n240\n00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,900\ntime, and\nthe reason is we do it right here.\n\n241\n00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,470\nAll this is based on the server\napp inside of Mac OS, and\n\n242\n00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,670\na little bit of Remote Desktop, we'll see\nhow Remote Desktop goes in there too.\n\n243\n00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,290\nBut most of it's done with the server app,\n\n244\n00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,920\nwe'll get a chance to see all\nthe stuff that it can do, really cool.\n\n245\n00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,820\nYour regular end user doesn't\nneed this information.\n\n246\n00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,320\nYour help desk professional typically\ndoesn't need this information, but\n\n247\n00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,870\nif you're one of the system engineers or\neven an information system manager or\n\n248\n00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,000\nsomebody like that.\n\n249\n00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,930\nYou're the big picture guy, you're trying\nto think of the infrastructure that's\n\n250\n00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,652\nneeded to support your Macs,\nthis is what you want to know.\n\n251\n00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:58,000\nAll right.\n\n252\n00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,540\nSo it is an advanced topic for\nprerequisites,\n\n253\n00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,720\nApple doesn't really have\nany prerequisites for this.\n\n254\n00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,465\nAnybody can walk right in off of\nthe street and take this exam.\n\n255\n00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:09,690\nRight.\nThey'll probably fail, but they can do it.\n\n256\n00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:15,630\nWhat Apple recommends is that at a minimum\nyou do the ACSP for desktop support first.\n\n257\n00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,500\nThe Apple Certified Support Professional.\n\n258\n00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,430\nYou go ahead and take that Support Basics\nexam and get that under your belt.\n\n259\n00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,710\nBecause you don't wanna be trying\nto fix a server problem and\n\n260\n00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,120\nhave it actually just turn out to\nbe a Mac OS problem under the hood.\n\n261\n00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,210\nAnd it could have been something\nthat was easily prevented,\n\n262\n00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,790\nhad you known that\nunderlying infrastructure.\n\n263\n00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,980\nAll right.\n\n264\n00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,790\nI think that's really about it.\n\n265\n00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,520\nLet me just check my outline here and\nmake sure I haven't missed anything crazy.\n\n266\n00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,590\nThe only thing I didn't mention.\n\n267\n00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,250\nIf you take the exam and you do not pass,\nit's not the end of the world,\n\n268\n00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,380\nyou can retake it.\n\n269\n00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,010\nBut there is a seven-day cool\ndown period in between attempts.\n\n270\n00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,030\nSo if you take the exam and\n\n271\n00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,980\ndon't pass, you'll have to wait at least\na week before you can take the exam again.\n\n272\n00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,390\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n273\n00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,900\nThe exam is not the most\nchallenging in the world, but\n\n274\n00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,832\nit's covering a lot of topics that\nare things we don't work with every day.\n\n275\n00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:07,870\nAll right.\nI've set up a number of\n\n276\n00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,980\nApple Open Directory Environments,\nbut I haven't done one this week.\n\n277\n00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,520\nI don't do one last week.\n\n278\n00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,990\nSo these are technologies and skills\nwe don't work with every single day.\n\n279\n00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,560\nIt's easy to forget that, so you need to\nmake sure you hit the books and you study,\n\n280\n00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,220\nthat you watch the episodes,\nyou learn the content.\n\n281\n00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,491\nAnd then you'll be ready for\nthat exam and it wont be a problem.\n\n282\n00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:26,100\nRight.\nSo\n\n283\n00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,360\nthat's basically what we\ndo in this series, right.\n\n284\n00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,640\nIn the ITProTV series for ACSP we're\ngonna break all that up into episodes.\n\n285\n00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,720\nWe're gonna walk through using\nall the different technologies,\n\n286\n00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,040\nwe'll get a chance to see it.\n\n287\n00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,120\nI'll post show notes with each episode, so\n\n288\n00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,170\nyou'll have some notes that\nare available to be able to refer to.\n\n289\n00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,110\nAnd use those in your studies,\nit makes it really handy.\n\n290\n00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,940\nAnd then, as in show on ITProTV, if you\nhave questions while you're studying,\n\n291\n00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,970\nyou always have that opportunity to ask.\n\n292\n00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,580\nIf you're watching live, on ITProTV/live,\nyou can use the live chat room right\n\n293\n00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,250\nthere, post your questions and\nwe'll answer you during the show.\n\n294\n00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,610\nBut we're only live for\n\n295\n00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,170\na little while with Apple before\nwe move onto the next show.\n\n296\n00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,180\nSo if you're watching this\nrecording down the road,\n\n297\n00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,200\nthis is me talking to the future.\n\n298\n00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,970\nSo if you're watching this in the future,\nuse our forums.\n\n299\n00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,350\nOn every ITVPro page, you'll see\na link at the top that says Q&A.\n\n300\n00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,170\nIt's our question and answer forum.\n\n301\n00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,660\nYou can post your questions there.\n\n302\n00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,370\nAnd we'll get you the answers you need so\nthat you know the content and that way,\n\n303\n00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,520\nwhen you go to take the exam,\n\n304\n00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,670\nyou're walking in there with answers\nin your head and not with questions.\n\n305\n00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,880\nThat's our goal,\nwe wanna make sure that you're successful.\n\n306\n00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,000\nAlso remember that this is not\nnecessarily the course for everybody.\n\n307\n00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,150\nIf this sounded like a little more than\nyou wanted to know, that's fine, right.\n\n308\n00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,400\nWe've got our other
