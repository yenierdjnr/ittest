So ultimately I wanted to build\nsomething that brought together\n\n9\n00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.530\nsome of these new elements, but\nmaybe some old elements that helped people\n\n10\n00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.250\nunderstand how does\neverything come together.\n\n11\n00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.250\nSo ultimately our goal is to build\na React application that simulates\n\n12\n00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.200\na chat application with rooms, and\nmessages, and users, but instead of\n\n13\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.930\nbuilding our own authentication back end\nor having a different hosting service.\n\n14\n00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.790\nI decided to go with Firebase,\nwhich is a product from Google\n\n15\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.680\nthat allows authentication, database,\nreal-time database actually.\n\n16\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.700\nIt will tell you when things have changed,\nand you can put those out to all of\n\n17\n00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.160\nthe current users as well as a hosting\nservice for your particular project.\n\n18\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.080\nSo it's kind of a backend as a service,\nas it will.\n\n19\n00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.260\nNow our ultimate goal is to take that\nchat application and slowly weave in\n\n20\n00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.900\nFirebase as we go along and this is a more\ntraditional one using Create React App\n\n21\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.680\njust building a straight one,\nno state management nothing like that.\n\n22\n00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.035\nAnd then coming back deploying to Firebase\nand seeing how it all comes to fruition.\n\n23\n00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:24.185\n&gt;&gt; Now who's this show targeted towards?\n\n24\n00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:27.495\n&gt;&gt; So this show is someone who has\ndefinitely had at least a little bit of\n\n25\n00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:28.435\ninteraction with React.\n\n26\n00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:31.775\nYou don't have to be an expert, but you\nshould know a fair amount of JavaScript,\n\n27\n00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:33.985\nyou need to know about node and MPM.\n\n28\n00:01:33.985 --> 00:01:36.475\nYou should already have\na text editor set up.\n\n29\n00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:40.418\nThis is someone who has dabbled in web\ndevelopment, but wants to know a little\n\n30\n00:01:40.418 --> 00:01:44.555\nmore about these advanced features that\ncome along with the Firebase platform.\n\n31\n00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:48.771\nAnd they just really wanna level up so\nif you're brand new to HTML, CSS and\n\n32\n00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:53.599\nJavaScript there maybe a fair amount of\nconcepts where you're like I'm just having\n\n33\n00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:54.220\ntrouble.\n\n34\n00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.605\nSo definitely go check out some other\nthings come back after that and\n\n35\n00:01:58.605 --> 00:02:00.595\nhopefully you'll see how\nall of this comes together.\n\n36\n00:02:00.595 --> 00:02:03.655\n&gt;&gt; Now Justin is there\na certification available for this.\n\n37\n00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:06.445\n&gt;&gt; So, these course are typically\nnot certification driven.\n\n38\n00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:08.055\nThese are more of a I want to power up.\n\n39\n00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:08.955\nI want to learn more.\n\n40\n00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:10.346\nI want to see how these,\n\n41\n00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:14.670\nthese nuanced things come together\nto build a full fledged application.\n\n42\n00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.262\nAnd that's my ultimate goal here\nis not driven by certification but\n\n43\n00:02:18.262 --> 00:02:22.737\nit is something that essentially you gain\nknowledge that you wouldn't necessarily\n\n44\n00:02:22.737 --> 00:02:24.010\nsee in other contexts.\n\n45\n00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.840\nSo yeah, no certification, but\n\n46\n00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.590\na lot of information in order\nto be had in this course.\n\n47\n00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.690\n&gt;&gt; And well worth your time to watch it.\n\n48\n00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.440\nAnd what topics are covered in this show?\n\n49\n00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.395\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna Firebase, React,\nCreate React App Build tools,\n\n50\n00:02:36.395 --> 00:02:41.501\nhow to manage your build server, how to\ndesign components, how to nest components.\n\n51\n00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:45.161\nAnd as well as deployment and\nusing the realtime database and\n\n52\n00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:48.300\nauthentication services within Firebase.\n\n53\n00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.470\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Justin.\n\n54\n00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.760\nSo make sure you watch every\nsingle episode of Chat app\n\n55\n00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.110\nwith reactive Firebase.\n\n56\n00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.200\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n57\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.284\nAnd thank you for watching DevProTV.\n\n58\n00:02:57.284 --> 00:03:02.443\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
