series.\n\n3\n00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.670\nAdam thanks for joining us today.\n\n4\n00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.660\nCould you please give us a general\noverview of what we can expect from\n\n5\n00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.345\nthis series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:15.827\n&gt;&gt; Small.\n\n7\n00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:18.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Absolutely.\n\n8\n00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.640\nLet's talk about what we expect here for\nour, upcoming conversation is about CHFI.\n\n9\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.040\nIt's very exciting when\nwe talk about forensics,\n\n10\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.260\ndigital forensics in particular.\n\n11\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.730\nThe things we're gonna take a look at,\n\n12\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.740\nmaybe some high level\ntopics we're gonna cover.\n\n13\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.980\nThings like, what are hard drives and\nfile systems?\n\n14\n00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.700\nHow do we forensically examine them?\n\n15\n00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.620\nWhat is the chain of custody of evidence?\n\n16\n00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.670\nWhat does it mean to forensically examine\nand gather data using a sound methodology?\n\n17\n00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.030\nWe're gonna detail what\nthat methodology is.\n\n18\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.480\nHow do we examine things like email?\n\n19\n00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.649\nWeb related services?\n\n20\n00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.413\nSo, web services and web systems,\nemail systems, law gathering and\n\n21\n00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:53.877\nnetwork forensics.\n\n22\n00:00:53.877 --> 00:00:57.882\nHow do we use common tools of the trade,\nthings like access to tool,\n\n23\n00:00:57.882 --> 00:01:00.151\naccess of the key forensics tool kit.\n\n24\n00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:04.590\nAnd case and oldie but a goody and a very,\nvery common tool what's steganography?\n\n25\n00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.880\nAnd what are we gonna do when we hide\nimages inside of other images or\n\n26\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.470\ndiscover that there and pulled them out.\n\n27\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.300\nSo to speak we're gonna take a look in\nall that, how do we do password cracking?\n\n28\n00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.060\nAnd somethings that may or may not be\ngender per say for the average individual.\n\n29\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.621\nWhen we think about investigation and\nforensics,\n\n30\n00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:24.307\nwe don't often think about system hacking,\nright?\n\n31\n00:01:24.307 --> 00:01:26.697\nBut we're gonna make the case for you and\n\n32\n00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:31.341\nI think persuasively that in order to be\ngood at being a systems investigator.\n\n33\n00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.533\nAt being a forensic investigator,\none of the most important things\n\n34\n00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.420\nyou need to understand how to\ndo is think like a hacker.\n\n35\n00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.860\nAnd as results,\nsome of the prerequisite knowledge and\n\n36\n00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.810\nthe things that we may be able to\nshow you, remind you, or teach you.\n\n37\n00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.360\nAnd or tell you that we've done another\nareas and then have you come back and\n\n38\n00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.100\ntake a look at in relation\nto the skills here are gonna\n\n39\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.870\nbe the subject of our conversation.\n\n40\n00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.550\n&gt;&gt; Adam, who would you say is\nthe intended audience for this CHFI?\n\n41\n00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.330\n&gt;&gt; Anybody who is looking, number one, to\ncertainly get into digital forensics and\n\n42\n00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330\nthe investigative process would\nbe a good candidate for this.\n\n43\n00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.810\nPeople that perhaps have a background\nwith things like security plus or\n\n44\n00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.780\nCASP from CompTIA, perhaps an SSCP\nfrom an ISE square perspective.\n\n45\n00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.630\nMaybe somebody who has maybe 18\nto 36 months, maybe even more,\n\n46\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.970\nexperience as a professional doing IT and\na security practitioner.\n\n47\n00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.536\nCertainly somebody who\nalready has their C-E-H or\n\n48\n00:02:24.536 --> 00:02:26.934\nis looking to gather those\nskills along the way.\n\n49\n00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:30.997\nWould be a good candidate for this kind of\nset of skills and ultimately this kind of\n\n50\n00:02:30.997 --> 00:02:34.369\nknowledge in terms of bringing\nthose skills back to the employer.\n\n51\n00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.451\nAnd helping them to then ultimately\ndo a better job of defending, but\n\n52\n00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:41.517\nalso understanding when a break-in occurs,\nhow to prevent it from happening again.\n\n53\n00:02:41.517 --> 00:02:45.277\n&gt;&gt; Well sounds great, now that we\nunderstand who the audience is and\n\n54\n00:02:45.277 --> 00:02:46.819\nwhat we can expect from the series.\n\n55\n00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.307\nCould you talk a little bit about\nthe exam itself give us maybe some\n\n56\n00:02:50.307 --> 00:02:51.497\ndetails about that.\n\n57\n00:02:51.497 --> 00:02:55.037\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, if we can go to my machine\nactually, we've got all that teed up for\n\n58\n00:02:55.037 --> 00:02:56.257\nyou right there.\n\n59\n00:02:56.257 --> 00:02:57.547\nThere we go, outstanding.\n\n60\n00:02:57.547 --> 00:03:02.237\nSo you can see all I've done is gone\nout to the EC council page for CHFI and\n\n61\n00:03:02.237 --> 00:03:04.164\nwe can go ahead and\nright there underneath.\n\n62\n00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:07.164\nCHFI down towards the bottom,\nwe see about the exam.\n\n63\n00:03:07.164 --> 00:03:11.626\nThe exam details currently sits at\n150 questions, passing score 70%.\n\n64\n00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:14.170\nYou do the math,\nyou could figure out what you need there.\n\n65\n00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.350\nAnd then of course, four hours in\noverall duration for the exam.\n\n66\n00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.620\nSo a little bit longer than some\nof the traditional exams we see.\n\n67\n00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.910\nExams don't tend to be quite as long\ncertainly Microsoft exams are not usually\n\n68\n00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.150\nquite as long, but some of the more\nheavy duty and extended exams.\n\n69\n00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.220\nWill certainly be at the four\nhour mark and above.\n\n70\n00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.790\nIt is multiple choice format\nas you could see there.\n\n71\n00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.330\nIt does say deliver\nthrough ECC exam portal.\n\n72\n00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.590\nBut you can also actually take that and\ninteract with that through Pearson VUE.\n\n73\n00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.335\nAnd we can actually\nregister at Pearson VUE.\n\n74\n00:03:43.335 --> 00:03:46.395\nSo when you wanna go in and\nget ready to actually take the exam,\n\n75\n00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:49.665\nas I'm sure you're gonna wanna do at some\npoint, you can go over to Pearson VUE.\n\n76\n00:03:49.665 --> 00:03:52.505\nRemember these days,\nPearson VUE does the online testing for\n\n77\n00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:53.865\njust about every major vendor.\n\n78\n00:03:53.865 --> 00:03:56.317\nThey do Microsoft's exams, they do Cisco,\n\n79\n00:03:56.317 --> 00:03:59.117\nthey do VMware, they do most of\nthe major vendors out there.\n\n80\n00:03:59.117 --> 00:04:01.937\nSo, no surprise they would\ndo EC Council as well.\n\n81\n00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:02.987\nOne thing to consider and\n\n82\n00:04:02.987 --> 00:04:06.707\nbe aware of, a lot of us may have\ncertifications from multiple vendors.\n\n83\n00:04:06.707 --> 00:04:09.127\nA lot of you May have them as well.\n\n84\n00:04:09.127 --> 00:04:14.645\nAnd if you have an account for let's say\nVMware or Cisco or Microsoft with Pearson.\n\n85\n00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:18.172\nYou're gonna have to create a separate one\nfor each of those vendors and obviously,\n\n86\n00:04:18.172 --> 00:04:20.430\nyou'll need a separate one for\nEC-Council as well.\n\n87\n00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.210\nSo even though you may\nalready be a customer so\n\n88\n00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.600\nto speak of Pearson you're gonna have to\ngo in and go through the process again.\n\n89\n00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.807\nSo you'll come into the Pearson website,\nfind the vendor list,\n\n90\n00:04:28.807 --> 00:04:32.437\nlook up EC-Council follow the instructions\nhere about how to register.\n\n91\n00:04:32.437 --> 00:04:35.257\nOne thing to keep in mind that when\nyou're going through and preparing for\n\n92\n00:04:35.257 --> 00:04:37.179\nany EC-Council exam,\nregardless of what it is.\n\n93\n00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:41.412\nThat there usually is a process that you\nhave to engage directly with EC Council to\n\n94\n00:04:41.412 --> 00:04:41.920\nfollow.\n\n95\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.620\nIn terms of validating that you're\nauthorized to take the exam,\n\n96\n00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.540\nthere's usually an NDA of some kind or\na responsibility\n\n97\n00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.370\nform you need to fill out to certify\nyou're not gonna use the skills.\n\n98\n00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.140\nThat we normally will show you\nhow to use for evil rather for\n\n99\n00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.110\ngood as I know you all will, right?\n\n100\n00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.435\nAnd so\nyou have to contact EC- Council directly.\n\n101\n00:04:59.435 --> 00:05:03.940\nECCouncil.org real simple to do follow\nthe instructions they may have there for\n\n102\n00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.120\nany one of their exams.\n\n103\n00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.160\nThere may be an application fee, there may\nbe a need for you to send in a resume.\n\n104\n00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.460\nThere's different requirements\ndepending on what it is.\n\n105\n00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.510\nAnd then once you've done that,\nyou're gonna get a validation code.\n\n106\n00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.720\nEssentially verification code, a voucher,\nis what they usually refer to it as.\n\n107\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.430\nThat's gonna give you the ability to come\nback to Pearson, apply, present that code,\n\n108\n00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.360\nand be validated for\nactually the ability to sit for the exam.\n\n109\n00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.890\nBecause without that code\nPearson VUE cannot register you\n\n110\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.750\nbecause EC-Council will not acknowledge\nyou as an authorized test taker.\n\n111\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.900\nSo just something to consider and be\naware of, but not a complicated process.\n\n112\n00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.350\nIt's actually very straightforward.\n\n113\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.090\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, that sounds fantastic.\n\n114\n00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.050\nAnd if that sounds like something\nthat you might be interested in,\n\n115\n00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.235\nwe look forward to seeing\nyou in our upcoming series.\n\n116\n00:05:43.235 --> 00:05:47.324\n[SOUND]\n\n",
